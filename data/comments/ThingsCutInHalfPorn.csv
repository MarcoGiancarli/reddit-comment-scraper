The sheer innovation and technological leap of am relatively accurate, guided, long distance missile is miles more impressive than strapping some uranium to a bomb. You also have to remember that the V2 program was done under the severe strains of war, rather than the Manhattan Project which took place in a relative time of peace. Wartime tends to strain the supply lines and infrastructure, which tends to make even simple production lines much more costly and inefficient."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3dr1uz,adambuck66,10,Sat Jul 18 23:40:52 2015 UTC,"Granted, that was the first ever Ariane 5 launch, and was caused by a software issue, not a hardware one. The rocket re-used software from the Ariane 4 launch vehicle. (Which is a normal and safe thing to do, and is considered good software development.) However, a software issue occurred when the on board computer attempted to convert a 64 bit float into a 16 bit integer. As it turned out, the 64 bit float (which represented the horizontal component of the launcher's velocity) was too large to be represented as a 16 bit integer. Normally, a situation like this could be handled by the computer without issue, however, in order to save on overhead and not exceed the 80% usage limit for the on board computer, this exception handling was disabled. When the error occurred, there was no way for the computer to handle it, and thus a full reboot was prompted. This caused diagnostic data, which is normally intended to test the gimbaling of the engines before launch, to be sent to the engines while still in flight. This caused the pitchover and break up of the vehicle."

If you're going to go as far as doing studs it doesn't make sense to leave the cooler in there.    Compounding the issues with the casting sand left in the block was the factory coolant that was not silicate free, which expedited the clogging of the oil cooler.    There was also the debacle of people running tuners and lifting their heads, then replacing the head gaskets with black onyx gaskets which were complete shit, and not decking their heads. Subsequently they were having failures again.    Lucking Victor Reinz, who makes FoMoCo's OEM Gaskets, was able to re-release a new line of Black Diamond HG's which are identical to the OEM gaskets, minus the FoMoCo blue sealant, as the Black Onyx HG's were not in spec.

He's put well over 150k miles on it and totes their truck bed camper all over the US with it with the only issue coming from a seized brake caliper. It sucks to have to dump money into a new car/truck, but they can be made into solid vehicles."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3didk0,jgollsneid,3,Thu Jul 16 20:23:33 2015 UTC,"In addition to the things that have been pointed out (EGR, head gaskets/head bolts, and oil coolers), the other major issue is that the 6.0 was designed to use ULSD (ultra low sulfur diesel). However, poor quality fuel with relatively high sulfur content was still widely available in the US until many years after the 6.0 was introduced. As a result, the soot produced by combustion built up in the EGR cooler, EGR valve, and the variable flow turbocharger vanes. When soot gets built up on these vanes, the turbo tends to get stuck in a low boost situation and won't accelerate worth a damn"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3didk0,DrSounds,0,Thu Jul 16 21:16:29 2015 UTC,Turbo variable vanes get carboned up and then cause over boosting. Blows out the head gasket.   EGR cooler and oil cooler issues.   Just a horrible vehicle.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3didk0,jgollsneid,2,Thu Jul 16 23:13:28 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that they tended to get stuck in the ""closed"" position, which is quick spool, low airflow. I could be wrong though.   But yeah, everyone talks about how once a 6 liter is bulletproofed it's a great motor, but I'm not too keen on dropping 3-5k extra on top of a vehicle that currently sells for around 12 to 15k.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d4ttw,SkepticalJohn,7,Mon Jul 13 17:56:29 2015 UTC,"Yesssss it is absolutely fantastic. If anyone ever intends to go there, please, for the love of God, don't pick up anything you see and take it for your own.  This stuff is prehistoric, and there are 3 or 4 beautifully preserved entire tree trunks that are lying fossilized on their sides, and if every person that visited the park took a piece, it'd all be gone in a week. Don't be an entitled cunt, respect the park."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d4ttw,VostokApollo,3,Mon Jul 13 17:43:40 2015 UTC,"In fact, the geologic formation that contains the wood is fairly widespread, and you can buy pieces in basically any rock shop without diminishing the park for future visitors."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d4ttw,masasin,2,Tue Jul 14 12:13:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting question and I am not 100% sure of the right answer, but I imagine it has something to do with the actual bark of the tree taking a lot longer to rot away, long enough for perhaps the opal source to be replaced by a darker rock that then filled the cavity left behind by the bark when it eventually rotted."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d4ttw,masasin,6,Wed Jul 15 19:02:12 2015 UTC,How do we know it is white oak? There is no wood to identify it by and the trunk profile doesn't look very white oak. It looks more like a cyprus or cedar? White oak tends to be pretty smooth and round where this has lots of ondulations.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d4ttw,GillicuttyMcAnus,-1,Mon Jul 13 17:45:54 2015 UTC,I think you're underestimating the cost of pieces like this.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d4ttw,UpBoatDownBoy,3,Mon Jul 13 18:00:28 2015 UTC,No? I'm just asking how do we know it is white oak when there is no wood to identify it?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d4ttw,GillicuttyMcAnus,7,Mon Jul 13 18:03:11 2015 UTC,Its not white oak. Someone else identified this piece as coming from a national park with fossils of 9 tree species (all extinct). OP is full of shit.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d4ttw,breovus,6,Mon Jul 13 18:15:39 2015 UTC,"Oh that's weird, i was trying to respond to the other guy that was talking about using this for flooring. Sorry about that."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d4ttw,ThisIs_MyName,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:49:28 2015 UTC,"From a few seconds of googling, it seems like this tile is about 100 times more expensive than conventional tile. Getting a decent square foot price is somewhat difficult and obviously tile ranges in cost but this petrified wood is an order of magnitude or two more expensive.    You really don't think that sounds odd? A tiny bathroom might be 6x4 ft or 24 sqft not including the shower and walls... And that would be $6000 in tile. That's not even including labor or required grout."

I couldn't quite understand how a theater could be so complicated and have so many secret places after having only seen the stage in my small town high-school gym.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d3rm9,carn2fex,2,Mon Jul 13 15:54:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I just wasted 2hrs of my life going down a rabbit hole of google searches after seeing this picture lol.  Was quite interesting though.  From seeing all the interior pictures, to learning about the underground lake in the basement.  One thing I found quite interesting...Estimates put the cost to build this place at just over 36 million Francs, in 1875.  That was equal to about 18million US dollars at the time.  Just adjusting for inflation, that would be around half a billion US dollars today.  However, if you were to build this structure today, you'd have to adjust labor rates (they adjust much different than historical inflation data), and this place would cost somewhere between 2.6 and 4.5 Billion US dollars to build today."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d3rm9,descarts,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:00:19 2015 UTC,I'd love to hear some explanation about the portal above the main auditorium seating. It looks like something to control the inlet of natural light...  That and why there are so many levels of angled flooring below the stage.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d3rm9,perpetualjon,3,Mon Jul 13 22:20:35 2015 UTC,"That huge portal is for the chandelier, to allow them to raise, lower and monitor it. Or in the case of The Phantom of the Opera. To drop it on the auditorium. As for the angled flooring, as I recall, there is pretty much a small lake in the basement for the hydraulics. Not sure if its still there, but I think that's the original reason.  Edit: This gives a better example of how the chandelier works(worked?). As for the lake, I checked and its still there, so yay! This site has a lot of pictures of the lake and how a lot of the Phantom of the Opera actually existed or happened."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,ImmortalTrader,16,Sun Jul 12 17:21:03 2015 UTC,What kind of tools are used to make the rifling on a barrel this big (or any barrel for that matter)?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,natrlselection,12,Sun Jul 12 19:38:07 2015 UTC,"Some barrels have rifling cut (with  button rifler, for example) after the barrel is formed.  other barrels are forged around an inverted form that already has the rifling present."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,loansindi,3,Sun Jul 12 20:55:39 2015 UTC,Cool. Is one better/stronger than the other?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,natrlselection,3,Sun Jul 12 21:28:52 2015 UTC,"If wager forged is stronger, but prone to breaking due to being stiffer."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,AVeryHeavyBurtation,4,Sun Jul 12 20:27:50 2015 UTC,"Im going to assume its hammer forged. Its more expensive, but if its a military doing it, then who cares how much it cost. It makes a stronger barrel. Then it looks like they applied a chrome lining to it, to make it even stronger and to protect the rifling from getting beat up from the elements."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,LynchMob_Lerry,2,Mon Jul 13 02:19:01 2015 UTC,That's certainly looks like a process to make the raw barrels. It would still need to be machined to spec.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,erktheerk,2,Mon Jul 13 02:52:56 2015 UTC,"Well sure the outside would, but the hammer forging process is how the rifling is put into the barrels. One reason why people like military surplus barrels in rifles because they are better then button barrels, or the process you showed."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,LynchMob_Lerry,2,Mon Jul 13 03:02:57 2015 UTC,Oh OK. Barrels looked smooth to me at the end of the video.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,erktheerk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:17:10 2015 UTC,Well it very well could have been. If its a tank barrel then it would have been a smooth bore.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,LynchMob_Lerry,2,Mon Jul 13 03:33:37 2015 UTC,This post we are commenting on has a grooved barrel on a tank. I don't understand what you're saying. this method looks more like how they shape the material than a finished product.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,erktheerk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:37:32 2015 UTC,"Right. The hammer forging process can be used either way. Its the same process used in small arms barrels and how they make AR15 lowers. The smash the steel into the shape they want it, making a stronger end product. It doesnt matter if its used to make rifled or smooth bore, but once the hammer forging processes is over the insides are done, other then putting a chamber in if its a rifle barrel."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,rasiisar,20,Sun Jul 12 17:57:10 2015 UTC,"If you're unaware, that's called rifling, which imparts a spin on the projectile. Helps it to follow a straighter/ more controlled path."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,rasiisar,12,Sun Jul 12 18:35:50 2015 UTC,Probably a function of how fast the projectile exits the barrel.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,romulusnr,2,Sun Jul 12 21:22:17 2015 UTC,"As others has said its called rifling, but on the M1 Abrams and a few other countries use a smooth bore. This way you can put the rifling on the shell you are launching and not the barrel. This way you can have a wider range of projectiles you can shoot."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,LynchMob_Lerry,3,Mon Jul 13 01:19:12 2015 UTC,"FWIW, the projectiles aren't rifled either. Smooth bore main guns are used mostly because of the switch to APFSDS (armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot) rounds, which are fin stabilized (not spin stabilized) due to their length. AFAIK, when HEAT or squash head rounds are shot from a smooth bore, they are also fin stabilized."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,szczypka,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:51:12 2015 UTC,"Rifling is typically measured in inches per turn. Rifles usually fall somewhere between 1 turn in 6"" and 1 in 16"" - they will have at least one and sometimes several full turns in the length of the barrel. Handguns usually have a much slower twist - 1 in 32"" is common for .38 special for example. I don't know what the figure is for this cannon barrel, but it looks much slower than you'd find on a rifle."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,PeanutNore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:45:46 2015 UTC,"It's much less because of the higher muzzle velocity and larger moment of inertia of the projectile.  I was surprised that it's around one revolution, I would have expected a quarter or less."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,PeanutNore,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:20:19 2015 UTC,It's done that way because it's very important for accuracy that the crown of the barrel (the part where the rifling ends) is cut evenly. By having it set back a few centimeters from the muzzle it prevents damage to the crown.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,masuk0,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:49:02 2015 UTC,Is the thing around the barrel ejector? Shouldn't it be connected with inside in some way?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3d138r,PeanutNore,2,Mon Jul 13 09:28:04 2015 UTC,It looks like it's a bore evacuator. The port from the bore into it was probably on the top of the barrel that was cut away. It keeps toxic gasses from entering the fighting compartment of the tank when the cannon breech is opened after firing.

Two are still functioning.    The liberty ships Jeremiah O'Brien and John Brown (based in San Francisco and Baltimore) are both still operation and would be the closest thing to what's pictured above.  Aside from that, you can visit HMS Warrior over in England, which is a very early example of a steam-powered warship, Aurora in St. Petersburg, or USS Olympia in Philadelphia.  There're plenty more preserved steam-powered ships out there.  Of these, I've only seen Olympia.  If you go on the first Saturday of the month, you can go on the extended tour and see one of her engine rooms and one of her boiler rooms."

And a sauna? we're lucky to have decent showers with warm water and washing machines which don't leave your clothes with rust stains. I have however been down in the bow observatory dome of a ship once - they don't include those on the new research vessels anymore because the benefit isn't worth the hassle.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3ct76d,takesthebiscuit,24,Fri Jul 10 17:30:22 2015 UTC,A big reason is to make sure there's not standing water in the hydrant so the water doesn't freeze. The hydrant will drain itself when the valve to main is closed. These hydrants are commonly found in colder climates. This graph shows a dry hydrant
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3ct76d,halliganbeer,3,Fri Jul 10 17:50:22 2015 UTC,"The UK hydrants described by @takesthebuscuit has the same advantage. The main value is underground and doesn't freeze.

Both the UK and European standard state a minimum flow rate of 2000 l/min (put the at thingy in here) 1.7 Bar. However, there’s no requirement for the water authority to push the water through at that rate, which rather defeats the object in the hydrant standard!!!""

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3ct76d,diroussel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:54:23 2015 UTC,"I know i'm late and you're asking about UK hydrants, but in Aus we have a similar setup as the one /u/diroussel mentioned for the ""street hydrants"" provided by the local government.  Example of an in-ground hydrant typically found on water mains throughout Australia, and how it looks from the street.  We connect in to the hydrants using a standpipe and then typically a hose is run to the firetruck which uses its internal pump to pressurise the water (known as a ""feed"" system). We also have above-ground type hydrants which are typically required to be installed on the premises of any building exceeding 500m2 on their own dedicated fire main.  Depending on the water pressure and flows available they will either be used as ""feed"" hydrants like a street hydrant, or ""attack"" hydrants that are boosted by a firetruck using a booster assembly that is located at the entrance to the property. The hydrant on the left is used as a ""feed"" hydrant for firetruck suction, which then pumps into the inlets on the right to pressurise the fire main.  If the flows and pressures needed can't be achieved, a permanent pump system will be installed to increase pressures. depending on the water authority and water available, tanks may need to be installed also.  Pressure and flow requirements:  The flow required is determined by the size of the building. 20L/S is typical for most buildings. You need a minimum of 200kpa for ""feed"" hydrants, and they need to be far enough away for the truck to safely access while remaining clear of the building. 350kpa is standard for ""attack"" hydrants where your coverage provided is taken directly from the hydrant.  If a pump system is in place then the water flow required is halved, and the pressure is increased to 700kpa.  My knowledge relates to mainly Queensland fire systems, but is pretty typical for Australia (under AS2419). Hope that helps :)"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3c21du,Zaz1920,5,Sat Jul 4 19:23:57 2015 UTC,I'll be honest for the fist 6 months I did not treat it like I should have until I subbed to RX8 club. The last 3.5 years I did all the things you listed. Especially revving before and after driving. Those puppies can flood easy.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3c21du,Surelyyoucantbcereal,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:32:29 2015 UTC,"Why revving before? If you rev before, particularly when the engine is cold, that's definitely not good for it.  Revving after is only necessary when the engine hasn't warmed up, so really only an issue if you've driven a very short distance before turning the engine off. Flooding should basically never occur after the engine has warmed and sometimes if the engine wasn't warm."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3c21du,Jrummmmy,4,Sat Jul 4 21:40:55 2015 UTC,Mazda's 787b won the 24h of Le Mans in 1991 before getting outlawed. The Rx-8 actually uses the same engine as the 3rd gen Rx-7 except without the turbos. A significant portion of the reliability issues with the Rx-7 actually relate to the complicated turbo system. Apex seals become an issue when people don't change/refill the oil as often as they should and run higher boost without properly tuning the engine.  Source: personally own a 3rd gen Rx-7 and an Rx-8 is in the family

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3c21du,Jrummmmy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:49:55 2015 UTC,Yah know I've only briefly looked into it and couldn't find an adequate answer. I think along those lines it was just too small and light compared for the power output that the piston engines couldn't quite compete. It would be hard to regulate in comparison to piston engines. Regular displacement measurements don't compare so it'd be hard to limit.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3c21du,Zaz1920,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:52:00 2015 UTC,While they are both 13b engines there are a lot more differences between them than just removing the turbos. There have been a lot or revisions of that engine and the Renesis was made to be NA and produce a pretty solid amount of hp without a turbo. It is more than just changing the rotors/compression. I'm no expert on 13b's so I can't talk about all the big changes but going from peripheral ports to side ports was a major change. There are definitely more things than that though.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3c21du,mikarm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:46:27 2015 UTC,"The RX-8's engine is still a 13B, but definitely not the same as the engine in the RX-7 without the turbos. The same engine in the 7 would not make as much power, at least not while keeping with emissions requirements and driveability for the typical consumer.  The RX-8 used a new design for the ports. It introduced side ports for the exhaust, which came with benefits and problems. It contributed to making it the highest NA rotary engine produced. There were also changes to the apex seals and the water jacket, which were also linked to the changes in ports. Some of the problems that appeared from this were things like carbon build up and stress from the apex seals passing over the ports."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3c21du,notasrelevant,2,Sun Jul 12 14:01:11 2015 UTC,"The last few years has been won by deisel audis, Porsche taking it this year.   IIRC the reason that the apex seals always go is because of an oversight with the spark plug holes, they're far bigger than the seal, so your intake and exhaust gasses mix."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3c21du,Redbulldildo,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:39:17 2015 UTC,"Rotaries haven't been allowed in the Le Mans for a while, though they were quite successful when they did compete. The RX-8 isn't that unreliable. It definitely had some issues early on and they made some corrections that made them much better. Assuming you're joking about the plastic seals comment..."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3c21du,notasrelevant,-1,Sun Jul 12 13:55:36 2015 UTC,A lot of people think rotaries are incredibly unreliable   Because they are. Those are not reliable engines.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3c21du,nullsignature,2,Sat Jul 4 21:12:21 2015 UTC,They gracefully fail over time with a decrease in output power rather than catastrophically like piston engines can. When they overheat the case expands more than the rotor. This makes them quite suitable for aircraft but they need overhauls far more often than modern piston engines. I would say they are very reliable when serviced well
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3c21du,Noobymcnoobcake,2,Sat Jul 4 22:46:43 2015 UTC,"If you need to overhaul it more often, then it's not very reliable, is it? Both piston and rotary engines can fail 'gracefully' or 'catastrophically'"

It's not necessarily something you did wrong, but your experience is hardly typical.  When you say 160 hp, are you talking about other engines or possibly the automatic version? MT models had 232 hp, or around 200 hp at the wheels. The AT models were putting out something closer to the 160 hp you mentioned, at the wheels. If you had an automatic, particularly the 4-port model, then that would definitely be a good explanation for your experience."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3bczjz,FlingingDice,9,Sun Jun 28 17:13:26 2015 UTC,This is what I always try to point out to people who dig on my ikea stuff.  It's not WalMart's flat pack stuff.  it costs about 50% more and it's much more durable.  Walmart desk tops are usually wood chips held together with what essentially seems to be wax.  Ikea does this stuff with the honeycomb interior.  People think all flat pack furniture is crap and somehow what you buy at a furniture store isn't the same materials.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3bczjz,havoc3d,7,Sun Jun 28 21:04:20 2015 UTC,"People also underestimate the value in Ikea parts when it comes to making the furniture you want, by combining their table tops/legs in ways they don't intend.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3bczjz,AmericanGeezus,2,Mon Jun 29 00:33:33 2015 UTC,Oh yeah.  I love that most of their stuff is available as sketchup files.  I planned my current desk out with simple work surfaces/legs and sketchup
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3bczjz,havoc3d,3,Mon Jun 29 02:29:44 2015 UTC,I've found Ikea stuff to be a lot easier to assemble square compared to other makers. I think it's all wood pins they use in addition to the metal ones that lock in with the 1/2 turn thingy.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3bczjz,YellowCBR,12,Sun Jun 28 19:47:37 2015 UTC,"Audi and VW aren't comparable.  Honda is expensive compared to other brands of similar quality, like Toyota or Mazda.  Lets be honest here, Honda only sells cars because of their name.

I'm willing to bet the options are going to add up a lot faster on the latter too, same as it does here. They're just more common there, since, I'd argue, cars are not an absolute necessity like they are here, so those who do own them don't treat them as such."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3bczjz,Airazz,0,Mon Jun 29 04:10:46 2015 UTC,"328i seems to be way higher class car than a Mondeo, I think.  Here a new Mondeo costs 22 000 euros, new BMW 114i (5 door version) costs 24 000. Not that much of a difference. It's even smaller with used cars."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3bczjz,Airazz,-8,Sun Jun 28 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"Because you have a grand total of five VW owners in your circle of friends, which is a very low sample size?  It is quality, especially when compared to French or American brands."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3bczjz,SixAlarmFire,5,Sun Jun 28 20:32:01 2015 UTC,"You have no idea who I know and don't know.  I have known a large number of Volkswagen owners and many of the vehicles were lemons and had major transmission problems before they even hit 50,000 miles.   Now that makes them seem as not on par with quality of an Audi - which to my knowledge is a pretty sweet ride - but I HAVE only had a handful of friends who owned Audis, so I don't know personally if they are as big of pieces of shits as VWs."

A single beam can't stand a lot of weight, in any direction. A beam which is thick enough to stand the compression would be too expensive and heavy so you put two beams and you separate them with a vertical one, making a H Beam. Now it is hard, light and cheap. Tricell is used for jet fighter wings or furniture. It is so cheap and light for what you get that it's a great product.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,Q_ballin,207,Sat Jun 27 12:32:26 2015 UTC,"There's a lot going on in there, but one of the big design issues with windows is their insulating value. It's pretty easy to insulate walls so they keep heat in/out, but windows screw everything up.   Metal windows are especially bad, because metal is such a good heat conductor. A very simple aluminum frame will just constantly be transmitting temperature through it.   So nicer windows have thermal breaks designed in them. That's what the black sections are. They're likely rubber pieces that insulate the interior pieces of aluminum from the exterior pieces, and in doing so, slow the rate of heat transfer.   The downside is that any time you replace some of that aluminum frame with rubber, you're decreasing the structural strength of that window frame. One of the reasons why it's so complicated is to try to increase the strength of the frame to compensate."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,ToTouchAnEmu,5,Sat Jun 27 19:06:13 2015 UTC,In industry we still get variation from batch to batch.  This is why production relies on (for polyesters anyways) titration and viscosity measurement in order to find the end point.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,Towerful,9,Sat Jun 27 14:20:05 2015 UTC,"It probably works reasonably well in that regard too. A nice coincidence in architecture is that, in general, things you do for thermal insulation tend to help with acoustical insulation as well.   I can't remember any job that I've worked on where the acoustical properties of the windows was a driving factor in their selection, but I'm sure it's a bigger issue for some buildings. I work primarily on the gulf coast, so our biggest hassle is actually wind ratings and missile impact ratings. Finding nice window assemblies that meet code here can be pretty tough and expensive."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,shawnaroo,4,Sat Jun 27 14:47:53 2015 UTC,missile ... impact ratings?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,shawnaroo,12,Sat Jun 27 15:16:44 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it's not anything nearly as exciting as cruise missiles. It has to do with objects being thrown at windows by powerful storms such as hurricanes. They actually have testing equipment that fires 2x4's at building components to see if they survive.   Anyways, it can be really bad news to have a window knocked out during a hurricane. It creates an opening in the building, and if the wind is blowing directly into that opening but doesn't have a way to get out of the building, it can create a very significant pressure differential between the inside of the building and the outside, and that can do things like cause the roof to peel off, or cause other severe structural damage.   It's more an issue in wood framed buildings, and proper strapping can greatly reduce the chances of that happening, but still, code generally has missile impact rating requirements.   It's not that hard to find a single window that passes, but it becomes a bigger issue when you have a larger window assembly. This bigger window is actually three windows stuck together, and by code, that entire window assembly needs to have passed the missile impact tests. A lot of window manufacturers may have tested their individual windows, but not all the possible assemblies that a designer might want to put in their building. Getting the tests done takes time and money, so it's not like you can just call them up and get any assembly approved easily."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,Kwindecent_exposure,2,Sat Jun 27 16:17:09 2015 UTC,"Great line of thinking, however I must firstly correct the guy you're replying to, as the material is not rubber but a polyamide 'nylon'.  There are however other methods of dampening acoustics employed in the above product (which, as Shawnaroo mentions are happy byproducts of thermal insulation) such as the air gap. Another well documented approach would be to use two different thicknesses of glass in the IGU. If you understand that differing thicknesses of materials can filter out a large range of acoustic energy, yet all have a certain wavelength to which that particular thickness of glass isn't good at dealing with you will then understand that the use of different thicknesses. It filters two different frequency ranges out of the transmission of sound energy from outside, rather than having two panes of the same thickness in which the secondary is far less effective for acoustic performance as any frequencies (of sound energy) that are able to penetrate the first will also be able to penetrate the second, albeit with a little less oomph.  Secondly, while increasing the thickness of the glazing helps massively in decreasing the penetration of a large range of frequencies, it is not always practical to have ""three and half inch thick"" glass. Another advantage to tuned IGUs there. Given the thermal properties of the frame, it appears that the glazing in the image is actually not glass at all but is a couple layers of acrylic laminate material, and it doesn't represent what you'd typically see. Perhaps for impact resistance or more likely just because this is a model for display purposes of showing off the frame sections."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,jpberkland,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:32:55 2015 UTC,"Good question. Sometimes sound transmission is a consideration. In California, the building code (basically the law governing construction) some spaces are required to meet a minimum level of quiet-ness from outside sources and inside sources. A residential space near a train track or highway may need a walls and windows and doors with a better sound blocking properties (Sound Transmission Class)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,hambonezred,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"STC is usually best addressed with the glass unit. Usually throwing mass at the glass brings the STC rating down, ie using thicker/laminated glass.  The frame itself is a factor though."

That being the case, any concerns about structural integrity are negligible even in high wind load, static sash load and extreme thermal scenario.. ..unlike the severe concern I would have for the older style of solid rubber link blocks which do feature have poor structural properties, and can perish quite a bit faster.   Now, depending on what you mean by 'rubber', I will also note that even the external weather seals are most likely to be a more modern material these days such as Santoprene* (TPV) including bonded (co-extruded) materials for specific applications, and is not the same thing as the rubber used for the tyres on your motorbike.  *[There are only a very small number of manufacturers around the world with their own patented seals which sell to window manufacturers suppliers and installers, Santoprene is one of the materials on offer.]"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,hambonezred,2,Sun Jun 28 03:51:48 2015 UTC,"Yup.  This is a strut system here, the other way is a poured and debridged thermal break.    In this system pieces are joined using a thermal break that is then crimped into the 2 pieces of frame.    With poured and debridged the pieces are made as one and then a Polyurethane filler is poured in the space and then the bit of aluminum that joins the two is then cut away."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,PostPostModernism,12,Sat Jun 27 12:53:52 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing based on the size of the components and glass that this is intended for a high rise, where it will be subjected to a lot of wind force.  So it's designed to be very strong, but you don't want it to be too heavy since you're going to have hundreds or even thousands of them to support.  So you have to find a balance between creating a lot of strength with more material  and making it as light as possible.    This is further complicated by the black center which is a different material incorporated to reduce heat transmission.  This is great from the point of view of reducing heating bills, but creates another structural weakness that has to be overcome.  You could make this much more simply if you didn't bother with that.    The last bit of complication is that all of the pieces slot together and need to be weather-proof.  You have the fixed frame on the left which needs to seal with the operable frame on the right, which needs to seal and lock to the actual window frame itself."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,evilbrent,12,Sun Jun 28 04:39:42 2015 UTC,"Aluminium extrusion is cool. As long as you keep the wall thicknesses basically even you can do whatever the fuck you like.  Plastics you need to keep in mind open/shut direction of the tool, everything that undercuts that, you have to understand means adding sliders to the tool. Not impossible, but not cheap.  Steel press tools are similar. Obviously the tool has a pressing direction. You CAN do things from the side (like punching or forming etc) out of plane, but then you don't just have the slider issue, you have to be able to prove that the material will even BE there (not much point doing a punching operation on a piece that hasn't even been folded into position yet for example).  Steel casting is like injection moulding but without the sliders. Or top half of the tool. basically you get a mould to pour into.  3D printing you can simply do anything you can imagine.  But aluminum extrusion is cool. If you keep wall thickness uniform, basically you can just make whatever you like as long as it's a 2D shape. Just keep in mind that the linear cost is fucking huge, and so every mm2 is going to be utterly neccesary, then just go crazy. Put things where you want things. it's great.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,evilbrent,3,Sat Jun 27 14:18:38 2015 UTC,Doesn't work like that in plastic (injection moulding): the 'pieces' are just part of the mould that meet in the middle.  In edxtrusion moulds (aluminium or plastic) the hollow bits of the die obviously have to be connected to the tool - this is a long thin web that is connectedinto the fluid part of the melted substrate.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,anomalous_cowherd,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"So the 'disconnected' bits are attached to the mould at a point in the flow before the plastic/aluminum starts to set.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,evilbrent,2,Sat Jun 27 14:35:51 2015 UTC,"ummm... i may have cheated a bit in my explanation.  to be clear: an EXTRUSION die pushes molten material through a stationary die and it hardens and solidifies as it goes through the die. The piece is whatever you push out of the the die, and you cut off a bit. This is a continuous process.  And INJECTION moulding tool squirts liquid material into a die and holds it there until it's cool and solidifies. Then you have to figure out a way to open the die to get the piece out. Injection moulding is not quite a conintuous process - you do it one shot at a time."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,lickmycheese,3,Sat Jun 27 15:55:55 2015 UTC,"In plastics it depends upon the material and tool maker.  Most tools with hollow sections or voids would have bridges deep in the die to allow material to flow around and come together towards the middle or end plate, generally in the land section.  I have seen tool makers keep the separations till the material exited the die and just make it a pain to form the material properly but may have had limits on the tool making equipment."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,PostPostModernism,7,Sun Jun 28 01:02:16 2015 UTC,Probably for a skyscraper.  Protects it from flying debris and crazy people.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,lolcop01,6,Sat Jun 27 13:11:28 2015 UTC,"Nope, this would be just unreasonably thick. This looks more like a demo piece to just show off the window construction. Usually they just put thick acrylic glass blocks inside to demonstrate where the glass is going to be. Source: worked for a window construction company. The thickest single glass panes we installed were 12 mm glass+spacer+12 mm glass again. The 12 mm glass was actually two panes glued together and with some kind of foil between them to prevent the glass from shattering. It can get even thicker, but with thinner single panes. Something like 6+14+6+14+6 (6 mm glass + 14 mm spacer) was really common because it was one of the most insulating combinations and people here in Austria got some money from the government for using high-insulating windows."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,Astaro,6,Sat Jun 27 14:29:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's emulating a multi-layer insulated glass panel, which is why it seems so thick. There seems to be 5 layers. So the outermost layers, and the center layer would be normal glass, and the 2 intermediate layers would only be spacers around the edges.  The people who put the display together probably couldn't cut an insulated panel without smashing it, so they just stacked up glass panes of appropriate thickness."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,PostPostModernism,3,Sat Jun 27 15:31:18 2015 UTC,"This is just my guess, but this is probably a curtain wall system for a high rise.  It would be for an entire wall of glass windows, not a punched opening where it gets framed into 2x4s.  The thick glass would be to protect from high-wind debris.  I think you'd be surprised how strong that frame is."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,TaterNubbz,2,Sat Jun 27 13:17:13 2015 UTC,"It snaps together, but you have to hammer it in with a rubber mallet. You also have to drill holes through it to screw certain parts together. It comes in 24 foot stock lengths, they just cut it to what they need."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,evilbrent,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:24:30 2015 UTC,Tek screws.  No holes needed.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,aintitashame,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:32:39 2015 UTC,But through what? with the above profile one could open the window and put a screw through the plastic thermal breaks but that negates it's usefulness and doesn't result in a strong fasten.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,anomalous_cowherd,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, there's the hinge and the thicker curved piece which takes the strain. then there are rubber seals on each piece which are pressed together near the back. The join on the opening face is directly above where the rubber seals meet.  At the back of the frame there's a darker insert which could be steel or something nice and rigid which is screwed to a side wall, either through the large rubber seal or before it gets fitted. Or you screw one or both box sections at front and back.  This window could be for some sort of metal framed building where there are no rough openings where you need to absorb the difference, only nice straight square solid edges."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,anomalous_cowherd,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:02:36 2015 UTC,"That 'glass' could be thick perspex fitted for display purposes, in actual use it could be a double glazed panel, it's thick enough?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3barze,anomalous_cowherd,2,Sat Jun 27 14:14:34 2015 UTC,"True, I guess it's a stiff plastic - that frame needs rigidity because the other end of that box is only rubber/silicon.  Screw through one or both walls of the box sections then."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3bb7in,smashing3000,3,Fri Jul 3 14:13:28 2015 UTC,"Because of how it is drawn, isometrically, it can be difficult to line things up correctly or viewed correctly.  In this case, due to the perspective of the drawing, the tree may appear to be outside Lisa's room, yet it's actually outside Bart's.  Or, it could be as simple as minor human error on the part of the artist.  Plus we have to remember that many things in the Simpsons are changed to fit the narrative. For instance, there are times when there is a branch that extends to actually touch Bart's window, as we see in a few Halloween episodes, or simply reaches out enough for him to climb from his window onto a branch. Other times, there is a branch that extends to Lisa's window, allowing for movement between the two windows. AND, in the movie, the tree's limbs extend so far as to be close enough to the Flanders' house for Bart to scurry to get a hot chocolate Ned leaves on a windowsill."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3arn94,masterwit,14,Tue Jun 23 05:44:47 2015 UTC,"Hehe, that's super cute :) We call things submarine power cables because we're using the adjective of submarine, not the noun, which simply means ""underwater"". It sounds like you took this phrase and kinda thought, ""well when in the world would a submarine need to be plugged in?"" :)  But yes, I think you're correct in that this is not actually an undersea fiber optic cable. Those, best I can tell, exclusively have fiber running through the center of the cable, and don't appear to be manufactured in this tri-cable type setup."

Before you start an actual production run, you need to fill the extrusion machinery (after a cleansing) and keep it running idle a while to rinse the machinery from any crap that remained from cleaning it or from a short downtime (stuff may start to vulcanize/crosslink in the machinery when it stands still), set its parameters up and adjust the injection tools.

Instead they have a coil around the wires, and if incoming and outgoing current is not precisely equal, a small current is induced in the coil, which causes the breaker to open.  There are also earth-fault breakers which will trigger if there is any voltage in the grounding wire."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3ahri3,Minimalphilia,3,Sat Jun 20 15:16:01 2015 UTC,Kebab is the Meat which is not in a Burrito (so the absolute term would technically be Dürüm Döner Kebab) If it is good quality they actually stick Slices of spiced meat onto each other which they then roast on a spinning stick from which they scrape it off like here.  Bad quality Kebab is when it is made of minced meat instead.  There are no beans or rice inside and everything besides the kebab meat is absolutely optional. I like mine with feta cheese for example.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3ahri3,vldmr86,7,Sat Jun 20 15:30:58 2015 UTC,"And here's the Mexican equivalent, Al Pastor."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3ahri3,Minimalphilia,2,Sat Jun 20 15:53:39 2015 UTC,It is... beautiful. I am speechless.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3ahri3,anotherkeebler,2,Sat Jun 20 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"It's pork, and the drippings from that pineapple make it sweet and tender.  Delicious."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3ahri3,vldmr86,4,Sat Jun 20 18:44:35 2015 UTC,It's a pineapple.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3ahri3,anotherkeebler,2,Sat Jun 20 21:09:14 2015 UTC,"Sounds yummy. In the US you can get gyro, which is the Greek equivalent—meat, lettuce, some tzatziki sauce all wrapped in a pita. Turkish cuisine is less common outside of the largest cities."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3ahri3,Minimalphilia,3,Sat Jun 20 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we have Gyros as well. It is basically the same (and awesome), but the Greeks and the Turkish hate each other's guts so they would never admit any of the many similarities between their cultures.  Get some Gyro and stuff it in some Pita Bread, Sriracha/jogurthdress that thing and add some lettuce and tomatoes plus cabbage is always nice."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3afske,Ladrohpo,2,Thu Jun 25 00:48:49 2015 UTC,Like on planes?  It might be been an issue with the drilling/slotting of the rotors I saw.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3afske,Victorhcj,3,Thu Jun 25 01:00:03 2015 UTC,"F1 cars use Carbon-Carbon brakes too, but it probably doesn't have them. As for them getting hot, it would.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3afske,fairly_quiet,7,Sat Jun 20 01:48:33 2015 UTC,I was wondering about that too because it seems that there was suddenly no suspension up front. A commentor on the linked video suggests it was a failed control arm (which means it just happened to snap when the car scraped on the plate but easily could have snapped at highway speeds).  Also found this side view where you see the car has suspension then suddenly doesn't up front.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGV-MtUvrtA

It must be some sort of a disabling feature, you can see both front wheels momentarily leave the ground to retract up into the car.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3afske,AngryPandaEcnal,7,Fri Jul 3 11:41:45 2015 UTC,It's built on a GM Topkick chassis. Those are medium-duty trucks and the car probably only has a six-speed auto. 18-wheelers have something like 16-24 gears to get up to highway speeds.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3afske,fidelitypdx,9,Fri Jun 19 22:02:51 2015 UTC,"18-wheelers have something like 16-24 gears to get up to highway speeds.   10 gears is pretty standard for an over the road truck that grosses up to 80,000lbs. 13 or 18 gears is common in heavier-haul situations."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3afske,bitshoptyler,5,Fri Jun 19 22:42:45 2015 UTC,"Well diesels make much more torque than gas powered cars.  I can't tell if you're saying ""is a diesel"" in a negative tone or not, but it's definitely good that it isn't gasoline powered."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3afske,B0rax,5,Sat Jun 20 00:49:51 2015 UTC,Weight doesn't affect top speed much (on level ground anyway).  Top speed is when the drag on the car is equal to the torque at the wheels.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3afske,KderNacht,3,Sat Jun 20 01:49:46 2015 UTC,"That said, the weight affects the gearing that you'll need, and the gearing does affect the top speed. In order to get something heavy moving quickly, you'll need a dozen or so gears, like a tractor-trailer."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3afske,colincush,14,Sat Jun 20 04:59:22 2015 UTC,Probably not.

I imagine the ""top speed"" is relational to safe operating speeds within the convoy. You don't want two of these puppies bumping into each other if one needs to suddenly slam on the breaks going down a highway at 90mph, so with convoy spacing probably being only 20 feet or so, 60mph is likely cutting it pretty close from a safety perspective, and therefore is the top operating speed.  Maximum top speed is probably well over 100 mph."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3afske,stankbucket,3,Sat Jun 20 03:33:36 2015 UTC,"I.e, the President's helicopter is ""Marine One"" - and this is why Marines greet the President when he gets off.   It's also interesting to note that only the Marines transport the President by helicopter, and only the Air Force transports the President by fixed wing under normal conditions. So, unless something seriously terrible happens, there won't be ""Army One"" or ""Navy One"", but they would receive that designation if that was the case.   The only ""Navy One"" was the one Bush did during that terrible publicity stunt ""Mission Accomplished"" to celebrate the end of the Iraq War. There was several ""Army One"" aircraft, prior to 1976.   As far as I know, the president doesn't travel by boat, but if he did, it wouldn't have a name change. It's bad luck to rename a boat."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3afske,BCMM,32,Fri Jun 19 22:32:31 2015 UTC,IV drip will just rehydrate and give you certain proteins and vitamins that your body lacks at the time. A full blood transfusion (of your own blood) would remove a very large part of the alcohol in your system because the alcohol is in your blood.

Unless one side is much thicker than the other, this quite literally has been cut in half. Half does not mean that there is one plane to cut on. half does not mean the left and right are the only halves to cut apart. The front half and the back half are separated. The thing is, cross-sections only apply when making a model or drafting. While this would fit the bill, I fail to see how you can deny that it is cut in half."

To peel, you take two separate objects, and you release the bond between them.   To cut, you take a mechanical way to cut through the object in ways that you can not just separate normally.  Cutting a sticker in half, you'd see the inside of the paper.  Peeling a sticker, you'd see the plastic and the paper layer, etc etc."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,code-,45,Thu Jun 18 16:21:08 2015 UTC,"They've been putting RFIDs in credit cards for a long time (not all cards have them though). Mastercard PayPass has been around for more than 10 years. They all go by different names. Visa has payWave, American Express has Express Pay, and Discover has Zip.  They've never really taken off though.  I'm not sure that's what is featured though. You need a big induction loop for  RFIDs (here's a transparent PayPass card where you can see the copper antenna loop running along the outside of the card)."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,RyGuy997,30,Thu Jun 18 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"That won't be the case by the end of this year. Everyone has slowly been getting replacement cards with chips since about January. It's not chip and pin though, it's chip and signature (apparently we Americans are too stupid to figure out chip and pin)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,eco_was_taken,19,Thu Jun 18 16:52:30 2015 UTC,Chip and signature? Sounds awful. Chip and pin has been standard here for at least a decade or so
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,RyGuy997,8,Thu Jun 18 19:57:09 2015 UTC,"Well, we aren't just signature cards here in the US. Debit cards are chip-less PIN (though many give you the option of running the card through a credit card processor instead). Debit cards make up the overwhelming majority of transactions. I can't find any information on the PIN vs signature rates for debit cards but debit cards make up the bulk of card transactions.  The reasoning the credit card companies and banks give for using Chip and Signature (the notable exception being MasterCard which has been pushing for Chip and Pin) is that lost or stolen cards make up only a tiny portion of credit card fraud. Most credit card fraud is stolen card information (including PIN) written to a counterfeit card. The switch to chip addresses the problem of counterfeit cards containing stolen information on the mag stripe once we finally drop the mag stripe a few years down the line. So if adding the PIN isn't going to make a large dent in credit card fraud they may as well not use it which is easier on consumers.  The credit card companies are also worried about adopting Chip and Pin because Americans usually have more cards than people in other countries so memorizing all those PINs would run the risk (for them) of consumers switching to using fewer cards (I suspect this is the more driving reason behind the decision).  One thing to note is that signature in the US isn't really as big of a hassle as you'd expect. This is because virtually nobody checks the signatures (including the credit card companies unless there is some after the fact dispute that comes up). It was interesting for me that while traveling in Australia and New Zealand that the cashiers would always check the signatures (after some initial confusion and sometimes calling in a manager). Someone actually checking your signature is just so uncommon here. Many people who want more security actually write ""See ID"" instead of their signature but that rarely helps because nobody bothers to read their ""See ID"" message.  So Chip and Signature is dumb but at least we are getting the chip which is the most important part."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,eco_was_taken,3,Thu Jun 18 20:56:25 2015 UTC,Thats likely because in Australia as of August 2014 we can't actually approve purchases with signature anymore. Its ALL pin.  http://www.cnet.com/au/news/australian-credit-cards-boost-security-as-chip-and-pin-deadline-approaches/  Majority of transactions (IIRC ~70% now) in Australia under $100 are all contactless (PayPass/PayWave etc.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,Yogibe,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:45:33 2015 UTC,"Debit cards make up the overwhelming majority of transactions.   Really? I hardly ever use debit because of the cashback I get from my credit cards. Most terminals in Canada are WiFi now, just tap for anything up to $100. Any more you need to use the chip and PIN."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,BikerRay,5,Fri Jun 19 13:30:27 2015 UTC,Do you have swipe and signature now?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,Mr12i,8,Thu Jun 18 17:09:04 2015 UTC,About half of my cards have chips in them now. The chip cards still have mag stripes on them though. The other half are still swipe only (with the exception of my PayPass card which is tap or swipe but doesn't have a chip yet).  I imagine their plan is to keep swipe readers around during the transition then once all cards have a chip in them start phasing them out so only chip and contactless terminals remain.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,eco_was_taken,13,Thu Jun 18 17:16:18 2015 UTC,In europe we still have the magnetic strip (we have used chip for more then a decade). The strip is used when the chip fails. That way you can pay anyway.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,squeezy_bob,4,Thu Jun 18 17:47:39 2015 UTC,"Mostly swipe. Signature is typically on large purchases, shady neighborhood, etc"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,Multiplatinum,3,Thu Jun 18 21:02:38 2015 UTC,Yeah but what you're talking about aren't RFID as is shown in the op pic. What you're talking about are chips on the card that are still physically read by the card reader (they slide the card into the terminal). RFID cards can be read by the terminals without physical contact.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,eco_was_taken,2,Thu Jun 18 22:09:37 2015 UTC,Sure enough it had. I was so excited to say something that I didn't even notice.  Apologies.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,illevator,2,Thu Jun 18 22:18:49 2015 UTC,"The banks make a bigger profit from Signature versus PIN transactions. This is why the banks offer more perks (points, miles, insurance, etc.) to the customer for signing, and why retailers do things to encourage entering your PIN, such as jumping straight to the PIN entry screen and forcing you to hit ""cancel"" to go back to the ""credit/debit"" screen.  Supposedly, signature transactions cost the retailer more because they have a higher rate of fraud. In reality, the extra fees are almost entirely profit for the bank because the actual fraud rate is much lower than the percentage of the fee and the banks usually find some loophole to push the cost of any fraud to the retailer, anyway.  TL;DR: It might be chip-and-PIN, too, but U.S. banks don't promote anything PIN-related because that's not where the money is."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,principledsociopath,7,Thu Jun 18 20:55:20 2015 UTC,"This is almost completely false. Ever since the Dodd Frank act Debit has been regulated to be the same price regardless of whether you sign or use a PIN to process the transaction, with only a few industries (gas stations, etc) not getting regulated rates.  Any difference in price between the two is likely your card processor's fault. Additionally, EMV enabled cards cost 0.15% more per transaction due to EMVCo's licensing fees, and almost every modern EMV card in the US isn't even generating a proper unique code for each transact either, making this upgrade pointless."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,centralbusiness,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:55:14 2015 UTC,"Dodd-Frank regulates certain debit card transactions, not credit cards.  Point-of-sale systems in the US run signature transactions as credit. I've never seen a ""signature debit"" option in my life. Having a third option at checkout would probably be too confusing."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,principledsociopath,3,Fri Jun 19 00:19:06 2015 UTC,"That might explain debit cards (""signature"" and ""PIN"" have traditionally been different networks for them) but credit cards run over the same network regardless of how one's authenticated."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,tmiw,4,Thu Jun 18 21:21:39 2015 UTC,"It's less about the stupidity (yeh I get the sarcasm) but more about the awesomeness of the American payment industry.  Chip and PIN was rolled out first in areas with very high levels of fraud, and very poor telecoms. One of the great thing that EMV (which implements chip and pin) brings is the ability to do an offline authorization. Trust is placed in the combination of a physical token and secret. The offline authorization allows payments to be made in stores with terrible connectivity.   There is also a change in liability. With chip and PIN, the merchant and customer carry liability. With swipe and sign, the issuer or network carry liability. Many large chain stores (being merchants) are not happy with that liability shift, and have fought it."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,lovethebacon,3,Thu Jun 18 19:24:29 2015 UTC,"The merchants have always held the liability, its just with EMV large merchants that don't upgrade can't win chargebacks as often. Small & medium size merchants lose chargebacks 99% of the time, so to them this liability shift really is utterly meaningless, as they already get treated like trash by the issuing banks/brands.  Remember, on a co-branded card (Alaska Airlines, Delta Skymiles, Nordstroms card, etc) Alaska Airlines or whoever the branding partner is gets to decide if you win the chargeback. And if it is anything besides a Walmart or Target, you'll win virtually always."

Leaving my card in the reader the whole time like some technological Neanderthal, and now I'm struggling to get my card back in my wallet so I can take the receipt from the impatient cashier.   Though that still beats the paypass terminals that don't beep but require you to cover the screen with your card. How long do you stand there with your card on the reader before you peek and risk disrupting the transaction? Who even thought turning the beep off was a good idea?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3aalub,Mechakoopa,5,Thu Jun 18 21:04:10 2015 UTC,"The ones built in to the handheld pin pad terminals don't always have lights. Usually at gas stations, convenience stores, drive thru's and food court restaurants. They beep because they don't have lights. Though all the ones at the Shoppers drug stores in my city have the bigger mounted terminals with the tiny screen, no lights and no beep. And they always have the most patronizing ""I don't want to be here"" cashiers working.  Any unit that is a standalone paypass station though, separate from the chip/pin unit, those all have the 4 lights. Like the one at my favourite taco place."

I stopped using Google Wallet because it was just so unreliable whether or not a terminal was actually ready for it. I figure I'll start using it again when the EMV/chip rollout is done at the end of the year. The terminals that need to be upgraded should be by then.

I personally used both a contactless Visa and Apple Pay with Amex there and it worked. But when they turned on their EMV chip card support, their contactless support completely stopped working.  Home Depot staff were full of misinformation too, like contactless only worked at attended checkout lanes and not at self checkout, which I knew to be false.

The box has a scalar horn antenna (the funnel with concentric rings, left) which collects the microwave beam and directs it into a waveguide, a short closed metal pipe. Two small metal pins project into the waveguide from the circuit board; these serve as antennas which convert the microwaves to radio frequency alternating currents. On the circuit board (center), these are amplified by a low noise amplifier, then a local oscillator and mixer convert the block of frequencies to a lower block of frequencies, which are output to a jack on the outside of the box (black objects, right) to which a coaxial cable is connected to carry the signal inside the house"

This last incident was the carbs fault. One cylinder was getting very little fuel, and fuel burns but also lubricates, it blew a 1.5 cm hole in the piston. Also, this bikes aren't really ready for the heat that ethanol creates, and it's impossible to find fuel without at least 10% were I live."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a1jct,gnualmafuerte,6,Tue Jun 16 17:36:38 2015 UTC,I always thought ethanol burned at a lower temp. But... I gather that smaller engines (especially older small engines) don't handle it that well.  There's also the matter that pure ethanol has a flashpoint just above room temperature.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a1jct,GeneralDisorder,7,Tue Jun 16 17:58:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, it burns at a slightly lower temp, but for a longer time, actually heating the engine more. And this old beasts rev up to 16k RPMs, it's a recipe for disaster"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a1jct,gnualmafuerte,4,Tue Jun 16 18:06:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, what happened likely has very little to do with ethanol or whatever minor lubricating properties the fuel has. The problem is that lean combustion conditions burn hotter and more completely, creating a dangerous cycle where an ever-hotter cylinder has worse and worse pre-ignition (knocking, pinging). This concentrates stress on any surface irregularities-- points that are simultaneously being hammered by misplaced and mis-timed detonation and weakened by excessive heat. Then they fail and you get a window in your engine."

Here's the schematic.  The outer surface of that rotor exceeds the speed of sound, and the casing is stationary. There is supposed to be a vacuum between them, but high pressure inside the spinning tube. The centrifuges are so sensitive that a single fingerprint can throw them off balance and break it beyond repair.   Now, as I have understood it the outside of the rotor essentially works like a turbopump like so  The idea is that the rotating the centrifuge will pump the molecules that leak at the top back into the rotor, thus meaning that they don't need a physical contact between rotor and stator ( the bottom is either balanced on a needle or magnetically levitated ).   Now, the catch is that turbo-pumps only work reliably if the pressure is already low, and obviously the top needs some form of magnetic bearing to keep it stable at 90 000 RPM. Thus the seal in between the rotor and the turbopump has to work as some form of vacuum pump, while still being stable enough to stop the turbine from losing its balance, and it should also resist corrosion of gaseous uranium hexafluoride.   Needless to say, the precise details are classified..."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a1jct,gamblingman2,4,Tue Jun 16 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"For those wondering, yes, there is some fuel and oil and such that passes by the rings and cylinder. Normally, they just had a little pipe or vacume to pump it out of the crank case, nice and simple. But because of emission standards and what have you, they can't do that. So they actually pump the gasses that pass by into the engine to be reused. Pretty cool, huh?  Sometimes something goes wrong, like too much carbon buildup or just some other gunk with age. That makes the vacuum pull too much from the crank case, and it starts sucking oil more than it should. Then your car starts to burn oil, and it is black and low in no time.  Airsoft guns also use the same ring expansion system for better seals. When the spring in the gun pushes the piston forward, the piston head has small holes in it that let the air being compressed enter them, and flair the o ring inside out, causing a more firm and complete seal.  I'm rambling, aren't I?"

Why wouldn't the ring float to the top of the groove while the piston is being pushed down thus preventing it to spread (I would think the piston would accelerate down faster than the ring as its surface against the pressure is much larger...)
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a1jct,_hchc,5,Tue Jun 16 19:29:24 2015 UTC,"The piston will not accelerate down faster than the ring, since it is connected to crankshaft which limits how fast the piston can move down.   The piston does not fly down with the force of explosion(and it's not really an explosion, only increases pressure about 5 times). Instead the way it works - the piston tries to hold the high pressure in as long as possible all the while rotating the crankshaft. Actually when the explosion occurs the piston is at top dead center and cannot actually rotate the engine - it is like pushing down on a vertical lever. It needs to hold the pressure until the lever gets more or less horizontal - then it begins to rotate the engine."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a1jct,goeslikestank,6,Tue Jun 16 20:41:30 2015 UTC,"Ignition occurs before top dead center, flame propagation isn't instantaneous. When referring to ignition advance it is always measured in degrees before tdc. Say we advance the timing from 15° to 30° this moves the spark further before tdc thus ""advancing"" timing. There are tons of factors that determine what your ignition should be at any instance. The goal being that your cylinder pressure maxes around 10° atdc."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a1jct,gdub695,2,Tue Jun 16 23:53:07 2015 UTC,"Right, I was trying to ELI5"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a1jct,MisterPooftahburger,4,Wed Jun 17 00:56:04 2015 UTC,"Well there's 3 rings: two rings like you see in the diagram, and an oil ring at the bottom (wavy like a crinkle fry). That one stops most of the oil, then you orient the gaps on your two compression rings opposite each other, to minimize oil loss."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a1jct,gdub695,2,Tue Jun 16 19:42:29 2015 UTC,The rings rotate around the piston. They don't stay where you originally oriented them.

However, it is much more about feel than visual. Visual way if good if you totally screwed up and pushed some pins too high. The way this works is you need to get a locksmith set and pick at the same time you turn. Put pressure on the rotation. At any given time there is only one pin that is blocking the rotation. You feel it as the hardest to push. Push it up till it clicks. But don't overpush. Then feel for the next pin blocking the rotation. Push it up. Do it 2-3 times and the lock opens."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a03c9,wozowski,5,Tue Jun 16 04:30:54 2015 UTC,"I seems odd that the oil pickup immediately splits into two, thereby leaving half the circuit to completely bypass the oil coolers. It's effectively housing more oil than it needs to."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a03c9,MisterPooftahburger,7,Tue Jun 16 09:04:38 2015 UTC,"It is about watts of heat exchange. Someone counted how many watts of heat needed to be dissipated in radiator, build cooling loop with those parameters and made a place where working and cooling loop connect and come to same temperature. That can be done better, but you don't  need to cool exactly the oil you wanna use, just put certain amount of heat out from the system."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a03c9,masuk0,1 point,Tue Jun 16 11:59:56 2015 UTC,Yeah but they could have made the system significantly simpler.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a03c9,MisterPooftahburger,3,Tue Jun 16 13:01:52 2015 UTC,"So much things to be taken into account. Pressure drop in radiator, optimal flow rate and temperature drop/gain in each loop in what temp range radiator will optimally work (radiator works from medium to low temp in this case, from high to low in case of consecutive installation). You can't just tell what is better, that is a complex engineering question."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3a03c9,masuk0,4,Tue Jun 16 13:11:14 2015 UTC,Taking a stab at this. Former engineer for an aerospace cooling equipment manufacturer. There may be a thermostatic valve on the cooler side. This would open once the oil comes up to temp preventing the engine from running on cold oil for too long and causing engine wear. The T allows for one oil pickup and pump and ensures oil is always flowing to the engine regardless of if it is flowing to the cooler or not. We used a bit more complicated system on aircraft but that's the gist of it.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39o752,okaychanged,44,Sat Jun 13 07:45:36 2015 UTC,"It achieves similar internal volume to a cylindrical suppressor without obstructing the pistol's built-in ironsights.  Also, SilencerCo's Osprey (pictured) is clearly designed with a Glock in mind, and matches its cross-section fairly well.  Most pistol suppressors are still cylindrical, and people add special raised sights instead.  Rifle suppressors are much less likely to be anything other than cylindrical, because the ironsights are generally higher, and they are much more likely to have optics mounted anyway."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39o752,Videogamer321,9,Sat Jun 13 13:57:32 2015 UTC,"The issue with that is indexing the groove to the top. Even with the same threading, not all threaded barrels have the same starting point of the threads. I'd say it even differs from barrel to barrel for the same model. So if you make one that indexes correctly on one gun, it won't on the next. The Osprey uses a sort of locking ratchet system to index properly."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39o752,SecondaryLawnWreckin,3,Sat Jun 13 21:20:51 2015 UTC,"Because it's a balancing act between size, weight, and sound suppression. The curvature in these baffles gets the sound waves to bounce around, each bounce slows them and makes them lose energy and therefore less sound produced. A suppressor is just a specialized muffler like those on a vehicle. A firearm without a suppressor is like a car without a muffler. Car manufacturers have the same problem of space vs noise reduction.  And yes, it can be disassembled for cleaning."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,usernametiger,2,Fri Jun 12 15:53:50 2015 UTC,But remember the crank is rotating at thousands of RPMs
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,mr_poppycockmcgee,27,Fri Jun 12 18:04:36 2015 UTC,"Because the pistons are moving really fast and explosions take real time to propagate at that scale, spark plugs are timed to fire at a certain amount ""before top dead center"" such that the compression of the fuel-air mixture allows for the most efficient combustion while also being able to utilize as much of that energy as possible. I think modern engines with computer controlled firing can alter this timing on the fly."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,nogodsorkings1,9,Fri Jun 12 02:37:15 2015 UTC,They can. Older stuff does as well with a vacuum advance built into the distributor.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,Balls_Mahony,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:44:55 2015 UTC,Or on large engines timing advance is linked to the throttle.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,Fapstronaut_TK_421,0,Fri Jun 12 00:58:15 2015 UTC,The faster the engine is spinning the sooner (before top dead center) it will fire.

I noticed in this that the radial engine was going counter clock wise, is this normal? All plane props I've seen have blades that go clock wise. Or is this just a radian engine for something else that needs the motion in a counter clockwise motion?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,kansaskid,6,Fri Jun 12 06:23:27 2015 UTC,I believe the British used to build engines that spin the opposite way from most engines built in the rest of the world. Not sure which is which tho...
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,Whiskonsin,9,Fri Jun 12 08:23:22 2015 UTC,Why does British transportation always have to be the opposite of the rest of the world?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,Hobbycoder,2,Fri Jun 12 09:22:00 2015 UTC,Helicopters tend to be the same. Robbies have the main rotor spinning clockwise while european brands (like Eurocopter) have them going anti-clockwise. Its the first thing you notice when you switch as the initial position on the anti-torque pedals when you first bring the heli into a hover is completely opposite.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,jgur88,8,Fri Jun 12 13:47:42 2015 UTC,What determines the position of the counterweight? From this angle everything seems pretty balanced.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,Zaz1920,5,Thu Jun 11 23:12:54 2015 UTC,I imagine the length of the pistons determine the length of of the whole center weight assembly.  What I want to know is what determines the WEIGHT of the counterweight!
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,AndyJarosz,1 point,Thu Jun 11 23:32:21 2015 UTC,"yeah I know it has to be off-center or else it won't rotate at all, but the pistons all be the same length and therefore weight. I learned a little about the vibrations in my dynamics class recently, but couldn't do the calculations myself. I'm just trying to figure out where the inherent imbalance is."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,Zaz1920,3,Fri Jun 12 00:00:36 2015 UTC,"Since the point where all the crank arms join is offset from the crank shaft, the center of mass of the system rotates around the crank shaft. Take a look for example when the top piston is at the bottom of its stroke, and the lower pistons are at or toward the top of their strokes. The center of mass is now directly below the crank shaft, meaning the counter weight should be 180deg opposed at the top. Helps to visualize if you look at the dynamic parts of the system as a whole rather than focusing on individual components, i.e. relax your focus and ""zoom out"" to see all the pistons moving together as one ""shape"" that rotates."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,theGIRTHQUAKE,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:11:40 2015 UTC,You could find it as the average torque on the drive shaft and then translate that to mass needed to have 0 torque.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,GenOmega,3,Fri Jun 12 13:02:51 2015 UTC,"There's always going to be more force in one direction no matter how balanced an assembly like this is, you need to balance out the impulses of power (each cylinder fire). Notice the counterweight is always lined up with bottom dead center of each cylinder, that's what determines position."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,bengine,1 point,Fri Jun 12 01:25:28 2015 UTC,"There's a video on YouTube about it, not necessarily about rotary engines, but all engines, I think it's on the engineering explained channel, I'll post a link when I get home"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,slaytalera,4,Fri Jun 12 01:27:14 2015 UTC,"Radial, not rotary.  Rotary is something else entirely with triangles and wankels and mazdas and oil consumption."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,EatSleepJeep,2,Fri Jun 12 14:03:47 2015 UTC,"Rotary can also be a radial where the entire crankcase rotates as well as the propeller.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_engine.  However, your point is still valid, the engine in the OP picture above isn't a rotary in either sense."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,Eddles999,2,Fri Jun 12 15:06:49 2015 UTC,Which was such a terrible idea.  The torque effect from that rotating mass was godawful.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,EatSleepJeep,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:08:20 2015 UTC,Absolutely!  Which is why they were quickly abandoned and radial engines developed.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,Eddles999,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:51:54 2015 UTC,It counterweights the mass of all the pistons. They are all connected to the opposite end of the crank and are being accelerated by it. Look at all the pistons and imagine where the combined centre of gravity for them is and how it moves around. Does this make sense?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,lpew,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:25:43 2015 UTC,The counterweight is aligned with the piston at the furthest inward stroke. This centers the weight against the other outward pushing pistons.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,ShutMyBallsInTheDoor,7,Fri Jun 12 00:45:46 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain why these are more popular than, say, a V-6 on an airplane?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,matchstiq,5,Fri Jun 12 05:17:05 2015 UTC,You have to watercool V6. This can be aircooled. Size and weight also.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,39iga5,masuk0,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:28:51 2015 UTC,"Not a V6, but the flat 6 in my plane is air/oil cooled, not water cooled. Most aircraft engines in high performance light singles are flat 6s and very few have water cooling.   And aircraft engines have totally different power requirements than auto engines. They are designed to run at full power for hours on end, at max (or near max) RPM.  Since the prop directly bolts to the crank in most setups, this is between 2400-2700 RPM.  Faster and the prop becomes inefficient due to the tips going supersonic.   Auto engines tend to produce peak power 5-8000 rpm, and are most definitely designed to run that fast for long."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,391sqz,asad137,3,Fri Jun 19 00:51:30 2015 UTC,"The way that I understand piston design is that a wedge/dome shape is the most efficient on a gas engine. Not to be confused with the hemi design since the original is supposed to have been a half sphere and had too much surface area. The wedge shape is said to work a lot better in that it fills the space in the head more uniformly. Because of this, recesses in the piston need to be cutout in order to accommodate the valves since there's usually some valve opening with the piston near or at top-dead center."

Flat-nose semis put your feet at the front of an accident - there's very little barrier between the front of the truck and the driver. An engine in front means that the thing you hit is less likely to go through your body. All else being the same, the flat nose is not as safe in an accident.  It's not necessarily about having an engine in front, it's more that there's anything in front of your body.  Not too long ago, there was a very high instance of broken legs in Formula car drivers, because the feet where at the front of the car, which took the greatest impact in wrecks. They fixed this by making the nose of the car longer."

There is a port on the left (driver) side of the camper that allows you to hook up a 3 inch hose to the septic system from the camper.

Most camper set-ups have two tanks one for the septic from the toilet and another for ""grey water"" which would be from showering and sinks.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,38f7e1,residue69,31,Thu Jun 4 00:19:54 2015 UTC,"Oh I used to be mormon.   What's interesting is that this was built in the early days of mormonism, so one of the rooms was used for meetings (I think). Now a days we have smaller chapels where we meet, and the temples are reserved for special things (like weddings, baptisms for the dead, endowments, sealings, etc).   Because we don't need as many rooms, we've been building mini-temples that have the minimum number of rooms so there's better dispersment around the world.  There's also a room called a celestial room (even in the mini-temples) where you just sit and be quiet. Typically this is after you receive endowments.   Explanations of terms: Baptism for the dead is exactly what it sounds like. When someone dies unbaptized, Mormons (with proper permissions) will do proxy baptisms. They believe they still have to accept the baptism in the afterlife, so it's not like forcing someone into mormonism after death, free will is a pretty important concept in mormonism.   Endowments: Basically a ceremony where you make certain promises and go through rituals. I went through this ceremony, but I won't be answering questions because it's something they hold sacred, so it's frowned upon to talk about it. There's plenty of info online   Sealing: Technically the same as marriage, but applies to adopted kids and such. Basically Mormons believe that families will persist into the after life (in the marriage ceremony, instead of ""till death do you part"", it's ""forever and for all eternity"", but you only get that if you get married in the temple, meaning to another mormon.) The sealing room is where these ceremonies take place. I haven't been to a mormon wedding so I can't comment much on it. No booze though obviously.   The name for the celestial room comes from the Mormon version of heaven. There are multiple ""levels"" of heaven. Celestial is the top level. So in the celestial room, after doing all these religious ceremonies, you are close to heaven, and many report a spiritual feeling.   Also, there's not really a concept of Hell. The lowest heaven is said to be better than earth (no official canon on that I believe). There is ""outer darkness"", but to go there you have to know the true love of God (I think) and turn away. As far as I know, very VERY few people go there. Hitler will go to the lowest level in theory.   Anyway, this is one of the biggest temples built. It's pretty interesting IMO."

The temples are all mindblowingly ornate inside and outside and have a crapton of symbolism and ""hidden"" meaning within the architecture and design but the SLC temple is particularly fancy. It took 40 years to build the damn thing! The architect, Truman O. Agnell was the head honcho architect for many of the church buildings during that time, including several temples. Regardless of my opinion of or standing in the LDS church, the big temples have always impressed me because they're gorgeous and I'm the daughter of an architect and was raised noticing weird shit that was included in the design of pretty buildings. The vast majority of the temples, including those being currently built, are much, much smaller than this one to save money and utilize smaller pieces of land as the church membership has grown in size.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,38f7e1,FrankManic,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:46:16 2015 UTC,"Mostly because the devout members of the church consider certain things like the temple to be very sacred. The more information that's out there about the temples, the higher the risk that someone would mock it or disrespect it. But all temples have an open house before being dedicated once they're first built and I believe anyone who wants to can go inside and do a walk through of most of the spaces within the building. After they dedicate the temple, you can only get in with a temple recommend and you get a temple recommend by living a life that's correct and good based on the rules of the LDS church."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,38f7e1,isysdamn,2,Thu Jun 4 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"That's wild. I wonder what they changed or redesigned? I always assumed that the open house doesn't allow random people to explore around the entire temple so I don't know why you'd let people into a room if you know you're going to redo it after the visitation period for non members is over. I wouldn't even be allowed past the lobby of a functional temple right now because I'm non-practicing and not technically ""temple worthy.""

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,38f7e1,mythology_guy,21,Wed Jun 3 22:10:02 2015 UTC,"That's because Mormon doctrine holds that temples are holy buildings in which someone worthy can spend time with God. Do you also consider it odd and cult-y that you cannot normally enter the Vatican, or the locker room at Soldier Field, or the Pentagon? Temples are special in Mormon doctrine because they are, themselves, holy.  The Church is very clear that a temple recommend isn't set up to promote exclusivity; they outright say they want everyone to prepare themselves for a recommend, and set the bar high to promote cleansing oneself in the eyes of the Lord and the Church. I think in that light you can look at the restrictions as a bar to set for yourself in terms of purifying, rather than getting ""admitted to the secret cloister"" that you'd think of with a cult.  Source: Ex-wife is LDS, never practiced myself. There are many reasons to hate on Mormons, but I can sort of get behind temple recommends because within the context of LDS faith, improving yourself in that way is nice.  (Edit: Spelling.)"

C'mon  I can appreciate their doctrine and all that jazz, but to the uneducated (with respect to the LDS) observer, their customs are pretty odd. No caffeine, the aforementioned temple thing, the missionaries, the fixation with Utah (yes I know there are Mormons all throughout the US, just saying.) I look at Jehovah's Witnesses the same way."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,38f7e1,mythology_guy,14,Thu Jun 4 02:32:41 2015 UTC,"I wasn't comparing at all. I was merely pointing out that you are prohibited from entering many places for many reasons. Theirs just don't make sense to you, and that's fine. You're entitled to that. From you saying ""every Catholic church,"" you seem to have misunderstood the role of a temple to Mormons: a temple is not Sunday church. You go to wards for that, or ""meetingplaces."" Temples are reserved for baptisms, conferring of the priesthood, sealing of marriages, significant events like that. Anybody is welcome at a ward.  Do you look at all Judeo-Christianity ""the same way"" because of some directives in the Old Testament? D&C 89 doesn't say caffeine, because when it was written barely anyone knew what caffeine was; it specifically says ""hot drinks,"" which the Church interprets as coffee and tea. In the time since, we've identified that certain teas have a lot of good properties for you, just like we've figured out that we probably don't have to stone gay people, so many Mormons don't follow certain sections of the Word of Wisdom as rigidly as others. I know many Mormons who can't survive without a morning Red Bull. I've had hot chocolate with Mormons, too.  Look, I'm athiest and with you on criticizing religion when it harms people, but I also have the dissonance to understand that some customs of Mormons actually do work out in your favor and improve yourself -- earlier in D&C 89 ingesting tobacco is forbidden, and I think many people can agree that's healthier than the alternative. I also think it's possible to be athiest and respect someone else's customs without ""looking at them weird,"" unless they're beheading people in public or something. We can all get along, is my point, without calling religions cult-y.  I realize my position will likely be unpopular here, but it shouldn't be."

In my local one, the font is in the centre of the building and can be viewed from the celestial room (the celestial room here is the middle one on the right).  Also, even though is appears to be in the basement, great care is taken so make sure that all our fonts (in both chapels and temples) are built so that the water surface is on the same level as the ground outside because baptism by immersion symbolizes the laying down of our old life (thus under water = in a grave) and the rebirth as a disciple of Jesus (also resurrection).   If you look closely, you'll notice that even though the font in the SLC temple appears to be in the basement, it's actually on the same level as the ground outside in this model too."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,386hk0,cheggg,1 point,Tue Jun 2 12:35:18 2015 UTC,[Serious]What would happen if you pulled the trigger?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,386hk0,catfayce,4,Tue Jun 2 14:24:43 2015 UTC,It would release the hammer therefore striking the firing pin which in then his the primer in the bullet itself igniting the gunpowder inside the bullet and the actual round itself detaches from the brass shell and accelerates forward at an incredible speed delivering freedom.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,386hk0,IanSan5653,2,Tue Jun 2 15:07:52 2015 UTC,"Except that as the bullet is shooting forward, the rifling marks pushes it to the empty side, causing it to fly at an angle and hit the remaining part of the muzzle (forgive me if I get my gun terms wrong), bouncing back and hitting youor a bystander."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,386hk0,satin_rules,3,Tue Jun 2 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"The casing would rupture and result in an explosion, the bullet would not ""shoot"" as your thinking."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,386hk0,shutta,2,Tue Jun 2 17:02:04 2015 UTC,"Quick question, is there a reason the rifling is at this precise angle? Like a long spring? What if it had more loops at a somewhat steeper angle?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,386hk0,satin_rules,2,Tue Jun 2 17:15:03 2015 UTC,There are differences in twist rates between different barrel lengths and calibers in order to achieve different ballistics. It gets very mathematical and i dont do barrel work so that's the best answer i have.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,386hk0,segaudette,2,Tue Jun 2 18:03:18 2015 UTC,"The more ""steep twists"" just means the round would spin at a faster rate. Usually smaller rounds would have a faster spin making it more accurate and larger rounds would have it slower. The reason for the lower spin is since the round weighs so much the fast spin would make it ""flip"" throwing it out of it's trajectory. Sorry I don't have a better explanation. I'm a gun enthusiast, I shoot a 7mm rem mag which is a better fat round."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,386hk0,catfayce,2,Tue Jun 2 20:15:39 2015 UTC,"Assuming everything functions like normal, you'd probably burn the shit out of your hand from the round being fired, and the bullet your probably bounce out of the half barrel and hit you, or something else catastrophic."

Yen was equipping his troops with a locally produced copy of the Thompson sub machine gun, chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge, but was experiencing supply difficulties as his troops' sidearms were 7.63mm calibre C96 handguns.  Yen's solution was to produce a .45 ACP caliber version of the C96, thus standardizing ammunition and making supply logistics easier. Designated Type 17, production on the .45 caliber handgun began in 1929 at the Taiyuan Arsenal and ended in 1931. They are inscribed (in Chinese) 'Type 17' on the left hand side of the gun, and 'Republic Year Eighteen, Made in Shansi' on the right hand side. They were issued (along with Thompson SMGs) to railway guards in the province as defense against bandits and other warlords.""  ~ Wikipedia, because I'm too lazy to type the story myself"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,380zer,Th3_Admiral,14,Mon Jun 1 12:40:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, it allows the bullet to mold into the rifling of the barrel, which gives it the proper spin to stabilize it during flight. This is what makes rifled barrels so much more accurate than smooth bored barrels."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,380zer,Ashanmaril,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:01:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,380zer,Th3_Admiral,5,Mon Jun 1 13:20:27 2015 UTC,"No problem! As bonus info, you can also have rifled bullets that fire out of smooth bore guns. For example, many shotguns have smooth barrels with no rifling, but you can fire rifled slugs that will still spin and stabilize on their own. There are also some guns and cannons that use sabot rounds, which are rounds that are smaller than the barrel but encased in a temporary shell. Once the round leaves the barrel, the sabot discards and the projectile continues on its way. The projectile may have its own fins to provide stabilization, or the sabot may have fit into the barrel's rifling to provide the needed spin."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,380zer,disturbed286,7,Mon Jun 1 16:20:01 2015 UTC,"As has been mentioned, the casing doesn't fire, just the copper (really copper-jacketed) part on the end (the actual bullet).  Even that is just too big for the barrel, so that it engages the rifling in the barrel which causes it to spin--which is what gives bullets their range and accuracy."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,380zer,disturbed286,4,Mon Jun 1 08:35:56 2015 UTC,"Sort of.  The bottom of the casing contains a primer, which is a small disc that, when crushed, sparks the gunpowder, which burns and the expanding gases force the round out of the barrel.  There's a hole between the primer and the powder in the cartridge, but it's not to prevent vacuum.    edit: http://imgur.com/rfGCfgu"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37u0z4,Aederrex,8,Sat May 30 17:55:03 2015 UTC,"There are some suppressors made to reduce velocity, like for example the integral one on the MP5SD, which is designed to allow you to use ammunition that is normally supersonic and slows it down to subsonic levels.  This will obviously reduce the power compared to an unsuppressed weapon.   This would be a rare case however, in many cases adding a suppressor to an existing weapon should give you a slightly (several feet per second) greater velocity because the base of the projectile is under the influence of the propellant gasses for a longer time."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37u0z4,Aeleas,8,Sat May 30 20:28:51 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, suppressors are less useful with supersonic ammunition as there will still be the crack of the sonic boom from the bullet.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37u0z4,IvanThePenetrator,6,Sun May 31 05:11:16 2015 UTC,Yes. They usually look a little more complicated but essentially it's just a series of baffles that trap the sound. It always amazes me that the bullet goes right through without hitting anything internally. Seems crazy to me.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37u0z4,utechie,9,Sun May 31 05:14:08 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be pedantic or anything, but to clarify they slow the expansion of the gases and allows them to cool before they escape the end of the barrel and suppressor combo, which reduces the sound.  Some are also known as ""wet"", because they may use a liquid such as oil or even just water to help aid in the cooling of the gases.    As for not hitting the baffles, well, it may look like there's very little space but there doesn't need to be since when the bullet leaves the barrel, it's going to be going essentially perfectly straight.  The sheer speeds mean even a slightly unstable bullet wouldn't really have enough time to tumble or yaw in such a manner that they'd hit the baffles on the way out.  The tolerances may be quite tight, but there's just not enough time for the bullet to deviate much at all in that extremely short distance."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37u0z4,Aeleas,15,Sat May 30 16:40:42 2015 UTC,Baffled suppressors don't slow bullet speed unless the projectile impacts a baffle. Subsonic ammunition is made to be subsonic rounds loaded light or with heavy projectiles to make them subsonic.   Shooting with supersonic rounds doesn't change the way the suppressor works just you end up hearing the crack of the projectile breaking the sound barrier.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37u0z4,indiefolkfan,3,Sun May 31 03:20:57 2015 UTC,"As others have pointed out, you're completely off base and have no idea how they really work.  Some suppressors actually can increase the velocity of a round, though usually not by any significant margin.  That said, some older and earlier suppressor designs used little rubber gaskets that did slow the bullet down.  This is because the bullet would actually make contact with the gaskets since they had an opening slightly smaller than the bullet itself.  But it wasn't the cooling of the gases that slowed the bullet down, it was the friction and impact with these rubber gaskets, sometimes called wipes.  But perhaps you're confused with the way some integrated suppressors work.  I forget the exact model name, but the model of the MP5 that has an integrated suppressor works to slow down the bullet by bleeding off gas through little holes in the barrel itself.  The purpose of these holes are to give the expanding gases a vent through which they can exit, so that there is less of the gas pushing the bullet down the barrel.  As such, one could use traditional supersonic rounds, but with the reduced pressure bringing them down to subsonic speeds.  But this isn't so much a result of cooling the gas as it is simply giving it a place to go instead of pushing the bullet - the actual cooling of the gas will come after it has left the vent and is allowed to expand and cool.  In other words, the cooling gas doesn't have any effect on the bullet because it's no longer really in contact with it for all intents and purposes.    By your logic, even without a suppressor, the expanding and cooling gas would slow a round down when it leaves the barrel since gases are expanding and cooling when they leave the barrel."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37u0z4,C-C-X-V-I,6,Sun May 31 03:22:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's not really how suppressors work at all. To get subsonic bullet speeds, thereby eliminating the bullet's sonic boom, you need subsonic ammunition. Suppressors don't ""slow"" the bullet down to achieve suppression. Nor does the heat of the gasses leaving the muzzle matter. Suppressors simply reduce muzzle flash and allow the gasses to expand."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37u0z4,JakesGunReviews,2,Thu Jun 4 10:23:12 2015 UTC,"The bullet has the same rotational momentum as the rest of the gun until it leaves the barrel, so you'd have to accelerate the pistol's rotation once the bullet leaves the barrel but before it exits the silencer. That is such a small amount of time it approaches being impossible. If the holes were sized as close as possible and you were able to instantly accelerate the pistol a lot the bullet would still probably just graze the sides of the holes and continue being directed out the suppressor."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37u0z4,C-C-X-V-I,3,Sun May 31 11:07:40 2015 UTC,"Angular momentum of the bullet doesn't matter too much; once the bullet leaves the barrel it'll be traveling in a straight line. If the gun was being spun fast enough, the suppressor could move to the side far in the time between the bullet leaving the barrel and reaching the first washer (don't know the technical term) that it would hit the face of the washer.  I imagine that spin would need to be much much faster than any human could manage, but it wouldn't need to be made instantly."

Best examples would be Saiga conversions:  legal to import in stock config., but once extended magazines or pistol grips, etc., are added, 922(r) comes into play.  Same for assembling an AK from a parts kit, even on a US receiver, since it is made from imported parts and being assembled in a configuration that would not be legal for import."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37lcp8,burnthills,42,Thu May 28 15:10:46 2015 UTC,Couldn't you weigh out a number say 25 and then measure that and divide by 25 for the individual weight then weigh them all and divide by the individual weight for the count.

It is a very cool type of nut and it works very well for our application. I made a cool bronze shaft that pushes out the tube that ships inside of the ball nut so we can install the screw. By the way, this shipping tube feels like it is only .000000001"" longer than the ends of the nut and just sets you up for a ball-bearing spill! The end of my shaft allows me to handle the nut, line it up inside of the machine, and then feed in the screw without any gap for a ball bearing to spill out. So, fortunately I haven't had to count them. Frankly, I would expect problems with longevity if someone forgot just one. Any ball bearing slop would be a problem. Cool picture by the way. I will reference this when explaining these to a noob."

This lets you turn the shaft and the bearing will move forwards and backwards very smoothly.  It's a way to turn rotational motion into linear motion with very little backlash.

Spalling/shaped charges/etc. weren't entirely understood at the time, so making armor to defeat them was even less understood. Hell, the hull it was built on was developed in 1940: The T-34. The T-54/55 was basically an enlarged T-44 (a variant of the T-34) with a far larger gun."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37a4sd,Boxcar_313,5,Tue May 26 17:50:40 2015 UTC,"Absolutely impressed. Ive always been in awe of how much it used to take to design things back in the day. For example, the paper blueprints for an Iowa-class battleship weighed in at around 175 tons."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37a4sd,goooooller,4,Tue May 26 15:09:21 2015 UTC,"So I wanted to know how much an average sheet of blueprint paper weighs, right? So I googled ""weight of sheet of blueprint paper"". The number one result came up in the form of a couple lines from an e-book, that being ""Tariff Information Surveys on the Articles in Paragraph 1- of the Tariff Act of 1913 and Related Articles in Other Paragraphs: Volume 1"" printed January 1, 1921 by the U.S. Government Printing Office. More specifically, the lines (found on page 1366 of the 2341 page volume) were:    There are three weights of the [finished blueprint] paper. The two most common weights are, on the basis of a ream of 500 sheets 17 by 22 inches each, the 17-pound weight, used for mailing purposes, and the 24-pound weight, used for ordinary shop purposes. Also, a 30-pound paper, on the above ream basis, is made for the use of shipyards, construction concerns, and others who do much work in the open air.   So some cursory math later, 175 tons divided by 30 pounds per 500 sheet ream at 2000 pounds per ton yields a little under 6 million sheets of blueprints. Binding each ream would create nearly 12 thousand 17x22 inch volumes."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37a4sd,SNAAAAAKE,6,Tue May 26 23:39:00 2015 UTC,"Since were on the subject of radial engines- anyone know why the master rod isn't just a free articulating attachment point instead of being slaved to one cylinder? If 8/9ths of the connecting rods can rotate relative to it, whats so special about the last one. What is the purpose of the master rod? Why not just have all 9 free to move around? Instead of the master rod, why not just have the centre connecty bit and have all the connecting rods pinned to that?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37a4sd,GillicuttyMcAnus,3,Tue May 26 03:27:29 2015 UTC,"If I'm understanding you right and you're asking why each rod doesn't share a crankshaft journal or have it's  own journal,  I think it's to reduce engine length.   A 9 cylinder radial can be only one piston ""long"" with a master rod,  but if they each shared a pivot point or crankshaft throw, the engine and crank would have to be longer to accommodate all the rods attaching to the same point.   With a master rod,  you can also stack radials so you end up with those 25+ cylinder monsters that are only 4 cylinders deep."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37a4sd,YouMustChill,2,Tue May 26 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"Not quite. (this engine has 2 cranklshaft throws, two master rods, and 16(?) articulated rods) On the master rod, there is a the knuckle plate assembly that all the other articulated rods attach to. Why isn't there a knuckle plates with 9 articulated rods coming out of it?   What I'm asking is why isn't there just a just a knuckle plate attached to the crankshaft that all the other piston connecting rods are attached to? What is the significance of having a fixed master rod that is not free to rotate articulate around the crankshaft (like all the other connecting rods)?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37a4sd,GillicuttyMcAnus,6,Tue May 26 04:12:01 2015 UTC,I believe it's to prevent the knuckle from twisting around the crank.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,37a4sd,SplitsAtoms,2,Tue May 26 09:54:35 2015 UTC,"Makes timing easier, if it just had 9 articulating rods the knuckle plate can go any which way and duck up the timing."

They were lengthened at least once in their lifetimes AND at one point had an entire car deck added.  Granted they are nowhere near as big as that, but I still found it cool.   The seven ships constructed were soon modified to increase vehicle capacity twice. The first was the installation of platform decks or ramps, the seconds saw the ships sliced in half vertically across the beam for the insertion of an 84 foot midsection, which dramatically increased the capacity of the seven ships. Later, five of the seven ships (excluding Queen of Burnaby, and Queen of Nanaimo) were cut horizontally from bow to stern to have a new vehicle deck inserted. As a result, the two ships left without the new car deck were removed from the V class designation to become Burnaby class vessels.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-class_ferry  Edit: Apparently all scrapped now.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,Factorian,3,Sun May 24 23:16:31 2015 UTC,"The challenge on that job was that the shipyard had a system, they got their suppliers to deliver early, and were used to deal with known quantities (pumps, fans, tanks).  We on the other hand were a start-up company in Canada, selling the 1st full-size version of this particular product the company had ever sold (or designed for that matter), and the equipment was going into the lowest deck of the new section... which meant delivery very early on, to be installed as they built the section.   We were used to looser organization, not unknown in a startup.  The shipyard engineers had a different attitude... Our shipyard liason had a military haircut, wore specs that wouldn't have looked out-of-place in Houston Mission Control, and spoke English with the flattest monotone inflection. His previous job was as a consulting engineer in Russian oil refineries. Guy was serious.  I'm a terrible storyteller but will try to drag up some stories... :D"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,IanSan5653,8,Sun May 24 20:32:22 2015 UTC,No - dead simple.  Dutch guys with angle grinders.  The welders had to custom-cut strips of steel to fill the gaps between the (somewhat wobbly) cut in the old part and the (fresh and clean) shipyard section.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,dragonfir731,2,Mon May 25 01:46:05 2015 UTC,"It looks like it was designed with expansion in mind. Notice the edges of the ""cut"" walls are painted. They wouldn't bother doing that if everything was welded, so Im guessing the interior at that seam is bolted together."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,IbanezHand,17,Mon May 25 02:11:34 2015 UTC,This not only shows the process but also that the new section floats by itself (if all the doors are closed).

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,Phunk131,9,Sun May 24 13:52:11 2015 UTC,Ships of this size tend to have the engines fairly far forwards.  As the engines are so enormous they have a serious impact on the centre of gravity.  I expect the engine of this ship is just behind where the cut was made.  Not that it changes your plan; but the more you know!
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,WhiteMaleStraight,4,Sun May 24 14:21:12 2015 UTC,"It's a diesel-electric setup, so the dynamo generators are the furthest fore (two compartments aft of the cut, under the top deck restaurant), with the two propulsion motors in the same room.  Electricity at that high voltage you don't want to run through very many water-tight bulkheads.  One compartment aft of that are the four diesels (just a little forward of the exhaust funnels).  The exhaust funnels run almost straight up, the shortest distance (as they take up a lot of potentially money-making interior room)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,HUNG_AS_FUCK,17,Sun May 24 19:53:39 2015 UTC,Some of them are built so that the front doesn't fall off at all.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,damn_this_is_hard,14,Sun May 24 23:12:46 2015 UTC,"I wonder, did they need to beef up the engines for this?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,kilocharlie12,9,Sun May 24 23:31:52 2015 UTC,"It's not uncommon for ships to be run more slowly than they were designed for, so it's really not an issue. (Look up slow steaming; one of the simplest ways of saving fuel and money in shipping)  And that's all that would result in regards to the engine - a slightly slower ship due to increased drag. You wouldn't add a section long enough to cripple the ship for many structural reasons, as well as seakeeping, before you even get to potential powering issues.  So probably not is the best answer I can give sans data. Ships are subject to vast and comprehensive economic calculations, which in this case would have led to the perfect balance between extra passenger cabin capacity and ship speed, as well as other financial factors affected by adding a section to the ship.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,dogfunky,5,Sun May 24 17:07:50 2015 UTC,"I worked on that retrofit (as an equipment supplier).  No, they didn't upgrade the diesels - in fact I heard that the maximum speed increased because of the increase in hull length.  Counter-intuitive, but that's physics for you.  They did beef up the rudders though."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,timboh,3,Sun May 24 18:06:21 2015 UTC,"The Froude number is so cool. It's a ratio of the ship speed over the speed of the surface ocean gravity wave. When the Froude number is one, you're in the sweet spot of speed and efficiency - the stern is essentially surfing on the crest of the wave created by the bow. The longer the ship, the faster the characteristic velocity of the sweet spot with Froude number = 1."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,oldmangloom,80,Sun May 24 23:24:43 2015 UTC,"It was probably built in sections to begin with, so it's not as big a deal as it would be if the ship was built the old fashioned way. Better get those welds right, though.  Liberty ships in WW2 were the first ships built if prefabricated sections--if a torpedo hit on the weld line the right way the ship would just break open like a double barrel shotgun and sing like a rock.  Welding now is vastly superior."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3737rd,TheWarDoctor,31,Sun May 24 17:43:04 2015 UTC,I think the real problem with the Liberty ships was having the metal transition into the brittle fracture region while in the cold waters of the North Atlantic.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,36x8j6,Aethir300,13,Sat May 23 04:57:54 2015 UTC,The prices go up exponentially so this shell is about $30 but a 12 inch shell is about $120. The other thing to consider is the fallout zone of a big shell. The law requires 75 feet for each inch of the shell. So a 6 inch shell like this needs to be 450 feet away from the audience.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,36u2nd,Zomby_Goast,8,Fri May 22 12:43:29 2015 UTC,"At first I thought that the last pin being in position by default was a mistake, then I realized it was genius because a lock picker would naturally try to lift it, then I thought it was poor design because the default-position pin shouldn't be the last pin, but any before it so that a lock picker would have to move it out of position to get to the next pin  but then it just got too confusing."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,36u2nd,euphonious_aesthetic,22,Fri May 22 10:28:06 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track, but you have a couple of misunderstandings about how lock-picking works.  The first phase of picking a lock is trying to find out information about it, and ""reading"" the heights of the pins to see which ones are higher and which are lower is a pretty basic skill. You're not wrong that having a pin at the set height without a key in the keyway would increase security somewhat, but it wouldn't be much of an obstacle for somebody who has even a little bit of practice.  Conversely, techniques like raking and bumping don't really care about pin height to begin with and would work about as well either way.  The second point is that lockpicking pin-by-pin doesn't always progress from front to back or back to front. A lock-picker works by whatever order they're most comfortable with, which might be to do the easiest pins first to ""get them out of the way"" while they're working on the harder pins, or to do the harder pins first so that they won't have to repeatedly set the easy pins over and over when they screw up the hard pins. It's also pretty common to do the longest pins first to get more working room inside the keyway.  But then that brings me to the point where you have good insight, which is that you'd want to put big pins near the front of the keyway, because that blocks vision into the keyway and also limits the amount of room an attacker has to move their tools around in - if they push one of the long pins too high, it would over-set that pin and force them to start over.  But then again, it's really common to have a pick with a bigger curve on the end specifically to work around really difficult pins like that."

It's also pretty common to do the longest pins first to get more working room inside the keyway.   I could be wrong... but I'm pretty sure the pins have to be picked in the right order? You look for the one that has tension, then you pick it. Find the next one that has tension, pick it. No?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,36u2nd,scorinth,6,Fri May 22 14:25:50 2015 UTC,"You know, you're right. You won't be able to set a pin that doesn't have any tension on it.   I think what I was trying to say is that you search for pins that have tension on them in a particular way, and sometimes you'll have more than one pin with tension, so you have to choose which pin to try to set first.  It's kind of hard to explain, but in my experience - and from discussions with others - your actions while picking a lock are not just executing the attack against the lock, but also learning how the lock works. So, while it's true that there will be one pin with the most tension on it at any time and so the attack that opens the lock will be a progression of setting those pins one after another, the actions that you take while picking should not be thought of as just an execution of that linear sequential attack.  It's rather like playing Battleship. If you knew where your opponent's ships were, it'd be dead simple, but without that knowledge, you have to weigh the attack - sinking ships or setting pins - against the gathering of data.  Actually, I think that's why ""locksport"" is such a satisfying hobby to so many people."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,36u2nd,segaudette,2,Fri May 22 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"There absolutely is. If it was a kwikset brand ""smartkey"" lock, they are exceptionally resistant to picking. Mainly because they are crap. When ever Id had to pick one, if it was the only point of entry, it would just have to be drilled.   There are other deterrents and upgrades, as well.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,36ixov,iAtty,3,Wed May 20 18:28:41 2015 UTC,"Outside gets loaded first, more traction out there. Inside of your tire rarely gets any severe load and heat so its designed to last longer and to clear more water and debris."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,36ixov,EatSleepJeep,2,Wed May 20 02:01:58 2015 UTC,Asymmetric Tread Patterns  An asymmetric pattern is designed to blend the requirements of dry grip and water dispersal/snow traction where the tread pattern changes across the face of the tire. An asymmetric tread pattern usually incorporates larger tread ribs/blocks on the outboard side to increase cornering stability on dry roads by offering greater contact area. This also helps to reduce tread squirm and heat buildup on the outside shoulder. The inboard side usually features smaller independent tread blocks to aid wet and/or winter traction when driving straight ahead. Tires featuring asymmetric tread patterns allow using multiple tire rotation patterns.   http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=180

Even if it did in some way (milk forming interesting patterns during the freezing process, perhaps?), this is obscured by the very rough knife cut.  Pure liquid cut-in-half is almost never interesting."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,36cs9j,cakedestroyer,20,Mon May 18 12:53:52 2015 UTC,"Well, you get to see the sedimentation. I thought it was neat."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,36cs9j,verticalfuzz,61,Mon May 18 13:11:55 2015 UTC,"I wholly disagree.  Milk is not a pure liquid, but rather a colloidal suspension. Slow freezing of many mixtures creates anisotropy where there was previously homogeneity (the root word in homogenized milk!). As ordered ice crystals form, they exclude impurities which would otherwise disrupt the structure. This is why you see the two color regimes in OP's photo. Pretty interesting IMO.  This effect is leveraged in the directional crystalization of silicon boules for wafer and semiconductor manufacturing- molten silicon is cooled top down as the boule is drawn from the melt pool, excluding impurities and resulting in a single contiguous crystal."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,36cs9j,interiot,7,Mon May 18 13:11:45 2015 UTC,"Indeed, milk does have an interesting molecular structure, but the rough knife cut makes any patterns difficult to see.

The only thing we can see is the macroscopic effect evident in the color banding, irrespective of the knife cut.  You can, though, observe their effects on surface tension.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,36cs9j,limbs_,9,Mon May 18 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"I found the answer in a few places around the web:   The water in the milk, 95% forms big chunky ice crystals and they don't want to have the proteins and the fat in them.  The proteins and the fat get squeezed out of the mixture.  They tend to form around this central core of ice.  So because you see all the fat in one place it looks yellow.  If you look where butter comes from, butter comes from milk and it's yellow.  In frozen milk it's all conglomerated in one place and you can actually, physically see it."

Caring for the environment and approaching that in a legal way is one thing. But risking harm to the thing you're trying to protect just to spite the log-cutters is idiotic.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3675ex,Darthbindy,8,Sun May 17 12:11:33 2015 UTC,Any estimate on how long ago this bullet entered the log?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3675ex,Apolik,7,Sat May 16 22:44:22 2015 UTC,It was most likely 20-30 years ago.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3675ex,Darthbindy,9,Sat May 16 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"It looks more recent than that. If the bullet was shot into the trunk 20-30 years ago, then the tree would have grown around it. If you look at the picture there is a distinct tunnel from the bullet entering the trunk. I would think that bullet entered the tree not too long before it was felled."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3675ex,CoolGuy54,4,Sun May 17 00:10:10 2015 UTC,"That's how old the restaurant using the log has been around, so I would assume it was cut at least that long ago."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3675ex,Darthbindy,8,Sun May 17 02:07:08 2015 UTC,"The only place that would have grown around it would be the bark, since the only living part of a tree, is the bark. The wood inside does not grow at all, so any holes in it will not be filled. if there were bark remaining on the tree, you could see if there was a hole in it or not, and thus if the bullet was shot into it recently or not. However, due to the discoloration around the bullet, which is from the oxides and metal leeching out into the wood from the bullet, it shows that the bullet has been there for quite some time (at least 15 years)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3675ex,p4lm3r,3,Sun May 17 00:59:29 2015 UTC,"which is from the oxides and metal leeching out into the wood from the bullet   It looks too much like heat marks to be that. It could be either from the bullet's heating while entering, or from the bullet's cutting (metal against metal => lots of heat)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3675ex,yoyoyo_its_me,1 point,Sun May 17 06:16:34 2015 UTC,"Heat from entering is definitely a possibility, however considering the majority of those bullets is lead (very soft) it probably wouldn't be heat from cutting, considering even when I've accidentally cut 1/4 inch steel nails that were in wood, it didn't leave any sort of heat mark."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3675ex,yoyoyo_its_me,2,Sun May 17 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the discoloured area could be just the compressed wood, it's the same colour as the denser rings all around."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3675ex,yoyoyo_its_me,1 point,Sun May 17 03:27:35 2015 UTC,"It seems a bit darker than any other areas, so I'd doubt it would be just from getting compressed."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35tzop,Fhistleb,1 point,Thu May 14 17:01:05 2015 UTC,"Genetics do have to take effect through some mechanism, though. It seems, in my own experience, that most dental problems are really caused by dehydration+overly-thick mucus (i.e. the symptoms of having one-half the mutations required for Cystic Fibrosis) making your body less efficient at cleaning out biofilms—of which dental plaque is an important one.  Knowing this lets you do something about it: add more soluble fiber to your diet, drink more water, and perhaps start taking a maintenance dose of a mucokinetic/mucolytic like guaifenesin.  All sorts of things got better for me personally when I started doing this—I stopped getting cavities with every dental visit, but also stopped getting constant middle-ear infections/conjunctivitis/digestive problems/a bunch of other things. These all turned out to be due to bacteria having a really easy time of sticking to my insides—which is no longer the case.  (Other interesting fact: soluble fiber—for example, pectin—is also an effective treatment for radiation poisoning, because radiation poisoning actually kills you by making you suddenly systematically prone to bacterial infections.)"

Come to find out the nerve was damaged from the fall all that time and was slowly eroding my tooth away from the inside out."

They left the tips of at least one of the roots in my gums. They didn't sew it up and so I bled for about 2 weeks. It was awful. The other two I had extracted by an oral surgeon who sawed them apart and extracted sliver by sliver, and put a few stitches in my gums after. I healed in up just a couple of days.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35tzop,dougiefresh1233,5,Wed May 13 16:33:31 2015 UTC,Im sure the surgery type made a difference but some of that could've been because of the difference in position.

The purpose of a root canal is actually to 'trick' your body (from realizing the tooth is dead). That bit they are scraping out of the tooth is the nerve. If the tooth were allowed to sit, with a dead nerve, eventually the body may realize the tooth is no longer alive, which for some people leads to a not well understood phenomenon called internal resorption - where your body basically starts dissolving the tooth and its minerals to 'reclaim' them.   This can lead to bone loss, too.   Anyone who was awake when their wisdom teeth were removed can tell you how well anchored teeth are. Might as well re-use the existing anchors if you can"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35tzop,CovingtonLane,22,Wed May 13 20:34:19 2015 UTC,There are so many steps involved that it's often a specialist task.  There are dentists that undergo extra training to focus on root canals and the like - they're called endodontists.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35tzop,somaganjika,41,Wed May 13 16:27:03 2015 UTC,Dentist here.   That's the reason that tooth is getting a root canal. The tooth is infected and the dead nerve/infection spills out the end of the root. Once the root canal is done it can start healing.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35tzop,mdp300,15,Wed May 13 16:49:29 2015 UTC,So there's no harm when you seal the infection under the tooth?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35tzop,Lotronex,25,Wed May 13 17:22:15 2015 UTC,"Nope. At that point, there's no more infection in the tooth constantly reinfection the area, and your immune system can take care of it."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35tzop,AKindChap,15,Thu May 14 05:06:09 2015 UTC,"The root canal procedure itself isn't that bad.  They use local to numb the area, and the procedure itself kills (and removes) the nerve in the affected tooth.  Any pain afterwards comes from the length of the procedure - they're in there with various drills for 25-45 minutes, and they're holding your mouth open the whole time.  Even then, it's not that bad - a few ibuprofen taken right afterwards keeps the pain down to 2 (out of 10) or so.  Most of the pain associated with a root canal comes from the infection that it treats.  That can hurt like a mo-fo, but these days the root canal itself is just annoying.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35tzop,christhelpme,2,Thu May 14 00:10:35 2015 UTC,A. Is all of that done in one sitting? B. Why the metal rods?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35tzop,oblivious_drawguy,5,Thu May 14 01:25:24 2015 UTC,"A.  It can be.  In my case, the decay was fairly advanced, so my dentist referred me to a specialist (endodontist) who did the actual root canal.  The infection was so bad they had to wait for the swelling to go down which meant a 2 week wait (the nerves were destroyed at this point so no pain).  The followup sealed the canals and put a temporary crown on.  Went back to my dentist at that point, they were able to complete pretty much to the step where they created a mold for a crown that had to be shipped out to be cast, another week.  But if your tooth is in fairly good condition, its possible for your dentist to do it all in one sitting. B.  Metal rods may be added if there isn't enough structure left in the tooth to rebuild."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35tzop,slickduck,2,Thu May 14 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"About 2 years ago i had  tooth ache which i ignored. This turned into Pulpitis within a week and caused severe throbbing pain. The dentist offered me 2 choices, pull the tooth or having a root canal. I chose for the root canal and because of the pulpitis anesthetic didn't work. To be honist, it was the best experience ever, once they started the pain of the pulpitis disappeared, didn't feel a thing. Went to the company barbecue that same afternoon."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35tzop,Talkinboutfootball,2,Wed May 13 18:54:03 2015 UTC,Ugh. I've got some jacked up molars that I need to get worked on. Went to the dentist with what I thought was an abscess (never had one before) and they took an xray and confirmed. Gave me some antibiotics for it. But I still need to get a root canal or pull the molar. Root canal costs about 2k. Don't have that or insurance. Probably just have them pull it. Argh.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,itsjh,3,Wed May 13 13:39:48 2015 UTC,"It has two sights, one with a 3x magnifier and one reflex, no magnification, sight. The magnifying one is actually below the carry-handle, sighting through a cutout in the front."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,NoNadir,1 point,Wed May 13 13:46:39 2015 UTC,Is the one on top not inaccurate being so far above the barrel?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,itsjh,2,Wed May 13 14:11:43 2015 UTC,"It's compensated for. The optic is zeroed for say 300m. After that, bullet will impact lower than the dot. Before 300m it'll be slightly above. That's where the iron sights come in."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,TheTallRussian,2,Wed May 13 14:27:14 2015 UTC,"The top one is zeroed to 100m, and you switch to the bottom one after 200m. Only major downside is forcing you to raise your head up to aim at shorter ranges (there's a reason the US Army no longer uses those M16-style carry handle sights)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,NoNadir,1 point,Wed May 13 14:29:54 2015 UTC,Yeah I guessed the zero range.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,NoNadir,1 point,Wed May 13 15:10:33 2015 UTC,Could you explain that last point further?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,guaranic,1 point,Wed May 13 18:01:31 2015 UTC,"It makes you an easier target when firing from behind cover, as more of your body is exposed. If the sights are lower to the bore-axis then you can keep your head down, with only eyes and upwards exposed. Whereas if it's higher you need to bring more of the area below your eyes above the barrel exposing more of your head to anyone looking back from where you're aiming. There are pros though (easier to get a fast cheek weld for quick firing), which benefit the short-range sight."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,NoNadir,19,Wed May 13 18:36:06 2015 UTC,What kind of imaging was used for this pic? It looks like only the plastic is transparent.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,Hambone0326,18,Wed May 13 01:21:11 2015 UTC,transparent plastic. they just made the gun out of a transparent polymer.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,lead-n-steel,4,Wed May 13 01:29:25 2015 UTC,"That'd be a trip to shoot tracers out of at night. I'm sure it'd bring a crowd at the local firing range, too."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,der_zipfelklatscher,4,Sat Jun 13 15:21:34 2015 UTC,"(Also soldiers have complained about the caliber being too small and having very little stopping power.)   It uses the same standard 5,56x45mm NATO round as the American, British, French or almost all other western assault rifles. It was deliberately chosen over 7,62x51mm because it is lighter and allows soldiers to carry more ammo. Naturally the smaller caliber has less stopping power, however this is not a ""flaw"" of the G36."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,SmokeyUnicycle,2,Wed May 13 07:34:01 2015 UTC,The biggest issue with the caliber I've heard is limited penetration against thick building walls like those in the middle east.

The german government is pissed now, because the german military has a lot of them and now they need new weapons. All because of a scam... But what do you expect from a company that produces weapons?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,der_zipfelklatscher,5,Tue May 26 15:50:19 2015 UTC,I'm guessing you take your information from Spiegel online or the like. The G36 passed the tests and met the demands of the German army at the time. Today it is being tested in new scenarios with different demands that were never part of the original specifications. Of course the rifle performs much worse if you apply new standards. Maybe it's not suitable for missions like IFOR but that doesn't mean that H&K developed a bad weapon. Talk to pretty much any soldier and they'll tell you the G36 is a good rifle that doesn't have any more problems than other guns. The whole story is just another example of something being ridiculously blown out of proportion by German media.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,35rtj2,Honkmueller,3,Wed May 13 08:58:51 2015 UTC,You might be right. I just know about this through the news. Good old Tagesschau and stuff.  Thanks for clarifying though.

I'd done tech drawing up to college level (back when we used drawing boards and pencils and shit) so thought I'd give it a go:) IIRC I started with a centre line through the prop to the vertical stabiliser and marked off the frame stations. Then a centre of the wing box and main spar line which I remember was a pain because of the dihedral, and marked off the rib stations. Then I kinda filled it all in with reference to everything else I had. I had time on my hands lol.  Also I was an airframe fitter in an aircraft factory IRL so that helped obviously as I knew what I was looking at. I'm de-cluttering the house and just came across it, I thought it was long lost.

Surprised it would have to be that big. I guess they might want to use a larger driver for a lower frequency sound for attractiveness. A small chirpy tweeter might sound cheap and resemble a back up horn.  That makes me wonder if there is also a small speaker in the back.   And now I wonder if that object is a speaker if it samples a sound relating to the rpm to make it sound better. This would be a similar system in newer cars that reproduce the sound of the engine inside the cabin such as the the Fiesta St with its sound tube and the Audi's that use microphones and the interior sound system to present the engine sound to the driver, or that cheap car on top gear that made your small-displacement 4-cyl sound like a Ferrari inside the cabin."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,34y49e,trainspotting2,1 point,Wed May 6 13:53:47 2015 UTC,I'd guess it's a speaker to play an engine noise or something to avoid low-speed pedestrian collisions.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,34u4co,pirateluke,13,Mon May 4 16:05:00 2015 UTC,Can anyone explain how this works?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,34u4co,whowhatwhenwhere,10,Mon May 4 16:55:36 2015 UTC,Having taken apart my fair share of cassette hubs I can tell you I have no clue. I'm baffled by this design.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,34u4co,reallifedog,9,Mon May 4 17:00:00 2015 UTC,"My guess is that the gray bit is a sprag clutch and this is what transfers motion. Cheap and cheerful design actually, no thrust bearings, no preload.   The only expensive thing is the machining of the outer hub but even that is built up from three separate pieces to make it cheaper."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,34u4co,HAL-42b,7,Mon May 4 17:33:38 2015 UTC,They use star ratchet design

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,34u4co,coachfortner,4,Tue May 5 04:52:56 2015 UTC,Well its an 11 speed cassette body and I would assume its a sprag clutch as there doesnt look to be normal sprung engagement pawles

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,34o39u,SirNoName,1 point,Sun May 3 13:14:55 2015 UTC,"From the museum description: ""The firebox 1 and the fire tubes 2 are surrounded by water, which evaporates due to the heat. The steam collects in the dome 3. The engine driver uses the regulator 4 to let the steam flow into the cylinders, where it puts pressure on the pistons 5. Through the valve 6, the steam gets admitted into the cylinder alternately from the front and from the back and moves the piston back and forth. The used steam then gets through the exhaust-pipe nozzle into the smoke-box 7 and finally leaves through the chimney. This locomotive has a second, switchable cylinder block 8, which drives the cogwheel."""

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,34o39u,vonHindenburg,2,Sun May 3 14:02:35 2015 UTC,"The cutouts on this display are at different depths.  95+% of locomotives had 2 cylinders.  Some had three.  They would be a double expansion engine with the two outer, high pressure cylinders exhausting into a central LP one.  (Or vice versa)  Shay logging locomotives also had 3 in a rack on the side, mounted much more like a modern engine and connected to the wheels by drive shafts and U joints.  Many engines had 4 cylinders.  2 independent sets, driving 2 sets of wheels.  This allowed for longer, articulated locos that could still negotiate curves.  Probably the max was six.  Whether someone ever built one with two, three-cylinder compound engines, or one of the rare triplex locomotives.  One cylinder would not work very well.  The issue is that you have dead spots when the engine is stopped at full extension or retraction.  With a pair of cylinders offset by 90 degrees, there's no spot in the cycle from which the train can't start."

Something that would hold up in a pack and not taste too gross cold after a long day hunting.   The one I had was in the traditional style and the best case scenario. Family farm raised, hormone free grass fed steaks, wild picked mushrooms, unpasteurized hipster cheese, fresh baked crusty rustic bread, and a layer of foi gras just to step it up a little.   It was a fun little dalliance but at the end of the day its still a dense, cold sandwich whos sum of its parts could have made a truly superb and satisfying meal in a slightly different configuration."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,33twjc,jamparke,9,Sat Apr 25 16:21:30 2015 UTC,"Ya, I love this kind of Art. However I have no idea what I'm looking at."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,33twjc,Crud_monkey,20,Sat Apr 25 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"Here goes, sorry it took so long:  As i said this is a 100 meter (120 meter around the toroidal expansion) Spaceship, a Light Cruiser.  Despite it's size, this type is typically seen as the equivalent of a shuttlecraft in Star Trek. Larger ships (800 meters and up) carry it along.  I'll just begin from the top:   The three mushroom shaped devices on top (there are another three at the bottom) are the main weaponry. Called ""Transformcanons"" they work sort of like a Star Trek transporter but beam ammunition. In the PR universe transportation of objects/people like this is extremely difficult  and the Terrans haven't figured it out yet. However, it's no problem to transport things if you don't mind that they explode upon rematerialisation. Hence the use as weapons. Equivalent explosion force: 10 megatons of TNT.  In the center and below the canons are one of the shields, the Prallfeld (uh...percussion shield?) and one of the FTL drives, the Transitiondrive. The percussion shield is designed to stop objects with apparent mass (and not much else). The Transitiondrive is a hyperjump drive, similar to the ones in BSG. It's a secondary FTL drive system installed in most terran ships.  Below that you can, barely, see the ""Transmitter"" room. A transmitter is like a Star Trek transporter except it only works from one device to the next, you need a receiver station.  In the center of the ship is the ship's command center. Below it are the main components of the ships computer network, a bio-positronic system. As the name indicates, it is a hybrid system, consisting of positronic computer nodes (like our regular computers) and a biological plasma component that is artificially created and allows the ship's AI a certain amount of creativity and even personality.  To the left of the command sphere you can see a cylindrical device. This is one of two Linearconverters, the ships main FTL drive system. They allow for a continous FTL flight through a higher dimensional space. Current speed/range: 500.000 times the speed of light in continous use with a maximal range of 30.000 light years, then the converters need to be replaced.  The big black spheres contain the highly pressurized fuel for the ship, usually hydrogen although other fuel is sometimes used.   In the upper right, below one of the spheres, you can see one of the ship's main reactors. The so called Daellian-Reactors work by using Transmitter technology to destabalize matter and then capture the released energy, allowing for direct matter/energy conversion. It's not all that efficient though, around 60% currently. As secondary systems fusion reactors are installed.  Above that same sphere you can see the projector band of the main defensive shield system, the HÜ-schirm. It's sort of complicated, but it mainly works by transmitting all impacting energy/mass into the same higher dimensional space used for FTL. It can still be overloaded though. Additionally, bigger ships have actually a third shield system that is even more powerful. Oh, and all terran ships have stealth system build in that can make them invisible and undetectable (although better sensors can penetrate stealth, think Stargate cloaking devices)  And last but not least: the toroidal expansions modules contain the ship's sublight engines. They are build into modules because as this ship was designed sublight engines were ""used up"" pretty quickly and had to be replaced often. Nowadays progress has been made but the modularity has been kepts to modify the ships easily for different asks. Bigger ships are, in fact, even more modular and can be taken apart and reassembled like a 3D puzzle, allowing for rapid modifications.  I hope this was somehwat interesting and conveyed some of the fascination of the PR universe :)  Sorry again for the massive delay."

I own a Faro scanner and a Leica MS50 scanner/total station combo. We process the data in Faro Scene the use Point Sense in AutoCAD to draft maps and architectural plans from this data. We also supply raw point cloud data to architects and other people for renderings, etc. The equipment and software to do this will cost around 80k (usd) to 100k (usd). You can and sometimes need more expensive scanners but we usually rent those."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,33qsmg,fattiretom,3,Sat Apr 25 11:54:15 2015 UTC,"How would you scan an area that big?  Would you have to setup rails and run the scanner along it?  Or is the scanner intelligent enough to track movements of the scanner itself, thereby allowing you to walk around with it?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,33qsmg,czek,3,Sat Apr 25 13:57:36 2015 UTC,"The scanners rely on knowing where they are, so they can't really be moved about. I think larger areas are just multiple scans lined up with each other."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,33qsmg,WiseOctopus,2,Sat Apr 25 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"You have a lot of scan setups. The scanners take about a million points a second and can do a 360 dome scan in about 15min at a range of 100 to 300 meters (actual specifications vary my manufacturer and site conditions). The scans are tied together either by using traditional surveying methods to determine the precise location of the scanner setup point (few mm accurate) or by setting up targets (spheres and/or reflective targets) that get picked up by the scanner. The scans are tied together in the software by performing a least squares mathematical adjustment with the common targets picked up in the scans. Some software can tie the scans together using just common objects in the scan rather than the targets but that is usually less accurate.   Fun fact... we now have software that can create these 3d computer models from just high res photos. This software tends to work better outside and is not as accurate as a scanner, but the technology is still in its infancy. We use this technique with drones to map/model mines, large landscapes, city buildings, etc. to a few CM accuracy."

I was a bit miffed at first to see that he had omitted the version from the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comics, until I saw the explanation.  I’d completely forgotten that the Nautilus shown attacking London wasn’t supposed to be the original, but a new and improved version.  Interesting too are the reciprocating electric motors.  Are these mentioned in the book?  They appear in several of the versions on the list.  (Even one animation!)  I have an old demonstration model of such a motor that was given to me by my high school physics teacher.  It looks and feels like a miniature steam engine (and fits perfectly in the back of a Lionel flatbed car).  It’s a pity that the physics of the concept just don’t scale.  They’re so wonderfully steampunky."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,339dyr,Pixielo,11,Tue Apr 21 03:02:48 2015 UTC,"there is an artform called millefiori that does this with clay.   basically, imagine you have a log of red clay, and you wrap a sheet of green clay around the outside, forming a green tube with a red center. now roll that tube so it gets thinner. the ""pattern"" of green outside and red inside will remain the same, but it'll get smaller.  Next the artist will cut the tube into segments. Then the artist sticks multiple tubes together (usually slices of the original log but you can also use other logs) and rolls them until they're thin and long. Again, the pattern gets smaller, but remains the same.  the end of the log will be all mushed together, but when the artist slices off the ends, the center of the log will have the pattern.  here's a simple one of a basketball to help illustrate what i'm saying. this artist does the same thing, only they use glass instead of clay."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,EODtechUSMC,18,Sat Apr 18 06:47:31 2015 UTC,"The operating principle behind a semi-automatic rifle and pistol are very similar.  Once the firing pin strikes the primer, causing the explosion (as seen in the video), some of the force used to push the bullet out of the gun is harnessed to push the slide back.  A small clip attached to the slide holds onto the rim of the bullet, pulling it back with the slide.  As the slide slides back, another piece of raised metal on the opposite side of the ejection port causes the brass to be ejected out of the gun.    In semi-automatic rifles, there is usually a ""bleed"" opening further down the barrel which siphons some of expanding gasses from behind the bullet.  These gasses are fed through a gas tube to the bolt, which is then pushed back."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,engineering_diver,1 point,Sat Apr 18 14:20:03 2015 UTC,Right. But the video should show all that you describe.  Nobody should have had to ask after seeing the video.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,inurshadow,2,Sun Apr 19 12:16:03 2015 UTC,"Something is wrong with either this GIF or my understanding: What is preventing the slide from starting to recoil until the bullet leaves the barrel? I know there are a few different mechanisms for this, but I can't see (or at least recognise) any of them in action here."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,CoolGuy54,3,Sat Apr 18 23:37:12 2015 UTC,The bullet leaves at around 1200 fps. For all practical intents and purposes it's similtaneous.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,inurshadow,5,Sun Apr 19 01:52:07 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowback_(firearms)#Delayed_blowback   To remain practical, this system [of blowback operation without any delaying mechanism] is only suitable for firearms using relatively low pressure cartridges. A cartridge with too high a pressure or a slide with too little mass may cause the cartridge case to extract early, causing a separation or rupture. This generally limits blowback pistol designs to calibers less powerful than 9x19mm Parabellum   I'm assuming this is a 9mm glock because it's common and I cam see a trigger safety and it Glock-like to my low-level of handgun knowledge.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock#Operating_mechanism   The Glock 17 is a 9mm short recoil–operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol.[32] The firearm's locking mechanism utilizes a linkless, vertically tilting barrel with a rectangular breech that locks into the ejection port cut-out in the slide. During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide approximately 3 mm (0.12 in) until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension at the base of the barrel then interacts with a tapered locking block integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide. This camming action terminates the barrel's movement while the slide continues back under recoil, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge casing. The slide's uninterrupted rearward movement and counter-recoil cycle are characteristic of the Browning system.[33]   So if I'm right the barrel and slide should be recoiling together a short distance as the bullet moves down the barrel before the barrel tilts down. You can see in this gif they do in fact start recoiling like that for a couple of frames after the bullet exits the barrel, which I'm pretty sure Newtonian physics doesn't allow."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,inurshadow,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:25:39 2015 UTC,"The recoil doesn't begin until after the bullet leaves the barrel of the gun. IIRC the gases escaping the gun cause the recoil, not the bullet itself."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,Kitsyfluff,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:04:52 2015 UTC,"The recoil doesn't begin until after the bullet leaves the barrel of the gun.   This position is inconsistent with basic Newtonian physics. The bullet cannot start moving down the barrel without an equal and opposite force being imparted on something, in this case the bolt face.  There's no reason the slide would start moving after the bullet leaves the barrel that wouldn't also apply (and much more so!) while it was accelerating down the barrel."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,CoolGuy54,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:14:12 2015 UTC,The gun exerts those forces on your arm. The gases cause the barrel to recoil.  Edit: The reaction forces also likely are what force the casing out of the gun.  here's more glocks  1 2
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,Kitsyfluff,1 point,Mon Apr 27 22:33:44 2015 UTC,"The same recoil force is first used to cycle the action, but as the slide slides back it compresses the recoil spring, which transmits the force to the frame, which transmits the force to your hand. It's all the same recoil force matching the bullet, which is significantly greater than the force from the gases.   Look at how much weight of powder versus weight of bullet goes into a handgun, and you'll see that even if the gas is going many times faster than the bullet it will only have a fraction of the momentum (which is more relevant than Kinetic Energy here)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_brake shows that even on the very high velocity (i.e. more powder weight per projectile weight) you're only getting 10-50% recoil reduction, and that's by venting the gases backwards, if the gas is the cause of the recoil then that should cause the weapon to recoil forwards.  Here's an animation of how blowback works with the timing correct: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Firearm_simple_blowback_animation.gif  This is a smaller calibre so the bolt immediately begins to move away from the barrel and extract the cartridge, unlike the Glock where the barrel also recoils a short distance to ensure the case doesn't rupture, but the principle is the same.  Imagine if you're standing on a little toy wagon or cart, and you suddenly start sprinting. It will shoot off in the other direction as you try to run. You're the bullet, it's the barrel & slide, same principle. It doesn't wait until you leap off it to start recoiling.  Check out my Wikipedia link above, it explains it more clearly than I would, all I can do is tell you that I am supremely confident that you'll change your mind if you do a bit of reading on this."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,CoolGuy54,6,Mon Apr 27 22:41:39 2015 UTC,Agreed. Why is the light glistening on the case before the firing pin hits and why is the focus on the target at the end rather than clearing the chamber for the next round?

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,Wyo-Patriot,4,Fri Apr 24 21:35:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about guns, but if you poke the back of a bullet hard enough will it explode?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,xsuitup,14,Sun Apr 19 01:06:10 2015 UTC,"The gunpowder will ignite and the bullet will be ejected from the casing (brass shell that contains the bullet and gun powder). The bullet will go one way and the casing will go the other, but it will not ""explode"" in all directions. Typically, if a bullet goes off without it being fired from a barrel of some sort to concentrate the expanding gasses, then the velocity of the bullet will be fairly low. There are some good youtube videos of fire tests that were done with live rounds. The bullets went off, but didn't go very far. Most of the damage, i think, was from the casing and not the bullet itself as the casing is significantly lighter than the bullet, so it tends to travel a further distance (at a higher velocity). In either case (bullet or casing), the damage will be low. More than a few feet away and there's little to no risk. In most cases, the flying debris can't even penetrate drywall."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,deelowe,2,Sat Apr 18 18:12:08 2015 UTC,Interesting! Thanks for the detailed reply!
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,xsuitup,2,Sat Apr 18 18:16:45 2015 UTC,"No problem. I wish I could find the video now. It was burn testing for fireman training to show it was OK for them to work around burning ammunition. Prior to these tests, fire departments wouldn't attempt to put out burning gun stores and ammunition warehouses due to fear of injury."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,deelowe,4,Sat Apr 18 18:44:12 2015 UTC,"That's exactly how it works!  On the back end of the cartridge you have the primer, which is a small, sensitive explosive contained in a soft metal button. The firing pin is driven forward and crushes the primer, causing the small explosive charge inside to ignite. That small explosion detonates the larger quantity of powder. That larger explosion separates the bullet from the cartridge and sends it down the barrel."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,rhoffman12,2,Sun Apr 19 15:14:53 2015 UTC,So how hard would it have to be pressed exactly?

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,xsuitup,2,Sat Apr 18 20:51:43 2015 UTC,"People have been used .50 Cal MG rounds (similar size to a small banana) as hammers and accidentally hit the primer, causing the round to go off in (and destroy) their hand. Some bigger and more powerful types of ammo like this will rip open the casing if set off outside the chamber of a gun, not just push the bullet out."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,CoolGuy54,2,Sat Apr 18 21:04:43 2015 UTC,Wow. Sounds nasty. I guess that's what you get for using bullets as a hammer.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,330bhk,xsuitup,2,Sun Apr 19 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah don't Google that, or do it yourself.  I've had NCOs fidget by repeatedly smashing blank 5.56 rounds base-first into the asphalt, which made me reasonably nervous, but nothing ever happened. And sometimes a dirty weapon can hit a primer hard enough to dent it but not hard enough to set it off, so I guess it's mostly pretty safe if you're not a complete idiot."

You can take a weapon that's as long as an m-16 ~40 inches, and make it the length of a FAMAS ~30 inches (which is a bullpup weapon like the image the OP posted) without compromising the accuracy of having a longer barrel because it's the same barrel length, just shifted rearward. It's is a really neat design, but it's not without downsides."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,32yukj,SNESChalmers420,0,Sat Apr 18 12:15:27 2015 UTC,Ive read that this is the worst assault rifle ever built.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,32yukj,scufferQPD,13,Fri Apr 17 22:51:23 2015 UTC,"The A1 was poor, stopped a lot, sand was it's enemy, etc etc etc.    It was an excellent base design, the bullpup configuration (trigger in front of firing mechanism) was a real bonus, it makes the rifle smaller for the same length in barrel, perfect for urban and semi code range warfare that the Armed Forces were seeing in the 80s/90s.    The MOD essentially went to Hechler and Koch, threw them a bunch of money and said ""please make our guns better!""    H&K developed the A2, strengthening the firing pin and changing the cocking handle to a design that deflected the ejected cases, amongst other things.    The A3 is a life extending programme that adds accessory rails, foregrip and other stuff.    I've done a lot of work with the SA80/L85, and I can count stoppages on one hand. The size of the weapon is it's biggest selling point, it's so easy to change direction and manoeuvre through tight places whilst still having it up in the aim. In my eyes, the update made this rifle a world class piece of weaponry.    Edit - stood autocorrcet"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,32yukj,BigRedS,8,Sat Apr 18 08:08:04 2015 UTC,"It has its detractors, but there's probably worse. The original rifle was definitely heavily flawed, but lots of people seem very happy with the A2 - I don't think anything changed on the left side for the A2, so I'm not sure which this is from the photo.  The A1 performing really poorly and being generally hated is not without precedent, though. Many people who criticise the L85 for its frequent stoppages compare it to the M16/M4 family, which started life as the M16A1, famed for its stoppages during the Vietnam war."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,32yukj,I_Love_Tall_Women,6,Fri Apr 17 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yes! Mcnamara was the one who pushed for the M16. The one thing that he and his cohorts didn't understand was about the chrome barrel.  They pushed the rifle through without the chrome barrel which caused failure to fire and had to make our soldiers to clean them consistently when using the rifle.  Once it was figured out that a chromed barrel was needed, the M16 was able to do it's job in the jungle."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,32yukj,SNESChalmers420,4,Fri Apr 17 23:31:01 2015 UTC,Its a lot worse than the M16. Ive heard that the bolt could be stopped by squeezing the upper receiver also the mag release is really close to the operators cheek and magazines would fall out when firing. In addition to melting hand guards.  I have a lot of experience with the M16A2/A4 and M4. I really haven't seen them jam much.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,32yukj,specialgray,6,Fri Apr 17 23:20:24 2015 UTC,"I had extensive experience firing both A1 and 2 variants. The A1 was OK, but stoppages were a constant issue. I had everything from loading (usually mitigated with a 'forward assist' karate chop with the left hand on the cocking handle, magazine stoppages (competition shooters swapped to American magazines as they were interchangeable but made to a higher standard with metal at the base instead of plastic. (Also, relieving the springs a little by loading fewer rounds helped so 28 was my standard load) and even a percussion cap falling out and smearing itself round the bolt (not a fault with the rifle, but the ammo). It was accurate though, especially with the SUSAT optical sight and we would shoot at a Fig 11 target (standard man size) at 600m at competition.  Hitting the target at closer ranges was very easy, even for junior soldiers with less range time. The A2 brought better reliability and seemed to jam up less."

All I'll say is that I wasn't a big fan of all the reaching over you had to do in order to cock it and the magazine change could be a bit of a pain, but that's what you get with a bullpup, and the advantages of it being a bullpup make up for the slight inconveniences I think."

So the heat from the barrel melted the hand guard on those occasions. I agree about the reaching over being a pain and it's also not so good if you have better vision with your left eye, as the positioning of the cocking handle doesn't allow you to use it both ways. Which I think you can do with the m16?"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,32yukj,BigRedS,2,Sat Apr 18 00:40:12 2015 UTC,"The M16 equivalent of the A2 was before even the the M16A2 (it just lead to fixed M16A1s) and was in the late '60/early '70s - far earlier in the model's life than the twenty-odd years it took the MoD to get around to dealing with the SA-80 - so you'd need to have some pretty historical experience to remember it at the point in its life I was talking about.  I didn't mean to say the either rifle is better than the other (I'm not in any position to declare that; I've relatively little experience of the SA80A1 and none of the A2 or any M16), just to point out that it's not uncommon for the first version of some military kit that goes on to gain a reputation for its excellence to actually be really rather poor. It's quite hard to realistically replicate warfighting in order to test these things."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3273n0,totallynotfromennis,3,Sat Apr 11 23:54:39 2015 UTC,I don't get why chain timing isn't more of a thing. That belt looks tiny!
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3273n0,time_fo_that,3,Sun Apr 12 01:34:29 2015 UTC,"Well a chain in this motor would be two or three pounds of steel flailing about. It's louder, less efficient, less precise and more expensive than the 3 or 4 ounce rubber belt.  That being said, I agree with you that it's still worth the sacrifice to use timing chains, especially with low-end engines like this. But consumers don't look at expected service intervals when they buy cars, just at MPG."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3273n0,darthchurro,3,Sun Apr 12 02:06:52 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, I believe the timing for this is actually sealed and exposed to oil flow to help dissipate hear and friction, allowing the belt to have a longer service life (at least in theory; I've not seen any data on it or heard of another OEM using such a design)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3273n0,terafunker,1 point,Sun Apr 12 02:49:47 2015 UTC,"I read that, too. I can't believe that it has any huge effect on the life of the belt, though..."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3273n0,darthchurro,2,Sun Apr 12 04:04:25 2015 UTC,"I have no idea, really. It could also just be a step to slightly reduce friction in the hunt for better MPG."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3273n0,terafunker,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"less precise    How is it less precise, serious question here?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3273n0,ZcarJunky,5,Sun Apr 12 23:49:04 2015 UTC,"The momentum of the chain means there's huge forces in it when the engine is at high RPM. When it wraps around a sprocket, the chain slings off and the momentum carries it in an arc, instead of a straight line to the next sprocket. Chains also stretch under stress. Belts are so much lighter (and a couple other properties) that they don't have nearly the same problems.  For an OHV engine like a traditional American V8 timing chains are perfect since there's only like a foot of chain in the whole engine. Motors with overhead camshafts are more of a problem.  Look up the Ford 427 SOHC motor, it's basically the limit of practical timing chain design. In practice, one of the camshafts was often actually advanced a tooth, in comparison to the other cam, to compensate for the chain stretch when the engine was spinning fast. Today we use a different style of tensioner that might have made this engine more... tame or whatever. But it's still a problem."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3273n0,darthchurro,2,Mon Apr 13 00:02:44 2015 UTC,"That is a lot of good information mate thanks. I drive an 1976 280z which has an timing chain which I've replaced in the past due to age and the fact that it was longer than it needed to be. The only upside I can see which chains over belts is they do tend to last longer and don't fail as often. I've personally never experienced or seen a broken timing chain but I have seen plenty of belts break in my day.   As for the 427, I've looked and examined that motor in detail when I was younger. Its a neat design but the chain driving the cams is MILES long which can lead to some serious problems."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,3273n0,ZcarJunky,2,Mon Apr 13 00:36:11 2015 UTC,"The only upside I can see which chains over belts is they do tend to last longer and don't fail as often.   That is the only real upside but it's kind of a big deal. Belts make sense in some motors, but for a daily driver I'd personally always want a chain."

First time I saw a Focus in a dealership which said it had a 1L engine, I thought it was a misprint. I assumed it'd move like it was towing a ton of bricks. But after a while I learned that was not the case. I mean, I started out in a 1.3 litre Ford Ka, then moved to a 1.25L Ford Fiesta, and now a 1L Focus - the car bodies got bigger and the engines got smaller, yet the increases in power negated that somewhat. Not only that, I've seen increased fuel economy too.  It's easy to forget how much car engine technology has improved over the years (my cars being 1996, 2006 and 2014 models respectively). Over 18 years of development, a much smaller, efficient engine can drive a bigger bodied car. It's quite amazing.  It's why I love engineering, I think."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,324zgo,diverdux,78,Fri Apr 10 18:17:25 2015 UTC,More pellets -> heavier load -> lower velocity -> less range and effectiveness  Also happy cakeday.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,324zgo,mdennhardt,14,Sat Apr 11 01:50:12 2015 UTC,"the larger the shot.   This is incorrect.  Gauge is a measurement of how many spherical balls of lead (edit: the diameter of the barrel) can be made out of 1 pound of lead.  Shells also have a shot size though.  Such as the difference between birdshot and buckshot.  Bird shot is much finer and designed to optimize coverage of an area where buck shot needs to be bigger kill a larger animal.  They also have different sizes within those distinctions.  00 000 Buckshot is the largest buck size there is.  There are smaller Buck shots though, that have more shot (pellets) and slightly finer shot"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,324zgo,the_Demongod,13,Fri Apr 10 18:56:38 2015 UTC,"From wikipedia   The gauge of a firearm is a unit of measurement used to express the diameter of the barrel. Gauge is determined from the weight of a solid sphere of lead that will fit the bore of the firearm, and is expressed as the multiplicative inverse of the sphere's weight as a fraction of a pound (e.g., a 1⁄12th pound ball fits a 12-gauge bore). Thus there are twelve 12-gauge balls per pound (etc.). The term is related to the measurement of cannon, which were also measured by the weight of their iron round shot; an 8 pounder would fire an 8 lb (3.6 kg) spherical cast iron ball and had a bore diameter of about 91 mm (3.6 in)."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,324zgo,Aederrex,12,Sat Apr 11 01:03:29 2015 UTC,Interesting design. It looks like the black plastic that holds the pellets is designed to be a bit of an air brake. So that the pellets with a lot of momentum break out of the plastic casing and spread out after leaving the barrel.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,324zgo,roofuskit,6,Fri Apr 10 20:28:04 2015 UTC,"It can be very lethal - NSFL - at very close range, but the issue is penetration depth.  The smaller pellets decelerate very quickly, and the chances are that they might stop before they reach a vital organ when they aren't traveling as a concentrated mass.  Most people consider less than 12 inches of penetration in ballistic gelatin to be insufficient to guarantee a lethal shot on a human sized target.  The HK CAW intended as a military weapon for example was designed with a more powerful shell than a conventional shotgun that was loaded with tungsten shot - more than twice as dense as steel - in order to ensure deep penetration even at long range."

If you wanted to shoot something like a chainsaw you would probably have to use a sabot so it remains aligned with the barrel, since the big saw at the front would touch the barrel as a chainsaw doesn't have a cylindrical body, and so would wobble around inside the launcher. Also it wouldn't fly at all; it would probably end up flying upwards and then spin around in circles or something since it's centre of mass is near the back next to the rocket motor"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,31ukbr,MerchantJeff,10,Wed Apr 8 14:51:33 2015 UTC,"They sometimes leave the end of the previous cargo in the tank to keep them cool, as chilling them down every load is costly and would incur heavy delays.  They normally start to cool down the tank by spraying the outside with cold water, whilst loading a very slow rate this cargo is loaded as liquid but quickly evaporates into gas, this is then either sent back ashore or re condensed onboard. The entire process for cool down to loading can take hours but this would be a 'first time load' after dry dock or something like that.  Otherwise at a normal loading port, loading could commence after a few hours normally, once all paperwork and check-lists have been completed."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,31ukbr,MerchantJeff,4,Wed Apr 8 17:32:11 2015 UTC,"Its sometimes called a 'heel' the cargo would be a puddle, i'm not sure about how much is kept onboard as I have never worked on a gas carrier, i've only really worked on oil tankers.  As the cargo evaporates it cools down the tank, the cargo that is vapour is sometimes used to power the generators onboard or the main engine. So there is no waste in the process."

The tank failed shortly after it was placed in service allowing LNG to escape, forming a vapor cloud that filled the surrounding streets and storm sewer system.

The problem in my mind would be the momentum/ flywheel like effects when increasing or decreasing engine speed.  Ferraris are all about crisp throttle response and all that noise. I'm sure it's negligible since chains are heavy for their size. But id like to see a comparison to a similar sized timing chain or belt equipped motor

The quali engines would last for about 3 laps and fall apart. The BMW M12/13 was famous for making tons of power ~1400HP for qual but would die after. That was out of a 1.5L 4cyl Turbo.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,31s8a9,trainspotting2,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:05:34 2015 UTC,"Jesus yes this needs to happen.  Also the engines are a bit above 800, last year they (Mercedes engines) were in the mid 800s with full ERS power, this year they have added a bit more too, don't know exact values for that but it is around 50ish.  That value is not totally representative though, that's peak power and they will not be using that full on for more than 20-40s per lap. It is hard to pin down exactly how much power the ERS system provides and for how long as although the regulations limit its 160bhp to 33s, there is the extra power provided by the motor driven turbo and there is no limit in the power that can go straight from the turbo to the KERS.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,31lnxd,scorinth,4,Tue Apr 7 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"For all the discussion about what type of pistol this is, I'll try to hit everything that's visible in the animation. See how many you can spot:   Semiautomatic/""self-loading""/""autoloader"" - Every time a round is fired, it automatically loads the next round into the chamber, but won't fire the next round until the trigger is released and squeezed again. Striker-fired - Instead of driving a hammer that hits a separate firing pin, the main spring drives the firing pin - or more properly, ""striker"" - directly. Single-action - Pulling the trigger can only release the hammer or striker, not cock it. If pulling the trigger could cock the hammer or striker, that would be ""double action."" I don't think anybody's made a double-action striker-fired gun, but there's no reason we couldn't... Detachable box magazine fed - Rounds waiting to be fired are held stacked up in a box with a spring pushing them toward the feeding mechanism. The box magazine can be detached and replaced to allow reloading the gun without having to reload the magazine itself. Recoil operated - The energy to cycle the feeding and firing mechanisms comes from the recoil of firing the shot. Short recoil operated - The barrel and slide are locked together when the shot is fired, travel backward a short distance before the barrel unlocks from the slide. The barrel stops while the slide continues backward, ejecting the casing and so on. (For comparison, in a long recoil action, the barrel and slide unlock after they've already moved all the way to the back, not while they're on the way there. Short recoil is far more common.) Tilting barrel - The barrel unlocks from the slide when the rear end drops down, tilting the barrel. When the slide pushes it forward again, the rear end lifts up until it's locked to the slide and the barrel is in line with the sights again.   That's all I can think of at the moment. Let me know if I missed any."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,31lnxd,HaloSeven,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"Didn't Walther make a few versions of the P99 that were something akin to a double action striker fired pistol? Had no hammer and a decocker, could re-cock the striker and re-strike a round with only a trigger pull and without cycling the action/slide. It's been a few years since I've shot the one my father owns, but I'm almost positive they made what you're describing."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,31lnxd,johncfremont,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:52:03 2015 UTC,"Glock handguns are actually neither truly single action or double action; they are ""Glock Safe Action"".  If you look at the animation, the movement of the slide partially resets the striker, but pulling the trigger is what both fully resets and releases it.  Many, but not all, striker fired pistols do the same.  Ironically, despite the fact that a partially precocked striker is closer to a single action system, the fact that it's technically double action (in the sense that the trigger pull performs multiple functions) was a significant contributing factor for law enforcement agencies looking to replace their DA revolvers."

Luke's obvs has an external switch, because Han used it to slice open that Tauntaun, and while I believe it is hinted at (or possibly even explicitly stated) in the EU novels that Han has some low level force ability, it is unlikely that he would have been able to activate  an internal 'force switch' with them at that time.  edit 1: only someone with knowledge of the force, and possibly only someone with knowledge of that particular sabre. I think sometimes they made the 'switches' quite intricate (almost like a puzzle) and in some cases you even needed to devote a minute amount of concentration to keeping the sabre active.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,30mz5g,BelAirBomber,3,Sun Mar 29 17:45:15 2015 UTC,"""The weapon has an integral suppressor which wraps around the barrel. The barrel itself has a series of small ports drilled in the rifling grooves, leading into the suppressor which slows and cools the exhaust gases. The suppressor can be easily removed for storage or maintenance"" Taken from the Wikipedia page hope it helps."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,30mz5g,BelAirBomber,0,Sun Mar 29 23:14:50 2015 UTC,I know barrel length and rifling affects accuracy and projectile velocity. Shorter barrels are less accurate.  I remember an acquaintance worked in a gun shop and couldn't talk a customer out of purchasing a custom short barrel 0.50 cal handgun on account it would break his wrist.  Can that suppressor affect the recoil (versus muzzle lift)?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,30mz5g,BiWinning85,2,Mon Mar 30 00:53:11 2015 UTC,"Not neccessarily the muzzle lift, it actually helps with things like that, but it does limit how much power you can generate in that small barrel.  Longer barrel = more feet per second.  This round has terrible ballistics and struggles to shoot long ranges, has trouble with high winds, and rapidly loses energy.  It is accurate at short ranges."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,30mz5g,BelAirBomber,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:23:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I guess the longer the barrel, the more time the pressurized gases have to impart force on the bullet."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,30mz5g,SeymoreBhutts,1 point,Wed Apr 1 03:44:51 2015 UTC,"That is exactly what happens. There is a limit though, when the barrel length begins to negatively affect the velocity of the bullet. Too long and it starts to impart drag on the projectile and slows it down. Barrel length doesn't inherently have as much to do with accuracy as many think. It is easier to be more accurate with a longer barrel, as you have a longer sight radius when compared to a short barrel, but a short barrel isn't necessarily inaccurate.   A suppressor does help mitigate recoil, as it is slowing down the expanding gasses as they leave the barrel."

Most industrial diamonds are lab-grown and are actually stronger than natural diamonds.   Some of the flaws in natural diamonds make them unsuitable for industrial uses because they are weaker or less conductive.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond#Industrial-grade_diamonds  To quote WIki:   80% of mined diamonds (equal to about 135,000,000 carats (27,000 kg) annually), are unsuitable for use as gemstones, and used industrially.  n addition to mined diamonds, synthetic diamonds found industrial applications almost immediately after their invention in the 1950s; another 570,000,000 carats (114,000 kg) of synthetic diamond is produced annually for industrial use (in 2004; in 2014 it's 4,500,000,000 carats (900,000 kg).   So, 'flawed' natural diamonds are, in fact, used industrially. They make up about 27,000kg per year. However, fully synthetic diamonds used industrially last year was over 900,000kg.   In industrial uses, lab-grown diamonds are used ~40:1 compared to natural diamonds.

It was of 12cm caliber and 1911mm (75.23 in) long, with a 31cm diameter three-piece discarding ring sabot at the waist and four fins at the rear. ( some early model had six fins ) On firing, from the K 5 Glatt smoothbore gun, the ring was discarded and fell about 2km ( 1.25 miles ) in front of the gun, leaving the fin-stabilized projectile to fly to the target. development began in February 1940 and the long-range trials, fired at the Rugenwalde range, gave a maximum range of 151 km ( 93.83 miles )   source  As it is, current APFSDS can penetrate the armor of any battleship ever made.

Noble of the Ordnance Select Committee in 1863 remarked thus in a study on the matter:   ""A 68 pounder smoothbore and a 7 inch Armstrong gun firing 200 lb shot had been fired at 4.5 inch plate backed by 18 inches of teak. The 68 pounders had penetrated the target, while the 200 pounder had made hardly any impression on it. Noble showed that the answer lay in the relative velocity of the two projectiles. The 68 pounder had been moving at 1,425 feet per second when it struck, while the 200 pounder was loafing along at a mere 780 feet per second. On the face of it, the 200 pounder with 156,000 foot-pounds of energy should have out performed the 68 pounder with 96,900, but the low velocity of the heavier projectile allowed the plate to deform and resist the blow, whereas the higher velocity of the 68 lb shot tore through the plate before it could begin to absorb the blow.""

Also since alot of weapons are quite similar in their construction, you will after a while find new weapons are easy simply because you have taken apart several before that work almost the same way.  I have unlocked almost all weapons (Except a few that require alot of credits) and towards the end I finished up just about any new pistol in under 30 minutes, with all achievements except top-3 and champion, and on a few I even got those two achievements within that time.

Quote from that episode:   Renegade Daleks are blobs.  Imperial Daleks are bionic blobs with bits added.  And you can tell that Daleks are into racial purity.  Anyhow, the one lot of Daleks reckon that the other lot of blobs are too different.  They're mutants.  Not pure in their blobbiness! The result? They hate each other's chromosomes."

What do you recommend if I want a sort of 'The best of the Daleks' in this weekend? You mention the episode with a sort of civil war between Daleks, but what episode(s) is that?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zlme0,atvw,3,Fri Mar 20 17:54:49 2015 UTC,"What do you recommend if I want a sort of 'The best of the Daleks' in this weekend?    Genesis of the Daleks is the really obvious one to watch. This should be on any list - if you watch nothing else, watch this. The story details the creation of the Daleks and is generally considered one of the best stories of all time from the classic series.  Remembrance of the Daleks is the one I cited. It's easily the best of all of the Seventh Doctor's stories, the plot is fairly fast-paced and action-packed with lots of explosions and Daleks being blown up. See the clip I linked in my previous comment.  Planet of the Daleks from the Third Doctor era is pretty good. It's a fairly long story but probably the best of the Dalek stories from that era (the Third Doctor did three). Highlights include hovering Daleks, invisible Daleks, frozen Daleks and the Dalek Supreme showing what happens to incompetent underlings when they fail him.  If you have time, consider watching Resurrection of the Daleks (Fifth Doctor). If you can stomach watching episodes in black-and-white, the Dalek Invasion of Earth is pretty good, with some great shots of the Daleks roaming around well-known parts of central London. Or ""The Daleks"" if you really want to go back to the original story that introduced them in the first place - that's quite good too. ""The Chase"" is an amusing romp as the Daleks build their own time machine and chase the Doctor around time and space, but it has a rather light-hearted comedic tone.  In general, Dalek episodes are usually pretty good, but avoid: Day of the Daleks, Destiny of the Daleks, Revelation of the Daleks. Those episodes have weak plots and the Daleks are at their best when they have a strong plot to back them.  In conclusion, I am a huge nerd. Hope this helps!"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,ElwynJ,35,Wed Mar 18 13:33:52 2015 UTC,Guns like the one in the gif are obsolete in a modern navy and haven't been used in decades. You won't see battleships in any remotely modern navy.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,dan4223,9,Wed Mar 18 15:31:57 2015 UTC,so far
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,Parcec,6,Wed Mar 18 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"Nuclear power plants are only found on aircraft carriers and submarines, currently. Neither of which would be an effective use of a railgun.   NPP's aren't used on battleships because we don't have railguns yet. Once we do, they will.   Also, contrary to what you said, submarines are the single best use of a railgun that can exist in the navy."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,nowhereian,12,Wed Mar 18 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"Nuclear power isn't used for battleships because there are no currently commissioned battleships. Railguns don't fix the overlying reasons they were phased out.  Submarines and railguns don't mix. Think about it. Submarines don't run on the surface and haven't in decades. It would be: Surface (or come to PD), shoot weapon, submerge. High induction current, wet weapon. Maybe the gun could fire once before blowing up.   Now, if we brought back nuclear cruisers and destroyers, that would be the way to go."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,nowhereian,11,Wed Mar 18 20:15:03 2015 UTC,"Pop up, open a couple of cargo bay doors. Aim the rail gun. Fire. Close up.    I agree with you, this is a fantastic idea on paper. The problem is literally keeping the weapon dry, and probably corrosion free. There are no problems with current weapons (SLBMs, tomahawks) because their compartments aren't meant to close back up and keep water out. They close back up and fill with water on purpose. You're talking about a door that opens in a wet environment, exposes high current equipment to sea air and surf, then recloses without allowing any water inside. Not to mention, there's probably no access to maintain/clean/reload it without being part of SUBSAFE. That's a whole other headache."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,coolsubmission,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:49:47 2015 UTC,What about the russian Kirov? And the US had nuclear powered cruiser in the navy until 15 years ago.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,nowhereian,3,Wed Mar 18 22:19:52 2015 UTC,"The US had quite a few nuclear cruisers. The USS Long Beach was the first, in the late 50s, followed by the California and Virginia class cruisers. 8 total, I think.   Admittedly, I know almost nothing about the Russian Navy, except their nuclear power program is/was one of the most dangerous things you could do with your life. I'm not sure if this is still true. They saved weight by cutting back on their shielding!"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,nowhereian,5,Wed Mar 18 20:23:13 2015 UTC,"No reason really, except it would be redundant. The planes are the carrier's weapons."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,jimfixeditforme,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:44:06 2015 UTC,You can't shoot over the horizon or attack as an artillery piece with rail guns/metal rods though..
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,ShadowRam,1 point,Thu Mar 19 01:35:37 2015 UTC,1) You replied to a comment that is 3 months old.  2) The projectile would be affected by gravity and drop over the horizon regardless if its initial velocity was created by powder/rails or someone with a really strong arm.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,jimfixeditforme,0,Sat Jun 27 00:43:04 2015 UTC,Whoops. Sorted by top..  Problem is rail guns work on kinetic energy alone so you might well have limitations on range- if you rely on a parabolic trajectory (I.e. a turning projectile) to get over the horizon you'll have lost a huge amount of kinetic energy to air resistance.  Good for shooting down missiles and incoming small attack craft though..
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,bitpeak,13,Sat Jun 27 01:23:50 2015 UTC,Thats what I thought as well but its just the way the cut out of the gun is. Not sure why the artist chose that weird cut out shape
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,DoubleBassPlease,7,Sat Jun 27 01:29:03 2015 UTC,"Nope, hidden behind part of the cut out."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,Cacafuego2,5,Wed Mar 18 13:11:45 2015 UTC,"If you zoom in really close (I'm using RES), you can see that the cut-out is just overlapping the shell as it is pushed behind it."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,avian_gator,4,Wed Mar 18 16:20:16 2015 UTC,Can anyone explain what the green and yellow parts are and why they aren't together like normal shells?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,Giacomo_iron_chef,32,Thu Mar 19 02:44:02 2015 UTC,"The green part is the actual shell, the yellow part are bags of gunpowder. By not using a metallic casing for the powder you eliminate the need to deal with spent casings.   There is no need for a one piece cartridge in a fixed gun mount like this anyway, and it makes manufacturing cheaper and easier."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,alcoslushies,14,Wed Mar 18 18:35:04 2015 UTC,"You can vary the charge to change the range of the shell.  With this you now have more variables (firing angle, shell velocity) under control to hit targets."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,Giacomo_iron_chef,0,Wed Mar 18 13:19:11 2015 UTC,I'd have thought they just aim it up or down though
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,alcoslushies,7,Wed Mar 18 13:31:50 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you may want to aim it up to get plenty of arc but you don't want it to hit too far away, so you use less charge to keep the velocity down.  This comes at a cost of accuracy as the shell spends a lot of time in transit, during which the target may move or the atmospheric conditions could change.  Alternatively, you may want to hit something further away but reduce arc by using more charge, which increases accuracy (less time in transit to target).  Basically, in ballistics, you eventually start losing range if you aim too high up or too far down, assuming a constant muzzle velocity.  Being able to adjust muzzle velocity allows you to customize the ballistic trajectory more than you could with just angle.  I also guess that they may not always want to use a full charge to increase life of the barrel.  In a war like WWII, you could not afford downtime on the main weapon of your fast battleships."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,meltingdiamond,3,Wed Mar 18 13:44:46 2015 UTC,"Oooooh, that's true. Thanks for the perspective :)"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,Lemus89,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:33:00 2015 UTC,You forgot to mention that with control of both elevation and muzzle velocity the gun can fire twice and have both shots land in the same place at the same time by changing the time of flight. It could take up to two minutes for the shell to land and the reload time is 30 seconds.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2zg9uw,OneEyedCheshire,1 point,Wed Mar 18 22:44:01 2015 UTC,pretty sure i saw a land based artillery piece that its party trick was being able to shoot 5 or 6 shots in a row to land at the same time and just destroy everything in the target zone

Half the shell has been removed to reveal the internal morphological relationships between the lungs, abdominal muscles and skeletal elements. (A) Illustration of the abdominal muscles and lungs of T. carolina. The paired transverse abdominis (TA) muscles wrap around the posterior portion of the lungs and produce exhalation by compressing the lungs as they contract. The cupshaped oblique abdominis (OA) muscles actively produce inhalation as they flatten and expand the inguinal flank postero-ventero-laterally. (B) Photograph of the skeleton with limbs and neck fully extended. Because the shell contains a fixed volume, the lungs can be filled with air when the head and limbs are protracted. (C) Air can be forced out of the lungs when the limbs and head are retracted into the shell. Our recordings show that when T. carolina is in this fully retracted position, some air remains in the lungs and breathing is possible with the use of the abdominal muscles."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z8dfb,newfunk,14,Mon Mar 16 21:52:34 2015 UTC,I think the fact that it's cut in half would mean the shell would just fall out
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z8dfb,Doublestack2376,3,Mon Mar 16 15:48:38 2015 UTC,It's not cut completely in half.  It looks closer to around 1/3 so that the shells are still held in place.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z8dfb,mrmax1984,3,Mon Mar 16 15:58:10 2015 UTC,I just knew by the red shirt and buckled jeans.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z8dfb,Cohacq,7,Tue Mar 17 02:26:59 2015 UTC,There's one bit I've never understood. How does the shell come loose from the bolt and fall out? There doesn't seem to be a lever or anything pushing it out. How does this bit work?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z8dfb,mrmax1984,23,Mon Mar 16 17:21:15 2015 UTC,"When a cartridge is loaded, two things have happened:   The cartridge end is compressing the ejector, which is a small pin in the face of the bolt that is typically being pushed out by a spring. This spring is now in compression, and wants to push the cartridge forward from the bolt-face. Imagine like a second firing pin, only that it touches the outer edge of the case(near the rim), and goes inside the bolt when compressed. The extractor(a simple claw/hook) has grasped onto the rim of the shell case, and is clamped on to it fairly hard through its own spring tension.   What this means is that once the action is cycled(whether semi-automatic or manual), after the case clears the chamber completely, there is nothing holding back the ejector spring. Thus, the ejector pops out of the bolt, pushing the now-free shell case away from the bolt. Since the extractor is hooked on to the right side of the case, this is the direction it will fly towards.  Here is an image of an AR-15 style bolt. The bit on the left is the extractor, and the pin opposite of it is the ejector. When you chamber a round in this type of rifle, the extractor(top-left) snaps over the cartridge rim, and the ejector(bottom-right) gets compressed into the bolt.  They work together in a sort of push-pull action, which results in spent shells being extracted and ejected in a fairly uniform fashion. If the ejector pin or its spring is broken, the shell wouldn't fly away. It would just sit there, requiring you to clear it away manually. Conversely, if the extractor was broken, then the shell case would be stuck inside the chamber, requiring you to use a ramrod through the barrel to clear the spent shell.  TL;DR; Watch this video from the Department of Defense instead! The magic starts around the 2:00 mark."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z8dfb,Axle01,1 point,Tue Mar 17 00:08:51 2015 UTC,There's a little thing called the extractor that hooks onto the rim of the shell and pulls it back. It eventually pulls it free of the chamber where it can flip out sideways.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z8dfb,Schrodingers_Cthulu,6,Tue Mar 17 01:12:12 2015 UTC,Honest question: Why are there still pellets in the dummy shells? Why not just empty shells? I'm assuming the part that makes them dummies is that they don't have any gunpowder in them.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z8dfb,XA36,12,Mon Mar 16 19:05:20 2015 UTC,Its for weight. A shell that is too light may not load properly.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z8dfb,blamb211,3,Mon Mar 16 18:17:53 2015 UTC,"You have a small plastic cup or 'wad' that seals the gasses and pushes out the shot as a single mass.

This only works if there are no other natural air vents into the mine. I believe there is- or was- a coal mine burning in the states somewhere. There was no good way of putting the fire out, so they just let it burn."

I'm also imagining the possibilities for datacenter space. I have no doubt that OP has, in addition to his NARA neighbors, data neighbors. Limestone is pretty badass at absorbing heat and in the datacenter game, heat is your biggest enemy. You need to move less heat in a nice, dark underground environment with limestone walls.  Honestly, you made me look into it to see if I can rent a cage in there somewhere. Nice link."

Over the next century heat from the trains raised the temperature of the surrounding geology and now on the hottest days of the summer the hottest parts of the Central Line reach temperatures above 45ºC."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z6qhf,keithb,1 point,Mon Mar 16 07:57:13 2015 UTC,"No shit? That's fascinating. In the limestone datacenters I've heard of, the stone acts as a ""shock absorber"" and evens out the temperature on a graph over time. The heat does have to go somewhere. That sounds like the behavior of clay; what's the soil like in London?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z6qhf,lachryma,2,Mon Mar 16 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"Sure, there's a huge thermal mass in the stone so it can act as a sink or a source, for a while, anyway. Note that it took a century for this effect to take hold in the tube.   London sits mostly over clay, chalk and sand. Is limestone that much better a conductor of heat than clay?"

Limestone is very porous, which is apparently key (and that makes sense).  Most of my experience is based on that. He calls limestone an excellent rejector of heat.

A fleet of micro copters in the air around the flight path would provide the controlling software with real time air flow information to exactly predict the trajectory.  The container would have control fins that allow precise steering to keep the container upright and on trajectory to the receiving trebuchet.  The receiver is smart enough to reach out and catch the car container.  It's a trebuchet in reverse, an electric brake, recapturing much of the kinetic energy invested by the throwing arm.    As a passenger it'd feel like sitting in your car as it rides up an elevator, then a transition to weightlessness, (which might limit the market a bit), and a resumption of gravity that feels like a descending stopping elevator.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z0rhh,Fidodo,4,Sat Mar 14 18:49:07 2015 UTC,the upper deck doesn't seem to be attached to any sort of suspension cables   Of course it is.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z0rhh,Legate_Rick,4,Sun Mar 15 00:46:00 2015 UTC,"Most likely, the structure would have to be reinforced quite significantly though. With enough money you could alter and strengthen the structure without really changing the outside or historical profile and if we are talking 50-100 years into the future it wouldn't be terribly presumptive to think they might have materials capable of supporting longer spans with less bracing or supports.  Likely you would have a system of columns coming down into the original structure tough and then add or strengthen the cable lines.   It's not that the structure they have depicted wouldn't be possible in the future it would just never be designed that way, not for any practical reasons at least."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2z0rhh,spriggig,3,Sat Mar 14 21:05:38 2015 UTC,"A little different, but they're doing something very similar on the Bayonne Bridge in NJ/NY.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ye1uv,soloxplorer,5,Mon Mar 9 12:40:58 2015 UTC,"You're partially correct.  The delay in sound is caused by the distance from the camera to the plane, not because the bullets are super-sonic.  You can tell this since in the video you see the flashes of the impact before you hear the impacts occur.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ye1uv,meltingdiamond,2,Mon Mar 9 21:56:07 2015 UTC,"Like all things russian, the Soviet version is bigger."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ye1uv,actioninja,2,Wed Mar 11 00:54:03 2015 UTC,"Actually fires a slightly shorter bullet, and is smaller than the GAU-8.  This is what a GAU-8 looks like, the ammo drum is integrated.  The gun itself is 2.85 m, or about 9'3"".   It fires a 30 x 173mm cartridge which looks like this.  I couldn't find a similar comparison image, but this is what the GSh-6-30 looks like mounted to a MIG-27.  It's total gun length is almost exactly 2m, which is around 6'6"".  It fires a 30 x 165mm cartridge, which, I once again couldn't find a good image with something for scale, looks like this.  The Russian cartridge is only a couple mm shorter, where the 165 is the one on the far left, while the 173 is the red tipped one to the left.  The actual whole misconception of Russian weaponry being bigger comes largely from the AK-47 having a large cartridge due to it being designed before 5.56 dominated assault rifle cartridges, and Russian bombs being massive.  Russian ammunition actually really isn't all that bigger.  It's just slightly different sizing from NATO ammunition.  The AK-47 is what really sets the whole ""big boolet"" idea.  It was designed in 1945, when 7.62 chambered rifles still reigned supreme.  The rifle it replaced was the Mosin-Nagant, which was also chambered in 7.62, but a different cartridge type.  Even the US was using 7.62 chambered rifles, as their current service rifle at the time was the M14. However, when the AR-10 (the 7.62 version of the AR platform) was not performing as they liked, as it was too heavy, a new cartridge was developed, what would become 5.56 NATO.  The new rifle was dubbed the AR-15, and entered service in 1962 as the M16.  This new cartridge was shown to be more effective.  It was lighter, faster, more accurate, and had greater stopping power.  The Russian military took notice, and a new rifle was designed.  It was essentially just the AK-47, but it fired 5.45 instead of the older 7.62.  5.45 was a Russian response to 5.56 NATO.  In a bizarre coincidence, it entered service in 1974, giving it the designation AK-74.  The superiority of the smaller cartridge for assault rifles led to the AK-74 actually being more common the Russian military now than the AKM, which is the modern variant of the AK-47.  Despite the military realizing the effectiveness of a smaller caliber, a massive amount of AK-47 and AK-47 like rifles were still produced.  They were, and still are extremely cheap to make, and very reliable.  The ammunition they shoot is cheap, and they can be found almost everywhere.  They are a really iconic weapon, and are very famously known as Russian.  It's kind of strange that the AK-47 is still so popular in modern times when the AK-74 is better in almost all aspects.  Russian bombs being a lot bigger is easier to explain.  They just didn't have the same guidance and missile technology as the US.  It was vastly inferior, so rather than make smaller, more precise bombs, they just made huge ones that only had to hit near their target.  EDIT: small error with reversed numbers fixed."

The knees alone are supposed to operate by two pistons that rotate a gear back and forth; thus making the ""shins"" swing forward.  Problem 1:  Is that gear supposed to turn once weight is on it? If so, how? Quadraped motion requires that at least two legs be up in the air at any one time; unless it's standing still.  That means that two gears are taking the entire weight of the AT-AT's when in motion.   So... What the hell is moving those pistons? Even hydraulic drives would struggle with a few hundred tons of armoured personnel carrier.  But even worse, Problem 2:  Really think about those gears. If they are supposed to turn when the pistons move, then those pistons can't change position.  IoI « there's the position of the pistons and the gear when the foot is planted.  \o\  « that's how it would look if one moved down, the other one moved up, and they pivoted forward.

So the knee can move forwards and back, but it's limited by the length of the teeth on the piston.   // «» \ like this.  But it's below a gear, meaning when the top gear moves the thigh from || to \, the Pistons become reoriented from || to \ also.

The pistons aren't powered by the springs, those are just dampeners. The piston bodies are probably prevented from moving in two dimensions (side-to-side and front-to-back) but allowed to float up and down the leg, to reduce shock loads. The silly thing is the thigh and lower leg are mechanically coupled at the knee though, so those springs aren't going to dampen shit for the passengers. They might give the pistons longer life though I guess..."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2y2qjg,jroth005,1 point,Fri Mar 6 14:37:40 2015 UTC,"See I thought they were dampeners at first, but they're just free floating springs. Nothing to prevent the massive springs from pushing downward at full force.   If they were dampeners, would there not be something to keep the springs from constantly pushing on the piston?   A bracket to absorb the spring's force, our at least contain the spring so that it doesn't fight the piston. Even car suspension springs have a bracket to keep them under pressure even in the air.  If there was something to keep those springs from constantly pushing on the Pistons, I would agree. But they are constantly exerting a not-insignificant force.   Therefore, I have to assume they are there as party of what drives the Pistons.  Like a mechanical back up in case of hydraulic failure; that way if the hydraulics fail, the legs don't just collapse.  That, or the artist is an artist, not an engineer.  Also: what the Hell is with the ankle motors? Why? Those feet are massive. A simple joint in the ankles would allow them to pivot. Their mass and the hinge being centered would ensure they stay parallel with the ground when moving.  And TOE PISTONS? WHY? WHY MUST YOU FORCE THE TOES FLAT WITH GIANT PISTONS? WHY?

It's not capable of keeping several hundred tons from shifting around.   All dynamic stability would do is calculate where to keep the legs to minimize constant shifting of weight.   But those legs are still several hundred tons, and in the movies they aren't moving so fast that they ever have more than two up at any one time.   Those legs take several seconds per movement, so a dynamic stability system would be very limited in is ability to change much.  Even among they have dynamic stability, they rebels still manage to trip one at least.  So... what exactly are you on about?"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2y2qjg,Volpethrope,0,Fri Mar 6 22:07:44 2015 UTC,No one would ever make a walking vehicle this large. They're ridiculously impractical compared to something with treads or wheels. The most realistic superheavy vehicles would be more like the Warhammer 40k Baneblades or aerial gunships/transports. The ATAT would be a colossal waste of resources and development time.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2y2qjg,PandemicSoul,4,Fri Mar 6 06:21:21 2015 UTC,"Well... it depends.  If you're building a transport for a single planet, with consistent gravity, yeah.  But treads grow in weight twice as fast as they grow in size. As do the drive shafts, wheels, bearings, etc. That's why the largest earth movers don't use treads, but wheels.   The Baneblades are literally impossible. Even if they could move, they'd only move at fractions of a foot per hour. They would be giant targets, and ones with lots of failure and maintenance points.  Their inertia alone would require potentially billions of Newton/meters of torque to overcome.  Legs could be made with fewer moving parts which helps deal with their weight, and if you want a vehicle that can handle a variety of environments and terrains, a walking transport isn't a bad idea."

The standard Baneblade weighs like seven times as much as an M1 Abrams, and is around twice the size in each dimension. There's just no need for a land vehicle that large.  Intriguingly, the Lexicanum lists the Baneblade as having an on-road speed of 25kph. I'm curious as to exactly what roads would support a 350 ton tank without turning into chunky gravel, but there it is."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xpdvn,aitigie,67,Mon Mar 2 20:59:40 2015 UTC,"This is an eCVT (very different from most CVTs) with the addition of a two speed gear reduction and AWD.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xpdvn,IWetMyselfForYou,1 point,Tue Mar 3 01:07:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think its limited to hybrid, it just requires a (fairly low power) electric motor with smart speed control to set the ratio.  Imagine the case where you have a hybrid, but the electric motor isn't spinning at all; you can still drive at any speed using the gas engine and trans as normal (and in fact this is actually done in real world conditions - if the batteries are near dead and you need full power, you can't divert any torque to the electric gen / motor, but also don't want to further drain them).  No reason I see that you couldn't just do away with the electrical side of the dual input, have it effectively fixed in place."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xpdvn,CarVac,3,Tue Mar 3 00:00:19 2015 UTC,"To clarify on what you called a ""dual mode CVT"". The middle planetary is basically a 2-speed automatic which allows the car to go faster without over-RPM'ing the motors.  Also, both motors act as both drive motors and generators at different times. You can't make a firm distinction without specifying the conditions."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xpdvn,CarVac,6,Tue Mar 3 03:53:16 2015 UTC,"The leftmost planetary gearset is the Power Split Device, the core of the hybrid system.  The next one is one that just changes the gear ratio between two fixed ratios. It increases the top speed of the car.  Then you have the a concentric shaft going to a gear out the side to the front wheels, and then it goes to the center differential. Of some sort."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xpdvn,jrlp,3,Tue Mar 3 00:34:40 2015 UTC,"To a point, yes. Transmission shafts are polished to varying degrees. Rough surfaces are stress risers.

The building was sold off for redevelopment into a new complex including leisure facilities and shops, but also retaining some offices and studios which the BBC will lease back.

It's a combination of the tendency of the BBC to move away from in-house facilities, which started in the 90s, and their relocation from London to MediaCityUK in Salford.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,karpathian,7,Fri Apr 24 06:54:01 2015 UTC,It looks like a tv satellite dish from the 80s.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,Erik_TL,1 point,Sat Feb 28 19:14:41 2015 UTC,I was wondering if it was a placeholder for the real system.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,Jedi_Outcast,-2,Sat Feb 28 22:01:40 2015 UTC,I'm assuming it is. I like to think I have some idea of how planes are designed and I see no reason to place that kind of dish there. It is not like a commercial plane where there is a dish at the very nose of the plane so that it can pan up/down (weather radar) as the one in the picture would only be able to pan up which would not be very helpful. Thus I am assuming that the dish in the picture is a place holder like you said.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,Erik_TL,1 point,Sun Mar 1 02:05:37 2015 UTC,"This dish point only up because it's used to communicate via a satellite to the operator. The nose is bulbous to allow the dish to track the communications satellite. The global hawk is two generations behind what's just starting to fly.   The new stuff performs the same task, just that it can be over your house within the hour. Oh, and monitor your entire towns population in real time for days."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,Bfeezey,0,Sun Mar 1 03:46:54 2015 UTC,"I understand that but surely there are more efficient ways to connect with GPS sattelites than having a massive dish. For example, commercial planes all have GPS and they do not use that kind of dish to connect with satellites."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,Erik_TL,1 point,Sun Mar 1 06:11:11 2015 UTC,It's not GPS.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,elektronisk,-1,Sun Mar 1 08:34:27 2015 UTC,My point remains nonetheless.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,Erik_TL,2,Sun Mar 1 09:24:53 2015 UTC,"You wrote that there is no reason to think the dish is really there because 1. You see no reason to have that kind of dish there, pointing up. 2. GPS antennas don't need to be that big.  But its not GPS, and Bfeezy already suggested it was for satellite relay to the operator. If you try looking at the diagram it helpfully lists it as a SATCOM antenna, like Bfeezy said. How else would you create a worldwide high-bandwidth link?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,elektronisk,-1,Sun Mar 1 10:45:26 2015 UTC,"(dusts off tinfoil hat) It's most likely a classified and high-tech GPS tracking device, either for flight or for missile guidance. That dome shape is an impractical design to just house a DirecTV dish in. Either that, or it could just be some really tiny dude piloting the plane in his cockpit. Who knows?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,totallynotfromennis,5,Sat Feb 28 20:08:14 2015 UTC,"A dish on the outside would essentially be like a big ass speedbreak and it would probably make it a whole lot easier to be spotted on a radar.  If they need a dish, that's a very good way to house it"

It broke constantly in various expensive and time consuming ways.  It's also super fussy about having many backup communication lines before takeoff, making it tricky to even get off the ground on an island in the middle of nowhere.  It's neat watching the flight path, though... perfect circles and turns, even spirals in a perfect column when descending."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,Bfeezey,1 point,Sat Feb 28 18:14:11 2015 UTC,Early drones had a huge record of losses compared to flight hours. Each unit only lasted an average of a few flights per loss. These new drones cost millions each. They won't be ordered without a decent amount of flight time between losses. Meaning they are designed for ideal conditions. Next ten drones can operate in most conditions with acceptable losses.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,3rdweal,1 point,Sat Feb 28 16:07:16 2015 UTC,"Think of it as ""Rods from God lite"".  Imagine a tungsten rod 1 inch in diameter, 1 foot long weighing around 6 lbs, if it reaches a velocity of say 2,000 feet per second (easily possible from 60,000 feet, the Tallboy reached over 1,000 feet per second dropped from less than a third of that height) it would have a kinetic energy at impact of 400,000 ft lbs, easily enough to slice through the armor of any modern tank like a hot knife through butter.  For a 3000 lb payload, the Global Hawk could carry 500 such projectiles - that's a lot of ""fire""power that would come out of nowhere, a potentially very effective weapon with virtually no launch signature."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,3rdweal,2,Sat Feb 28 17:15:03 2015 UTC,"Considering modern munitions like JDAM have an accuracy of 7-13 meters   Excalibur has no propulsion and when tested in combat in 2007 had ""92% of rounds falling within 4 metres (13 ft) of the target"", almost guaranteed to hit something the size of a tank first time around.  You're right about moving targets being more of a challenge, but electronics are getting better and better, and remember this is simply dropped, not fired at several thousand feet per second like Excalibur, so you can get away with less hardened guidance.   what about soft targets like personnel   General Dynamics are working on a Kinetic Energy Rods Payload - pdf link - warhead for MLRS that is basically a submunition round that releases many small rods spreading over a wide area to deal with soft targets.  These packages would obviously be heavier than the single rods I proposed earlier but Global Hawk would still be able to carry say 10 x 300 lb area rounds.  Again these would rely purely on the kinetic energy of the subprojectiles imparted by gravity and as an added benefit, there would be no danger of UXO."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,3rdweal,0,Sat Feb 28 17:36:52 2015 UTC,"The top armor of a tank isn't particularly thick, let's say our hypothetical 6 lb projectile split into 6 separate rods just before impact to cover a wider area, this would increase the hit probabilty enough to guarantee at least one hit.  Obviously for a moving target GPS alone would useless and you would need to be tracking the target with a laser, unless the projectile itself has its own IR or optical seeker, something which we are seeing on smaller and smaller munitions these days.   Maybe a .50 cal size projectile traveling at its terminal velocity? Which if I recall correctly a bullet that is coming straight down to earth doesn't do a whole lot of damage   A bullet fired up that comes down tumbling, perhaps not, but the analogy you should be looking at is the Lazy Dog - even from low altitudes, they could be more effective than walking up to someone and shooting them in the face with a 1911.  This from a half ounce projectile, imagine 10,000 such projectiles raining down as a single package from 60,000 feet that bursts at an altitude of a couple of thousand feet and saturates an area with the equivalent of heavy macine gun fire..."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xgnq7,3rdweal,0,Sat Feb 28 18:31:32 2015 UTC,"My interest in the field is not professional.   What would the deceleration be from 6 lbs to 1lb?   There would be no deceleration per se, but the subprojectile now has one sixth of the kinetic energy, we're now at about 70,000 ft lbs - this is about six times the kinetic energy of a 50 caliber rifle at the muzzle, for a hardened penetrator it could still be sufficient to go through the thin top armor of a tank.   So how come they do not use the lazy dog anymore?   There is a modern equivalent, the Passive Attack Weapon.  In general though I would say that small bomblets as cluster munitions are more effective, they spread fragments in all directions and are more likely to have an incendiary effect and can also be mixed with mines that deny access to the target area - however as we see with the GD MLRS development, the push towards leaving a ""clean"" battlefield with reduced danger of UXO is again making this sort of weapon viable."

Audi would go on to win the 2011 Le Mans with their one remaining R18."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xbdjq,RatBustard,1 point,Fri Feb 27 21:40:53 2015 UTC,it was (may have changed since) a press area for photos. I don't think an off that significant was ever expected there. it was lucky no one was injured or killed.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2xbdjq,eidetic,2,Sat Feb 28 01:28:14 2015 UTC,"Often the most spectacular looking crashes where you think it'd be impossible to walk away from are survivable precisely because they look so horrible.  This is Robert Kubica's crash at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix.  While he suffered some injuries, they were limited to a slight concussion and a sprained ankle, which is extremely impressive given the violence of the crash.  But as I said, what makes these crashes look so horrific is precisely what helps keep the driver safe.  All those pieces coming off the car help to dissipate the energy and keep that energy from being transferred to the driver. It's the crashes where the car rigidly remains more intact that can be the worst.  Take Dale Earnhardt Sr's crash for example.  On the surface of things, it may not look too bad.  But unfortunately, a lot of energy was transferred to his body, and he died from it (and possibly in part because he refused to wear a HANS device - the Head And Neck Support device - which is now mandatory in just about every higher level racing series.  The device basically acts to prevent the head from snapping around too much.  I don't know what the consensus is today on whether it would have saved his life, but he did die from a basilar skull fracture, an injury the device is meant to prevent against).    Then there are the more well known crumple zones, which act almost like springs (albeit ones that don't bounce back), in order to dampen an impact by compressing the parts which spreads the impact out over a greater distance and over a longer duration of time.  Now, there are of course also parts of the safety structures that are designed to be rigid, in order to prevent the car from completely crumpling around, and crushing, the driver (and in some cases, to prevent penetration of objects into the cockpit of the car).   But basically, whenever possible, everything outside of the immediate safety cell of the cockpit is, and again this is whenever possible, designed to either break away or crumple in order to dissipate energy.  And while it may look horrific, it very often means the car is doing exactly what it's supposed to in such a situation."

Nuclear submarines typically don't do this because their seawater intakes are located about 3/4 the way down the hull and can easily become clogged with silt or sand.  Seawolf and Halibut had ""ocean engineering"" modifications for their special ops missions that included the installation of ""skegs"" (skid legs) that allowed them to rest on the bottom while keeping the hull and the seawater intakes clear of the bottom.  During a storm, Seawolf's skegs dug into the sand, and her seawater intakes got clogged.  The boat didn't come unstuck until they did an emergency blow, and if that hadn't worked, they would have scuttled the boat."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wzet3,whibbler,77,Tue Feb 24 12:36:15 2015 UTC,"This is my attempt at a reasonably accurate internal configuration view of Putin's enigmatic spy sub.  Normal submarines are essentially cylindrical. But to dive really deep making the hull spherical can be stronger. So whilst the Losharik looks like a regular cigar shaped submarine on the outside, it is actually made up of multiple titanium orbs hidden within a streamlined casing. That's how it gets its name, which is from a puppet horse in Russia which is made out of beads on rope.  Satellite imagery analysis reveals that there are 7 circular orbs inside the hull for the crew to live in. So even though the submarine isn't small, the living space will be tiny.   Obviously there's no real way of knowing the arrangement inside the spheres, although we can make reasonable guesses as to the general arrangement. See descriptions on illustration.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wzet3,Lightspeedius,29,Tue Feb 24 12:38:59 2015 UTC,But to dive really deep making the hull spherical can be stronger.   So the space between the orbs and the outer hull would be flooded to equalise pressure on the outer hull? Or do the orbs somehow provide support for the outer hull? Or am I just showing off my ignorance?

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wwumj,RoundyRoundy,10,Mon Feb 23 21:50:19 2015 UTC,In case anyone else was wondering about compressibility...
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wwumj,RmJack,5,Tue Feb 24 06:05:23 2015 UTC,"That's a damn interesting read.   ""Test flights revealed problems initially believed to be tail flutter. During high-speed flight approaching Mach 0.68, especially during dives, the aircraft's tail would begin to shake violently and the nose would tuck under, steepening the dive. Once caught in this dive, the fighter would enter a high-speed compressibility stall and the controls would lock up, leaving the pilot no option but to bail out (if possible) or remain with the aircraft until it got down to denser air, where he might have a chance to pull out. During a test flight in May 1941, USAAC Major Signa Gilkey managed to stay with a YP-38 in a compressibility lockup, riding it out until he recovered gradually using elevator trim.[19] Lockheed engineers were very concerned at this limitation but first had to concentrate on filling the current order of aircraft. In June 1941, the Army Air Corps was renamed the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF), and a total of 65 Lightnings were finished for the service by September 1941 with more on the way for the USAAF, the Royal Air Force (RAF), and the Free French Air Force operating from England.  By November 1941, many of the initial assembly-line challenges had been met, which freed up time for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had a few ideas for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded servo tabs on the elevator trailing edge; tabs that were designed to aid the pilot when control yoke forces rose over 30 pounds-force (130 N), as would be expected in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot's actions. The expert test pilot, 43-year-old[32] Ralph Virden, was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow, and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft, underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about 3,500 ft (1,000 m) during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that servo tabs were not the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the Army Air Forces personnel were sure it was flutter and ordered Lockheed to look more closely at the tail.  In 1941 flutter was a familiar engineering problem related to a too-flexible tail, but the P-38's empennage was completely skinned in aluminum[N 2] rather than fabric and was quite rigid. At no time did the P-38 suffer from true flutter.[33] To prove a point, one elevator and its vertical stabilizers were skinned with metal 63% thicker than standard, but the increase in rigidity made no difference in vibration. Army Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth B. Wolfe (head of Army Production Engineering) asked Lockheed to try external mass balances above and below the elevator, though the P-38 already had large mass balances elegantly placed within each vertical stabilizer. Various configurations of external mass balances were equipped, and dangerously steep test flights were flown to document their performance. Explaining to Wolfe in Report No. 2414, Kelly Johnson wrote ""the violence of the vibration was unchanged and the diving tendency was naturally the same for all conditions.""[34] The external mass balances did not help at all. Nonetheless, at Wolfe's insistence, the additional external balances were a feature of every P-38 built from then on.[35]  P-38 pilot training manual compressibility chart shows speed limit vs. altitude. After months of pushing NACA to provide Mach 0.75 wind tunnel speeds (and finally succeeding), the compressibility problem was revealed to be the center of lift moving back toward the tail when in high-speed airflow. The compressibility problem was solved by changing the geometry of the wing's underside when diving in order to keep lift within bounds of the top of the wing. In February 1943, quick-acting dive flaps were tried and proven by Lockheed test pilots. The dive flaps were installed outboard of the engine nacelles, and in action they extended downward 35° in 1.5 seconds. The flaps did not act as a speed brake; they affected the center of pressure distribution in a way that retained the wing's lift.[36]  Late in 1943, a few hundred dive flap field modification kits were assembled to give North African, European and Pacific P-38s a chance to withstand compressibility and expand their combat tactics. Unfortunately, these crucial flaps did not always reach their destination. In March 1944, 200 dive flap kits intended for European Theater of Operations (ETO) P-38Js were destroyed in a mistaken identification incident in which an RAF fighter shot down the Douglas C-54 Skymaster (mistaking it for an Fw 200) taking the shipment to England. Back in Burbank, P-38Js coming off the assembly line in spring 1944 were towed out to the tarmac and modified in the open air. The flaps were finally incorporated into the production line in June 1944 on the last 210 P-38Js. Despite testing having proved the dive flaps effective in improving tactical maneuvers, a 14-month delay in production limited their implementation, with only the final 50% of all Lightnings built having the dive flaps installed as an assembly-line sequence.[37]  Johnson later recalled:  I broke an ulcer over compressibility on the P-38 because we flew into a speed range where no one had ever been before, and we had difficulty convincing people that it wasn't the funny-looking airplane itself, but a fundamental physical problem. We found out what happened when the Lightning shed its tail and we worked during the whole war to get 15 more kn [28 km/h] of speed out of the P-38. We saw compressibility as a brick wall for a long time. Then we learned how to get through it.[38]"""

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wi860,goldenrod,11,Fri Feb 20 10:32:42 2015 UTC,"Those are the fuel tanks, bro, opened up to show the inside.  This is the orbital payload, and even 3/5ths of that is another rocket, so I'm not sure if that actually counts."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,d416,11,Thu Feb 19 17:47:40 2015 UTC,I want this lens...one with both it's halves however.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,KW160,7,Thu Feb 19 18:52:17 2015 UTC,Some assembly required though.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,soloxplorer,-1,Thu Feb 19 19:30:09 2015 UTC,"No, you want an OEM lens.  Been there, done that.  Images aren't as good, feel isn't right, just not the same.  I would choose a used OEM over a new Tamron (and have several times)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,pasaroanth,7,Thu Feb 19 21:41:45 2015 UTC,"Nah, I completely disagree. It really is your opinion to which lens you prefer, but often using the Canon 70-200 2.8 and owning a Tamron 70-200 2.8 I would say that I am more than happy with the purchase. The images are pretty similar and unless you're pixel peeping and the Tamron can do almost everything the Canon can (few exceptions) for a much cheaper price."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,Vynjak,8,Thu Feb 19 23:12:22 2015 UTC,"Never used Canon so I can't comment, I'm a Nikon guy.  I've used several Tamron lenses and never had a wonderful experience.  Yes, they're get the job done, but the fit and finish leaves something to be desired.  I don't buy lenses for a year of use, I buy them for a lifetime.  I've had several Tamrons sound gritty upon zooming and focusing after less than 12 months and I don't use them in very harsh conditions.  I'll stick with the lenses made by the manufacturer of my camera, but to each his own."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,pasaroanth,2,Thu Feb 19 23:29:50 2015 UTC,"I'm with this guy all the way, but some second source lenses are great as well.  Check out the Tokina 11-16 if you get a chance (and shoot DX)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,AdShea,2,Fri Feb 20 01:42:35 2015 UTC,"I would have agreed with you 2-3 years ago, but sigma and tamron have upped their build quality in many of their lens offerings.  The Sigma art series is fantastic and you really have to look at images side by side to tell any difference between the OEM lenses.  The tamron 24-70 2.8 VCis a great example of their build quality, being released a couple years ago.  Sigmas 85mm 1.4 is really good and it's build is better than canons (canons focus rings are shit)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,albinoyoungn,2,Fri Feb 20 05:57:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I have the Tamron 24-70 and couldn't be happier. If this 15-30 is of similar build quality and IQ, then it's a no-brainer."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,KW160,3,Fri Feb 20 13:12:24 2015 UTC,Almost all early reviews actually conclude the build quality is even better than the SP 24-70... which is great to begin with!
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,mxma1,2,Fri Feb 20 18:46:22 2015 UTC,If I didn't already have the Nikon 16-35 F/4 I'd buy this lens really quick.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,albinoyoungn,2,Fri Feb 20 19:23:59 2015 UTC,Like a non-retail white-box? This lens literally started shipping two weeks ago. Where would you even get what you're describing?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,KW160,3,Fri Feb 20 00:53:57 2015 UTC,Can someone explain how having so much glass in there improves the image? seems counter intuitive to me.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,random_human_on_redd,12,Thu Feb 19 21:15:23 2015 UTC,"They help to focus and flatten the image so that it can be both sharp and have minimal distortion, ala fish eyeing. Im guessing the glass is balanced together to get a mostly perfectly flat color profile, and the sensor is probably sensitive enough to account for any light lost to the thickness of the glass. Most photographers do color tweaking and stuff in post.    Also i am a super scrub when it comes to this stuff so take what i say with a grain of salt"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,Mattfornow,2,Thu Feb 19 22:10:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand that the glass is there to improve the image it just seems that the more lenses the light goes through the more room for distortion etc.. Anyways I suppose I was more remarking on it than anything"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,random_human_on_redd,9,Fri Feb 20 00:53:23 2015 UTC,"This is true and really good lenses will have less glass, which brings the benefit of higher luminosity. That tends to be extremely technically challenging though and such lenses usually cost prohibitively much because of that."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,Verfassungsschutz,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:21:30 2015 UTC,"Wide angle fast lenses always have more complicated lens designs due to the rectilinear nature of a non-fish eye lens.  Less glass is fine on lenses in the 50mm range since distortion isn't as big of a deal as vignetting or CA.  With the quality of glass that is available to even 3rd party manufacturers like tamron and sigma, they can go kind of nuts with these designs and not worry about breaking too many laws of physics."

Less glass is fine on lenses in the 50mm range since distortion isn't as big of a deal as vignetting or CA.   I'd say that a lens shorter than 40mm, without a retrofocus design, isn't physically possible on an average full-frame SLR is a much more significant factor for  the increase of glass than the optical abberrations."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,C0R4x,1 point,Fri Feb 20 12:32:01 2015 UTC,"This is true and really good lenses will have less glass, which brings the benefit of higher luminosity.   Considering what's currently considered one of the best 50mm lenses you can buy (zeiss otus 55mm f/1.4), and seeing it has 12 lens elements, your information may be true for older lenses, but current advancements in AR coatings and the like have made the light-loss less significant compared to the gains that can be made aberration-correction wise."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,C0R4x,6,Fri Feb 20 12:42:15 2015 UTC,"the amount of light lost passing though lenses isn't very much, but it is noticeable in cinematography where different lenses with different amounts of glass are used for a scene and stitched together. So apertures on lenses specifically made for video are usually marked with t-stops which take in account light loss unlike f-stops which just refer to the diameter of the aperture."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,isamri,2,Fri Feb 20 01:24:19 2015 UTC,"The secret to avoid losing light transmission  is lens coatings, before lens coatings were invented lenses were limited to very simple designs, thus less image quality (especially distortion and CA). Also more complex design allows for faster aperture, so the minimum loss you get in light is gained over by wider apertures. So you end up on the positive side.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_coating"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,magical_midget,1 point,Fri Feb 20 07:25:59 2015 UTC,the more lenses the light goes through the more room for distortion   The lenses are designed so that the distortion one makes is countered by the distortion another one makes.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,meltingdiamond,1 point,Fri Feb 20 08:36:17 2015 UTC,"A single lens does this. You need more lens elements to counter that. There are some more types of distortion that can (and will) occur, for instance the fish-eye type distortion.  On top of that, it is a short lens (15mm is quite short). The focal distance (which is that number in mm) gives you the distance of the center of the lens to the plane of focus (or, the sensor). 15mm is shorter than SLR cameras allow, since 15mm away from the sensor, you're in the middle of the mirror box, so there can not physically be a piece of glass there. Which means you have to add glass to artificially ""lengthen"" the lens (an inverted telephoto configuration).   Having much glass in a lens was generally considered a bad thing, because more glass means more dispersion, so less light reaching the sensor/film. However, advancements in anti-reflective coatings and better quality glass have made this problem smaller and smaller."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wg8mo,C0R4x,1 point,Fri Feb 20 12:29:52 2015 UTC,"One way it was explained to me that made sense is each element/group was intentionally added to ""fix"" something. This is a very ELI5 explanation, obviously not scientific. But imagine 1 group handling chromatic aberration, another fixing distortion, another ghosting so on so forth. Again this is waaay over simplified, but that is one reason why more elements can be helpful."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2wcz4f,Nmilne23,2,Thu Feb 19 17:09:41 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking. If you ran a band saw down the middle, you'd probably shatter some of the lenses.  Also, it looks like none of the logo is missing. How thin was the saw blade? Or, did they cut up two cameras so they could fit it back together and have the original width?"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2w7ck9,kirk0007,7,Tue Feb 17 22:33:31 2015 UTC,"caterpillar drive   Was it actually thing?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamic_drive   The film adaptation of The Hunt for Red October popularized the magnetohydrodynamic drive as a ""caterpillar drive"" for submarines, an undetectable ""silent drive"" intended to achieve stealth in submarine warfare. In reality, the current traveling through the water would create gases and noise, and the magnetic fields would induce a detectable magnetic signature. In the novel from which the movie was adapted, the caterpillar was a pumpjet.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_October_(submarine)   In reality, a variant of the magnetohydrodynamic drive stated in the film has been tested, but proved too inefficient and cumbersome to be used as an effective means of a propulsion system on a submarine. This type of propulsion system also would not be enclosed in a duct/pipe (as depicted in the film). A pump jet would be more efficient, but not enough for a submarine of that size."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2w0yop,Dat_Bokeh,3,Mon Feb 16 00:52:43 2015 UTC,That's alot of empty space in this MF camera.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2w0yop,SlowTurn,7,Mon Feb 16 02:22:19 2015 UTC,I believe this is mostly a side effect of the camera being set up to use 645 lenses designed for film. The image circle of actual 645 film is much larger than the digital 645 sensor. To use the same lenses the flange focal distance from the lens mount to the sensor (or film) has to be the same. This results in a bigger camera front-to-back than would be necessary if the digital 645 system was designed from scratch with a smaller lens mount.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2w0yop,CarVac,2,Mon Feb 16 03:07:30 2015 UTC,"The question is more about the space behind the sensor, not in front of it.   It seems to be sized similarly to a 645 film back, but there's no reason for that since it's not like you can remove it and put a real film back on."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2w0yop,grendel_x86,2,Mon Feb 16 17:10:36 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of that is cooling. Those sensors get really warm. My Leaf backs (CCD, not CMOS)actually have fans on them. After a bit of shooting, they crank up really loudly.   You also have to consider the massive processing needed to move the data, and interpret the image.   The 'back' section is still smaller then my leaf back though."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2w0yop,CarVac,2,Mon Feb 16 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"That's true, but it doesn't push pixels any faster than a contemporary pro DSLR does. The larger sensor=more heat argument could hold, especially since the body was designed to hold the CCD sensor from the previous version."

The Pentax is pushing a crap-ton of data, but my post saying 16bit was incorrect. The HD video is interesting too, and considering how warm my 60D gets, I assume the Pentax is dealing with this as well.  The Pentax needs to do that all while sealed.  If I needed a large sensor, and was buying my own, I would go for this.  If I win the lottery, i might anyway :D."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vw00r,Rockchurch,1 point,Sun Feb 15 01:32:12 2015 UTC,I thought it was a decoy pin so it would be harder to pick...
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vw00r,FLY1NGP4ND45,0,Wed Feb 18 06:17:21 2015 UTC,"You only need to pick the pins that prevent the lock from turning. If you pick the first five pins the lock will turn before you try to pick the sixth.  And order doesn't matter, as you don't generally keep working on one pin till you get it. Instead you just try a few times and move on to the next one in the hopes that they'll catch earlier and that when they do, the pressure on the cylinder will transfer to the remaining 'locked' pins, making them easier to pick.   In essence you're working on the pins that are stickiest first, and when picked it makes the remaining pins stickier. A pin that doesn't have to move will never be the stickiest, and once the rest are picked, the lock opens. You wouldn't waste any material time on it. It would be harder to pick if it required picking."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vw00r,Fuyuri,2,Sun Feb 15 06:30:25 2015 UTC,"Absolutely nothing. It's called forcing the lock. It's harder than one might think though. You need something that is simultanneously small enough to fit into the lock, provide enough leverage, and be a fair bit stronger than all pins within the lock.  It helps if you freeze the brass pins first.  Edit: also, the pins have a huge advantage within the lock. They are reinforced on all sides, essentially. Most likely, whatever you're using is going to end up twisting, bending, and breaking. On the plus side, you'll probably also ruin the lock to the point where the key won't open it nor will a pick due to slightly bent pins. It would likely have to be removed."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vsrbx,magical_midget,22,Fri Feb 13 19:53:49 2015 UTC,Actually now almost all lenses are designed by algorithms on supercomputers to get the most efficient piece of glass.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vsrbx,rustygee,22,Fri Feb 13 21:17:29 2015 UTC,"I want to know who designs the mechanisms, not the optics. The telephoto zooms have some sort of continuous variable transmission that moves the focus group different amounts per degree of focus ring rotation depending on the zoom setting, and crazy things like that."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vsrbx,CarVac,24,Fri Feb 13 22:41:34 2015 UTC,"It's dynamics/machine design.   Optics tells how the lenses should be positioned for different focal lengths which can be defined as a function of linear position (unless you have a tilt-shift lens everything is moving forward/backward). Then they define focusing also as a function of position for the elements. Once that is done, they have a complete model of how all the elements will move when going from wide to telephoto and what focusing will look like at every focal length. Then they can take the movement of each grouping and define that as a function of rotation (basically they convert the linear movement into some type of helix). Then they put sleeves with those helix's cut into them around the lens elements so we can turn them and move things.   These cutaways are cool but they're a really difficult way to understand things. If you cut a pizza with a ton of toppings and then take a picture of the side and try to explain that to someone who has never experienced one, well... it'll be confusing. It's an impressively complicated way to look at something.   tl;dr: Engineering student has no idea what he's saying but makes an educated guess."

Sometimes it is a differential thread but the complexity is rarely required. Normally you'd expect mechanical engineers to do the design but actually they are machinists and toolmakers, sometimes watchmakers. There is a reason why Switzerland and Germany are renown in the art. Their watchmaking tradition produced artisans and machinery which were perfectly suitable for manufacturing of optics.   If you feel like researching you could look for the work of Newton, Abbe, Zeiss, Ramsden and so on. Many old books on optics at archive.org  Maybe most of all I would recommend reading a book on amateur telescope building.  Here is a short list Many are available as PDFs. Also many old optics books at archive.org all free to download. For example this gem might be interesting :)"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vsrbx,HAL-42b,1 point,Sat Feb 14 09:05:42 2015 UTC,It looks a lot more complicated than it is because it's cut in half.

Little story about dust in lenses: I bought a used Minolta for a walk-around lens off of eBay. Lens came in one piece, looked great, and worked very well. For $300 I couldn't have asked for a better lens. However, there was one spec that I couldn't clean. It was below the glass. At first I thought it was something stuck onto the lens, so I sprayed a tiny bit of Windex and wiped it as well as I could with a piece of microfiber cloth. Nothing happened. Actually, something did. I saw some rainbow-colored film developing behind the glass and I figured that the lens must come apart. I thought that it would have been an issue of taking off the front element, wiping it, and things are good. But it turns out that dust is really visible when there's a black background, and my attempts were failing. In fact, I noticed that the original spec was still there, so I had to remove the tape holding the 2 front elements together and managed to clean both the film and the spec that started the whole issue.  So now I had a problem. There was always something when I sealed the lens up. Nothing I tried worked, until I busted out my vacuum cleaner and used its exhaust. The exhaust is very powerful and very clean (the thing is certified to be used as an air purifier in hospitals) So I set it to full blast and assemble the lens piece by piece on top of that stream of clean air. Took me a while, but I got the lens together without a spec of dust visible through the glass.  TL;DR: Bought a used lens, dust was inside the glass, Windex leaked in, had to disassemble, dust kept settling in while I reassembled, and my vacuum cleaner provided a stream of clean air for me to assemble things in."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vrbi1,parisskys201,7,Sat Feb 14 02:26:53 2015 UTC,"Some years ago I searched the internet for history on these type of diesel engines. The ""mother"" of all these engine was called the V-2 and used in WII in T34 and KV tanks. The T-90 uses the V-92 variant of that very same engine 1st used 75 years ago. This below is a google translated history (russian to english) of this engine type. Unfortunately I cannot find the original source anymore.  Part1 The V-2 diesel engine, taken into service with the T-34 and KV tanks, became the most important tank engine ever made. It was the first high speed diesel engine for tanks developed in the Soviet Union and used for the majority of its main battle tanks. Starting at 500 hp, the engine has received various improvement, which brought the power output of the latest versions up to 1.200 hp. Even though this is probably marking the end of the development, the V-2 has its place in history and will stay in production and service for the next centuries.  While the V-2 was originally intended to power medium tanks, further developments resulted also in in the V-12 class for heavy tanks and V-6 for light vehicles. Today, these engines of this family can be found in tracked and wheeled combat vehicles, large trucks and power generators.  AD-1 First Appearance: 1931 Country: Soviet Union The development of the V-2 engine started in the early 1930s. The Soviet government made a decision for the development of high speed diesel engines to be used in military vehicles and planes. The fuel type was mainly chosen because of its availability, but also because of the expected lower fuel consumption compared to gasoline engines. Diesel engines used so far, were slow rotating engines, used for ships or power supplies. Different teams started working on the engines for planes and vehicles, as both types were expected to have different characteristics. Vehicle engines have a much harder life, as they are constantly stressed with different loads, face much more dust and shocks from going thru rough terrain. Plane engines usually run on constant speed and have to develop full power only during short periods of time.  Development of the engine was done in different design offices, but the roots of the V-2 are in Kharkov. The first engine developed was the AD-1 (?????????-1), an engine intended to be used on a plane. A first design of the AD-1 was finished by early 1931. It described a 12-cylinder 4-stroke V-type diesel engine, developing 500 HP at a max rotation speed of 1.600 rpm. While development of the engine was going on, the design was taken as base for the development of a tank engine.  BD-2 First Appearance: 1932 Country: Soviet Union The new project was designated BD-2 (???????????? ??????-2) and should develop a fast rotating diesel engine of the 500 HP class for the use in main battle tanks. The decision to base the development on an engine for planes introduced several new features to a vehicle engine. The first of course was the rotation speed, which was much higher than with other diesel engines. A second one was the weight, which is a limiting factor in planes. And most important, the engine was equipped with a dry sump lubrication system. The new engine followed the same design as the AD-1. It was again a water cooled V-12 4 stroke diesel engine with one entry and one exit valve for each cylinder. One of the goals of the development was the reduction of engine mass as much as possible. This could be achieved by using aluminum alloy for the crank case, parts of the cylinder banks and the complete cylinder head. As space wasn’t such a limiting factor, as it would have been with a plane engine, the angle between the two cylinder banks was increased from 45 to 60 degrees.  The first prototype of the BD-2 could be finished in 1933, but it was far from being perfect. The official requirement was 100h run without issues, which couldn’t be achieved at all. Instead, the engine broke down long before and showed various mechanical defects. In addition to the displayed wear, engineers could also observe lots of vibration, enormous oil consumption and smoke in the exhaust gasses.  As a result, the designers had to rework the engine and go thru several more iterations of state tests. The engine received larger cylinders with a bore of 150 and a stroke of 180 mm, increasing the volume to 38.8 l. In addition, the cylinder heads and the chambers were redesigned and amount of valves was doubled. The valves were controlled by double overhead camshafts. A last change was the usage of a Soviet designed fuel pump instead of a German one supplied by Bosch. This change was not done to improve the engines performance, but to be able to produce an engine independent from other countries. Other changes were mainly towards the production process and the quality f work delivered. As the engine came closer to the required quality and a serial production was more and more likely, the designation changed officially to V-2.  BD-2A First Appearance: 1935 Country: Soviet Union The BD-2A was a prototype, supposed to be used in small and medium size planes. It was based on the latest BD-2 version, but mounted a simple turbo charger. Power output of the engine was 600HP at 1.850 RPM.  A prototype of the BD-2A was produced and even tested in the air. The development was stopped in 1936, due to the availability of more powerful engines.  V-2 First Appearance: 1937 Country: Soviet Union The designation V-2 was used for the BD-2 starting in 1937. The last two years before actual serial production started, have been used for debugging the design. Several smaller series were produced and finally in December 1939 the engine received a go for mass production. Only factory producing the engine was placed in Kharkov, which became a serious issue when the war broke out.  After the V-2 was accepted for service use, mass production was started and speeded up very quickly. At the same time, several versions of the V-2 were designed and taken into production one by one.  The original V-2 was used for one vehicle only, the BT-7M. The BT tank was used during the development of the V-2 as test vehicle, to check for the overall usage of the new diesel engine within tanks. When the V-2 was finally available, the BT-7 production was modified and received the first ones. Reason for this was also to get as many engines as possible into active service, so teething problems could be overcome as soon as possible."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vrbi1,thesimp,8,Fri Feb 13 21:18:13 2015 UTC,"Part2  V-2-34 First Appearance: 1939 Country: Soviet Union more Pictures...  The V-2-34 is a version of the V-2 adjusted for the usage in the famous T-34 tank. It was a V-12 cylinder liquid cooled DOHC diesel engine with a max power of 500 HP at 1.800 RPM. The engine has the same design and output as the base V-2, it just received adjusted hull mounting, fuel and cooling connectors, as well as a refined clutch. The V-2-34 features an aluminum alloy body and is meant to be mounted lengthwise in the vehicle hull. Two cylinder banks with 6 cylinders each were placed in an angle of 60 degrees. The pistons are linked to the central crank shaft by wrist connecting rods, which means that only six rods are directly connected to the crank shaft. This special design also results in a slightly lower stroke in both sides of the engine. The right side has a stroke of 186.7 mm and 180mm in the cylinders on the left bank.  The V-2-34 is a DOHC engine, which means two overhead camshafts for each cylinder bank, one controlling the input and one the output valves. Each cylinder is has two input and two output ones.  The engine uses a dry sump lubrication system. Before engine start, the loader of the tank has to manually pump oil from the main reservoir into the engine. Once the engine is started, a mechanical lubrication pump takes over, which presses the majority of the oil onto the crank shaft and the connected rods. A smaller part if fed into the cylinder heads on the camshafts.  One large cooling radiators is mounted on each side of the engine, each responsible for one cylinder bank.  Two box type air cleaners were mounted to the rear of the engine. Each cleaner contained a cyclic filter, as well as oil soaking metal mesh for fine cleaning. Cleaning performance of this design was extremely bad, resulting in the low service life time of the engine. Starting of the engine was done with an electric starter, mounted at the engine rear on top of the transmission. An auxiliary starter based on pressurized air was also available. It was using air from one tank mounted in the hull front. The tank was not equipped with a compressor, which meant that the tanks had to be filled using an external system.  Before starting the engine, the cooling liquid and the engine oil had to be brought to a certain temperature. This was mainly due to the fact that the oil used had a very high viscosity at low temperatures. As there was no pre-heater installed, the crews had two ways to heat up the liquids. First of all, the liquids could be taken out of the engine and warmed externally. A more combat like way was the use of a small stove. It was placed under the hull and a door under the engine was opened. The heat and smoke of the engine was flowing thru the engine compartment, warming it up. The V-2-34 was a new engine, which had a negative impact on the performance of the T-34. The engines produced during the first years and until about 1943, didn’t come with a lifetime as expected. Normally, the engine should be able to run for 100h without issues. But due to material and quality issues the engines often didn’t came that far. Continuous improvements during the war increased the life time of the engine constantly to values of 300h and beyond.  One has to keep in mind that the complete manufacturing was shipped behind the Urals in a couple of weeks, which is a masterpiece on its own.  V-2K First Appearance: 1939 Country: Soviet Union Late in 1939, a second version of the V-2 was taken into production, the V-2K. It was adjusted for another just tank entering serial production, the heavy KV-1. The engine got later also reused for the KV-2.  In principle, the V-2K is identically to the V-2. Main differences are an increased injection pressure and a higher max speed of the engine. The power output was increased from 500 to 600 HP. The downside was an even higher wear, resulting in lower lifetime of the engine.  In general, the V-2K showed an average performance. It was pretty new and detailed improvements had to take place during serial production. But it was also too small for the large KV-1 tank, which would have required a much more powerful engine. Further increase of the engine speed was not possible, as this would have resulted in too many vibrations and stress for the mechanical parts.  V-2V First Appearance: 1940 Country: Soviet Union The V-2V is a special version of the V-2, adjusted for the use in light vehicles, which wouldn’t require the full power of the V-2. Main focus of the development was therefore not the power output, but more the increased lifetime. To achieve it, the engine was limited to 375 HP only.  The V-2V was used for one vehicle only, the artillery tractor Voroshilovets. It was produced in a small number in Kharkov and later in Stalingrad.  V-2L/P First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union The V-2L/P were designs for vessel engines. Main difference is that the V-2L rotates to the left and the V-2P rotates to the right. This way, it would be possible to mount both on one ship and counter the momentum resulting from the usage of one engine.  Designed before the brake of WW2, the V-2L/P never made it into production.  V-2SN First Appearance: 1940 Country: Soviet Union As other countries did later in the war, the Soviet Union started already pretty early with the development of heavy tanks. As some experience with the KV-1 was available, lack of propulsion power was seen as one big issue. That’s why a new improved version of the V-2 was being developed, called V-2SN (?????? ???????????). Most important change was the use of a single speed supercharger, borrowed from the AM-38 aircraft engine. It boosts the max power available to 862 HP. But as it is a super charger, it was also difficult to handle. At low speed, the power of the engine was not available, but when the super charger kicked it, the increase in power was pretty high. It also resulted in a high stress for engine, transmission and crew. The V-2SN was used with the KV-3 tank only.  V-2-10/IS First Appearance: 1943 Country: Soviet Union The V-2-10 or V-2IS is a version of the V-2, which was especially modified for usage in the new IS-2 tank. The engine comes with a slightly higher max speed of 2.000 RPM, resulting in a max power of 520 HP. Adjustments for the use with the IS-2 have been done by strengthening the cylinder walls and heads, increasing the performance of the fuel pump, using larger radiators for the engine and oil cooling and adjust the hull mounts. The overall height of the engine was reduced by moving the water pump from the crank case to the engine side.  One new feature of the V-2IS was the usage of a new dual starter for the engine. Central unit is a fly wheel, which can be connected to the crank shaft using a clutch and a planetary gear box. Speeding up the fly wheel can be done manually or by an electric starter engine. Manual means that a crew member plugs a hand crank in the hull rear and starts to turn it. When the fly wheel reaches a certain speed, the clutch is locked by the driver and the engine gets started. The electric starter works in a similar way, just with less blood and sweat for crew.  V-11 First Appearance: 1945 Country: Soviet Union The V-11 is a new version of the V-2, which was developed for the heavy IS-3 tank. The engine is based on the V-2-10 and comes with the same max power of 520 HP, but only at 2.200 RPM. Because of its size, the IS-3 is using a new cooling system, which eats up a significant part of the engine power."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vrbi1,thesimp,5,Fri Feb 13 21:18:55 2015 UTC,"Part3  V-12 First Appearance: 1946 Country: Soviet Union The development of the IS-4 tank clearly pointed out, that a much stronger engine was need. It was quite obvious, that the 520 HP of the V-11 were not enough for a future tank. As the design of the V-2 didn’t allow any further increase in power, a new development branch, specialized for the needs of heavy vehicles, was started. The general design of the engine was kept, which would enable sharing of spare parts and knowledge. But weight and dimensions were adjusted, as well as various constructive details. Yet, the decision was taken at the right moment. One engine, supporting various types of vehicles, was not feasible anymore.  Most important change in the W-12 was the usage of a turbo charger, taken from the AM-38F engine. It was mounted to the front of the engine and power directly by the crankshaft. Air was taken in at the front and pushed thru two large pipelines at the top of the charger to the two cylinder banks.  To be able to handle the additional power of the engine, various other changes were necessary. Most visible one was a modification of the cooling system. Each cylinder bank received two connectors, one on the first and one on the sixth cylinder. This allowed faster cooling, but also more even cooling to all cylinders. Oil and water pumps were moved to the lower crankcase, where the supply with lubrication oil was much easier. Fuel was supplied using a NK-12 injection pump. And a G-73 generator was used to produce up to 1.5 kW of electric energy.  All these changes enabled a max power output of 750 hp for the V-12 engine. But the control of this huge power would require several years of mass production and usage, the V-12 was only the beginning. Many issues and a low reliability finally prevented a massive usage of the engine. Only a few hundred were produced and used only with the also very unpopular IS-4 tank.  V-12M First Appearance: 1950 Country: Soviet Union From 1953 onwards, the existing V-12 engines were receiving the AM-42 turbo charger instead of the AM-38F one. The new V-12M had the same power output as the previous version, just the dimensions increased slightly.  The V-12M was used only with the IS-4M tank.  V-12-5 First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union The new IS-10 tank, which was later renamed to T-10, was the next tank to receive a V-12 heavy tank engine. Based on the experiences with the base model, several modifications were made. Most obvious is the usage of the loader borrowed from the AM-42 airplane engine. It has a larger diameter and produced higher pressure. Together with a modified injection system, the V-12-5 was producing 700 hp at 2.100RPM. This was less than the 750 hp of the V-12. But in return, the engine was much more reliable.  V-12-6B First Appearance: 1954 Country: Soviet Union The new T-10B tank was supposed to receive an improved version of the V-12, called V-12-6 and delivering 750 hp. But the tank was also introducing a dual plane stabilization for the main gun, which required more electric energy. There-for the engine was also equipped with the G-5 generator and directly designated V-12-6B.  The output of the V-12-6B was increased by using a new UNA-6 loader. It was again powered by the crankshaft, but mounted closer to the engine, which ensured easier lubrication and thus less friction. Compared to the previous loader, the UNA-6 had again a larger diameter and increased the pressure of the combustion air.  V-12-6V First Appearance: 1957 Country: Soviet Union The V-12-6V was introduced with the T-10M tank. Only difference was the usage of a more powerful G-6 generators, delivering 6.5 kW of electric energy.  V-12-5B First Appearance: 1956 Country: Soviet Union The usage of a single plane gun stabilizer in the new T-10A required more electric energy. The solution was the usage of the G-5 generator, which produced 5k W of electric energy. The engine with the new generator was designated V-12-5B.  V-44 First Appearance: 1944 Country: Soviet Union The new T-44 tank changed some of the design standards previously used with the T-34 for many years. One of them was the usage of a new and much wider hull with a different engine compartment. As a result, the engine had to be redesigned and used in a new way. The V-44 is the first engine of the V-2 family, which is mounted laterally in the hull rear. This change affected the usage of all other units in the engine compartment, from transmission to coolers. The air filters were replaced by new cyclic filters, mounted in front of the engine close to the turret. At the same time, cooling fan was changed and replaced by a simpler one. Power output of the engine stayed unchanged.  The V-44 was the first laterally mounted V-2 version and started a design, which is used until today. All tanks following the T-44, starting with the T-54 until the modern T-90, are using the same arrangement.  V-54 First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union The V-54 is a slightly modified version of the V-44 and used with the T-54 tank. The engine was reduced in width, which reduced the mass and slightly increased the max power to 520 HP. At the same time, it allowed the usage of larger air cleaners. This was necessary, as the early T-54 was facing severe issues with air cleaning, resulting in heavy damages to the engine and eventually even stopped the mass production for redesigning of the cleaning equipment.  The V-54 was started with an electric power generator and had the air pressure system as auxiliary starter. The engine also came with an air compressor, allowing the refilling of the air tanks. The engine also introduced an electric oil pump, used to build up a basic oil pressure in the engine before it got started.  V-55 First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union more Pictures...  The V-55 was the engine installed in the T-55. It only introduced smaller improvements, but had max power of 580 HP and max torque of 2.352 Nm. These changes were again an updated air filtration, a higher compression, a more powerful lubrication pump and a fine tuned fuel injection.  For the first time, compressed air was used as primary engine starter. The electric one was still available, but only used in case there was not enough pressure in the air system available.  V-55V First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union The V-55V is basically identical to the V-55. It received a changed exhaust design and was used on board of the T-62 tank.  V-55U First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union The V-55U is basically a V-55V with some detail improvements to the fuel injection system. The changes resulted in an increased power of 620 HP. The new engine was used on board of the T-62M and T-55AMV tanks.  V-45K First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union The V-45K was used for the new object 172 and object 173 tanks. For the first time a mechanical loader was used, boosting the max power of the engine to 730 HP. The V-45K was only a prototype and got further developed into the more reliable and powerful V-46."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vrbi1,thesimp,4,Fri Feb 13 21:19:11 2015 UTC,"Part4  V-46 First Appearance: 1971 Country: Soviet Union The V-46 was fielded in 1971 together with the new T-72 tank. To beat the T-64 in mobility, a new powerpack including a high power diesel engine was used. The model of choice was the new V-46. It was derived from the V-45K and at that time, the most modern version of the proven V-2. The engine is based on the V-55V, but introduces two major changes: multi fuel capability and the usage of a mechanically connected loader.  The V-46 is a light weight 12 cylinder V-type engine. The engine body, crank case and cylinder heads are made of aluminum alloy, while cylinder liner, piston rod and crank shaft are made of steel. The pistons are made from duralumin.  Each cylinder has two input and two output valves, controlled by two overhead camshafts.  The engine is using wrist connecting rods to connect the pistons to the crank shaft. The right piston rod is connected to the crank shaft, while the rod of the opposite left cylinder is linked to a bearing in the right piston rod.  Power of the engine is given over the crank shaft to an intermediate gearbox and on to the variable speed gearboxes. Besides, the engine also offers a manual power take off. It is used to power several auxiliary parts of the engine, including overhead camshafts, fuel injection pump, as well as fuel, lubrication and water pumps. Compressor, starter generator and cooling fan are not directly connected to the engine.  While the previous versions of the engine were pure diesel engines, the V-46 is also able to run on carburetor fuel or any mix of the two. While diesel engines are usually able to burn other fuels as well, the fuel pump had to be improved. This is mainly due to the fact that diesel is used as lubricator for the pump. To enable running on carburetor fuel, an external lubrication is needed. Therefore the mechanically operated NK-12M fuel connection pump is directly connected to the engines lubrication system. The system is designed as an inline pump with 12 individual pump elements. Each of them is connected to one cylinder. To handle different fuel types, a small handwheel allows the selection of diesel, kerosene or carburetor fuel. In general, the fuel system of the V-46 engine has a fairly simple setup. Fuel is delivered by an electric pump from the vehicles tanks thru coarse and a fine filters to the fuel injection pump. The larger part of the fuel is then injected thru two injection valve into each cylinder. A smaller portion flows into a central compensation tank below the engine. It is also used to release pressure from the fuel system in case the fuel is heating up and expanding.  Second important change introduced with the V-46 is the usage of a mechanically driven centrifugal compressor N-46 (???????????). It is mounted on the right side of the engine beside the cylinders. A spur gear transmission and clutches connect the compressor to the crank shaft. The gear ratio is fixed to 13,33 and the compressor is active at any engine speed. The compressor sucks in air thru the air filters of the tank, compresses it to nearly 19 psi and presses it thru the input valves into the combustion chambers of the engine. As a result, more air is available for each combustion step, which allows the usage of more fuel, thus increasing the power and torque output of the engine. Maximum power of the engine is given with 574 kW / 780 HP and the max torque is 3.087 Nm.  To handle the resulting heat, the lubrication and cooling systems of the V-46 are adjusted accordingly. The engine is using a dry sump lubrication system, which ensures proper lubrication supply in nearly all conditions the tank is in. Maybe not when it’s flipped over, but that is a different story. A total of 65l oil is kept in a main tank (27l) and the refill tank (38l). Only the main tank is part of the lubrication circulation. The oil in the refill tank is taken over in case of low oil level. Before engine start, an electric MZN-2 oil pump is used to create a certain pressure in the engine. At the same time, the pump is connected to the cooling system and an electric pre-heater. After the engine has been started, a mechanical oil pump, mounted on the lower part of the crank shaft housing is used. The mechanical lubrication pump comes with three stages. The first one takes the oil from the main tank and presses it thru the MAF (???????? ??????) oil filter into the engines crank shaft housing. From there it’s distributed to the pistons and the overhead cam shafts. Finally, the oil drops down into the two oil sumps at the lower part of the engine. From there, the two suction stages of the lubrication pump move the oil back to the main tank. Parts of the oil, usually 20-30% is directed thru a centrifugal filter as well. The filter has a valve, which controls the oil intake and is operated only based on the pressure in the lubrication system.  To control the thermal conditions within the lubrication cycle, the system is equipped with two large oil coolers. In case the oil temperature reaches a certain level, a valve is switched, which directs the oil thru the radiators, before it flows back into the main tank. In general, the lubrication system works without issue. The only thing that needs to be done is the pre-heating of the highly viscous lubrication oil.  The V-46 is using water cooling for the cylinders, cylinder heads and oil pumps. The system is also connected to a pre-heating system. Design of the cooling system depends on the vehicle used.  Primary mean to start the engine is compressed air. The engine is connected to the tank’s compressed air cycle. It is powered by a compressor connected to the engine’s crank shaft. Larger metal tanks inside the vehicles hull are used to store the compressed air.  To start the engine, air is taken from the tanks and guided thru pipelines into the cylinders, pushing the pistons down. As the process is performed in independently in the different cylinders based on the piston position, the crank shaft is getting into rotation. Afterwards fuel is injected and ignited, finally starting the engine. An electric starter is also available, which is connected to the intermediate gearbox and also acts as a power generator.  The V-46 diesel engine was used with the early T-72 tanks only. It was fast replaced by the V-46-6.  V-46-6 First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union The V-46-6 is an improved version of the V-46. It introduced various detailed changes and was fielded with the T-72 build during the late 1970s. It was also used with the T-72A, T-72M and T-72M1. There are basically two main changes: - Two compensation tanks for the cooling system are mounted, one on top and one below the engine - Mounting of a new version of the lubrication filter and the lubrication centrifuge to the right of the engine of both side of the centrifugal compressor. The new position of the filters allowed easier access and maintainability.  V-46-4 First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union The V-46-4 is a low power version of the V-46-6. It was developed for the usage in smaller vehicles, which would not require the full 780 HP. The engine is limited to max power of 700 HP and max torque of 2.844 Nm.  The V-46-4 is used by the MT-T family of vehicles, including BAT-2, BG-1, MDK-3, UPG-92 and GM-569. It has to be noted that all these vehicles are originally based on the T-64.  V-46F/V-67 First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union The V-46F was developed as part of the object 172-2M development. The engine was using a new mechanical loader, borrowed once again from a plane engine The max power increased to 840 HP, but high oil consumption, as well as wear and tear were far beyond expectations. The engine showed bad reliability and was not excepted for service usage.  V-84 First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union The V-84 diesel engine has been developed to cope with the higher weight of the later versions of the T-72 family vehicles. To produce a higher output, the airflow into the cylinders was optimized, allowing more air to reach the combustion chamber. The result was a higher max power if 840 HP. Unfortunately, the increased power output was also resulting in an increased exhaust temperature. As thermal signature was getting an important factor in the tanks camouflage, the V-84 was not accepted for the usage in any MBT. Instead, it was used for engineering and recovery vehicles only."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vrbi1,thesimp,6,Fri Feb 13 21:19:40 2015 UTC,"Part5  V-84MS First Appearance: Country: Soviet Union more Pictures...  The V-84MS is a modified version of the V-84 with a redesigned exhaust pipe. It is using silfons, which produce a stack effect. While the hot exhaust gasses are blown out of the engine, cold air is sucked in thru the silfons, cooling the exhaust gases before leaving the hull, thus reducing the thermal signature of the tank. The MS in the designation stands for ?????????????????? ? ??????????, modernized with silfons. Max power of the engine is 840 HP.  V-92S2 First Appearance: Country: Russia more Pictures...  The T-90 tank was designed as deep modernization of the T-72B MBT for the Russian Army. To improve the overall mobility of the vehicle, a more powerful version of the V-84MS engine was needed. This was achieved by replacing the centrifugal compressor by a turbo charger. It is a more efficient design and increased the max power of the V-92S2 to 1.000 HP, while max torque reaches 4.046 Nm.  The usage of a turbo charger required a change in the design of the exhaust system. Previous versions used on large manifolds on each side of the engine, collecting the exhaust gas from each cylinder bank. Both manifolds were connected at the left side of the engine at the exhaust. The V-92S2 mounts the turbo charger on the right side of the engine, same place where previously the radial compressor was placed. The two exhaust manifolds are now tunneling the exhaust gases towards the turbo charger on the right. There they exit the charger on the top into a large exhaust pipe, placed on top of the engine and connected to the hull exhaust on the left side.  The V-92S2 engine is used for the T-90A and T-90S.  V-99 First Appearance: Country: Russia The latest and most powerful version of the V-2 is the V-99. It’s equipped with a twin-turbo charger and reaches a max power of 1.200 HP. The V-99 is in prototype state and not used in any MBT at this time.  D12A-525 First Appearance: 1965 Country: Soviet Union more Pictures...  The D12A-525 has been developed out of the need for an engine for large trucks. The vehicle in question was the MAZ-537 tank transporter and all his versions.  The engine was optimized for reliability and easier maintenance. The max speed is given with 2.000 RPM, the max power with 525 HP. The engine has a guaranteed lifetime of 1.500 h.  V-2-450AV-S3 First Appearance: Country: Russia more Pictures...  The V-2-450AV-S3 shows once more the flexibility of the aging V-2 engine and the wide range of it's usage.  The engine was developed for the usage in oil drilling equipment, especially powering oil pumps. This specific usage usually comes with static engine speed, but requires extreme reliability.  The V-2-450AV-S3 has a maximum power of 450 HP and a guaranteed time between maintenance windows of 2.500 h.  1D12-400 First Appearance: Country: Russia more Pictures...  Another unusual usage of the V-2 engine comes with the 1D12-400. The engine is primarily used in small locomotives and rail snow plows. Both require special power take offs and usage of special transmissions. The engine also come with specific control equipment and connectors for the cooling systems.  Maximum power of the 1D12-400 is given with 400 HP.  1D12V-300K First Appearance: Country: Russia more Pictures...  The 1D12V-300K is a static diesel engine to power electric power generators. The fuel injection, cooling and lubrication systems have been adjusted for static usage, which increased the liability to 750 h. The maximal power of the engine is 300 HP."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vo2f4,dammitkarissa,9,Thu Feb 12 23:50:15 2015 UTC,The airshafts of the queen's chamber don't lead to the outside and were closed of from the inside until modern times.  The shafts of the king's chamber do lead outside but because they are very long and out of limestone (which is very porous) no water flows into the burial chamber.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vo2f4,BetaKeyTakeaway,3,Fri Feb 13 01:54:33 2015 UTC,Thanks! Is there a porosity scale for stone?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vo2f4,dammitkarissa,7,Fri Feb 13 02:05:27 2015 UTC,"Rocks have quite a wide range of porosity depending mostly on type, depth and age, so there is not really a scale like there is for hardness (there are porosity tables on a local level though).  In general sedimentary rocks are more porous than other types of rock.   The limestone the pyramid were built with are obviously from a very low depth and therefore relatively porous. You can see this directly on the ""weathering"" of the Sphinx: The porous limestone draws groundwater up via capillary action, dissolving salt on its way. The salt then crystallizes on the surface, destroying the rock."

The churchy-girl in the group got to blast out Amazing Grace on this massive organ to a mostly empty concert hall.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vmyqu,scorinth,5,Thu Feb 12 18:25:09 2015 UTC,"There's an amusing story somewhere about how the Architect originally planned for the shells to be much more important to the structure and the interior design, but when he handed them over to a structural engineer, the engineer basically said, ""Yeah, this isn't going to work, bro."" and they had to redesign a lot of the building.  So maybe in an alternate universe, you could have looked up and seen them - until they came crashing down and killed everyone inside."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vmyqu,MeccIt,3,Thu Feb 12 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"Yep - nearly right.  The way the architect had originally designed it, each shell segment would be unique and require a custom built formwork to cast it  (think space shuttle tiles, but thousands of times bigger).    The young engineer, Peter Rice, had a great idea that kept the form of the architect's vision (the sails), but made it feasible by making each concrete piece a segment of a standardised sphere - this way all of the curves would be similar even if the pieces were different sizes.   Appearance only.   (but with a side effect of being fantastically strong arches)  As to the outside/inside - isn't this building huge and exposing the form inside remove a lot of the working rooms and completely screw up the acoustics?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vmyqu,thyming,3,Thu Feb 12 20:27:15 2015 UTC,"Huh. The way I heard it, the problems with the casting of the shells meant that they could not be thin load-bearing shells as originally planned and so part of the necessary work in the re-design process was to add a different load-bearing structure underneath. You must construct additional pylons.  Can you speak to the accuracy of that version of the story?  As far as opening up the inside of the building, the performance halls seem to be about the highest rooms in the building, which along with the huge glass facades and the story about the redesign suggests that the original plan may have been to have the performance halls extend upward and outward to the shells. The cutaway suggests that expanding them in those directions would not displace much of the office and workshop areas, and the acoustics could be maintained by careful design of the shape of the interior along with proper surface treatments.  Then again, that building is a lot older than I thought. I don't know if the state of the art would have been up to the task in the fifties. I don't know, I'm studying machine design and control, not acoustic engineering or structural engineering."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vmyqu,Farmchuck,2,Thu Feb 12 20:57:06 2015 UTC,"I'm recollecting from a TV documentary on the design/building of the Opera House shown many years ago - they showed graphically how the sails, when redesigned, were all segments of the same (virtual) sphere, and this standardised the casting of the components.  I can't recollect the load bearing issue - my guess is that these 'tiles' would be self supporting within a larger skeleton, I don't think they were ever going to be the entire roof on their own (like a 3D bridge arch) - but that's only my guess.   As for acoustics - I'm an engineer as was only interested in the outside at the time :)  (I'm off to scour youtube for a copy of that documentary...)    Edit: - not the documentary I remember, but illustrating nonetheless  http://youtu.be/st3oi7W2vO0?t=2m40s  It also explained that the original architect 'left the project' at the external phase so I've no idea if the inside reflect his design or what his replacements had to come up with."

They're structural pointed arches that are self-supporting. It's a very efficient section. Also, they're sloped to collect rain and reduce snow load.  People must be erroneously be thinking that if a building's shell isn't the same on the interior then it isn't serving a functional purpose.  Also, you probably don't want the roof to be the same as a ceiling in a performance space. Structural and precipitative issues aside, you've just lost a lot of thermal and acoustic insulation if it's a single layer. When it's raining outside you still want the interior to be as quiet as possible."

I can't help but be a little disappointed that the outside structure is just a facade that serves no practical or acoustic purpose. I always assumed that the unique outside structure was designed to amplify or somehow improve the acoustics for performances held inside.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vmyqu,clark848,2,Thu Feb 12 18:13:40 2015 UTC,The outside has nearly always had no relationship to the acoustic inside - look at the Paris Opera  https://flic.kr/p/7tzr8t

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vjmmo,Computermaster,23,Wed Feb 11 23:17:53 2015 UTC,"This is indeed an Audi engine for a consumer car. I'm not a mechanic, but I hang out alot in /r/justrolledintotheshop. It's clear that Audi likes to over-engineer their cars, to the point that alot of relatively minor jobs require mechanics to disassemble a large portion of the car. It's good and bad though. Some people will tell you that the major disassembly makes doing the actual work much easier. So once a good tech becomes accustomed to tearing down the engine bay, work can go faster and there's no need to cram your hands into tight places like you'd expect with older American cars."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vjmmo,singularissententia,4,Wed Feb 11 23:59:44 2015 UTC,"To rephrase that, many mechanics don't mind working on these cars because they're fairly comfortable to work on and diagnose (sometimes, and not electrical systems) as you said. The downside is that it takes much longer to do the same job on an Audi as on a Honda, the mechanic needs to be more educated/trained, and parts are also more expensive. The cost of all of these is passed on to the consumer."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vjmmo,darthchurro,2,Thu Feb 12 02:55:25 2015 UTC,"The 2.0t's no different than any other modern car. Its not really over engineered, its the norm now.  Service position is a thing do to the motor being pushed forward in the bay. This makes room for the trans (in a north-sound arrangement) and gives you more leg room in the cabin.  I'd never own a v8 audi like whats pictured. Way too expensive. The 2.0t or 1.8t are where its at."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vjmmo,endmass,4,Thu Feb 12 06:41:06 2015 UTC,Holy hell
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vjmmo,Computermaster,4,Thu Feb 12 00:39:41 2015 UTC,This is why you don't buy a used Audi. See all those guides the press on the chain? They're lined with nylon that wears away and must be replaced or else the chain gets too slack and boom goes the engine as things touch that shouldn't. The only way to get at them is to remove the engine and transmission from the car and split (unbolt) them.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vjmmo,Runner303,3,Thu Feb 12 04:56:00 2015 UTC,Ford has an engine thats the same arrangement?  Any motor with a chain has tensioners like this. Its pretty standard.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vjmmo,bitshoptyler,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:22:37 2015 UTC,"It's not that they love to over-engineer the cars, it's that they have a particular concept in mind for a car, and they figure out what needs to be done to make it work.   In the S4's case, they wanted to use a V8, but the engine bay was only big enough for a V6. So they redesigned the engine to have the timing and accessory drive at the rear next to the firewall, driven by compact chains and sprockets instead of a traditional belt drive. The result is a V8 that's roughly the same overall length as a traditional V6."

So I was curious what sort of power this thing was potentially making, and if this article is to be believed, it's a 2.0L engine making more than 650hp.  Not bad for technology from the 1970s."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2vb3fg,soloxplorer,13,Mon Feb 9 17:01:59 2015 UTC,"Psh 650 hp from that motor is nothing!  In reality the 320i was a testbed to see how much turbo you could put on that engine (with a stock block) before it popped. Turns out a lot.  A few years later qualifying in F1 it was good for 1300hp in qualifying-grenade trim. FROM 1.5 LITERS. It remains the most powerful F1 engine ever made, and the only successful one that was from a roadcar that I can think of (Ferrari F50 was a detuned F1 V12, but started in F1).  All from an engine block designed in 1962. The builders actually specifically took old motors from a junkyard as they had relieved all of the internal stresses by that point. They then left the blocks out in the rain for ""seasoning"" as I've heard. Fascinating time in motorsports."

It took a lot of combat before anyone started realizing it was worth redesigning a lot of the plane to give a pilot better vision.  It even went out of style by the 1950s when the F-4 and such came about - who then got their asses kicked in Vietnam, then with the F-15/16 it was re-emphasized. And the argument is still ongoing, the F-35 has terrible pilot vision issues but the builders claim their synthetic-vision helmet will solve it."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2v6zfp,Ventura,3,Sun Feb 8 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"There is a long history behind the P51's (they were A-36 Apaches before they became the P51).   Originally ignored largely by the US because of the Allison engine's sluggish performance, they were adopted as a fighter escort by the British, who then threw the Merlin engine in them.  Once the US saw the performance increase with the new powerplant, they re designated them P-51's and adopted them in a escort/attack role (as opposed to their original plan of using the plane as a dive bomber).  My dad has told me several times about the story of these planes, and knew someone who had an original A-36 back when he was a kid."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2v2zfv,TheSillyLion,1 point,Sun Feb 8 08:53:45 2015 UTC,"In winter mode it generally shifts earlier and is more reluctant to shift down that is why in earlier models before the new 5 speed gearbox the switch is labeled E(economy) and S(standard) due to it being more economic, but the gearbox is really adaptive and adapts to your driving style on the fly, so if you drive really aggressive it adapts to that and stays in lower gears until you start driving more relaxed, again if you have it in winter mode it is more reluctant.  Also if you have it in winter mode it chooses a set of gears that gives a lower ratio in reverse  There is also a whole range of plasibo effects kicking in, like thinking the suspension gets harder in summer mode and thinking the ESP and antispin gets more aggressive in winter mode(i have still not figured out if that is the case or not)"

They have 400+ HP and I have seen one slide into a wall at 90 MPH ass first and sideways and the only thing that came of it was a bent axle tube, the axle didn't punch through the diff. or nothing, the car finished the race. It's the same construction as an F-150's rear end. It's just made lighter and used for racing. You can't argue with it. It IS a proven differential."

Including but not limited to:   Each one costs around $20,000 to make Each one has a detachable head with a whole suite of alternate head models for each facial expression. For the bigger productions such as Chicken Run, there were 30 or so film sets shooting simultaneously, each with their own crew, lighting, camera, animators and models so that the film didn't take 30 years to make. Wallace and Gromit were once left in a cab in London and later returned."

Usually the festivals are all the same and generally just have a bunch of tents rented out by people who sell homemade stuff. It's mostly country stuff like leather belts and brooms and a shit ton of tents selling various things made of repurposed house materials. Fine art wouldn't do well since it might be a bit pricey, but if people can buy custom belts for $30 and leather beer holsters for $20 I'm suse people would pay a little more for some art if it looks really good. And if youre able to spit them out fast enough then you'll end up on top. Look around for festivals like those in the early summer into fall.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2uqm6f,sprucenoose,16,Wed Feb 4 16:55:41 2015 UTC,"I got to visit one of the studios where the models are built. The amount of time and resources that go into the tiniest detail is what drives the cost up. It's the opposite of economy of scale; I met one guy who had spent 4 weeks painstakingly gluing each individual leaf onto a model tree. If that much effort is put into a background item, imagine how much work goes into the characters who are the starring role of the film.  The armatures inside the models are all created from scratch by engineers. The movements that give each model their individual character and personality are different from one to the next and so each character has their own bespoke armature.  On top of that, you've got custom made 'Ardman Mix' plasticine which is made in house and isn't cheap to produce. Plus as I mentioned earlier, each model has a set of removable heads, sometimes they themselves have unique mechanical innards, depending on the purpose of that head.  I should make it clear that it's the original version of each model which costs that much. Once all of the details have been worked out, the copies that are used for the simultaneous filming purposes cost less (but still in the thousands of dollars)."

It was mostly by accident as other flights were booked up and my travel agent found a promotion that meant I could fly the Concorde for the same price as a business class ticket on KLM (my final destination was the Netherlands).  To those wondering about the apparent small size of the airplane, it is true that it was a small plane. Inside the seats were narrow as well. It felt more like a commuter aircraft than a trans-continental aircraft.   Part of the reason why it doesn't look that small in pictures is that the windows of the Concorde are very small and therefore in photos appear in proportion to the fuselage in a manner similar to a larger aircraft.  Other than that recollection was standing outside the airport as another Concorde took off. It didn't sound like a plane. It sounded like someone lit a rocket engine. Low loud rumbling. The descent felt uncomfortably steeply angled, possibly to maximize time at cruise altitude or to deal with the noise restrictions.   I miss the Concorde dearly."

For those that dont know what an nmr instrument is, its used by scientists to investigate the structure and composition (to a degree!) of chemical compounds and other materials using a magnet field. The instrument is filled with liquid helium (about 3 kelvin temp) and then an outer jacket of liquid nitrogen (cant remember the temp of that off the top of my head but i want to say 77 kelvin...). The cold temps of liquid helium allow the superconducting magnet to work, and also allow it to generate a stable magnetic field. There is a probe at the bottom which detects how the molecule behaves in the magnetic field, and the sample is placed in a thin, long glass tube and inserted from the top. Its a very important development in the fields of chemistry and medicine - MRI machines are essentially a massive NMR instrument, and they work by looking at the difference between fats and water in the body and using the differences of how those two materials behave in a magnetic field to generate a picture."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,randomasesino2012,2,Mon Feb 2 05:22:52 2015 UTC,They were sworn to secrecy. They cannot even build another one in theory because the actual blueprints and every design was destroyed after the 40 plane production run to keep the plane a secret/ stop a Soviet copycat.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,Dilong-paradoxus,2,Mon Feb 2 15:59:42 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of sr-71s out there sitting in musuems. I bet you could reverse engineer it if you disassembled a couple.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,randomasesino2012,2,Mon Feb 2 20:10:01 2015 UTC,"They have had to scrap a few to rebuild the rest of the planes. Also, aircraft have a massive amount of parts. The B-17 bombers from WW2 alone had somewhere around 10 million IIRC and the blackbird was by far more complex.   If they were to do that to any plane, the B17 would definitely be on that list given the cost of them today given the low surviving numbers. I think there are only 10 left that can actually fly today (I have been lucky enough to see one fly over my house- my dad did not believe me until I showed him the picture given the rarity)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,McFreedom,3,Tue Feb 3 06:49:16 2015 UTC,"Where is the fuel located? Is it in the wings, or is it one of those big cylindrical bits in the centre fuselage?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,murl56,4,Mon Feb 2 04:54:21 2015 UTC,"I believe it is in the wings. I remember reading an article saying they would constantly leak fuel until they got to a certain speed, and something would change to where it wouldn't leak. I'll look into it and edit this comment when I find that article.     Fuselage panels were manufactured to only loosely fit on the ground. Proper alignment was achieved as the airframe heated up and expanded several inches.[28] Because of this, and the lack of a fuel sealing system that could handle the airframe's expansion at extreme temperatures, the aircraft leaked JP-7 fuel on the ground prior to takeoff.[29]   Wikipedia, the guy being cited is Richard Graham, an SR-71 pilot.    I used to have a big 30-40 book set of military cutaways, and the SR-71 was on book 28 and there were many more detailed cutaways of it within. I gave the whole book set away to a friend of mine several years ago, so I can't scan anything."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,zagadka-1,9,Mon Feb 2 04:58:01 2015 UTC,The panels of the Blackbird's 'skin' would expand at speed due to air friction heat and swell shut. The hull would get so warm that the pilots would hold their meals against the cockpit glass to warm them while flying.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,randomasesino2012,2,Mon Feb 2 05:01:28 2015 UTC,"Compression of air causes heating, not friction."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,zagadka-1,1 point,Mon Feb 2 09:14:30 2015 UTC,Actually it is a combination of both. The compression causes a majority of it but the friction still plays an important role.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,randomasesino2012,1 point,Mon Feb 2 16:03:15 2015 UTC,Do you know enough to elaborate on this important role?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,zagadka-1,1 point,Mon Feb 2 17:03:41 2015 UTC,"I know a decent amount about the concepts of it but I have not had to work with the actual effects of it on an aircraft. Basically as an aircraft reaches a higher speed the forces of the air compressing adds one component to the heating but the effects of friction by these particles adds another component since they actually are sliding along side the aircraft. From basic physics and chemistry you should know that W=Fxd and work increases the heat of a system. It might not seem like a lot given the thin air, but the aircraft is basically moving a lot of small particles out of the way with a massive force and a fairly significant distance. It builds up over time and at faster speeds to really increase the heat."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,McFreedom,1 point,Tue Feb 3 06:37:51 2015 UTC,"You didn't explain anything just restated what you said before!  When a supersonic object moves through air, the air cannot move out the way fast enough so it compresses, primarily on the leading edges of the body and wings (where present) and reaches high temperatures. Points at which the velocity of the air is zero and pressure and temperature are highest are the stagnation points. At Mach 3 the temperature at the stagnation points can be over 400 Deg C (800F). This hot air then conducts its heat to the object as it moves along it. There is also an effect of air sliding along the body (boundary layer skin friction) which will also heat the body. The relative contributions of the effects depend on the geometry of the body. The limiting factor for the SR71 is the temperature of the compressor inlet which is increased due to compression in the inlet.  Sources 1,2,3"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,masasuka,3,Tue Feb 3 14:53:51 2015 UTC,Yeah I heard that story too. It's hard to believe they couldn't invent an expanding joint of some kind that would solve that problem.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,McFreedom,3,Mon Feb 2 06:56:26 2015 UTC,"The problem is not taking the expansion, that's easy, it's expanding afterwards to fill the gap when things cool down. Most materials would be crushed to the point they won't spring back, and anything softer, like rubber, would be cooked."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ugscr,liotier,2,Mon Feb 2 08:06:56 2015 UTC,"They are not going to show everything in an artist's rendition but there was equipment in the nose cone. Honeycombing was first used in aircraft and rockets in the 1950s. Given the fact that this plane was developed in 1966 by Kelly Johnson, he probably would have taken that into account given his long and successful career in designing aircraft. If you do not believe me, look at the Wikipedia article for him regarding the aircraft he helped design and build. He can be named for a list of people that have stopped WW3 and who helped win WW2. The P-38 alone could make him a successful designer given the fact that the 2 highest scoring US aces of WW2 flew it, the Germans called it ""the fork tooth devil"" (the germans hated it), the Japanese called it ""2 planes, 1 pilot"", and the abilities the plane had in being a true multi role aircraft.  This is the actual citation from his medal of freedom:   ""Aeronautical engineer, his genius for conceiving unique airframes and his technical management skills contribute mightily to the Nation's security by creating aircraft of daring design with unmatched rapidity and effectiveness.""

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2udj1b,pixelrebel,624,Sun Feb 1 04:29:30 2015 UTC,"In general, an asymmetric core lets you drill the ball to behave differently.  Depending on where you drill the holes, and your style of bowling, you can make a ball hook at different distances on the lane or adjust how aggressive that hook is.  There are a number of reference points on the surface the ball that dictate how you drill a particular ball like the Pin, the Positive Access Point (PAP), the Center of Gravity (CG), and the Mass Bias. Here's a generic drilling pattern and a little more in depth PDF.  It also makes it so the ball doesn't roll over the same surface on the way down the lane. We call this track flare.  And finally, asymmetric cores allow the ball to store kinetic energy longer which means more energy is transferred to the pins making them fly around more."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2udj1b,njhcomposer,383,Sun Feb 1 04:36:14 2015 UTC,Holy crap.  I had no idea there was this much science behind bowling.  I didn't even know bowling balls had cores for that matter.  TIL.

There's much more than just what the lens and sensor can do. Adjusting the f-stop for depth of field, exposure and ISO for proper lighting with that f-stop AND to work with the type of motion in your scene.  That's just getting a shot that is properly exposed and has the right amount of elements in focus. Then there's composition, and if it's any type of dynamic scene (involving, say, people) then there's also timing.  I have several friends that shoot e-sports photography, which is a very difficult medium to work in. There's often poor (and changing) lighting (which they have no control over) and extremely dynamic scenes. Getting a great shot that captures the energy and feelings of that moment is REALLY HARD.  Some of those friends get amazingly crappy shots with fairly decent cameras, and then post them all over thinking they're hot shit, because they're not actual photographers and they really aren't trained and can't even tell the difference.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2udj1b,therealflinchy,5,Sun Feb 1 16:01:40 2015 UTC,Within reason. I'm nowhere near a professional level and I can hit the second arrow about 98% of my shots. That's a one inch target. And there are many who are much more accurate than I am.

It also can't be off balance from one side or the other by certain amounts, this is called static weight.  Static weights consist of top, bottom, finger, thumb and side weights. Current USBC specifications allow a maximum 3 oz. of top or bottom weight, and 1 oz. each of side, finger or thumb weight.   Some drilling patterns require you to drill an additional weight hole on the side of the ball to bring it back into regulation.  Every pro shop that drills balls will have a scale to measure these things."

As I mentioned above, knowing how to adjust to the changing oil condition is the game, but a huge part of that adjustment is knowing which bowling ball to use for a given condition.  A PBA bowler will have a dozen or more balls available to him at a tournament, each one drilled a bit differently.  Knowing when to change balls is a very hard thing to learn.  I've been bowling for over 20 years and average 210+ and I still don't have a good grasp on it."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2udj1b,foolishDoughnut,26,Sun Feb 1 09:24:11 2015 UTC,"There's a growing opinion that the unregulated expansion of core/cover-stock technology has ruined the sport.   Basically up until the late 70's everything was more or less the same hard plastic or rubber material,  then in the 80's they made balls out of urethane which made it much easier to throw a hook.  In the early 90's they developed what we call 'reactive resin' which increased the hook potential dramatically and allowed for amateur bowlers to throw insanely high scores (For example, my father had 2 perfect games from 1976 to 1993, he shot 11 of them in the 1994 season alone, roughly a year after the technology was developed and he purchased a Columbia 300 Piranha with a ceramic weight block core and reactive cover-stock).  The American Bowling Congress failed to regulate both ball technology as well as oil paterns in league bowling.  The bowling alleys were allowed to lay down oil paterns where a heavy volume is applied to the middle of the lane while it tapers off and becomes dryer towards the gutters.  Combining this with balls that hook made for a funneling affect, where the bowler could miss his target to the outside and the ball would hit dry boards and begin to hook back earlier, or miss to the middle and hit more oil and skid down further.    This, in my opinion, has lead to the decline of the sport in the last 20 years.  It simply is not that difficult to bowl well anymore"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2udj1b,hellokitty,5,Sun Feb 1 15:25:29 2015 UTC,"On those kinds of oil patterns maybe. I've bowled in a competitive league for 5+ years now, and perfect games are not that common on sport patterns.  Sport patterns aren't designed like the house pattern you describe, where the ball is funneled toward the middle. A bowler has to learn to both read the pattern and be able to find the sweet spot for his ball and throw, and be able to adjust as the pattern shifts during play."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2udj1b,alexbenjaminmorais,6,Sun Feb 1 10:55:32 2015 UTC,"That too, is part of the problem with the decline of the sport, or at least of professional bowling.  You bowl, you know what a sport shot is, most people don't.  Most people see a league bowler average 245 and a pro grind out a 215 on TV and don't understand it.  No amount of blue oil (which is fucking awful and pointless...it looks like a house shot to the naked eye and you can't tell the difference from one pattern to the next) will make it easier to explain.  In golf even a casual observer can see the difference between a par-3 course and Augusta national, in bowling you only see the lane"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2udj1b,woodyallin,3,Sun Feb 1 07:18:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, agreed. Bowling is both a good and a bad spectator sport. Around here there's a actually typically a little audience at games, which is nice as long as they behave. Most of them are however rather interested and well read in the game though."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2udj1b,Look_over_yonder,3,Sun Feb 1 07:23:17 2015 UTC,"It's not a lot different than many other sports. Race car drivers get their cars tuned to match their style, tennis players get specially designed rackets, golf players all have their own clubs.   Maybe a restriction on some of the characteristics of the balls might work but in reality every player bowls differently and the balls need to be made/drilled to compensate. Take a look at YouTube and you'll see just how different the bowling styles are of so many professionals."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,plurality,19,Fri Jan 30 22:05:25 2015 UTC,I think they exist to refuel in the event of an emergency and airforce one needs to stay airborne for a long period of time. Kind of like how the kitchen has enough food for 2000 meals.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,ducksarewet,5,Fri Jan 30 20:28:37 2015 UTC,"I think they exist to refuel in the event of an emergency and airforce one needs to stay airborne for a long period of time.   That's not exactly true. The most the engine is going to be capable of doing is maybe 24 hours of straight flying, at that point most engines will run out of oil. There's a chance Air Force One can stay in the air for 48 or 72 hours because it was engineered that way, but I doubt it - they just need to land at one of the many highly-secured air bases, which we have everywhere across the globe. From an Air Force regulation perspective, I think there's actually a hard limit on 20 hours of flying, which is basically the course B2 bombers make from America."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,fidelitypdx,5,Fri Jan 30 16:16:13 2015 UTC,"This gentleman states that there might be an in-flight oil-replenishment capability on the Airforce One. Aside from the oil-replenishment and food details, and assuming regular in-flight refueling, it would seem that the Airforce One is theoretically capable of two-week-continuous flight-times.  If his credentials are to be believed, I would think he might be correct."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,TheOtherMrSmith,4,Fri Jan 30 23:36:09 2015 UTC,"The problem is that he also, in that same page, says that it's impossible: they don't have 2 weeks worth of water on board. Figure 1 gallon a day, absolutely minimum, per person (100 people minimum). That would be 14,000 pounds of water, with an area of almost 1,800 cubic feet. Then, you need toilets.  I think the reason they have 1000 servings of food is in case they land somewhere, like a military base, that has a shortage of food.   There would be zero strategic advantage to flying in Air Force One compared to being in a nuclear-hardened Air Force bunker, and the majority of Air Force bases have those. Between North America, Asia, and the Middle East, we've got those all over. The President could fly to a military base with ease and be much more protected.  In flight refueling of oil hasn't been done since WW1, AFAIK. The more I thought about it, the less likely it is that Air Force One has purpose-built larger oil reserves on it's engines. It is possible, but from a maintenance perspective, if an engine needed replacing, it would take a lot longer to find a duplicate engine (though, I guess if the modification was simple they could cannibalize parts). I just see it as an unlikely and unrealistic requirement to fly more than 24 hours."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,fidelitypdx,4,Fri Jan 30 16:55:15 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say 0 advantage. It's a lot harder to nuke an airplane.

It's a hell of a lot easier to use any old non-nuclear X-to-air missile etc. to shoot down a plane.   Without a doubt though, Air Force One is equipped with radar jamming, flares, chaff and possibly even kinetic anti-missile counter measures (like the old B52's). I think Air Force One would be one of the most technically challenging aircraft to shoot down with a missile."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,fidelitypdx,2,Sat Jan 31 01:56:57 2015 UTC,"I doubt it, it's a passenger airliner at the end of the day in terms of radar/IR patterns.  The equivalent of any military heavy lifter, at best.  Thing is fucked in any committed engagement with a militia/military.  It's only advantage is its heavy escort and flight path secrecy.  It's a passenger plane with fancy bits,  like an obese woman with nice nails, it doesn't change it that significantly."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,NiceWeather4Leather,2,Sat Jan 31 03:49:48 2015 UTC,"I know from personal experience how the Singapore air force modifies their KC-135s (they have like 3 or 4 of them, and I worked on them in Al Udied). They modified their aircraft with radar deflection paint, heat displacement exhaust cones on the engines, then chaff and flares as final counter-measures. I understand the engine limiters were modified too (the American F108 engines are throttled to something like 60% maximum power, because the engines could rip off of the mountings).   Most aircraft have throttle limits and avionic control limiters to prevent a pilot from doing something too wild that could jeopardize the structural integrity of the aircraft. With those removed, and with a reinforced fuselage and frame, an aircraft can do some pretty crazy stuff. For example, this early 707 doing a barrel roll, the same could be done with a heavily modified commercial jet. I assume Air Force One has those limiters removed because the pilots are highly experienced, so it's likely way more agile, faster, and responsive than any commercially produced aircraft. Certainly it's not an F22 though.   But yeah, in the end, it still has a huge a large radar and heat signature, even if those are modified to be significantly less, and a series of missiles launched at it would bring it down all the same."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,fidelitypdx,3,Sat Jan 31 04:02:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's actually a lot easier to nuke an airplane. You just have it detonate in the low atmosphere (which most ICBMs do these days anyways) and knock out everything for a much wider area. If you think Air Force one might be over Nebraska in 27 minutes, just launch several nuclear weapons at it.  About the only thing an aircraft can do is avoid ground combat and provide mobility. But, realistically, it would be a nation-state going after the President, not foreign terrorists. A nation-state, even a place like Egypt or North Korea or China would have fighter jets they could deploy: 30 incoming fighter aircraft will take down Air Force one.   ... but yeah, I guess it all depends upon the threat model."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,fidelitypdx,2,Sat Jan 31 04:14:10 2015 UTC,"Terrorists probably don't have the capability to take down AF1. Though, I don't think terrorists could storm a bunker either."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,Drendude,2,Sat Jan 31 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"The problem is that this is based on a stock aircraft, you can't modify it too much because that would basically mean flying your president around in a prototype and jets aren't built to fly for days on end, there's a million pieces of engineering going on that are built under the assumption of ""it will only fly for a day or so continiously"".  And why would you? A plane is fragile, and prominent, much better to land and stay in a bunker."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,Todda468,7,Sat Jan 31 23:48:38 2015 UTC,"I worked and flew a lot on KC-135s, it's not farfetched at all. 70% of air force sorties are refueled in flight.   The reason you have 6 assigned is because 2 of those birds could be broken the next time you land and can't make the next leg of the journey. It happens a lot, and sometimes you're grounded for a few days, sometimes a week or more. My aircraft, 61-0306, was manufactured in 1961.  As an example, I had the distinct honor of flying with a US Senator to China for a 3 day mission. We picked the Senator up in Hawaii and then flew straight to China. Upon landing, we had multiple failures in flight instruments. This happens all the time, the air force deployed another bird to pick up the senator and drop off the components we needed, and we spent an extra day fixing the jet. I understand it was pretty awkward explaining our condition to the Chinese authorities, and I'm super glad it wasn't a place like North Korea or Pakistan."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,fidelitypdx,8,Sun Feb 1 00:24:17 2015 UTC,"Knowing a few journalists that have accompanied the President on significant trips abroad, they are also not chartering a 747 just for journalists any more, because news organizations aren't paying for the flight these days. A seat on an overseas charter flight would run the news organization $15,000 or more. It's cheaper to put said journalist in public business class, or have a Wherever Bureau Chief just meet the President when he gets there. If you're not enough in favor of the President or his press secretary to get a seat on AF1, why not buy your own Emirates ticket abroad? The charter flight was very often late compared to AF1 anyway.  Whether the networks pool for a charter flight is a voting arrangement now, and they rarely vote yea.  We don't live in the world of the wire service and typewriters any longer, for better or worse, and the chartered flight following Air Force One went with that world."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,lachryma,7,Sat Jan 31 03:58:41 2015 UTC,"Makes sense once you factor in all of the support aircraft (including backup/decoy Airforce 1) that travel before, during and after a presidential trip -- advance teams, actual presidential travel and then everyone packing up on the way out.  Not to mention that many international trips involve multiple stops. Obama's November Asia trip involved stops in China, Burma and Australia. Lots of gear and personnel moving around in tandem.   The 6 aerial refuelers don't just support Airforce 1; they support the entire presidential airlift group."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,McSchmieferson,2,Sat Jan 31 04:02:57 2015 UTC,"The refuelers are probably stationed at different AF bases around the country/globe. Most AF One trips probably don't need to refuel mid-flight. VC-25s have a range of over 7000 miles, so trips around NA aren't going to need a top-off... just ones that go to other continents."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,sobusyimbored,7,Fri Jan 30 22:28:50 2015 UTC,I remember reading a while ago that they had managed to extend the in air time for Air Force One to 30-34 hours in times of extreme emergency. I'll see if I can find the source.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,fidelitypdx,6,Fri Jan 30 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"I can reasonably see that. I know the KC-135R's F108 engine had a maximum flight time of 24 hours before oil ran out. This was important to know, because the 270,000 of fuel on board could, in theory, keep the aircraft in the air much longer than that. Plus, it was designed to stay in flight for a very long time to support nuclear operations and the bomber fleet. I heard that we were limited to flying only 20 hours in a single mission, which is more than enough to fly half-way around the world. The B2 bomber (which flys usually from Missouri for all of it's missions) had a single mission that was 44 hours (Missouri to Afghanistan and back), which is probably in the top echelon of all-time, longest distance airborne missions."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2u78bo,Todda468,2,Sat Jan 31 03:57:59 2015 UTC,"It's a balance of risks, I'm pretty sure they could but given the plane was designed from the ground up to do <20 hours at a time (longest commmercial flight is 20 hours) it's not something any sane person would do unless there was an emergency."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,curious_netizen,119,Mon Mar 9 10:31:13 2015 UTC,"I love learning about the Kowloon Walled City; it's one of the best pieces of Sci-Fi fuel in history, and it's particularly influential in the cyber-punk genre."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,yayaja67,23,Wed Jan 28 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"No kidding. Check this out.  It's strangely enticing to live somewhere like that, even though it would totally suck in reality. I love cyberpunk cities ala Deus Ex or 5th Element."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,omarfw,18,Wed Jan 28 20:49:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, there is a certain appeal to having that much humanity concentrated in a semi-isolated location. It would be like the hustle and bustle and intensity of a typical city x100.  It would be an exciting place to visit in fiction, but I agree that the reality of it would probably suck.  An MMO game set in a Kowloon-type city might be cool."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,yayaja67,7,Wed Jan 28 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"They're making a Deus Ex mmo, so here's hoping it fulfills my game dreams!"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,omarfw,14,Wed Jan 28 22:56:59 2015 UTC,"Nope, no Deus Ex MMO. That was a misunderstanding on the consumer side of things. It was cleared up as just meaning an expansion to the Deus Ex universe, not any specific game, but a forming of a brand basically."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,Lolita_Humbert,6,Thu Jan 29 00:34:14 2015 UTC,Me too! I could totally see myself living in a city like that multitiered one in Deus Ex: HR. That kind of setting entices me hugely for some reason. In reality I'd probably be mugged and die of the black lung within a month.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,IWillByte,5,Thu Jan 29 05:47:10 2015 UTC,seems likely
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,jonosaurus,3,Thu Jan 29 06:28:38 2015 UTC,I came here with the same thought - mega-city blocks.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,nick_thegreek,2,Thu Jan 29 15:17:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's highly likely.  The towers in the Dredd movie were a lot bigger and there were multiple ones all over the city, but the idea that you had organized crime running a self enclosed city is very similar to Kowloon."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,Camtreez,12,Wed Jan 28 20:02:48 2015 UTC,"A clone of the city makes up the bulk of the setting of The Carlucci Novels by Richard Paul Russo.   Perdido Street Station by China Mieville is heavily influenced by KWC, but the city in the book (New Crobuzon) isn't an exact copy of the city like in the other novel, just built similarly."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,dasqoot,2,Wed Jan 28 20:34:16 2015 UTC,Hey I've actually read Perdido Street! I get what you mean. Is any of China's other stuff any good? I got distracted after Perdido and never went back.   I'll definitely check out the Russo book. Thanks for the tip!
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,Camtreez,5,Wed Jan 28 20:44:40 2015 UTC,That's the only book of his I have read.  You can look at basically anything by Gibson if you want the same general setting.  And of course Snow Crash and The Diamond Age are heavily inspired by KWC's culture but the locations are very different.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tz7hf,dasqoot,2,Thu Jan 29 01:04:26 2015 UTC,Snow Crash and Diamond Age are two of my favorite books of all time. Along with Cryptonomicon and the Baroque Cycle trilogy. Basically anything by Stephenson.

Edit: I'm also not all that concerned about privacy, or security. The only thing of value i own is my computer and i will protect it myself with lethal force if necessary. It would be trivial to bolt it to the floor and set alarms on it, even an offensive defense system.  The only other issue i'd have is ensuring internet access, but assuming we can get any lines into the city (even if we have to ""steal"" it, like i assume they were stealing power) i can set up a local network to provide access wherever needed. Probably easiest to just set up a meshed wireless network from the rooftops with lines out to more routers in the buildings."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ts61p,jdmgto,-3,Tue Jan 27 12:27:28 2015 UTC,That's why these rifles either use flat or very blunt nosed bullets. There are modern polymer tipped bullets for lever actions but in general it's only a problem if you're an idiot.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ts61p,MAD_JIHAD,3,Tue Jan 27 13:42:39 2015 UTC,He means the spring releases and the bullets still in their case fly out the back of the stock. The polymer tipped bullets are a good safety feature to prevent the tip of the bullet from hitting the next bullets primer too hard.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tnut8,frank14752,8,Mon Jan 26 03:00:02 2015 UTC,Thats an air/liquid intercooler. I came here to say that it was interesting that they chose to go that rout vs an air/air intercooler. Reason I say this is because the liquid in those is susceptible to heat soak.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tnut8,JVDS,2,Mon Jan 26 03:19:32 2015 UTC,The new M3/M4 also uses an air to water inter cooler.  The only time it should heat soak is on long track stints and they can have larger radiators for track models. It allows for simpler charge piping and better throttle response.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tnut8,spig,2,Mon Jan 26 07:54:49 2015 UTC,I came to ask the same question.   the intercooler cools air being rammed by the turbo? Doesn't a turbo just use exhaust gas to drive a turbine that drives the turbo compressor? Does that mechanism simply heat the intake air too much?   I don't know much about modern engines or expensive performance stuff like turbos. I only have worked on 50s-60s cars (high school).
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tnut8,jeffdrafttech,2,Mon Jan 26 10:38:17 2015 UTC,"the intercooler cools air being rammed by the turbo? Doesn't a turbo just use exhaust gas to drive a turbine that drives the turbo compressor? Does that mechanism simply heat the intake air too much?   It's not the mechanism that heats the intake air, it's the compression itself -- it's the physics of gases. If you compress something, it heats up. Superchargers have to deal with the same problem."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tnut8,asad137,1 point,Mon Jan 26 14:07:08 2015 UTC,They probably went that way because air-air intercoolers introduce additional turbo lag (that entire volume has to be pressurized before the engine will see full boost).
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tnut8,synaptiq,0,Mon Jan 26 14:07:34 2015 UTC,"Well, you're trying to cool pressurized charge air with 190-210 degree coolant than 75-110 degree ambient air. The coolant has more heat density, but not the temperature difference. Coolant temps are vastly more predictable, but a front mounted intercooler is also vastly more piping prone to leaking (rocking motor vs stable radiator/intercooler.) Personally, I dig the fmic, but to each their own."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tnut8,CiDirkona,2,Mon Jan 26 05:05:00 2015 UTC,"Normally they don't use the same coolant as the engine, so it won't be anywhere near 190* F. It would be a complete separate radiator and pump. That is why it is more expensive than a FMIC but leads to much simpler pressurized piping."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tnut8,spig,1 point,Mon Jan 26 07:49:56 2015 UTC,"In production cars the engine coolant is what's normally used to cool the air charge, it's tuners that will build a separate cooling system for the CAC."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tm1pn,3rdweal,15,Sun Jan 25 13:37:14 2015 UTC,"Source  Imgur album  The Sondergerät 500 Jägerfaust (also often referred to as Jagdfaust, which could be correct too) was a radical weapon, firing heavy 50 mm projectiles vertically into the lower sides of bombers. The system was triggered by an optical system, and the pilot's only task was passing underneath the bomber.   The idea of a gun that throws away a complete barrel with each shot seems crazy at first. Most recoilless guns use A) propellant gas or B) a separate 'counter-projectile' to balance the recoil. But the Germans had stopped building type A guns in 1944 due to their high consumption of propellant and type B would have greatly increased the weight. I expect that a metallurgical analysis would show that both barrels and projectiles are made of soft steel without any of the hardening alloy elements Ni, Cr, Mo, V etc. which were running short in 1945. Also, probably the usual dimensional tolerances were relaxed, since accuracy is not a requirement. So both barrels and shells could be machined rapidly with little tool wear. The substitution of a simple 20mm fuze for the complex AZ 39 safety fuze is another economy measure. The SG 500 barrels were probably shipped already loaded; in this mode the fuze is protected from accidental shocks. So, SG 500 is really a very economical weapon, very well adapted to mass production in an overstrained war economy (unlike most German weapons).   The Jägerfaust is a recoilless weapon. It ejects its barrel downwards to compensate for the upwards firing shell. The system consists of a thin-walled launching tube (dimensions and shape are estimated, no clear information on this part is available), a rifled barrel, a projectile and a charge (all shown in the drawing). The charge is electrically ignited, causing the projectile to move upwards, and the barrel downwards after breaking two pins that held it in position. The rifling of the barrel makes the shell start to spin which results in greater stability in flight. The installation in the Komet consisted of 10 tubes, but exact data is lacking. The installation shown in the drawing is an approximation A normal projectile has both blast and shrapnel effect. A standard 50 mm projectile has 8-10 mm wall thickness for shrapnel effect, and the rest is explosive. The weight ratio of steel to explosive is around 80:20. It is a Minengranate or M-Granate which has considerably thinner walls (2-3 mm), which changes the weight ratio of steel to explosive into 60:40. The shrapnel effect is very limited, but the blast effect is enormous. This is particularly effective on sheet-metal aircraft structures, where the skins would be blown off. M-Granate were also available for nearly all other German calibers between 20 and 88 mm. The concept was taken over by other countries after the war. Grenade weight is 1 kilogram, consisting of 610 grams steel casing and 390 grams explosive. The charge is 513 grams, resulting in a muzzle velocity of 400 m/s."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tccmj,Othais,31,Thu Jan 22 23:20:37 2015 UTC,"Well you guys liked my Nambu post so I thought I'd share this as well.  Here is the youtube video animation.  To explain further:  The Swiss Vetterli was the first military rifle to be adopted as a repeater.  It uses a simple bolt action paired with a tube magazine and elevator feeding system taken from the early Winchester 1866 lever action. The action dates from 1867, but our example here was photographed from a Model 78/81.    The bolt is turned and locked into place thanks to a collar with lugs fitted behind the bolt handle.  While these are not highlighted in the animation, they are present.  For the time this was also rather advanced.  Most conteporary bolt actions simply used the down-turned handle as the lock for the action (rather like a simple door cross bolt) but here we have recessed and symmetrical lugs that more evenly absorb the shock of firing, adding strength to the action.    The action is cocked when the bolt handle is raised.  Helical cuts in the bolt collar cam back on the striker, compressing the firing spring.  Mechanically this is efficient but cock-on-open mechanisms also aid in follow-up shooting as the weight of the spring pressure is already taken up on the unloading stroke.  When a shooter presses the bolt forward there is less resistance and therefor it is less likely to direct his aim off to the left as he presses in.  Ammunition is loaded singulary into a tube running underneath the barrel.  Capacity was generally around 12 cartridges depending on the model.  For brevity we have not fully loaded our virtual rifle.  The elevator is activated by a bell crank which is nested under the bolt.  A groove in the bolt body allows this bell crank to sit undisturbed through most of any push or pull, but at the very end of either stroke the groove ends and the crank is tipped.    The cartridges are .41 rimfire and therefor the firing pin is a floated, two-pronged affair (although we can only see the right side in the animation).  It strikes two sides of the rim to guarantee detonation."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tccmj,xSARGEx117x,4,Thu Jan 22 23:20:42 2015 UTC,Pushing the tips of bullets into the primer end of other bullets seems like a stupid idea.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tccmj,xSARGEx117x,10,Thu Jan 22 23:53:56 2015 UTC,"As someone who has stupidly set a primer off by hand, it takes a lot of force. Much more than you could provide by pushing one into the next."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tccmj,random_geezer,3,Fri Jan 23 00:12:09 2015 UTC,I was hoping for that. But what if you drop the rifle?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tccmj,DilapdilopsPrime,13,Fri Jan 23 01:11:49 2015 UTC,"... a lot of force. You'd have to drop it from a 6 story building at just the right angle, and the slugs would have to be fairly pointed.  If you look at the primer after it's been fired, it has a dent in it from being hit. So the force is enough to dent brass. Lead isn't going to do that easily."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2tccmj,anon-na,2,Fri Jan 23 01:18:37 2015 UTC,"Round nose bullets are recommended for use in tubular mags and spitzers are definitely to be avoided. In fact, there was rifle with a tubular mag with a spiral indentation (I can't remember which one right now) designed to shift the tip of the bullets away from the primer in front of it. You don't have to drop the rifle off a building to set it off - firing it will jolt the bullets sufficiently to do it at least once in a while.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2t22in,mgarv22,2,Wed Jan 21 00:02:46 2015 UTC,Well we use trees for things like tables all the time. Probably would be a similar amount of wood from more trees for a table this long.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2t22in,UnholyOsiris,5,Tue Jan 20 22:50:32 2015 UTC,"As you have discovered, no it is not a single piece ""real tree"". It gives the feel of it being real without the frustration of having to deal with all the problems of one single piece of wood. It is rather a breathtaking piece of craftsmanship. Just a few steps away is their tasting cask of ""Kathryn Hall"" Cabernet Sauvignon, which was a wonderful treat to appreciate while in this stunning setting. If you have an opportunity while in Napa Valley, stop in to see Hall. You'll know you are there when you see the rabbit from the road."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2syzz1,Plethorian,29,Mon Jan 19 20:29:36 2015 UTC,What's the stuff floating on top and sunk to the bottom of the liquid?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2syzz1,lagninja,30,Mon Jan 19 21:09:08 2015 UTC,You may find this wiki-page helpful.  TLDR: it's a layer of yeast that helps seal the sherry-wine from other bacterium and yeast that could spoil the wine during the aging process.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2syzz1,soloxplorer,21,Mon Jan 19 21:15:03 2015 UTC,"It's not quite for that. Once the grape juice is inoculated with yeast and the alcohol starts increasing, it's unlikely to get infected with something else.  The layer of flor is to prevent oxidation. Sherries were the flor remains intact tend to be lighter in color and taste crisper. When the flor is broken up, there is more oxidation and the wine is darker and nuttier.   See fino and oloroso."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2syzz1,markovich04,6,Tue Jan 20 02:33:52 2015 UTC,"Fermentation is an anaerobic process. The yeast is sealed because yeast excretes CO2 during the fermentation process and the air can only get out one way, through an airlock at the top. This deprives the barrel of oxygen, killing all the aerobic bacteria, and makes it a positive-pressure (basically sealed) environment, preventing anything from getting in.   You kill the anaerobic bacteria by cleaning the shit out of everything with sanitizer."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2syzz1,beancounter2885,3,Tue Jan 20 05:13:12 2015 UTC,"The top is called krausen and the bottom is called trub. The top is the yeast actually fermenting, throwing off CO2, which is forming bubbles. The bottom is the yeast after it eats all it can. It clumps together and sinks in a process called flocculation. This is an artificially chosen trait."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2syzz1,beancounter2885,1 point,Tue Jan 20 05:09:54 2015 UTC,"Some of it is potassium tartrate, aka cream of tartar. It's a source of tartaric acid, one of the stronger acid molecules we humans can get our hands on easily. Wine aging barrels used to be a major source of it for the early chemical industry."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2syzz1,best_of_badgers,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:41:00 2015 UTC,"I make mead at home, and I've never seen the layer of yeast on top like that.  I assume it happens more with certain kinds of ferment, like wine?  During any ferment, though, you'll see a sediment of yeast on the bottom.  The yeasty dregs of a ferment make for a great soup base!  They've got a good savory flavor."

It is a HUGE universe with a ridiculous amount of lore to it. So if you want to learn about it be prepared for that.   Its really awesome though. There are dozens and dozens of novels set in the universe,  and each rule book for the different armies is basically a mini lore book too. There's also a super detailed wiki which is probably the best place to start if you're interested .   I havnt even mentioned the starship-troopers ""bug""-like tyrannids, who are invading the milky way from another galaxy,  and have giant living starships,  and a race of bug that can literally steal the dna of humans and live amongst them.   Or the orcs. Kind've a mix of comic relief and classic tolkien orc. They name thier weapons things like ""choppas"" and ""shootas"" and paint their vehicles red ""coz red goez fasta"" but they're actually a weird mix of animal and fungus,  they reproduce through fungal spores and gestate underground,  and are born with full knowledge of how to build their tech (they were actually created by a long dead galaxy-spanning ancient civilisation to be the ""perfect warriors"")   Then theres the eldar, basically"" space elves"" (created by the same ancient civilisation as the orcs)  and the tau,  who are a young utopian communist-like society who humans encountered a couple of thousand years ago when they were just figuring out fire and the wheel,  and have now developed technology almost as advanced as humans, and since they know how it works,  will soon surpass humankind since technological advancement is impossible for humans now.   The necrons.  Basically the definition of ""an ancient evil awakens"" robot skeleton zombies that have been sleeping for millions of years and have just woken up. (that long dead ancient civilisation? Yeah,  thats them. Tricked by the ""old gods"" into giving up thier flesh and becoming robot slaves)   Not to mention the fact that hell literally exists in this universe.  And faster than light travel is only possible by travelling through ""the warp"" which is a parallel dimension filled with literal demons and gods. Who ocassionally invade the real world through rifts in reality.   Then of course the space marines,  who are an ultra zealous religious army of genetically engineered super warriors who posses some of the genes of the god-emporer.  There's also an awesome backstory about the god-emporer with a lot of parallels to the bible,  where the emporer created ""sons"" who were basically demigods,  but the forces of chaos got wind of it and scattered them throughout the galaxy and he had to go and find them,  and each one became the genetic basis for each ""chapter"" of the space marines. Then one of them got possessed by ""chaos"" (demons from the warp) betrayed him and mortally wounded him and hes been basically a living corpse for thousands of years,  hooked up to a massive life support mechanism on earth and guiding the human race with his psychic beacon ""the astonomicion"" which is the only way human pilots can find thier way when travelling through ""the warp"".

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,dreyco,8,Sun Jan 18 20:01:17 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculous. One thing I've always appreciated about the Black Library (the company that publishes all Games Workshop related novels) is that in the UK they're exceptional value for money, when it comes to a good paperback read. I buy their omnibus editions (normally at least three novels plus short stories and perhaps other things) and they cost at most £9.99, and that's in a physical store.   Eisenhorn (and Dan Abnett's other Inqusitor novels; I personally favour the Ravenor trilogy) are great starting suggestions. They're some of the few 40k novels that go outside the military sci-fi mould (they move between space opera, conspiracy thriller and investigative fiction, among other things) and they actually explore something of what the day to day existence of people in the Imperium of Man is like, which is refreshing, as it's often something that gets left out of a lot of the lore. They were originally created to support the game Inquisitor, one of the many abandoned 'specialist games' Games Workshop has tossed to one side that are actually more interesting than their core product."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,Tokeli,5,Mon Jan 19 01:55:29 2015 UTC,"I've only ever read one. ""Inquisitor"" by ian watson. Its the first in a trilogy and was the first ever 40k novel. It follows a human inquisitor and his ships crew as he hunts heretics. First tyrannid ""gene stealers"" and then the demons of chaos.   Its a bit confusing and heavy going,  especially for someone with no previous knowledge of the lore. But Its still an awesome book and might be a good introduction. Though i would suggest getting a basic understanding of the world from the wiki first. I got most of my lore from the rulebooks,  (called ""codexes"") . You can probably find pirated pdfs of them.  They're full of awesome short stories that give cool glimpses into the universe"

There's a ton of weird shit in the book and it's pretty much been retconned out.  IMO Gaunt's Ghosts, or Ravenor are the best series. Dan Abnett is a genuinely compelling writer.  Eisenhorn is also super excellent"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,LeCorsairFrancais,2,Mon Jan 19 17:58:44 2015 UTC,"Eisenhorn is great, like Dreyco said.  There's a series called Gaunt's Ghosts, which I think is a better portrayal of how hopeless and screwed up the 40k universe is.  Either one is good to start with, and they're both written by, in my opinion, the best author for 40k.  After those, I recommend the series Horus Heresy, which is about how the Imperium of Man became the backwards excuse for a civilization it is now.  40k is easily my favorite setting, it's simply cool."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,corporateswine,3,Mon Jan 19 00:22:51 2015 UTC,Whats the relationship between Warhammer 40k and standard Warhammer? Is normal Warhammer in the same universe ?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,ASS__TITTIES,6,Sun Jan 18 20:56:48 2015 UTC,"That's up for debate: it was once canon that the Warhammer Fantasy (WHFB) world was a pocket universe within the Warhammer 40k (WH40k) one, created as a breeding ground for warriors. 'The Old Ones', an ancient race of gods, started by creating the Lizardmen to be their servants (who continue to follow instructions left behind by the old ones) and a series of 'gates' around the world with which to travel (centred on the poles - remember that part). Then they created the other races, finishing with Ogres and Halflings (basically hobbits), who are both characterised by unending hunger. But, the Chaos gods from that void you heard about in WH40k got wind of this and wanted in. They were able to penetrate the bubble universe through those portals on the poles - which is why the poles are now the 'Chaos Wastes', from where the forces of Chaos (everything from giant demons Norse cults) try to raid the rest of the world.   There is some suggestion the Orcs were not put their intentionally by the Old Ones, but that they slipped through by mistake. Additionally, in early editions, there were some 'magical weapons' that were simply WH40k weapons that had become lost in the void and fallen through.  Anyway, GW now downplays any link between the lores - and this story can be ignored for all practical purposes. Especially since no one in either world (well, maybe Lord Kroak, but probably not even him) know about this connection."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,NoNadir,3,Sun Jan 18 21:16:17 2015 UTC,"What would the advantage of penetrating this world be for the forces of chaos be, why bother?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,ASS__TITTIES,5,Sun Jan 18 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"Partly because the world the Old Ones were creating was one of perfect order - forces of Chaos/forces of order. Partly because they wanted in on that sweet, sweet, army-breeding planet. Partly because they just want to corrupt souls. And partly because the Old Ones were using some powerful shit to carve continents, a planet, and even a universe, and they wanted a slice."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,NoNadir,2,Sun Jan 18 21:27:41 2015 UTC,Never knew this. Thats awesome. I wish GW would expand on this idea instead of quash it
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,flyonthwall,2,Sun Jan 18 22:07:02 2015 UTC,"I know right! It came up a fair bit in 3rd ed., but they totally ignore it now. Thing is, the WHFB world really wouldn't count for much in 40k, it doesn't have the production of even the smallest Imperium hive worlds. Plus, the lores have drifted: what with the 'winds of magic' and so on. I still like it though, every good fantasy world needs a good creator-god(s) story."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,NoNadir,2,Sun Jan 18 22:18:18 2015 UTC,"Well, they do still keep a tacit connection between the worlds; the Chaos Daemon armies have always been interchangeable to a lesser or greater extent between both products. This goes way back to the Realm of Chaos sourcebooks, which are worth having for the fluff and the artwork alone, some of the best stuff GW has ever done, which contained some (in retrospect quite insane) rules which essentially bridged not only Warhammer and 40k but Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay together so that elements from each game could be used in the others, connected through the agency of Chaos. The best part of this, probably, was the ludicrous random mutation and chaos gift tables for Chaos champions and chosen ones, which could (if you were really lucky with the dice, we're talking D1000 tables) end up with (for example) Khorne deciding to give a Chaos champion from the Warhammer fantasy world the gift of a weapon from the 40k universe. With infinite ammunition. This includes things like lascannons."

Inquisitors, which are exactly what their name implies, hunt down heresy and have the authority to burn entire planets if they deem the populace of that planet are heretics.   That could mean one farmboy that found a Tau Pulse Rifle in his garden, or a brothel that got a little too interested in hedonism to the point they get 'poisoned' by the Chaos God Slanesh (the God of indulgence. Think bright colours, heavenly music, irresistibly delicious food, basically over-indulgence of all of your senses), or it could be as simple as an Imperial Guardsman that questions his suicidal orders. An Inquisitor would burn an entire planet for less.   Basically, Humanity under the Imperium are backwards. They consider their technology magic, they literally worship the Machine Gods to ensure the smooth running of their tanks, planes and guns."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,Tokeli,2,Sun Jan 18 22:55:43 2015 UTC,"An inquisitor could glass an entire planet for something as incredibly minor as that, but once word reached the closest bastion of the Inquisition, he'd damn well be hunted down for it and questioned, at the least.

Humanity recovers, and then a brief civil war utterly ruins that recovery. More knowledge is lost, and the main repositories of mechanical knowledge, on Mars, are destroyed and corrupted and twisted. Over 10,000 years, innovation turns into heresy, and great care and importance is put on how to manufacture, maintain, and repair the technology humanity does have. The procedures eventually turn into religious rites in and of themselves, and to attempt something new or to deviate is a grave sin for all but a few.  The Holy Grail Beyond Anything Conceivable for the Mechanicus (the technology-based society on Mars) is to find a specific kind of computer from before the dark age. Deployed on new colonies as a repository for EVERY bit of knowledge you'd need to survive on a new world, finding a complete and working one would change everything. I think they'd go as far as to goddamned blast Terra and half the Imperium into dust if it meant getting their hands on one.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,bran_dong,6,Sun Jan 18 19:54:14 2015 UTC,"Why Emperor poop? Because its the concentrated souls of 10,000 psykers every day. So the effects it has on psykers and warp beings in general is devastating. Sort of a massive overload of null energy if I remember right."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,flyonthwall,5,Sun Jan 18 19:57:36 2015 UTC,how is his poop concentrated soul? is he fed living people?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,bran_dong,12,Sun Jan 18 20:21:51 2015 UTC,"..... Actually yes.  The astronomicion,  the psychic beacon he projects into the warp,  which is essential to the survival of the imperium because it is the only way to navigate in the warp and therefore travel at FTL,  USED to be powered by his mind alone. But since he was almost killed and is now only half alive,  they have to use humans with psychic powers to ""boost the signal"".  I cant remeber the number but its something lile 30,000 psykers a day are plugged into the astronomicion,  and promptly die from having their minds totally fried from all the psychic energy  Ps i dont think were talking about literal poop.  More like the souls of all those dead psykers. Which is essentially the emporers ""poop""  since he basically ate their minds to power his beacon"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2su8ms,flyonthwall,3,Sun Jan 18 20:32:56 2015 UTC,so this gives him super-poop? being the emperor sounds horrifying ....they should let him die.

Theres a heavy implication that killing the emporer is the only way to save the human race from this never ending cycle of fucked-upness. It would separate every human colony from eachother and theyd all basically have to start civilisation over again from scratch,  but considering how fucked up their civilisation is, thats kindve what they need at this point.   also the astronomicion is probaby what is attracting the tyrannids to the milky way,  and considering they've probably already completely overrun several other galaxies,  turning it off is probably the only way to save the entire galaxy from becoming bug food  There is a rogue space marine called cypher whos life mission is to get to the emporer and kill him because he realises its the only way to save humankind. Theres also clues that the emporer himself realises this and is actively trying to help cypher,  because he knows he needs to die too."

I got curious and searched, and apparently the Grey Knights' use rounds that just have concentrated, negative psychic energy.  The Emperor isn't fed people, but instead those people (powerful psykers) are sacrificed to power the gigantic navigation beacon that is the only thing that allows humanity to have interstellar travel. Kept in a quasi-undead state by a monstrous life support machine, he's alive enough to use his mind to control and guide the beacon, but he's too weak to power it.  When he was alive, he could power it himself from halfway across the galaxy while fighting a war. Now, ten thousand die a day (and they apparently each power it for months, so there's a LOT of them there) just to keep it running.

Well, the light said dirty after like a few days, I figured it was just bullshit. I've been using the same filter for a few months, and I knew it was about time to actually change it.

Water filtering can have the downside of removal of healthy, naturally occurring minerals in water  When stripped of these trace minerals, it can actually be unhealthy for the body.  Usually this is from Reverse Osmosis filters though.  I don't recall charcoal filters having too many downsides.  (Although an extreme comparison: distilled water.

I never noticed that they had a gimmicky whole house filtration system put on it.   It basically has a two stage filtration, which is typical - a particulate filter followed by a charcoal filter.   The gimmick is in the following- the charcoal filter is a tank about the size of a whole house water softener tank that's completely full of charcoal. That tank has a gimmicky system on it that automatically flushes water through the charcoal every few days.   Well, it hadn't been serviced in over 10 years, so it was nasty inside of the filter cartridge and tank. They even  had the sprinkler water being filtered, which is ridiculous, and grossly shortens the time between servicing.   Filter started out as white: http://i.imgur.com/4qud43E.jpg The whole system: http://i.imgur.com/hKWBGZn.jpg?1 Someone taking the system apart to show what's inside: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je41o-cjQAo  I've seen comments on the net from folks paying more than $3000 dollars for this gimmicky filtration system.   I was working out of town, so only getting sick while I was at home, and didn't catch on until I was no longer working out of town. I had a few months of getting sick off and on, and then sick most of the time when I was no longer traveling out of town."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2srym1,Triviaandwordplay,2,Sun Jan 18 01:34:57 2015 UTC,"Why are they ""gimmicky""? They work, but obviously not if they weren't serviced for decades."

For $3000+, you could buy dozens and dozens of smaller charcoal filters - fresh ones, not keep rinsing used charcoal, and no way it's doing a thorough rinsing of the charcoal, either, it can't.   Solid charcoal is also a thing now, it's superior to bits of charcoal.   The routine flushing is also a waste of water."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2srym1,I_LOVE_MOM,1 point,Sun Jan 18 20:09:51 2015 UTC,"You have literally no idea what you're talking about.   I work for an environmental remediation company. I don't sell these, but I do have to work with systems like this. They're usually put in place if a home has well water and there is contamination (usually leaks from nearby gas stations) in the groundwater. I take water samples from before it goes through the system, a mid point, and after it's treated and then send them to a laboratory to be analyzed. It is literally the difference between having gasoline constituents in your water versus having water that is safe to drink. Just because you don't believe in them doesn't mean they're ""unnecessary nonsense"" or that they are ineffective. Again, if the system hasn't been serviced in 10 years, obviously it's not going to be doing it's job properly. I have no idea why you think your experience with one you stated wasn't properly kept up with is the rule and not the exception.   Which would be a major deal with this system, and likely at a cost of a couple hundred dollars, at least.   Well, it's not really a major deal, it's just a function of how they work. Also, whoever is responsible for the contamination in the first place is usually the party that will foot the bill for carbon changes. If someone has this system in place just because they wanted their water filtered more than normal (and not due to well/groundwater contamination), then yeah, they would be on the hook for whatever that cost is. You don't buy a car then get flustered and upset when you have to change your oil, do you?   For $3000+, you could buy dozens and dozens of smaller charcoal filters   What do you think is going to be more cost effective: buying dozens and dozens of small charcoal filters or one large scale filter that doesn't need to be replaced every couple of weeks? Are you going to Brita filter your shower?   To summarize: No, I don't sell these but I do have to sample them and the results we get back don't mesh with the bullshit you're spouting."

This was my first ever sci-fi artwork commission & I had to produce 3 successive audition pieces for DK/Lucasbooks to get the job back in 2000. I worked with the editor John Kelly and the author Curtis Saxton in devising the concept and content of the interior. To address some of the points raised:  1.The concept we worked to was that the rebels excavated an existing ancient pyramid and filled it with their own tech including turbo lifts - the stairs would have been a b!tch. 2.The transports accessed the basement through the large corridor seen in the bottom right of the image. My preliminary drawings of this artwork were of the surface entrance to this tunnel but there wasn't room in the spread for this potential vignette artwork to see the light of day. 3. Yes that satellite dish does look like a Gramophone. My bad.  The original is currently hanging on the wall behind me. I'll be posting high res images of all my Star Wars artworks this year & the originals will be available to view at an exhibition of all my published work ( Serenity, Alien etc ) in London this summer.

They arn't gross or anything it is just you starting to see the size of what happend. I remember standing infront of them having tears in my eyes.   Question though: you didn't show the picture with the hair. Is it bacause you didn't saw it or does it has another reason. For me it had together with the shoes by far the most impact. That why I am wondering.  To explain a little bit for 67 and 79: These are only chimneys from the houses where they used to live, not gas-chambers. It was to exensive to preserve all houses but let the chimneys there. You can see the acctualy cambers in 58-62. The germans blew them about 2 monthes before they lost the war."

It's definitely not 'steam' either, as steam implies water vapor, and vaporized e-juice is not water.  The modern e-cig is still basically the same as the diagram. You have a battery and a heating element. The heating element is wetted with e-juice through a variety of methods, and then heat is applied until the liquid starts atomizing off of the heating element. The user draws air through the atomizing chamber and inhales the vapor produced."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2si0ic,schmucubrator,11,Thu Jan 15 16:59:01 2015 UTC,"close, it's to represent the draw of hot air produced in the fire, which goes through the tubes in the boiler, heating the water around those tubes and boiling it to steam, the steam then goes up into the dome before being regulated through a valve (controlled by the driver) and directed to the cylinders, valves located in the cylinder are controlled by a series of rods attached to the wheels and redirect the steam like so, driving the wheels around (you need at least two cylinders for this), when the steam in the cylinder has been used it gets exhausted through the funnel, this creates a vacuum (and the instantly recognisable 'chuff'), drawing more hot air with it and thus repeating the process in the span of mere milliseconds.  put simply, everything in a steam locomotive effects everything else one way or another. The harder a steam locomotive works, the hotter the fire will burn because more air is getting drawn through the boiler. It a brilliant system that was perfected right at the start of the history of steam locomotive and remained that way ever since, with minor improvements such as superheaters (almost like the steam engine's equivalent of a supercharger) and improvements with maintenance"

They start in the Creation Room where the story of the creation of the earth is taught, then they go to the Garden of Eden Room on the bottom right where the fall and expulsion of Adam and Eve are taught, then they go to the Telestial Room on the middle left that symbolises the earth after the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden, then from there they go to another room (called Terrestrial Room) that is a bit nicer and receive more teachings, and in the end they will end up in the Celestial room (middle right) that symbolises being in God's presence."

Baptisms for the dead are in case you don't get baptized but change your mind after you die. Part of Mormon belief is that after you die, you go to a kind of spirit waiting room where missionary ghosts tell you about Mormonism and you get that last chance to convert and go on to one of the three heavens (once somebody gets baptized for your body) or go to the Mormon equivalent of hell. Once you're already dead and in that place, though, it seems like an easy choice.  Source: my family was Mormon when I grew up. That shits cray."

If you want to go to outer darkness you need to know God perfectly and then choose to reject him actively -- it's literally impossible for almost everyone and does not align with the common conception of hell. The closest equivalent of hell (eternal punishment for bad people/those who don't accept Jesus) in LDS doctrine is the telestial kingdom. Most religions have nothing that equates to outer darkness in terms of entry criteria, so describing it as hell isn't a helpful way to understand the concept."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,drmacinyasha,7,Wed Jan 14 22:48:26 2015 UTC,"Requiring almost every boy to be in scouts waters it down. They tend to move through the program quickly, and in a different manner than other troops.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,klaruz,3,Wed Jan 14 23:04:33 2015 UTC,"I grew up in the church and I always resented that scouting was implemented into the Mutual program. The girls every week would just get together and do girly shit each week, but nah, the guys had to do Boy Scouts. I was never interested in scouting in the least. I love the outdoors and camping and everything scouting stands for, but doing that stuff officially through the ranks just wasn't for me.  To this day I'm not sure why it's still integrated. It's not really good for both sides. It dilutes the actual program, which is unfortunate for the people that are into it (as you mentioned), and it's a lot of unnecessary pressure for Mormon kids who don't want to do it, which just causes resentment. I'm still an active member and I enjoy the church, but it certainly wasn't because I was compelled to do Boy Scouts. Never did get my Eagle and I still don't really regret it, to be honest, since you can pretty much get your Eagle just by going through the motions."

Very few people actually qualify for the housing and even fewer are accepted. There are also work requirments to recieve housing which needless to say most homeless people aren't going to qualify for.

The stone came from a nearby quarry. It's massive (over 250,000 square feet). The walls are ~10 feet thick at the bottom but thinner up top due to weight.   There is also a lot of symbolism in the temples.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,CultZero,15,Thu Jan 15 13:32:09 2015 UTC,"A ""lot"" of symbolism is really subjective, though. Mormon design in general pales in comparison to high church experiences like the Catholics or Episcopals-- pales in everything from Sunday service to massive stone buildings.  After a 45 minute wait and walking from one end of Temple Square to the other, I wasn't able to find a single person who would explain why the big dipper was on the side of the Salt Lake Temple.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,MrJake10,3,Thu Jan 15 15:51:41 2015 UTC,"Here is an article on the symbols.   Big Dipper  The Big Dipper is an easily overlooked feature of the west center tower of the Salt Lake Temple. Small stars forming the shape of the Big Dipper can be seen high on the tower, above two Sun Stones, and the All-Seeing Eye Stone.  The Big Dipper has historically been a way of orient one's self when lost. Its presence represents the lessons taught in the temple and the eternal direction they give to life. Further, the symbol of the big dipper on the temple is oriented to find the actual North Star when standing in front of the temple. Follow an imaginary line formed by the last two stars of the cup of the dipper. This leads one to the actual North Star in the sky."

Sandstone had been used for some of the foundation, and when they uncovered it after the army left, found that the sandstone had already begun fracturing.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,randomhumanuser,2,Thu Jan 15 14:38:15 2015 UTC,"all the rooms are open to the public for the tour. I think it is a 1-2 week period. After that, it is for Mormons only. So you can't go in and watch the ceremonies, but they explain what they do in each room as you walk through and you can ask questions about it. you can ask questions about it any time, there is even a website for it. the church likes to say ""it isn't secret, it's sacred."" I can agree with that. there isn't anything weird. no animal sacrifice, no naked virgins, no wailing and thrashing on the ground, nothing like that."

Not sure if they still do that.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,istherenootherway,0,Thu Jan 15 15:38:37 2015 UTC,Errrr if you are Mormon then you constantly hear about Jesus being the perfect example. Following him should be the number 1 priority in every aspect of your life. Would Jesus want you to build a billion dollar mall? From what I have read about him I think that would be close to the bottom of the list.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,beardpunch,1 point,Thu Jan 15 13:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, following his example, not restricting your actions to only that which he praised. He never said anything about cell phones. Does that make it bad to use one? Jesus is the perfect example of how to live your life in principle. Leaders of the church probably think that building a mall bring in more money than just investing that money, and with greater returns they can do more good like humanitarian aid. I'm sure the end goal is still following Christ's teachings."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,alyak72,0,Thu Jan 15 19:34:16 2015 UTC,"As we know, the churches humanitarian aid has worked out as a few dollars per member per year which is pitiful in the grand scheme of things. Again from what I have read about Jesus, making sure people can get to the porche design shop and Tiffany's would not be in his list of priorities.  Following Christ's teachings would have been to build hospitals and schools, immunise kids, help the poor and homeless that sort of thing. A great and spacious mall with a retractable roof with a stream running through it is laughable and I can point you to a lot of scriptures about costly apparel and fine clothes as well. Oh and regarding not using tithing and only previous investments, where did the church get the money from to make those investments..................  I don't know how members can defend the mall and have any knowledge of christs teachings. Not with a straight face anyway."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,Mr_Strangelove_MSc,16,Thu Jan 15 01:39:00 2015 UTC,All temple ordinances are required to go to the celestial kingdom. In order to get a temple recommend you must be a full tithe payer.

So they were right in a way.  No need to get defensive about it the fact that you need to pay money to be a mormon in good standing. It was always taught to me to be a sign of obedience to god which isn't really a bad thing if that's what you believe in."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,akambe,1 point,Thu Jan 15 12:57:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's a tithe, not a set amount, so it's all relative. It's about sacrifice, IMO. And it's what the member considers a tithe. You could literally pay $0, tell the bishop that it's your full tithe, and he'd have to accept that. The only guidance the church gives on it is that it's considered ""10% of your increase,"" and that can be interpreted so many ways.  Nobody checks your paychecks or your W2s or asks you declare what your salary or investment dividends are. You are asked, ""Are you a full tithe payer?"" and there ya go."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,istherenootherway,1 point,Thu Jan 15 01:06:15 2015 UTC,It was always taught to me to be 10% of gross income or whatever you can afford if 10% is too much. You can tell your bishop you are paying full tithe and only pay 5% because you think it's fair but if you were to actually tell him you are paying 5% and didn't have some sort of hardship to justify it I can't imagine he wouldn't lecture you about tithing. Having a guilty conscience doesn't seem like it'd jive with trying to get into super heaven.

If you legitimately didn't make money fair enough but if you try and tell me you have paid a full tithe and have not paid a penny then you can get fucked. Remember the bishopric doing the interviews are the ones checking the tithing coming in each week so we have a damn good idea what you are and what you are not paying."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,dkeate,0,Thu Jan 15 16:15:00 2015 UTC,"This temple was finished in 1893 (before Utah was even a state). The church was probably disproportionately wealthy for churches of its size at the time because of the rather steep tithing they make members pay but Salt Lake only had a population of 45,000 at the time and half of them weren't even mormon and it was still very much a frontier territory. The Mormon church has billions now but at the time they were still quite small."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,KloverCain,1 point,Thu Jan 15 00:49:36 2015 UTC,"That's a multi-purpose ""assembly room,"" used for large meetings. In earlier days, it was used for general meetings and instruction. Sometimes, as I understand it, a lot of church leadership meets there. Other times, even a stake conference (gathering of membership of the rough equivalent of a diocese), just regular church members. I don't think it's used as much these days as in the early days of the church in Utah. Only a handful of modern temples have these large assembly rooms."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sftd1,chich311,2,Thu Jan 15 16:07:42 2015 UTC,"Yup. Mormon belief being that baptism is required to attain the highest heavenly reward, and if people die without having had the opportunity, Mormons don't feel they should be damned because of bad timing/geography. So, members are baptized by proxy for the dead, and the dead can accept or reject the ordinance. So they're not ""becoming members of the church"" in any way, just the necessary ordinance is being done in their behalf."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sa0xq,not-quite-obscure,34,Tue Jan 13 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"To make a foil ball, you roll the foil up into a ball.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sa0xq,iLurk_4ever,10,Tue Jan 13 15:24:10 2015 UTC,Maybe they had the most pressure on them and popped out after being disturbed by the machining and stuff.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sa0xq,chovey,2,Wed Jan 14 03:04:33 2015 UTC,Maybe he quit for a bit of time during those periods but kept playing with the ball so those bits got really compressed or something along those lines.

I'm not sure what the weight of the foil* would be, but it can't be much, so the ball must represent tons of packs.   Edit: *each individual foil sheet"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sa0xq,realpigasus,3,Tue Jan 13 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"Sure it can, I would think. Easily over 10 pounds. It's half paper and half aluminum foil (unless he peeled/burned the paper off) in which case it's even heavier.   Just did the basic math. For a round stock of 2200 alloy (most likely what they use I would think), 12"" round and 12"" long, it would be 135 pounds. This ball looks to be around ~16"" wide, so I'm guessing it's easily over 10 pounds, since actual al. stock that size would weigh over 300 pounds.  Factor in about ~33% less from the fact it's round stock and not a sphere, you'd get 200 pounds if it was solid. So, that ball most likely weighs upwards of 50 pounds assuming there is a lot of 'air' trapped in it, otherwise it would weigh close to 324 pounds.  Edit: I did some crappy math here. A 12"" sphere has a volume of 907.8 inches3. Aluminum alloy 2202 has a density of 1.6 ounces per cubic inch. That gives us 90 pounds. If we go with a 16"" sphere, 2144.6 inches3, it comes out to 216 pounds.  Assuming solid and no vacant space or trapped air (or pieces of paper)."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sb658,stepawayfromthegirl,5,Tue Jan 13 19:08:19 2015 UTC,This was attemperator piping carrying 700 PSI steam. it was undersized and you can see where the pipe and fitting has been eroded as the steam turned the corner at the elbow.  workers (it was part of a power plant) had just left the area when the pipe gave way. had they been there when it burst there would have been fatalities.  Edit: it's been a while. actually 780 degree water which is about 1200 psi.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sb658,olithraz,2,Tue Jan 13 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"The steam was going from left to right, correct?  What blew out? A joint or straight section?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sb658,clush,3,Wed Jan 14 08:46:38 2015 UTC,That is correct. You can see where the steam begins to wire draw the elbow at it begins it's turn. You can also see massive erosion of the pipe on the downstream side of the elbow (should look like the upstream side). The pipe burst just past the elbow.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sb658,clush,1 point,Wed Jan 14 13:15:06 2015 UTC,"I believe you meant corroded, not eroded. Erosion is specific to geology where soil/rock is displaced; Corrosion is the chemical destruction of a material.  Source: I do industrial water treatment. (Gotta get some water treatment in that steam line!)"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sb658,TheTrueAlphaSeal,2,Thu Jan 15 03:45:06 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that the pipe was eroded due to excessive steam velocity in the pipe since the pipe was grossly undersized. this is not due to chemical attack, it is due to small particulates carried by the steam abrading the pipe. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion_corrosion"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sb658,tyrick,1 point,Thu Jan 15 13:28:48 2015 UTC,"If metal corroded, it's explicitly due to a chemical reaction (that's what corrosion is). If it's from a power plant, the steam is generated by a boiler, no? If so, there shouldn't be any ""particulate"" - the only thing coming out should be the water treatment (if any) and steam. If other stuff is coming out (called carryover), the boiler isn't operating properly."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2sb0dj,wollington,1 point,Thu Jan 15 01:14:51 2015 UTC,"I think the point was you didn't need to, when you cock the gun you want it to be fired quick so a sensitive trigger is a good thing. and when you carry it it would not be cocked, as it would ware out the spring, easily go off and just be pointless without a different design and safety lock.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2s2sbw,3rdweal,3,Mon Jan 12 00:41:38 2015 UTC,"It's made for intercepting relatively soft targets light fast attack boats.  13 grains of tungsten travelling at 2,000 feet per second carries about the same energy of a .22LR projectile at the muzzle - and since tungsten is harder and 70% more dense than lead, it will lose velocity at a lower rate and penetrate much deeper.  9,000 such projectiles from each shell would make very short work of these kind of boats currently fielded by Iran for example."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2s2sbw,CiDirkona,15,Mon Jan 12 03:36:30 2015 UTC,"Shoot this thing at the bad guys. Instead of most one round hitting something and breaking it, it explodes on/near the bad guys, sending out hundreds of smaller projectiles to break lots on things/people. The brass part in the back stays in the gun, the cord things are what burns to launch the front thingy out of the barrel of the gun."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2s2sbw,3rdweal,5,Mon Jan 12 04:26:51 2015 UTC,"Also worth pointing out that the explosion does not actually add energy to the projectile, it just bursts the shell open.  The balls do their damage from what's left of the kinetic energy imparted on them when they collectively left the barrel of the gun as part of the shell."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2s2sbw,CiDirkona,10,Mon Jan 12 07:01:29 2015 UTC,"In the projectile itself, the front brass tip is probably the timer/fuze/detonator, the tube down the middle carries the flame down to the back of the projectile where it's explosive charge is."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2s2sbw,BigBlackBert,7,Sun Jan 11 19:43:11 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's what I was mostly confused about. That explodes which then frees all the balls... Right?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2s2sbw,CiDirkona,5,Sun Jan 11 19:53:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the balls don't explode from the big projectile until it gets near / at the target. The brass timer/fuze can usually adjusted to change the distance/time when the projectile explodes. Say the enemy is 2000 feet away, and the projectile travels at 1000 feet per second, set it to go off at 1.8 seconds after firing to cover a larger area with the balls."

So when you left the ship you didn't take your passport, rather you couldn't take your passport. However, the card you use to check in and out of the ship acts as an ID card.

That doesn't even include the inflatable life rafts, which are not shown in this illustration.  Most of the crew are assigned to these in an emergency, but even then, most ships have double the number needed for the crew.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2rvorp,Unidoon,4,Sat Jan 10 10:43:31 2015 UTC,That's exactly correct. Most wide angle lenses have distortion at the far end of the picture. That lens produces next to none of that.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2rvorp,msnyder622,2,Sat Jan 10 14:01:21 2015 UTC,No idea honestly. I imagine Nikon makes a modern version of it.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2rvorp,Cypher_Aod,2,Sat Jan 10 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"with the ultra-high-end lenses from that time period, they were usually produced by hand-grinding the lenses in an extremely exhaustive process of grinding, polishing, checking the distortion with a special tool, and then grinding again etc.  For a lens like this with the massive front element and then probably 4 more elements behind it, the man-hours required to create it make it prohibitively expensive to make today.  As to why this process cannot be replicated with modern production equipment... I couldn't say."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2rvorp,msnyder622,2,Thu Jan 15 00:09:18 2015 UTC,"Because to make a wide angle lens the glass has to be fairly thin, which means the machines that grind them and move them are very expensive.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2rvorp,Mattfornow,1 point,Thu Jan 15 00:51:45 2015 UTC,"Makes sense to me.  I suspect that for limited/to-order production a non-specialised machine could do it, but the time it would take would be astronomical, I'm sure.  I can only imagine the number of digits in the price!"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2rvorp,ReasonablyBadass,10,Sat Jan 10 08:13:31 2015 UTC,"There's a lot to it. The large first piece of glass has a high surface area, so it can collect a lot of light, or is more sensitive. Cramming all the elements (lens pieces) close together means they have to bend the light sharply to get it to hit the next element in the right place. The more you bend the light, the more it tends to distort. That means that you have to try to prevent or un-do the distortion, or deal with it. Cheaper, smaller lenses deal with it. On more expensive the most cost effective way is to make it bigger. Photographers that would be needing to use a lens like this don't tend to need lightweight compact gear, so it's ok.     That and it makes our penis tingle..."

A good (though not exact) way to think of it: if a person can carry it around and fire it, it's a firearm; if not, it's a gun.  These rounds are for 30mm autocannons, which are mounted on APCs, helicopters, and planes. ""Autocannons"" tend to go from 20mm up to 45mm. These are ""small"" guns. Most Russian/Soviet artillery pieces are 122mm, 152mm, or 203mm, and their tanks are 100mm or 115mm on the old models, and 125mm for anything made in the last 50 years.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2rumlb,giblim,1 point,Sat Jan 10 10:23:43 2015 UTC,"This is only possible with mortars, and as far as I've heard, they only did that in WW1, and it was to use French ammo, not American.  It is true that most ground vehicles made by Russia have larger caliber guns than their nearest American equivilant (e.g. 25mm vs 30mm autocannons, 120mm vs 125mm tank guns), but this is not in any way so they can use the same ammo. Even other 120mm tank guns can't generally use American 120mm ammo, because cannons of any kind are much more complex than mortars."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2rumlb,SamsaraSailor,1 point,Tue Jan 13 11:41:59 2015 UTC,It says no less than one second and a half so it will be lit up for no less than that time wich is pretty good because if a bullet can travel 1200 feet per second that's 1800 feet that bullet will be lit up

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2rvvox,surprisepinkmist,1 point,Sat Jan 10 08:37:48 2015 UTC,"But it is still possible to have a 55mm fisheye, you just need a larger sensor or film negative. When shooting on 35mm film, a 50mm lens is considered ""normal"" as in it's not wide and it's not telephoto. But using a 50mm lens while shooting 16mm will result in a more telephoto image. So if you went the other direction, shooting 70mm film with a 50mm lens, you would be getting closer to a fisheye effect. Truly though, if 15mm is considered fisheye for 35mm film, you'd have to shoot on a negative with a size of 128mm to make a 55mm lens look like fisheye. I have no clue if anybody has ever shot something like that. It's nearly twice as big as Imax. Just saying that if other parameters lined up, you could have a 55mm fisheye."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,zebediah49,4,Tue Jan 6 18:18:09 2015 UTC,It does. Pat LaFontaine wore a more 'concussion-proof' helmet towards the end of his career in the 90's. These are for beer league players for superficial things like errant sticks and pucks. If you go to a youth hockey game you will see far more protective helmets.  Hockey has been a leader on this issue more than any other sport.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,coachjimmy,1 point,Tue Jan 6 18:31:35 2015 UTC,400 gram stick   Is that all a hockey stick weighs? I thought it would be much more.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,WhyAmINotStudying,6,Tue Jan 6 18:59:15 2015 UTC,Thats now.  Used to be twice that and made of wood. Now its all once piece carbon fibER sticks that are super light and can be engineered to have a particular flex (even different kick points).  They also seem to cost min $150 for a decent one these days. I'd like to see a Thingscutinhalf for one of those.  Anyone have a link?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,MAHHockey,3,Tue Jan 6 19:09:38 2015 UTC,Pretty much. When I was a kid my parents always bought the top of the line when it came to protective equipment and I still believe that I have minor damage to my brain after all the concussions I've had. Now that I buy my own stuff I'm not as concerned. Especially since it isn't as competitive for me anymore. I would never buy something like that for my child though.   Hockey helmets have come a long way but nothing will protect your head when you slam back first into the boards at full speed and your head snaps back. I still remember seeing stars and being woozy after that. Heck I've seen guys get hit so hard their eyes roll back in their head and they're lying on the ice convulsing. It'll take a scientific miracle to prevent stuff like that.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,AtrocityMarch,5,Wed Jan 7 04:40:09 2015 UTC,There's also the issue that it doesn't matter how good your helmet is if your neck gets folded in half.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,k_fry,10,Wed Jan 7 04:36:42 2015 UTC,"The hockey helmet looks like a Bauer 4500.  Although they do have better ones like the one linked, a large number of players still wear that lid."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,N0_PR0BLEM,7,Tue Jan 6 19:30:37 2015 UTC,"What baffled my mind when I played was that people would go OUT OF THEIR WAY to find and wear that helmet, as apposed to a Cascade which looks very similar to the football helmet pictured. I'll give you that these were guys that didn't have all that much to lose in the first place, but it was still always a conundrum for me."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,HattoriHanzo,5,Tue Jan 6 15:36:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I've never played hockey myself, but that one looks to be much lighter, they may prefer that, although that is no excuse for safety if it lacks that."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,thefrenchtickler69,5,Tue Jan 6 13:38:24 2015 UTC,"You need to track the puck at all times playing hockey, This constantly means you are twisting and spinning you head around.  Way more than in football, and yes its generally about weight and fov."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,yetkwai,6,Tue Jan 6 13:50:35 2015 UTC,"I used to play juniors and the Bauer 4500 is the go to helmet for teams because of its price and effectiveness. Its also a fashion thing, many players don't want to look soft in a cascade helmet. The helmets are also lighter because you always have your head on the swivel and you body check other players, not lead into hits head first."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,PM_ME_FETUSES,1 point,Tue Jan 6 14:59:47 2015 UTC,The other side is if you can't move you're head around to keep aware of what's going on you're more likely to not see an oncoming body check. Being blindsided is much more dangerous than taking a check when you can brace yourself.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,starlinguk,5,Tue Jan 6 18:00:42 2015 UTC,"To protect against contact with shoulders, arms, and the accidental head. Also, slamming into the ground after a hard tackle causes your head to whip lash into the ground, which may cause concussions. A helmet is enough layer of protection against that."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,Muffer-Nl,33,Tue Jan 6 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"Well, hockey helmets are designed to protect your head from getting hit with things; football helmets are designed to protect your head from hitting things.

Having your head down means you're looking down and can't see the play around you which results in you getting blindsided.   A helmet will protect your head, but doesn't do much for your spine if you slam head first into the boards. It is very, very bad to have your head down in hockey, so the helmet shouldn't be hitting much directly, just glancing blows here and there."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,CanadaEh97,9,Tue Jan 6 23:34:20 2015 UTC,yeah the hockey helmet looks a bit old we need the updated version of this

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,CanadaEh97,4,Wed Jan 7 05:59:16 2015 UTC,I use one of these when I play 'no contact' roller hockey.  Simply don't need the same level of protection as when I play ice.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,coachjimmy,2,Wed Jan 7 00:53:43 2015 UTC,I have a 4500 for ice hockey. Don't play contact anymore so no big deal but know guys who use this for contact hockey.  A lot of kids today are using the hockey helmets with a lot more protection for concussions and such.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ri6qa,CanadaEh97,2,Tue Jan 6 14:19:12 2015 UTC,"For adults, not kids. Adults generally play in control and far less competitively in no check leagues."

That design was mostly based off of a miniature display model Stormtrooper helmet design you could buy from a company called Riddell, which used to have a license to make official Star Wars merchandise. So this is an 'official' labeling of most of the parts, from 1996  This info is from an RPF forums thread that was visited by the guy who actually worked on the cutaway helmet:   Nelson Hall made the interior of that mask. As I recall, he vacuuformed styrene over an helmet pattern that was made by pouring plaster into an existing mask. I laser cut some of the detail, but Nelson did the vast majority of work on it, based in part on David West Reynold's design and mainly on the Riddell display piece.   The helmet facing us was composited in later; don't know its origins. It looks like it's the box art from the video release VHS tapes from the 90s....?

Asides from the common sense of making the cuts with blade spinning towards you, so the object you're cutting doesn't try to lift off, probably the only thing to keep in mind is to keep it steady - if you twist a half cut glass bottle the blade may catch and the bottle may split and cut you.  As for cutting across - that's what I usually do and then sand those smooth to make glasses or other things. Way easier than cutting longitudinally.  One other precaution I'd recommend is wearing a respirator even despite the fact that you're working wet. I still consider that glass dust gets airborne with the water mist. Protective glasses aren't a bad idea either, but that's just common sense again, I guess."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2r79wu,b33fman,3,Sat Jan 3 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"How do you deal with the blade chipping the edge of the cut badly? I tried this method, and rapidly decided it wasn't going to work as well as I wished.  Could you maybe do a step by step on your full method for a set of tumblers?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2r79wu,Phoenixed,3,Sat Jan 3 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"The most significant reduction of chipping probably comes from using a special blade for glass which is thinner. I mentioned some cutting nuances in my instructable for the clock shown above and a comment on it, however there's not that much stuff to go into detail in.  I currently have an issue with the blade vibrating and most of my chipping is due to that, so you may want to see if you have the same issue. That said, while it is possible to fix, as of now I do not deal with this problem itself, just with the consequences, meaning that I simply grind the chips out."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2r79wu,Ninjaplz10154,2,Sat Jan 3 19:41:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that helps a lot! I just resorted to making a jug for a cheap glass cutting tool, then heating and cooling to make it fracture (although we were only getting 1 in 3 usable by the end of that process)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2r79wu,Paiste402,2,Sat Jan 3 21:35:42 2015 UTC,"Despite not doing that currently because of failure rate and overall slowness, using a jig with a glass cutter will most likely end up in less work sanding it later and is worth it, if sanding is done by hand.  Try heating a little towards the side which you don't need - this way there's less chance of splitting somewhere you don't want it to. I've also found that using a small butane jet torch is a pretty good way to get it split nicely without additional cooling, unless it's a thick champagne bottle."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2r79wu,learn2die101,3,Sat Jan 3 21:46:13 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, this is how I would have done it.  I just couldn't pull the trigger and do it.  Eye protection too of course.  I've drilled holes in wine bottles and glass block and stuffed in lights to make things like this.  I guess the higher speed of the tile saw made me a little leery.   I like your projects.  Do you sand with emery paper?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2r79wu,sirblastalot,2,Sat Jan 3 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"Safety glasses have more use for protecting from the water splashing in the eyes since I've removed all the extra stuff around the blade to protect from that. Haven't had any glass stuff flying towards my face.  I sand it all on an improvised flat lap and finish off with a Dremel, would take a ridiculous amount of time to do it manually for the amount of chipping I still get due to blade vibration. You should also expect lots of chipping if using the standard blade which came with the cutter.  Bottles with garlands inside are great stuff, they are always well received as gifts and have some potential to work as a nice extra income before Christmas if you choose to go that way."

If you don't keep it close to your wings, well in check with your aerodynamic centre, things like this happen.This was caused by some cargo (military vehicles) shifting aft due to a too harsh liftoff and causing the center of gravity (COG) to move back and thus making the plane stall.   Ships similarly have to have their center of buoyancy above their center of gravity and have to be extremely careful with how they change with loading/unloading or during severe weather. Many, many ships have sunk due to cargo moving because its mooring failed or were not sufficient."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2pzuge,UtterlyDisposable,2,Sun Dec 21 22:07:41 2014 UTC,"I'm torn between agreeing and disagreeing with you. The rules say that the image must be a cross-section or a cutaway, but they don't indicate the symmetry of the cutaway. When we think of a cutaway, we usually expect the cut to be Cartesian, but there's no reason why it couldn't be polar.  If you're thinking in terms of polar coordinates, you could make a reasonable argument that something like a candy bar with the wrapper removed is a cutaway.  I'm mostly joking, of course, but there is some measure of validity to it :-p"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2pl0by,kelvindevogel,6,Wed Dec 17 19:31:57 2014 UTC,Some programs use a special trick that renders only viewing planes. For example in that image only the viewable stuff sides are rendered. While there may be a whole other side it is hidden therefore not rendered. What you may be seeing is a 3D plane of dots that viewed from another angle would not resemble a 3D shape as they are only surfaces visible at that angle. In short it may be what is happening here.   One example is in Minecraft there is a setting I can't recall the name of. But in short if you are standing in front of a wall blocking your vision the blocks behind are not rendered as you can't see them until you go around the other side. I think it's called Advanced OpenGL but that may be another setting haven't played in months.   In conclusion this process saves computing power and energy although requires a good decent bit in the first place to calculate what to render as it is why it is not always employed in lower end systems.   Sorry for weird grammar and spelling written on mobile.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2phewg,zoso135,26,Tue Dec 16 17:04:12 2014 UTC,"Fun fact: many modern tank barrels are no longer rifled, because they shoot different types of ordnance that would be damaged by the rifling."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2phewg,3rdweal,26,Tue Dec 16 17:08:15 2014 UTC,"It's not really ""damage"" - the lack of rifling means there is less friction, so you can fire these insane darts even faster, which helps them penetrate ridiculous thicknesses of armor.  They are too long and thin to be stabilized by rifling anyway, proportions they need in order to have a high sectional density, which makes them not only better at penetrating armor but also better at retaining velocity at long range.  Aside from that, HEAT rounds that rely on a very high velocity stream of molten metal to punch through armor also do not like to be rotated, as the centrifugal force imparted by a spinning shell causes the stream of metal to disperse and lose effectiveness."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2phewg,modernbenoni,9,Tue Dec 16 20:44:13 2014 UTC,Dope
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2phewg,pinkycatcher,2,Tue Dec 16 21:28:42 2014 UTC,A lot of these are also too long to be properly stabilized by any reasonable rifling. So they are stabilized by means other than the rifling (the fins)

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2phewg,uberfission,2,Tue Dec 16 17:19:41 2014 UTC,"I'm assuming they still want some of the ordinance to spin for stability, how do they induce it that?   Or do they rationalize that they're a fucking tank, probably shooting at other tank sized objects and really, who the fuck cares about that much accuracy when you're shooting at a tank?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2phewg,3rdweal,5,Tue Dec 16 19:45:08 2014 UTC,"No, accuracy is still extremely important. The primary reasons for smoothbore barrels, as they are called, are for fin stabilized ammunition and their greatly reduced barrel wear compared with rifled designs.   You still need to be accurate with what your firing even if it's larger. Larger rounds are very expensive, as are tanks themselves, so having ""brute force"" implementation would be a very poor strategy."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2phewg,vegiimite,3,Tue Dec 16 20:04:29 2014 UTC,"Actual accuracy is classified, but from the mouth of an Abrams crew member:   We boresight and calibrate our sights to make sure that we can hit a small target out up to 5 K away. We do this often because we want to be precise and be able to hit certain parts of vehicles when we fire these 60 lb rounds.   The laser-like trajectory of the extremely fast, dense and streamlined APFSDS darts coupled with modern targeting systems means that these things are unbelievably accurate, without the benefit of rifled barrels."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2pcbqz,3rdweal,63,Mon Dec 15 08:00:40 2014 UTC,"Wiki articles for the shell and the gun  From top to bottom we can see first the Ballistic Cap, the hollow area of the nose that gives the shell its pointed shape which made it more streamlined while flying through the air, losing less velocity per distance traveled downrange.  This increases impact velocity and therefore penetration, as well as giving a flatter trajectory making it easier to aim.  Next is the penetrating cap, made of softer metal attached to the main hardened shell.  This cap transferred energy from the tip of the shell to the sides of the projectile, thereby helping to reduce shattering. In addition, the cap appeared to improve penetration of sloped armor by deforming, spreading and “sticking” to the armor on impact and thereby reducing the tendency of the shell to deflect at an angle.  The effect is animated here.  The main part of the shell is the hard steel core responsible for penetration and nestled in its center is the bursting charge.  This was relatively tiny, by necessity because too big a charge would have weakened the shell and reduced its density, making it less likely to penetrate.  At the very bottom of the shell is the fuze which detonated the bursting charge, as well as the tracer element which allowed the tank gunner to track the progress of the shell as it speeds towards its target.  At a distance of 2,000 meters, this shell could punch through no less than 132mm of steel armor angled at 30 degrees from vertical.  This Sherman tank used for target practice clearly shows how easily its frontal armor could be penetrated."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2pcbqz,roccoccoSafredi,4,Mon Dec 15 08:00:52 2014 UTC,The bursting charge: was it designed to penetrate then explode?  Truly nasty business.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2pcbqz,roccoccoSafredi,7,Mon Dec 15 13:19:40 2014 UTC,"Yes, though in practice the bursting charge was so small that compared to the shower of hot metal that would result from the penetration it would hardly be noticable.  Igniting it at the right time was also tricky business, if it went off too early then its penetrating power would be compromised, if for example it was fired at the turret of a Sherman it might well go through both sides and explode after exiting."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2pcbqz,uberyeti,1 point,Mon Dec 15 15:53:29 2014 UTC,I'd imagine it might also have a minor anti-personnel role too.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2pcbqz,liotier,8,Mon Dec 15 16:38:21 2014 UTC,"For anti-personnel work you'd want the higher capacity HE shell - and even this from a high velocity gun needed relatively thick walls to survive the acceleration, so with less explosive than a howitzer shell of the same caliber."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2pcbqz,PowderTrail,1 point,Mon Dec 15 16:41:07 2014 UTC,"I am guessing the bursting charge may have had a small incendiary effect, helping to ignite fuel and ammunition which a solid shot may not otherwise have done. Is there any truth to this?"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p9hp8,YellowCBR,13,Sun Dec 14 20:16:46 2014 UTC,"Btw without the mirror it wouldn't be called a DSLR, since the term stands for digital single lens reflex and the mirror is an integral part of the entire system.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,jokersteve,7,Sun Dec 14 00:21:39 2014 UTC,Can someone explain the moving barrel? Seems unnecessary.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,JamesTBagg,23,Sat Dec 13 20:33:59 2014 UTC,"I'll try to explain from my phone. The M2 is recoil operated. The cartridge imparts momentum into the cycling components. First the barrel, then the barrel transfers it into the breech bolt. The barrel and breech bolt are locked together in the first moments of the cycle of operation. This ensures enough momentum is transferred into the breech bolt so that it will fly all the way to the rear of the receiver, over coming the operating springs.    I've spent quite a bit of time with the XM-218 (which is very similar to the M2) and the GAU-21 (M3M, which is the newest evolution of J.M. Brownings design.)"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,Sax45,19,Sat Dec 13 20:47:10 2014 UTC,"Good explanation of how it works, but you forgot the most important element of why. The gun could be designed so that the recoil of the cartridge blasts just the bolt back; this is called a ""blowback"" system, and it is how, for example, a PPK or Ruger 10/22 works.   Those guns, however fire very puny cartridges. The .50 BMG creates a much bigger explosion. The pressure in the chamber is much higher, and if the breach were immediately opened it would be dangerous to the user. Because the bolt and barrel travel together, the breach remains closed long enough for pressure to drop to a safe level.   Virtually every self-loading gun that uses a system other than blowback does so for this same reason. This system is one of the oldest ones around, with this gun in particular dating back nearly 100 years."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,TOO_DAMN_FAT,3,Sun Dec 14 00:18:31 2014 UTC,"I would like to add this discussion that covers this general topic of why it is important for a gun/cartridge to operate in this fashion: http://www.defensivecarry.com/forum/defensive-ammunition-ballistics/118179-legend-glock-40-caliber-kboom.html  You can also Google ""supported vs unsupported chambers"" under images to also see what we are getting at."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,Sax45,3,Sun Dec 14 03:03:45 2014 UTC,"Yes, this is an unrelated issue but it shows the potential danger of not properly accounting for the pressure of a cartridge."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,BattleHall,2,Sun Dec 14 03:13:34 2014 UTC,"The cartridge imparts momentum into the cycling components. First the barrel, then the barrel transfers it into the breech bolt.   Eh, kinda but not really. In a short recoil action, the force is actually applied to the breech/bolt, which then essentially drags the barrel back with it since they are locked together. This has the advantage of keeping the breech locked and the cartridge fully supported during the highest pressure part of the firing cycle. IIRC in the M2, as the bolt is unlocked, the barrel extension strikes the accelerator, transferring a portion of its kinetic energy into the bolt to assist with extraction and ejection."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,JamesTBagg,3,Sun Dec 14 04:02:35 2014 UTC,"I was trying to explain simply, from my phone. Not break down the cycle of operations in detail. But you are correct about the accelerator accelerating the breech bolt."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,BattleHall,1 point,Sun Dec 14 05:37:53 2014 UTC,"No prob, it was more about the bolt/barrel thing. It's a common enough confusion though, to the point where many shooters don't get which surfaces are the engagement surfaces of the locking lugs on a 1911; i.e. bullet is trying force the barrel forward due to the engraving force/friction while the slide tries to drag it backwards."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,whowhatwherenow,7,Sun Dec 14 06:01:41 2014 UTC,It doesn't use a gas operating system like say most assault rifles or light machine guns. Instead it uses short recoil blowback to cycle the ejection and loading. The barrel itself provides the recoil.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,3Nerd,3,Sat Dec 13 20:48:45 2014 UTC,"/u/JamesTBagg explained it well, but if you want more info, look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recoil_operation#Short_recoil_operation  It uses what is called short recoil operation to cycle the action, that is why the barrel moves back and forth."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,Eddyill,12,Sat Dec 13 23:36:47 2014 UTC,"I can't say for sure but I'm sure there is a spring or something forcing the cartridge down, I think gravity would be too unreliable especially on planes and vehicles."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,Taranok,1 point,Sat Dec 13 22:38:15 2014 UTC,"Eh, gravity, or rather G-forces, do impede the action of guns such as these.  Some guns are more sensitive than others but if the gun is put under enough forces, it definitely can fail, though it's a different type of failure than the gun simply being upside down causing a misfire or jam or what have you."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,mbillion,1 point,Sun Dec 14 03:32:45 2014 UTC,there is a top plate that forces the bullet into place and the arms come out and grab the bullet.  The bullet is not free until it is ejected.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p6z9b,tremens,2,Sun Dec 14 11:06:20 2014 UTC,"M3 is a submachine gun ;)  But I'm guessing you're referring to the AN/M3 and it's subvariants, the M3M, M3P, etc. These can all differ a little bit, but they will feature either electric or mechanical feed assist as the primary difference. Some designs like the M3M fire from the open bolt and feature double buffering. But three things will always be the same - AN/M3 variants are always assisted feed, they will always have a higher cyclic rate, and they will always be vehicle mounted (Helicopter door guns, primary machineguns for close air support aircraft like the Brazilian Super Tucano, a secondary gun for the Avenger SAM vehicle, etc.)  A classic M2 heavy barrel is around 600 rounds per minute, while an AN/M3 variant is 1,200 or better."

Aluminum weighs less and doesn't conduct as well as copper, obviously, so by unit of volume, the cost differences are even less than by weight."

Cu=$6.47/kg; 8960 kg/m3; = $57,971/m3 Al=$1.94/kg; 2712 kg/m3; = $5261/m3  That's actually 11X. But I need 1.679X the volume.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p3gqr,Triviaandwordplay,1 point,Fri Dec 12 21:21:56 2014 UTC,"That's not the same comparison I'm making. I'm just talking about the raw material to build a cable. You are quoting finished cable prices. But are still making my point that AL is a lot cheaper. You can jump up to 400 MCM on that site (would be pretty close to same resistance as 250 CU) and still be at $2/ft, or less than half the price."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p3gqr,Kaneshadow,0,Fri Dec 12 21:54:39 2014 UTC,"Just looked up some numbers and copper is over 10X the price per unit volume   Just taking you back since you seem to have forgotten the context. I thought it was an odd and misleading metric.   If there was that much difference in cost, it'd be a lot easier to make decisions when designing a transmission or distribution project. When copper went well past $3 per pound, we started to see more aluminum conductor being used on the solar projects where I live(tremendous amounts being installed).   Even at around $4 per pound, it still made more sense to use more copper conductor  than aluminum. Aluminum wire is more difficult to pull and make safe connections."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2p3gqr,thatloose,5,Fri Dec 12 19:25:21 2014 UTC,"Interesting thought. Looks like AL was cheaper than copper even in 1951. Not by today's margin, but still about 4.6X more per unit volume."

We have roughly 40% of our power generated in the South Island but 75% of our population is in the North Island (probably an even higher proportion of total energy use too).  The other factor to consider is that 98% of the power generated in the South Island is hydroelectric, so when we run out of water for generation during drought, power needs to flow back from North to South as we have more varied generation in the North Island (coal, geothermal, wind etc.)"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ouwwf,pinkycatcher,7,Wed Dec 10 13:40:57 2014 UTC,It holds the full auto sear. If it were in semi-auto mode then the hammer would catch on the disconnector (which is hard to see) and then flip over to the semi-auto sear which is a cut on the trigger piece.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ouwwf,thearn4,2,Wed Dec 10 15:37:38 2014 UTC,And the receiver in many civilian-market AR-15s is purposefully thickened in that area so they can't be as easily modified to accept a full-auto fire control group.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ouwwf,chich311,3,Wed Dec 10 13:48:21 2014 UTC,Fun fact: That's when they where developing the select fire for it. If you look closely you will notice the trigger is pulled when he releases the charging handle. The sear that catches the back of the hammer then trips when the bolt goes over it again is how it works. Very simple.

The only thing it's really missing is how the selector interacts with the tail end of the FCG (fire control group, the trigger bits and whatnot). For example, this is an AR15 selector (very simple), this is an M16 selector (bit more involved), and this is the M16A2 selector (bizarre, because burst cams make the baby Jesus cry)."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,plaidzebra,3,Sun Dec 7 19:29:44 2014 UTC,What gave away the manufacturer of the left one?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,rhs856,6,Mon Dec 8 01:34:42 2014 UTC,"Google-Fu :)  I've seen the picture floating around a bit, and traced it to an art exhibit by Guido Mocafico. There are some other pretty cool movements there as well."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,plaidzebra,35,Mon Dec 8 01:39:28 2014 UTC,"This isn't a cut in half due to the fact that these are indeed two different movements.   This is a true cut-in-half of a movement and watch.   One of my favourite brands, Panerai! :)  Shameless plug to /r/panerai :D"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,DanielPerianu,4,Sun Dec 7 20:42:14 2014 UTC,"Panerai makes some cool watches, but after the PAM318 Brooklyn Bridge scandal I just can't take them seriously anymore. Really ruined their reputation for me."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,piezeppelin,10,Sun Dec 7 21:26:21 2014 UTC,What happened?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,random_human_on_redd,23,Mon Dec 8 00:59:53 2014 UTC,"Very long explanation because I don't think everyone here is familiar with luxury watchmaking and its terminology:  Basically when you pay for a watch that costs a few thousand dollars, you expect the pieces to be beautifully finished.  The internals of the watch, the movement, have traditionally had decorative finishes applied that was a sign of the quality of the watch and the skill and hygiene of watch production.  A lot of these finishes are really fragile, so they can easily scratch, discolor, or show grime.  A beautiful, unmarked finish means the watch was constructed and handled with care.  In the original picture of this thread, you can see how different parts have different finishes.  On the left one you can see parts with straight graining, circular graining on the wheels, and perlage, the tiny little circle patterns.  One of the more obvious features on the Patek Phillipe on the right is the polished bevels of a lot of the parts.  Polishing parts requires a lot of time and contributes significantly to the cost of a watch.  Two watches that were functionally identical but had very different finishes would be worth significantly different amounts of money.  There can be different grades of the same movement, where one of the chief differences is just that one has a lot better finishing.  So Panerai decided to release this Brooklyn Bridge special edition watch.  Among the advertised features is a caseback engraved with the bridge, hence the name, and a nicely finished movement.  It should be noted here that many watches today have a clear case back, but this one had the solid metal one.  With a clear case back you can see and appreciate the moving mechanics and the effort that went into finishing.  So someone opened up one of their watches and they saw not the polished movement you would expect in an expensive movement, but a crudely finished scratched up movement that you wouldn't even be satisfied with in a $100 watch, nevertheless the $5-6k this watch costed.    Panerai didn't handle replacing the movements well.  While Panerai had lied about the movement, people had to cover shipping costs and had to go without their watches for months.  Panerai tried to spin it like they were being a good company for giving these free replacement movements, but they were just making people wait and pay extra for what they were originally promised.    Through this false advertising, Panerai could significantly save on the labor costs involved in making this watch."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,texas-pete,5,Mon Dec 8 04:49:31 2014 UTC,That is kinda crazy. I mean the people who buy Panerai are usually watch lovers or have interest in watches beyond the typical person. For them to think nobody would open up the back cover was a bit naive... I mean even website and YouTube reviews these days take a closer look at the movement.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,DanielPerianu,13,Mon Dec 8 09:22:00 2014 UTC,"Here is what should have been in there, and here is what they got.  Pictures taken from a WatchFreeks thread on this."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,upsidedownfunnel,5,Mon Dec 8 09:37:18 2014 UTC,"I totally agree.. although i am a Paneristi at heart. People have to realize that Panerai have moved on from the 318. Have you seen some of their newest models? Or even some of their supercomplications?   Here's a piece for you to look at from 2010. im sure you already know about it but still. The Panerai L' Astronomo Luminor Tourbillon 1950   Panerai, since the 318 have stepped away from the basic, asia movements to 'legitimate' in-house movements. Pretty much every Pam over about $12,000 will have a highly modified or completely in-house movement."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,DanielPerianu,1 point,Mon Dec 8 00:44:17 2014 UTC,"Yeah but the majority of Panerai watches sold contain an ETA movement and sell for about $6000.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,residude,1 point,Fri Jan 2 18:24:53 2015 UTC,"Very true.  Panerai sometimes uses custom Unitas movements which are primarily asian movements. Meaning, they are of the same quality of Swiss, but of an asian price point."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,beerpop,3,Mon Dec 8 09:26:56 2014 UTC,"Indeed. The reason they say 21 Jewels and all that is because they literally have that amount of jewels in them.  They're used on area like spinners and stuff basically because those areas, had they been metal on metal, would wear down really fast. Using a jewel instead greatly extends the life of the mechanical watch."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,DanielPerianu,1 point,Sun Dec 7 20:31:14 2014 UTC,As for the jewels. You see those red dots in places in the movement? Those are rubies or other stones. They use jewels instead of metal bearings because they do not wear down as fast (or as much) as metal.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2okfa1,KnowLimits,1 point,Sun Dec 7 20:38:59 2014 UTC,"They also have less friction than other materials.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2oge8f,slant1988,5,Sun Dec 7 07:21:09 2014 UTC,"Out of battery essentially means the round went off when it wasnt fully enclosed in the chamber. When the bolt moves forward, strips a shell out of the magazine and then closes behind the shell when it's in the chamber, the round is in battery. For most guns, that would be a big fuckin deal. In this video it seems like the shooter might not even have noticed."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2oge8f,Jigsus,3,Sun Dec 7 15:27:04 2014 UTC,"Due to the pressures involved, and the open ejection port so large and orientated away from the shooter, an out of battery ignition isnt quite so catastrophic. Now for instance if it were an auto firing a .50 BMG round, the pressures would be much closer to a hand grenade and be extremely damaging. It all has to do with pressure, which is VERY influenced by the casing material in which a round is made. Plastic ruptures much easier than brass etc. No matter what, this guy was a lucky SOB to be able to experience this without even noticing..."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2oge8f,WubWubMiller,16,Sat Dec 6 16:39:21 2014 UTC,Because it's a new recoil system that didn't exist when 99% of guns were made. Guns like the AA-12 and Kriss Vector are only feasible because of the recoil systems developed by their manufacturers.

They are jealously guarded by the guy who owns them (Jerry Baber) to the point where it's nearly impossible to even get your hands on one.  I had a client who manufactures assault weapons make a trip to TN specifically to test and purchase some of them, but was denied because the manufacturer was afraid he was going to try to copy the design.  Also just from memory, I believe he was asking $13k a piece for them.

When you ""pump"" a shotgun, what you are doing is pulling back the bolt and pulling back a round from the tube, that way when the bolt comes forward it can ""pick up"" the round and load it into the chamber to fire.  However, what makes the AA-12 system unique is that it depends entirely on the force released from firing a round to pull the bolt back. Obviously I didn't develop the AA-12, but if I had to guess, I would say that the idea for the bolt came while he was designing a way to reduce the recoil. I say that because springs are used in other guns to reduce recoil, but not the same way as the AA-12 uses them."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2oge8f,slackrvlution,-10,Sat Dec 6 16:27:42 2014 UTC,"To be fair, a fully automatic shotgun is of limited use at the best of times. What it's really mostly good for is making a lot of noise and using up ammo.   Humans simply do not have the strength to keep it on target, so from the 2nd shot on you're probably shooting anywhere but the target you intend to hit."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2oge8f,happyspark,16,Sat Dec 6 17:09:00 2014 UTC,That's why the AA-12 has a buffer system to enable you to aim bursts appropriately.  It helps to reduce muzzle rise and felt recoil.    A fully automatic shotgun has plenty of utility in the right scenario.  It's a great suppressive weapon/area control weapon for holding small open areas and clearing/holding buildings.  It's not like the gun runs at 1000 RPM like a full size machine gun... it runs around a slow 300 RPM enabling you to control your beaten zone very effectively.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2oge8f,satanlicker,-10,Sat Dec 6 15:32:49 2014 UTC,"This seems like the the type of gun that was designed for a shooting range, then someone conjured up a real world application for it but there's 4-5 guns that do it more efficiently?  Please note that I know jack shit about weapons or their real world applications. This just seems like overkill to me, the casual onlooker in the real world. Totally sweet in a range though!"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2oge8f,Black-Rain,5,Sat Dec 6 15:46:32 2014 UTC,"It's not really overkill when you understand how it's supposed to be used and how good it really is at it's job.    A typical 12 gauge 00 (""double ought"") shell (one ""bullet"" in Hollywood terms) fires eight 1/3 inch balls of steel or lead at one time.  That's like shooting eight 1/3 inch diameter bullets at a single target at one time.  The nice thing about a shot gun is that you get ""spread"" as the round travels over distance, whereas a rifle (your typical ""assault"" styled rifle you see military guys carry or that you see in Hollywood movies) shoots a single bullet at a time and it can only hit one single point at a time.  It's like using a chopstick to tenderize meat versus using a tenderizer mallet. Bigger surface area, means more meat tenderized.    That ""spread"" means you can cover a much larger area (more than a square foot and it gets even larger the farther the buckshot travels) with a single round than you can with a rifle (the American M-4 combat rifle fires a single .223 inch diameter piece of metal per round fired).  And that's just one shotgun shell.  Now think about multiple shells fired in really quick succession.  You're talking about multiplying that already huge surface area covered by one shotgun shell exponentially now.    In military training you are taught that the average human torso is about 14-19 inches wide (not including appendages).  If you can throw 8 pieces of steel out there in a 24"" spread and you can do that 3 or 4 times in extremely quick succession, you exponentially increase your chances of hitting and majorly maiming or killing a target.    Bring that to a real life scenario.  You're attempting to hold a room with a single normal sized doorway, meaning only one person can enter at a time.  The door acts as a funnel/chokepoint meaning EVERYONE entering has to go through that door.  All you have to do is aim AT the doorway and you will be able to kill anything that comes through it with your 1 foot or greater spread on that shotgun.    Apply this to an open area control/suppression scenario.  You're hiding behind an obstacle and the enemy is trying to advance and overrun your position.  Instead of carrying a 40 pound machine gun that can only shoot one round at a time (albeit really quickly), you have a 16 pound AA12 with three 32 round magazines full of 00 buckshot.  Each of those 96 rounds you are carrying is actually 8 bullets/steel balls fired at once.  You're actually carrying 768 bullets.  With the AA-12 you can shoot in the general vicinity of an advancing enemy and still be very likely to hit them.  This gives you an extreme advantage if your enemy only has point to point rifles in a short range scenario (which happens a lot in urban combat where buildings are close together and rooms are consecutive).    If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  The AA-12 isn't any good over long distances, but it's great at what it's designed to do:  short range devastation."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2oge8f,zma924,0,Sat Dec 6 17:04:09 2014 UTC,"In googling the AA-12, I found an exciting new round they made for it; The Frag-12:  http://www.defensereview.com/stories/aa-12/FRAG-12%20Projectile_1.jpg  ""There are three members of the FRAG-12 munition family: the FRAG-12 High Explosive (HE), FRAG-12 High Explosive Fragmenting Antipersonnel (HEFA, or HE-FA), and FRAG-12 High Explosive Armor-Piercing (HEAP, or HE-AP).  All three FRAG-12 rounds utilize a standard 3-inch 12-gauge cartridge case and propellant, which fires a fin-stabilized 19mm warhead with a MIL-SPEC 1316-compliant fuze assembly. The projectile arms after firing once it reaches 3 meters from the muzzle, and detonates on impact with the target. The FRAG-12 HE projectile, for instance, is designed to punch a one-inch diameter hole through 1/4-inch cold rolled steel plate, have a maximum effective range of 200 meters (200m), and reliably cycle/function in both gas-operated and recoil-operated tactical/combat shotguns. 200m is an impressive effective range for a 12-gauge tactical shotgun employed/deployed in infantry combat/urban warfare environments. The FRAG-12 HE-AP round incorporates a shaped charge to allow it to penetrate 1/2-inch steel armor plate. The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) states that ""the main reason for experimentation [with the FRAG-12 ammo family] is to examine these rounds as potential improvements to the combat-effectiveness of shotguns in urban areas [for urban warfare operations], using shotguns for stopping vehicles [vehicle interdiction] at roadblocks and checkpoints, barricade attack, and remote probing of potential Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)."""""

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2oge8f,ukstonerguy,3,Sat Dec 6 17:35:12 2014 UTC,"Five of the weapons were deployed with the 101st Airborne Division in Afghanistan in October 2010,[14] along with 1,000 hand-made air-burst rounds. The soldiers reported that the weapon was extremely effective at killing or neutralizing enemy combatants firing on US troops from covered positions. The US troops have nicknamed the weapon, ""The Punisher.""[15] First contact was 3 December 2010. As of February 2011, the weapon had been fired 55 times in nine engagements by two units in different locations. It had disrupted two insurgent attacks on observation posts, taken out two PKM machine gun positions, and destroyed four ambush sites. In one engagement, an enemy machine gunner was wounded by or so frightened of the XM25 that he dropped his weapon and ran away. The units with the XM25s had no casualties during the nine engagements. The weapon was called ""revolutionary"" and ""a game-changer."" One platoon leader commented that engagements that would normally take 15 to 20 minutes were over in just a few minutes. They performed flawlessly with no maintenance issues. Soldiers were so pleased that they carried it as their primary weapon without carrying an M4 carbine as a secondary. There were no complaints about its weight, but improvements to the battery life and a range increase to 1,000 meters were being sought. Each round was hand built at a cost of $1,000 each, but the cost is expected to be $35 per shot when in full production, scheduled from 2012.[16] The US Army ordered 36 more of the rifles in January 2012.[17] On September 12, 2012, Alliant Techsystems received a $16.8 million engineering and manufacturing development contract modification for the XM25. The contract funds the continuing design, integration, production, and testing of fully functional systems to ensure the weapon's final design meets performance requirements and is production-ready prior to fielding. ATK will be supporting another army XM25 forward operational assessment scheduled for 2013 with a 36 gun battalion set of new pre-production prototypes.[18]"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,Taranok,4,Fri Dec 5 05:16:46 2014 UTC,"More accurately, there's a tiny gap a fraction of a millimeter thick between the chamber and the actual barrel that is large enough to allow the chamber to freely rotate, but small enough to not allow most of the gas to escape out between the gap, causing the projectile to stop in the barrel itself and lead to a dangerous misfire.  It can't be seen here, but it's between the part of the barrel extending beyond the frame and the chamber, and it's something around a tenth of a millimeter thick.  It's not very big but it heavily focuses the expanding gas into a razor-like jet of gas that can cut flesh and even break bones, potentially, if not cut fingers off entirely (speculative).  This area is far, far more dangerous than any risk of burn caused from resting your finger on the chamber (where the explosions happen), which is safe enough to touch even after repeated firing to reload the weapon, but putting your fingers between the front of the chamber and the frame is guaranteed to cause some noteworthy (burn) to severe damage (cuts/broken bones) damage."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,DasUberSquid,2,Thu Dec 4 22:38:16 2014 UTC,"It's overcomplicated. Look at almost any other trigger group, they're far simpler."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,Taranok,7,Fri Dec 5 03:32:59 2014 UTC,"Ehh, the only thing really more complex about the Chiapa is that the hammer needs to transfer its momentum downwards to strike the shell, while normal revolvers just strike the shell directly in older models.  Newer ones have a safety feature requiring a trigger pull to place a strip of metal between the hammer and shell to allow contact, which does complicate the design.  But the redirecting of horizontal momentum to vertical momentum back to horizontal momentum is actually hard to do, likely leading to reliability problems in and of itself.  But regular revolvers are still pretty complex."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,OnTheBloc,-1,Fri Dec 5 04:46:22 2014 UTC,Incorrect. They require a slightly different grip because of the barrel axis. Your hand is naturally aligned with the handle. I know because I own one and it is awesome.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,TheSecretMe,3,Thu Dec 4 23:48:12 2014 UTC,Until someone tries a poor two handed grip or something like that.  You're basically saying they don't require a proper way of gripping as long as you grip them properly.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,OnTheBloc,-1,Fri Dec 5 06:58:31 2014 UTC,Incorrect again. It requires a two hand grip life all firearms for safety and it is natural when you handle it. You've never even fired one yet you're some expert...

These guns are known for their unpleasant trigger pulls due to all that unnecessary complication.  You are half right, this gun is needlessly complicated, most military or police weapons are designed to be as simple and rugged as possible whilst maintaining the needed safety features and functionality.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,C0lMustard,14,Thu Dec 4 17:00:06 2014 UTC,"This is quite rare in that it fires from the bottommost chamber in the cylinder, rather than the top. On top of that, it isn't cocked by pulling back on the hammer, but with a cocking-lever, which is connected to an internal hammer. A more conventionally laid-out revolver will have far fewer moving parts."

Revolvers generally don't even have a safety, though a safety could be as simple as a lever that slides up and blocks the hammer."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,TheAdvocate,2,Thu Dec 4 17:03:47 2014 UTC,in this case all the extra bits are because this gun shoots from a bottom mounted barrel to help centerline recoil.  Its a difference from all normal revolvers that makes things very complex.

The lower bore axis has a lesser angle of torque and allows a more efficient impulse absorption. This calculates to a theoretically smaller shift. But a gawdawful trigger pull has more detraction to accuracy than a high bore axis.   I'm surprised no one has mentioned that this design is made by E. Ghisoni, same designer of the Mateba Mod.6 Unica Automatic. Maybe the trigger linkage wasn't completed before he passed away."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,MystifiedMustard,3,Fri Dec 5 03:48:32 2014 UTC,"Yes, the entire state. In CA, the Department of Justice keeps a list of handguns ""approved"" for civilian sales. However the requirements to get into the approval list are extremely high and in some aspects technologically and economically unfeasible (such as micro-stamping technology, which is patented and must be licensed from the owner of the technology, who incidentally will not license it easily.)  Typically when a handgun ""falls off"" the roster, the handgun must be resubmitted to the DOJ. So if the company makes a handgun safer by adding a feature or changing to better materials, its now considered a new product and must be submitted to the roster. FYI, if you change the color of the handgun, it is considered a new product and must be submitted to the roster. Because of this the roster is shrinking and things like the Glock Gen4 and other new models are not legal for CA sales."

You also need a chamber and barrel capable of withstanding the force of the expanding gasses.     The most plastic 3d printed designs I'm aware of use only 1 metal part.     (Other than the ammo, obviously.) They require you to insert a nail to act as the firing pin.      These guns also only fire a small caliber and the plastic barrels are ruined and useless after only a few shots.     I imagine you could probably make the firing pin and barrel out of some sort of fancy ceramic.  But you can't 3d print that yet.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,voodoo_curse,-13,Fri Dec 5 00:06:30 2014 UTC,"So I had one of these. I was at the range shooting it for the second time, I decided that I would pull the ""hammer"" back and shoot it single action. My trigger finger was off the trigger right along the side of the frame where the cylinder gap is. My thumb slipped and the hammer dropped. The fucking gun fired. I was shooting a full 357 mag load and the hot gas escaping cut a nice black line into my right index finger. It hurt like hell and my finger was numb for the next 2 days.  These guns are a goddam safety hazard."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,FukNGrvN,14,Thu Dec 4 17:18:35 2014 UTC,"That doesn't even make sense. This gun's ""hammer"" is not actually a hammer.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,mscman,-5,Thu Dec 4 18:06:30 2014 UTC,No my finger was not on the trigger. I wish it would have been because it nearly blew the tip of my trigger finger off.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,Burkasaurus,10,Thu Dec 4 18:54:29 2014 UTC,"Yes... that is how revolvers work. If you let the hammer drop, it can fire the round. The trigger drops the hammer after it's cocked."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,dietbroccoli,-5,Thu Dec 4 18:11:33 2014 UTC,"No, that's not ""how revolvers work.""  Any modern gun worth a damn will have a firing pin block."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o9omz,FukNGrvN,6,Thu Dec 4 19:13:11 2014 UTC,"In fact, the hammer on this gun isn't actually a hammer and isn't even near the firing pin.  I cant imagine how what he's describing could have happened unless the trigger was depressed or somehow stuck."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,ARottenPear,35,Tue Dec 2 16:34:09 2014 UTC,I own a 94 rx7. These motors are very smooth and produce a lot of power but the apex seals are prone to breaking. Lots and lots of money.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,Typical_Stormtrooper,10,Tue Dec 2 17:25:47 2014 UTC,"Yes they did. I know my rx7 goes thru a lot of oil but it's not my daily driver anymore so it's not an issue. I don't think I've heard of an engine even make it to 100,000. Mine was rebuilt before I bought it and I had it rebuilt again shortly after I purchased it. I guess it depends on how you drive it, but I didn't buy it to go slow."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,gut_killer,9,Tue Dec 2 17:31:06 2014 UTC,"That's sad, rotary engines seem so much more efficient on paper, but I still have yet to see a company perfect a long lasting rotary engine."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,Typical_Stormtrooper,10,Tue Dec 2 17:39:08 2014 UTC,"The issue rests with the torsional loads on the apex seals.  It'd be much more reliable to ""allow"" the engine to just burn the oil like a 2-stroke, but the EPA came in and said that's bad to do, which is why we don't see too many 2-stroke engines outside of the odd dirt bike and yard tools."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,soloxplorer,3,Tue Dec 2 18:19:08 2014 UTC,"Core flaw is poor flame front due to a sub optimal shape of the combustion chamber and the void the explosion moves to fill as the rotor rotates. Too much gasoline goes un burned because of the shape. The seals are an issue, but the poor mpg is wholly down to this."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,hglman,2,Tue Dec 2 22:34:26 2014 UTC,Do they?  Because the RX-8 sucked gas ridiculously bad.  Like 12mpg bad.  For a 200hp motor.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,Kaneshadow,13,Tue Dec 2 21:57:49 2014 UTC,"They do,   Advantages: The Rotary Engine is very simple. It’s a motor design that utilizes way less moving parts than it’s piston counterpart. The 13B-MSP Renesis (from the RX8) has the highest horsepower per displacement of any naturally aspirated motor produced from the Factory in America. For it’s size, the rotary packs a punch. For reference, the 13B from the RX8 is a 1.3 liter, and produces 232 horsepower. That equates to a ridiculous 178 horsepower per liter. In Theory, that would be equivalent to a 6.0 liter LS2 (from the Corvette) producing 1068 horsepower N/A from the factory. Unlike Piston engines, Rotaries are almost immune to catastrophic failure. In a piston motor, you can have a piston seize and cause all kinds of damage, but in a Rotary motor, while the engine will lose power, it will continue to produce a limited amount of power until it finally dies. Rotaries will also rev to the moon and still make power. For instance, A RX8 redlines at 9k and that’s where it makes peak power as well. Needless to say, the Rotary likes to stay high in the RPM range.  Disadvantages: One of the most common misconceptions is that the Rotary engine burns oil out of fault, this is not necessarily true. The Rotary uses oil squirters that take small metered amounts of oil and mix it into the fuel to lubricate the seals. Gas mileage is very Mehhhhh at mid 20’s (supposedly….much less in reality.) Rotaries also tend to produce about as much torque as a screwdriver and seals tend to be a big problem after a while if you live in a colder climate. Parts are generally expensive and since it’s a Rotary, you have to take it to rotary mechanic or dealership to get it worked on when something goes awry. Rotaries sometimes have a problem flooding with fuel on cold starts as well. This generally only happens with older 13B’s, so it’s necessary to let the motor warm up to operating temperature before you decide to take off.  so there you have it"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,Typical_Stormtrooper,6,Tue Dec 2 22:47:21 2014 UTC,"But my question was, ""Does it [appear more efficient on paper]?""  But it doesn't really, there are numerous advantages but none of them are suited for a road car, except maybe low vibration levels.  Hey, why hasn't anyone made a motorcycle with a rotary engine??"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,Kaneshadow,3,Wed Dec 3 02:26:20 2014 UTC,I would like to introduce you to the Suzuki RE5
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,BlueFamily,2,Wed Dec 3 04:30:26 2014 UTC,"That's why I used the word ""seems"" using it as loosely as possible taking in factor that a rotary engine produces more power per liter than a conventional 4 stoke motor.  So it would seem more efficient but when it comes down to it there are others short comings that make this motor overall less efficient."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,Typical_Stormtrooper,4,Wed Dec 3 02:40:59 2014 UTC,"OK.  I think we're in agreement.  So let's start designing that motorcycle.  Seriously, it'll be sick."

My first one I bought at 140k. Had that for a while and put up to 170k on it. Mind you the engine was never rebuilt, I bought it from the original owner that took very good care, as did I. They will last but the only problem is people try to treat them like a piston engine and YOU CAN'T DO THAT. That's exactly why people say the engine sucks is because they don't realize the rotary engine burns oil so they run it to shit or put synthetic in. DON'T DO THAT. I hate the bad rep these wankel engines get because the owner is a tard that doesn't know how to maintenance them.  Hopefully your friend will be fine though. As long as the previous owner didnt screw the engine up. But typically buying a rotary close to 150k miles is a BIG no-no."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,Jaybleezie,1 point,Wed Dec 3 02:30:56 2014 UTC,"put synthetic in.    This is only bad because its expensive, right?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,CoolGuy54,3,Wed Dec 3 09:12:35 2014 UTC,"No, it's because of the oil injection system that causes the known oil consumption. Synthetic oils burn differently than non-synthetic dino oils, and that's where the damage stems. I prefer to remove the proprietary oil injection systems entirely on these cars to allow the use of synthetic oil, and simple run a pre-mix oil in the gas tank. Eliminates the problems associated with synthetic burn during combustion, and allows the benefits and longevity of synthetic oil on the lubricant side of the equation."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,hardxstyle,2,Wed Dec 3 09:59:07 2014 UTC,No no no. Rotary engines burn oil. When you put synthetic in the oil burns and the engine will get carbon build up causing you to lose power and it will run like shit.   Edit: leading to an early engine rebuild.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,Jaybleezie,1 point,Wed Dec 3 16:59:52 2014 UTC,"And the other dude said synthetics leave more shit behind when they're burnt than dino oils, which I hadn't heard but I'm willing to accept.  Seems like the way other rotaries do it of having a separate total loss oil circuit where you can run 2T oil would be superior."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o1pwe,CoolGuy54,6,Wed Dec 3 18:30:06 2014 UTC,"I know a guy who had an rx7. He says his lasted way longer (I want to say 150,000 miles but I'm not really sure) than any other rx7 he'd heard of because he would always let it warm up for 5 minutes before he started to drive it. It makes sense when you think about it, in a wankel engine the ignition is always in the same spot, so the engine heats up from that one spot. So when you start it and immediately start driving, that spot gets very warm before the rest of the engine, and it seriously reduces the lifespan. If you let it idle, the whole engine warms up and it doesn't have such a big heat expansion difference."

It almost looks like a coupling over two ends of pipe to me though, which makes me think those are two shear pins set perpendicular to one another.  Should a car hit the hydrant parallel to one of the pins, the other pin could still shear and allow the hydrant to ""give way"" top the car."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,WEprez,3,Tue Dec 2 11:17:13 2014 UTC,"No they're shear pins set in single shear, offset 90°. Notice how the coupler is only cut halfway through on each side meaning it wouldn't have a range of motion which is somewhat of a requirement to be a u joint.   Shear pin info  U joint"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,BcookieOmonsterB,3,Tue Dec 2 18:31:13 2014 UTC,Yes but it should be noted southern california doesn't use dry barrel fire hydrants because there's little risk of freezing. Wet barrel hydrants which are used in warmer climates would have more potential to gyser out if struck and broken off.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,BaggedTaco,4,Tue Dec 2 12:45:51 2014 UTC,"Sooo, what's with the weird fire hydrant shape? In theory couldn't it just be a pole?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,Geotolkien,1 point,Tue Dec 2 14:02:28 2014 UTC,"Well part of it is to handle the mains pressure, usually around 200psi. A bell curve is much better at taking that load then just a flat cap. And the bolted sections are there for maintenance so if it needs repair you don't have to replace the whole thing."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,ic33,1 point,Tue Dec 2 14:30:05 2014 UTC,Ummm. Not sure where you pulled that 200psi number from but the state regulations where I'm from stipulate that pressure may not be more than 150psi and that water systems should be built to run between 20 & 125psi. Pretty sure we use mostly the same standards as all the other 49 states.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,BaggedTaco,5,Tue Dec 2 16:26:49 2014 UTC,"The pressure you design critical parts of the system to withstand and the normal operating points of a system are often different.  Also, many water distribution systems run at a higher pressure than what's in houses and there is a pressure reducer in-between.  It is common for hydrants to be rated to operate at a maximum of  200-250PSI.  I agree 50-150psi are more normal numbers, and plenty of hydrants do run at just 20psi."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,Geotolkien,1 point,Tue Dec 2 17:13:54 2014 UTC,"It's totally normal for mains pressure to be significantly higher then what you find at your tap. If they only ran at 70 psi and everyone took a shower the pressure drop would be significant.  Either way, like /u/ic33 said below, most hydrants are rated at a 250psi working pressure.  Source"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,BaggedTaco,1 point,Tue Dec 2 17:44:19 2014 UTC,"Most hydrants are rated at a higher pressure than they would take on a daily basis, because as they age that ability to take pressure will degrade.   As for your assertion that a pressure of 70 psi would lead to a drop during high demand periods, extreme pressure drops are the result of inadequate pumps, elevated storage, pipe diameter, or a combination thereof. A properly designed system should be able to maintain pressure fairly consistently unless there is a break or fire.  Pressure at the mains may be reduced by pressure regulators going into homes but the range I gave is the regulations for pressure at the mains themselves. Perhaps it is lower than the 200psi due to our aging infrastructure."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,Geotolkien,2,Tue Dec 2 18:12:32 2014 UTC,"I'll have to take your word on it, I'm just an IT guy so my experience with this is minimal. I do know the pipes coming in to feed our sprinkler system register at 200psi. You may be correct on the age of the infrastructure limiting that, this is a fairly new industrial park here.  Almost everything I could scour from google about the state seems to only talk about CFM and not much about the psi. I'm sure it exists somewhere but it's not at my fingertips."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,rainwulf,1 point,Tue Dec 2 19:22:01 2014 UTC,"Thats interesting, systems built just for fire flow don't necessarily have the same regulations on them as potable. A higher pressure is desirable for fire suppression."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,willseeya,1 point,Wed Dec 3 04:38:41 2014 UTC,"Hydrants often run at 350kpa which is roughly 50psi. Aside from that only the valve at the bottom sees line pressure so it wouldn't really explain the shape of the upper section. And yes they could be a relatively straight pipe, in fact this is what Germany does. Firemen carry a key to open a cover, then install the standpipe and attach hoses.   > The user attaches a hose to the fire hydrant, then opens a valve on the hydrant to provide a powerful flow of water, on the order of 350 kPa (50 lbf/in²) (this pressure varies according to region and depends on various factors including the size and location of the attached water main).

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2o0tyy,AgentMullWork,2,Tue Dec 2 17:10:19 2014 UTC,There actually is a one-way drain valve that opens when the hydrant is closed allowing water in the barrel to drain back into the water main.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2nxxz0,jonjiv,22,Mon Dec 1 16:40:54 2014 UTC,"You can't tell from the Tesla pack's photos, but their pack is made up of about 7000 Panasonic 18650 cells, modified versions of these.

There are four of them in each module, 2 in series and 2 in parallel, meaning that the leaf has 48 modules in its pack, but 192 individual cells."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2nxxz0,code-,6,Mon Dec 1 17:22:50 2014 UTC,I've heard Tesla only used 18650 cells in the first prototype models. They're using something different now that they're in production. [1]  [1] Some guy on Reddit said so.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2nxxz0,jonjiv,3,Mon Dec 1 18:46:24 2014 UTC,They're still the 18650 size. The question is exactly which 18650 Panasonic cell Tesla is using. Panasonic has come out with better cells since the Model S debut in 2012.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2nxxz0,byzantineconduit,1 point,Mon Dec 1 18:59:57 2014 UTC,"You may be right  Then again, they appear to still be cylindrical, so calling them modified 18650 cells could still be accurate, even if the size has changed."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2nxxz0,code-,6,Mon Dec 1 18:57:24 2014 UTC,"Interestingly enough, the classification of 18650 directly refers to the size of the cell itself. an 18650 battery is 18.6mm in diameter, 65mm in length, and cylindrical in shape (hence the ""0"").

Cheers for the detailed reply"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2nxxz0,fooknprawn,1 point,Mon Dec 1 20:41:28 2014 UTC,It depends on the chemistry of the battery how it reacts to overcharging/short circuits/poking with a sharp knife.  For example Lithium Cobalt can produce a nasty flame and because of that also quite a lot of expanding gas which results in an explosion if the battery container is airtight. Or just a fire that burns your house down. But it takes some effort or really crappy batteries/chargers to do that.  I use mainly 18650 Lithium Manganese at the moment for big e-cigarette mods or flashlights. I've seen a bunch of videos of people trying their best (or worst) to ruin these batteries with overcharging/shortcuts/knifes and all that happens is that they get pretty hot for a while but nothing else happened.  Lots of informations on batteries:  http://batteryuniversity.com/  http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/types_of_lithium_ion
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2nxxz0,ShrimpCrackers,3,Mon Dec 1 22:16:07 2014 UTC,"Tesla's batteries don't explode but they're designed to channel thermal runaways through the side of their battery pack.  It's a slow burn and allows for safe exit of the car in the event that a module is damaged. Tesla batteries have experienced some fires due to catastrophic punctures of the pack by road debris last year but they since reinforced the front the packs with a titanium plate (the bottoms already have 1/4"" aluminum plating) and they haven't had any issues since then.  They did a blog post when they announced the retrofit to car with some great videos of stuff being obliterated by the reinforcement.

With further googling I found this product that has this line ""The proprietary and patent pending 4 gear design is non-reverse rotation so no additional drivetrain modifications are required""  So with that in mind it seems that the one posted by OP is designed with drive modifications in mind to reverse the rotation. I've seen a quite a few pictures where when you install these you also install new axles and differentials. You could easily change the direction of rotation in the differential. While there are others on the market that are more of a straight bolt-on application.  Last, I found some of these with planetary gears in them, which reverse the rotation of them as well."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2npkrp,chriszuma,5,Sat Nov 29 05:58:02 2014 UTC,"It actually helps the driveline be more robust though, since there's less torque going through the differentials, u-joints and half shafts."

This thing would whine at speed though- but straight cut gears are the strongest. The casing appears to be too substantial- very heavy cast iron no doubt- at odds with that lovely delicate little CV joint. I'm not a fan of independent suspension set up for genuine hardcore offroad vehicles- there are always strong limitations to axle articulation and this set up would be no different. A solid axle is always stronger and lasts longer. Vehicles like Unimogs and Land Rovers (series/defenders etc) and others always use a solid axle- the unimog is the best of them all bar none."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2ngcs7,Kratzyyy,25,Wed Nov 26 07:59:24 2014 UTC,"From elsewhere, the numbers behind this system are just mind boggling.  This is basically how the system works. The function is graphically explained in more detail in the video linked to below.  Using a variety of sensors, an airborne target is tracked and the range to the target is calculated.  A shell is fired at 1050 metres per second (3445 feet per second) and at the muzzle, in less than a milisecond, the velocity of the projectile is measured, time of flight to target is calculated and the electronic fuse on the shell is programmed to activate the shell in the path of the target.  24 shells are fired in one burst, all in the space of less than 2 seconds.  Once the shell is in the path of the target, a small ejection charge bursts the shell open.  It is not a high explosive shell, so the charge does not add energy to the equation.  What it does is eject 152 tungsten subprojectiles in a conical pattern.  Each subprojectile weighs 3.3 grams - assuming that by the time it reaches the target the shell has shed 1000 fps from its initial velocity, this means that the subprojectile is travelling at around 2500 feet per second.  This gives it a kinetic energy of 700 ft-lbs, the energy of a .357 magnum bullet, though since it is much denser and faster, it will penetrate much further - and this is just one subprojectile.  A 24 round burst means that the unfortunate target will fly into a cloud of 3,648 such projectiles.  The AIM-4 Falcon missile illustrated was used as a test target, the actual test can be seen on video here.  Note that the damage was the result of a static test, if the missile had been travelling at speed the result would have been even more devastating."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2n8tbb,bob_in_the_west,30,Mon Nov 24 14:37:41 2014 UTC,"From the wikipedia article:   In a standard heat pipe, the condensed liquid is returned to the evaporator using a wick structure exerting a capillary action on the liquid phase of the working fluid.   It doesn't matter which orientation the pipe has. The wick structure acts kind of like a sponge. The working fluid is evaporated out of the wick structure at the hottest point and the vapor fills the rest of the pipe. The vapor is then condensed at the heat sink, making the now condensed liquid move into the wick structure again, making room for more vapor to reach the heat sink. That means that you can even have a heat sink where the vapor travels downwards and the liquid upwards."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2n5s2l,hodyoaten,19,Sun Nov 23 14:49:52 2014 UTC,The particles (ions) are directed by magnetic fields. They do not directly interact with the structure. An exception would be after they collide two beams some of the ion scatter so they are no longer moving in a nice collimated beam.   You might be interested in a 'beam dump' which is process where the accelerated ions are shot at a huge block of metal (I don't remember if it is copper or tungsten) to get rid of them. It takes a couple of meters of solid metal to stop the beam.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mzjn9,ydnab2,15,Fri Nov 21 23:15:31 2014 UTC,*theoretical greater dynamic range   because loudness war
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mzjn9,n7275,4,Sat Nov 22 01:18:19 2014 UTC,"Ugh, the loudness war sucks. Ever since I learned about how it all goes down, it frustrates me more. There's so much more that can be done with digital compared to analogue, but they compress the audio and bring up unnecessary sounds into the music. I'm tired of lip smacks and breathing sounds. Fortunately, this seems to only be radio play, and CD audio quality has less of it."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mzjn9,ydnab2,2,Sat Nov 22 03:33:37 2014 UTC,Some vinyl records have the sound equivalent of a higher bit rate. Maybe that's why. But digital is the best source.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mzjn9,Shiroi_Kage,3,Sat Nov 22 00:30:29 2014 UTC,"Well, in a sense, analogue has a bitrate of infinity.   Digital attempts to emulate the sine wave that analogue inherently creates through rises and runs. A higher bit rate in digital means many more, and tinier, rises and runs in the sine wave, creating a smoother look. But if you were to ""zoom in"" enough, you'd still see the square shaped rise and run of the digital format. As far as my understanding goes, this doesn't happen with analogue.  And yes, I agree. Digital is the better source."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mzjn9,ydnab2,2,Sat Nov 22 03:31:24 2014 UTC,I'm honestly curious how many contemporary vinyls are created with a pure analog process. It seems like it would be a lot more trouble than it's worth when digital recording and mastering is the norm.   I suppose the master could be made at some ridiculous bitrate (too high to distribute digitally) so that the vinyl would be really close (smaller than perturbations cause by noise) to the idealized wave.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mwei0,Montezum,3,Thu Nov 20 21:51:21 2014 UTC,"Wait, does it use more than the spring for the shot? Are all guns like that?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mwei0,Montezum,1 point,Thu Nov 20 23:24:34 2014 UTC,I'm not sure what you are asking here?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mwei0,Akula_matatta,4,Thu Nov 20 23:30:38 2014 UTC,"Sorry, it might be a language problem. I'm asking if a piece like this is the only thing that does the ""force"" to shoot the bullet out or if there's anything else involved."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mwei0,Montezum,22,Thu Nov 20 23:41:00 2014 UTC,"I like the simplicity of your question. The spring drives the firing pin (the pinkish rod in the animation) forward and into the back of the chambered round, which is sitting in the firing chamber, lined up just behind the barrel.  On the back of the round is a ""primer,"" which is a small, shock-sensitive explosive which is set off when struck by the firing pin. This primer then ignites the gunpowder, which fills the space in the case between the primer at the back of the round and the bullet at the front. This gunpowder burns very quickly- so fast that you might as well call it an explosion, which causes gasses to quickly expand (conversion of chemical energy into heat energy). This expanding gas moves along the path of least resistance, which, when the round is chambered, is along the barrel and out the muzzle of the gun. This expanding gas pushes the bullet, which is seated in front of the gunpowder and fills enough of the barrel that the gas can not escape around it, out the barrel with it, reaching great speed.   So the short answer is no, the bullet is not launched just through the power of the spring, however the spring is the force which sets off a chain reaction that results in the bullet traveling out the barrel of the gun."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mwei0,Camtreez,2,Fri Nov 21 09:40:17 2014 UTC,"This gun uses a principal of ""direct blowback."" When you watch the animation, you can see that the firing of the bullet pushes back on the case, which pushes back on what is known as the ""bolt"" which cycles the weapon and chambers another round, ready to fire again.   Some pistols use a principal known as ""delayed blowback"" which ensures that the chamber remains sealed until the bullet leaves the gun,thus ensuring as much of the energy as possible is imparted to the bullet."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mwei0,Montezum,5,Thu Nov 20 23:57:02 2014 UTC,"Um, okay... The spring isn't what forces the bullet. When the trigger releases the spring, it propels the firing pin into the back end of the cartridge, striking the primer. The primer then ignites the powder within the cartridge. It's the force of the rapidly expanding gas released from the burning powder that propels the slug out of the cartridge and down the barrel.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mrljh,5diggs,25,Thu Nov 20 00:26:06 2014 UTC,Glass is a solid.  It's a myth that it's a liquid.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mrljh,detroitmatt,10,Thu Nov 20 00:30:59 2014 UTC,"It's a myth that it's a supercooled liquid but it isn't a myth that it exists in a wierd state. It's solid in the short range but in the long range it exists in a disordered state. At this point it's a question of how you actually define a state of matter. Using a traditional 3-4 states under the definition of order in the short range, glass is reffered to as an amorphous solid, which is sort of not really solid. Under alternate views of states of matter it gets a little more complicated on what glasses are. Glasses are structurally similar to liquid but exhibit various properties of a solid."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mrljh,5diggs,10,Thu Nov 20 02:31:26 2014 UTC,"A liquid can be explained as being a substance with little to no shape-changing resistance.  Apply an extremely weak force like gravity to it and it changes to fit the container, or it just spreads around because there's nothing to contain it.  Can't do this with most solids since it requires another set of forces to be applied in order to resemble a liquid-like state.  The case of a bullet, gravity alone won't deform it.  However, when you apply enough inertia forces to the bullet (by way of velocity and an impenetrable barrier), it'll deform and ""flow"" through the least resistant path, just like any other liquid."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mrljh,Fun1k,6,Thu Nov 20 01:38:11 2014 UTC,"Don't be so caught up in whether something is called a liquid or a solid. As soloxplorer just explained, whether or not something is considered a liquid or solid depends on context: This bullet is solid with regards to gravity, but simultaneously liquid with regards to gravity+inertia. ""Solid"" and ""liquid"" are fairly arbitrary points on a scale that we decided to give names to. Most people would say glass is a solid but some call it a very slow-moving liquid."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mrljh,ktappe,2,Thu Nov 20 02:41:33 2014 UTC,"While they have given you practical explanations, a solid is generally something that has distinct repeating crystal structure.   The metal is a solid, not a liquid, because there are Austenite and Ferrite crystal structures in the steel. Think about crystal structures as ordered structures made up, in the case of steel, of carbon and iron atoms in repeating cubes (very simplistic explanation).  So there is an actual difference, on the atomic level, between a solid and a liquid.  A liquid would simply have Fe and C atoms floating around. The atoms are still bonded together, but there is no real structure.   Think of water. There is a unit, or molecule, of two hydrogen atoms attached to an oxygen atom, and in liquid form these molecules are bonded to other water molecules by hydrogen bonds. In a solid, they are also bonded together by hydrogen bonds. BUT! We know ice and liquid water are different. Why?  Well those H2O molecules in ice form hexagonal crystals. In liquid form, this structure does not emerge. Ever wondered why snow flakes have 6 corners? Yup, it's because the atomic building block of ice is the hexagonal crystal structure. if that doesn't blow your mind, I don't know what will  By now you're probably tired, but if you are interested in learning more, I'd suggest picking up an intro to materials science book. This shit is fascinating.  (and to put in a disclaimer for any ciritcs, yes I know amorphous solids exist, but I didn't want to confuse the matter more. Look them up on wikipedia to find out more!)"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mrljh,5diggs,1 point,Wed Nov 19 18:03:31 2014 UTC,"For all intents and purposes though, it really is a liquid while it is flowing, isn't it? Just like any natural liquid, its resistance to shape-changing has been overcome. Just by a different means. It effectively ""freezes"" once those forces are withdrawn. Or does the definition of a liquid require that temperature be the only energy source by which shape-changing resistance can be overcome, and momentum-based energy is specifically disallowed as a means to the same end?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mrljh,DarxusC,4,Wed Nov 19 21:40:02 2014 UTC,"One of the general differences between solids and liquids is that the molecules in a solid don't slide past or move in relation to each other without a large outside force. If you don't deform it too much, it springs back. This is called elasticity. All solids elastically deform a certain amount per unit of force (psi, kPa), unless you go beyond the elastic region, and start undergoing plastic deformation. That is when the molecules start dislocating and taking on a new shape.   Molecules in a liquid are free to slosh around, and push and pull, but they are missing a key property of solids, resistance to shearing. It takes energy to shear or cut paper, metal, etc, but scissors do nothing to water. One of the other defining properties of liquids is they take the shape of their container. They don't have enough energy to be like gasses that fill the entire volume of their container."

That is a solid metal, made up of metal grains, which are each a crystal. When that piece is struck, the units within the crystal deform, stretching to accommodate the strain. But due to the strong bonding within the crystal structure, it snaps back to it's original shape.  A liquid metal would react completely differently. It wouldn't snap back, because the molecules are not bound in a crystal structure. It would just sag and stay deformed.  Science is whack, yo."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mqnme,PointyOintment,8,Wed Nov 19 15:31:47 2014 UTC,"Works the same as a heat exchanger, yeah? And forgive my ignorance: why would you be boiling beer?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mqnme,landaaan,20,Wed Nov 19 17:21:50 2014 UTC,"To make beer. In order to ferment something you need sugar, it's what the yeast converts to alcohol.   You take barley grain and soak it in cold water until it germinates and starts to grow. This causes the seed to release enzymes that break down the highly concentrated energy stores (starch) into smaller energy molecules (sugars) that are easier get energy from.  Once the grain has started to grow small roots this process has begun, so you dry the grain out and grind the tiny roots off. At this point you can toast some of the grain for different flavors and blend different grains.  Now you have to turn half grown dried out seeds into a liquid that you can ferment. So you put it in a big bucket of water and boil it up. This extracts all the sugars into the liquid. Hops are added for flavor, depending on how early during the boiling process the hoops are added, different flavors are produced. Usually hoops are added at several different times during this stage.  Now you're left with a hot bucket of boiling sweet sticky liquid. You can't add yeast because it's so hot it will kill the yeast. While it is boiling it is sterile.  So you have to cool it down. But if you leave it to cool down in air you risk bacteria contaminating your beer which would spoil it. Especially as it would spend a long time at a temperature just above room temperature where bacteria can very rapidly multiply.  Therefore it is preferable to cool it very quickly so that it can be immediately transferred to a fermentation vessel in an anaerobic environment that is sterile and unfavourable for bacteria.  So that's what devices like these are for. They have two channels, one for cold running water and one for the hot sweet liquid that is to become beer. The cold water runs in channels alongside the wort and rapidly cools it"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mqnme,unusuallylethargic,10,Wed Nov 19 08:06:27 2014 UTC,"Close, but you don't want to boil the grains. You steep them in hot water, around 150f, which allows the enzymes you released during the malting process to extract the sugars. Then you boil the resulting liquid, which concentrates the sugar solution, allows bittering chemicals to be extracted from the hops, and sterilizes the liquid."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mqnme,jkdom,0,Wed Nov 19 09:22:16 2014 UTC,It depends on the type of beer your making what level you are and what flavors you want. A mash might be a bit much for a first timer.  Some people like to do a mash some like to boil.  -home brewing for 5 years.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mqnme,Sierra_Oscar_Lima,5,Wed Nov 19 13:13:29 2014 UTC,Regardless if you mash your grains or use malt extract you still boil the wort.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mqnme,Sierra_Oscar_Lima,0,Wed Nov 19 16:33:29 2014 UTC,"You steep them in hot water, around 150f, which allows the enzymes you released during the malting process to extract the sugars.    Well ""mash"" the grains but close enough."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mqnme,unusuallylethargic,2,Wed Nov 19 18:08:36 2014 UTC,"Right, it's called mashing but honestly you are steeping.  Though when you are doing extract brewing with specialty grains there is a steeping step so I understand if people want to highlight the difference"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mqnme,Sierra_Oscar_Lima,3,Wed Nov 19 16:34:43 2014 UTC,"Someone else wrote a long statement, but you don't boil beer, you boil the sugary liquid ""wort"" that will eventually be beer after fermentation."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mqnme,andrade3000,3,Wed Nov 19 16:49:24 2014 UTC,Boiling is how you get the hop taste. You do it before the fermentation step
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mqnme,girth_worm,54,Wed Nov 19 16:36:14 2014 UTC,"Almost.   Boiling isn't how you get hop taste in the beer making process, it's when you get hop taste. It can give (1)hop taste, (2)aroma, and (3)bitterness. Which varieties of hops and when you add them to the boil is what determines which of the three you get. The boil is also where you sterilize your wort, denature the active enzymes in the mash (so you don't have acetic acid), and isomerize the alpha acids in the hop plant to give your bitterness. Also you can get a ton of fresh hop aroma from ""dry-hopping"" which is done in the fermentation tank, post-fermentation.  Also, while I'm being a pedantic asshole about everything: the title says it's for cooling boiling beer to fermentation temperature- technically it's cooling wort to fermentation temperature. It's not beer until the yeast is pitched in and starts turning sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. God even I'm tired of myself.  Source: Brewer and microbrewery tour guide."

The test involves filling the vessel or pipe system with a liquid, usually water, which may be dyed to aid in visual leak detection, and pressurization of the vessel to the specified test pressure. Pressure tightness can be tested by shutting off the supply valve and observing whether there is a pressure loss. The location of a leak can be visually identified more easily if the water contains a colorant. Strength is usually tested by measuring permanent deformation of the container. Hydrostatic testing is the most common method employed for testing pipes and pressure vessels. Using this test helps maintain safety standards and durability of a vessel over time."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mde6o,3rdweal,1 point,Sat Nov 15 11:04:14 2014 UTC,"On rangefinder cameras, do you use two viewfinders and paralax to find the distance, and then focus based on that information rather than by looking through the actual lens (as on an SLR)?  I've googled it, but I really just need somebody to explain it a bit."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mde6o,TheresanotherJoswell,1 point,Sun Nov 16 01:31:07 2014 UTC,"With the rangefinders I've owned (Rollie 35s, and contax).  (It's really the opposite with light coming in, but I'm going to explain it backwards because it seems easier for me to understand this way:  The center portion of the viewfinder is split either with a prism or partially silvered mirror. So that you are looking out the main viewfinder hole and also your view is diverted across the camera body perpendicular to the view and then there is a turning mirror that directs your view out forward again.  So if that last turning mirror was set right, you'd really have one image and wouldn't really know that the center of the viewfinder was different.  But that last turning mirror  pivots with the lens focussing mechanism. Such that the perfect non-split image happens when the lens is in focus at the distance of whatever is in the middle of the viewfinder  So when you turn the lens focus and look at the center of the viewfinder, the object there will split into a double image and back to a single image when the lens is in focus.  It's an easy effect to see unless you are staring at something with no features (a wall). Also if you want what's in focus to not be in the middle, you focus on the object, then compose."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2mde6o,HotAssaultedNuts,1 point,Sun Nov 16 02:46:21 2014 UTC,"It depends on the camera, but most of them since WW2 (like the M3) have the rangefinder (how you find the focusing distance) and the viewfinder (what you use to compose) combined into one. This shows the viewfinder of a Leica M3, to focus, you aim the rangefinder spot in the middle at your subject and turn the focusing ring until the two images perfectly overlap. Once that's done, use the outer framelines to compose and take the shot. On older cameras, like the Argus C3, the rangefinder spot and the viewfinder are separate.  The other windows besides the viewfinder are the rangefinder window, to gather light from a different point to gauge distance with, and the frameline window, which has a stencil cutout of the outer frame lines. The light passes through that window and is projected onto the viewfinder.  So what's the advantage of a rangefinder over an SLR?   Quieter. There's no mirror flipping and making noise. Better lenses. Because there's no gap needed for the mirror, the lens can get right next to the sensor. This makes them easier to design. Coolness. Basically the real reason people use them."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,3rdweal,156,Wed Nov 12 09:52:56 2014 UTC,And that's why you don't make your armor out of monolithic steel anymore.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,jdmgto,94,Wed Nov 12 13:04:30 2014 UTC,"Is the point of the dart to weaken the steel, so the follow up shot will penetrate and kill the crew? Also, how do current tank armours differ to deal with darts?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,JDL523,1075,Wed Nov 12 13:16:19 2014 UTC,"This is gonna get long.  No, the point of the dart is to penetrate the armor and destroy the tank. Even with modern sighting systems the odds of hitting the same hole again are incredibly small, it would really just be random chance. When the round penetrates it will be blasting chunks of the armor itself into the turret as well as the round itself. They'll all be heated from the friction of penetration and likely the dart will fragment as well. The end result is a shotgun blast of superheated metal fragments into the tank. Those chunks will ricochet off the interior of the turret and more or less mince anything they hit be it men, delicate electronics, fuel, ammo, or mechanical components. They'll kill, maim, wreck things, start fires, and depending on the design of the tank detonate some or all of the ammo. Even without a fire or ammo explosion the odds are very good that the tank will be out of action at that point.  The penetration of an APFSDS or HEAT round is such that monolithic armor is no longer viable. The thickness you'd have to have to withstand these rounds reliably is about 800mm. Even with well sloped armor it's completely non-viable to build a tank with a glacis a foot thick of solid steel and a turret face two or three feet thick. Your tank would be about as mobile as a pillbox and since it's just monolithic steel you're just fucked if they roll out a slightly better round.  So modern armor is layered. How its layered, what various layers are made of, how they're shaped, it's all played pretty close to the vest so that your enemies can't figure out how to reliably penetrate it. In general though you see two major components. A ceramic layer which is primarily for defeating HEAT rounds and a heavier metal layer designed to destroy long rod penetrators ""darts"".   The ceramic layer works by disrupting the jet of metal that a HEAT round sends into the target. The ceramic doesn't fracture cleanly, leaving a ragged cavity that the jet is traveling through. The ragged cavity generates eddies in the jet of material which disipated energy and spreads the jet out. The idea is to turn a concentrated jet with tremendous kinetic force and spread it out over a much larger area. Natuarlly a lot of work has been put into designing the ceramics to maximize this effect.   The metallic layer (in the M1's case) has been described as perpendicular rods. A layer of rods laid one direction, and then another layer laid 90 degrees to it. How does this defeat a long rod penetrator? Well look at them. Most long rod penetrators have a length to diameter ratio of about 20-30:1. The idea being to put a lot of mass behind a very small contact area. Concetrate the force, defeat the armor. Well that long thin dart doesn't have a lot of shear strength. The idea behind the rods is to deflect the penetrator, even just a little. If you can do that you are putting a tremendous amount of shear on a projectile ill equipped to handle it. You can bend the penetrator, which will ruin it. You can deflect it, at which point it's going to keep hitting rods and likely fail, or, very likely, shatter it. Remember, LRP's are traveling at about twice the velocity of a rifle bullet. Muzzle velocities of over 1,700m/s are not uncommon with modern rounds. So even a small amount of deflection in the round at the tip can place a huge shear force on the penetrator and snap it in two or more pieces, none of which will now be traveling straight into the armor or have the mass to seriously jeopardize your vehicle.  There's a lot more to armor design, how the ceramics are bonded, spall liners, etc, but those are the two main parts.  Both layers will have some effect on the rounds fired at them but in general one does better than the other against certain threats. This design also lets you put armor in ""modules"" allowing you to pull damaged armor and replace it easily. I think, and I'm sure someone will tell me I'm wrong, that the usual method is to mount the ceramics on the outside with the heavy metals backing it. The ceramics are easier to pull and replace so if they can stop the round you're better off doing it vs. the heavy metals which can deform and become very difficult to remove. Ceramics when hit tend to shatter, metal deforms.  One thing you'll notice, all this layering results in a relatively thick armor system.  So it's still not feasible to surround a tank completely in armor. It's also rather ""slope agnostic"", ie. sloping it doesn't really do much for it, in fact it can be a bad thing as you'll damage more ceramic tiles with a sloped hit and deflection than you would with a straight on hit. Hence you're seeing a lot of slab sided tanks now a days.    Edit    Well damn, thanks for the gold."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,500ft_tall_creature,45,Wed Nov 19 15:19:11 2014 UTC,"Don't forget about reactive armor which is meant to disrupt the straight flight path of the projectile.  If you can meet the penetrator with a reactive explosive force that is enough to simply disrupt the flight path of the projectile, there is a great chance you can stop it from completely defeating your armor."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,beardedbaconman,87,Wed Nov 12 19:17:27 2014 UTC,"Actually the explosive has very little to do with it. Sounds strange but the frontal plate of the ERA is what's really doing the stopping. Most ERA is applied at an angle, even on slab sided tanks ERA will be put on at an angle. Against HEAT rounds the concept is this, the jet of material from the warhead pierces the first plate of the ERA. It's got enough energy to detonate the explosive sandwiched between the outer and inner plates. The outer plate is blown off, but at an angle. This forces the jet to keep cutting through fresh material, but the real killer is that you get a similar disruption of the jet as with ceramic armor. The lower portion of the jet will be in contact with the plate, cutting through the material while the upper portion isn't hitting anything. Again, eddies are set up in the jet that start to disperse it, widening it until it lacks the force to penetrate the tank's armor.   Against a long rod penetrator and with heavier impact plates the effect is to have the plate moving at an angle to the LRP and shear it in half. Not stop it, just snap it in half.  That's just the simplest idea behind reactive armor. There's a lot of study into ways to make it safer for nearby troops and more resistant to things like tandem charge warheads."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,jdmgto,13,Wed Nov 12 20:26:49 2014 UTC,I should have been more clear with my reply concerning flight disruption.  Your last comment about making it safer for troops is why a lot of tanks only have reactive armor on the turret and bolt-on composite everywhere else (that and angular deflection on the hull-up portion of the vehicle just makes sense for combat).
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,beardedbaconman,3,Wed Nov 12 21:46:04 2014 UTC,The mechanism of the flying ERA plate against HEAT isn't so much that it disrupts the jet directly but that the plate strikes the mouth of the jet which is forming and ejecting the jet and deforms it so that it cant produce a focused jet any more.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,Eblumen,26,Wed Nov 12 20:18:34 2014 UTC,"No. Old school solid projectiles are impotent against modern armor. A full bore sized round is going to be traveling much slower. Since the relevant equation is F=(m/2)v2 you can see that the greater mass of the projectile is off set by it's lower velocity. The mass term is just sitting there but you're squaring the velocity. Double the mass and keep the velocity the same and you impart double the force. Keep the mass the same and double the velocity and you hit four times harder. That's half the idea behind an APFSDS round. You use the amount of propellant you normally would for a solid projectile, but use a much smaller one and as a result you get a much higher velocity. The other half of the equation is making the projectile long and then so you keep the density per unit area high but the area actually hit low. Since P=F/A by minimizing the area you can amplify the pressure for a given force.  An old style slug is a comparatively slow moving and low density round compared to a modern APFSDS round."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,PointyOintment,8,Thu Nov 13 01:11:25 2014 UTC,"It's delivering all the kinetic energy to a smaller spot, so it's effectively transferring more energy to the target."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,SmokeyUnicycle,8,Thu Nov 13 01:56:42 2014 UTC,"Yes, but that's not what I was asking about. The claims are that because APFSDS rounds are lighter than other rounds, they go faster for the same launch energy (same amount of propellant) (which is true), and that because they're lighter and faster, they carry more kinetic energy to deliver to the target than other rounds do (which is impossible if they were launched with the same amount of energy). Kinetic energy density (KE divided by frontal area) was not part of what I was asking about, though you're right that that's how they produce more pressure on impact."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,PointyOintment,5,Thu Nov 13 02:16:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah I agree, they don't magically pack more force into the propellant.   He's somehow missing that in order to have 4 times the energy you need... 4 times the energy."

You turn the PE of the propellant into KE, Heat Energy, Chemical Energy, and Sound Energy. You're also sending energy in tons of different directions. What the APFSDS has in it's favor is that it is VERY VERY dense. So every joule / newton of energy put into the APFSDS has a higher return rate. The formula for KE is 1/2*(Mass)(Velocity2). So while they may have similar V's (which they don't due to reduced air drag etc on the APFSDS), the multiplying factor is much much higher.   TL;DR, APFSDS is much heavier, and travels much faster, which gets squared. Thus higher KE."

The vast majority if the energy from the propellant already goes into noise and heat and so on, and even more so does with a heavier projectile.  Running very rough maths on Wolfram Alpha, the propellant has about 30 MJ of energy, and the dart exiting the muzzle about 3 MJ of kinetic energy, so a round twice as heavy and have the speed would have 95% of the energy wasted instead of 90%, not something you'd really notice."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,Eblumen,3,Thu Nov 13 16:34:24 2014 UTC,"I heard that things like water and sand become harder the more force you hit them with. Would it be possible to put these into armour plates, imagine 1x1ft plates with a little section of sand in the front/middle.  Then again the sand would probably just get dragged through and turned into a deadly mist."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,shawnaroo,9,Wed Nov 12 20:49:14 2014 UTC,"That's not really true, it's just that water and sand are pretty darn heavy, so they're decent at stopping projectiles. Steel is heavier and denser, so it's usually better. You generally get more stopping power with less volume. And then add in modern ceramics and you've got a much better solution. I'd feel much safer behind a few inches of composite armor than behind a few inches of sand or water.  Water isn't really used all that much as a form of armor, but sandbags are very common for fortifications. The big advantage with sand is that it's usually readily available, really cheap, and any idiot can help shovel it into bags and stack them to make a wall. Those considerations are less significant when you're talking about a high-tech tank built in a factory with a budget of millions of dollars."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,Valthek,2,Thu Nov 13 15:05:16 2014 UTC,"You're confusing density and stoppin with the properties of liquids and solids. Gasses, such as air, can be compressed into a smaller volume. Neither liquids nor solids have this property. The worst you can do to a liquid is displace it while solids generally just deform or get pushed around as a result of an impact.    What makes water seem so hard when it's struck with enough force is that, in order to displace water, it needs time to go places. When it gets hit by an object going fast enough, there just isn't any time and it'll react much like a solid for the first few milliseconds before finally spreading out.   Same goes for sand. Even though sand is technically a solid (at least, the individual grains are) because it's made up of a large number of small particles that can move in an individual manner, it tends to behave not unlike a liquid when presented with a foreign object. If you have a pool filed with sand and you slowly introduce a foreign object, the sand will displace. This is not because it's a gas and gets compressed or because it's a liquid and gets displaced, it's because you're moving individual grains (lots of them).  If you smack a pile of sand, like water's individual atoms , the individual grains don't have time to move and it feels solid.     But compared to something like steel, it's still really easy to move sand or water, which is why you haven't seen any armor made of sand or water."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,500ft_tall_creature,1 point,Thu Nov 13 02:55:17 2014 UTC,"I could be wrong, but with the same energy a heavier slower shell should travel further and deliver more total energy due to having greater momentum, correct?   I.e if you fire 2 shells with an energy of 100 Kg*m/s2:  You can send a 25kg object off at 2m/s  or a 1kg object off at 10m/s  This means the object that is 1/25th as heavy only goes 5 times as fast.  So momentum = mass times velocity, the momentum of the heavier 25kg object will be 25 * 2 or 50, while the momentum of the lighter one 1 * 10, or 10. In terms of delivering greater energy at a distance, the heavier object is more efficient.  I think however, that APFSDS rounds have similar weight to other shells, I'm pretty sure they are just more dense, and thus have less surface area relative to their mass. This way, firstly, it loses less energy due to air resistance/friction, and secondly has the same momentum, and thus is traveling faster when it hits the target, as well as concentrating the energy in a smaller area. This is just speculation on my part though, I have no idea how much ye olde' AP/APCR round would have weighed."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,jdmgto,2,Thu Nov 13 15:35:44 2014 UTC,"Well it's hard to say as no one makes those kind of rounds anymore. I've got some data on German anti-tank rounds from WWII but again, WWII so it's about 70 years out of date.   There's a lot of issues here, in general Long Rod Penetrators are made out of the densest material the maker can get their hands on. Depleted Uranium is fantastic since it's pyrophoric and extremely dense. So the rounds are lighter than a solid shot, but not as much as their diameter would suggest. Modern US LRP's are so long they extend deep into the propellant of the round.  Aerodynamics are also a huge part as the long thin dart of an LRP is much more aerodynamic than your average solid shot. Also, for range, while having a higher mass does help some with maintaining velocity with regards to aerodynamic drag you're fighting gravity the same as everything else to the tune of a steady -9.8m/s2. So you win some with higher mass but lose a lot due to lower velocity to begin with.  Finally, there's effective range. Extremely long range for a tank on tank engagement would be 5 kilometers. At that range most of these factors are a non issue and it's about defeating the armor, which APFSDS shells have a tremendous advantage at."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,500ft_tall_creature,1 point,Wed Nov 19 16:14:29 2014 UTC,"That could be it. Even if the APFSDS round didn't bring the energy to the target quite as efficiently, it still penetrates better due to putting it in so much smaller of an area. Plus I'm not sure if my thoughts about the momentum are even relevant, inertia and momentum are the same so I think the benefit from higher momentum might actually be cancelled out by the drawback of higher inertia."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,bpj1805,1 point,Wed Nov 19 17:18:25 2014 UTC,"I.e if you fire 2 shells with an energy of 100 Kg*m/s2   The unit of energy is the Joule (J), equivalent to kg*m2 /s2. Let's assume you meant 100 Joules.   You can send a 25kg object off at 2m/s   ½mv2 is 50J; with 100J you would have 2.83m/s   or a 1kg object off at 10m/s   100J would give 14.1m/s  Your relative factors are okay though.   In terms of delivering greater energy at a distance, the heavier object is more efficient.   You're contradicting yourself, confusingly. Ordinarily this wouldn't matter and people would organically figure out that by ""energy"" you mean ""force"" or whatever, but we're doing physics here so we can't afford that sort of sloppiness:   with the same energy a heavier slower shell should travel further and deliver more total energy   Distance doesn't matter except for influencing the aerodynamic losses.   This means the object that is 1/25th as heavy only goes 5 times as fast.   Yes, this is the correct tradeoff when you have a fixed energy budget. But rocket propellant doesn't give you a fixed (kinetic) energy budget - it's more like a fixed momentum budget.   has the same momentum, and thus is traveling faster when it hits the target   NO! If two objects have the same mass and the same momentum, they are travelling at the same speed!

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,bpj1805,1 point,Mon Nov 24 19:58:28 2014 UTC,"What is a fixed momentum budget compared to a kinetic energy budget?   A given amount of rocket propellant does contain a fixed amount of chemical potential energy, but that doesn't all get transformed into kinetic energy of the projectile. Much of the energy gets wasted as thermal energy (microscopic kinetic energy) in the exhaust - and also kinetic energy of the bulk of the exhaust (macroscopic). It's far more useful to characterize a rocket motor by the impulse that it can impart to a projectile - a force applied over time. You can use a given amount of fuel either to push gently for a long time, or to push hard for a short time. The momentum your projectile has at the end of the burn is the same. That's why the propellant your rocket has (whether the motor travels with the projectile as in a powered missile, or stays behind as in a gun) a momentum budget more than an energy budget.   does the lighter shell or heavier shell travel further, and which one hits harder?   If they both start with the same kinetic energy: the lighter shell travels further, because its velocity is higher, so it can get further before it falls back to Earth. But aerodynamics can complicate things again, depending on the shape and density of the projectiles.  If they both start with the same momentum: the lighter shell travels further, even more so than with equal kinetic energy.  If they both start with the same velocity: they travel an equal distance in a vacuum, but since we have air, this time it's the heavier shell that travels further, since the aerodynamic drag decellerates it slower.  Which one ""hits harder"" depends very much on what you mean by ""hitting harder"". Sometimes you want to deliver energy, like when you're nuking a city. Other times you want to deliver force/pressure, like when you want to pierce armour. Yet other times you want a combination, like when you want to pierce armour and then also do a bunch of damage once you're inside the tank. I can't think of military applications of wanting to deliver momentum. You'd want that if you're trying to move an asteroid, maybe."

In the end modern spalling rounds changed armor entirely, solid armor doesn't stand up to spalling at all, the major point to chobham layers is to encounter the round early, effect it slightly (as in your post), but also deal with any remaining weapon effects in the internal layers. The high speed penetrators like the APFSDS are the biggest threat to Chobham."

Is there a economics of offense where infantry with low power weapons can damage the surface of a tank sufficiently to leave it in need of (expensive) repair albeit at a high risk of dying themselves.  For asymetric warfare this might be a viable way to defeat tanks. A jihadi with a AK47 (cheap) could do huge financial damage to a tank if this was the case. War is also a financial conflict. There is a theory that most empires have fallen when their conquered lands require more money to police than they give back in tribute or tax.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,Anonymous3891,18,Mon Dec 15 03:23:41 2014 UTC,To expand on your point the reason why depleted uranium is very good for kinetic penetrators is because it's very very dense so can have a massive amount of kinetic energy if travelling at high enough speeds.

Though if you make it through the ERA a bigger sub munition like that is going to have more difficulty with the ceramic layer. Trade off's I suppose. Though if your target is older tanks with ERA being used to try and keep them relevant that'd be an effective way to deal with it.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,TheRighteousTyrant,3,Wed Nov 12 13:32:44 2014 UTC,"i wonder if they're using some kind of dual-layer sabot - something narrow and hard, like DU, on the inside to defeat the ceramics and normal armors, and something comparatively soft on the outside to give the sabot more thickness/rigidity to not be disturbed by ERA tiles and other active/passive defenses. I honestly have no clue, just a thought of the top of my head."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2m26t9,Shpadoinkles,7,Wed Nov 12 15:19:22 2014 UTC,"The energy needed to spin a projectile robs it of velocity and therefore penetrative power, and in any case spinning a projectile this long does little to help stabilize it.

Since the metal is so dense, it has a lot of kinetic energy.  When it penetrates a tank's armor it goes in and explodes into hot shrapnel (lots of energy being transferred) that goes all through the interior.  A 113 is a light aluminum armored vehicle.  Using Tungsten or DU rounds on them is such overkill, it's like shooting a water bottle with a gun.  The bullet is going to go through both sides with little resistance, and anything that was in the way is going to get carried out through the back hole, and that much stuff going out the bigger hole faster than the little hole can fill with air is going to create a vacuum"

It also has (at least) two holes in it... why would the salsa proceed to blow out through the holes?  Vacuum would tend to keep it IN.  I'm guessing there's quite a bit of meaty mess left inside the vehicle, and the horror of seeing  even a small portion of a body blown out the bigger exit back hole gets exaggerated, and described as 'sucked out the hole'.

EVER.  An old acquaintance of my father spent 5 years in federal prison over unlicensed manufacture of a suppressor. He was a gunsmith by education, had a drug problem, and badly needed money. Someone approached him asking him to make one for a lot of money and they turned out to be an informant. This happened in the 1970s.   People think the ATF is fucking around -- they do not fuck around. In the words of Dennis Reynolds, they will ""jam you up so hard"" for violating the NFA.   In college I was at a party once at some frat kids house. The keg was in the garage, and so was his Porsche 944, so as we're standing around, he very casually pulls an AK out of the back of his car and proudly tells us he modified it to be fully automatic. Now I don't know if he was telling the truth or not, but I tried to explain to him that he could spend a lot of time in a federal pound-me-in-the-ass prison for doing that and that if he knew what was good for him he would set it back and just pretend he had never done it. In typical young idiot fashion, he felt invincible and that nothing could go wrong. There are a lot of people out there who think they can get away with breaking THIS particular law (NFA), but when you get busted, the consequences are severe."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lyo58,Aeleas,6,Tue Nov 11 16:58:49 2014 UTC,"It's to allow for cleaning.  IIRC, it is the baffles of a suppressor that is the regulated part since they are what reduces the sound pressure from firing.  So in order to be able to change calibers with a different set of baffles one has to file paperwork with the BATFE in order to possess the second set.  It's this reason that people typically go for the bigger caliber suppressor if they wish to suppress multiple calibers (e.g. a baffle set sized for a .45ACP being used with 9mm and .45ACP caliber pistols).  There are some drawbacks to doing this but when you're having to spend $600+ on the suppressor and $200 for the tax stamp, this is the better compromise."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lyo58,aakrusen,3,Tue Nov 11 17:43:07 2014 UTC,"You also have to keep in mind that it isn't shooting .223/5.56, 7.62 is significantly larger. Pretty amazing."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lyo58,hazmatte,6,Tue Nov 11 21:06:16 2014 UTC,"Why it doesn't basically comes down to 'bullet go fast'.   Even with subsonic ammunition you are looking at 700 to 1000 feet per second, so even if your suppressor is a full foot long the bullet goes through it in less than two milliseconds, immediately after firing. So its gone before any recoil is moving the gun."

You can see how the expanding gasses are trapped by the baffles as the bullet passes through them, allowing them to expand and cool down, losing pressure and therefore reducing noise.  edit: As was correctly pointed out, this is not actually an X-Ray image but rather a special suppressor made with a transparent tube."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lyr7r,Votearrows,5,Tue Nov 11 13:56:44 2014 UTC,"Is the gas generating, absorbing or reflecting x-rays here? Or is it not really x-rays, but some other sort of penetrating EM radiation?"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lyr7r,majorscheiskopf,1 point,Wed Nov 12 06:12:43 2014 UTC,"I am by no means an expert on X-rays, but the explanation which makes most sense to me is that the gas is dense enough to reflect the x-rays projected at it. With x-rays, the greater the reflection, the brighter the image. Here, I believe the amount of reflection depends on density, so we see where the gas is collecting most."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lyr7r,jrlp,2,Wed Nov 12 00:01:07 2014 UTC,"No. That's not how x-rays work.  You have the x-ray source -> thing to be imaged -> screen -> film.  The film is white as a native state. As the x-rays go through the object to be imaged, they get absorbed by the material. Different densities and crystal arangements cause x-rays to be absorbed in different amounts. The remainder of the x-rays continue through the object, eventually illuminating the film.  Think of a typical medical x-ray. The film has a black background, and bones and areas of high density are white.  http://i.imgur.com/yfEEMPi.jpg  Typical x-ray of a hand. The denser areas absorb more x-rays, which means less x-rays strike the film. Areas that do not absorb as much x-rays are shaded. Areas that do not absorb any x-rays are completely invisible, as all you see is the hand in this picture.  The bones show white because they absorb far more of the energy than does skin and muscle. The air around the hand is invisible because they do not absorb any.  On the side view, there is far more soft tissue absorbing the x-rays than the top-down view, because the hand is thicker in that direction, which is why you can see the shading/outlining of the hand easier, while in the first picture the fingertips and nails are invisible."

The Sparrow is marketed for long rifles, but the gun in the video is a [centerfire] semiautomatic handgun which cannot possibly use [rimfire] .22 LR as you describe .22 LR, but there's no way to know that the round fired in the video is .22 LR without seeing the chamber or casing.  Also, there were no x-rays involved in the shooting at all. From the manufacturer's official YouTube account:   We machined a plastic tube made from bulletproof glass. Then used a high speed camera to shoot 30,000 frames per second."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lit7o,griz120,16,Fri Nov 7 00:08:44 2014 UTC,"I wonder how far they shoot if you point it into the air.  By comparison the water pressure at the bottom of the Marianas Trench is only 15,000 psi.  You'd need an ocean 22 miles deep to get 55,000 psi.  Also if you triple the pressure in that waterjet, liquid can no longer even exist at room temperature and you end up with Ice VI in your compressor."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lit7o,hodyoaten,16,Fri Nov 7 02:47:02 2014 UTC,"yup.   currently 90-100K is achievable with the best pumps. (this is for industrial, realistic purposes) and even then the seals and check valves only last for weeks.   Until someone finds the smoking gun of ultra high pressure seals this is going to be the ceiling of waterjets for a while.   Ive spoken to people who experimented with using steam, and they couldnt achieve the depth of cut of current waterjets, the water would disperse and loose its form and result in a bad uncontrollable edge finish."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lit7o,deadpoetic333,2,Fri Nov 7 02:56:56 2014 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what's the price range on these waterjets and what kind of applications are they most likely to be used for? You mention a ceiling has been reached for waterjets, are more powerful jets desirable for certain things that currently can't be done or would it just make things go quicker?"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lit7o,deadpoetic333,8,Fri Nov 7 17:57:01 2014 UTC,"Waterjets have only been common in manufacturing for a few decades, compared to other processes and machinery its still baby, but already they're carving out a niche in industry.   They're used in sterile environments, food handling (cutting meat) since the water can be sanitized and all components are stainless steel they easily meet most food saftey requirements for use with human consumed food.    I cut test samples for tensile strength testing for a couple different labs.  Waterjets have a wonderful side effects of governing the temperature of the material you cut.   While using a drill or endmill/ fly, grinding wheel and saws  generate a large amount of heat, for the purposes of many tests the amount of heat generated can case-harden and change the material, so in the case of tensile strength tests  the material you cut to test has changed from the material of the actual component, so you literally arent testing the same metal, one is case hardened and one is at manufactures heat treat specifications.  They're used for semi rapid prototyping.  We use ours to save time in developing new car parts, and our customers will often have us make 120 pieces of a prototype part so they can have 10 pieces sent for 12 different kinds of tests.   With a .030 inch diameter water stream, its very little wasted material which means you be more economical with the material you've purchased.  We do work with Inconel, which is the metal they used to make turbine blades.  Its very expensive.  The waterjet makes great work.  Being a CNC machine it can cut a profile with many different radii seamlessly and with ease.  We can cut anything, except diamonds.  But give me 20 pounds of crushed diamonds and I can give you 40 minutes worth of cutting, however im sure the focusing tubes would erode from the diamonds, they're usually made of tungsten carbide  Our machine is has a 6x12 foot cutting envelope 8in' Z travel (thickness),  with .003in accuracy for every 3 feet.  I cut 1/4 inch thick aluminum at about 33 inches per minute.  and that gives you an edge that looks straight, smooth, but with a sandblasted appearance.  that'll cost about 350,000 dollars US, once everything is said and done.   The pumps arent the be-all and end-all of faster and better waterjet machines.  If we could use little tiny diamonds instead of crushed rocks we could get faster cutting speeds.  The water doesnt do the cutting, the abrasive does.  So maybe the best way to get better waterjets isnt to just get more pressure (in essence running your sawblade at a higher RPM)  The ceiling i was referring to was only that the pumps we can make leak too easily, but there are lots of ways we can still improve the technology, what I really like is that its still so new they're improving in leaps and bounds  If you had a pump with 90,000psi and a .040 tube pushing 2 pounds of sand (at the cost of .60-1.80$) per minute you can cut really fast.  and that means more parts per hour, more parts, mo-mo-mo-more money."

The water and abrasive (crushed rocks) will go through your veins, if they get lodged in a capillary vein It will clog it and I slowly cause cell death. so the doctor will have to cut me open and do some exploring. Definately rather cut myself on a saw.     The service tech who installed our newest machine was telling me of a mod they did for a shop in Kansas where they changed the Z axis travel to 24 inches!  This gave the cutting head enough height that with its current angle of motions it could shoot a bead right off the side of the machine and at the operator.  The manufacturer made them sign a waver and install light-curtains on the sides.   However most waterjets dont recycle cutting  water, the water in the tank is left there to dampen the sound of the machine as it can easily exceed 110 dB.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lheli,BattleHall,4,Fri Nov 7 01:37:11 2014 UTC,"In addition to what others have said, if you understand how a normal car (piston) engine works, it helps to think of it like this: Piston engines have the entire compression/ignition/expansion cycle in one location and separate them in time (sequentially), while jet engines have the same steps (compression => ignition => expansion), only they are happening simultaneously/continuously and are separated by location."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lheli,HughJorgens,5,Fri Nov 7 01:48:04 2014 UTC,The compressor blades (on the left) suck air in and compress it.  The compressed air is mixed with fuel and burned (in the middle)  The hot air expands  and rushes out the back because that way has less pressure.  On the way it turns the stator blades (on the right) which powers the compressor blades.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lheli,powder1,1 point,Fri Nov 7 10:27:57 2014 UTC,Air comes in (the fan stages in the front are called the compressor) and gets compressed (high pressure)/slowed down at the same time so it can be burned. Then in the middle there are combustion chambers which mix the fuel with the air and ignites it. The gases produced by the combustion accelerate out the aft of the engine which does 2 things. 1. turns the forward fans (turbine section) creating more air being drawn into the engine(from the compressor) as well as accelerate the engine forward. That's pretty much it. Suck. Squeeze. Bang. Blow.

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lekib,TheAlmightyFur,13,Wed Nov 5 23:11:46 2014 UTC,"I couldn't say from experience but I suspect that once the upper pin is locked in the upper chamber there would be less resistance & spring force acting on the lower pin as it can freely move, which you can probably feel."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lekib,starfries,4,Wed Nov 5 23:23:49 2014 UTC,Pretty much. Definitely easier on locks with loose tolerances because the pin chambers won't be drilled in a perfectly straight line and will bind independently as you separate the top and bottom pins at the shear line.

Yeah, you can replace it with some cheap Wal-Mart lock in case of breakage, but what if your lock was part of the keyed alike scheme of the rest of your house? Or what about if you were renting and the original lock was in a funky 'aged bronze satin' finish that they're going to take out of your deposit? What if it's part of a master key system in your apartment and maintenance has to break your door frame or drill the lock when your upstairs neighbor overflows their bathtub while you're at work?  Amateurs are better off buying that Wal-Mart lock from the beginning and practicing on that, honestly.   I will add that as a former locksmith, I used to pick the cylinder over and insert a key that was smoothly milled to the deepest cut depth to alleviate top pins falling/pushing though the bottom of the key slot."

The top tool is either a pick or a rake, he's moving it around in order to move the tumblers into the correct positions, but why does this work?   Well no lock can be made perfectly and each pin and hole is a slightly different diameter, by applying tension and moving the pins into the correct position the barrel can shift slightly holding each pin in place. It ends up being a different combination for each lock.   You might notice that he has every pin aligned except for the first and last, he moves the last pin up to the correct position but it slips down, this is because the first pin is larger than the last, disallowing the minute barrel movement needed to hold it in place. Once he gets the first pin in place he easily gets the last in and the lock opens.   Now you know what's going on!"

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lekib,JosephPalmer,21,Thu Nov 6 01:01:36 2014 UTC,The wrench in the lock is twisting the lock barrel.  This causes a small ledge to form that the top pins catch on.  The real trick of lock picking is putting the right amount of torque on the wrench so that the pins catch on the lip without so much torque that they will get jammed in the middle.

These instruments are used to measure vertical and horizontal angles. The horizontal and vertical plates are in light blue and will have angle marks on them, these are very accurate instruments so the angles will be broken down into minutes and seconds.  Your target would be sighted through the main telescope, and then you would look through the reading scope on the left, the optical path for the vertical measurement is the yellow dotted line, and the red dotted line is the path to the horizontal plate. Both of these plates are illuminated by the mirror on the side, light is bounced into the instrument and onto the measurement plates.  The red dotted line on the right that goes out the bottom is the path for the optical plummet, this is used when you are setting up the instrument to make sure its over the point you will be measuring from.  Of course these optical paths have been replaced with electronic encoders that read the plates and display the angular measurement on a LCD screen."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,ozonesmog,40,Wed Nov 5 00:52:40 2014 UTC,Cool. What are the benefits of the different blade types?
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,glial,36,Wed Nov 5 02:08:45 2014 UTC,"I'm a metallurgist with a background in making impact and wear resistant gears which are actually pretty similar to a Katana in design.   The edge is high carbon so it can be hardened then tempered a bit so you've go an edge that will stay sharp but is not so brittle that it chips with impact. The folded designed is used to make sure the steel is homogeneous. With early steels it's very easy to get non uniform distribution of alloying elements (alloy segregation) so the folding and forge welding attempts to eliminate that. Non uniform steel can form brittle crack prone structure. The folded sections could possibly be work hardened from all the pounding to form stronger structures (dislocations) in the steel. The center is soft, very ductile and able to bend and move as the blade encounters impacts. Something does not need to be super strong if it can bend against a force.Think of a fragile grass in a gusty wind. The medium steel opposite the blade I'm not so sure about it's functionality."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,Katapesh_Express,4,Wed Nov 5 04:21:45 2014 UTC,"I think the medium steel may be to reduce damage from blows of the opponents sword on the spine, encouraging the edge to glance off or chip rather than cut into soft iron. There are examples remaining today of blades with gouges in the spine, even with pieces of edge embedded in them.  Edit: From what I've seen, the Kobuse construction is the most common and IMO makes the most sense from a construction standpoint (forging and heat treatment). The construction used in the main example may be designed that way for aesthetic reasons and I'm not even sure if it would have a hamon."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,squilliam132457,2,Wed Nov 5 04:58:58 2014 UTC,"You could probably do that with a thin layer of soft steel along the entire back edge instead of just making the core soft, though. Even the flatter shape of the spine could be enough to make a difference in chipping a blade. The Katana was intended to be drawn and used quickly, and although I am hardly a historical combat expert, I do not see spine-to-edge contact as a common occurrence as compared to edge-to-edge.  I agree with you that the Kobuse construction makes a lot of sense. It's much less complicated and still provides the benefits of composite (in a loose sense of the word) construction. However, the internals of the blade have fairly little to do with the aesthetics, with the exception of differential cooling causing the characteristic bend. Most of the composition differences are hidden inside the blade.   It would be really cool to design a Katana using CAD and finite element analysis, now that materials science is fairly advanced. Not very useful, but it would be interesting to see how the older blades matched up with a more modern design."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,Dilong-paradoxus,3,Wed Nov 5 06:25:22 2014 UTC,"You could probably do that with a thin layer of soft steel along the entire back edge instead of just making the core soft, though.   What could you do? What do you mean?  On your second paragraph: I was thinking that the 'folded steel' sides would be created to give a forge welded pattern that we commonly see today, referred to as Damascus. This would have an aesthetic influence on the blade and would also create a lamination line above the edge which may starkly contrast the polishing of softer and hard steel, if the side steel didn't harden as much as the edge. Depending on the composition of the side steel it may not be capable of displaying a hamon which is another big aesthetic factor on a katana."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,squilliam132457,2,Wed Nov 5 08:40:45 2014 UTC,"Steelmaker here: if I were designing a blade like that today, I'd probably make it out of 'medium carbon' steel (approx. 0.6%C or so), possibly even microalloyed with V and N, Nb/Cb or even Ti to improve austenitic grain size refinement.   Modern steelmaking practices and submerged-entry-nozzle continuous casting would ensure homogeneity and the lack of impurities (the other reason for folding the steel so many times - hammer out the slag). Hot-roll to a flat bar slighty larger than the blade, forge the blade itself, case-harden the cutting edge (maybe), automatically apply clay to back, heat-treat, quench, remove clay and temper - with induction heating, you might even be able to temper the edge and back at different rates to improve the toughness of the back of the blade. Sharpen cutting edge and attach handle to tang."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,arcedup,1 point,Wed Nov 5 23:40:19 2014 UTC,Isn't the hamon formed because of the heat treatment? (and therefore not really defined by the type of steel used)
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,C0R4x,6,Wed Nov 5 08:08:30 2014 UTC,"Steel and heat treatment must be combined to form a hamon.  1) It must have enough carbon to be able to harden during the quench.   2) Different steel alloys require different rates of cooling to harden. The quench medium is what is used to cool the steel and ""lock in"" the crystal structure. From slow to fast: Air, oil, water, brine. In Japan they usually quench in water because of the steels they use.  With the tamahagane alloy, a water quench will harden the blade, however if the steel is insulated by a later of clay it will not harden. Clay is painted onto the upper portion of the blade causing it to remain soft as it does not cool fast enough to harden. The boundary between these zones produces the visible hamon line."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,squilliam132457,2,Wed Nov 5 08:31:40 2014 UTC,The Med steel helps keep the sword from bending backwards once it strikes an object. It makes slicing do a bit more work since it wont give once it hits the target as easily. You can see that not many of the katana types use it because of the width of the sword doing that job already. The added spine also makes using the back of the sword less of an object for defense because it will chip easier.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,GenOmega,2,Wed Nov 5 04:39:33 2014 UTC,I don't know if I agree with your description. The modulus (stiffness) of steels is for the most part nearly constant across all the steel alloys. It hovers around 205 Gpa.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,Katapesh_Express,1 point,Wed Nov 5 04:49:38 2014 UTC,"It is its lack of malleability, not its stiffness that supports it."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,GenOmega,7,Wed Nov 5 05:18:15 2014 UTC,Malleability also know as ductility is the ability to be plastically (permanently) deformed. The whole thing you're trying to avoid is plastic deformation. I'm really trying to understand what you're getting at.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,Katapesh_Express,45,Wed Nov 5 05:25:52 2014 UTC,"I can't speak for individual designs, but generally the different varieties of steel help cope with external and external stresses differently to make a better blade. A single-piece blade is simple to construct, but will either dull (or bend!) if it's too soft or chip and break if it's too hard. By altering the carbon content of the steel you can make a harder or softer section intentionally. That brings us two the next iteration from the left, comprised of two sections. The outer shell is harder steel, which resists dulling. The inner section is made of softer steel, which can bend more easily, allowing the blade to flex without snapping. More complex designs allowing for finer gradations of hardness, better coping with stresses (in theory)."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,Dilong-paradoxus,50,Wed Nov 5 02:34:41 2014 UTC,This was especially necessary in Japan considering their generally low-quality sources of iron which made lower-quality steel.  These variances in layers were essential in making blades that didn't break every couple of swings.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,cuddleskunk,-86,Wed Nov 5 03:56:04 2014 UTC,"I hate to be that guy, but it'd be nice to have a thread involving katanas without someone mentioning European swords were better against an armored opponent. Sure, most people didn't own European plate armor, especially in the regions katanas saw use. I still think katanas are cooler (Though the coolest weapon in my opinion are polearms, which are kind of boring but interesting in how they shaped battlefield tactics from classical times til renaissance era.)"
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,KuntaStillSingle,60,Wed Nov 5 05:55:06 2014 UTC,"I never brought up European swords at all.  I also never mentioned armored opponents.  All I said was that Japanese iron ore sources were naturally too high in carbon and other impurities that weakened the metal rather than strengthening it.  Shit...the best steel in the world came from Syria.  The katana might be the best chopping sword ever developed (the Scimitar, Machete, and Khopesh/kopis all give it a run for its money though).  Using traditional techniques with modern steels can create wondrous katanas that would not have been possible in ancient times.  As for armored opponents...thrusting weapons are better versus armor...as long as you are looking at swords.  The best anti-armor weapons for melee were picks and hammers/maces."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,cuddleskunk,28,Wed Nov 5 06:06:02 2014 UTC,Oh I guess I just saw the low-quality iron part and then my mind just filled the rest in. Sorry.

Quality is a relative concept, therefore you need something/a state to compare it against; comparison would be contemporary iron/steel, e.g. European/Middle East or current iron/steel.  Most people given   their generally low-quality sources of iron which made lower-quality steel   would assume therefore that the sources of iron were low-quality in comparison to what was available at that time in other parts of the world.  Perhaps /u/cuddleskunk would have been better off talking about purity rather than quality but I'm not a metallurgist so not 100% sure about that."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,Nowin,1 point,Wed Nov 5 13:45:53 2014 UTC,"There's a trade off in material properties when dealing with steel. There's the steel's hardness, which is it's ability to resist penetration. It's also what allows the blade to hold a sharp edge. The trade off is that the harder the steel the more brittle it is. I've literally seem hardened tools come back from production lines that look like shattered glass. Many times in modern fabrication, a technique called case hardening is used where the exterior of the metal is hardened but the interior is left soft. This allows the outside of the piece to be hard and not shear so easily but allows flexibility from the soft steel in the center. This is the same principle in the swords. If they were made from super hardened steel throughout, they would be prone to breakage. This allows that weapons to flex.  edit: and I just realized that Dilong-paradoxus already answered."
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,shitflavoredlollipop,14,Wed Nov 5 15:35:27 2014 UTC,Katanas... The croissant of the sword world!  ... the secret is to rub butter on each layer before folding...

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,UndeadCaesar,28,Wed Nov 5 09:46:43 2014 UTC,"I did a senior thesis project on the metalworking of katanas. My favorite fact is that during the quenching process, the smith will paint lines of a clay mixture perpendicular to the edge, running to the spine of the blade. When the metal is quenched, this metal under the clay will cool at a slower rate than the surrounding metal and form a different sort of microstructure that is more ductile. If the sword were to impact another sharp edge (like another sword) any cracks that would propagate down the length of the blade (which would be really shitty for the wielder) will stop at these fingers of microstructure. This compartmentalization helps the katana stay useful through an entire combat period and not fracture at the first hit."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,the_mollusque,9,Wed Nov 5 04:03:26 2014 UTC,Swords of every kind got to be pretty complex starting with at least the middle ages. Katanas are mostly late-middle ages weapons (being invented in the 12th century) so blacksmiths kind of knew what they were doing. :)
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,SeeShark,2,Wed Nov 5 14:09:49 2014 UTC,I realize this now.  I guess I had just never thought about it before.

We forget that swords were the primary weapon of choice for thousands of years, and everyone was trying to make a better sword over that entire time period. We just lump all swords together as just 'swords', which would be akin to lumping a musket with an AK-47 into the same category of 'gun' and calling them equivalent."

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,elguapo1991,-2,Wed Nov 5 04:31:47 2014 UTC,"It kinda makes you wonder: How many generations of expert craftsmen did it take to reach this level of complexity?

ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2lbhzc,jdmgto,3,Wed Nov 5 23:29:12 2014 UTC,"Hobby blacksmith here.  They are a single piece folded and flattened out via hammering.

Although I can't comment on the thin line you're talking about, the horizontal composition of the blade would not have an effect on the hamon of the blade.

Did Han Solo do the Kessel in 12 parsecs? It doesn't make sense (yeah I know travel close to balck holes shortens the path or whatever) and it might just be Han bragging himself up. Were Han and Lando friends before or were they rivals that respected each other but Han had to go to him for help because he was desperate. Maybe he just told Leia he was a friend to keep her calm.  A world with myths and legends is more real. It isn't counter productive for the author to include them in his world building.
ThingsCutInHalfPorn,2l8kw6,yetkwai,3,Wed Nov 5 02:17:40 2014 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing that it could add something, I'm just saying it's not always easy to do. Obviously it's better to show than to tell, since it removes ambiguity and feels less lazy, but you can't show everything.   And if the reader/viewer is still learning about the rules of a world, how are they to tell what's fact-within-the-fiction and what's fiction-within-the-fiction? We can't go off our own judgment because sci-fi and fantasy quite decidedly contain many things that would be impossible/exaggerated in our world. So if characters tell us that there's both a space station as large as a moon and a beast that takes 1,000 years to digest you, how are we supposed to know which one is fact and which one isn't?   You could try to flag every bit of legend or myth with a phrase like, ""Legend has it...,"" but authors tend to use that sort of thing as a way to introduce an especially out-there truth about the universe that maybe even the characters shouldn't assume is real, but still turns out to be."

It lives in the middle of the desert so imagine there wouldn't be an abundance of large animals to feed on. Even if there were, it would be pretty easy for them to avoid it, since its only hunting strategy is waiting for things to fall into its mouth. If it didn't rely on slavers to feed it their enemies it would starve to death."

Basically, the defense arguement is that Sarlacs are almost in a constant ""Hibernation"" state where 95% of their body really isn't doing anyhing most of the time (think like a pitcher plant), and that it takes a long long time for them to get to their full size. As well, its stated that they really take their time and slowly process the nutrients of anything they do consume, making it quite viable for them to live, especially when they're used to dump bodies into, or say, an entire herd of those camel things walks into one every 200 years.  The counter arguement to that is that basically ""Thats not how energy works"" and that they would have to be hunting or finding incredible amounts of prey somewhere other than the middle of a vast desert for something remotely that size to exist."
