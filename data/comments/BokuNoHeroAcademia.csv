BokuNoHeroAcademia,3e41cq,SpiceNRICE,6,Tue Jul 21 20:05:10 2015 UTC,"Eh, you should keep this in the Prediction post for Ch. 52"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3e41cq,newmanispleased,7,Tue Jul 21 20:29:08 2015 UTC,"First off, how was Iida a dick when he was introduced? And second, I very much believe Iida's path to darkness is not over, he was so consumed by anger and vengeance that he said something a hero would never say: ""I'll kill you"" (it's in the viz translation also), and even after Stain told him about saving the hero he was about to kill, Iida didn't seem to care, he basically just said ""the life lesson your trying to give me doesn't matter even if it is important because your nothing but the guy who hurt my brother"" it really just shows you Iida's mind state at that moment and what he really thinks. Also, I think in chapter 52 we might get a better understanding of Iida thoughts and his resolve towards his goal, is it becoming a better hero? Is it ignoring everything his brother stood for and trying to kill stain? Or will he choose a different path entirely? Next chapter is looking to make some great setup for the future."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3e41cq,moopsten,3,Tue Jul 21 20:27:41 2015 UTC,"I strongly think whatever character development we see in Iida will tie in strongly with how he views Deku.  It was established that Iida respected Deku when they met after both passing the exam with Iida finding out the true meaning of the exam through Deku. Iida was also one of the people who voted for Deku to be the class president.  Also when fighting todoroki Iida still goes as far to compare himself to Deku but still lost much quicker to Todoroki.  And to top it all off Stain belittles Iida for being a ""fake"" hero by attacking Stain instead of trying to save the victim on the other hand Iida himself is saved by Deku soon afterwards."

Its not the concept of a super hero in itself I dislike, but the tropes built up over decades that are always present to varying degrees.  This is different. I like shounen manga. Naruto, One Piece, and other lesser known ones I've read occasionally.  This manga is a really well done shounen. The art is really cool, the pace is fast, and the characters are awesome. I really like it."

One of the best fights in the series ended with the MC impaled on a dude's forearm while he strangled said dude. It came down to who will black out first."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dqsmf,Duffya,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:44 2015 UTC,"I think this series does something different with superpower users since it touches on areas most usually don't but on the sly.    Female hero's identity and being self conscience about how they're seen (Momo & Hagakure (invisible girl).  What kind of ethics a hero or villain can have (it's not all about money for some but it's all about the money for others).  What can be done legally (Endeavor) Where one crosses the line from being on the level (legal hero) versus something that will get you arrested (Vigilante).  I know people have been calling out in advance which student will become a villain but what would that really mean?  They kill a suspect or catch a villain without having a license to do so?  They see something they couldn't stop puts them over the edge mentally and the do something they shouldn't.    The short version is I think it's interesting to see people with superpowers that should be larger than life just being and showing they're human.  They hate, they get jealous, they fight with each other and or criminals, they cry, they find joy, and either live (or they're stuck) in their past or press forward."

I find out some funny ones like:   Shōto literally means Burnt+Frozen Bakugō = Grand Explosion Uraraka = Bright sun which fits her personality   However, Tenya's name literally means Natural Disaster. Do you think it is some kind of foreshadowing that he will become a villian?"

That was Takayuki Furuichi's role (playing the straight man in the comedy routine) for most of the Beelzebub manga.  Would you rather someone with a more explosive personality use him as a grappling hook tied to rope.  Mineta:  Stop! My powers don't work this way!!! Katsuki:  They do now.  Throws half pint hero in training
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dnbwx,RemnantX,4,Fri Jul 17 18:58:45 2015 UTC,The author also tends to throw them together in weird situations for the sake of the gag.  Like during the cavalry battle when they just so happened to end up on the same team. Mineta got a whole little story about how he ended up teaming up with Tentacle Guy and then Tsuyu just sort of got tacked onto that because... just because I guess.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dnbwx,gangler52,2,Fri Jul 17 22:31:54 2015 UTC,"Or remember after that when Mineta somehow strung Tsuyu into participating in a fake cheerleading round, despite the fact that Tsuyu had already been knocked out of the tournament and would no longer be a part of any more rounds of any kind to come?"

In a hypothetical scenario where there was a girls-only cheering round between the cavalry round and the combat tourney, Momo would've been in it.  Tsuyu and a few other names were just sort of tacked onto that bit despite the fact that they had no reason to be there.  For Tooru it was a lone incident, but with Tsuyu it's part of a trend."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dl7sr,HokageEzio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:06:19 2015 UTC,"No, look at many famous mangas bleach, inuyasha, fairy tail, and naruto.  Think about it, orhime, Lucy, kagome, and sakura.

There's no evidence to her becoming like Sakura at this point, because, while I don't think Sakura is useless by the end of the manga (due to basically saving the day single handedly in the war), she was definitely useless in Part 1.

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dl7sr,PakiIronman,2,Fri Jul 17 16:11:24 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people make this complaint all the time honestly about naruto. The series is supposed to follow naruto not every single side character he meets while I do love kankuro (he's my favorite character) and others it would be weird if he just shoved them into every arc all the time. Some more screen time would have been cool but in reality if we are talking about what is crucial to the story, they can only put so many characters in each arc and give them something meaningful to do. Also if they don't stay focused on characters (that had already filled their job in part 1 imo) they wouldn't have time to also introduce new cool characters like killer bee. However I am very impressed with how bnha is squeezing a little screen time for everyone but if they don't get anymore development later on because the author moves onto new things I won't be upset about it."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dl7sr,ImAnAppleBiteMe,2,Fri Jul 17 13:17:18 2015 UTC,"True but i'm just worried they'll get absolutely no roles in the upcoming arcs. I'm not asking them to be in every arc, but like said i don't want his work to go  to waste."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dl7sr,ExceedMaster,3,Fri Jul 17 16:03:33 2015 UTC,That also includes ochako becoming the next sakura because it could happen.   Are we even reading the same manga?
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dl7sr,HokageEzio,4,Fri Jul 17 04:50:29 2015 UTC,There's alot of similarities.  Plus he was inspired by Kishimoto to make my hero academia
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dl7sr,InsanityRaptor,2,Fri Jul 17 13:47:45 2015 UTC,"Between ochako and sakura? Huh, no there aren't."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dl7sr,dragn99,2,Fri Jul 17 14:34:11 2015 UTC,No I mean both mangas not sakura and ochako.  Sorry for the confusion.

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dl7sr,Monimonika18,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:30:39 2015 UTC,Kankuro (as well as nearly every other side character) played a big part in the the last arc.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3dl7sr,PandaMarkII,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:53:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah but pause and think here, how many arcs were the side characters  involved in?  For example Neji (my old favorite), this fellows major role was only the final arc which was also his death thats just sad. A huge character development and role in pre-timeskip naruto but a lack of character development in shippuden"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,Lufti94,79,Thu Jul 16 16:30:06 2015 UTC,"This was a godly chapter! Endeavor appearing out of nowhere! Gran torino going all out! Three noumu's destroying the city with all might nowhere in sight! Stain wrecking ida, and ida's conviction (he probably wont go to the dark side) and memories of his bro! Last but not the least.... DEKU! Finally using OFA to attack stain! What a chapter! I have to use exclamation points at every sentence because this chapter was unbelievable! infinity/10 rating! Deku is slowly shaping up to be a hero who all might can be proud of. Horikoshi you are beyond a doubt a certified genius!"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,rastogishubham,34,Thu Jul 16 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"Totally agree!  I also noticed that in the past Deku was usually scared out of this mind, but still did what was necessary.  He was always shown to be shaking in these situations, but here he was stone cold and ready to fight!  Pretty badass reaction from him."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,wheelsAreturning,25,Thu Jul 16 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"I'm loving deku like this, his development is so well done. I feel like he has grown so much and has become a person worthy of OFA. I feel proud as if I had a part in it somehow, he is so likeable as an MC. I'll always root for him"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,rastogishubham,10,Thu Jul 16 17:57:57 2015 UTC,"Deku might stall if he's by himself and there's a villain but if someone's in trouble he goes on auto-pilot even before OFA without thinking. I'm curious if Deku will yell for Iida to help the other guy while he distracts the villain.  Then finds out they're both paralyzed and severly injured (Tenya can't pick up anyone with a piercing wound to one shoulder joint and the other bicep ""kicked open"").  It looked like Tenya was paralyzed after Stain licked Tenya's blood off his weapon. 0.o?"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,RemnantX,6,Thu Jul 16 20:28:55 2015 UTC,"You are probably right, deku will either stall or try a quick getaway"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,rastogishubham,12,Thu Jul 16 20:52:43 2015 UTC,I love how other heroes don't see Deku as a hero. That's totally how he should always be. This little guy who will surprise you.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,Thendofreason,2,Fri Jul 17 00:59:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the fact that he is relatively unknown is good for now, he doesn't need glory now all he needs is perseverance"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,rastogishubham,45,Fri Jul 17 01:36:18 2015 UTC,Holy shit!? Did Deku just copy Gran Torino's move?
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,bobrath,65,Thu Jul 16 16:49:22 2015 UTC,Deku has sharingan confirmed.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,_AI_,4,Thu Jul 16 17:35:04 2015 UTC,Called it: https://www.reddit.com/r/BokuNoHeroAcademia/comments/3bxxt5/future_use_theory_of_one_for_all/csqsp39?context=3  He's just gonna be copying people's powers one after another. I didn't expect him to pick one up so quickly and easily though (Gran Torino).
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,Daneruu,16,Fri Jul 17 05:57:37 2015 UTC,"Right now he didn't copy powers as much as he copied a technique. He saw the way Torino moved, and figured with his enhanced muscles he could do the same.   I wouldn't be amazed if he adapts Bakougos mid-air moves by clapping his hands to create shockwaves."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,mandaquila,5,Fri Jul 17 07:25:27 2015 UTC,"True enough. A bit early to make assumptions I suppose.  Although I could see him copying many of the techniques other heroes have with his power, if they are purely physical at least.  Also All-Might can fly, and that hasn't exactly come up as a ""default"" power of OFA.   Also if OFA was a slated ""You get x, y, and z powers now after I transfer this to you"", then I think people would have picked up on it being a passed on thing, rather than the acquisition method still being a secret.  I just really get the feeling that OFA has the potential to manifest differently and mold to each individual owner of the power, and All-Might was just a sub-par user that couldn't move past the basic enhanced physical parameters+flight.  I mean if there was a pattern where this one hero with these exact abilities rose to the top, died/retired, and was almost immediately replaced by another one with the same abilities and potential even though they weren't related by blood, then the general public would pick up on that. If those powers were different with each successive user, then it's just a new #1 for the new generation, nothing really too out of the ordinary.  At the very least there would be a legend/rumor about it."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,Daneruu,10,Fri Jul 17 07:42:35 2015 UTC,"all might didn´t fly, all might simply jumped really high.. that´s why he had to use a smash in order to land"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,ItsLoudB,2,Fri Jul 17 09:00:57 2015 UTC,"One thing that was said as well, is that most of the previous All Mights had powers of their own. They received OFA on top of their own powers."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,mandaquila,6,Fri Jul 17 08:13:57 2015 UTC,this was never stated

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,ItsLoudB,2,Fri Jul 17 12:15:47 2015 UTC,That wasn't the point I was trying to make.  I meant to say that OFA is added to the quirk of the recipient.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,mandaquila,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:11:22 2015 UTC,"Altough we still don´t have enough information on that we can assume that a lot of simmilar quirks exists and that might be other heroes with super strength like All Might. Its just that he is extraordinary even in the field of super strength.   Also, I don´t think that when one passes OFA the other rises immediately. You can see that Deku still has a long way to reach All Might.  One last thing, I don´t think All Might can fly, he only jumps really high and far like the Hulk."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,_Looes_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:54:48 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of how Sena of Eyeshield 21 evolved during the series. He learnt a lot from other players moves and gave his own twist.  Also, natural copycat characters tend to become really OP, specially MCs.  I know that a copycat quirk exists and its no the case for Deku, is more like learning through experience and observation. And copying/adapting  techniques instead of coming with something entirely different."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,PakiIronman,5,Thu Jul 16 23:05:04 2015 UTC,I don't remember Izuku changing directions in mid air during that arc
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,Rin-S,2,Thu Jul 16 23:21:10 2015 UTC,coughs  He can easily use the momentum to his advantage and change directions.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,PakiIronman,12,Thu Jul 16 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"That's just him jumping to all might, he didn't change direction mid jump or anything. He jumped in a straight line."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,Rin-S,-6,Thu Jul 16 23:54:47 2015 UTC,He can easily use the momentum to his advantage and change directions.

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,CJL13,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:05:18 2015 UTC,I wonder if Stain will even try to kill him.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,RoseBladePhantom,11,Thu Jul 16 18:42:27 2015 UTC,Tenya or the other victim... Deku... meh.  I'm curious is Deku is going to mess up Stain's flow of combat.  Deku:  Asks why are you attacking heroes Stain:  Explains himself Deku:  Listens and asks questions about what he says to try and understand. Stain:  Gets weirded out since Deku isn't going I'm a hero you're a villain time to wreak you and trying to figure out his point of view and might agree with him on some points.    Stain finding out about someone getting Handsie with the public and is throwing a fit with Noumu's has him leaving the three and going to kill them would I think throw off Deku's game.  Kill what he considers fakes he still has his own code.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,RemnantX,40,Thu Jul 16 20:35:33 2015 UTC,"Okay, I'm calling it. In the next chapter Izuku is going to selflessly save both Ida and that hero. He leaves a giant opening but Stain decides to spare him. Because he put his life above others and that's what a hero should do, not looking for revenge under the guise of heroism.   Remember when All might said that the hero name has become somewhat distorted? That people see it as a job rather than a responsibility. Heck even Idas placement hero even said that heroes are no better than the police or any other kind of law enforcement. Which doesn't make sense, because that means they are always holding back and someone like Stain will take advantage of that.  Stain shares some similar views but his are very toxic however they have shown to work. The true toxic thing is that Stain is right, heroes are too self absorbed and need a wake up call. The trouble is he just had a run in with Japans equivalent of Captain America."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,heymomimonreddit,2,Fri Jul 17 07:45:41 2015 UTC,"Hero mentor for Tenya I think touched on something important, Heroes are backup for when law enforcement can't handle the situation, they aren't authorized to hunt down whoever they see fight, detain or kill them.  Heroes aren't Judge Dread.  I do agree Stain theory is right but his practice and actions don't fix the problem just slow down the current heroes doing what he doesn't like."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,vicwood,28,Thu Jul 16 20:39:17 2015 UTC,"I kinda hope Stain doesn't get killed off. I'm liking how he's a more Lex Luthor style villain in his ideals/philosophy while Shigaraki is the foil for Deku/token ""screw the world"" villain.  And it's looking a lot like Deku's studying is making him more of an adapt other's moves type fighter which could be pretty cool."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,ItsLoudB,27,Thu Jul 16 17:01:53 2015 UTC,Stain's in a tough spot. He's the type of villain that usually gets trotted out MUCH later in the story to challenge the hero's sense of purpose.  I hope he lives through this arc and gets to continue doing his thing..
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,bad_joke_maker,23,Thu Jul 16 17:11:30 2015 UTC,I'd love him to see him play a role to Deku like The Joker is to Batman.   A role where he's still a dangerous villian to society but his main purpose is to test Deku's purity and values as a hero.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,Glitter_puke,8,Thu Jul 16 17:45:33 2015 UTC,If there's any talk Deku might not see him totally as a bad person.  Stain wants there to only be actual heroes in the world not people monopolizing on the profession... Granted he'll kill the fake and acknowledge the true heroes... then kill them.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,continuityOfficer,5,Thu Jul 16 20:42:28 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it's gonna be around Stain trying to break Deku's mentality of the perfect hero, trying to show him the world is flawed BUT THEN OUT OF NOWHERE NARUTO APPEARS AND TALKNOJUTSU OUT OF EVERYONE AND RASENGANS START FLYING"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,RemnantX,3,Thu Jul 16 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"to be honest, to me it looks the exact opposite of that.. stain has probably an higher consideration of the role of the hero"
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,Duffya,26,Fri Jul 17 09:06:11 2015 UTC,Stain should become a teacher at Yuei. He teaches the core ethics about being a hero so well. Almost all the class dying during his teaching would be a drawback though.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,orangeYouScared,15,Thu Jul 16 17:46:14 2015 UTC,"He defaults to not begrudging kids though. Look at his reaction when Iida first shows up. They're naïve enough that he really can't justify kiling them. Unless, like Iida, they do something so unheroic as yelling that they'll kill someone as revenge.  He'd probably fail Uraraka on ethics. Katsuki might pass, we really haven't seen him be heroic or non-heroic, just extremely competent."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,charlesthechuck,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:10:50 2015 UTC,I think if he was in a teaching position he might be able to understand better about how these kids are nieve. Especially if its in a simulated situation rather then a real one
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,RemnantX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:25:35 2015 UTC,He'd have to deal with the fall out from beating up and killing heroes first before they let him around kids...  I think the long pull now would be in the future if Stain survives Tenya seeking him out for training in combat to defeat a foe that should not be left unchecked and states he hates Stain but is willing to swallow his pride and feelings to get something he needs to do the job.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,McCaffrey210,18,Thu Jul 16 20:46:14 2015 UTC,"Here's something interesting I've noticed:  Superhero comics artists utilize a lot of splash pages/panels of still shots, they look a lot like sports photos in that they are very detailed still shots of action scenes. Like everyone just freeze-framed what they were doing.   Manga artists are a lot about motion. Art feels kinetic and intense, and conveys feelings of motion like you're watching all of the movements in one panel.  Horikoshi does a lot of both. You can find a lot of examples of traditional manga style with the fight between Iida and Stain, but there are some examples of western style in the fight between the Noumu and the heroes in the upper-right panel of pg9 and the punch panel on the last page. I like spotting influences like this."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,HighFiveMinato,6,Fri Jul 17 02:49:50 2015 UTC,"Interesting observation! I agree with /u/charlesthechuck in that a post would be better for this, we can get a better discussion that way."

After them, the ""i help this way because  i had a bad day and this the best way i can think of helping"" died and then came The ""i am the night, i am vengance"" bulshit  Right now, crime in gotham is personal and his victories against ""incredible odds"" (those being superman and darkseid), are or by bullshit im-always-prepared-for-things-i-really-cant-predict reasons or by pure deus ex machina because DC looooves to suck on batman's monetary dick.   There is a reason for which i said ""Hero-Killer uses superman printed undies"". For the eyes of someone looking for an uniteresed idol superman is the way to go. No death parents (well, his dad is dead but that was a heart attack), no vengance, no money. Violence is always the last resort, always ""save the civilian first"". He does what he does because is the right thing to do.  And, boy (or girl, i really don't know), haven't you been paying atention?

Even scarier is we don't know if he made these quickly after noumu prime, or if NP was the first to mature of the batch  Stain just spoke some truth to iida. Which did have me shivering, but he looks like a ninja turtle in some panels. Also it seems licking/ingesting the victim's blood paralyzes them.  Deku is moving like Gran Torino. First step to hulk jump over great distances maybe.   I wonder how scaled these noumus are to the first seeing as endeavor is facing them. Maybe they have a weakness. Maybe they have different quirk sets. Anywho i am beyond hyped."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,ExceedMaster,5,Thu Jul 16 21:36:36 2015 UTC,"Amazing chapter. We see that Iida's motivation is not revenge. In all of all that hatred that he has for Stain, there is a strong love for the heroism that his heroism that his brother has done, and more importantly, for his brother. It is not just selfishness; it is the strength of human connection that has been misguided. Stain calls it selfishness but has not realized that he is causing the corruption that is trying to fight. This chapter is a somewhat a turn around from his previous feelings. Before, we saw that his feelings were born from revenge and hatred. But his spouting of his brother being a symbol, what does it mean? Iida's progression is not set in stone. I am very excited.  We also see a strong point of Deku. His entire life he has been looking up to heroes and worrying about them, and he still is. We see the difference between him and Iida/many other heroes. He is immune to such corruption. He has priorities, but they are born from the desire to protect, and it has shown splendidly.  We see the limits of Gran Torino. The show of Endeavor is amazing. I wonder if there will be a connection between him and Midoriya. I don't say Deku as I think that this connection will be very different from him and All Might. It might harden his heart like it did for Todoriko.  Stain might have a growing admiration for Midoriya. He definitely saw him coming. Whether he let Midoriya hit him or just couldn't dodge it, that is the next chapter to decide. Stain and Midoriya's relationship will certainly be a guiding factor. Maybe Midoriya will see that heroes are all not what they see to be. Maybe it will see him see the evil in Bakugou.  Given this serie's unorthodox progression, this chapter opens many possibilities. One thing is certain: Midoriya will not falter from his behavior we have seen from the first chapter. He is a hero to the core."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,the_flame_alchemist,4,Fri Jul 17 03:58:55 2015 UTC,"sorry bro, but iida´s motivation is totally revenge..."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,RemnantX,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:08:53 2015 UTC,"I think it was revenge based personally and Tenya being a bit naïve.    Stain has more battle experience and after seeing Tenya he told him to stand down or get put down.    He could tell Tenya might be fast but he is blinded by his want for revenge to do to Stain what Stain did to his brother, end his career as a villain not bring him in.  Stain didn't even remember the brother I don't think and he probably doesn't care who it was.  Stain doesn't think he's wrong.  Tenya is usually a standup by the book guy, he's off the reservation of his normal way of thinking due to what happened to his brother who he thought was a stellar example of what a hero is.  If it comes down to a fistfight on ideology wining the fight doesn't mean winning the argument.  It means you're better at fighting.    I would say the ultimate taunt would be Stain flipping the logic on Tenya, you're idol fake hero brother was taken down by me... are you saying you want to take me down to prove you're better than your idol?  If you do does that mean your idol was false and weak?  Tenya can't move so listening to him talk bad about his brother would probably get a angered shut up but if he starts that line of thinking he might snap.  What was he thinking?  He should be able to tell if he's brother in all matters is better at doing this plus has experience what was he hoping to accomplish?  Die defending his brother's loss?  Would his brother want that?  Would it just break his older brother's heart that much more showing his was even more powerless?  Stain and Deku I agree will be interesting since Deku isn't an instinct, don't think combat monkey, he constantly thinks but Stain may see him as also naïve or a curiousity to watch/stalk?   Deku has been a hero fanboy a long time, doing it for money, fame, cus it's the right thing to do for their motivation didn't matter that much to him before.  They were helping people versus hurting people with their quirk and to him they looked cool.  Now he might have a different view.  Even if they're doing it for the 'wrong' or 'not right' reason they're doing good.  That's enough for Deku for now to defend their way of being a hero because hero's need to do good things and help people, as long as they're doing that the motivations are just semantics.    Gran Torino is what late 50s/early 60s maybe older?  Endeavor seeing a connection between Deku, All Might, and Gran Torino will probably not be noticed since like Katsuki he's only focused on certain things and doesn't usually notice small things he doesn't care about.  That isn't to mean either one isn't perceptive... they might notice something and just not care."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,The_ThirdFang,2,Mon Jul 20 16:42:14 2015 UTC,Stain's ability is like a mild version of Hidan's although there are clear advantages to his too
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,RemnantX,2,Fri Jul 17 00:08:14 2015 UTC,"So I just watched a ChibiReview of this chapter(YouTube) and here are my thoughts on this chapter combined with the review.  Stain wants to kill heroes who don't have the motive of actually helping people. For example, Endeavor who just wants to surpass All Might. Also Uraraka who wants to use her powers to gain money. Iida who is on the path of vengeance. And I believe Bakugou also wants to be the Number 1 hero.   Basically Stain despises the fake heroes. Those who become ""heroes"" just for their own gains. Either money or popularity.(Or Both)   As Stain says his speech we see Deku fly in and punch him. Which was a perfect moment. Stain basically tells Iida the reasoning of why he is killing heroes. But then the one who contradicts his reasoning pops up.   Deku is a true hero. He puts aside his own wants for others. He is the one actually saving people for the sake of saving people. This is why I want say inb4 that in the end of the manga which I hope will be 15 years from now. Deku will surpass All Might and also become the Number 1 hero because he is the one true hero. He doesn't do it for the fame, for the money, for the ladies. He does it because he da realist hero around.  Also saw a comment in the ChibiReview video that said. Heroes aren't born they are made. Which Deku wasn't born with powers. He was given those powers. He was made into a super powered person. He started from the bottom. Now he's here.  TL;DR Deku is a true hero and most of his classmates and other heroes do it for profit and that's why Stain wants to kill heroes."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,DonomerDoric,2,Fri Jul 17 04:29:09 2015 UTC,So does Stain have to ingest the blood of whomever he's fighting in order to paralyze them?
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,eceuiuc,7,Thu Jul 16 19:42:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's possible.  The wild theory I'm going with is he has sanguinary clairvoyance, the ability to taste someone's true worth and inner thoughts through their blood.  Since Stain talks but doesn't really taunt as much as chastise heroes I figure people lock up due to his power and what he's saying about them.  Much like a snake fixes his prey in place in front of him for an easy meal.  I think Stain disables his prey for an easy kill as well."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,RemnantX,3,Thu Jul 16 20:58:58 2015 UTC,That sounds terrifying

It does make me interested in what exactly they are.  They're supposedly brain dead, and yet they'll mindlessly attack people on their own?  The fact that the brain is exposed has to have something to do with it."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,HokageEzio,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:37:43 2015 UTC,I think this brings up the point someone was creating Noumus and they're strong but no All Might Destroyer level strong.  The fact he gave up half but kept the others though means he could possibly enhance the ones he kept even more than what we're seeing.    I am curious why no one punches or shocks their exposed brain.  Besides it probably being rude.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,alasth0r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:54:14 2015 UTC,After reading this chapter I figure stain has insane reflexes.  1.noticing Iida right away 2.pulling back when tomura was about to attack 3.noticing ofa deku(his presence) 4.noticing blackmist before he almost shows up.  Since his quirk is so close combat like its no wonder he relys on instinct.....i like his watch too  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqvb,Anzelatron,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:09:33 2015 UTC,I think his awareness is like Katsuki's relying on an almost predatory animal sense of awareness in combat so he has more time to think about tactics.  Although he felt Deku he didn't expect Deku to be that quick so he couldn't dodge/counter.

My money is that Stain see's that Midoriya is a real hero and decides to spare his life and possible the other two ( wishful thinking) once the battle of the Nomou's heats up or possible interferes with their fight. Don't know if it's bad for me to think this, but I'm sort of hoping, since Endeavor magically popped up in Hosu during this, that Stain may try and go after him."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3diqrz,amonali,3,Thu Jul 16 22:57:52 2015 UTC,Probably. Your theory makes sense.

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3deqmk,ArosHD,17,Wed Jul 15 19:10:38 2015 UTC,Somehow this reminded me of Aokiji vs Akainu fight scene in PunkHazard

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3deqmk,Brook420,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:21:21 2015 UTC,Hopefully itll be shown in a flashback in the next arc.
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3deqmk,NonchalantNinja,3,Fri Jul 17 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"Probably won't be shown until we learn what Aokiji is really up to. Either way, it's one of the fights I'm most excited for in the future right behind Enel and Luffy's inevitable rematch."
BokuNoHeroAcademia,3deqmk,Brook420,7,Sat Jul 18 03:23:05 2015 UTC,He's azhor ahai!

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3deqmk,Lufti94,2,Thu Jul 16 12:01:04 2015 UTC,"Madhouse is doing One Punch Man really soon and if they do good with that then I would probably want them to do this one. If not, I think studio mappa would do good too."

BokuNoHeroAcademia,3ddsb9,PakiIronman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:10:50 2015 UTC,I should make mine quote an OC too...
