WikiInAction,3e21tf,StukaLied,18,Tue Jul 21 10:25:58 2015 UTC,"We're swiftly approaching the six month marker for the Gamergate ArbCom final decision. Ryulong has spent almost every single day since obsessively editing about Gamergate over at RationalWiki, pissing off all kinds of people including the other patients in the RW loony bin.  It's been a while since I checked up on crazy town, so I put on my lab coat and headed over.  On July 2nd, our cantankerous mental patient Dragondragon told an IP editor to stop drinking the Kool-Aid. A few days before this, he Listen and Believed Randi Harper's caterwauling claims that Milo was going to ""dox her children."" (A quick glance at his charts showed copious amounts of Kool-Aid being consumed, but we all kinda figured that.)  As Dragondragon argued with an IP, Dragondragon accused him of ""gas lighting"" and raged that the red pill is garbage. This does not bode well for the patient, as rejection of the red pill confirms he is living in ignorance.  As Dragondragon continued to delusionally white knight for Randi (who must be the complete opposite kind of person in Ryulong's blue pilled world), some of the other patients began to hoot and holler and a nasty nutter called Castaigne ripped his hair out and jumped on the tables because another patient, Jeeves, had been concerned about Ryulong's Gamergate obsession. The nutter screamed that worrying for Ryulong's mental health was just ""gas lighting"" before leaving for his shock therapy appointment.  Another patient read a Breitbart article and had to be rushed into therapy before his worldview crumbled.  One patient asked Dragondragon to watch a video but Dragondragon would have nothing of it, saying he had never watched it and never would but he knew it was all ""fucking untrue."" This was quite depressing as Dragondragon and another patient spent July 4th arguing about harassment, with DragonDragon white knighting Zoe Quinn to boot. Most Americans would celebrate Independence Day with barbeques, family get togethers, and/or watching fireworks. Not Ryulong.   Everything int he video is fucking untrue. Everything IA said in August was based on bullshit only Gamergaters believed. Listen to yourself. You're demanding that we watch some fucking 20 minute long video on when this shit was still being called ""The Quinnspiracy"". It's July 2015 Burkean. Even Gamergate's moved on from that. We don't have to address anything in the video because the video isn't worth watching. We have known this since IA first posted it last year. How fucking stupid do you take us for?—Ryūlóng (琉竜) 23:53, 2 July 2015 (UTC)    This bickering went on for days, and Dragondragon eventually threw a chair across the room and howled about a visitor mocking him about Condol Legs/Buddyloids, while ranting that his name ""is on all these fuckers' walled gardens."" During this endless back-and-forth, other inmates began to join in and the nutter Castaigne got triggered by a South Park quote.  It appeared that Dragondragon had stolen some tin foil from the kitchen, as he proclaimed that if you agree at all with Gamergate then you should be dehumanized as a ""Gamergater"" and that the movement attracts neo-Nazis, conservatives, MRAs, and libertarians. Goodness! The patient still doesn't believe there are people that are ""anti-Gamergate"" despite he himself posting to such groups.  The asylum got a new patient, Dandtiks69, in June, which, like Ryulong, was committed by Wikipedia. This patient clearly suffers from dissociative identity disorder. Dandtiks69 joined the other patients in arguing about Gamergate, where he stated his beliefs that all ""hard-core gamers"" are high school/college drop outs or have never gone to school.  Dandtiks69 quickly cozied up to Ryulong and tried to portray himself as a brother in arms for being banned from Wikipedia. Dragondragon ignored them as Dandtiks69 and some other patients jabbered away in Dragondragon's room, where a patient wanted to know why Dandtiks69 hadn't tried sock puppetry and Dandtiks69 confessed he was planning on socking on Wikipedia:   Why don't you use a socket puppet account?--Arisboch (talk) 18:32, 20 July 2015 (UTC)  I was planning on doing that, but like I said administrators are willing to label anyone who helps me a sockpuppet. Dandtiks69 (talk) 18:33, 20 July 2015 (UTC).   Can't they also tell my IP? Basically I would need to do that but somehow convince people that I am reputable.Dandtiks69 (talk) 18:34, 20 July 2015 (UTC)    Sometime after engaging in some extremely childish name calling, Dragondragon snuck into his room and tightly wound his stolen tin foil around his head before returning to proclaim that the ""core Gamergaters"" pass around A. Wyatt Mann artwork to ""scare the weak willed masses"" and that they believe Jews control the world. The patient believes the rest of the Gamergate movement is comprised of ""NotYourShield shields"". This conversation then went even more insane as the Dragondragon started trying to defend radical Islam and other patients got riled up. One began grasping at imaginary straws to connect Gamergate to white supremacists. (Uh oh, think how many things Gamergate is connected to since KotakuInAction is on reddit!)  One of Dandtik69's other personalities must have made these unsigned remarks praising the Wikipedia Gamergate controversy article's neutrality. Dandtiks69 then began to wonder how to get their asylum to appear further up on Google searches.   Considering the important issues like the one we have right now with Gamergate, politics, and stupidity in general, how do we get ourselves to become more popular, or mainstream (for example, how do we get ourselves higher up into the Google search page?)? If we are to become more active and keep ourselves going, and to spread our original research, we must get popular. Dandtiks69 (talk) 05:08, 9 July 2015 (UTC)  What the fuck are you going on about?—Ryūlóng (琉竜) 05:52, 9 July 2015 (UTC)    Dragondragon eventually rewrote the lede to coincide with his delusions:    I rewrote the lead to focus more on how Gamergate is about the /pol/ mindset rather than specifically about the issue of gender in gaming. The issue is there, but as we learned from our ""friends"" who have been frequenting here, it's not really about gender. It's about SJWs by which I mean it's about reactionaries and conservatives. When I do rewrite something, someone always complains about it, so use this bit down here to raise concerns or just do copyediting as you see fit.—Ryūlóng (琉竜) 07:00, 9 July 2015 (UTC)    Yesterday, Dandtiks69 ran down the halls in his straight jacket and giggled maniacally as he searched for Ryulong. Apparently Gamergate is dead because there was nothing going on at the ever-so-important RationalWiki Gamergate article Talk page!   I guess its true, Ryulong, nothing new is happening here. Gamergate is finally dying its ass off. Dandtiks69 (talk) 22:37, 20 July 2015 (UTC)    As my visit ended, I took one last glance towards Dragondragon, who was sitting in the activities room. Some patients preferred finger paints, others just stared at the table, but Dragondragon was working on his ""List of monsters"", an otiose project the doctors of the asylum let him carry over from Wikipedia.  All in all, a hilariously sad visit."

No, that's deliberately making someone doubt their own sanity by screwing with their perceptions. It's based on the film Gaslight, and used as a term for abuse, which SJWs naturally appropriated, misunderstood the definition of, and proceeded to use to cry wolf at the drop of a hat.   One patient asked Dragondragon to watch a video but Dragondragon would have nothing of it, saying he had never watched it and never would but he knew it was all ""fucking untrue.""    Don't Listen and Disbelieve?   It appeared that Dragondragon had stolen some tin foil from the kitchen, as he proclaimed that if you agree at all with Gamergate then you should be dehumanized as a ""Gamergater"" and that the movement attracts neo-Nazis, conservatives, MRAs, and libertarians.   What, no PUAs and Redpillers? Gotta go for the full misogynist manosphere set.   The patient believes the rest of the Gamergate movement is comprised of ""NotYourShield shields"".   No evidence provided, of course.   but Dragondragon was working on his ""List of monsters"",   ""I have here in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Internets as being members of the Gamergate Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy on Wikipedia."""

Unfortunately without back up, Masem alone stands against them:   As ""Terrorism"" is a word with extreme legal connotations, we must avoid using it except as a claim, though certainly stating that some equate the harassment and threats made under the hashtag as acts of terrorism with appropriate prose and citation can be added. And arguably while that article uses GG as the prime example of online harassment towards females, this article is the wrong place to be discussing the larger issues overall (that would be likely over at Cyberharassment in lieu of any other article about online gender harassment). --MASEM (t) 14:14, 15 July 2015 (UTC)  Terrorism is a word like any other, and we'll use it if the reliable sources use it. MarkBernstein (talk) 02:36, 17 July 2015 (UTC)  As long as we attribute it to them as an opinion and not fact as per WP:W2W, that's fine (I in fact even included the vice piece where we had a second piece on GG being akin to terrorism). But we absolutely cannot label it ""terrorism"" as a fact since that has strong legal implications; it is not just a word as you claim. --MASEM (t) 03:06, 17 July 2015 (UTC)  It's a word, and if reliable sources can use it so can we. We wouldn't be making any claims ourselves- merely echoing mainstream consensus. PeterTheFourth (talk) 04:13, 17 July 2015 (UTC)  I agree that we shouldn't apply special tests to particular words. If our best sources are agreed on using a particular word, that's the word we should use in Wikipedia's voice. --TonySidaway 11:09, 17 July 2015 (UTC)  We absolutely have to watch for words that have contentious meanings behind them to avoid stating a contentious POV in WP's voice, that's the whole point of WP:LABEL and WP:NPOV. Calling what GG is doing as ""terrorism"" in WP's voice without attribution, simply because a few sources compared GG's activities to terrorism, is taking a non-partial tone and cannot be done. Similar situation is with this edit [4] about the dehumanization of the victims; we don't know 100% if dehumanization is the intent of GG when they use the ""Literally who"" titles, though clearly we have opinions that state this is the intent which are important to include, just not stated in WP's voice. This is a social situation with too many questions due to lack of information from one side that no one knows the absolute facts, so to present some of these POVs as facts is a violation of NPOV. We can say absolutes on the actions of GG, but we can't state that on the intents or motives. --MASEM (t) 13:59, 17 July 2015 (UTC)  No. If the reliable sources say that Hydrogen is an element, we say it is an element, not that it is claimed to be an element. If the reliable sources say that American Civil War concerned slavery, we say it concerned slavery. If the reliable sources say that Gamergate engages in terrorism, we will say so, too. If the reliable sources were to agree that Gamergate's motives were the promotion of chocolate cake, then we'd agree that Gamergate promotes chocolate cake. We do not disregard the consensus of reliable sources because we personally believe something they do not regarding Gamergate's motivations, however strongly we think we know motivations that have been hidden from the rest of mankind.

A lot goes towards grants, which are put towards editathons, external development, and independent Wikimedia chapters. A lot of this indirectly results in content production. Projects like the Teahouse and upcoming Co-op, both of which help introduce new editors and help with editor retention, have been made possible through grants.  Not everything development does is a fail, either. Wikipedia's mobile apps, for example, have been largely successful and account for a huge and growing readership.

Knowing the truth from the future he had visited, the DisuseKid also made sure to gut the section about conspiracy theories.

InedibleHulk (talk) 01:53, July 7, 2015 (UTC)   After a discussion over Hulk's use of ""fuck off"", things began to simmer down, but the DisuseKid was crestfallen:   I admit I am just as guilty of being aggressive in this ordeal, but I did expect some sort of response to be taken from all this. DisuseKid (talk) 04:54, 7 July 2015 (UTC)   I think you've gotten a response. Seven editors have written over 1,300 words, you have received an apology, and there's a good chance you'll be forgiven this time for your side of it. The only other available responses are: 1. A warning issued by an admin, which is basically a slap-on-wrist and doesn't mean much in the long run, and 2. a block. A block of even a couple of days is a fairly serious matter for anyone who gives a shit about their record, and I believe the Hulk to be such a person (I could be wrong). Considering that you didn't come here with clean hands, and you soiled them further after you got here, I'd suggest dropping this at this point. If an admin feels a Hulk block is warranted, fine, but it's a good time for you to step away. ―Mandruss ☎ 05:13, 7 July 2015 (UTC)    At this time, the ANI discussion is moving towards closing with no action due to both parties apologizing and acknowledging they fucked up.  A long discussion is going at BLPN about the murder-not murder issue that caused this, where the DisuseKid got more chilling doses of Wikipedia reality:    But Wikipedia's an encyclopedia. Shouldn't it be accurate, first and foremost? DisuseKid (talk) 02:09, 7 July 2015 (UTC)  Not exactly. verifiability trumps truth. But if what's verifiable and what's true match up (and they often do), it's a win-win. Before a killing becomes a murder, it needs to go through the courts, to make sure it wasn't justifiable or excusable. Then a reliable source picks up the verdict, and we reflect it. InedibleHulk (talk) 02:39, July 7, 2015 (UTC)  Whatever. I wish to wait till a consensus is made before we take care of the editing process. DisuseKid (talk) 02:46, 7 July 2015 (UTC)"
WikiInAction,3cctv6,StukaLied,13,Mon Jul 6 22:30:39 2015 UTC,"At first this WikiHounding SPA tried to unarchive the AE request against DHeyward (which has been sitting there doing nothing for days)  Smug that one of those damn ""sea lions"" hadn't escaped under the radar, he then went to go edit the precious Gamergate controversy article and make sure the rhetoric was more emotionally driven, then was potentially canvassed by one of the anti-GG subreddits he frequents and voted Delete in an AFD against the Mike Cernovich article (a lawyer involved with Gamergate, nominated for deletion by Jorm after he and others gutted the article by saying the sources aren't reliable)  About an hour later, MONGO saw what the SPA had done at AE and reverted it. The SPA told him the bot had ""made a mistake"", and MONGO told him to go complain about the bot in the proper venue then.  With his snout smacked by a rolled up newspaper, the WikiHound then dragged himself to Arb Requests Talk to cry about this 'mistake' the bot had made, while trying to get MONGO in trouble of course, and MONGO explained how the bot works and eventually suggested an interaction ban between the Hound and DHeyward would not be a bad idea.  They were also at MONGO's talk where the WikiHound once more claimed the bot 'made a mistake', and MONGO tried to get the Hound to agree to an interaction ban, to which the Hound snarled, ""I'd hoped to discuss this civilly. Oh well.""  The WikiHound then went to Gamaliel's Talk with a shaggy dog story about how he was just trying to unarchive the request like a good little doggy, and, with tears in his eyes, began to whine about how mean old MONGO appeared to talk shit about him being an SPA and edit warred and shows a ""willingness to continue edit warring to remove this request"".   ""How should I solve this issue with MONGO's conduct?"" the WikiHound asked.  MONGO told him if he didn't want to be called an SPA maybe he should take that out of his signature and actually contribute to the project outside of Gamergate crap and stalking DHeyward.  Even Johnuniq and Liz agreed that the WikiHound probably shouldn't have been unarchiving it.   @PTF: Please drop it, and please stop acting as a clerk at WP:AE. Adopting a pragmatic approach at Wikipedia is best—the discussion concerning the case you are trying to re-open does not show any likelihood of an outcome you might want, and everyone is sick of gamergate, so fighting the archive bot is unlikely to help you. Bickering over this topic will lead to sanctions regardless of merit. Johnuniq (talk) 11:38, 6 July 2015 (UTC)  Thats pretty much my thinking but I am suggesting Gamaliel make a final decision as to whether this things stays archived or he can reopen it for further review.--MONGO 11:42, 6 July 2015 (UTC)  I agree. It's not unusual for an AE case to be retrieved from the archives in order to close but looking at the past three months, when it has been retrieved, it's been the action of an administrator who could act on the complaint. Liz Read! Talk! 11:48, 6 July 2015 (UTC)   Finally, Gamaliel came in and gave his two cents:   @PeterTheFourth: You should step back from this matter and be drastically less involved in the affairs of Dheyward from now on. @MONGO: I understand why you reverted him, but maybe next time you should let someone less connected to Dheyward do it instead?  I've already said that I was not going to impose a sanction in this matter, and if no other administrator is inclined to impose one, then I think this matter should just disappear into the archives. I hope that Dheyward is honoring his stated intention to stay away from these articles for a short time. For all the grousing about how allegedly unsanctioned certain Chief Scientists have been regarding Gamergate, Dheyward has received a remarkable number of warnings about these articles yet has avoided serious, long-term sanction. I will keep that in mind if he ends up back at WP:AE again. Regarding PeterTheFourth, while this may be a case of Wikihounding, I'm going to WP:AGF here. I'm certainly not going to impose an interaction ban or sanction on him for this without imposing one on Dheyward as well. Gamaliel (talk) 19:11, 6 July 2015 (UTC)"
WikiInAction,3cctv6,AlseidesDD,11,Mon Jul 6 23:06:45 2015 UTC,Really? They're going after Cernovich's article?  And an SPA who UNARCHIVES a fucking AE complaint doesn't even fucking get a warning while people keep giving Dheyward and Mongo the stink eye for daring to adhere to policy and behave in a way that doesn't incriminate themselves?  What the fuck?
WikiInAction,3cctv6,Der_Process,12,Tue Jul 7 01:09:44 2015 UTC,"I just took a closer look, Salvidrim! actually protected the article due to fears of canvasing from the anti-GG faction on reddit, then Jorm came in and started gutting it and AFD'd it once there was little left."
