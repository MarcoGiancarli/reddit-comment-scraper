fantanoforever,3e0hag,Urgotobekidding,8,Tue Jul 21 00:33:29 2015 UTC,"No worries about the wall of text. When I first started watching TND I mainly stuck to watching videos about familiar genres such as hip-hop. I'd usually watch his review after listening to the album to see how our opinions lined up. While I still do that, I usually watch all of his videos now to get good music recommendations. I'd recommend watching his videos first and then listening to the album if you want to get a feel of what to expect. Then again, sometimes it's a lot more fun to go in knowing nothing at all!"
fantanoforever,3e0hag,THING2000,2,Tue Jul 21 01:19:23 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot man.
fantanoforever,3e0hag,Poerflip23,4,Tue Jul 21 09:54:22 2015 UTC,"Theneedledrop isn't really a show that you need to watch from the first video and on. Seeing various reviews from different time periods will however help you to understand a lot of his opinions and preferences that may be relevant in the future and a lot of the jokes that are often thrown into his videos.   I've been watching TND for about 3 years. When I first started I only watched the videos of artists or albums that I knew and liked. Over time I started watching by genre that I like in order to find new music but as my love for the #basedfantano grew, I have been watching everything he posts just because I like to hear him talk and his opinions and thoughts. It also opens you to music I've never heard before!  He does review a lot of obscure and underground music, so when it's a review of something I wasn't already listening to or enjoying I don't listen to it before I see the review. And a lot of the time I don't listen to it afterwards unless it sounded very intriguing or he just loved it.   Also as he has stated hundreds of times ""it's just my opinion"", I think he has very good opinions that are widely shared and respectable. Here lately I've been seeing a lot more disagreements (probably because TPAB and The Powers That B spoiled him hahaha) about scores and stuff. If he really enjoys something I have a feeling that I will too just because we have similar tastes and preferences. If he hates it I might too. I don't base my thoughts on what he says but rather compare them and look on both sides. If I really like something he hates or vice versa then I don't let it bother me.   The videos can be long, but they are usually very thorough. Once you become a seasoned viewer you'll barely notice the times, except when they are really short, because you just enjoy hearing what he has to say. If you are short on time I'd suggest his other channel, thatistheplan, where he has been posting lots of shorter reviews lately!   Hope this helps!"
fantanoforever,3e0hag,Poerflip23,2,Tue Jul 21 04:19:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response. Now, about the joke videos, is there a some kind of playlist for them or will I have to search on my own? Could you possibly help me with that?"

Start watching the new videos for anything that sounds interesting, or just all of them. You can glean a lot of music recommendations from just a couple videos usually.

fantanoforever,3ascly,MegaBassMan12,6,Tue Jun 23 03:00:54 2015 UTC,"A serious question to you folks below. If you're here you probably love music like I do. I feel like I'm in a pickle with this because of the amount that's readily available to digest. Between the popular albums that everybody likes, the albums in those weird genres (vaporwave, dream pop, shoegaze, etc) that get me off, the just plain weird stuff you get recommended by friends, and the stuff I end up trying to digest from eras past (free jazz, city pop, etc), it seems like there's just too much music available nowadays. The crazy thing is that it's only getting worse by the month.   How many of you buy every album you listen to? It seems unsustainable to me. Sure I buy the ones that 'stick' and I try to make it to almost every show around me that I would enjoy, but at a point I can't help but want to test drive an album.   Today I didn't work and listened to four different albums. I will admit that I did not even stream them. Did I do a disservice to musicians? If I did, will I ever feel like I can blow $40+ like that on a good day of listening to music? Probably not. It seems there's no ~correct way~ for an average person who is passionate about music to digest it all without streaming it or pirating it. Do you all have rules with yourself that if you listen to it a certain number of times or something you buy it? Am I wrong in my feeling that there's just too much? What about those albums you can't find to stream, or heck even to buy? Do you skip on buying an album simply because you assume an artist is well off (ie Kendrick Lamar vs Car Sear Headrest)?"
fantanoforever,3ascly,benji1the1dog,3,Tue Jun 23 07:16:42 2015 UTC,"As always (x)thony's thoughts are totally justified and make complete sense, but what gets me is his delivery sometimes. The value of music vid's comments did have a fair amount of people saying that they value music even if they don't monetarily pay for it, and the way people say it is a bit naive sometimes, but Anthony didn't need to make it sound like these people are people who pretend like money doesn't exist. I like to think TND is at a point where nuances like representing others opinions as friendly and reasonable as possible matters, and he didn't do that here. I'm not going to say it affects my opinion of his stuff, but if he wants to take it to the next level quality wise he's just gotta keep that shit in mind, even in is thisistheplan shit"
fantanoforever,3ascly,drrocket8775,3,Tue Jun 23 05:03:32 2015 UTC,"But isn't the point of the thisistheplan channel to be a tad more blunt? Obviously Anthony is a bit more real on it. I think he keeps it very obviously separated with the way the talks, the lack of editing, and the all in one go approach most videos follow. Sure it's still Anthony Fantano: the internets busiest music nerd, but it certainly doesn't reach the same audience or come off in the same way.   I think the point of it is that he can make these blunt statements. By having this channel he is showing us that he'd rather be real and make it to the top than just be TND and make it to the top."

I'm here to have serious musical discussions about out shared love for music and Anthony Fantano's reviews thereof and what do I get? Seven upvotes and no fucking replys! You know, I have 49 children to feed, and now I have to divide seven karma between all forty-nine of them. 42 of my kids aren't getting any karma tonight, thanks to you guys. One of you could have upvoted, one of you could have replied, facilitated discussion, gotten me more karma. But no! Instead of respecting or remembering Cal you ignore my comment and you hopen to placate me with seven fucking karma? I think not motherfuckers. I am a humble father of forty-nine, and this is the thanks I get? IMPUDENT, IMPISH, AND DISRESPECTFUL!!! I have had it up to here with your circlejerking complacency. /r/askreddit, I make a comment, I get 200 upvotes, my kids eat for 4.0816326531 days. Here I post a comment and six sevenths of my children go without tonight. Do you know how humiliating that is, to be the breadwinner for the family, to come home and say to my forty-nine kids, ""Hey, Daddy's only got seven karma today, so some of you are going to have to make do tonight.""? It tears me up inside. Not only do most of my kids starve, but I have to choose seven by myself!! I love 48 of my kids equally  (except for Cal, who is my favorite since he is named after Cal Chuchesta) and i have to choose forty-two of them to starve. I AM SO FUCKING DONE WITH THIS SUBREDDIT!!!

fantanoforever,35lfp0,vulcan24,7,Mon May 11 13:46:36 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly surprised he disliked it. Maybe I'm just not well-acquainted enough with the genre to have a great standard of comparison, but I loved it and would have given it a light 8. (Edit: I'm not resolute in that score, and I'm open to persuasion. Who knows, maybe in time I'll end up agreeing with Fantano's criticisms of this album.)  I disagree a lot about the songwriting. In a lot of the music I listen to, melody and composition is a high priority (usually above sound, experimentation, lyrics, etc.) and to me this album was not lacking in the slightest. After a few listens, most of the full-length songs became favorites. Lyrics were nothing great, but they have never really been HK's main concern or selling point.  And I'm doubly surprised that he was turned off by Nai's vocals. Flamboyant and cliché they may be at times (like during the key change in Breathing Underwater), but for the most part they're pretty fucking good.  I also think he put too much emphasis on adventurousness (lack thereof). If you set yourself up to be disappointed by an album on the grounds that it didn't experiment enough or push boundaries (which I too admire and appreciate immensely), more often than not you'll be disappointed. Unoriginal their style may or may not be, but it is IMO more than compensated for by well-written songs and great instrumentation (which is another point of disagreement I have - piano/keyboard, drums, vocals, and to a lesser extent bass were all high quality and creatively contributive performances. Especially keyboard and drums).  This is one of the only reviews of his that I've disagreed with this much. At the least, I'm glad to have decided how much I enjoyed it before watching his review, so as to not be as strongly influenced by it. People who have never heard of the band and see this review, don't outright dismiss them based on this score, I recommend you give them a try and come to your own conclusion."
fantanoforever,35lfp0,leppyts,4,Mon May 11 14:53:54 2015 UTC,"Bit disappointed with the score as an Australian music fan. I thought this was a decent album, shame he didn't like it."

fantanoforever,35lfp0,ZaratustraElJarkor,1 point,Tue May 12 02:35:11 2015 UTC,"Compared to their first album, this is not as interesting. There is a lot of repetition of structures, like Anthony said. They are always trying to sound unpredictible with the many syncopations and changes in metrics, put it gets actually really predictible. You know that they are going to incorporate that to most of the songs. Also, HK overextended Nai Palm's voice. Just too many melodies depend on it. They have 3 choristers, for God sake! Use them! It's like they just followed Nai through all the songs.  I've seen these guys live and they are way better, specially the instrumentals. And this is another weak point of ""Choose Your Weapon"". Instruments don't hve enough protagonism. No interesting solos. Like I said, Nai executes most of the melodies. Also, the amateur production makes the instruments sound like a supporting part for Nai, but with the relative harmonic complexity some tracks have, this should not happen.  There are some songs that just don't seem to lead anywhere. For example ""Fingerprints"" or ""Prince Minikid"". They seem to lack a structure and are overly ethereal.  Overall, I liked waaaay more ""Hawk Tomahawk"". ""Choose Your Weapon"" is awfully long, full of repetitive songs and poor attempts to innovate (yes, ""Atari"" and ""Swamp Thing"", I'm looking at you)."

I can't fault him for adding extra instruments, I figured that was going to happen, but overall it's just got this element of cheese that his other efforts didn't.  He seems to be lacking the earnestness that I've always loved about him."

fantanoforever,34us8f,redfrojoe,1 point,Mon May 4 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"Why is this a question. An artist is an artist because he can make whatever art he wants on his desired platform. If he was expected to do something specific (like address social issues), then is it really art? An artist can address social issues if they want to, and an artist can not address social issues if they want to. That's what being an artist is."
fantanoforever,34us8f,french_toste,1 point,Tue May 5 16:34:25 2015 UTC,"Signs of the time and place you live in invariably seep into what you create. With or without an artist's intent there's a historical susceptibility built-in, which allows a work to be interpreted in the context of whatever it coincides. Some works probably encourage the audience to forget that context for a time, but eventually, in retrospect they'll get placed on that plane. I admire artists that try to command the references that will be ascribed to their art. It's like they're trying to use their celebrity for good. Obviously, it should be done tastefully. For me, if their spectacle overshadows the issue they're addressing that's a problem with the fans as much as the artist."

fantanoforever,341mkn,DislikesUSGovernment,11,Mon Apr 27 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"Anthony said that he was really disappointed that he didn't rap very much on this but also said that he hasn't been paying attention to Yela since Radioactive.   Yela has released a bunch of mixtapes and solo projects which do showcase his rapping ability and deliver those consistent gritty lyrics and rapping style that Anthony is apparently has a fan of. Yela has been doing gritty for years and has grown tired of it and having only listened to Radioactive and then this I can see why Anthony was disappointed, but if he listened to the catalog of stuff Yelawolf has put out since, this drastic change in sound might be a bit more fluid and make more sense."

Now when I say this it doesn't mean I don't music with lyrics and characters I don't agree with, I do, I mean that I like I Love You Honeybear more than I would otherwise because I have gained something from what Father John Misty is telling me and I believe him when he says it.

fantanoforever,338lqb,dreamleaking,-11,Wed Apr 22 17:26:40 2015 UTC,"Fantano knows zero about emo, metalcore, and post-hardcore. Him not liking Circa Survive alone should set off some alarms. I hate DGD but every time he opens his mouth about those genres, I immediately disregard everything he has to say (even if it is very positive). He pretty clearly has no idea who DGD are or what their aesthetic intends to be. Someone in /r/posthardcore pointed out that his review is akin to giving a campy horror movie a low score for not being dark and serious.   Interesting, I don't think he said anything about the guitar, drums, bass, song structure, tone, or anything other than the vocals and lyrics. I'm not positive he actually listened to it at all and instead just gave a critique of what he doesn't like about DGD in general."
fantanoforever,338lqb,MisterB0,11,Tue Apr 21 03:03:46 2015 UTC,"Well, from what I get from Anthony's review, he sees post-hardcore as a more serious genre and already has some pre-defined expectations for what he's looking for from bands that associate themselves with the genre.  Anthony, as do many other people, prefer to idealize the earlier music related to the post-hardcore genre opposed to the newer styling of post-hardcore that has dominated most of the 2000s.   I think Anthony's issue is that he thinks that DGD take their music fairly seriously and expect the album to reflect that. If you want the campy horror movie and think that's amazing, that's your opinion. Anthony's obviously not into that."
fantanoforever,338lqb,dreamleaking,-6,Tue Apr 21 03:47:33 2015 UTC,"My point was that Anthony doesn't seem to understand that maybe DGD wasn't taking themselves incredibly seriously when they wrote the lyrics he is treating like they are supposed to be poetry. He is judging against the wrong standard. It's like critiquing Killer Clowns From Outer Space for not being enough like The Exorcist.   He just straight up has no attention for any variation on hardcore punk from the last 15 years or so and it is clear any time he reviews any of them. His Hotelier review was shit, even though I agree with his overall score. He said ETID has bad lyrics which is easily one of the more bizarre opinions he has IMO. He complained that PBTT sounded too much like American Football! At no point has he ever given me any reason to respect his opinions about these genres.   As far as I can tell, he only listens to the ""major"" releases and makes some snap judgements about them while reciting the same spiel at the beginning of each review (for emo it's ""I get that it's not supposed to be progressive and groundbreaking, but...""). He likes the big name indie blog hype machine acts like La Dispute and Touche Amore and that's it. Why should I care about his opinion on a genre he knows so little about?"

fantanoforever,32kfr0,GemKnightTourmaline,11,Tue Apr 14 15:14:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I think hes spot on. Had to keep changing the volume as I was listening.  I feel like I just grew out of Tylers style and expected him to do the same and evolve.
fantanoforever,32kfr0,benji1the1dog,6,Tue Apr 14 15:14:58 2015 UTC,"This, 1000x this."

fantanoforever,32kfr0,Bluecool,13,Tue Apr 14 23:48:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Tyler fan, i like the album from the 3 spins I've had of it so far. Just wondering why Anthony says he ""can't make out what the lyrics are saying"" as a major gripe of the album, why does he not use it as a negative when Death Grips release lyrics to their songs on release of an LP as Stefan Burnett is so hard to understand?"
fantanoforever,32kfr0,JackdawsBeforeHoes,12,Mon Apr 20 15:41:51 2015 UTC,"Its not the vocal delivery thats the issue, the mastering and production makes it hard to hear him over the instrumentals"
fantanoforever,32kfr0,xMrBlonde,10,Wed Apr 15 00:48:31 2015 UTC,If it's an artistic choice how does that differ from Stefan's choice to not enunciate?
fantanoforever,32kfr0,JackdawsBeforeHoes,-3,Tue Apr 14 21:46:16 2015 UTC,It's not an artistic choice it's a mistake  I mean its not a good choice and we can judge if it makes the album better or worse and it definitely makes it worse
fantanoforever,32kfr0,xMrBlonde,7,Tue Apr 14 21:48:11 2015 UTC,There's interviews with Tyler where he says he wants the beat and everything to overpower his voice because his lyrics don't matter. I'm heavily paraphrasing and he could be fucking around but this isn't the first album he's produced. I doubt this was a mistake that he just didn't notice
fantanoforever,32kfr0,Billyprice,3,Tue Apr 14 21:52:50 2015 UTC,"If for a rapper lyrics don't matter, well, there is not much respect left for him"

fantanoforever,32kjqy,TweetPoster,10,Tue Apr 14 15:13:24 2015 UTC,Seems to be pretty direct as I haven't seen any other reviews. I don't disagree with Fantano though... production seemed a little questionable and I really grew out of Tylers style
fantanoforever,32kjqy,benji1the1dog,6,Tue Apr 14 16:21:05 2015 UTC,There's other reviews out already http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/13/tyler-the-creator-cherry-bomb-album-review
fantanoforever,32kjqy,berniamacattack,-6,Tue Apr 14 17:56:24 2015 UTC,"3/10 though? And the review jumped back in forth between caring about every verse that could be viewed as immature in any way, and then completely ignoring the rest of the lyrics. The production on the album is way, way too good to just ignore."
fantanoforever,32kjqy,ArchaicDiabolist,15,Tue Apr 14 19:33:40 2015 UTC,"You think the production is good? It seems poorly balanced for at least half of the album in my opinion.   The thing is that Tyler has done this edgy act for a while and it seems to be a little grating for people at this point.  The lyrics really are nothing spectacular and if you cant hear them on a song or two because of the production whats the point? Show me some lyrics you think are impressive. I'm on my 4th or fifth time through (not including already hearing the singles from before) and almost nothing spectacular has stuck out at me that wasn't a feature.  I would have given it a 5/10. I think it was cool that Tyler branched out and tried new things, produced, got fucking Kanye on this thing, and released a 'surprise' album. I just don't think it landed well."
fantanoforever,32kjqy,benji1the1dog,2,Tue Apr 14 19:40:17 2015 UTC,"I've listened to it 4 times already as well, honestly nothing overly spectacular. And it just gets more annoying every listen that I still fail to hear the lyrics over a lot of these irritating beats. It is just annoying at this point.   His whole edgy schtick is just super irritating now. (See his twitter, he still does his whole edgy thing still people) and like you said the lyrics aren't impressive. Hell most of them don't seem to ""fit"" in my opinion.  I'm sticking with what I said as the album being a 5 out of 10 to me as well."
fantanoforever,32kla0,GemKnightTourmaline,5,Tue Apr 14 15:24:42 2015 UTC,I went to an intimidate afternoon with Anthony Fantano and have nothing but good things to say about it.
fantanoforever,32kla0,cleaver112,4,Wed Apr 15 11:50:08 2015 UTC,What all did he talk about?
fantanoforever,32kla0,cleaver112,3,Wed Apr 15 13:43:13 2015 UTC,He made a few jokes about Australia and went on to talk about the music industry. At the time it was the U2 & iTunes debacle. He went into a lot more depth after that. Cal joined in and at the end Anthony hosted a Q&A. After the show he was happy to have a meet and greet to sign posters or have a chat.

Remember when Anthony used to go outside at the beginning of his interviews? He'd usually shout the album and artist as an intro to the review, sometimes he'd say nothing or nonsense. On /r/hiphopheads, someone posted in response to Fantano criticism:   I miss when each review would start with him GOING OUTSIDE   That got me thinking: when did Fantano stop going outside (you know, like the title ""[...] I Don't Go Outside""). After clicking through reviews, the last two reviews in which he did an outside intro were:   Washed Out - Paracosm (granted, he didn't actually go outside for this one, but it still counts!) No Age - An Object   The next review, the first time he ""[didn't] go outside"", was the Earl Sweatshirt - Doris review.  Pretty spooky stuff."

fantanoforever,305yvg,giallojello,8,Tue Mar 24 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"Does anyone else think that the reason he's been using his end tags to promote other youtubers is in response to that Ricky guy who was saying that he never promoted his channel and shit? The guy seemed to think Anthony never helped anyone else on youtube but always asked others for help. I dunno, just a theory."
fantanoforever,305yvg,FrankinComesAlive,2,Wed Mar 25 04:07:26 2015 UTC,"Source on this ""Ricky guy"" saying this? Not that I doubt you, I'm just curious as to what this guy actually said."
fantanoforever,305yvg,In_Ultraviolet,4,Wed Mar 25 05:14:32 2015 UTC,"Somewhere in this video he says something about how Anthony never promoted other channels or at least, never promoted this guys channel. The whole thing seems really insane, but Anthony has referenced this ""feud"" in other videos so he knows about it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDD9RJV6QME"
fantanoforever,305yvg,FrankinComesAlive,7,Wed Mar 25 05:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah this guy seems like...kinda paranoid. I really want to know more of Anthony's take on this. Thanks for sharing this too!  EDIT: This only gets worse as this goes on, I almost don't want to finish watching this. Him complaining about Anthony liking the same bands as him (bands that are critically acclaimed ACROSS THE BOARD) is fucking absurd.  EDIT2: ""Can't you give me some credit?""   Credit for what? Both of you guys liking Fever Ray? This makes my fucking blood boil...  EDIT3: talking about how he's copying the colors of the walls in their sketches... this is fucking infuriating"
fantanoforever,305yvg,In_Ultraviolet,5,Wed Mar 25 08:41:29 2015 UTC,"When he claims he introduced Anthony to 4chan which then Anthony used to sock puppet to change public opinion...so many laughs.  ""You'll be a substitute for a therapist"" says it all, IMO"

It's just a desperate attempt to cash in on Anthony's success and that is when I stopped watching it. Realizing that this exactly what he wants. Even if people hate their content, views translate to something in his mind, I imagine, so I shouldn't validate his (dare I say) insanity."

I know it's a shitty thing to say but I feel it deep down in my gut.  However I do for the most part agree with the rest of the review (except him not liking Black Quarterback wtf man).

fantanoforever,2zw9lf,NefariousBanana,119,Sun Mar 22 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"Man I hate the term SJW. Fantano's clearly a SJW because he's advocating for social justice in this very response. It's as meaningless a term as ""hipster"" except it's worse because it blankets in people who advocate for real social change with people who have sophomoric views on social issues and extremists.  It's nothing more than a silencing technique used when people get uncomfortable when confronted with difficult ideas."
fantanoforever,2zw9lf,nfreakoss,35,Sun Mar 22 16:21:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's just refering to the extreme end of the spectrum, one which Fantono's responding to here. Genuine, logical and passionate advocates for social justice are just that. The ""warrior"" part is sarcastic I believe"
fantanoforever,2zw9lf,HamburgerDude,35,Sun Mar 22 14:10:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah somewhere along the line ""SJW"" became a slur for anyone who had even the mildest left leaning social justice opinions, rather than labeling the obnoxious contrarian zealots you find on Tumblr and Twitter. The ""W"" shrinked and the ""SJ"" got bigger.   Hell, like the original commenter said, by the definition of some of his beliefs, Anthony would be a SJW in the eyes of some because he's strongly against racism and the concept of ""white guilt""."
fantanoforever,2zw9lf,HamburgerDude,17,Sun Mar 22 17:27:51 2015 UTC,Exactly this. Actual social justice is a great thing and is something to push for. SJW is typically used to refer to these kinds of idiot extremists.
fantanoforever,2zw9lf,NefariousBanana,8,Sun Mar 22 18:53:55 2015 UTC,"I originally associated with like otherkin people who think they are vampires or lightbulbs or something like that TiA was originally supposed to be about before it turned into a shit fest.

fantanoforever,2zgv1b,Wiamly,10,Thu Mar 19 01:04:57 2015 UTC,"Love this review!    A few things I think Anthony didn't touch on (this is just my opinion; some/all of it could be somewhat/completely wrong):   In the track where he's quoting his grandmother, I think she's referring to him needing to 'wash himself' of friends who represent a certain substance. The lyrics about him being institutionalized in that track are from the perspective of his friends, similar to 'sing about me I'm dying of thirst,' who later in the album seem to have been abandoned (basing this on the skit where one leaves a voicemail saying 'all I get is your answering machine'). Those friends are caterpillars Kendrick needed to get rid of because they were toxic to / didn't understand him. The way they sap him of his energy won't change until he rids himself of their bad influence. In the second track the girl refers to her 'uncle Sam' which I think makes it have some sort of symbolic significance. Perhaps this track represents the metamorphosis of Kendrick from track 1 (where he's the caterpillar; suffering with a negative mindset) to track 3 (where he's the butterfly; confident, successful, and transformed), in that he's almost rabidly refuting what he has been told (that he's some commodity to be exploited etc). I think the cocoon is self isolation due to depression, hence not being able to see 'past your own thoughts,' which is a huge handicap in that someone being trapped in their head all day can't focus on what they need to do to escape (hence becoming institutionalized), but long term leads to the new perspective that allows them to become the butterfly. Tupac is a victim of being a butterfly 'pimped by a caterpillar' in that someone, presumably from the ghetto, killed him due to (presumably) a combination of short shortsightedness and desperation.  The track with the 'on the verge of tears' delivery where the friend says things like 'A true friend never leaves Compton for profit' is another example of someone being a caterpillar; the friend lacks the ability to understand what Kendrick has become. So in addition to it being Kendrick criticizing himself, I think it's also a window into the pain his success has caused others who no longer understand him. As well as relating to each track, the point of the spoken snippets is to build a bunch of suspense in the viewer's mind, who wants to find out what's going on (this might be stating the obvious). The sample at the beginning, in addition to communicating the idea that every caterpillar has the potential to be a butterfly, uses a hard R when referring to the former group in order to communicate a negative connotation, because - as Kendrick says on track 16 - the world hates the caterpillar. I'm not sure if Kendrick was thinking about this at the time of writing, but there's a strange discordance between the world hating the caterpillar and loving the butterfly, when in Kendrick's opinion they're both different stages of the same thing, which is something Tupac has said in interviews ('people hate the ghetto but get culture, fashion, music, etc from it'); given the obscure interview he sampled for the album outro, Kendrick is probably familiar with much of what Tupac has said on public record. Regarding the whole ""love and respect yourself"" angle, whether or not you agree with him, that he made this album the way he did is IMO compelling evidence that he practices what he preaches. The way Kendrick really threw everything he had into making this, despite having the natural talent to make a profitable album with less effort, resulted in something absolutely incredible. In my opinion that's something we can all learn from.   I think there's a lot more to this album than what has been spoken on so far and I hope people continue to unpack it"

To me his lyrics are no less complex - and enriching - than the stuff we would read for timed writes.  I'm not sure if everything I said was correct but I'm glad it was thought provoking!

fantanoforever,2zgv1b,Sir_Deimos,8,Wed Mar 18 14:33:26 2015 UTC,"I didn't think I'd live to see another 10. friends, this is a historic day. you'll tell your kids about the day Kenthony Lamtano gave To Pimp a Butterfly a 10."
fantanoforever,2zgv1b,FrankinComesAlive,15,Wed Mar 18 23:55:44 2015 UTC,"HEY OP! DON'T PUT THE SCORE IN THE TITLE, YA FUCKIN' DINGUS! I'M ACTUALLY YELLING THIS RIGHT NOW."
fantanoforever,2zgv1b,dreamleaking,12,Wed Mar 18 22:38:49 2015 UTC,I expected a strong six-light seven due to his habit of giving boundary pushing hip-hop six unless it's noise-hop.  (This is only kind of a joke.)
fantanoforever,2zgv1b,FrankinComesAlive,4,Wed Mar 18 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was half expecting him to talk about the album itself for 2 minutes after talking about who Kendrick Lamar was for 10 minutes and then say something that makes it clear he skipped half the album and then give it a 6/10. Yes, I'm still bitter about A Toothpaste Suburb.   He's even worse on emo albums, though."
fantanoforever,2zgv1b,dreamleaking,4,Thu Mar 19 00:06:03 2015 UTC,"I'm also bitter about A Toothpaste Suburb, especially since it was just as good or better as those EP's he loved and it seemed like him and Milo were friends.  I mean I'm not sure how happy I am about him giving this a ten, I mean he's breaking his own mold and it seems like he's paying more attention to this than he normally gives hip-hop albums, but I don't think I'm ready to say it's a ten myself."
fantanoforever,2zgv1b,FrankinComesAlive,3,Thu Mar 19 03:55:21 2015 UTC,"I like it, a lot actually, but I don't think it's a 10. However, I do agree with him that it's better than GKMC, which he gave a 9. So, he's being consistent within his own criteria, at least.   But him rating Day/Night higher than ATS wasn't the real kick in the teeth for me. It was that he gave I Wish My Brother Rob Was Here an 8. A fucking 8!"
fantanoforever,2zgv1b,spanied,3,Thu Mar 19 04:05:16 2015 UTC,I like it a lot but I don't know if I like it more than GKMC yet.

fantanoforever,2zgv1b,Flannel_Friday,-12,Fri Mar 20 21:54:46 2015 UTC,"This whole videos seems like a product promotion instead of a well rounded album review.  Obviously I know that TDE didn't buy off Anthony but he seems to be suffering from the hype.  I think his interest in black issues and social justice leaked into this review.  It's a great album, but it's not perfect"

fantanoforever,2zjlks,petertrempe,2,Thu Mar 19 03:51:28 2015 UTC,"Well put!!  I couldn't agree more about the bam bamm boomers!!  I felt that they 'freshened up' their sound very nicely to keep up with and in certain areas, continue to dominate, a field of music largely populated by artists that they themselves influenced.   Their beep beep boops were a very integral part of their sound, and to hear the revamping of their own work, with such reinvigorated feeling and texture was inspiring, and I feel, a huge success.  Thank you for your response!!"

Intro song followed by the incessant ramblings of a hipster skinhead. He even mentions hanging African Americans several times during this review, also showing a picture of a homeless black man standing at the edge of a tall building, some say that is a picture Anthony took before he yelled ""THIS IS SPARTA"" and kicked him off. He even features one of his slaves ""Big Quinn"" at the end of the video.  If you can look past the racism of the review though, it's a pleasant watch with interesting edits. Light to descent 7"

Nujabes /ˈnudʒɑːbɛs/ was an anagram of his name, being the reverse spelling of Seba Jun. He was the owner of the Shibuya record stores, T Records and Guinness Records and founder of the independent label Hydeout Productions. His style mixes hip hop, rap and jazz samples. Nujabes collaborated with other Japanese artists such as Uyama Hiroto, Shing02 (with whom he created the critically acclaimed ""Luv(sic)"" hexalogy), Minmi, and was also involved with America's underground hip hop scene through collaboration with CYNE, Apani B, Five Deez, Substantial, CL Smooth, Fat Jon, and Terry Callier. In his career he released five studio albums (Metaphorical Music in 2003, Samurai Champloo Music Record: Departure and Impression in 2004, Modal Soul in 2005, and Spiritual State which was incomplete upon his death released by Hydeout Productions in 2011).

Whether you like Fantano's reviews or not, it's obvious especially now with their latest series that they're entitled, talentless, unoriginal YouTube brats dying for hits. I'm genuinely disturbed that the latest videos they've posted about TND contain a baby. This is what your parents spent your first years on earth doing? Fuck them.

fantanoforever,2wvr6d,BadVsEvil,7,Mon Feb 23 16:14:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, can someone give me a quick history of what this guy is? I've never heard of him or his channel, and he talks really vaguely about everything.  He says that Anthony sent him music? I know he did covers but did he make music? Also he doesn't really seem to understand things like Anthony's rating system. And talking about his channel art? Can some one point me to what that even means? I know he's got that yellow stuff but I thought that was fan submitted?  I mean, I'm not trying to dismiss his claims but his seemingly semi-knowledge of Anthony's channel doesn't seem like he even has enough knowledge about it to say that he's copying him.  I mean he seemed like he had something to say until he acted like he had a trademark on being a Kate Bush and Stooges fan at the same time. Then it just became paranoid."
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,FrankinComesAlive,5,Mon Feb 23 21:22:14 2015 UTC,"if you visit the noodledroop tumblr page you'll see most of the stuff to which he alludes, but it's friggin mental. jealousy, entirely. Comparing Robert Altman & PTA's relationship to that of him and Fantano is such a class-jump, a compositional fallacy. Fantano has not plagiarized in any way."
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,Encyclopedia5,4,Tue Feb 24 05:28:57 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, just putting together this tumblr, seems totally bonkers. I mean he acts like he doesn't care in that video but this suggests something very different."
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,FrankinComesAlive,2,Tue Feb 24 06:12:06 2015 UTC,"the tumblr reads like the work of an obsessive compulsive. the worst part is that he's generated a lot more traffic to his videos through this ""accusation"" (if you can even call his aimless complaining an accusation.)"
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,Encyclopedia5,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:36:08 2015 UTC,"The other thing I find really strange is that Anthony really just seems(or seemed) like he was just a fan of this guy. I mean, sure there might be a sense of ""community"" on youtube but he really is acting like Anthony OWES him something. I mean, maybe he did more promoting for Anthony than Anthony did back, but really he didn't have to promote Anthony at all, and really should you do kind things and expect more in return? Seems like Anthony showed him a regular fan level of admiration, comments, the occasional shoutout, etc. So this guy was kind back even more than Anthony originally was,then got mad when Anthony didn't step up his kindness in return as if he was owed that kindness.  I dunno this whole thing is very strange. I mean, I enjoy Fantano's videos, but I'm not above being shown evidence that maybe he's a jerk behind the scenes or the potential that he stole ideas, but this doesn't really convince me of anything."
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,FrankinComesAlive,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"yeah, same. i searched and searched for video evidence that Fantano stole anything other than Alex's taste in music (lmao) and came up empty-minded."
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,Encyclopedia5,1 point,Tue Feb 24 22:06:56 2015 UTC,"a few things I noticed on his video and the noodledrop tumblr, first the video is a regurgitation, sometimes verbatim, of the bullshit that's posted on tumblr, yet he calls out Fantano time and time again for jump cuts and checking his notes? This fucking guy belabored over his tumblr so hard that he has what he wrote memorized. also the accusations of ""plagarism"" are a little far-fetched but maybe he's right. still, it just says to me that he's stalked the shit out of Fantano for years. gathering evidence, screen grabbing his pages. how many videos did he have to watch for the beigegate comparison? this kid is a prick. read the comments on the video - he and his wife took money to make a movie from old fans and all the donors have received are the Fantano attack videos. his tweets sound like by not denying it, Fantano is only proving more so that he copied ricky shore. if he did deny it, do you think he'd let it all go or say he's more guilty by denying it?   TL;DR law student reads into beigegate, beigegate perp insane"
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,throwawaytimetoday22,1 point,Tue Feb 24 16:36:09 2015 UTC,i'm not quite sure what your argument or point is with this comment?
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,Encyclopedia5,1 point,Tue Feb 24 18:34:43 2015 UTC,"i don't have any argument. i'm just sharing observations from looking into this one-sided feud.   ricky shore calls out fantano for reading notes and cutting around it, centering ""gags"" around this in videos. yet his 20 minute video against fantano is the same bullshit that's in his tumblr, whether he's reading it or has it memorized because he's obsessed over it so much. hypocritical. ricky shore's tumblr is 100x more obsessive as he accuses fantao of being. it must have taken so long to gather all of this ""evidence"". who's really stalking who? unrelated but comments from (former) ricky shore fans show that he took money donated to make an independent film that never got made. instead the project morphed into what the series he's now using to attack TND. ripoff artist.   fantano can't win with this guy and he's doing the best thing by ignoring it. ricky shore being so desperate for attention, hits and controversy can't accept that he looks like a jerkoff and is acting like a 14 year old girl so he keeps egging the situation on saying ""you're scared"" on twitter. seems like a real cool guy."
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,throwawaytimetoday22,1 point,Tue Feb 24 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"ahh ok, yep. all these observations are correctamundo. Ricky Shore does seem like an asshole. He's also soooooooo obsessed with Fantano. I watched a boatload of his web series stuff last night and early morn, and it's so bad. He's like the worst, most adolescent and pretentious version of David Lynch imaginable. Also the guy can't act for sh*t.   And yeah, HUGE rip-off artist. he seems like an absolute screwball. one of those guys you went to college with who was helplessly unsociable, rude, and constantly rode on an imaginary high horse."
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,Encyclopedia5,2,Tue Feb 24 22:11:05 2015 UTC,"glad we're on the same page. the web series is poorly made unfunny shit. it's one thing to make a shitty web series - let's say that has it's merits, you're at least CREATING something - but to come flying at someone like TND so hard and with such excitement and force to ""call them out"" just seems like some neglected piece of shit thirsty for attention and fucking jealous that he's not getting it and Fantano is.  who is itching for conflict that bad?   it's funny to see the comments on that noodle droop vs. ricky shore video (which happens to have the most views of any of ricky shore's recent videos, go figure) - people who were once fans or followers of his have turned against him for this. even if they're not fans of TND i think they realize this kid is just full of shit.  can we talk again about the care he put into the fantano fan page? the time stamps are all from the same day. all of those screen grabs and all of the ""research"" for ""evidence"" he did must have taken forever. seriously, who's obsessed and stalking who?  ugh so annoyed by these people - just someone making such a shit case against someone and being such a prick pisses me off."
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,throwawaytimetoday22,2,Wed Feb 25 00:31:11 2015 UTC,"exactly.  And then he calls out Fantano for having ""vague"" descriptions and and critiques in his albums reviews, meanwhile Rick Shore's Best Movies of 2014 video is the most unsupported, vague, subjective-for-subjectivity's sake piece of shit I've ever watched. He calls Bridman bad because ""it just is"" and ""i hate it"" along with several other movies.  What a pretentious asshole."
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,Encyclopedia5,4,Thu Feb 26 23:09:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, I've watched some videos of this guy like 5 years ago where he talks about doing shrooms or something like that.  The video is so weird that I'm not sure if this is performance art. But from the reactions it doesn't seem like it, so maybe he's just psychotic?  I mean, just look at this Tumblr where he shows how Anthony ""copied"" him: http://thenoodledroop.tumblr.com/ (he also leaked an old bedroom pop bandcamp from Anthony there)  Poor Anthony, wouldn't want to be in his awkward shoes. (because he's a fan of his videos and liked him after all)"
fantanoforever,2wvr6d,uqab,3,Tue Feb 24 03:05:01 2015 UTC,I don't understand any of this.

fantanoforever,2wvr6d,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Mon Feb 23 23:59:19 2015 UTC,I found RSStB because of Anthony back in 2009 or so.  I thought it was pretty funny but I never once thought of any connection between Anthony's comedy in his videos and Alex's comedy.  I'm kinda hoping this is some elaborate joke from Alex but the more I see the less I think that's even remotely possible.

fantanoforever,2syehw,Viraus2,19,Tue Jan 20 03:36:43 2015 UTC,"Mac Miller's Faces. It was definitely one of my favorite albums/mixtapes of last year.  Its kinda funny though, because Anthony predicted the reaction I would have in the review."
fantanoforever,2syehw,IronicButterfly,11,Mon Jan 19 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"The St. Vincent review was harsh, which even Anthony himself later acknowledged."
fantanoforever,2syehw,marco_esquandolas,12,Mon Jan 19 22:53:31 2015 UTC,"CLPPNG was easily my favorite release of 2014, I think it was fantastic in many ways, funny how opinions work, haha.  And personally, I think I would have given BBNG's III a higher rating, I enjoyed it immensely."
fantanoforever,2syehw,mcquarrie,1 point,Mon Jan 19 18:09:07 2015 UTC,Why did you tihnk CLPPNG was so good?
fantanoforever,2syehw,mcquarrie,8,Mon Jan 19 18:48:40 2015 UTC,"In a general sense, I really enjoy some abrasive noise music, and their use of it, integrating it into a distinctly hip hop and still varied aesthetic is just great. On top of that, you have Digg's narrative style rapping that really wraps up the group's work as a whole. All that talent in one place makes for some of the most interesting music out there."
fantanoforever,2syehw,typhyr,2,Tue Jan 20 05:16:59 2015 UTC,"I think CLPPNG was the #1 release of 2014. Daveed's voice is perfect for rap, very articulate, clean, fast. Daveed's lyrics are fantastic, able to be sonically pleasing at points and very honest and descriptive at others. The production is amazing, with ingenious sounds (alarm clock for a song about getting back to the daily grind on the streets? beautiful) and some truly spot-on ideas (Story 2's time signature increasing to make the song feel like it's stretching out until the conflict arises, as if time slows to a crawl until the realization hits, it's incredible imagery coming from just the feel of the song). The whole album is complex and interesting, to the point where I can't ever focus on one thing so I just HAVE to listen again. The only song I was disappointed with was Tonight, the singing was odd.   But hell, I like Williams Mix, so my opinion is coming from someone who likes noise a LOT.  Edit: I'd also like to point out the vocal layering on certain words/phrases/rhymes on most tracks. It's genius for accenting certain lyrics, and I love it."
fantanoforever,2syehw,bulletfastspeed,2,Tue Jan 20 07:34:01 2015 UTC,"Personally, I loved many tracks, but I do think it was a but overrated. Should have gotten a 7 or 8 imo. Some songs were pretty boring. But others (Story 2, Inside Out, Intro, Get Up, Dominoes) were damn amazing."
fantanoforever,2syehw,curebdc,11,Tue Jan 20 00:05:40 2015 UTC,Serious? CLPPNG was awesome imo
fantanoforever,2syehw,spp41,2,Mon Jan 19 18:46:59 2015 UTC,I wish the lyrics were as interesting as the production tho
fantanoforever,2syehw,xMrBlonde,-5,Tue Jan 20 12:11:42 2015 UTC,"Why? I found it boring and annoying in a lot of places. The album makes me sad, because it has potential, and then we get these shitty songs like Get Up"

fantanoforever,2syehw,gcultrep9,1 point,Mon Jan 19 21:19:04 2015 UTC,"yeah I just liked the majority of stuff on it. My initial reaction was like, why cant they all be 'work work'? but on listening to it more, its just so layered and so methodical and genuinely industrial... I'ts way more complicated than it needs to be, yet oddly catchy. If you listen to older stuff of theirs its way fuzzier and minimal, this newest is still their boldest and best. Just my opinion tho.

fantanoforever,2j87hs,FrankinComesAlive,3,Tue Oct 14 20:06:54 2014 UTC,"Jaden Smith's new song was dope.  Maybe I am the only one.   Here is one verse from Melancholy. Do you think this is Jaden  ""Keeping it Real"" or just some rich kid being a pretender?  ""Man you guys are just some rich kids  How dare you call yourself the misfits  Hope you get coals in your presents come Christmas  Man I'm sorry, I ain't eat today  Cause I didn't know what I should eat today  Full or hungry, don't know what the difference is  I just hope we work out all our differences  Cause I be flyin' where them pigeons is""  Now take virtually any lyric from an Eminem song, and compare the authenticity.  This incarnation of Jaden Smith is as fake as a boy band.  My guess is that nobody else wanted to be in his band.  All the best singers, sing from the heart.  ""Melancholy"" is Jaden reading some other kids homework to background music."
fantanoforever,2j87hs,tenminuteslate,5,Wed Oct 15 03:17:15 2014 UTC,"First of all putting too much value on authenticity especially in hip-hop goes down a slippeery slope. Sure a lot of the best hip-hop is ""keeping it real"" but a lot of hip-hop is about performance, fake stories, showmanship, rap names. That doesn't automatically make it bad. In fact, look at all of Eminem's ""joke"" songs. That's all Eminem putting on a character (I'm sure you could argue the rest of his career is much the same but I don't listen to him enough to form that argument.)  I see the song as him struggling with his identity as an extremely wealthy teenager who is expected to be certain ways because he's rich, but then is also similarly getting pressure from people like you, who call him inauthentic. As if that is the be-all-end-all.  Anyway what parts of these lyrics do you think are inauthentic? I have a hard time assuming any of these lines are false. There's nothing about them that don't line up with any story I've been presented about his life.  Edit: Also I was more referring to the song ""Fast"" which I just think is banging."

Also did a really good bit about the commodification of music and how artists have their music used in advertising of other products, why it's good/bad.

He just didn't really go as into detail as he normally does and it just really seemed like he didn't listen to the album as much as he normally does.  I mean the fact that he didn't take the time to even address Kool A.D.'s verse was a bit odd, since that was a real stand out moment on the record. It just seemed like if you thought Things that Happen at Day/Night were EP's of the year how could you think this was a 5? I mean it does feel like a lot of the same, but it's a solid record."

fantanoforever,2hg6vp,GabeTheBabe5,7,Thu Sep 25 17:49:08 2014 UTC,I think that Fantango was pretty spot on with this review. I personally wasn't a massive fan of anything on the album. Like nothing outshined the rest to me.   What did you all think of it?
fantanoforever,2hg6vp,GemKnightTourmaline,3,Thu Sep 25 17:59:28 2014 UTC,"Agreed. I don't wanna say that it's a poor project in any sense because there wasn't anything I felt super negative about, but I can't say there was anything I felt really positive on it either.  I like that DOOM took Bishop under his wing with the project, but neither of them really delivered the product people were hyping them up to. In fact, I think Bishop is even lazier with his verses on this than he did with Nehruvia. The fact that he's so young acts as a handicap for him as a rapper, but I don't think he's breaking out of it with his verses like he needs to. Like ""Mean The Most"". That track was like Disney grade for me.  It has some of the cleanest production by DOOM I've heard, but that's not to say it kept me coming back like Take Me To Your Leader. Some tracks sounded like scrapped drafts of songs DOOM had done before, like ""Coming For You"", which sounded like it could've been off of MM FOOD.   The whole album just felt too familiar to be surprising."

Feels more put together, to me, at least. Though I feel more as if I have to listen to the whole album straight through more than with UD02, which is both a good and a bad thing.  I was disappointed when I first saw Kyoto wasn't on the tracklist as well, but I think it sounds too different to actually fit anywhere on the album. The whole thing sounds more like Yoshi City than Kyoto, and they're very different songs. I tacked Kyoto onto the end when I burned it onto a CD, and even though I love the song, I usually end up stopping the album before it [Kyoto] begins because it sounds so different."
fantanoforever,2h5gkj,Puzzular,1 point,Tue Sep 23 13:25:06 2014 UTC,"I actually felt the opposite, it actually took me a few times to finish the album because I wasn't compelled to keep going. Don't get me wrong, there are some tracks I really like, but I feel UD just had more.  If an album was made in the style of Kyoto, with that quality of production and Lean's vocals, it would be fucking amazing."

fantanoforever,2erx6d,In_Ultraviolet,12,Mon Sep 22 05:22:02 2014 UTC,"It's disingenuous to claim media has no effect on perpetuating stereotypes. Fandingle is trying to get people to change society's ""reality"" , but isn't media a very real and powerful aspect of society?  Anyways, I think Anita's goal was to point out tropes and inspire discussion, not to censor games. i'm not changing the games I play because of it, like i'm not deleting my songs that have offensive content in them, but it helps to recognize these problems because it's the first step in solving them"
fantanoforever,2erx6d,DocSub,9,Thu Aug 28 19:45:35 2014 UTC,His premise is disproved by the constant rape threats and misogynistic insults that she's been the recipient of since she started the series. I like Anthony but this is a disappointingly misguided post.
fantanoforever,2erx6d,DocSub,5,Thu Aug 28 15:47:48 2014 UTC,What is trolling. It's some immature edgy teen behind a keyboard. What real effect are they going to have?

fantanoforever,2erx6d,DocSub,5,Thu Aug 28 19:28:43 2014 UTC,"Well everyone gets harnessed on the internet all the time.    Most women online, especially those who are involved in feminism or the game industry or both, get torrential amounts of targeted abuse designed to create fear. Stuff like rape threats that include their address and absolute certainty of intent. This isn't equivalent to being called a fag on 4chan or whatever, it is abuse that can cause fear and even trauma."
fantanoforever,2erx6d,Redner,1 point,Thu Aug 28 19:41:37 2014 UTC,I wouldn't say it's made to create fear. People on 4chan do things like that because it gets a reaction. I do admit it can go overboard though.

That is violent, psychopathic, misogynist, criminal behavior. And all because she had the nerve to suggest that game developers be more aware of how they treat female characters."

fantanoforever,2erx6d,DiscipleofDong,3,Thu Aug 28 20:25:33 2014 UTC,"She's writing about misogyny and ""rape culture"" in video games, what do you think detractors are going to respond with? Her receiving rape threats and misogynistic insults is purely anecdotal ""evidence"" of a larger problem.   Not saying that there isn't a problem simply that you can't use the response to her post as a justification of what she says."
fantanoforever,2erx6d,BobRossNTV,6,Thu Aug 28 20:50:34 2014 UTC,"Well, the more important point is that her series DOESNT focus on how games could influence their players. It's merely about how these tropes are lazy and that it's problematic how little thought game developers put into their portrayal/treatment of female characters."
fantanoforever,2erx6d,Devasaurus,4,Thu Aug 28 21:10:26 2014 UTC,"I just watched her first video and a little bit of the most recent one and definitely think she has good intentions and isn't trying to ""ruin the fun"" or censor games but a good portion of her examples make me feel like they're pulled out of the context which creates bias.   For example strip clubs or prostitution are commonly associated with ""bad guys"" and lowlifes so it would make sense that a game like hitman or mafia would feature a bunch of scenes in strip clubs. Anita paints this picture (most likely unintentionally) that the games are just throwing strip clubs all over the place, this is why Anthony comments on her being an ""outsider""."

fantanoforever,28axaj,dong_lover,1 point,Tue Jun 17 18:22:56 2014 UTC,The general gist of that review was that Uffie didn't seem to remotely display any sort of talent on the album. And just a few seconds of listening is enough confirmation.  Here's a single from that album - dear god.

fantanoforever,28axaj,zaviex,3,Tue Jun 17 06:12:13 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that was kind of an ironic score. Considering that for most of the video he's not actually even talking about the album, and that the score itself is not in the description box.   EDIT: The description even says ""This is a rare and secret review most people will never understand. If you guys start a flame war in the comments, you really have learned nothing."" I doubt that that 0/10 was a legitimate score.  Source"

And 11 of the 14 tracks were marked among his favorites in the description - that's all of them but ""Tonight"", ""Dream"", and ""Williams Mix"".

He came onto the stage and sat down with a guitar and introduced himself in the typical fashion ""Hello I'm Anthony Fantano, The Internets Busiest music nerd"". He started to play the guitar but it was really out of tune so he sat there for a couple minutes tuning it. When he finished tuning it he just put it down without playing a song, revealing the whole guitar tuning was a gag. The next of the night was him talking about subjects such as Death Grips, ""le wrong generation"" kids, and how to live your dream. At the end of all of that Cal Chuchesta made an appearance in a video. He wrapped up the night with a Q&A. Afterwards he hung around his merch booth to talk to the fans and take pictures. They filmed the whole night so I'm assuming it will end up on his channel eventually!"

fantanoforever,244ozk,card28,1 point,Mon Apr 28 02:53:40 2014 UTC,"He gave Hopsin and Gambino very negative reviews (and that's perfectly fine) but commended their lyrical and technical skills.  Meanwhile he acknowledges ASAP Rocky isn't a great lyricist, but the production on his tracks are great. Both of his reviews on Rocky got a strong 7 to a light 8.  And he hardly gives a shit at all what MC Ride is saying.  So yeah, he is definitely more production than lyrics oriented."

What are your thoughts on the recent trend of micro genres (witch house, cloud rap, vaporwave, etc.) popping up? I don't really mind it, but a lot of people get very irate at even the mention of such terms. I personally think there is no harm in grouping artists who make like minded music together(cloud rap for example), but I can see why people would be dismissive of things like sea-punk when it really only establishes a visual aesthetic and not a sound."
fantanoforever,23wcob,giraffeking,80,Thu Apr 24 22:05:38 2014 UTC,"people gotta be careful w/micro genres. while genres are great when it comes to helping people find the sounds / artists they're interested in, as soon as that shit becomes passé, some of the artists that were lumped into said micro genre end up getting ignored.   personally, i don't have any issue with micro genres in theory, but i do tend to break balls on the ones that i think have failed to even muster up a decent project."
fantanoforever,23wcob,giraffeking,4,Thu Apr 24 22:19:35 2014 UTC,"Thanks for answering my question Anthony. I definitely agree that artists who align themselves with a trending genre get ignored when people move on to the next thing. I'm probably the first person to type 'witch house' in 2014.  One thing I would say about your last point is that in the internet age, I think you have to give genres time to mature. If you look at something like drone metal, there wasn't an explosion of artists jumping in after Earth 2, and that probably was for the best, as artists like Boris and Sunn O))) weren't considered tired by the time they appeared a few years later. I feel a little dirty comparing vaporwave to other genres, but given a few years maybe some genre defining great project will appear."

fantanoforever,23wcob,zaviex,88,Thu Apr 24 22:07:55 2014 UTC,"Do you legally purchase all the albums you review? You have a pretty quick turnaround time on reviews.

fantanoforever,23wcob,StevenSeagalFan,99,Thu Apr 24 22:10:48 2014 UTC,"i get a lot of promos, but buy the records i can't get a hold of that way / stream on spotify. i also buy the albums that i reviewed, and find myself coming back to.  depends on the artist / band / record / genre. how familiar i am with the sounds, complexity of the record, and a slew of other things. the turnaround is quick, but i may / may not be listening to multiple records over the course of a week on my turntable, my iphone, car, office, on a walk. i actually made a video about this a while ago. :-)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCbd1JC4Q78  i wouldn't. mostly because i just see my reviews as being snapshots of how i felt about something in the initial stages of it entering my life. perceptions change for the long-term, and i anticipate feeling different about many of the records i review 20 years from now. that's life, my son. some people don't wanna act that way, because ""classics"" are supposed to be ""timeless,"" but there's no way of knowing what of today's releases will reach that classic status 20 years from now. plus, there's plenty of stuff that doesn't get that ""classic"" tag that's great anyway. that mx-80 album hard attack has been one of my favorite records of last year, and i only heard of it cuz of a recent reissue."

fantanoforever,23wcob,Gitnerd,53,Thu Apr 24 22:18:46 2014 UTC,"While I don't have anything against what they do in principle, I obviously have what I view as a different review philosophy, or else there'd be no point in doing TND in the first place. If I 100% felt that I add nothing different to the current landscape of reviews, why try?  I don't really have time to and don't care to overanalyze who I'd approach every little thing P4K or Rolling Stone does. They seem to be doing fine on their respective business models--though I guess RS is losing ground with young readers.  Anyway, I just tend to see my videos as being more personal, passionate, straightforward, direct. It's just person to fucking person. I'm not trying to educate you, or make you feel like I'm doing something really special or impressive. I'm just trying to turn you on to something, really, and try to give you a heads up on what you can expect from a record. Maybe help you to get into it if my descriptions pique your interest.  It's super nerdy, but I try to make a stupid joke every once in a while to remind myself that there's no reason to take all this shit too serious."

I write a rap blog too and sometimes it's hard to find inspiration to continue racking your brain for how to describe what you're listening to.

fantanoforever,23wcob,Aligator_Pacino,41,Thu Apr 24 22:14:42 2014 UTC,"I'm sure dubstep will be remembered years from now, and the whole EDM craze. I'm sure trap will be remembered as well since it's such a distinct style / sound, and it's reached such a zenith, saturation point. Maybe the alternative movement that's be going on in hip hop recently, w/the industry embracing more alternative artists. Gangam style? Drake? Kanye? Lady Gaga?  However, that's still hard to confirm. I feel like trends today are reaching the same points of popularity they used to, but they're living for shorter periods of time, ya know? In the internet age, trends seem to be moving so quickly: growing, fading, etc. I think we have some big stars in music these days, but they need to keep changing their sound in order to stay relevant. Back in the 80s, a band like Devo could stay true to their sound for several records without having to worry. These days, artists are facing different sonic climates ever year. That's not to say their weren't awkward transitions back then, tho. Look at all of the punk / prog artists that did a terrible job of embracing the sounds that New Wave set into motion in the 80s."

fantanoforever,23wcob,Idmaneire,18,Thu Apr 24 22:25:10 2014 UTC,"Dear Mr.Fantano,  I was raised by a single mother who got her degree in Radio, Television, and Film. She has worked in public broadcasting for 30+ years. I was practically born and raised in public broadcasting stations. My first two years of college I even worked as a production technician at a PBS station. My current career path is unrelated but secure - A super secret dream of mine since childhood was to work for NPR in Washington as a media journalist.   Please tell me, as an established and recognied broadcaster, how much do you love radio? How did you get into it? Was it public or commercial? Was it hard to develop a personality and voice on-air that listeners found engaging? You obviously have already done that with your youtube series but as both you and I know without the medium of visual stimulus an engaging personality over the airwaves is a whole different ball game.  Sorry for the long string of questions and thanks for doing what you do. I know of numeous artist that have grown directly because of your influence in the underground blogesphere. You are helping to propel the art that is music in an honest and original way. That is some seriously extraordinary shit right there.   Thank you for reading...  ....... PS - About that Binary Star EP... juuust sayin...."
fantanoforever,23wcob,William_Cosby,33,Thu Apr 24 23:27:40 2014 UTC,"I love the hell out of radio. It's pretty much why I continued to do my radio show for years without making anything close to a living off of it, really. I went to broadcasting school, studied communications, worked at the campus radio station, and interned at a local NPR station as soon as I got out of college.   Yeah, it took a while. I wish my old radio demos were still online somewhere, cuz I sounded boring as hell. Had no idea how to just be myself in front of the camera, and express myself in a way that was captivating."
fantanoforever,23wcob,Kerfulfel,2,Thu Apr 24 23:35:43 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! The PBS station I worked at was also NPR/AP for on air. My tech work was mostly in television as you could imagine, but I used to love working in a place were while your working away you get to listen to something like Fresh Air or A Prairie Home Companion through the halls.   Can't wait for the next review. Have a good one! :)"

fantanoforever,23wcob,Aligator_Pacino,6,Thu Apr 24 23:20:35 2014 UTC,"Hey Anthony. Long time follower of yours here, just like to thank you for being my source for album reviews for the last two years.  Do you ever think about leaving Conneticut and doing something bigger elsewhere? Many youtubers are in LA, or New York has a better music scene. What keeps you in CT?  Have you ever had any offers to do a full radio show or something of that sort for larger broadcasters? Have you ever thought about that?  Lastly, a music question. What are your opinions on older people like Bob Dylan or David Bowie continuing to release new music? Do you think they should retire? Are they still relevant?"
fantanoforever,23wcob,jonald,21,Fri Apr 25 01:46:21 2014 UTC,"I used to dream about it, and the opportunity to do so actually came a few years ago. This guy was gonna throw me lots of cash, salary me to have me move to NYC and do what I do for his website. I turned him down cuz I'd rather keep it low key and be centered in CT for now. I have no plans to move to LA or NYC. I could see myself moving somewhere in the future, though.  I just like that I can do what I do and be a regular person. TND consumes my everyday life, and being over here makes it easy to sort of unplug from all of that when I need to. It would be a near impossible for me to do that in a place as bustling as NYC. Plus, I'd like to get a bigger place out here and build up a studio where I can shoot, record, edit more efficiently. I'm not a millionaire, and nobody is funding me, so it would be hard to do that in the big city on a budget. Also, I kinda like to keep things semi-DIY.  No, no offers on the radio show yet. If the opportunity comes, sure.  If they wanna release music, let 'em release it. Even if you don't like their new records, I think their continued activity keeps people going into their back catalogue, which is great!"

I can't say much about him or his music, but there's gotta be some dramatic, shady stuff going on since we've been waiting for a proper commercial release for SOOO LOOOOONG. or maybe he just doesn't give a fuck at the moment. not sure what his contract was, or how XL managed to pick him up, but he's obviously in no rush to get his album out there. there's obviously some kind of weird holdup going on--either that or the album is really taking his long to make!"
