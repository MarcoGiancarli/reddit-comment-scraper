RetroFuturism,3duh28,MyNameIsRobPaulson,21,Sun Jul 19 16:24:25 2015 UTC,"Thought I'd share my favorite retrofuturist, Hugh Ferriss.  I have a hard cover copy of his book ""The Metropolis of Tomorrow"".  Its incredible.    Excerpts from Wikipedia:  Hugh Ferriss (1889 â€“ 1962) was an American delineator (one who creates drawings and sketches of buildings) and architect. After his death a colleague said he 'influenced my generation of architects' more than any other man. Ferriss also influenced popular culture, for example Gotham City (the setting for Batman) and Kerry Conran's Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.  By 1920, Ferriss had begun to develop his own style, frequently presenting the building at night, lit up by spotlights, or in a fog, as if photographed with a soft focus. The shadows cast by and on, the building became almost as important as the revealed surfaces. He had somehow managed to develop a style that would elicit emotional responses from the viewer. His drawings were being regularly featured by such diverse publications as the Century Magazine, the Christian Science Monitor, Harper's Magazine, and Vanity Fair. His writings also began to appear in various publications.  In 1916, New York City had passed landmark zoning laws that regulated and limited the massing of buildings according to a formula. The reason was to counteract the tendency for buildings to occupy the whole of their lot and go straight up as far as was possible. Since many architects were not sure exactly what these laws meant for their designs, in 1922 the skyscraper architect Harvey Wiley Corbett commissioned Ferriss to draw a series of four step-by-step perspectives demonstrating the architectural consequences of the zoning law. These four drawings would later be used in his 1929 book The Metropolis of Tomorrow. This book illustrated many conte crayon sketches of tall buildings. Some of the sketches were theoretical studies of possible setback variations within the 1916 zoning laws. Some were renderings for other architect's skyscrapers. And at the end of the book was a sequence of views in Manhattan emerged in an almost Babylonian guise."""

It is very well written and you will understand what Ferris was doing in his work and what child of an era he was (yet he is not mentioned once).  A Gallery with impressions have I uploaded here  Also a Book - not sure if still available anymore - that is written in German called ""Idee und Anspruch der Architektur"" (Idea and entitlement of architecture).

RetroFuturism,3djied,qwarthon,5,Fri Jul 17 02:09:05 2015 UTC,"I'm starting to wonder if that Simpsons episode actually had a real impact on the political desire for monorail as a choice in transit planning.  Monorail obviously is flawed of course. As an inherently grade separated system any extensions will be costly, whereas light rail can operate comfortably at street level. But even worse is that the svelte beamways would invariably need safety catwalks, making their profile just as wide as a conventional heavy rail transit elevated guideways. As non standard infrastructure, it tends to be costly compared to off the shelf engineering. All these put together, it fits into a weird niche that competes mostly with heavy rail(metro or subway) but doesn't have the capacity."
RetroFuturism,3djied,jackwoww,2,Fri Jul 17 04:00:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe not a result, but in the recent past there was a group in Seattle to expand the monorail Unfortunately it was poorly managed and became defunct, but it was planned to work with the light rail agency (Sound Transit).   The monorail project proposed this buildout of the system. You can see where the Sound Transit Project currently is (Central Link). Unfortunately, when the agency went defunct, it left a major hole in our proposed transit network (the green line on the proposal map).  So Sound Transit is working to fill that void. Back in 2009, they passed Sound Transit 2, which funded the blue and red lines on this map.   Another expansion is coming up on the ballot called Sound Transit 3, which just got $15 billion in tax authority from the state, and which has the possibility to actually build the green line, along with many more improvements.  The current monorail in Seattle is fine as a tourist attraction, but actually building it out is not an option, and is a bed of false promises. Build Light Rail!"
