Granted if you add in postseason, then the gap between the top 3 gets narrower (and Montana jumps up 2 in the list):   Favre: 199-123 (.618) Peyton Manning: 190-90 (.679) Brady: 181-55 (.767) Elway: 162-90-1 (.642) Marino: 155-103 (.601) Montana: 133-54 (.711) Tarkenton: 130-114-6 (.532) Unitas: 124-66-4 (.649) Brees: 123-89 (.580) Bradshaw: 121-56 (.684)   I've bolded all players who have won more than 3 out of every 4 games.

Patriots,3e375r,Mom-spaghetti,65,Tue Jul 21 16:50:49 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the NFL would tamper with the results to make themselves look competent. They would probably measure after the balls have been sitting for a while instead of right after the balls come inside like they did with the pats.
Patriots,3e375r,Dsahld,19,Tue Jul 21 16:58:01 2015 UTC,This is exactly what they would do.
Patriots,3e375r,PatricksPub,2,Tue Jul 21 17:20:16 2015 UTC,"Or they could also just never publicize their findings of footballs losing air pressure. I'm sure espn would be on board, they already gargle up Goodells nuts as it is."
Patriots,3e375r,roboticbrady,4,Tue Jul 21 20:19:38 2015 UTC,It would be a combination of this or simply not reporting measurements and making sure the numbers never get out.
Patriots,3e375r,The_Jolly_Dog,22,Tue Jul 21 19:21:46 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately nothing would change/the NFL would never bring attention to it. The fact of the matter is that the NFL doesn't have to come out and say it - it has already been proven. A football subjected to cold/wet air (~15 to 20 degree temp drop) will decrease over 1 psi.   Even websites arguing that the pats ""clearly cheated"" show the math that the air could drop from 12.5psi to 11.5psi due to natural causes. (and then go on to say, ""but this doesn't explain the 2psi drop"" which has since been debunked)"
Patriots,3e375r,Jer_Cough,5,Tue Jul 21 17:39:41 2015 UTC,I want Bill and Bob to get really loud about it. They will no doubt be taking very accurate measurements this season.
Patriots,3e375r,spacecowboy007,4,Tue Jul 21 18:24:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, but keep in mind that the 1 psi drop was for a starting temperature of 70 degrees and a temperature equilibrium reached of 48 degrees.  What if they find out that normal prep and inflation in the equipment room causes the temperature in there to be more like 80 degrees? What if they find out that when the balls are then put into the ball bag (as they await transfer to the officials locker room for measurement) they retain that psi resulting from 80 degree air because the footballs are surrounded by other warm footballs inside a weatherproof ball bag? What if they find out that when the officials take the footballs out to measure, they do not allow enough time for the footballs to reach a temperature equilibrium with the 70 degree officials lockerroom......so that the psi being measured is actually a result of 80 degree air?  That 80 degree air would cause the footballs to lose 1.6psi once they reached a temperature equilibrium with 48 degree air.  The lowest psi registered at halftime was 10.5.  10.5 + 1.6 = 12.1.  Walt Andersons gauges had a difference in their readings of about .4psi.  12.1 + .4 = 12.5  They should really include tests which take these factors into account."
Patriots,3e375r,The_Jolly_Dog,3,Tue Jul 21 19:00:20 2015 UTC,"Right - but even outside of the NFL's own ineptitude, I think the problem with arguing over tenths of 1 psi in a football is just absurd. As you pointed to, there are just too many outside factors to bring into account.   If PSI is really as important to the integrity of the game as the masses think it is, then there needs to be heavy process improvements for managing equipment from the NFL - not throwing out garbage punishments for every ball at 12.4 psi."
Patriots,3e375r,Theungry,4,Tue Jul 21 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"That's why they will never start measuring PSI in every game.  Why would they put so much effort into it when they have nothing to gain, and only stand to lose credibility."
Patriots,3e375r,omglolitsjf,8,Tue Jul 21 18:11:03 2015 UTC,"Florio makes a good   I reflexively disagree with you.  Also, they know this is the case. The penalty was not strictly for underinflation."
Patriots,3e375r,omglolitsjf,4,Tue Jul 21 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"Haha I know what you mean, but he makes a seriously good point: At no point did the NFL care about or measure ball PSI. I don't think even the most rabid Pats haters would see a problem with postponing until they study ball PSI in an actual season.  I know they say the penalty was also for non-cooperation, but in reality it was for not admitting guilt. If it was actually for non-cooperation, Gostkowski would also be punished. I have a feeling you probably agree with me there."
Patriots,3e375r,djimbob,0,Tue Jul 21 17:15:08 2015 UTC,"Hardly. The penalty, on the surface, was for ball-tampering after the ref check. It really never mattered what the resulting PSI ended up being tested at.   I don't think even the most rabid Pats haters would see a problem with postponing until they study ball PSI in an actual season.   Of course they would. Conspiracy theories all the fuck over."
Patriots,3e375r,darkknightxda,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:18 2015 UTC,"But the only evidence of in-game Patriots ball tampering is the mid-game PSI levels, which are consistent with the ref's pre-game gauge (which tends to read high by ~0.4psi) and the expected pressure change from being outside at 50F instead of inside at ~72F.    A football that reads 12.5 psi at 72F (at 1 atm=13.7psi) will read 11.4 psi at 50F.  By the high gauge used at half-time (recollected to be used pre-game), the Patriots footballs read an average of 11.49 psi -- consistent with no tampering.  It seems ridiculous to penalize Brady or the Patriots for a ball attendant taking a 90 second bathroom break, unless there is clear evidence of tampering (not some vague text message referring to a ""deflator"" asking for free shoes in May after the 2013 offseason)."

If we had BJGE in there it would have been a 1 yard loss.  That said, I think Gray is serviceable, but nothing special. His performance in this game was mainly about our O-line. His lack of playing time after this game was because we picked up Blount, not because he was late to practice that one time."
Patriots,3e2o5n,ssnomar,3,Tue Jul 21 15:27:23 2015 UTC,"I think he did a good job recognizing the Colts' DE crashing in at the hole and made a nice stutter to set up the block. If we had BJGE in there it would have been a 1 yard loss.   That's not fair to BJGE and I don't think you're reading the play correctly.  This is a textbook misdirection play that was executed as scripted.  Jonas Gray didn't stutter step because he ""read"" the crashing end.  In a misdirection run you're coached to ALWAYS take that first stutter step to the opposite side of the where the run is going.  Notice at the start of the play Brady turns to his left with the ball in his right hand, indicating that the run is to the offensive left side or up the middle.  To sell the misdirection, Gray also takes a stutter step to the left.    However, at the last moment, Brady turns his body all the way and switches the ball from his right hand to his left hand (keep in that mind that since Brady's back is to the defense, his left hand is actually the offensive right side) for the handoff, while Gray takes the hand-off from Brady's right side (ie, the offensive right) after initially faking left.  ALL of this: Brady's ball-handling, his full turn, the switching of the ball from left hand to right hand, and Gray's initial stutter-step; it's all scripted in the play.  That's why Fleming doesn't panic when the RDE crashes the middle; he just washes him out by pushing #91 upfield past the running back, because he knows the run is going to the right all along.  Basically, there was a huge hole in the exact place the running back was supposed to go.  There's just no way BJGE (or anyone else really) would have taken a one yard loss on this run with the exception that he confuses the play-call and runs the wrong direction."
Patriots,3e2o5n,ishouldmakeanaccount,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not referring to his initial stutter step before taking the hand-off. Obviously that first step had nothing to do with the crashing end; he's making it before registering anything else. I am referring to his second stutter right at the hole which allowed Fleming to wash out the end. Right after he takes the hand-off, he makes a quick left-right then up the hole. If he just runs hard and straight he'll crash right into #91. This is why I referenced #91."

Patriots,3e2bry,Theungry,3,Tue Jul 21 14:17:04 2015 UTC,"That game broke my passion for football for the entire 2012 season. The Pats were dominating until the rent-a-refs manufactured an entire drive for the Ravens to get them back into the game. They called something like 4 or 5 bogus drive extending penalties once the Pats were up 13-0 on what should have been a Ravens 3 and out. This was the game where a Patriot linebacker got called for a 3rd down illegal contact on a play where he never even made ANY contact with a Ravens player.  My love of the game came back, but I've never been able to get as emotionally invested in NFL games since that day. I watch them and enjoy them a lot, but I don't really get too high or too low because it seems silly to care so deeply about a game that can be decided completely outside the efforts of the teams on the field.

Patriots,3dy9qi,stool_stirrer,43,Mon Jul 20 23:49:13 2015 UTC,"It was Vontae Davis, their best corner covering him."
Patriots,3dy9qi,thesandwitch,34,Mon Jul 20 14:55:57 2015 UTC,"So... here's what I see. The safety doesn't get over fast enough to help on the back side, which means the corner can't cheat underneath. That would probably be the best way to bust this play. Not saying the corner would have cut under the route necessarily, but the safety needs to be in position for Davis to be able to take that chance.  That being said: Brady probably doesn't make the throw if he sees the safety actually in position over top."
Patriots,3dy9qi,ctsmith76,17,Mon Jul 20 17:11:36 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer.  The safety is nowhere near fast enough to get over from his starting spot to cover LaFell, therefore not letting Davis jump the route and make a play on the ball. If the safety cheats over to LaFell's side pre-snap and Brady sees it, he's got a few options; he could send LaFell (or another receiver) on a go route, Gronk up the seam, , Vereen on a screen, etc.  The catch (no pun intended, but oh well) is, back shoulder throws are tough. When you hear about an elite quarterback being able to make ""all the throws"", this is one of the kinds they're talking about. Timing has to be perfect, a good, solid jam at the los throws this off. It's up to the receiver to shed any potential jam, get to his mark, jump, turn around, find the ball (should be at the shoulder, the one closest to the sideline) and catch it.   Remember Welker's drop in SB46? That was NOT a poor throw by Brady, Welker has to make that catch. The ball can maybe be 6"" lower, but Welker mis-times his turn; if he takes another half-step instead of trying to turn/backpedal, he doesn't stumble and he probably makes the catch. Vengeance for Super Bowl 42, and a fourth ring are in their grasp."
Patriots,3dy9qi,thesandwitch,5,Mon Jul 20 18:04:28 2015 UTC,"One thing I noticed about this play in-particular is that Lafell stutter steps twice, once at the LOS, and once just before he turns for the catch. At the LOS the purpose seemed to be in case there is a jam, it wouldn't mess up timing on the route. the second puts Lafell in perfect position for the catch, and lets Davis slightly overrun.    It's really a great route by Lafell, and of course the throw is right where it should be, when it should be."

Patriots,3dy9qi,ConciselyVerbose,4,Mon Jul 20 20:44:34 2015 UTC,"Edelman's a baller, though. I don't like Amendola in traffic, his durability, or his ability to hold the ball. He scares me."

Patriots,3dy9qi,fixyouregrammar,2,Mon Jul 20 17:04:29 2015 UTC,Missed this when I replied.
Patriots,3dy9qi,davdev,0,Mon Jul 20 17:41:11 2015 UTC,"That doesn't really cover it though, as it would be a different read and the route would change.  This play only happens on man coverage."
Patriots,3dy9qi,ClarkFable,3,Mon Jul 20 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"The question was how to defend it. The answer is some kind of zone defense. I agree that it would change the read, but that's true of any play.  As an alternative, you could get a pick off this by disguising the coverage and running a robber into that zone.  But you'd have to almost know it was coming."
Patriots,3dy9qi,fixyouregrammar,5,Mon Jul 20 19:48:17 2015 UTC,If you want the real answer you could run a zone underneath that route and have better success defending it.
Patriots,3dy9qi,davdev,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"If you want the real answer you could run a zone underneath that route and have better success defending it.   In which case the receiver has a different read, and the throw is never even made.  This play only succeeds when the receiver and qb read man coverage."
Patriots,3dy9qi,fixyouregrammar,5,Mon Jul 20 19:40:10 2015 UTC,"Well defending that throw can be seen as preventing it from taking place.   Against a bad QB who decides to thrown that ball, a zone D would defend it well."
Patriots,3dy9qi,nitram9,4,Mon Jul 20 19:45:45 2015 UTC,"You can't.  That's a back shoulder throw.  The only reason they don't throw that on every down is that it's really difficult to pull off.  It takes good timing, a real strong arm, accuracy and receiving skill.  If you get it right it's undefendable.  Most of the time though something goes wrong, you throw it a little late or early or a little too far outside or the receiver drops it or you really screw up and throw it too far inside right into the hands of the defender.  Actually, I shouldn't say it's impossible to defend.  It's easy to defend if the defender wants to take it away.  The problem is they can't defend every throw so they purposely leave the back shoulder open because it's by far the least dangerous throw to get beat on."
Patriots,3dy9qi,mrprpl,4,Tue Jul 21 00:04:54 2015 UTC,"Davis had safety help on the way, he could have stayed in front of LaFell and had a chance (I think) but instead he ran to LaFell's front like he was afraid of getting beat deep.  That said, well executed back shoulder throws are almost impossible to stop. One of the many reasons the NFL is a quarterback's league."
Patriots,3dy9qi,Orwick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:44:07 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's bad coverage route for the defense that being used. It almost looks like is unaware of having safety help, so he uses a coverage more geared for stopping yards after the catch."
Patriots,3dy9qi,zmundo,4,Tue Jul 21 08:59:53 2015 UTC,"If corners could make a little more contact and not get flagged for it, it would be easier for them to stop. But when they let defense play defense, Manning could never beat the Pat's."

Patriots,3dy9qi,Patriots4life89,3,Mon Jul 20 15:19:41 2015 UTC,"I loved getting lafell here. He's been what we were missing for a couple years. I hope we can get Reggie for cheap money and exhaust what he has left in the tank. To answer your question though, it's tough to defend this play but that defender who blew by lafell was supposed to stay UNDER, since there was a guy over the top. They had the right defensive play but could not defend it."

Were they responsible for making sure that the ball starting the game had enough room to allow the psi to drop and still be over 12.5? Hell no"
Patriots,3e3rhn,The_Jolly_Dog,3,Tue Jul 21 19:45:10 2015 UTC,"I think that's the perfect analogy, and it amazed me how many people didn't know that PSI drops in cold weather.  I don't think even the refs knew or none of this would have happened.  Doesn't anybody keep an eye on their tire pressure during winter anymore?"
Patriots,3e3rhn,Asshole_Salad,2,Tue Jul 21 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"I could swear I've heard John Madden mention it in the past.  He talked about it in relation to a final drive which required the team to get closer for a field goal because it was colder and footballs didn't go as far in colder weather.  I know people say that was because the air is denser, but I think he also made the point that the football loses some bounce back from the compression of the kick.....like a basketball which is left outside overnight during cold weather. When you pick it up and try to bounce it, it doesn't bounce as high."
Patriots,3e3rhn,spacecowboy007,4,Tue Jul 21 21:59:31 2015 UTC,"I would wager that almost no quarterbacks or equipment jockeys knew the Ideal Gas Law by name before Deflategate.  Hell, I spent two years using it in college chemistry class and yet only realized what they were talking about when I saw the equation.  PV=nRT stuck with me longer than the name, plus, well, college was a while ago.  But, I would wager that most people are at least generally aware that air pressure drops in cold weather.    This likely includes Aaron Rodgers, who's famously stated that he submits footballs overinflated.  Whether or not he knows the science (though he did win Jeopardy)  he's no doubt noticed that the balls are more squishy when he's outdoors on the frozen tundra.  So, adding up all the combined years of experience doesn't really mean anything.  Belichick, for one, doesn't care about air pressure in the football; that's left to the quarterback and his equipment guys."
Patriots,3e3rhn,venture70,2,Tue Jul 21 21:21:24 2015 UTC,Which really brings up an interesting point.....how is Green Bay going to fare this year with attention being paid to football psi?  Do you suppose GB submitted balls with excess psi during cold weather games to ensure Aaron Rodgers is playing with footballs he feels comfortable throwing?
Patriots,3e3rhn,spacecowboy007,0,Tue Jul 21 22:05:35 2015 UTC,"This is definitely plausible. As far as everything else, it's ridiculous  and I really at this point hope Brady and BB retire immediately and never speak of the nfl again.

Brady doesn't take as many chances downfield as other QB's because he's very risk adverse and frankly not all that accurate past 20 yards. A guy like Lloyd who can lay out for a ball and come down with it lets Bradyu throw away from the defender knowing the receiver is going to do the work to get it down. It's a good compliment to the crop of YAC receivers we've had the last five years, I hope he gets another Lloyd to round out the offense and make them a bit more dynamic."

Patriots,3e06rw,Andaroodle,14,Mon Jul 20 23:08:40 2015 UTC,He would be a role player. He would not start; I don't think he could overtake Lafell. He would be used on long thirds and against teams without a lot of depth at CB in spread formations.
Patriots,3e06rw,Koga52,3,Mon Jul 20 23:11:14 2015 UTC,I want to see Gibson in training camp first. He might end up being a good pickup.
Patriots,3e06rw,Kevin_Jim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:24:56 2015 UTC,I was just stating how they would use him if they signed/kept him into the regular season. I'm all for having the competition go out in training camp and preseason to see who the backups will be. I like the potential in our backups going into training camp.
Patriots,3e06rw,Koga52,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:42:24 2015 UTC,He's a surprise guy that could make the cut this year. A bigger bodied slot guy on the field with Gronk and Chandler in the red zone might be a great addition.
Patriots,3e06rw,2busy2blizzy,5,Tue Jul 21 11:58:21 2015 UTC,"Do you think he'll be a good fit?   No. There's a log jam at the position of guys who are better than him. He's what, #4 at best if he even makes the team? He'd be a pretty good depth guy if there was an injury but this team doesn't need more offense. He's effectively Deion Branch at the end."
Patriots,3e06rw,Sixchr,3,Tue Jul 21 00:52:32 2015 UTC,So for the vet minimum why not pick up good depth? Especially when he works the outside where we actually don't have good depth at all.
Patriots,3e06rw,CC333,3,Tue Jul 21 06:44:29 2015 UTC,"So for the vet minimum why not pick up good depth?   Because if the 53rd player on the roster is as important as the Patriots want us to believe then there's better options for that roster spot. On top of it all, I'm just not sure he's all that great anymore and I don't think he'd accept a lesser role. Not to mention he's soft as a grape."
Patriots,3e06rw,Sixchr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:59:24 2015 UTC,"Because if the 53rd player on the roster is as important as the Patriots want us to believe then there's better options for that roster spot.  He'd be a pretty good depth guy   Does WR depth not make him worth the 53rd spot? We have no one after our top 3 that is any good, and no one after Lafell that works the outside well."
Patriots,3e06rw,CC333,0,Tue Jul 21 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"On top of it all, I'm just not sure he's all that great anymore and I don't think he'd accept a lesser role. Not to mention he's soft as a grape."
Patriots,3e06rw,Sixchr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:21:34 2015 UTC,"Okay that is a legit reason for you to not want him, but it's not because 4th WR isn't important enough. Do you also really have confidence in Tyms and Dobson? Why not invite Wayne to training camp, you can always cut him."
Patriots,3e06rw,CC333,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:35 2015 UTC,"Do you also really have confidence in Tyms and Dobson?   No, I don't. But I think the Patriots have enough at the position to be ok. I would rather them devote any and all remaining resources to defense."
Patriots,3e06rw,Sixchr,4,Tue Jul 21 16:59:11 2015 UTC,I think he should a get camp invite at least. Kick the proverbial tires on him. If it looks like he's got anything left in the tank offer him the vet minimum or something like that. If it doesn't work out they can always cut him.
Patriots,3e06rw,ChazzyJoe,3,Tue Jul 21 02:17:43 2015 UTC,That seems to fit the patriot way mold. I think one thing that goes overlooked when picking up a vet WR is what they can teach young corners. I think Revis helped JE11 a lot this year with shedding coverage.
Patriots,3e06rw,SuperEdel,2,Tue Jul 21 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"I gotta be honest, Wayne was still a solid possession receiver until he got hurt last year, idk if vet minimum will be enough to land him. I think he's still good for 40-50 receptions a year. Last year he had 64/779 in 15 games, and in 2012 he hit *106/1355. I doubt he still has those prime-Wayne numbers in him 3 years later, but he always relied on his route running and he can still run em'."
Patriots,3e06rw,ChazzyJoe,2,Tue Jul 21 08:20:25 2015 UTC,"Very fair, but coming off an injury I don't know what sort of leverage he/his agent have to demand higher numbers. And I don't know how many teams besides the Patriots would take a flyer on a 36/37 year-old coming off two less-than-stellar, and one injury-shortened, seasons."
Patriots,3e06rw,SuperEdel,2,Tue Jul 21 14:05:28 2015 UTC,We could pick his brain for tips on how to finally beat those pesky Colts.
Patriots,3e06rw,tundrawolf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:13:44 2015 UTC,I don't think we need his advice on that.

Patriots,3e06rw,SuperEdel,3,Tue Jul 21 03:29:19 2015 UTC,"I was pretty surprised when I looked at his stats. I was remembering him fighting a nagging injury last year for several games, but he still put up 64/779 over 15 games. Not bad for anyone, let alone a 35 year old dude. He put up 106/1335 at 33 years old, I don't think the man is washed up just yet."
Patriots,3e06rw,DarrelleRevis24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:27:31 2015 UTC,"I think he could work out for us at the #4 spot, mostly because I think there's a possibility we will be playing a lot of shotgun or just generally because we don't have as good of a receiving HB as we did last year.  Vereen was 4th in receiving yards last year.  We now have 2 pretty solid TEs, I see us using a power run game and possibly a spread passing game in shotgun which could mean a good #4 WR could be good for us this year."
Patriots,3e06rw,hYPE26,2,Tue Jul 21 03:33:47 2015 UTC,"Edelman, LaFell, Amendola, Wayne, Gibson   That'd be cool.   Dobson this is your time. Make it or break it!  Tyms is nice to hang onto as well though seeing as how he and Jimmy G had a good connection in preseason last year.   Question with Wayne is.. How much does he want? Would he be ok being the #4 #5 guy  Obviously Tyms and Dobson have a higher ceiling..but they gotta start proving it....otherwise...they could very well release one of them and make room for Wayne"
Patriots,3e06rw,Swayz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:41:32 2015 UTC,Bring him in see if he still has gas in the tank. He's old and this is a young mans game
Patriots,3e06rw,handheldcoma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:11:11 2015 UTC,"Seeing as we won the SB without him or someone like him, I'd rather have tyms and Dobson with a upswing to their career. That being said if it's vet minimum and he can teach others in training camp sure."
Patriots,3e06rw,MasterofMarionettes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:31:45 2015 UTC,If we sign him its a check to see what he has left.  Best case he's a solid #3 and splits time there w/ Dola.  Worst case a Tory Holt or David Patten part 2 for us.  If he is not good enough to beat Dobson/Harper/Gibson/whoever else then he's a guy you give an emergency call if injuries happen
Patriots,3e06rw,Ferrrrrrrrrrrrrrrari,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:15 2015 UTC,I think he deserves to play for a real NFL team before he retires. I'd love to have him on board

Patriots,3dxq38,ElGuaco,40,Mon Jul 20 12:11:27 2015 UTC,"People believe Goodell did Kraft a favor in destroying the spygate tapes. Becuase most people don't know what actually happened.  I posted this previously:  Most people don't know that the issue wasn't WHAT they were filming is was WHERE they were filming from.   See, most articles were presented like this, ""NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has determined that the New England Patriots violated league rules Sunday when they videotaped defensive signals by the New York Jets' coaches, according to league sources.""..BTW, guess who authored this article...I bet you can't....  This article makes it sound like the issue was stealing/recording signals; when the real issue was WHERE they were filming from.  ""The issue is not stealing signals. That is allowed, “and it is done quite widely,” Commissioner Roger Goodell said recently.""  The rule is: “No video recording devices of any kind are permitted to be in use in the coaches’ booth, on the field, or in the locker room during the game,” the league’s Game Operations Manual reads.  Had Belichick recorded the signals from one of the approved locations...its a non-issue and completely legal.   Likewise, people think only goodell saw the tapes and then destroyed them to cover for the patriots. They don't know that a bunch of reporters have seen them too.   Additionally, many people still believe that the patriots taped the Rams practices/walkthrough prior to their superbowl win 2001. The Boston Herald ran with a story about a Matt Walsh (a ex-employee) who said he had tapes of Patriots filming walkthroughs. Becuase spygate had just happened, (and the patriots were absolutely hated at that point); they wanted to believe. Then Ex-rams players get on TV and are like, ""Man, it was like they knew our plays...."" People wanted to believe. That explains why they were so good back then...why 14 point underdogs beat the ""greatest show on turf.""  They ignore the fact that the Boston Herald had to run a retraction and that even after being given immunity, Matt Walsh had nothing. People just ignored the outcome, they didn't care, the first headline was all that mattered...patriots cheated....OR, they just assumed Goodell swept it under the rug again.   It's easier to believe the patriots are cheaters, than the alternative...which is that Belichick, Kraft and Brady are that much better than everyone else. You aren't supposed to be able to cut guys like seymour, samuel, law, milloy, mankins, welker, moss, etc...and still be really fricking good. The patriots have played in (what?) 6 of the last 15 superbowls..they've been in (I think) 9 of 15 AFCCGs. While most teams struggle to make the playoffs 50% of the time...the patriots are in the AFFCG 60% of the time, and the superbowl 40% of the time.   On the flip side, Kraft has publicly supported Goodell through things like the Ray rice incident (and other incidents). Kraft is also on the committee that gave out Goodell's most recent contract (it's like 6-7 years and worth $300 million). It's easy to assume there is a little I'll scratch your back, if you scratch mine."
Patriots,3dxq38,genuine_magnetbox,9,Mon Jul 20 13:18:04 2015 UTC,Kraft being buddies with Goodell would not appear to have helped us in any way as near as I can tell.

They don't know that a bunch of reporters have seen them too.   Or, to come at it another way, the tapes were destroyed for the good of the NFL.  Since any further scrutiny of the issue, on the whole, would've opened up a can of worms, thereby & ultimately implicating more teams than it would not.  So, really, a potential issue; but one no one's really yet prepared to deal with so directly"
Patriots,3dxq38,AmericanFartBully,29,Tue Jul 21 02:54:57 2015 UTC,"I was going to say exactly this. Spygate? Largest fine in history and first round draft pick lost. Deflate gate? Larger fine, 1st and 4th rounder lost, QB suspended. Our players get caught doing PEDs, they get suspended like everyone else (see Harrison, Rodney).   Other teams get caught pumping in crowd noise and heating footballs on sidelines and they get warnings/lighter fines and later round draft picks lost. Seems like the opposite of preferential treatment to me."

Patriots,3dxq38,jotch,6,Mon Jul 20 14:12:26 2015 UTC,"This is pretty easy - there's a string of incidents in which perception has been manipulated (as it always is) in various directions, and yet the final math falls onto the side of 'unfair' advantages for us.  Sure, Spygate, but even things like the Tuck Rule - that was the beginning of people thinking that we didn't deserve success... we should have been out during the Tuck game, and therefore every single playoff win after that has an asterisk, like a baseball pitcher suffering an error with two outs - all the other runs can be unearned.  The fact that the NFL is one of the biggest shows on earth, the fact that fans get so fired up, the fact that ESPN is overtly in bed with the league... it all means that every mole-hill can be a mountain."
Patriots,3dxq38,hipcheck23,5,Mon Jul 20 14:58:27 2015 UTC,"Anyone who  believes we have received favorable treatment isn't paying attention.

Let's keep them lying around so that they can get leaked and provide others an unfair advantage as well.""  The only logical thing to do with those tapes was to destroy them.  Why would the NFL leave them lying around for anyone to get their hands on?  If it provided such a steep, unfair advantage, then risking them getting leaked would be horrifically irresponsible.  If the tapes didn't provide any competitive advantage, then the punishment looks egregious compared to the crime.  You can't have it both ways."
Patriots,3dxq38,QuagMeyer6791,10,Mon Jul 20 14:36:16 2015 UTC,The tapes were shown publicly to reporters before being destroyed. Some speculation has been around recently that the biggest reason they weren't publicly available was that they involved a lot of focus on cheerleaders and other women by the dope working the camera.
Patriots,3dxq38,Theungry,5,Mon Jul 20 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"The funny part is NOT destroying the tapes would have been beneficial to the Pats and the rest of the league. It could've been used as a reference for teams so they know what not to do, because the wording of the rulebook seemed pretty convoluted at the time."
Patriots,3dxq38,HarryButters,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:09:45 2015 UTC,"that argument is totally absurd. He destroyed them AFTER he proclaimed us guilty. Revealing the tapes couldn't possibly make us MORE guilty. The only two things revealing the tapes could have done is show it wasn't as bad as he was suggesting, or absolutely nothing."

Spygate was one of the biggest penalties ever (I think biggest fine at the time + a first?), and now deflategate - I can't think of any scandal that got swept under the rug or received a slap on the wrist.  Is there any actual incident of penalties smaller than what the perceived punishment should be, or are people just making shit up based off of Kraft's relationship?"
Patriots,3dxq38,rska884,11,Mon Jul 20 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"Well the perceived punishment for Spygate and Deflategate according to most NFL fans should have been Brady and Belichick permanently removed from the NFL, all SuperBowl titles vacated and the Patriots team to be disbanded, so I guess in that case we've gotten preferential treatment.  According to how the real world works, though? We've gotten hit equally or worse than any other team bar perhaps the Saints for Bountygate, and even then they had players (maybe) getting paid to try and injure other players (allegedly) and their coach ignored previous warnings (according to the NFL)."

Patriots,3dxq38,rska884,11,Mon Jul 20 15:07:34 2015 UTC,"I fully expect Goodell to stick to his 4 game ban, seeing as how he is oblivious to common sense and basic public sentiment vis a vis domestic violence and ""he was generally aware that something may have happened"".

Patriots,3dxq38,kingletas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:26 2015 UTC,I am hoping that Goodell either complete lifts the penalties on Brady or educes it to 3 games.
Patriots,3dxq38,par016,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:12 2015 UTC,"I do not agree with this analysis. There is no need to talk of deafness, instigation, strategy or fairness. Of course Goodell can try to end this debacle by reducing the suspension and avoid further confrontation, but this also means that Goodell, his staff and by extension the league have no integrity, the very thing they wanted to protect.  This has been one of the most important and public investigations during Goodell's reign as commisioner and the NFL spent several millions and months on the issue before rendering a verdict. Did Goodell not do due diligence and consider all the appropriate facts and factors? Did he not make sure that his subordinates did their job propperly? And isn't he the head of the organization anyways, so the blame for any mistake fall squarely on his shoulders? How then at the end of all this can Goodell tell us with a straight face that the conclusion his staff made was the wrong one?  Keeping the suspension at 4 games is the only way Goodell can maintain that they are acting in the interest of integrity. Anything else exposes that he and his staff have none."

I was worried that we would cut him or Tyms but they both earned a well deserved roster spot. White could be the real deal and if so, having Wayne in as a veteran even in camp would be a worthy contribution. I feel if anyone were to go it could possibly be Dobson, considering his work ethic, he may not make it out of camp if there isn't much improvement over the last seasons."

The way our roster is laid out, I really don't see where he fits.  He is, at best, a WR4 on this team and to win a roster spot, we'd need to cut guys like Brandon Gibson, Aaron Dobson, Brian Tyms, Josh Boyce, etc.  Wayne is running on empty at this stage in his career and I just don't see it happening."

Patriots,3dzu1v,VictorCast12,18,Mon Jul 20 21:33:23 2015 UTC,"Offensive side of the ball  I have a lot more faith in our receiving group this year than in 2013. Gronk has had an off season to improve rather than recover for the first time in like 3 years, going into 2013 Edelman was a huge question mark because of how little he played and how often he was injured, Amendola was new to the offense and injured in 2013 whereas he seemed to finally be finding his role in the offense  during our playoff run which is promising for our #4 option, Lafell really started shining as our #3 receiving option as the season progressed. Lafell is a lot better than Thompkins as much as I loved  him after that 2013 Saints game. We also look to be adding Red Zone scoring potential with Chandler who is a big athletic veteran who I'm excited to see in 2 TE sets.  Our rushing attack is a giant question mark. Imho Ridley was far and away our most talented back much better than Blount, I think we will have an effective RBBC this year either way and I'm excited to see if Shaq Mason can crack the starting lineup at guard or move Stork to LG and have Mason at center. I really believe Mason can bring an intensity to our Oline that hasn't been there since Mankins left.   Oline looks to improve from last year with Solder recovering from cancer, Vollmer having a solid year after his broken leg and Stork looking promising. I'm worried about our starting guards but it seems Cannon may be able to fill in and we have what seem to be promising draftees this year. It will be interesting to see what direction our line goes in Deguglielmo's second year replacing Scarnecchia. We may be worse here than in 2013 which is not a good sign because our 2013 oline really wasn't that great.  I am still in denial that we are being punished for something so stupid. I will not believe Brady will miss games until I see it. With that being said I believe that Brady will absolutely go off this year. He has been working on his mobility still which may even be better than last year when he had multiple clutch runs, he has the same core receivers in place from the year before for the first time since like 2010, he is also more motivated than he has ever been. This is a guy who lives with a chip on his shoulder. All off season people having been calling him a cheater, saying he doesn't deserve his SB win, saying he doesn't deserve to be in the HoF, saying he doesn't deserve to play in this league and that has him fired up. I think we see a more focused and relentless Brady than we have ever seen. This season it's personal. I'm projecting that over 16 games he throws 4500-5000 yards, 40-50 TDs, 3-8 ints, and wins league + SB MVP. This may be the best we ever see Brady perform.  Defensive side of the ball  LBs are much better. Hightower and Collins are veterans now and are on their way to becoming household names and we will have Mayo back to be the QB of our defense. This is a very solid grouping, much better than Mayo, a 2nd year Hightower, rookie Collins and lazy Spikes.  Dline- Before injuries our 2013 Dline looked great, Tommy Kelly was a beast and Wilfork was a little younger and hadnt had his injury yet, as the year wore on our line kinda turned to shit. This year our dline is a huge question mark. We have for the last two years drafted Dlinemen in the first round, Easley was considered a top-5 to top 10 prospect before he got hurt and Brown is known as one of the biggest steals of this years draft. Easley had a ridiculous first step in college if he can rehab all the way and get back to form he can be a major improvement to our interior rushing abilities. Brown by all reports has been a beast in practice and looks to be a day 1 starter if he can meet expectations along with Easley our Dline can become a strength of the defense like we havent seen in many years. They could also suck.   DE's I'm excited for Sheard and Flowers to enter our rotation, they will give nink and Chandler a rest and will help us stay versatile and create mismatches when we want them. Everyone is still waiting on Chandler to break out but who knows if that will ever happen overall I'm more excited about this DE core than I was in 2013  Safeties should look to improve, I actually really like Harmon, he isn't a star player but he is almost always in the right position and rarely gets beat, Dmac is Dmac, Chung being back gives us versatility, he is better than Gregory was as an in the box safety  CBs are definitely taking a hit. We have no proven talent on the roster that can compete with #1's. We are very likely to regress from our 2012-2014 backfields but this might not be too important of a factor as long as they can compete and our safeties play disciplined football. If we can finally get an interior rushing attack going with Easley and Brown we may be able to successfully drop more players into coverage more often or they may not have to cover receivers all that long.  Special Teams we always kick ass, we still have the best gunner in the game in Slater and Bolden has been proving himself a force in special teams as well. Also Resigning Ghost gives us one of the best kickers of all time, Ryan Allen is a solid punter and will not have to worry about sorry ass long snaps now that we have Cardona snapping like a boss. Also Edelman is one of the best punt returners of all time.   Overall we will have to see how the season plays out with suspensions and injuries but we have a great mix of veterans and young promising talent to make this one of the best rosters we have had in years.  Holy fuck! Sorry for the wall of text guys I got carried away"
Patriots,3dzu1v,broner4brady,5,Mon Jul 20 22:45:10 2015 UTC,That was a fucking epic breakdown. Well done. You really know this team.
Patriots,3dzu1v,CubbyHurlihee,3,Tue Jul 21 00:30:17 2015 UTC,"Great post. But I don't think Stork will be moved to Guard. Tre' Jackson will probably mind the LG. We also have David Andrews to backup the C position and Wendel/Shaq at RG.  Best case scenario: we go all in on OL and sign Mathis. Then you have Solder/Fleming(?), Mathis/Jackson/Kline, Stork, Wendell/Jackson/Shaq, Vollmer/Fleming/Cannon. That's a good OL.  If White can step up, our running game will probably be productive."
Patriots,3dzu1v,Kevin_Jim,2,Tue Jul 21 04:19:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't necessarily see Stork moving either because he really did show promise at center last year so why shake it up. Best case  scenario is that Jackson can win the starting role at LG and Mason can win the starting role at RG. I am just afraid that Mason may not be tall enough for the position. I am in love with his game film. It seems like every run play he makes it his job to drive a defender 5-10 yards back and put them on their ass. If those guys can step up though we could have a solid interior line for the next 3-4 years. Vollmer is on his way out after next season is my guess but Flemming or Cannon should be able to step up.   Our Vereen replacement is a concern but between white and cadet someone should be able to fill in adequately. They might even be able to catch a wheel route which Vereen hasn't been able to do since he broke his wrist two years ago. I'm not too concerned though. Vereen was an unknown stepping in for woodhead and he did great. I expect another unknown to step in for Vereen without too many troubles. Our offense makes it pretty easy to get production out of a pass catching back.
Patriots,3dzu1v,broner4brady,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:34:32 2015 UTC,"Great write up, but I have 2 things:   Cannon is probably our last option at guard, he's had his opportunities across a couple seasons now and failed every time. He's a decent tackle but a terrible guard. The competition is between Wendell, Fleming, Kline, and the rookies.  Spikes absolutely was not lazy in 2013, he was a fucking beast. Our run defense would have been even worse than it was without him (that's seriously saying something). He played hurt pretty much all year and he was banging inside on 330 pounds guards every single game. Spike stepped up big time in 2013,calling him lazy is a real disservice."
Patriots,3dzu1v,2busy2blizzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:55:51 2015 UTC,"I know Cannon projects more to the tackle position but I guess I'm just hoping we can get something out of a contract I don't feel he deserves. I don't think any of our options at guard are proven. Wendell got put on his ass one too many times last year that I don't want to see him in. Kline is not starting quality. Fuck Devey.   And Spikes has always played the run well but if memory serves me correctly he was held out of a couple playoff games for attitude/tardiness/laziness even if those things were only in practice. I can't remember exactly what it was for only that 2013 was the season that we had a ridiculous amount of injuries. Front seven lost wilfork, Kelly, armstead, and mayo which severely hurt our run stopping abilities. That Spikes wasn't wanted in the lineup during the playoffs during one of our most injured seasons has always left him with a bad taste in my mouth. You are right that he is a force in run support"
Patriots,3dzu1v,broner4brady,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:15 2015 UTC,"Collins emerging allowed Bill to put Spikes on IR before the playoffs. He wasn't just sitting. Spikes' best year here was probably 2013, and it seems like you're putting attitude and laziness together as one thing. It isn't. Spikes was wild and kinda irresponsible at times but his work ethic was never in question afaik.  Canon doesn't really ""project"" as anything anymore, he got that contract to play as our backup tackle which he has had success at. BB more than likely has him slated as Vollmer's replacement once his contract is up.  As for Kline, he's coming up exactly the same way the SB winning, team captain, Dan Connolly did. I wouldn't rule him out at all. The Patriots are great at developing interior linemen especially with the patience aspect of things. Wendell had a perfectly fine season last year too he didn't get ""knocked on his ass"" any more than the rest of the interior guys. His only problem is that r/patriots still thinks he's an awful lineman because of his mediocre 2013 season. I'm not very worried if he stays at right guard at all."
Patriots,3dzu1v,2busy2blizzy,9,Tue Jul 21 15:39:07 2015 UTC,Secondary worse without a shutdown corner in Talib. Dline probably better. LB group better. Patriots offence? No question better since it was severely weakened without Gronk. Brady was throwing deep to Collie and Slater in the AFC Championship game. Just wasn't going to work. And Dobson/Thompkins saw a lot of playtime throughout the year as they went through growing pains.
Patriots,3dzu1v,TheMagicianDolph,4,Mon Jul 20 22:07:37 2015 UTC,Probably better. Our LB and DE core is better than 2013.  Was our 2013 team a more zone-oriented scheme?
Patriots,3dzu1v,FahrenheitZero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:38:40 2015 UTC,"As usual, we were game oriented, but we did play press man with Talib. This year it'll probably be mostly zone and if Butler steps up big time, he could man the other teams' 1st WR.  Unlikely but I look forward to his development."
Patriots,3dzu1v,Kevin_Jim,2,Tue Jul 21 04:23:45 2015 UTC,"I'd say our secondary is worse, since we won't have Talib, who for the first 6 games of 2013 was elite. The biggest difference is that we have a completely healthy Gronk and a deeper d-line and linebacker group."
Patriots,3dzu1v,Coldmode,2,Mon Jul 20 21:44:57 2015 UTC,"Well for one thing, 1/3 of the roster isn't in IR right now, so we have that going for us!"
Patriots,3dzu1v,Stfuppercut,2,Tue Jul 21 11:51:01 2015 UTC,"For one I think we are a deeper team this year. And thats saying something because despite all the injuries in 2013 we still made the AFC championship and were in it til Talib went down.  To continue on that point, things looked pretty bleak in 2013 after Gronk went down. If he goes down this year than we still have a solid pass catching TE in Chandler. Now, Chandler is nowhere near as good as Gronk, but we wouldn't have to basically remove TEs from the receiving playbook if Gronk goes down again. Sheard gives us great depth for Chandler and Nink, and Grissom Flowers, Dickson looks like a solid competition for the other spots. DT is pretty deep since Siliga and Branch and Jones are all solid in their respective ways (Jones being the least solid), and with Moore looking to move inside, and Brown and Easly there in the wings I see this group being decent.  In 2013 we didnt have a great WR group. Edelman was awesome, and Amendola was decent but he was fighting off injury all year. Lafell in particular offers something our offense needed for years in a solid perimeter receiver. Seems like every catch he gets brings us a first down. Had he been around in 2013 we likely have a better shot in the AFC game. Not to mention that Amendola seems more comfortable after a monster postseason, and between Gibson and Dobson I think one of them will be a solid #4 receiver, and by solid I mean capable of becoming our #3 WR if somebody goes down and y'know, catching a ball.  LB is a big strength assuming Hightower and Mayo dont completely suck post injury. Collins is a beast, and with Wells and Fletcher we have solid depth, and will often only have 2 LB on the field anyway.  Safety is an underrated strength. From the way BB drafts in the 2nd and how we used Chung its clear that BB loves to have a hybrid LB/safety ""money"" guy who can cover and defend the run. I actually like the Richards pick and between him and Chung, and aforementioned smaller linebackers in Wells and Fletcher I think we have that spot down, and at FS Dmac is elite and Harmon is underrated and very solid imo. If it weren't for how damn good Chung is against the run then Harmon would never leave the field, as hes a good tackler, but with how strong Chung is there I have no issue with them both getting good snaps and staying fresh. I do expect more snaps from Harmon this year.  CB is a big question mark, but I personally think Butler and Ryan, along with Fletcher and McClain can be ok. I actually think Roberts is a big steal and I think he offers the most promise from our draftees along with Brown and Jackson. I see this being a weakness, but not a huge one. Probably equal or a bit worse than 2013 since in 2013 Talib and Dennard both played good football.  At Oline I think Wendell stays at RG, while Jackson plays LG and Stork plays the middle. If Mason can pan out and share snaps with Wendell then we should be ok, as Fleming and Cannon offer great depth for Solder and Vollmer. Last year the line relied on Bradys speed at getting the ball out, but if they can improve somewhat, then our offense will be even better (though they were #1 for much of last year), particularly if they can give Blount that first step he needs to gain momentum. Imagine that for a moment.  At RB I think Blount and Gray can be solid, though I am hoping Gaffney steals a backup spot, and between Cadet and White I think we'll get some production out of that position in the receiving game. Their success will be tied to how the oline performs.  Special teams looks to remain stellar, especially since as someone pointed out we should hopefully have a better LS which will help Allen.  To sum it all up, lets look at a potential starting lineup were we to suffer 2013 levels of injuries (just for fun):  QB: Brady LT:Solder LG:Jackson C:Stork/Wendell RG:Mason/Kline RT:Cannon TE1:Chandler TE2:Hooman WR1:Edelman WR2:Lafell RB:Gray/Cadet  LDE:Nink RDE:Sheard DT:Branch DT:Brown LB:Collins LB: Dane Fletcher CB1:Ryan cb2:Fletcher SS:Chung FS:Harmon  So I just showed an imaginary depth chart thats lost Gronk, Vollmer, Amendola, Blount, Chandler Jones, Siliga, Hightower, Mayo, Butler, and Dmac to IR (does it sound like 2013 yet?) and you know what, that looks like a roster that could at least compete with pretty much any team, even if victory would be uncertain, and we would surely have a lot of yards thrown on us. Lafell and Chandler give us great TE and WR depth. Hell, a lot of those spots would still have another backup to share snaps, as I didnt list Gibson/Dobson, Flowers, Chris Jones, Zach Moore, and a slew of other guys.  So yea this team looks stronger than 2013, though that doesnt mean we'll make it as far. We could field a better team and go home in the first round, or even miss the playoffs.. That 2013 team was a testament to what determination and good coaching can do."

But lets be honest, at some point we need to, and we will wait until hes throwing pick 6's every game before we ask for him to step down.

And I want to be in a similar situation as Greenbay, where the dude on the bench is so good we can justify moving on. The problem is that Brady is a 4x Super Bowl, future HOF QB. There's never going to be a guy that can top that from riding the bench. There's no way a QB like that hits FA in his prime, especially at a Patriots salary. So, yeah, I want Garoppolo to be so good that we legitimately question leaving Brady in. That's a great problem to have."

Patriots,3e0y82,ScreamPunch,2,Tue Jul 21 12:26:49 2015 UTC,"You cannot replace Darrelle Revis. Let alone with Byron Maxwell, who's a fine #2 corner at best. Byron Maxwell has been way overrated because he played in that insane Seattle defense and was surrounded by elite/very good players.  The only way the secondary would have remained similar to last year is if they were able to acquire a guy like Patrick Peterson, Richard Sherman, Joe Haden, etc which was 150% unrealistic. Or, you know, just paying Darrelle Revis."

Patriots,3duspt,RankInsubordination,22,Sun Jul 19 18:26:47 2015 UTC,"What is the issue? Vet min deal, for sure would bring him in.  creates competition and pushes Dobson/Tyms that much more. If Dobson does not take the expected step, he is not making this team. I dont expect anything from Tyms, great story but not counting on him just like I said about KT a year ago.  and if you find out in camp that Wayne could provide 20 snaps or so a game in certain spread packages, give him the #4 role unless Dobson proves he is ready to take a step.  No harm in bringing him in for camp, letting him try and at the very least rub off on the younger guys and allow them to EARN a spot rather than being given it to them.  Oh, and some pictures of Wayne in a pats uniform wouldn't come close to making up for deflategate but sure would piss off some colts fans and that organization. I am always down with getting under their skin"
Patriots,3duspt,Barustai,8,Sun Jul 19 18:39:27 2015 UTC,"Wayne wouldnt sign for vet min.  If Wayne is on the roster week 1, his entire salary is guaranteed. More likely he gets called after week 1.  He doesnt play on special teams.  We really need Dobson, Gibson, or Tyms to contribute.  Im not sure how excited he would be about just being a camp mentor."

Patriots,3dzak2,2busy2blizzy,7,Mon Jul 20 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"I personally think there is a slim to none chance Brady misses a single game this season because the likely is he takes the NFL to court and gets an injunction postponing punishment.   But if we had to start Garoppolo I see 2-2. Im sorry I just dont see the hype train, I think Bradys ability makes the offense and we dont have a run game to protect Garoppolo."
Patriots,3dzak2,SpecOpBeevee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:17:20 2015 UTC,I don't necessarily agree but his rationale was the BB is going to rise to the challenge in a big way. That he's going to take the challenge of showing the league Brady didn't make him and to give a big fuck you to the league. (Which I do agree with)
Patriots,3dzak2,SpecOpBeevee,3,Mon Jul 20 19:20:13 2015 UTC,"Brady and Belichick made each other, but I think coaching is more important for defense and pure talent is what shines through on Offense....   Belichick gives brady consistency, but Brady is what makes this team a championship team ..."
Patriots,3dzak2,SpecOpBeevee,-1,Mon Jul 20 19:29:40 2015 UTC,That's a terrible take regarding coaching offense. They both take an extreme  amount of coaching to maximize whatever natural talent is there. Something BB does every year on all three phases.
Patriots,3dzak2,YardGoats,5,Mon Jul 20 19:34:03 2015 UTC,I doubt we have 4 championships without tb12
Patriots,3dzak2,TheMagicianDolph,0,Mon Jul 20 19:59:44 2015 UTC,"That has absolutely nothing to do with your statement that the offense requires less coaching because its all about pure talent.   I'd obviously agree with that statement, however, what I was talking about (and you were too up until a minute ago) is that the offense requires just as much coaching as the defense. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills if people agree with you on that."
Patriots,3dzak2,TheProper,-2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"That and the fact that we have a perfect example of how BB did without brady Ie. Matt Cassel, who hasnt seemed to be able to have the same success anywhere else."
Patriots,3dzak2,ctpatsfan77,3,Mon Jul 20 19:40:17 2015 UTC,He had the best year if his life as a chief where the team was all his. Made the probowl and a wild card appearance.
Patriots,3dzak2,TheMagicianDolph,3,Mon Jul 20 22:11:38 2015 UTC,"Hate this argument because it's simply not true. Cassel took an essentially unchanged roster that went 16-0 against the 2nd hardest SOS in 2007 (would have been 1st if the Pats had lost a single game ironically) to a 11-5 record against the 31st hardest SOS in the league. 5 game dropoff from the hardest schedule to the easiest schedule. That means, in the absolute best case scenario where everything is aligned for his replacement, Brady was worth 5 wins. If the team had faced a similar schedule in 2008 that they did in 2007, they would have gone 8-8 with an outrageously talented roster and no one would point to 11-5 as some mystical accomplishment.  BB is 51-65 without Brady as his QB. That is over 7 full NFL seasons and not a small sample size. The 2008 Patriots under Cassel myth needs to die. Belichick is quite possibly THE greatest coach of all time but you don't get over Brady's loss easily. I would be ecstatic if we went 2-2 should Brady's suspension be upheld and unchallenged."
Patriots,3dzak2,kapachow,3,Mon Jul 20 19:52:53 2015 UTC,"That means, in the absolute best case scenario where everything is aligned for his replacement, Brady was worth 5 wins.   Cassel is a unique case in the history of the NFL; he is literally the only player ever to start a game at QB in the NFL who never started at QB in college. Yes, they would have done better with Brady, but I doubt that most coaches would have been able to go 11–5 with Cassel + that team."
Patriots,3dzak2,SpecOpBeevee,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:43 2015 UTC,Cassel also had a fantastic year in which he made the pro bowl with a playoff appearance. Made himself look like a long term starter.
Patriots,3dzak2,kapachow,-5,Mon Jul 20 22:10:23 2015 UTC,"Yea. 2-2 for sure.

Patriots,3dzak2,Nickyq52,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"I agree, because Brady won't miss a game"
Patriots,3e0h4t,fierruda,10,Tue Jul 21 00:32:14 2015 UTC,"Nope. Several reasons   As good as Wayne was, he was never Moss More on the previous point, Wayne does not have the top end speed Moss had. Moss remains the only TRUE deep threat Brady has ever had.  Moss was 30 when he signed. Wayne would be 37 Moss had a several jars of pickles throwing to him in 2006, Kerry Collins in 2005 and managed 1000yds with him. Wayne had Andrew Luck throwing to him who is even better for WR stats than Brady based on volume alone.   That said, I wouldn't be surprised if he could fit in nicely and be a good contributor."
Patriots,3e0h4t,CNDNFighter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:18 2015 UTC,He was on course for 1000 last year before he got injured/
Patriots,3e0h4t,kksred,8,Tue Jul 21 00:37:44 2015 UTC,"Fine but let's look at the facts   a roughly 1100yd, 5TD pace is not the ~1500yd, 23TDs Moss gave us in 2007 or even the ~1250yd 13TD from 2009 (with a still recovering Brady) Reggie Wayne is another year older Reggie Wayne is coming off of injury Reggie Wayne is no longer a deep threat   Now the point that is a little more abstract not so much fact   Those stats are likely to decline playing in an O with Edelman, Gronk and LaFell and no Luck."
Patriots,3e0h4t,CNDNFighter,4,Tue Jul 21 00:41:36 2015 UTC,I'm not arguing that Wayne is better than the 06 Moss pick up. Just pointing out that he still had something in the tank last season.
Patriots,3e0h4t,kksred,3,Tue Jul 21 00:42:55 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I do not think you see a return to form on prime Wayne which is what happened with Moss and at least to me, is how I interpret ""could Wayne be moss 2.0, washed up WR has outstanding season""  1200-1500yds, ~10TDs for most of Wayne's prime  I could see Wayne fitting in as a guy giving us somewhere in the realm of 650-750yds, 4TD. The volume won't be there for him IMO"
Patriots,3e0h4t,CNDNFighter,2,Tue Jul 21 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"I think he is a better receiver (in the scheme sense) for Brady than he was for Luck. He is one of the best route runners in the league and for all that he lacks, he is in my opinion, a better pure receiver than Lafell and maybe even Edelman even at this stage of his career."
Patriots,3e0h4t,kksred,2,Tue Jul 21 00:46:55 2015 UTC,It's definitely not an unreasonable presumption but there is of course a lot of 'let's just wait and see' on this one
Patriots,3e0h4t,CNDNFighter,9,Tue Jul 21 00:54:58 2015 UTC,"Moss was ""washed up"" due to attitude and a lousy supporting cast.  He was still a highly intelligent receiver and one of the best athletes in the league    Wayne is washed up because his athleticism is depleted and his reactions have waned.  He struggles to separate, make tight cuts and go after the ball like he used to. He's toast as an offensive centerpiece. He's a complimentary safety blanket at best."
Patriots,3e0h4t,jonny_lube,3,Tue Jul 21 00:41:22 2015 UTC,"No.   Wayne is really, really old for a receiver.  He could have one last good year, sure. But odds are what we have seen the last few years is what he has.  Luck is a pass first, high output QB and Wayne was almost a non factor last year. He's probably done.  I would love for him to come here and magically be mid-00s Wayne.  But I doubt it."
Patriots,3e0h4t,DinkandDrunk,3,Tue Jul 21 01:54:59 2015 UTC,"Randy wasnt really ""washed up"""
Patriots,3e0h4t,pardi_man,2,Tue Jul 21 02:23:17 2015 UTC,"Randy Moss was still 30 when he was ""washed up"". He also went out of his way to create synergy with Tom Brady. Reggie Wayne is just not on that level of athleticism, talent and incoming commitment IMO."
Patriots,3e0h4t,RobbyJohnson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:38:51 2015 UTC,No way he puts up anywhere near moss type numbers. But it's possible that he comes back and has a healthy season and is a perfectly respectable 3rd or 4th option.
Patriots,3e0h4t,Bigbohn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"Wayne has very little in the tank, if anything. So no.  To me, Josh Gordon is the only true Moss 2.0 candidate and we should pursuit him very aggressively next season!"
Patriots,3e0h4t,Kevin_Jim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:16:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with this for a couple of reasons.  First, because he's coming off the suspension, and considered a ""risk"", the Pats would be able to get him signed for a (relative) bargain deal.  Second, his skill set is incredible, and even with a year off, he's still young with plenty of tread left on the tires.  I don't remember him having a long injury history, so... maybe offer the Browns a second-round pick in '16 and '17 for his rights?  Definite proven first round talent, why not roll the dice."
Patriots,3e0h4t,travelthrowaway1918,2,Tue Jul 21 08:31:55 2015 UTC,"2nd round is way to much for Gordon's trainwreck of a career. A 3rd round pick should do it. If we are talking about a 2nd round pick, it should only be a conditional one."
Patriots,3e0h4t,Kevin_Jim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:10:52 2015 UTC,"Browns might try to reclaim him if the Pats don't offer enough, though... maybe conditional 2nd round pick and a 4th round in '17?"
Patriots,3e0h4t,travelthrowaway1918,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:26:41 2015 UTC,"Way too much. 4th at the very tops. The kid is one infraction from expulsion from the league altogether, you think anyone is going to risk a 2nd rounder on a kid that could be gone for good at any minute?  He's only shown he can't keep his nose clean thus far."
Patriots,3e0h4t,2busy2blizzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:23 2015 UTC,That's why he said conditional.
Patriots,3e0h4t,Kevin_Jim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:08:09 2015 UTC,"He has one great year, we lose a second, and that offseason he's out of the league for good. He's not only an attitude risk, he's a risk to just vanish and take our second round pick with him."
Patriots,3e0h4t,2busy2blizzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:11:14 2015 UTC,"If he has such a great year that could justify the 2nd conditional (given that BB is the one that would be setting the prerequisites), it'll probably mean that we will be Super Bowl Champions again.  I am not saying that he is worth it, right now. I'm saying we should go after him and let BB work his magic."
Patriots,3e0h4t,Kevin_Jim,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:45:06 2015 UTC,"Would you rather have one good year from a receiver, or 4 years of Jamie Collins for extremely cheap, with the chance to extend him at any point? One year of a good receiver, or Gronk. You're grossly undervaluing second round picks"
Patriots,3e0h4t,2busy2blizzy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:30 2015 UTC,"No, I tried to offer a counter argument that even in the worst case scenario, which is him having an amazing year and then busting out like a typical Brown. We would probably get a SB ring out of it.  I prefer every 2nd round pick to be like Collins and Gronk. I also prefer every 6th rounder to be Tom Brady-like and every 7th like Jules. Which, unfortunately, can't happen."
Patriots,3dtukb,SuperEdel,24,Sun Jul 19 12:11:46 2015 UTC,"Oh man I remember when that happened, I was watching the game with my then gf and I mentioned (I know by now everyone has heard it 1000 times) how if Chandler Jones is anything like his brothers he'll be an athletic freak and how unusual it was for Belichick to have traded up twice in the first round for both of those guys.  Then they go and do that, what a start to the season."

To be fair though, last year he was having his best season by a long shot before injuries took him out for much of the year.

Patriots,3dtukb,TheMagicianDolph,4,Sun Jul 19 15:31:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's injuries and excessive play time tbh. Right when he comes back from injury and early in the season he's looked his best. He hasn't had the rise Collins has, which is too bad, but I don't think he's hit a plateau. If he's healthy I think this is going to be his best year.  Sheard and whatever we get out of the rookie edge guys should help him out a lot"

Patriots,3dtukb,2busy2blizzy,9,Sun Jul 19 16:56:16 2015 UTC,"I think you're making shit up. He's only gotten slightly better. Injuries, way too many snaps are probably the main factors. He breaks down towards the end of the season, and disappears in the playoffs. ie inconsistent."

The smart, long term move would be to declare as a Democrat and vote mostly along party lines. At the end of the day, you can't do anything if you are not elected. New England is mostly Democratic, but Liz Warren aside it is not Berkley. The problem with being a Republican in new England is not winning. He could certainly do that. But staying in power once the star power has faded. The region's Republican organization is very weak and he would have to build his own power base from scratch. Once he makes a few unpopular votes, the Democrats would use that in the election against him. It would be better   for him to be a bit of a maverick conservativish Democrat and not have to deal with the tarnished Republican brand in new England."

When you show them something like declassified documents admitting Lusitania, Gulf of Tonkin, NSA, CIA activity ect they just laugh, don't look up any facts and call you an idiot, ""but the news said this..."" just reminds me so much of ESPN lol. Sorry for my nutjob rant, I'll stop now.  But almost anyone who has a strong opinion still thinks 11 of the 12 balls were deflated and knows nothing about the Colts also and the other issues including the gauge issue, only testing 4 colts balls, science actually supporting the Pats, ect and no matter what they just go ""well it doesn't matter he didn't cooperate and look at the texts, it's obvious he did it!!!""   But even when some acknowledge the science doesn't hold up they will still go ""TOM HAD TO KNOW THOSE WERE TAMPERED WITH THOSE GUYS DIDN'T JUST DO IT ON THEIR OWN"" despite having no evidence that they were tampered with?? Zero consistency, it baffles my mind. I don't even give a shit about it even if he did do it, but if you're going to punish someone as harshly as they did you better have some legitimate evidence instead of two texts that we have limited context of. I'd love to see how often those two dorito dink's say stupid shit to eachother all the time esp about their duties on gameday just as many of jobs. If someone read my texts without knowing my humor about my work they might think I not only have serious issues but want to negatively impact their bottom line, but I just happen to like to say stupid/funny shit to my co-workers.   Or the other aspect ""WHY WOULD THE NFL WANT TO HARM THE GOLDEN BOY"" is such an absurd argument especially when these are the same people who bash Goodell nonstop about his decision making in every other case he's involved with. The over the top bias against the Patriots is laughable.   For anyone that missed the Jim Turner awhile back it's definitely a good listen.

Depending on how long you will be in town and what you are into - Denver is great for 2 lifestyles: the drinker and the outdoorsman.     Breweries all over town. I'd reccomend Denver Beer Co., Great Divide, Wynkoop, and a few others. Chautauqua park in Boulder has a few cool hikes. Boulder is also worth checking out.     You can also drive out to Golden Colorado, bring some tubes and float down Clear creek. Did it the other day and the water level was high, pretty intense but fun. Golden also has the Coors Brewery (I don't necessarily recommend but you do get 3 free beers) and Golden City brewing company, which I do recommend (Small, outdoors in the shadow of the mountains and has a food truck, if the weather is good.) Disregard the float the river thing as it will be November.     Places to see music: The Ogden, The Fillmore, Cervantes, The bluebird.    Rocky Mountain National park is a 2 hour drive from Denver (tops) and totally worth the visit.    If the weather is nice I'd say a brew tour on bikes is the way to go. A ton of great restaurants/bars in the downtown/highlands area and bike friendly.   Let me know if you have any specific questions it is hard to spit ball on monday mornings.

Patriots,3dty3m,OhRatFarts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:38:53 2015 UTC,For more likely than not knowing about deflated balls. Not even deflating them.
Patriots,3dty3m,2big_2fail,2,Mon Jul 20 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"I'm sure their briefs are nearly complete, just finish the sentence on outcome of the appeal.  I feel it'll be filed within the hour of announcement."
Patriots,3dty3m,OhRatFarts,4,Sun Jul 19 19:36:20 2015 UTC,Goodell's actions in Brady's appeal are another litigation minefield. He could make a mistake and blow up the case even more.
Patriots,3dty3m,amarras,4,Mon Jul 20 00:30:38 2015 UTC,Oh I'm sure he will
Patriots,3dty3m,2big_2fail,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:13:02 2015 UTC,"Actually I think the opposite, in litigation he'll have insanely expensive lawyers with him every step of the way, telling what to say and do, and when to say and do it, and he'll realize he actually needs to listen to them"
Patriots,3dty3m,Tatekei,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:51:54 2015 UTC,That's my point... Goodell has bumbled himself into the middle of a minefield. The lawyers are probably saying he has to stand his ground or surrender.  Anything else would just look more arbitrary.
Patriots,3dty3m,13012015,4,Mon Jul 20 09:19:38 2015 UTC,Impeach Goodell?
Patriots,3dty3m,bjb406,6,Sun Jul 19 14:18:42 2015 UTC,They just held the owners meeting and Kraft backed down from confrontation. To me this indicates that Goodell is unlikely to be relieved of his duties in the immediate future.  Edit: Sadly.
Patriots,3dty3m,bigfike,5,Sun Jul 19 15:18:15 2015 UTC,"Kraft could never come down on Goodell on this and expect the other owners to take his side, because it would seem too self serving. But once this whole mess is settled, the next stupid thing he does he has to be gone."
Patriots,3dty3m,robbs0629,2,Sun Jul 19 18:00:00 2015 UTC,I'm convinced he's got something up his sleeve. The Kraft family doesn't forget.

Patriots,3dty3m,drscorp,3,Sun Jul 19 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"Ugh. This whole thing is such a joke. Dude knew what he was going to do weeks, if not, months ago."
Patriots,3dty3m,dd2811,3,Sun Jul 19 19:51:19 2015 UTC,"I like to imagine that he actually is deliberating.  ""Hold my calls. I have to... think!""  Then he just goes into his office and stares at the door all day for weeks."
Patriots,3dty3m,2big_2fail,2,Sun Jul 19 20:12:29 2015 UTC,"Goodell: ""Hmm... what would this door do...""  Assistant: ""Mr. Goodell it's been a month, the public would like...""  Goodell: ""CAN'T YOU SEE I'M BUSY""  Assistant: ""..."""
Patriots,3dty3m,alphaqwright,2,Sun Jul 19 20:46:19 2015 UTC,"Whatever Goodell's decision, his response and reasoning are a big deal if the issue goes to court. If he modifies the discipline it looks even more arbitrary and capricious.  I think Goodell has to uphold his previous decision or completely remove Brady's suspension and avoid adding further irregularities for fear of future litigation."

Patriots,3ds8mu,kjg1228,6,Sun Jul 19 19:05:14 2015 UTC,That's something only a patriots fan would say.   Bold statement coming from a Seahawks fan....
Patriots,3ds8mu,Heiz3n,-7,Sun Jul 19 20:31:40 2015 UTC,"Or I'm a football fan.  What If I told you that you can be interested and root for many many teams at once.  I'm guessing you saw I posted in Seahawks but didn't read what I wrote.  Or you would've seen me complimenting Tom Brady on his contract and insulting Russells agent, while getting insults by hawk fans and informed I didn't know how to spell russell wilson.  And my last post in r/nfl was me saying RW carries his team the least of any QB in the league.  You got me mr bandwagon fan."
Patriots,3ds8mu,kjg1228,3,Sun Jul 19 20:44:41 2015 UTC,"So you insult me for generalizing based on your posts, then generalize me based on my fandom? I've been going to Pats games since before Gillette even broke ground.   You complimenting Brady's contract means absolutely nothing, because it's the most team-friendly contract for any elite QB. Any idiot who can crunch numbers can tell you it's a good deal for the team."
Patriots,3ds8mu,Heiz3n,-5,Sun Jul 19 20:52:56 2015 UTC,Lol sure you have buddy.  Everyone believes you.  Haha.

Patriots,3dur3x,KissTheRings617,18,Sun Jul 19 17:51:22 2015 UTC,I would have said Wes before this superbowl. But after edelman took that hit over the middle from chancellor and kept battling... There's just no way I'm picking Wes... He would have exploded and dropped that ball on that play 99 times out of 100.   But we cannot blame Wes for that drop in 2011. He was wide open and Brady missed him. A better throw by a few inches and Wes makes that catch and takes it at least an extra 10 yards.
Patriots,3dur3x,loochbag17,8,Sun Jul 19 20:18:11 2015 UTC,"I've explained it thousands of times in extreme detail, so I'll try to quick-summarize as best as possible:  Welker did not read the play well.  You look here and you see Welker is in between basically 3 men. With #21 running horizontally, there is one perfect spot for the ball to go, and that's on the imaginary line that Wes and #26 are on.  Then you look at when the ball hits off of Wes' hands that the ball is placed on that exact spot I just mentioned above! But because Welker couldn't recognize this, he pushed himself too far vertically and didnt break a little towards the sidelines, which is where Brady wanted the ball to go. He had to then contort his body too late in the process, and the ball hits off his hands. If he broke towards the sidelines earlier, thats an easy catch.  That's absolutely on Wes."
Patriots,3dur3x,bosoxlover12,2,Mon Jul 20 03:25:34 2015 UTC,"Unless you have a knowledge of the playbook, this entire post is pure conjecture. Receivers don't adjust their routes however they want. Option routes are one thing but even those work in a controlled manner such that the QB knows where the WR will be exactly."
Patriots,3dur3x,kksred,2,Mon Jul 20 14:52:20 2015 UTC,"This wasn't even really a matter of changing the route. Receivers read and adjust body positioning based on defenders as a matter of routine on more than just option routes. You can run a non-option route and still determine which which shoulder (inside/outside) the QB is most likely aiming based on where the safety is shading relative to any other defender. Welker didn't see the safety and didn't realize Brady was going for his outside shoulder (by far the safer spot) until he was already turned in.   It's not Madden, there's more to it than just what route you run."
Patriots,3dur3x,jetpack_operation,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:16 2015 UTC,A back shoulder throw still doesn't make you change your route. Your route is still the same but you change your body position to make a catch.
Patriots,3dur3x,kksred,7,Mon Jul 20 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"If you're referring to the Superbowl I definitely blame Welker. Although, the way the entire team was dropping the ball, I wouldn't be surprised if the ref over-inflated the Patriots balls."
Patriots,3dur3x,jeffwingersballs,6,Mon Jul 20 00:50:38 2015 UTC,Except for Danny Woodhead. Danny Woodhead made that Superbowl his bitch.

Patriots,3dur3x,livinlifeontheedge,0,Mon Jul 20 04:08:55 2015 UTC,"me too, but that day showed me the bets is yet to come for Edelman. He is just hitting his stride, and his 2 season average is extremely comparable (almost identical) to Welkers 6 seasons in this offense"
Patriots,3dur3x,mattsparrow,8,Tue Jul 21 01:09:52 2015 UTC,"I think comparing the two is a bit silly because quite frankly its unlikely we win the super bowl this year if our offense was reliant on just Gronk and Edelman.  Look at the super bowl in 2011 and 2007, in one we had Moss and Welker as our main guys, but frankly gaffney and stallworth both didnt get it done. Fast forward to 2011 and Gronk is hobbled, and hernandez and an aging Branch both proved to be just a bit too little to get the job done. Welker balled out in both those games.  Now look at our offensive group this past year. You've got Gronk, Edelman, Lafell, and Amendola, and a monster performance from Vereen, while Blount is a servicable back. All those guys are tailor made to help Bradys skill set, and Lafell in particular rounded out our group because of his ability to attack the perimeter, and Amendola is the perfect #3 WR, hell he'd make a decent #2 or #1 on some teams. If we'd had guys like Lafell and Amendola to round out welker and Gronk, or Welker and Moss, then we likely win it all in 2011 or 2007. Not to mention we probably win in 2011 with Gronk healthier. I miss hernandez' skill set, but he wasn't the best player ever or anything.  Im fine with somebody disagreeing with that point, but look at the third quarter of this last super bowl. Edelman went to make the touchdown, Brady slightly overthrows him (sounds familiar?) and he can't make the catch. On the next play Amendola gets the touchdown, setting up for the next drive in the 4th where Edelman succeeds in making the go ahead score. Without a reliable 3rd/4th target like Amendola, we probably lose, and we'd all look back at that failed connection the same way we look at Welkers drop (though I would argue Hernandez and Branch had worse drops in 2011).   So for me it really boils down to the Pats having a more complete team this year. In their primes Welker and Edelman are both so good that I'm gonna need another year or two to truly decide. Hell I might even lean towards Edelman right now, but I can't say its not a debate worth having. I do think Edelman is a more complete and versatile player."
Patriots,3dur3x,kamkam321,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:34:46 2015 UTC,"Great point you make about the supporting cast. A lot of people forget that when it came to the playoffs and good defences the Pats offense would stall just because they were setting records for points scored, offensive snaps and the hurry up offense.   The Ravens absolutely smothered the Pats in 2011 and 2012 and the Giants. Even 2013 was a very iffy season offensively which many people might forget because of the last minute comebacks against the Saints, Broncos and Browns.   This season the Pats weren't as flashy as earlier but it was one of the most balanced teams I've seen them field since maybe 2010."
Patriots,3dur3x,mattsparrow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:45:57 2015 UTC,I agree completely. Bradys always magnificent but you just cant win superbowls if your relying on two weapons. Great defences are gonna stop it.   And hell yea about the balance. Last years team was perfect complimentary football. An efficient offense that was great on third down and a defence that was tough to run on and could shut down number one receivers. They could blow you out and win a close game
Patriots,3dur3x,kksred,6,Mon Jul 20 16:49:53 2015 UTC,"Would you take Robert Horry over Steve Nash? Because that's what you are saying you will do.  Edelman is an awesome guy. Would be great to hang out with. But objectively, he is at best a top 20 WR.  Welker on the other hand was getting all-pros which means he was a top 5 WR. Two drops dont change that because without him, we wouldn't even be in a situation where have a chance at the SB."
Patriots,3dur3x,edgeoftheworld42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:15:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we're also only in a position where Welker's drops matter because our defense - which included Julian Edelman playing CB - held up their end of the bargain."
Patriots,3dur3x,kksred,2,Mon Jul 20 03:22:26 2015 UTC,Oh c'mon. Edelman was barely a factor on D.
Patriots,3dur3x,edgeoftheworld42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:24:38 2015 UTC,"True - but the question is whether that's praise or not. To play devil's advocate...  Edelman played about 30 snaps at the DB in the Superbowl. Can you imagine what a QB like Tom Brady would do against a WR playing CB? Look what Brady did to Simon in the Superbowl, who is an actual CB. Or another against Melvin (I believe) of the Ravens, who is also a CB.   The fact that Edelman was ""barely a factor"" is itself quite impressive. He's also credited with a forced fumble against the Ravens in the AFCCG that year."
Patriots,3dur3x,kksred,2,Mon Jul 20 03:40:47 2015 UTC,There is no way he saw 30 snaps in the SB. Absolutely no way.   He played for a drive or two vs Ravens iirc and that was it.
Patriots,3dur3x,TheMagicianDolph,4,Mon Jul 20 03:45:53 2015 UTC,Yup where are people getting this bs from? All started watching in 2013.
Patriots,3dur3x,kksred,0,Mon Jul 20 05:58:37 2015 UTC,"all-pro voting is relevant to this how? Wes was a bigger name, the WR play is much better a whole today (see 2014/2015 draft class) Edelman has been underrated these last years and with that playoff run he will finally get some recognition. I believe in never bringing all pro or probowl honors into a discussion to make a case those are no where near credible"
Patriots,3dur3x,lordmadone,2,Tue Jul 21 01:12:37 2015 UTC,"All pro isnt a popularity contest. It's not voted on by fans.    the WR play is much better a whole today (see 2014/2015 draft class   No. Just no. Fitz was in his prime. Andre was in his prime. Calvin was killing it. Reggie was killing it. TO, Chad, Hines Ward, Bruce, Smith, Driver and I'm sure there are plenty that are missing in my list.   Edelman has been underrated these last years and with that playoff run he will finally get some recognition.   I'm saying a WR who had only 1 1000 yard season is possibly top 20. If anything I am overrating him.    I believe in never bringing all pro or probowl honors into a discussion to make a case those are no where near credible   Fine. Let's just look at stats. Welker as a starter averaged 250 yards more every season. It's not a contest."
Patriots,3dur3x,jetpack_operation,5,Tue Jul 21 01:40:09 2015 UTC,"Welker did far more during his tenure than Edelman has, SO FAR. Edelman has had two very good years season and post-season wise. Welker, to me, was more integral from a production perspective BUT Edelman's added eliteness in the punt return game made/makes it about even in that respect to me.  Welker has the edge but if Edelman puts up another two very good years, I'd say it is tied or perhaps give the edge to Edelman who was a key cog in the post-season."
Patriots,3dur3x,Starbellies,2,Sun Jul 19 19:49:47 2015 UTC,"Welker, to me, was more integral from a production perspective   And in a weird way, this made our offense a little predictable at times as the year went on. Brady got a little myopic with his safety blanket on the field. You can see it with Gronk a bit too, but Gronk is a) far more talented, so it's not like you can really stop him even if you know where it's going, b) has had more injury issues than Welker did, so Brady's been forced to cope without him.   I was a pretty big fan of how much Brady spread the ball around last season."
Patriots,3dur3x,TaylorSwiftIsGod,14,Mon Jul 20 15:45:38 2015 UTC,Edelman just seems to want it more. I swear he willed the Pats to win that Super Bowl.
Patriots,3dur3x,Starbellies,-2,Sun Jul 19 18:37:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, welker just wasn't feelin it in those Super Bowls."
Patriots,3dur3x,JREtard,5,Mon Jul 20 02:07:17 2015 UTC,"Well, when he dropped the ball I sure felt it."
Patriots,3dur3x,jax0047,17,Mon Jul 20 02:20:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think you'll get much backlash for taking Edelman.  Edelman competes harder, is more versatile, is a team player, and is more clutch.  And he's just plain cooler."
Patriots,3dur3x,JREtard,2,Sun Jul 19 18:11:59 2015 UTC,Welker didn't give 100%?
Patriots,3dur3x,jax0047,2,Sun Jul 19 22:50:46 2015 UTC,Debatable.
Patriots,3dur3x,JKCIO,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:44:11 2015 UTC,"Ha, I love that scene. Anyone who's started a football game knows how hard it can be to play special teams and then go over and start on O or D on the next play after you just sprinted 50 yards. Something to think about when you compare the stats of any two WR's   (obviously in this case they both returned punts)"
Patriots,3dur3x,JKCIO,3,Mon Jul 20 00:33:16 2015 UTC,Exactly my thoughts. I was called mentally challenged and a 'new football fan' for this stance on another threat

Patriots,3dur3x,merlindegr8,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:53:41 2015 UTC,Welker.  Autocorrect
Patriots,3dur3x,jax0047,3,Sun Jul 19 23:53:55 2015 UTC,"They aren't actually the same type of receiver.  Welker is a slot receiver.  Possibly the best.  But Edelman, while being a small white receiver, is not the same player as Welker.  He's not used in the same way.  It's hard to compare the two."
Patriots,3dur3x,ctpatsfan77,6,Mon Jul 20 00:15:50 2015 UTC,"Heart plays alone, I take Edelman.  The play where he makes a catch ducks and spins beneath a tackle, then lunges forward for an extra 4 yards, is to me , the epitome of Heart. Welker had a lot of heart as well but No one played harder for the Patriots in any superbowl than Jules in this last one."
Patriots,3dur3x,jax0047,4,Mon Jul 20 01:18:57 2015 UTC,This is silly. Edelman has had 1 welker season. Welker always had welker seasons. Sure they won the Superbowl but let's see if the kid can hold up for a few more NFL seasons.
Patriots,3dur3x,TheMagicianDolph,2,Sun Jul 19 22:49:50 2015 UTC,2 'welker' seasons...
Patriots,3dur3x,kksred,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:02:52 2015 UTC,"Ummm . . . he's had two Welker seasons.  And a lot of people forget this, but at the point where he broke his forearm in 2009, Edelperson was leading all rookies in receptions. Who knows what would have happened if he had stayed healthy."
Patriots,3dur3x,porkchopgreasy,3,Mon Jul 20 03:28:02 2015 UTC,I wasn't forgetting he got hurt. That's part of my point. I'm not questioning edelmans talent but Welker averaged 1243 yards per year over 6 years in ne. Edelman (barely) cracked 1000 once in his career and hasn't proven he can stay healthy. If you think these guys are even close you have a very short memory.
Patriots,3dur3x,kksred,6,Mon Jul 20 12:13:02 2015 UTC,"You can't use just rings, wins, and clutchness when you're rating QBs. No one would take you seriously. Brady is probably the most balanced when you also add in stats. Brady is top 5 all time in pretty much every QB category. When we're defending Brady from Manning fanboys we're not talking about a chump in terms of stats. He'll probably pass Marino's mark of 420 TD passes this year putting him 3rd all time.  Edelman has had 2 good years. He's already nearing 30. If he can get 4 more consistent years even nearing Welker's production then you can talk.   What backlash are you expecting? This is /r/edelman."
Patriots,3dur3x,porkchopgreasy,2,Sun Jul 19 18:44:22 2015 UTC,Wait what? I've never seen Edelman block more successfully than Welker did. Literally never.   EDIT: To rephrase since my statement makes it seem like i think Welker is a good blocker: Neither of them are particularly good blockers.
Patriots,3dur3x,kksred,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:40:38 2015 UTC,Did you watch the first drive of super bowl xlix?
Patriots,3dur3x,venture70,2,Mon Jul 20 02:24:57 2015 UTC,I watched the whole game. Are you going to now pick out one block Edelman made in that drive and ask me to consider that to be the way Edelman blocks always and forever?   What if I pick a play where Edelman blocks poorly? Should I consider that to be proof that Edelman sucks at blocking?
Patriots,3dur3x,Stfuppercut,0,Mon Jul 20 02:45:42 2015 UTC,"He broke a dudes leg. The definitive moment of the game. Need I say more?    Argue all you want. Given the intangibles, the absolute point of my original comment, I believe JE11 is the man over Wes."
Patriots,3dur3x,SonofSteve123,2,Mon Jul 20 02:49:54 2015 UTC,"First off, it was the arm that broke. Secondly, it wasn't the first drive.   And it wasn't Edelman who broke the arm. It was Lane who landed awkwardly on it.   After that, tackling ability is like literally the last thing I'll look for in a WR.  If you want to argue that the tackle attempt shows Edelman cares while Welker was just there for the pay check, that would be stupid too because Welker has never shied away from contact and has always done everything that was asked of him."
Patriots,3dur3x,JKCIO,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:54:22 2015 UTC,"When did I say that? I said when we the brady-manning debate comes up, NE fans say 3 things: wins, rings, clutch ability.  Well you came pretty strong before, defending Welker and saying I am a retard and mentally challenged, so strange tone change all of the sudden.  Give me Edelman, end of story"
Patriots,3dur3x,TheMagicianDolph,6,Mon Jul 20 02:59:06 2015 UTC,"Wes had some incredible stats while here, no doubt.  And, I don't completely blame him for the Superbowl drop, which was a difficult pass to say the least.  But IMO there's no comparison between the internal fire of the two.  Wes, even at his best and pre-concussions, always had that sleepy, glazed-eyed, pot-smoker calmness about him.  Edelman inspires others around him, rallies the troops in difficult times, tells everyone he loves them, and is ready to run through a brick wall to prove all of it.    And, of course there's this short clip, that explains a lot about Welker and Belichick's feelings toward both players.  So, I agree with you.  If I'm going to war or the Superbowl, I pick Edelman over Welker."
Patriots,3dur3x,Starbellies,4,Mon Jul 20 03:04:44 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Welker was very calm, and I think it hurt him in the key moments. Edelman plays with so much 'want' and fire that he benefits in pressure situations, while Wes is the opposite."
Patriots,3dur3x,TheMagicianDolph,0,Mon Jul 20 03:09:59 2015 UTC,"In that regard, I think Edelman complements Brady. They show the same drive and desire to win. I think Welker is the better player overall, but the connection between 11 and 12 is a lot stronger."
Patriots,3dur3x,dd2811,3,Mon Jul 20 03:12:25 2015 UTC,"Guys look, I love Edelman way more than I ever Loved Wes and yes Wes shrunk in big moments but If you honestly think Edelman is better then Prime Welker you must not have watched the pats during his tenure"

Patriots,3dur3x,TaylorSwiftIsGod,3,Mon Jul 20 11:31:00 2015 UTC,Oh is age not a factor in your opinion?
Patriots,3dur3x,NFLVideoConverterBot,2,Sun Jul 19 21:16:50 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing about both guys: Welker was a stat machine, the ultimate slot receiver. Guy was a warrior. He put up the numbers like Reggie Wayne or Andre Johnson did.  Edelman is a playmaker amd more athletic than Welker; more of a Lynn Swann type in terms of those attributes. He's also more versatile playing at corner and punt returner. He steps it up in big games but it doesn't necessarily show up in the stats. I'd take either on my team, no doubt."
Patriots,3dur3x,zipperoooo,0,Sun Jul 19 23:57:00 2015 UTC,"agree with everything you said expect the stats, as if you look at the stats these last 2 years they are right in line with an average Welker year. let the sample set widen, and people on here will start to lean Edelman"
Patriots,3dur3x,TaylorSwiftIsGod,2,Mon Jul 20 01:44:43 2015 UTC,Wes Welker. Edelman is tough. But can we really say that welker isn't? Suffered multiple concussions and played through them. Tore his ACL and MCL and played the next season from week one. Caught 100+ balls 5 times. Racked up YAC. Edelman is a better punt returner and better after the catch. But welker was a better overall receiver.
Patriots,3dur3x,zipperoooo,0,Mon Jul 20 02:17:30 2015 UTC,"Ok but Jules also thought we were playing ""St Louis"" in the Super Bowl."

Patriots,3dr5k6,War_Daddy,4,Sat Jul 18 23:57:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a firm believer in the infallibility of the Schef God, but you have to take him with a grain of salt on Deflategate at this point. He's obviously very strongly on Brady's side on this, not used to seeing Schef with any kind of bias."
Patriots,3dr5k6,T_Blitz,24,Sat Jul 18 18:01:10 2015 UTC,He's probably on Brady's side because he realizes how completely insane this whole thing is and how ESPN has blatantly lied throughout this entire fiasco.
Patriots,3dr5k6,zOmgFishes,10,Sat Jul 18 18:06:23 2015 UTC,"Schefter is one of the few people at ESPN who actually does legitimate reporting. Hence that whole JPP medical records thing, he actually showed he had evidence and wasn't talking out of his ass like other ESPN employees. (Broussard for instance)"
Patriots,3dr5k6,T_Blitz,4,Sat Jul 18 18:10:50 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately most others at espn have ruined the network  by falsifying information and showing inherent bias solely for click bait. Its too bad people like shefter get lumped in, but at this point espn cant be taken any more serious than an MTV reality show. Best thing I did was stop watching completely about a week after deflategate broke."

It snapped them into action, woke them up from whatever sleep mode they were in. And above all, it made the XLIX victory that much sweeter.  I remember walking into work the next day, and one of the guys I was friends with who worked next door was a Chiefs fan, knew I was a Pats fan and him and my other friend just stood up and gave me a round of applause as I walked by in my Brady jersey. Not really malicious, just playful jabbing at our loss. I turned to them and said something to the likes of ""Yeah, we got our asses kicked.

Patriots,3dqsah,jrdnism,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"While the story would be the best EVER in NFL history, -- imagine Brady missing even a game, and this team just taking off the second he came back, 07 type offense-- it is just so hard to repeat in the NFL (never mind being the only team to do it in decades), and this would make it TWICE.  But unfortunately it will be close to impossible to be as good as we were last year, that team was just such a force, it is actually incredible how underrated that team was in terms of this era...We withstood losing a defensive captain and basically an offensive captain (mankins) just before the season.  We lost Mayo, plus all other LB depth, Mankins, and Ridley all very soon in the season or before it...And they made some STEAL trades/singings to grab replacements (which they have been $$$$$$ at going back to the Talib deal)---Ayers, Casillas, Blount*, along with KILLING free agency for really the first time in years, bringing in 2 starting corners to give us (along with Dmac) one of the top 2 secondaries in the league (can certainly even make the case it is better than SEA considering they did that one 1 year, as opposed to the SEA 3 playing/jelling for 4+ years together)  I think even with Brady forced to sit out 4 games (which is unlikely IMO), this team is definitely the AFCs Best...But there are 3-4 teams in the NFC that are on their level -- GB...SEA...and make your case for DAL....and I you know one of AZ/STL is going to be a force this year, that division breads 2 forces per year now.  edit a few sp errors and add context"
Patriots,3dqsah,KissTheRings617,3,Sat Jul 18 17:11:28 2015 UTC,"I still think people are SLEEPING on this offense... Seriously, this is the first time Brady will take the field, in his career, with this many weapons. People will say 07, but Gronk is better than Moss was in 07. brings way more to the table. Edelman is already better than Welker ever was, Chandler is a matchup nightmare in the redzone next to the leagues biggest nightmare period in Gronk. LaFell proved to be a very solid #3. Amendola is one of the leagues best #4 options. and they, as always these last few years, will be able to run on almost every single team. Brady has never had this good an offense going into the year. Say the same thing for depth, and balance of the offense as well. They will have a monster year.   Sure we had good/great a running game in the SB days with a number of backs (mostly Dillion for a short time), but Brady never had weapons that people would say was in the top half of the league. Just a bunch of scrappy guys making plays, until they decided to adapt to the BS rule change cuz the Colts are whiny bitches (version 1.0, as V 2.0 and 3.0 would come in following years).  Unfortunately to beat the top teams in the NFC, we will need to be be very good defensively. They can get there, but they will need to slowly improve each week and play their best game in the SB, possible but difficult. Wont rule it out with this coach and QB. But As ALWAYS health is key, and we have had some real tough luck in that department since 2007 (Brady, Welker, Gronk x3, Vince, Talib x2, Dola, Ridley, Mayo, and more)   only difference as last year they were deep enough to withstand 2 bigger injuries. this year that will be way more difficult."
Patriots,3dqsah,KissTheRings617,2,Sat Jul 18 17:28:42 2015 UTC,"My prediction for this season is that TB12 wins MVP, has a ridiculous season--statement year, and he has the best toys...for the first time in his career....weapons as good as Manning plays with every.single.year --  But he missing a few games, and the defense starting the year a little slow as well and taking time to round into form (as every other year under BB, just maybe 3-4 weeks longer this year than the last 3 and esp. last year)...  Due to that, and a game(or games) missed by TB12, they finish as the #2/3 seed (look at IND schedule and tell me that the Bills couldnt win 11/12 games with that soft full season matchups).   I think they will need some real luck to host the AFC championship at home, and for teams like IND, CIN, SD, etc... I am not worried about needing to travel to BAL/PIT and then DEN if peyton somehow stays healthy, but those would be difficult games and ones that I would understand if they lost.  so in my mind, only way they are not in the SB is if they are forced to play at BAL, PIT, and a healthy peytons DEN, I say 60/40 they make the SB if forced to play on the road vs one of these 3 teams..   even then if they are getting points, or less than a TD favorite, I would bet heavy on NE, but if they did lose I would understand....another team would be a shock.   if they make it, the SB is typically 50/50 an anything can happen, see Patriots, 2001...or (sorry) NYG 2007. Or even almost SEA 2014 (thank you Butler, I owe you everything)   The better team can lose that final game, so while I think the NFC will have 3 teams better than NE, its a toss up in SF.   The story will be among the all time best SB or even league narratives in history, win or lose"

Patriots,3dnq8r,dd2811,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:49:13 2015 UTC,Espn has been trasing my team since 2000. Our best beat writer volin left to cover the pats and the best guy we have now is taking shots at marino for never winning a superbowl. If you admit to being a dolphins fan you need thick skin.
Patriots,3dnq8r,flesh_tearers_tear,4,Sat Jul 18 19:56:42 2015 UTC,"Thick skin? No one I know hates the Phins (besides AFCE rivals) . I rarely hear anyone talk about them aside from Tanehill or big free agents they sign, and I'm not saying that to be a jerk, that's just been my experience. It's easy to be a Dolphins fan nowadays imo, especially if what you told me is all you deal with. Our entire Boston media shits on our own teams, it's brutal up here (aside from a few writers). And look Espn trashes other teams this is true, but there is no team hated in sports more than the Pats.  How often they get shit on between sports radio and other media is ludicrous. Pats fans get defensive because well feel we have to fight back somehow.   Yea, some of us are way to too sensitive that's for sure, but I totally disagree when you try and compare having thick skin as a Pats fan vs a Phins fan. I'll say it prob wasn't so bad until the deflategate stuff aside from some annoying internet trolling, but Espn has become just like the internet, it's bad."
Patriots,3dnq8r,dd2811,0,Sat Jul 18 20:13:49 2015 UTC,"What I mean about having it rough is ive been a fan since I was 6.  That year we got beat by the Jills in the afc east championship game at our house. I have never seen my yeam get to the afc east championship game since. I think weve only one one playoff game that wasnt a wildcard game since then. It sucks being a dolphins fan and its eay being a pats fan.   The worst part is we have the froggen jets fans down here.   Our superbowl last year was beating you guys in miami.   When you guys have a bad year and an actual bad year, not a  year you dont win the division and still make the playoffs like 08, come and talk to me."
Patriots,3dnq8r,flesh_tearers_tear,2,Sat Jul 18 21:03:29 2015 UTC,"Yea I gotcha. I'm coming from more of a natl perspective of hate regardless of whether you win or lose.

That's the only reason he didn't play last year. So him having a decent year isn't really that inmpressive. How is that comparable to the other 3 coming back from awful injuries.

Patriots,3dnq8r,LeftShark2012,11,Sat Jul 18 03:07:23 2015 UTC,He still lost. I respect LeBron playing the way he did and he deserved a nomination. He absolutely shouldn't have won. Bumgarner balled just as hard and actually won the championship
Patriots,3dnq8r,TB12toJE11,-3,Sat Jul 18 02:22:54 2015 UTC,"Bumgarner balled, but he didn't have a historical performance.. LeBron deserved it, and I hate LeBron."
Patriots,3dnq8r,NotAModBro,2,Sat Jul 18 13:49:52 2015 UTC,"You're totally incorrect. Bumgarner now has the lowest ERA in World Series history (0.25), pitched a record 52.2 innings in the postseason with a 1.01 ERA (best of any pitcher with >40 innings), had the longest save in WS history by 4 outs, and had the most dominant WS performance since 1933."
Patriots,3dnq8r,WalnutSurprise,-4,Sat Jul 18 14:44:30 2015 UTC,"Bumgarner also had a team to help him, he didn't win it on his own. What LeBron did was on his own, completely epic. I watched Bumgarner and LeBron. Bumgarner never made me say ""Holy shit"" Lebron had me say that over and over."

Patriots,3dnq8r,Claypool2112,-1,Sat Jul 18 11:07:59 2015 UTC,The award isn't based off of a win or a loss. Its based off of him having a historical performance that probably will never be repeated again. Someone else can do what Bumgarner did.
Patriots,3dnq8r,NotAModBro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:50:39 2015 UTC,"Right, so Kobe never posted stats like Lebron before. Meanwhile any pitcher can replicate what Baumgardner did....  Look at us all arguing over an Espy award, which means just as much as a nickelodeon kids award."

Patriots,3dnq8r,NotAModBro,4,Sat Jul 18 16:52:25 2015 UTC,"Although he didn't win the finals MVP, so clearly there was at least one performance better /s  Really, the awards seemed to be ""if I posted this online, who would get the most votes?""  OBJ's play is another easy example -- there were better out there, but OH GOD DID YOU SEE THAT CATCH ON SPORTSCENTER?"
Patriots,3dnq8r,SuperStapleHorse,2,Sat Jul 18 01:38:04 2015 UTC,That play made my mom scream in exictment and she never does that for non patriots football. Ahe yelled at me to put the gane on...again she never does that.  Thats why im ok with thr OBJ catch winning
Patriots,3dnq8r,The_Moustache,0,Sat Jul 18 11:50:05 2015 UTC,Agreed.  That was a great catch. A few of my fantasy group members posted about it immediately on fb afterwards. It was a great catch.

Patriots,3dnq8r,jotch,5,Sat Jul 18 03:07:33 2015 UTC,That's a bit excessive. Lebron gets away with a lot of travels but so does the rest of the leauge. It's not every possession.
Patriots,3dnq8r,parrisnorris,3,Sat Jul 18 03:30:24 2015 UTC,"It's not so much that for me, but more the fact that he's allowed to shove defenders with his off-hand every time he drives. If you want to defend him you need to be able to take an arm-bar to the chest without pushing back, because if you do you'll get called for a foul."

The only players on the Patriots' offense that top talents are: Brady and Gronk. Also, Brady had to overcome the revolving door placed in front of him.  But, you can see it in a different way. One that I do not share. It's ok.  Btw, we are comparing apple to oranges here. Football has: offense, defense and special teams. Basketball has offense/defense. It's extremely had, if not unfair to compare rosters between these sports. Which is what we do.  Lets just say they both did great and that you liked the performance of Lebron more and I Brady's."
Patriots,3dnq8r,Kevin_Jim,0,Sat Jul 18 16:09:44 2015 UTC,"Brady, Gronk, Edelman. Then has his defense. The cavs were WITHOUT their 2nd and 3rd man. They could not sub as much as well due to a lack of players."

Patriots,3do70n,zipperoooo,7,Fri Jul 17 21:48:25 2015 UTC,Well the real standard is whether or not it caused actually damages. He could sue them for libel and slander though for sure
Patriots,3do70n,watrutalkingaboot,13,Sat Jul 18 01:54:21 2015 UTC,"Defamation is an umbrella term that encompasses both libel and slander.  For a public figure like Tom Brady, he would have to prove that ESPN acted with knowledge of the falsity of their statements, or with reckless disregard for the truth (this is the NYT v. Sullivan standard).  It's not an impossible standard, but it's a high one.  A public figure usually needs ""smoking gun"" evidence (like an email saying ""eh we know it might not be tru but run the story anyway"") to win a defamation case."
Patriots,3do70n,Nevermore60,2,Sat Jul 18 05:33:52 2015 UTC,"It would probably have to say ""We knew it wasn't true, but we ran it anyway.""

The burden is on the plaintiff to prove falsity of a statement in a defamation case.  So before anybody would have to defend themselves by giving up any sources, the plaintiff would have to establish that ""the Patriots cheated"" was a patently false statement.  FWIW, a defendant would probably also defend on the grounds that ""cheated"" is a subjective standard and they were stating an opinion, making a defamatio conviction even more difficult."
Patriots,3do70n,Nevermore60,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:57:25 2015 UTC,"the plaintiff would have to establish that ""the Patriots cheated"" was a patently false statement.

Is that a false statement when ESPN reporters time and time again publicly stated that the Patriots cheated with deflateGate, while not even the official Wells report couldn't prove it? Honestly asking, I am not a lawyer - obviously."
Patriots,3do70n,Kevin_Jim,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:29:43 2015 UTC,"I don't do this kind of law, but I remember from law school that the burden of proving falsity is on the plaintiff. In a situation like this where the Wells report might or might not suggest cheating, and the Pats can come forward with evidence that might or might not suggest innocence, I really just don't think an action for defamation can lie. If it's debatable, unknown, or unprovable one way or another, then the plaintiff likely just hasn't carried his burden of proof."

I see equally ludicrous lawsuits on a regular basis that are simply ploys to weasel settlements out of companies whose lawyers make more money than is worth going to court over. Obviously this would be a higher profile case, and I agree defamation is a tough sell, but I'd also argue that many of the statements made by ESPN commentators after the league statements conflicted the originally leaked misinformation could be argued as intentional slander.  Just to keep the conversation interesting"
Patriots,3do70n,Hannibal_Montana,10,Fri Jul 17 22:22:20 2015 UTC,"Proving slander against a celebrity or public figure is incredibly difficult. That ESPN's statements were not exactly accurate would only go to show that they perhaps didn't adequately research the truth of the claims before stating them, which is one element of a slander claim. However, with cases involving a celebrity, you also have to prove that it was the explicit intent of ESPN to cause harm to Tom Brady when they released those statements, and that is very difficult and very unlikely given the multiple other reasons they could have plausibly had for releasing the info."
Patriots,3do70n,xchrisxsays,6,Fri Jul 17 22:38:05 2015 UTC,"You also have to PROVE that they KNEW that the statements were untrue, not just that they were untrue. Very difficult to do."

I'm just saying, being more aware of slander related  law than I ever intended on being, that I think TB has to be one of the better chances I've seen. Being a celebrity in this case also carries with it his promotional value as a marketable icon, which continued allegations of a tarnished legacy and zero acknowledgement of the inaccurate ""leak"" they spread, all after wave after wave of evidence was brought to the public by other sources, paints a picture of willful pattern of disregard for truth in favor of doing harm to Brady's public image, though I'll agree I can't name a single specific instance that on its own would stand as slander.   Like I said, not actually giving this serious credence, just fun to get fired up at those assclowns."

It's also different to be a red-blooded homer in the midst of other homers as opposed to harassing random fans at a bar.  I would classify /r/patriots as a probably a safe place for fans to speak uncensored.
Patriots,3dmmo0,itsNOSAJ,45,Fri Jul 17 14:34:30 2015 UTC,I know Danny has been a bit disappointing and has been overshadowed by jules but man did he make some big plays last season .
Patriots,3dmmo0,Shrodingers_sloth,43,Fri Jul 17 14:43:24 2015 UTC,Playoffs Amendola > Regular Amendola
Patriots,3dmmo0,jared2294,16,Fri Jul 17 15:02:22 2015 UTC,"It was fucking awesome how much he stepped up in the playoffs. Great for us fans, the organization and I especially him."
Patriots,3dmmo0,stinydanish,9,Fri Jul 17 16:18:08 2015 UTC,Steps up in the playoffs! He's our wide receiver version of Joe Flacco minus the unibrow.  ELITE! /s  I actually think Amendola stands to have much bigger numbers in 2015. He finally stayed healthy for a year -- if he can do it again (huge if) then with the rapport he seemed to develop with Brady he could start to put up some nice numbers. I feel better about our WR situation with the same guys now than I did last year. Winning a SB helps I guess.
Patriots,3dmmo0,Skippertech,5,Fri Jul 17 17:19:49 2015 UTC,"It seemed like he was getting into the game more too.. i dont know the numbers  Geez an offense where you can have Gronk, Chandler, Jules, Lafell and Dola as your recieving core... their would be teams around the league that would die for that"
Patriots,3dmmo0,ghostly5150,2,Fri Jul 17 19:39:52 2015 UTC,Sounds like the recipe for another record breaking season for TFB
Patriots,3dmmo0,-TG-,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:01:12 2015 UTC,Lafell taking that next step would bring the offense to a new level. I think he will step his game up this camp
Patriots,3dmmo0,2busy2blizzy,5,Sat Jul 18 19:36:19 2015 UTC,Amendola's real value is that he's the ultimate Julian Edelman replacement. Jules takes some massive fuckin hits and Amendola can pick up his role without missing a beat. He's practically worth his contract on that alone.
Patriots,3dmmo0,Theungry,8,Fri Jul 17 19:40:26 2015 UTC,"He was like an inverted Welker. Minimal regular season production, but made all the clutch plays in the post-season."
Patriots,3dmmo0,hampsted,3,Fri Jul 17 19:41:07 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I was gonna say. The anti-Welker! I'll take that any day.
Patriots,3dmmo0,alisonstone,2,Fri Jul 17 20:44:10 2015 UTC,"I think Amendola is really good in the regular season too, just that he didn't have a chance to show it. It's not like he ran the wrong routes, missed blocks, or dropped balls (LaFell getting flagged on the rub routes caused Amendola to lose a lot of stats). Brady just always looked to Gronk, Edelman, LaFell, and Vereen first. In the rare times where all those guys are covered and Brady targets Amendola, he usually executes, such as in this gif. Brady clearly looked right to Vereen first (Edelman wasn't deep enough to get a TD on a 3rd and goal, his role was most likely to draw Vereen's defender). Gronk and LaFell were the obvious red zone targets, but they were covered. Amendola was the last read and had the longest forming route. He wasn't anywhere close to the end zone by the time Brady had to start scrambling, so he wasn't the primary target, but Amendola beat his guy and caught a really difficult pass."
Patriots,3dmmo0,king0fklubs,11,Fri Jul 17 23:21:57 2015 UTC,Goddamn that catch and the one handed catch to Gronk were just too amazing. How Amendola repositions his body like that is beyond me.  I really like him in our offense and can't wait to see how he does next year.

Patriots,3dmmo0,Lowslowmk3,7,Fri Jul 17 15:21:03 2015 UTC,I know the throw was behind Danny but that was a hell of a read and play by Brady.
Patriots,3dmmo0,BostonBlackie,4,Fri Jul 17 16:02:51 2015 UTC,End of last year Amendola really impressed me. I went from hating him and his contract to really liking him. And now that he restructured and looking at the improved play from the tail end of last season I'm really excited for Amendola.
Patriots,3dmmo0,Theungry,4,Fri Jul 17 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"Ryan was asked after the game what cornerback Antonio Allen could have done to better defend the play.   ""No, I don't know, I have no idea--just the greatest route in the history of the game. I think we were shocked that on 3rd-and-goal from the 19 he would even run a route to the goal line."""

Patriots,3dmew3,TurkandJD,11,Fri Jul 17 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"I think the logic is that Jimmy's performance could have a major effect on the balance of power in the NFC, and perhaps the NFL.  If Graham brings it in Seattle, they're the runaway favorites to win the conference, and maybe even the Super Bowl.  If Graham gets lazy or soft, doesn't block, or doesn't click with Seattle's offense and their less effective QB, then it could become a dogfight between them and the Packers (and perhaps the Cowboys if they can do something similar to last season).  Gronk is more of a known quantity in their eyes.  He's going to be the best TE in the game and the Patriots offense is going to hammer people."
Patriots,3dmew3,QuagMeyer6791,9,Fri Jul 17 14:36:12 2015 UTC,"Even by that logic, GRONK has a major effect on the balance of power in the AFC.  A healthy GRONK probably doubles the Patriots' chances of reaching the Super Bowl."

Patriots,3dmm5m,itsNOSAJ,32,Fri Jul 17 14:30:07 2015 UTC,I am a big fan of not icing the kicker. Just gives them more time to get comfortable on the field in my opinion.  Sometimes kickers have to rush onto the field to make a kick and icing him just gives him time to prepare and not rush the attempt.
Patriots,3dmm5m,FancyBBQ,6,Fri Jul 17 14:54:41 2015 UTC,"Totally agree, I think there's a stat that they do better after 'icing'"
Patriots,3dmm5m,eaglessoar,3,Fri Jul 17 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think it's a horrible idea to ice kickers. However, I think its crucial to call a time-out early enough so that the kicker doesn't get a chance to kick a warm-up shot."
Patriots,3dmm5m,Dogdude351,17,Sat Jul 18 01:05:25 2015 UTC,"Granted it was a 58 yard attempt, so by no means a sure thing -- and longer kicks are easier to block.  Nick Folk's career long is 56 yards, and he has 3 other attempts from 56+ yards one of which was blocked, and the other two just missed.  Also interesting to remember a blocked FG (the Air Wilfork one) from 52 yard attempt also played into our other Jets win last season.  At exactly 50-51 yards, Folk is 11/15 ~ (73%).  At 52+ yards, he is 8/18 (~44%) counting this miss.    Data from football-reference"
Patriots,3dmm5m,djimbob,5,Fri Jul 17 15:54:01 2015 UTC,"Nick Folk's career long is 56 yards   I'm 98% sure they said his career long was 56 yards @Denver.  So you can take a few yards off that for every other stadium.  I'd fact check this but that means looking through Jets stats, so I'd rather just sit at work & do my job :)"
Patriots,3dmm5m,Mayor_Of_Onett,5,Fri Jul 17 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"Yes it was 56 yarder @Denver.  But he also had a 55 yarder at MetLife in NJ, 54 yarder in Foxboro and a 54-yarder in Carolina."
Patriots,3dmm5m,djimbob,12,Fri Jul 17 16:54:46 2015 UTC,surprised the refs didnt try and screw us on some BS penalty like they did the year before
Patriots,3dmm5m,zamboniman46,9,Fri Jul 17 16:53:10 2015 UTC,"If I remember right, there was a little complaining because you can see the ref tell one of the Patriots players to move back since he could be flagged for lining up over the long snapper.  But it really looks like he was planning to move back anyway once the defensive shift happened. The ref just kind of looks like he jumped the gun a little.  Edit: Sweet justice, anyway. Supposedly this was the game where the footballs were at 16psi."
Patriots,3dmm5m,spacecowboy007,7,Fri Jul 17 18:01:10 2015 UTC,"All the better that it was Jones, who was the specific player flagged on that bullshit the year before, who got the block on this one."

Patriots,3dmm5m,Kevin_Jim,11,Sat Jul 18 07:33:22 2015 UTC,BUT WHY DID THE REFEREE CORRECT HIGHTOWER WHEN HE WAS IN AN ILLEGAL FORMATION WAHHH
Patriots,3dmm5m,BURNEDandDIED,8,Fri Jul 17 16:42:26 2015 UTC,"Yknow I'm ok with refs doing this sort of thing, if a WR was lined up wide out and over the line I'd be fine with the ref saying hey buddy back up a bit. It's like a cop telling you to slow down a bit for going 5 over vs pulling you over. Yea technically you're breaking the law and he shouldn't help you skirt it but you're not there to catch people breaking the law you're there to keep people safe. Same with a ref, you're not there to catch people offsides or in illegal positions, you're there to make sure the game is played smoothly."
Patriots,3dmm5m,eaglessoar,3,Fri Jul 17 21:39:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was the complaint by some of the sports talking heads and the some Jets fans.  I think the play might have been designed that way because Hightower jumps back anyway once the shift happens. I think the ref was assuming too much."
Patriots,3dmm5m,spacecowboy007,2,Fri Jul 17 18:03:14 2015 UTC,Nailed it.  Jets fans have to bitch about something every game and attribute it to some conspiracy.
Patriots,3dmm5m,matt4pats,4,Fri Jul 17 22:55:38 2015 UTC,Poetic Justice for when Chris Jones got penalized for that stack formation on the Jets FG the year prior.
Patriots,3dmm5m,rover53,4,Fri Jul 17 19:09:39 2015 UTC,Motherfucking karma for that bullshit one year prior. Was so glad it was Chris Jones who got the block.  Fuck the Jets.
Patriots,3dmm5m,MrWigglesworth2,2,Sat Jul 18 00:38:52 2015 UTC,"I kept trying to figure out why they shifted right before the snap. I think it might be an attempt to trick the long snapper. When they set up, there's nobody over him. When he snaps the ball the entire defensive line is right over his spot. It was an attempt to catch him by surprise maybe?"
Patriots,3dmm5m,manmm,4,Fri Jul 17 14:31:59 2015 UTC,They shift like that in a attempt to draw the O line offside. It's a way way to track on five yards to a kick.
Patriots,3dmm5m,ctpatsfan77,2,Fri Jul 17 16:17:39 2015 UTC,"Not the LS (since you still can't have anyone line up directly over the LS), but the rest of the line."

Patriots,3dpmrr,Migoozioo,2,Sat Jul 18 12:42:32 2015 UTC,"This is easy:   (Best): SEA v. NE Hands down the best, Brady wasn't flawless, but had the best fourth quarter of his life, accomplishing something no other team in Superbowl history had been able to do, come back from a ten point fourth quarter deficit to win.  STL v NE A great game because Brady came in that season as the backup quarterback. An awesome last minute drive on the arm of Brady put them in field goal range, allowing Vinateri to boot one through the uprights and give New England its first Superbowl. CAR v NE Kind of boring at parts during the first quarter, but the fourth quarter exploded into a frenzy of activity, but once again Brady got Vinateri in range in the fourth quarter to seal the deal for the second Superbowl in three years.  PHI v NE Another intense shootout that ended with a big defensive play to secure back to back Superbowl wins. NYG vs. NE in Superbowl XLII: Brady did a good job in this Superbowl. Maybe not as well as in earlier bowls or in XLIX, but a good job. A colossal defensive implosion, both in the pass rushing and secondary department, let Brady down, giving New England their first Superbowl loss, and denying them perfection not seen in 35 years. NE v NYG II Just an unremarkable superbowl, one that, if you're not a giants fan, you probably forgot about, and store in that part of your brain where you keep the Packers-Steelers Superbowl or Marshawn Lynch touchdown celebrations."
Patriots,3dp8c4,BostonFatGuy,3,Sat Jul 18 03:17:11 2015 UTC,"Then, of course, are the other running backs. Brandon Bolden will get nothing more than special teams playing time this year.   Every year, writers say this. And every year, we end up glad we had the depth. The writer even mentions that BB just gave BB a contract extension in January, then asks if he might be cut in camp. The Patriots clearly prioritize special teams. We have the leagues highest paid kicker, drafted a long snapper, Matthew Slater is on a 4-year Pro Bowl streak, etc. etc. Keeping a guy like Bolden who plays great special teams and can run and catch out of the backfield moderately well seems like a no brainer."

Patriots,3dndo7,bjb406,12,Fri Jul 17 18:00:57 2015 UTC,"Bills and Jets could be a coin flip. I wouldn't say that Houston is easy. In all likelihood, we face a 4-2 Dolphins in Foxboro."
Patriots,3dndo7,RobbyJohnson,7,Fri Jul 17 18:11:45 2015 UTC,4-2 Dolphins vs. 6-0 Pats.  I like the odds.
Patriots,3dndo7,enbentz,2,Fri Jul 17 19:54:52 2015 UTC,I like our odds anytime we're in Foxboro.
Patriots,3dndo7,RobbyJohnson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:33:19 2015 UTC,"This seems accurate. We havent won in Foxboro since 08. If RobbyJohnson's scenario plays out, Tannehill getting his first win up north would be a career defining event."

Patriots,3dndo7,livinlifeontheedge,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:49:18 2015 UTC,"granted, but if that's the toughest team you are facing through 6 games that's pretty crazy"
Patriots,3dndo7,2busy2blizzy,9,Fri Jul 17 21:43:09 2015 UTC,Bills Jets and Texans are all more than capable of beating Miami.
Patriots,3dndo7,rover53,4,Fri Jul 17 18:20:10 2015 UTC,I could see them eating shit against the Redskins somehow.  That's why they play the games.
Patriots,3dndo7,mattsparrow,2,Fri Jul 17 19:14:27 2015 UTC,"Houston arent a pushover (just having Watt and Wilfork will pretty much force the dolphins into being one dimensional). The Bills and Jets may be able to squeak out a win, and for all we know WAS JAX and TEN might improve or pull off an upset.  The Dolphins are king of losing games they should win."

Patriots,3dndo7,ImperialStorm,2,Fri Jul 17 21:08:34 2015 UTC,"They've struggled with Buffalo for awhile and the Jets have pulled off numerous upsets against the dolphins throughout history. Houston is underrated as hell and no one knows how Mariota's mobility can affect the Titans overall offense. They could go 3-3 after all we are talking about Philbin's ""shit the bed at the last minute"" coaching here."

They can go ahead and start believing their own hype and drop out in the second half of the season"
Patriots,3dndo7,McLyan,-1,Sat Jul 18 15:11:10 2015 UTC,"Jj watt sucks, most overrated player in the NFL next to revis.  The highlight of watts year is going to the probowl. I can't see them going to the playoffs with such a shitty offense. sb 49 showed that the #1 defense in the NFL doesnt always win.. Even tho they pretty much dominated before.. They've never played against tom clutch brady. Having wilfork and watt won't save houston.  I don't even know who theyre quarterback is he can't be that good."
Patriots,3dndo7,TheMagicianDolph,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:49:18 2015 UTC,JJ Watt doesn't suck but at the end of the day he's a DE. QB is the most important position in football. Fitz had more to do with the 9-7 season than Watt. He had a great year the year before and they went 2-14.
Patriots,3dn9o7,agentsmith907,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:31:08 2015 UTC,Was Bill in the control room?  They cut him off just as he was starting to go classic Gronk on Deflategate

Patriots,3dn0jx,starfoxer,2,Fri Jul 17 17:42:15 2015 UTC,"Shit I'd throw him a camp invite at this point. Couldnt be worse than Ochocinco even at his age. Brady could use a savvy guy in that part time #4 WR role...If Dobson doesnt bring it in camp, and Wayne looks like a contributor, he definitely could have a decent impact in that #4 --25 catch 200 yards and come up big when needed (just like Dola in the post season last year)"
Patriots,3dn0jx,KissTheRings617,2,Sat Jul 18 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"Well we definitely wouldn't have to lean on him much at WR. If cheap, I'd have no problem with it only because I'm not sure how else we are going to spend that $10m in cap space right now."
Patriots,3dn0jx,The_Jolly_Dog,6,Fri Jul 17 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"We wont spend the cap space. We never spend all of it. We'll need it for mid-season acquisitions, incentives, and we'll roll over what we dont use.  Like we do every year."
Patriots,3dn0jx,swantonsoup,2,Fri Jul 17 17:04:27 2015 UTC,Might need that money to make up for the lost draft picks.
Patriots,3dn0jx,pulsepulsebeep,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:19:55 2015 UTC,Sure - but do we typically carry $10m going into a season? (I honestly don't know) Still seems like a good chance we would end the season with cash to spend
Patriots,3dn0jx,The_Jolly_Dog,2,Fri Jul 17 17:07:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, $10m is in line with how we manage the cap. I forget what we rolled over from last year but I think it was like $6-7 after we paid incentives and such."
Patriots,3dn0jx,swantonsoup,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:20:21 2015 UTC,I believe the typical amount is around 6-7m. The current amount is definitely more than usual. Also have to consider that there is a possibility of signing some guys early who are coming close to their last year of their rookie contracts.
Patriots,3dn0jx,lordmadone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:27:53 2015 UTC,"Also, isn't NE still short of meeting that weird required average annual spending threshold over the last few years? It's like those speed minimum signs on the highway and teams have to spend at least an average of X% of the cap or they'd be subject to penalties."
Patriots,3dn0jx,TruthorTroll,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:26:52 2015 UTC,"Also, isn't NE still short of meeting that weird required average annual spending threshold over the last few years?   I believe the way they spent in the off-season, they were able to get up to par with that."
Patriots,3dn0jx,lordmadone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:59:42 2015 UTC,BB always leaves a good amount of money for mid season acquisitions and also for extra cap space next year.
Patriots,3dn0jx,bigsten15,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:18:10 2015 UTC,"Save it for signing Hightower, Collins, and Jones next year."
Patriots,3dn0jx,tundrawolf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:03 2015 UTC,Reggie Wayne is pretty much cooked.  Worst case he is a good camp body and can help teach young kids.  I dont think he'll make the team.  But if injuries happen and he's still FA he could come in.
Patriots,3dn0jx,MasterofMarionettes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:28:28 2015 UTC,"Eh, why not? It shouldn't take too much to sign him. Give him a try in the Pre-season at least."
Patriots,3dn0jx,Joke65,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:07:25 2015 UTC,"Didn't we have him around for a physical this offseason? Maybe that was one of the 657 CBs we were looking at, or it was a Reiss speculation, but I thought there'd already been word of us looking into him."
Patriots,3doaq8,flyingpotato408,4,Fri Jul 17 22:13:02 2015 UTC,I live in St. Louis and the Pats have only had 1 away game against the Rams in about a decade.  And it was played in London.

Patriots,3doaq8,ghostly5150,3,Fri Jul 17 22:52:19 2015 UTC,I just mentioned this to my future brother in law (a bay area native and stadium-brick owning die hard 9er fan).

Patriots,3doaq8,afxjzs,2,Sat Jul 18 00:40:44 2015 UTC,Nice!!   Yeah I'm super stoked
Patriots,3doly9,GGerrik,3,Fri Jul 17 23:49:29 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. He was a talented back, but not game changing. It sucks, but I'm okay with the way things turned out."

Patriots,3doly9,DoritoSlayer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:31:09 2015 UTC,"I mean we only got to see one year out of him and it was a productive year. Usually things get better, though I suppose he could've gone the way of the Muscle Hamster (even without the injury).   He could have been the Edge to our Brady and what might that have done for the team's through the dynasty, Brady's legacy? Would the teams have been better?"

I don't know about team friendly sections - if you can find one, definitely go that route. I haven't been to a Pats game in Denver for few years now but, in my experience, Denver fans tend to be horrible.   Both Patriots games I have been to, either me or someone I was with had beer poured on them at least once (obviously some heckling - also drunks trying to start fights). I went to the Chiefs game this year and I didn't see that stuff going on so maybe they have cracked down on the assholes."
Patriots,3dnsyk,The_Scrub,2,Fri Jul 17 20:40:05 2015 UTC,"Yea, that's what I'm worried about.  I can deal some heckling.  But I'm what most people consider short tempered.

He has been working hard, has had the best coach/qb in history working with him.  The only times we have seen him play he has done VERY well (even if they weren't the most meaningful snaps, teams don't just stop playing, it's still not easy to make completions in the NFL).  He may be untested, but compared to other backups I think he is easily in the top four.  Not to mention Bellichick is probably the best coach at drafting QB's, and I thought he got another winner here."

I get that he hasn't played long enough to get a great idea of his potential, but we can only judge him based on what we've seen which is, quite honestly, extremely impressive. He played better than Brady in both the Chiefs and Bills game.  He has a long way to go, but I wouldn't take anyone on this list over him right now."

Patriots,3dhyvv,mcorcoran3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:16:08 2015 UTC,I think this year Mason is going to take over Fleming's role as the extra TE in jumbo packages (ppl are greatly discounting Fleming in the camp battle at guard). He needs a lot of development in pass blocking but BB said he was probably the best run blocker in the draft. That jumbo package role is perfect for him even though it's generally a T out there.

Patriots,3dio0x,patsfans,76,Thu Jul 16 16:09:16 2015 UTC,"From the article:   The NFL policy for handling equipment in the NFL is in the club manual and pertains to club personnel, not players. The NFLPA would argue that the NFL suspended Brady four games under a policy that doesn’t apply to him. The Wells Report, the investigation on which the NFL based its suspension, alleged Brady was “at least generally aware” that footballs had been tampered. The NFLPA would argue that the “general awareness” standard has no legal merit – either Wells found direct evidence, or he didn’t. The NFLPA would argue Brady – given the rules in the club manual did apply to him – received a punishment without precedence. Under the collective bargaining agreement, players have a right to know specific punishment for specific violations. The NFLPA plans to cite a specific example in oral arguments in an effort to prove Brady’s suspension was arbitrary. Last year, the league caught the Minnesota Vikings tampering with footballs by placing them in a dryer, a violation of the club manual. The team, the NFLPA source said, received a letter from the league and no further reprimand. The NFLPA would mount an argument against the procedure the Wells Report used to measure the inflation and deflation of footballs, saying there was no previous standard."

I'd love for it to get to this point.  A federal judge letting them get into the weeds on the Wells Report is exactly what the reputation of this team needs.  I'm almost salivating for the opinion."

For not fully cooperating with the investigation by not turning over he cell phone and email, Tom Brady will be fined $500,000 dollars.""  Shitty part:  The Pats will still lose draft picks ""because of deflategate"" even if that happens, so deflategate being real will become like spygate being about illegally filming defensive signals, total bullshit but the narrative that remains thanks to ESPN and fans who can't read."

Clearly Brady does not need the money, he is after restoring his reputation which has been decimated through this ""scandal.""    Actually this might be in Goodell's favor that this was released before hand.  Now he can reduce the suspension to 1 game and make himself seem like he is merciful in the public eye, only to have Brady say it is not good enough and take him to court."
Patriots,3dio0x,par016,3,Thu Jul 16 17:21:34 2015 UTC,"I've been really worried about the possibility of a reduction down to a single game. Brady doesn't need the money, but he does love playing football for the pure love of the game. I want him fully exonerated more than anything, but I could also see him taking a one game suspension if Goodell were to offer it as punishment for failure to cooperate rather than for having any involvement in the alleged deflation of footballs. It would still be a bullshit punishment, but it would put Brady back on the field sooner, does no damage to his legacy since he's not being punished for cheating anymore, and let's Goodell keep some face as a disciplinarian.   If it's two or more games, I think Brady takes it to court no matter what and he wins. So for once I'm hoping Goodell is as pigheaded as ever so Brady's team gets to destroy him in court."
Patriots,3dio0x,OneMoreLaura,2,Thu Jul 16 17:44:39 2015 UTC,"If Goodell reduces the suspension to one game on appeal, that won't go away if Brady takes it to court and loses; at that point Brady can't get any suspension worse than one game.  There's no equivalent to the plea deal (unless its done via back channels via your word).   While Brady's in court contesting the suspension, he won't be suspended.  He can't go on the exempt list (which was designed to suspend players with pay while external criminal proceedings like domestic violence, child abuse, etc are going on)."
Patriots,3dio0x,djimbob,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"But if he's loses in court (and I don't think he will) but if he did, he might have to serve that suspension at a critical point late in the season. Or worse, the playoffs if it takes that long to get to court.  What's best for Brady's legacy is to fight this thing through whether it be one game or four.  What would be best for the team would be to get it out of the way early in the season and then just focus on playing football.  I don't want to see Brady fall on his sword. I want to see him play all four quarters leading that epic final drive into the endzone (since he does it soooo well.) But he has always been a team first guy, and I'm worried he might take a single game suspension if offered to him."

They may not want to talk to reporters about it (because the questions about legacy are always idiotic or make you sound pompous -- how does it feel being so great at football?), but they care.  Brady will fight it and BB will support the effort.  And if its reduced to 1-2 games, it seems unlikely it will get settled right before a playoff game.

Patriots,3dio0x,RealTock,10,Thu Jul 16 16:48:36 2015 UTC,"The Rodgers aspect really is not the same thing at all.  The Patriots are being accused of tampering after inspection, Rodgers admitted to overinflating before inspection.  It just doesn't apply here."
Patriots,3dio0x,par016,3,Thu Jul 16 17:17:32 2015 UTC,"Well Rodgers said he did it before the inspection. But we all know that calling yourself the ""inflator"" is conclusive proof of inflating footballs after the refs inspect."
Patriots,3dio0x,okthrowaway2088,2,Thu Jul 16 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"It does apply if you consider it as a knock on the NFL's pregame ball-handling protocol. Clearly no one is taking real measurements if Rodgers has gotten over inflated balls into NFL games. I don't think it has too much merit in a court room, but if it has happened even one single time, then thats as bad a move by the refs as it would be for a team hypothetically tampering. If the balls aren't even correct going into the game, and the refs aren't capable of ensuring they are, then the NFL is 100% to blame."
Patriots,3dio0x,PatricksPub,3,Thu Jul 16 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"Sure it shows the lack of pre-game accountability on the refs but the original comment was talking about how Rodgers wasn't punished and comparing that to Brady's situation, nothing about pre-game protocol."

Patriots,3dio0x,Schekaiban,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:38:54 2015 UTC,"The fact that there wasn't a multi-million dollar investigation into the Packers shows bias. The Patriots balls were supposedly deflated, so the league launched an investigation. Rodgers admitted that the Packers balls are over-inflated and the league let it pass with no investigation. If this is a black man vs white man or male vs female issue, it would be a slam dunk discrimination lawsuit.  When someone representing the league jokes about over-inflated footballs (ironically, during the Packers vs Patriots game too) and everybody laughs it off. If a company shows a long history of not caring about a certain rule, and then chooses to enforce that rule only when black employees (or insert whatever minority group) violate it, that's an easy argument for discrimination."
Patriots,3dio0x,alisonstone,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"there's plenty of unfairness in the NFL w.r.t Pats punishments. This isn't one of them. Rodgers said he likes to submit overinflated balls before inspection to see if they are approved. Brady is being accused of a conspiracy to tamper with balls after the inspection. Regardless of how shitty the investigation or pre-game procedures are, these are two different things. Bringing up this point makes Pats fans look uninformed and biased.  There's PLENTY of shit to point out, for instance:  - the NFL officials overinflated one of Brady's balls to 16 PSI before a Jets game demonstrates that the NFL has never cared about air pressure (and why should it, really?)  - the Colts emailed the NFL before the AFC Championship to say that they thought the Pats might try deflating the balls. The NFL basically ignored the email, saying that they didn't take it seriously  - the refs said that the ball guy taking the balls without him had never happened before and that the ref said it was the first time he'd lost sight of the balls out of all of the games he's ref'd. the security guards disagreed and said that was actually pretty normal to do. Even still, imagine you're the ref and (you claim) that you've never lost control of the balls in any games before this. Given that this is (supposedly) SUPER irregular AND you were tipped off about potential tampering, why wouldn't you re-check those balls?  - the refs cannot remember which of the two air pressure gauges they used to test air pressure (yes, the two gauges disagreed nontrivially because they were not frequently calibrated, presumably because the NFL has never cared about air pressure readings before this). In fact, if we trust the ref's memory, then the air pressure readings for the Pats's balls actually CAN be accounted for by the cold weather. The Wells Report decides that even though they trust the refs memory for everything else, the ref must be wrong on which gauge was used, and the report then uses this to show that the balls must have been tampered with  - the Colts illegally stuck a gauging needle into the ball on the sidelines after the interception. No warnings, fines, or penalties were given.  - some of the Colts balls were measured by the officials during halftime. Using one of the gauges, 3/4 of the measured balls were found to be under 12.5 PSI. Why weren't all 12 Colts balls measured? The refs cite that they ran out of time (or perhaps they didn't like the baseline results they were getting which were showing that it wasn't anomalous for the Pats's balls to be under 12.5). Either way, running out of time means that they probably measured all 12 Pats balls THEN as many Colts balls as they could, which meant that the Colts balls probably got more time to begin adjusting to the indoor heat and regaining some amount of air pressure back.   etc."

Our receivers and TE's are elite at getting open on short routes and of course Brady has 99 awareness.    Vereen's role on this play was apparently to first pick up a weak side blitz, but otherwise to run a route into the flats. You can see a hesitation in his route as he determines if the the LB is blitzing.  It's almost a cat and mouse game as the LB does give the impression of a blitz at first. Just something small that you can see on these great replays that you might not notice in real time."

Patriots,3dig77,break_yo_self,21,Thu Jul 16 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"CT sports fandom and culture is split essentially by the area code:   The 203, chiefly Greenwich/Stamford/Westport are just NYC suburbs - quite literally most of the people that live out there are NYC expats who made a boatload of money and wanted a bigger house in the 'burbs. But I have found in general the 203 tends ot be more sympathetic to NY and its sports teams than the 860.  The 860 is more evenly split, but is dominated by Giant and Pats, with very little Jets support. The area around Hartford - where I am from - is about 55/45 Pats I would say but it increases in Pats fandom as you approach the Mass border (obv).  Additionally, as someone who hails form the 860 I absolutely despise the fact that the 203 seems to be the figurehead of what people think CT is. All my friends from out of state, especially those from the south and the west, assume all of CT is just like Fairfield County, which is total shit. I hate the rich entitled expats from NYC just as much as you all do in Rhode Island, trust me."

You hit the nail on the head with your description of the 203.  It's a large majority of douche nozzles whose wealthy parents have box seats to Jets and Giants games at the Meadowlands or nice tickets at Yankees Stadium.  Being a Boston sports fan here is tough.  It's frustrating because people around where I live ask me why do I root for Boston teams, we're only an hour away from the city.  Then we have Massholes and the rest of New England claiming they don't want a CT fanbase because they think we're all fair weather fans or only partially invested.  It's bullshit, there are a good deal of people down here who fucking hate New York sports, such as myself."
Patriots,3dig77,Plutor,10,Thu Jul 16 15:52:18 2015 UTC,I feel like even 203 is two separate worlds. The South and West corner can be described as wealthy NYC suburbs. But the North? Danbury? Waterbury? Meriden? No way. Even New Haven for the most part is too far away from New York to really be infected.
Patriots,3dig77,rover53,2,Thu Jul 16 16:40:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, I'm not sure how fandom is split up by Danbury.  My guess is that it's still very much New York sports territory."

THIS. I am a native Rhode Islander of the south coast. That means every summer, including right now (today) there a billion people from the far west of CT (Stamford/Greenwich) who work in NYC, come over here to their $2 million beach homes and parade around like assholes all summer. Growing up my dad ran a boat/car upholstery business and these millionaire fuckers would always show up starting in June and either try to get everything done for $50 or literally run off (by taking their boat back home) without ever paying for completed work. My personal experiences with their behavior is even worse, entire bags of trash thrown in front of my house (magazine labels were from Western, CT). Hell, one of them threw a bag of McDonalds on my street while my dad was behind them once. He stopped, picked it up, followed them to their beach house and threw it in their driveway. This is what we deal with all the time!  Now, I realize not all of Connecticut is these people. I live 25 minutes from CT border and spend a lot of time in New London County, these aren't the tourists swarming us and it appears 90% of them are Pats fans. The eastern half of the state also tends to behave like actual New Englanders, publicly reserved, respectful, keep to themselves etc.   I think it's the small subset of rich assholes from the far west that grates my state in particular and leads the majority of Rhode Islanders grouping all of you together, unfortunately. It doesn't help that this same group are all Giants/Jets fans due to their NYC lives, hell, they even get the NYC Metro in their neighborhoods.  In short, I do view Connecticut as part of New England, but I think the Connecticut River is a dividing line between more New England ""type"" attitudes, culture and sports affiliations and a more NYC set of attitudes, affiliation and wealth."

He didn't complain about the meal, but tried to get it comped by my manager after he had paid (and took leftovers home), guy got loaded off of 2 drinks and embarrassed the shit out of his late-teens-early-twenties son by yelling at his wife in the dining room.

Being a diehard Boston sports fan here blows.  The split is about 70/30, with 70% being New York sports fans, and 30% Boston sports fans.  With this comes a great deal of people who root for certain Boston teams like the Patriots but will also root for the Rangers, Knicks, and Yankees, which is arguably worse.  We're the only county in New England that does not get NESN, and therefore people are even more inclined to root for NY teams because the Boston sports teams aren't even on television on a regular basis. My point is, STOP HATING ON CT PATS FANS. We deal with a lot of shit from NY sports fans who gush about the Yankees 27 world series wins or how Eli and the Giants are the only team in the NFL to have our number, and they have it in the worse possible way.  The Boston fans living in this area are as diehard as it gets.  We put up with a whole lot of shit and will never give in because fuck New York sports, fuck the Yankees, fuck the Giants, fuck the Jets, fuck Mark Teixeira, fuck Gay-Roid, fuck Bart Scott, fuck Antonio Cromartie, and fuck Brett Gardner that bald little midget piece of shit.

Patriots,3dig77,War_Daddy,2,Fri Jul 17 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"Because your list is stupid. Unless you live 5 minutes from those landmarks I could say my five reasons would be that CT residents live closer to NYC which kicks Boston's ass in every category you listed other than maybe ivy league status.   Moreover, CT has many of the things you listed and in higher quantities than other NE states. We have an ivy league school. We have at that school one of the better art museums in the country. We used to have one of the more beloved pro sports teams in the region and have many minor league teams throughout our state. Your examples are not representative of what makes NE states other than CT amazing, it's what makes living in a large metropolitan city amazing.  So let's play your game, without naming things in Boston, name five things that makes your state better than CT or the other NE states."

Patriots,3diy30,SantosSays,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:39:41 2015 UTC,There is probably a pre-set time that Gronk is able to stay signing books. Goodwill probably not as important to the store as selling as many books as possible within that given timeframe.   The thing I dislike about this is the no personalization rule. This is so easy to do right without any additional hassle. One staffer takes down names on post-it notes. You hand your post-it to the publicist beofore you reach the table. They stick it to the title page of the book that she/he eventually hands to Gronkowski. Its an extra few seconds of work and a way cooler memento for the book buyer.

I couldn't get a pair of Nike's to last me even a week. After going through four pairs of gloves, I came across these cutters that had locking finger protection and never looked back.   Now, as for cleats, fit is most important. And be sure to choose the best ones for your position (lineman cleats are heavier but offer more protection, WR cleats are smaller, lighter and faster). And finally, I recommend choosing your cleats dependent on the surfaces you'll play on. For example, I've found molded bottoms better on that fake turf grass, but removable was my preference for grass fields."

Patriots,3dixjt,MaigoULTD,2,Thu Jul 16 21:48:47 2015 UTC,"That looks like the remaining list, with Ty Law (as mentioned below).  Personally, I wouldn't have put Matt Light that high, especially above some of the players 12-20, but it's all just opinion anyway.  Good list."
Patriots,3dixjt,HateSleepingAloneeee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:48:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's fair to have one of those OLs top 10, and it's gonna be him if anyone. I still think moss deserved top 10 though, although not sure who I'd bump."
Patriots,3dixjt,AmericanFartBully,3,Thu Jul 16 18:06:34 2015 UTC,"I know he only thought of 49 Players. Looking at the list, and the players listed by rska884 as who is left. I would have just added Ted Washington at 49 and push everyone else down one. He came in for one year like Brian Waters. Helped Shore up the middle of our defensive line and helped win the Super Bowl. He was gone the next year with Bill drafting Vince."
Patriots,3dixjt,eleven8ster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:24:36 2015 UTC,That would've been a good fix. Bledsoe would've been good too in the late 40s.
Patriots,3dixjt,mcorcoran3,2,Thu Jul 16 18:35:12 2015 UTC,Wilfork has to be in the top 5. I would say the top 5 consists of:   Brady Vinatieri Gronk Wilfork Bruschi.
Patriots,3dixjt,mcorcoran3,2,Fri Jul 17 04:05:26 2015 UTC,"Ted Johnson should be higher than Moss, especially if this is just going by career contribution.   I mean, I can understand why people'd want to over look him, but..."

Patriots,3dixjt,droid6,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:27:56 2015 UTC,"I don't get 24...  I made a top 20 list based on this awhile back. I think Law was my #2 guy with Troy Brown up there high as well. It is very hard to make these lists -- so many good players. So before you critique Curran or anyone else, I urge you to just try and make a top 10 list -- you would be amazed at who you leave out."
Patriots,3dixjt,Dogdude351,2,Thu Jul 16 18:12:14 2015 UTC,"Wasn't critiquing him, just offering my thoughts. It's definitely tough and all an opinion based exercise anyway.  On 24, I was poking fun at him. If you look at his post for it, you'll see he did the same. No hard feelings or criticism intended here."
Patriots,3dg8j0,kneedragatl,37,Thu Jul 16 00:57:31 2015 UTC,He is a Seahawks fan so it shouldn't hurt them too much

Patriots,3dg8j0,therealshaqfu,2,Thu Jul 16 04:30:21 2015 UTC,he looks bitter... not like he's smiling and going along with the joke
Patriots,3dg8j0,Ferrrrrrrrrrrrrrrari,20,Thu Jul 16 05:15:46 2015 UTC,No sex and God talking to him all the time makes him a bit tense.
Patriots,3dg8j0,2big_2fail,3,Thu Jul 16 06:01:56 2015 UTC,The fact that he was there participating in the monologue indicates he was going along with the joke.
Patriots,3dg8j0,rosinthebow,2,Thu Jul 16 14:51:33 2015 UTC,He has to look bitter for the joke to be funny. Russell Wilson is way more important to the ESPYs than Joel McHale so if he didn't want to do the bit it wouldn't have happened.
Patriots,3dg8j0,drodin,2,Thu Jul 16 15:37:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't watch the ESPY last night but I just watched it an hour ago and I understand now. From this GIF it made it look like it was unscripted, but watching the full thing it was definitely scripted."
Patriots,3djhf3,loveandhatenfl,2,Thu Jul 16 19:42:17 2015 UTC,"No team runs exclusively either.  Especially not us.  Take two classic plays we run  1) The hurry up stretch play, you know the one, where we hurry to the line and then run outside from a quick snap.  That's a zone play.  Like this one  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYqBvZhW2jQ  2) The short pull play.  That is likely more a man blocking scheme.  Like this one  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLIc1BnhdNw  A lot of blocking schemes are hybrids now anyway with various rules applying in given circumstances.  It's not really a huge deal though"

Patriots,3djhf3,swantonsoup,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:44:27 2015 UTC,First video is outside zone the 2nd video is power
Patriots,3djhf3,dekremneeb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:31:18 2015 UTC,yes? Outside zone is still a zone play and power is a short pull play which often uses man concepts?
Patriots,3djhf3,2busy2blizzy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:34:29 2015 UTC,It wouldn't make sense because he's a guard over 30 we'd have to pay top  dollar for.  It has nothing to do with the scheme. We have so much youth at the position we already might have a better line than the one we win the SB with and you want to pay big bucks for an old guard?  Nah. It's a bad move for a lot of reasons outside of scheme. Also mankins plaited like 2 games at T in 13 so I have no idea what that's about.
Patriots,3djhf3,2busy2blizzy,2,Thu Jul 16 19:56:31 2015 UTC,"First, I wasn't looking to argue about this, I wanted information on our scheme. Second, I think an all-pro guard for ~5-6mm is very reasonable, even if our younger players are good it's pretty unlikely they play at that level.   Yes, Mankins played only a few games at LT. The article I was referring to suggests that we switched for the Ravens game: https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2013/12/25/patriots-adjustment-ground-game-flattened-ravens/m0QHckIWOk11h3Pz2iLJpN/story.html"

Patriots,3dgfxr,yalemartin,5,Thu Jul 16 02:11:05 2015 UTC,"If you don't ignore the context, then you aren't actually identifying the best play of the year. Because only about half the teams in the NFL/NBA/NHL/MLB played games with a context that would make them eligible.  Did you want the best play of the year or did you want the best play made in an important game?  To answer your question, yes, OBJ's catch was drastically superior to Butler's interception."

Patriots,3dgfxr,TruthorTroll,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:37:25 2015 UTC,We should be counting practices then too... and street games while we're at it.   Context may not be everything but it can't be ignored either...

I don't want to take anything away from a very nice (and timely) read he made, but that wasn't even one of the top five most impressive interceptions of the year.  Only when you add context does that play become memorable."
Patriots,3dgfxr,abmmm,-1,Fri Jul 17 12:08:37 2015 UTC,"No, you're missing the context. The Patriots didn't win every award so I'm going to come on here and act like a pussy and cry about it."
Patriots,3dgfxr,Notorious300,2,Fri Jul 17 02:37:17 2015 UTC,I try never to pay attention to espn or nfl.com anymore. They never give the Pats the respect they most def deserve. If the Steelers won the Super bowl it would still be on tv now.
Patriots,3dgfxr,2big_2fail,6,Thu Jul 16 03:18:08 2015 UTC,Ignore it all... ESPN would love folks arguing about it.  History decides great plays and the moment matters.  ODB's catch doesn't even happen without today's synthetic and tactified gloves.  Integrity... it's laughable.
Patriots,3dgfxr,bridgecrewdave,2,Thu Jul 16 03:27:37 2015 UTC,Espn is gonna gobble objs cocktail until he's not marketable anymore. Gronk made a similar catch the same week and no one cared. Fuck obj.
Patriots,3dgfxr,ihateconnecticut,2,Thu Jul 16 02:54:55 2015 UTC,"It was 3 weeks prior (Gronk week 9, OBJ week 12) and Gronk's was labelled as the best catch of the season at that point."
Patriots,3dgfxr,PhallusaurusRex,4,Thu Jul 16 12:30:02 2015 UTC,"ODBs catch was the most athletic and ridiculous. Remove context from both and look at the catches for what they are.  Looks like the interpretation of Best catch for this years award focuses on the catch itself and not the context.   And finally, we won the fucking Superbowl. Who the Fuck cares?  Especially if it's an award show hosted by a shitty ass ""sports"" network. Fuck ESPN and don't bother giving them attention."
Patriots,3dgfxr,MoistWalrus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:27:20 2015 UTC,"Just looking at the plays without the context, OBJ is the winner  His catch definitely involved more skill and looked more appealing to viewers.

Patriots,3dgfxr,wickedrude,9,Thu Jul 16 12:35:39 2015 UTC,"""Without context""? Then why judge a play at all? Context is EVERYTHING. A play that wins a Championship is without a doubt a better play than a meaningless catch in a game all New Yorkers conveniently forget the Giants actually lost."
Patriots,3dgfxr,MoistWalrus,5,Thu Jul 16 02:53:02 2015 UTC,Context shouldn't matter when talking about the difficulty of the play and athletic it was.
Patriots,3dgfxr,TheMagicianDolph,2,Thu Jul 16 03:11:24 2015 UTC,"A no pressure catch that ultimately had no effect on the Giants season?   Or an int, inches from the goalline, with less than 30 seconds to go? This  changed the trajectory of NFL history. This was a tougher play than OBJ."
Patriots,3dgfxr,okthrowaway2088,2,Thu Jul 16 03:20:14 2015 UTC,"Plus, Butler only gets 1 chance to make that play. Beckham had a ton of chances to make a great catch on a long throw.  But it's the ESPYs, so the real answer is that we should just not be watching or caring about the crap that ESPN puts out."
Patriots,3dgfxr,mcorcoran3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:51:18 2015 UTC,Context almost always matters with this award -- look at past winners.

Patriots,3dgfxr,wickedrude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:29:54 2015 UTC,"So without context, a great catch in a PRACTICE would be as eligible for this award? Give me a break. When the season is on the line, when the pressure to perform is at its highest, when Champions rise to seize the moment; that MUST count for something. In that vein, I was extremely dismayed that Lebron won the ""Championship Performance"" category, when he (along with the rest of his team) simply gave up with five minutes to go in their last game. Brady wasn't even nominated, which is also mystifying. By any empirical measurement, his performance in the 4th quarter of the Super Bowl was one for the ages, especially against that defense. ESPN's bias really shows here."
Patriots,3dgfxr,sugar_free_haribo,2,Thu Jul 16 03:32:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe but Butler made the greatest play in sports history. Seriously, there is no comparison. Swinging the win probability from 90% one way to 100% the other way on the last real play of the game. It's difficult to even contrive such a scenario in other sports. Add to that the stakes of that game and the insane storylines and it has to fucking win the espy. IT'S THE GREATEST SPORTS PLAY OF ALL TIME."
Patriots,3dgfxr,ukez,2,Thu Jul 16 18:29:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly! People will forever remember the Butler INT. It will be a part of both Patriots and Super Bowl lore for eternity. In a list 50 years from now of greatest sports plays, it will be up there. People will forget about OBJ's catch in a year or two, guaranteed."
Patriots,3dgfxr,_funtime,2,Thu Jul 16 04:02:21 2015 UTC,"While it was a great sports play for sure, I'm not so sure about the greatest sports play ever. There is still the ridiculous David Tyree helmet catch in the 2007/8 Super Bowl. That one set up a SB winning drive for the Giants. Context and insane difficulty."

Patriots,3de3mi,OpieTheReposter,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:54:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the factors are all there: youth, great defense, dominant running game, and a smart QB who makes plays. Also, in this age of parity, having a team win two consecutive Superbowls may be the closest thing you can get to a dynasty. However, I am more inclined to define a dynasty as a period of prolonged success marked by several championship wins, appearances, and the threat of always competing for one. So the Pats, Spurs, UConn Women's basketball, the Chicago Blackhawks, are examples of what I would consider dynasty teams. If the Seahawks are competitive for another ten years, win another Super Bowl, and appear in another, I'd say they are worthy of the moniker. But I think you are right in saying a second championship wouldn't make them a dynasty immediately."

Right when they won he shouted, shot up off his chair and high fived me and my and brother. He was on the verge of tears. He had been a diehard Red Sox fan his whole life, was at one of the games of the '75 WS, and his father was a diehard Sox fan his entire life until he passed away in 2001.

Patriots,3deq1z,jotch,2,Thu Jul 16 12:59:12 2015 UTC,A kicker in the 6th round? That seems like a waste. There's still so many capable WRs and RBs left to take. Even if they're the best kicker in the game they don't usually add as many points to a team as a WR3 or RB3.
Patriots,3deq1z,denvertebows15,2,Wed Jul 15 22:47:24 2015 UTC,A kicker in the 6th round is absurd -- by then you don't even have a third RB

Patriots,3deq1z,Marcurial,2,Wed Jul 15 20:14:35 2015 UTC,It depends on the scoring your league uses. Most leagues though I don't think getting a good kicker is that much of a difference maker. Especially if you're taking a kicker over someone who could pan out as a WR2/3 or a RB2/3. They'll give you more points than your kicker will week to week.

Patriots,3ddn1a,FantasyPls,6,Wed Jul 15 14:16:46 2015 UTC,If they pull that move Brady will ask for a temporary injunction. In other words if court happens Brady will get court order saying he can play until a court says otherwise or he gets suspended for another reason not related to the case.

I'm not very legal savvy, but I thought that since the NFL is a privately owned entity, they can essentially abide by their own rules and not need to answer to outside authority."
Patriots,3ddn1a,littlelionel10,2,Wed Jul 15 20:48:33 2015 UTC,"Employees gain their rights to collectively bargain from federal law. Thank god. Violations of those rights and violations of agreements made in collective bargaining are therefore federal cases.  There is a National Labor Relations Board that often hears grievances but the circumstance in this case and the structure of the league's CBA must not apply.  Also, a court is the only way to get an injunction.  This is my general understanding... not an expert."

I don't want the union involved because they will still try and keep the NFL as clean as possible.  I get my people to contact peterson, rice, rothlesburger and pretty much every other BS punishment Goodell has handed out only to have shot down.  I then name each ower in the suit and ask for damages based on them being complicit in allowing him to continue to claim unjust fines and wages."
Patriots,3ddn1a,mayorjimmy,6,Wed Jul 15 19:20:58 2015 UTC,The NFLPA keep the league as clean as possible? Really? Surely this is a joke.  NFLPA filed a motion for goodell to be held in contempt of court
Patriots,3ddn1a,JustinC00,0,Wed Jul 15 14:40:09 2015 UTC,They still won't go full nuclear when push comes to shove.  They wouldn't sue the owners as individuals which is honestly what needs to start happening.  They put Goddell in place as a buffer and let him continue to ruin the league and until they are held accountable for him they'll be fine letting him take the heat while they keep going to the bank.

Patriots,3debxc,ward0630,18,Wed Jul 15 18:13:21 2015 UTC,You vastly overestimate the speed of the U.S. justice system. Brady might actually be retired by the time his case is fully decided.

It is troubling to me how many people are willing to accept Brady's guilt without ever reading the actual document that implies guilt. The Wells report has been butchered this way and that, and yet the ESPNians continue to spout nonsense with out knowing why Brady actually has a case. It is a sad commentary on our country that one Network has continuously given erroneous reports with out correcting them and our nation believes them without a quest for the actual knowledge. Bob Kravitz and Chris Mortensen created a monster with outright lies that were leaked to them from a source in the NFL. Why has this source not been investigated for propagating an agenda that was so obviously anti Patriots and Anti Brady.

Patriots,3ddfpq,Oedipustrexeliot,31,Wed Jul 15 14:52:55 2015 UTC,Best option for Goodell : Throw Ted Wells under the bus and acknowledge the flawed report. Take away the Brady suspension. We all move on.
Patriots,3ddfpq,bruceholder84,15,Wed Jul 15 14:10:21 2015 UTC,"He needs to knock it down to 0 games and give Brady a fine for not giving up his phone like they did for Favre when he texted dick picks. Everyone wins. Brady gets a fine for not cooperating with the phone and gets his 0 games like it should be. As for the teams first rounder? Unfortunately it has nothing to do with Brady, its a team issue."
Patriots,3ddfpq,NotAModBro,7,Wed Jul 15 15:08:49 2015 UTC,Except for our would-be 1st round selection next year. He doesn't move on.
Patriots,3ddfpq,DCMurphy,3,Wed Jul 15 14:41:34 2015 UTC,We probably would traded away that 32nd overall pick anyways.
Patriots,3ddfpq,bridgecrewdave,5,Wed Jul 15 15:36:20 2015 UTC,"Not that I think there is any chance of getting that pick back, but even if they traded it away, that just means we're short the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th we would have gotten for it."
Patriots,3ddfpq,okthrowaway2088,3,Wed Jul 15 15:41:36 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think so. We've only completely traded out of the first round like 2 or 3 times under BB. Usually trading away a first rounder happened when we had 2 firsts from another trade."

Block ads from nfl.com.  It's super easy, and you should probably be doing this already for unrelated reasons.

The settlement agreement Jones reached with the NFL allowed Texas Stadium Corporation to maintain its contracts with American Express, Pepsi and Nike.  It also provided every other NFL team the opportunity to sign their own stadium sponsorship agreements.  Arguably, though, Jones was the big winner of the settlement agreement, as he also retained the right for the Cowboys to enter into their own licensing agreements.  It is this right that allows the Cowboys to create merchandise apart from the NFL’s licensing agreements."

Patriots,3ddfpq,NotAModBro,6,Wed Jul 15 13:29:02 2015 UTC,The reason rice won is because the cba says you can't increase the suspension.

Patriots,3ddfpq,foxhound1983,8,Wed Jul 15 13:48:37 2015 UTC,"If actual legal standards for are followed (which has to happen in U.S. a court of law), Brady should be fully exonerated. There is no evidence and the NFL's case is full holes.   No matter what Goodell does here today he is going to come out looking like an idiot. If he overturns the suspension people will wonder how the hell the Pats had to pay all those fines but Brady wasn't guilty? If he keeps any part of the suspension, this is going to the courts where standards of evidence are required, which the NFL does not have, and Brady will be fully exonerated. This makes Goodell look even dumber, fining the Pats for no reason at all. I'm sure 90% of NFL fans would be ecstatic if we were fined and docked draft picks for no reason every year, but other owners would be upset (fear it might happen to them) and that's all that matters."

They will argue that the CBA already had punishment guidelines for tampering with the footballs, a $25,000 dollar fine. They will argue the same thing Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy did with the whole retroactive punishment for something that was already decided upon in the CBA. Basically it will come down to this.  The NFL: We believe Tom Brady broke the rules and our suspension is justifiable.  Judge: What was the predetermined punishment in the CBA for the act that Mr Brady allegedly perpetrated last season?  Brady defense: $25,000 dollar fine for ball tampering, as determined by the negotiations in the last CBA per chapter X, line Y.  Judge: Mr Goodell you cannot over punish someone for something that was agreed upon by the NFLPA and the NFL owners. This goes against all workers rights in your league, you cannot abuse the power of punishment for your own means and you must follow the guidelines that you, the owners, and the NFLPA agreed upon."
Patriots,3ddmyv,Donitsu,5,Wed Jul 15 14:28:45 2015 UTC,"The $25,000 fine is only the baseline for the punishment. The punishment can be greater in severity than that."

Patriots,3ddmyv,say_wot_again,6,Wed Jul 15 15:48:40 2015 UTC,"The Patriots were not previously punished for tampering with footballs either. Any rational judge will look at the Carolina/Minnesota game from earlier when they were heating footballs on the sidelines and use that as a base for any punishment the NFL is able to levy against The Patriots.  Also, the NFL has already punished the team for McNally and the rest of the crew that was behind deflate gate, the loss of 2 draft picks and a $1,000,000 fine.   They are now trying to justify a 4 game suspension for a quarterback that by the NFL's own report might not have been even aware of the entirety of the situation, only generally aware that 2 men were getting the balls prepared to be at the lower standard of the legal limit.   The NFL is justified in going after the team for not being more vigilant about McNally but not Brady, Goodell is grasping at straws to try and make a case against Brady so he can save face to 31 other owners, except, EXCEPT! Goodell would have already saved face if he only went after The Patriots and avoided the witch hunt against Brady."

Patriots,3ddmyv,cpxh,11,Wed Jul 15 14:22:30 2015 UTC,Not saying the NFL will be caught for collusion with Ted Wells but if it did happen there would be a 100% chance that team penalties are taken away and Goodell fired. If it is determined that Goodell was hunting this verdict the owners would have no choice but to remove the penalties. If they didn't Robert Kraft could then take legal action with no one able to blame him. Also how do you believe that the owners could get away with keeping Goodell if he colluded against the Patriots? We have already seen that public opinion dictates everything in the NFL so why would this scenario be any different?

Patriots,3ddmyv,cpxh,-1,Wed Jul 15 14:17:59 2015 UTC,"Okay you don't give other fans enough credit. Right now yes public opinion is against the Patriots,  but if Goodell hired someone to find the Patriots guilty with little to no evidence then yes public opinion will turn. Of course you will have those idiots who will say ""good on Goodell for finally taking it to those cheaters"". But there are people out there, believe it or not, that have morals and this would go against that.   Also yes Kraft said he wouldn't sue, but proof of collusion against the Patriots would definitely make him think because the penalties have nothing to stand on. It would never come to that though because if collusion was proven the owners would never uphold those penalties. Again it's a public opinion thing, what would they say to back up their decision to keep the penalties??? Nothing that wouldn't sound ridiculous.  Again though I don't believe this scenario will play out at all. Collusion would be hard to prove and I don't see Brady group going that route to get the suspension lifted."

Patriots,3ddmyv,jmprobus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:25:41 2015 UTC,Brady's not going to accept any suspension.  He's too worried about the image he's built for himself over the years.
Patriots,3ddmyv,ctpatsfan77,-2,Wed Jul 15 16:02:24 2015 UTC,Unfortunately even in federal court odds are the decision sticks. Judges are not likely to overturn an appeal decision due to the CBA. Unless they royally messed up like in the Ray Rice case. Im keeping my fingers crossed.
Patriots,3ddmyv,jmprobus,3,Wed Jul 15 17:51:34 2015 UTC,It is not about the findings - it is about discovery..... the NFL will likely avoid court to keep the potential of this turning into a full blown criminal case of RICO/Racketeering.  Jailtime is a heck of a motivator.
Patriots,3ddmyv,ctpatsfan77,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:06:01 2015 UTC,Don't believe the media blow hards.  The best analog to this is bounty gate where federal courts sided against the NFL despite them trying to hide behind the CBA.
Patriots,3ddmyv,jmprobus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:38:31 2015 UTC,Not true. Pretty much everyone who's gone to court has had the suspension reduced or overturned (see: Bountygate).
Patriots,3ddmyv,ctpatsfan77,0,Wed Jul 15 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"Ray Rice was overturned because of the poor notation during the appeal process. AP was overturned because the rule changed after the crime was committed, so it was void. Bountygate is really the only true comparison. I'm absolutely praying for this to go our way, obviously, just saying its nowhere close to a lock."
Patriots,3ddmyv,jmprobus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:11:23 2015 UTC,"And Goodell botched the discipline here, because the CBA apparently doesn't allow Vincent to assign penalties for conduct detrimental, and, as the NFLPA noted:    “We also note that one arbitrator has previously found that you, in particular, are unfamiliar with proper NFL discipline procedures and have no role in imposing discipline.”"

Patriots,3dey4c,2big_2fail,2,Wed Jul 15 22:05:11 2015 UTC,A must read.  Obviously there will be a quick injunction if Brady's suspension isn't vacated by Goodell.  Patriot fans however need to prepare themselves for an entire season of this matter hanging in the air. An injunction and a procedural delay until the season is concluded seems inevitable.  The NFL has no argument to expedite the case.

He's been in the prisons with me. He's met gang members in my home; he's met gang members in Cleveland [where Belichick coached the Browns from 1991 to '95]. He's put up money. He's opened up areas of education for us very quietly and very strongly. Imagine what would happen if Michael Jordan did the same thing."""

He worked to be recognized as the leader of black America when what black America needs isn't a leader, it is education. Giving speeches and marching, that's not the concept that brings about real freedom, equality and justice. We need a philosophy that is adopted in every household that raising our children to be responsible for their own actions is a must.

The players are pretty small but take some time to walk around the stadium. The view is cool from the bridge/tower. TBH it's more about just being in the stadium - you miss half the game just looking around distracted. I taped the game at home and re-watched it later and realized how many things I missed watching it live in person. Awesome experience though. Have fun!

Your seats are aight, not great (top level; corner endzone), but it's much more about the experience (at least for me it is). You gotta record the game regardless of your seats though, you miss so much being there live.   Tips:   -get there early and spend at least an hour walking the parking lots (dirt lots ftw), it can be more fun than the games out there. Probably my favorite part tbh, the atmosphere is unreal: Tens of thousands of people, and we're all on the same team!! Go pats and can I get a beer!? Fuck yeah! Go pats! Take two! (Seriously,  8 out of 10 tailgaters will straight up give you a beer if you're polite and wearing pats gear.   -give yourself a minimum of 30 minutes to get to your seat before kickoff  -they stop serving beer halfway through the 3rd quarter.  -there's a great game guide on the sidebar of this sub as well."

Patriots,3dg6wp,mattsparrow,3,Thu Jul 16 01:00:02 2015 UTC,I'd take Dez Bryant on my team any day of the week. Guy is a freak of nature and a baller.   I used to be big on Demaryius Thomas but it feels like he's really softened up since Peyton got to Denver. Can't stand watching him bitch for flags any time he's touched.
Patriots,3dg6wp,Sixchr,4,Thu Jul 16 01:50:12 2015 UTC,"WRs call for flags all the time. Hardly just DT. I've never seen him do it myself tbh though.   I think he's a very strong route runner (one of the things he's better than Dez at I think), and very good after the catch. He's def good in the Redzone, gets a lot of yards etc. I think you can't go wrong with either Dez or DT, but I think Dez just shows that extra determination to put him on top. Skill wise, both similar."
Patriots,3dg6wp,TheMagicianDolph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:58:13 2015 UTC,"To be fair, in DT's case it's either soften up and bitch for flags, or play super hard and get Collie'd because Peyton has a tendency to put his receivers in a bad spot."

Patriots,3dg6wp,TheMagicianDolph,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:54:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind having either of them, as having one of them with Gronk and Edelman as targets would just be filthy.

Patriots,3d9kld,pbrunner2012,54,Tue Jul 14 16:49:16 2015 UTC,Its weird I feel like nobody is saying shit about the ridiculousness of taking away our picks because everyone is concentrating on Brady's suspension. I'm still pissed that Kraft didn't even try to appeal it. I know everyone says he didn't have any options but they are wrong he could have at least gone through the motions with an appeal even if Goodell shot him down at the hearing it was still worth the attempt at swaying public opinion or maybe getting the picks reduced
Patriots,3d9kld,broner4brady,33,Tue Jul 14 17:39:15 2015 UTC,"The only way he could appeal the ruling is by going to federal court and it was nowhere near an easy win for Kraft. That's a lot of time and money to expend. Moreover, it would have severely damaged a brand that he is 1/32 owner.   I also strongly suspect that Goodell had/has the support of 51% (or more) of the other owners. Say what you will about the commish, he's not a stupid man. You don't come swinging the big hammer against your biggest supporter unless you have the other owners behind you. I believe that the other owners told Kraft that he either drop it and a accept the penalty or he becomes persona non grata. That's not a sustainable position to be in. I don't like that Kraft capitulated, but I know a Pyrrhic victory when I see one. Kraft made the best long term decision for the club and I wish more fans would recognize that instead of complaining that Kraft didn't fight it more."
Patriots,3d9kld,RegressToTheMean,7,Tue Jul 14 17:47:05 2015 UTC,I'm thankful
Patriots,3d9kld,kamdaman1212,6,Tue Jul 14 20:02:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly - it doesn't make me happy, because part of me wants to see Roger Goodell shot from the sky like the Red Baron he is.  That said, Kraft was in no position legally to pull the trigger, for exactly the reasons you've offered here.  We will be OK, though losing picks hurts."
Patriots,3d9kld,PleaseHaveSome,8,Tue Jul 14 22:33:32 2015 UTC,"At least one was a first round pick. We don't really need those anyway. Now, if they took a sixth round pick..."

Patriots,3d9kld,jotch,4,Tue Jul 14 23:52:37 2015 UTC,I know everyone says he didn't have any options but they are wrong he could have at least gone through the motions with an appeal    He really couldn't. There's no appeal process for that. His only option would be to sue the NFL and his 31 partners.
Patriots,3d9kld,hampsted,2,Tue Jul 14 23:04:04 2015 UTC,ya his appeal would not go through Goodell at all. Only through courts which would be hard to win near impossible really
Patriots,3d9kld,bmajeremy,2,Tue Jul 14 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"I know dude, and that's Goodell's whole plan. Rules in the CBA made it impossible for us to practically fight the draft pick and fine decisions. He tacked the Brady thing on as a big distraction. Then he can take it, mostly, away and make it look like he's being lenient. He's a criminal. This has all been a cheap way of screwing us and leveling off the field of competition for all the other teams in the league."
Patriots,3d9kld,pbrunner2012,121,Tue Jul 14 21:21:59 2015 UTC,the fact that balls probably weren't deflated seems to get lost in the shuffle. If the media bothered to cover the aei study and such we'd have a better chance since public opinion is all the league seems to care about.
Patriots,3d9kld,ufcfan4893,22,Tue Jul 14 16:10:05 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent point. The initial attack by the media was to be expected; they run with the biggest story, after all.  But why no story to run with when the Patriots had studies exonerating them? Could it be because nobody wants to fucking hear that angle and it wouldn't have the same response?   The media did us two disservices with deflategate. Fuck their dishonesty and lack of integrity."
Patriots,3d9kld,dtdroid,13,Tue Jul 14 19:16:47 2015 UTC,"But...isn't this what we wanted? If he's getting four games, it makes it look a lot better for Brady right?"
Patriots,3d9kld,livinlifeontheedge,18,Tue Jul 14 16:28:02 2015 UTC,"No. Greg Hardy got a legitimate arbitrator in Harold Henderson. Henderson would probably wipe Brady's entire suspension. Unfortunately, Goodell is the one overseeing Brady's appeal."
Patriots,3d9kld,hampsted,3,Tue Jul 14 23:05:33 2015 UTC,"True, I completely forgot about that. Nevertheless, it could still help Brady's case"
Patriots,3d9kld,livinlifeontheedge,24,Tue Jul 14 23:21:27 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the NFL will come back with 1 game suspension and fine for Brady and Brady won't back down.  He shouldn't back down.
Patriots,3d9kld,gokism,16,Tue Jul 14 16:45:10 2015 UTC,Didn't Tom's lawyer say that they won't even take a one game suspension and that Tom doesn't want to be in any part of this?

Patriots,3d9kld,zamboniman46,13,Tue Jul 14 19:51:13 2015 UTC,The lawyer actually said that even a one-game suspension means he goes to federal court. I don't think it's so much a bargaining game as a threat.
Patriots,3d9kld,taxiSC,5,Tue Jul 14 23:51:37 2015 UTC,"Anything to make Goodell still look tough to the owners backing his witch hunt.    I think it goes to court and the discovery requirements (Owner,  Goodell and other NFL cell phones, text messages, E-mails) put up by Brady and the NFLPA scare the crap out of all the folks forcing the suspension for a competitive advantage."

It isn't about what they did or didn't do it is about how they are perceived. In this case before the ruling on Brady's appeal it looks like the NFL is saying that more probably than not knowing about potential ball deflation is equally as damaging to the NFL's image as beating your wife and then paying her off to get out of criminal charges."

Unfortunately I would have to argue that the notion of a player tampering with equipment IS more damaging than a player being convicted or suspected of violent crimes off the field. At this point I'm not arguing about Brady's guilt or innocence, I'm only trying to discuss how the issues are perceived by the public.   There have been a few posts on /r/nfl asking what it would take for fans to finally stop watching the NFL. One of the most consistent answers is that fixing games, a form of cheating on the football field, would finally turn them away from the NFL. While refs fixing games is not equivalent to a slightly deflated football I would still consider this to be evidence that having an equal playing field and holding up the integrity of the game is the most essential aspect of retaining NFL viewership.  In regards to criminal behavior we have already seen a plethora of criminal activity in the NFL and it has had seemingly no negative impact on the growth or retention of the NFL fanbase. The OJ murders, the Sharper rape case, the Hernandez murder trial, the killings surrounding Marvin Harrison, Darrel Russel's brutal rape case...the list goes on and on. Yet these do no affect fans. These are perceived as issues with the individuals who committed the crimes, not an issue with the league as a whole.   While it's an admittedly short argument, the reasons I previously mentioned are why I would argue that the issue involving Brady really is more impactful to the NFL as a whole compared to the incident involving Hardy."
Patriots,3d9kld,ABearWithABeer,7,Tue Jul 14 17:17:22 2015 UTC,"Salary cap violations, Pumping noise into stadiums, warming footballs on the sidelines,  coaches tripping players, Stickum, Offensive lines using vaseline on their arms and jerseys, Recording opponent's practices...  I'd go on but I think you get the point.  As with criminal activity by players off the field you also get plenty of rules violations(a.k.a cheating) on the field.  Sure fixing a game may be the straw that breaks the camel's back for some fans on /r/nfl (not sure I'd be using that as your baseline) but apparently the ""cheating"" thing isn't all that big of a deal in how they perceive the league."

Patriots,3d9kld,Haze_n_Freedom,3,Tue Jul 14 18:28:49 2015 UTC,Try looking at it from an integrity of the league point of view.  Hardy's infraction may have been off the field but he is a representative of the league.  If the main focus of the NFL front office is to protect the shield and the integrity of the game then they must address issues like Hardy.  From this point of view it is laughable that the Hardy incident warrants the same punishment as Brady and a possible PSI violation.
Patriots,3d9kld,TNT_Banana,-5,Tue Jul 14 19:32:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think people view Hardy as an issue with the league. We've had murderers, rapists, thieves and drunk drivers in the NFL before and it has had no discernable impact on how people view the league as a whole. I think that most people view criminal behavior as something that the individual should be held accountable rather than that individuals behavior.   While I would certainly prefer the league crack down on criminal behavior and try to hold their players to a higher ethical standard the fact of the matter is they don't. Even the Patriots have signed players who have been convicted of killing another person and faced no backlash.   If you look at what the incidents relate to you have Hardy's case which is a criminal matter involving an off the field incident that has zero impact on any games played and then you have Brady's issue which involves the NFL rulebook and if true would directly impact a game (Even though I don't personally think 1 PSI makes a difference). You can understand how Brady's issue could be perceived as more relevant to the NFL based on that right?"
Patriots,3d9kld,ABearWithABeer,3,Tue Jul 14 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"The NFL's argument for both situations is conduct detrimental.  At this point it doesn't matter if it's on-field or off-field.     I don't think people view Hardy as an issue with the league. We've had murderers, rapists, thieves and drunk drivers in the NFL before and it has had no discernable impact on how people view the league as a whole.   This may be true to people who have a modicum of common sense but in today's environment DV is a huge issue in the eyes of the public.  Hardy, Rice, Peterson, etc. are all representatives of the NFL.  The NFL looks bad when players act out."
Patriots,3d9kld,TNT_Banana,4,Tue Jul 14 22:13:32 2015 UTC,"and yet they carry the same penalty.  They both fall under ""conduct detrimental..."" so saying that aren't the same isn't 100% correct.

Patriots,3ddpun,fatheadbob,2,Wed Jul 15 14:20:39 2015 UTC,"aaaand they're gone...  I've always had luck on the ticket exchange, give that a shot if you are a waitlist member"
Patriots,3ddpun,okthrowaway2088,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:05:09 2015 UTC,I'm not a waitlist member but saw the exchange. Are you on it? Are you able to even see if there are 3 tix for the Jets game on Oct 25th (any section)?
Patriots,3ddpun,FlyingDoctor,2,Wed Jul 15 14:06:20 2015 UTC,"You gotta wait a little bit before tix start showing up there, few weeks maybe a month.  I was actually looking for 3 tix to the Jets game too, good luck!"
Patriots,3ddpun,fatheadbob,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:10:43 2015 UTC,Thanks. I was just reading the FAQ on the Pats site to get on the list. I might do the deposit - just not sure if it will save me much over StubHub prices.
Patriots,3ddpun,FlyingDoctor,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:14:02 2015 UTC,"How many games are you planning on going to? That $100 is only once, and you can save that much per ticket on some games."

Patriots,3ddpun,par016,3,Wed Jul 15 14:21:01 2015 UTC,you also get the money back when you go off the list if I recall.
Patriots,3ddpun,fatheadbob,2,Wed Jul 15 14:23:14 2015 UTC,Its $200 and I do remember seeing that you could get it back whenever you want. Although I'm not sure about the fine print stuff if you try and do that just to get access to the tix exchange every year. There might be some language in there preventing that.
Patriots,3ddpun,okthrowaway2088,3,Wed Jul 15 14:36:11 2015 UTC,Its $100 per ticket with a 2 ticket minimum though.
Patriots,3ddpun,NouEngland,2,Wed Jul 15 14:38:10 2015 UTC,The math checks out ;) I thought it was a flat rate. I signed up like 4 years ago and forget the process.
Patriots,3ddpun,NouEngland,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:55:07 2015 UTC,Can you trade tickets on the exchange?  Even if you aren't on the waitlist?  I got tix to the Titans but I really wanted to go to the Eagles game.

Patriots,3ddpun,RogueInteger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:18:53 2015 UTC,Is it worth it to join the waitlist? I would never actually buy season tix (I live in Canada) but I'm guessing tons of folks join the waitlist and just cancel and get their money back?
Patriots,3ddpun,InflatableStego,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:22:07 2015 UTC,Yep. Totally worth it IMO if you plan on attending games. $100 per seat gives you access to presales (both regular and post-season). And often there are seats that get released to the exchange during the season too.
Patriots,3ddpun,okthrowaway2088,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:56:29 2015 UTC,Geez. You got 4 from the presale? I couldn't get any for the Jets on there.

It's better than getting locked into a situation they don't want to get locked into.  That said, I hope they do sign him for a few more years, he's a fantastic kicker. And kickers typically don't fall off with age the same way other positions do."

Patriots,3dfcve,venture70,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:30:55 2015 UTC,"I'm an amateur editor (with an emphasis on amateur).  But, since you took the time to both write it and reach out, I'll give you some feedback.  You got most of the important facts, save a couple, but it's also written in a passive voice that's generally saved for boring scientific literature, not arguably the greatest Superbowl in history.  :)  So, how you write it depends on your target audience, which you didn't specify.  But --  I'll leave you the definitive 4th quarter write-up/running diary for comparison.  Scroll down to the part that reads:  ""This left the Patriots with 12 minutes to score twice while knowing …""  In general, the write up would be better if you did a few things:    Put statistics/events in proper context (both historical and time/score-wise)  Keep viewers engaged by reminding them of the current situation  Better formatting (more line breaks)   A few of examples:  In your Build Up section, you should note that the Patriots came from ""not one, but TWO"" 14-point deficits (an NFL record) to ultimately defeat the Ravens.  Likewise, the Seahawks came from behind in the NFC Championship game, trailing the Green Bay Packers 19-7 with two minutes left, completing both a Hail-Mary two-point conversion and a miraculous onsides kick.  How I'd start the Fourth Quarter section:  Fourth Quarter  24-14 (Give the score here to set the context)  No team had ever overcome a double-digit second-half deficit to win a Super Bowl before, and teams trailing by 10 or more points at the start of the fourth quarter had been 0-29 in past Super Bowls.  And, not only did the Seahawks have the best defense in the league, but they hadn't lost a game they led in the fourth quarter by 10 points or more since 2004.  I would then describe the two Patriots scoring drives and the Seahawks final drive.    Note that the first Patriot drive required converting a 3rd-and-14 play with the entire season on the line, where Brady ultimately completed a 21-yard pass to Julian Edelman.  ...  Final drive  ...  In a fourth quarter for the ages, Brady went 13-15 for 124 yards and 2 touchdowns (against the best defense in the league) winning his 3rd Superbowl MVP and record-tying 4th Superbowl title."

Patriots,3d9elf,Hockeygirl1974,5,Tue Jul 14 18:06:49 2015 UTC,"I can't see switching between division rivals and then becoming a superfan, but personally I'm a big NFL fan in general and support both the Vikings and Patriots for different reasons.    I grew up in MN watching the Vikings every week but was pretty turned off to the NFL after Gary Fucking Anderson missed his first and only field goal of the entire year in 1998 to keep the Vikings out of their first Superbowl appearance of my lifetime.  A lot of my friends were convinced the game was rigged and I even had some doubts.  Then in 1999 I moved here and a year after that, Brady happened, and how do you not get excited about the GOAT coach and QB if they're playing in your adopted home town?    I'll happily watch any good football game especially if I have some rooting interest, but if the Vikings and Patriots are on at the same time I'm watching the Patriots.  When they play each other every four years I root Patriots because their record matters more most years.    If the Pats sucked all these years or GFA hadn't missed that kick, I might still be strictly a Vikings fan, but any good football fan has to respect and admire how the current Pats go about their business of contending every single year."

I like other teams (one of which was in the superbowl last year, don't hate me) but being from New England the Pats will always be my #1, and I remember when they were terrible."
Patriots,3d9elf,EMateos,3,Tue Jul 14 19:06:55 2015 UTC,Even still where you're from shouldn't be the deciding factor necessarily. If I'm from Buffalo and really enjoy San Francisco why not root for San Francisco? If I'm from New York and I really like the colors that the Buccaneers use why can't I be a Buccaneer fan?  To me you can go ahead and pick any reason whatsoever to root for any team that you want.   I don't think any differently about a fan roots for the Cowboys because they think Tony Romo is sexy vs a fan who roots for the jets because they have a staunch die hard fandom for everything that comes out of New York City. I guess what I'm trying to say is why anyone roots for any team and for what duration doesn't really matter to me like it does to a lot of people.
Patriots,3d9elf,Lordhuckington,0,Tue Jul 14 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"I for one hate the Yankees, Knicks, and the Jets due to their free agency splurges. Due to various reasons (madden, when football was introduced to me I loved the passing component and didn't care for the running aspect, and enjoying to watching a team rebuild.) I've wound up a Patriots fan and a Browns fan.  P.S. Since I started watching football around ~2006 I've come to dislike the Giants as well as whoever has been drafting for the Browns."

Patriots,3d9elf,Lordhuckington,0,Tue Jul 14 17:55:04 2015 UTC,"Maybe there's not a team in their home town, or maybe they don't like the place they were born in. I think you should pick whatever team you like, and not the one your parenst like, or your home team."
Patriots,3d9elf,GenrlWashington,0,Tue Jul 14 21:20:35 2015 UTC,Growing up in Los Angeles I had no team. My team was chosen in the first QB football team I got as a trading card. Also helped that my middle school coach was from Boston.

Patriots,3d9elf,kingletas,2,Wed Jul 15 00:47:43 2015 UTC,"San Diego   Never!   I grew up an LA sports fan (LA Galaxy, Dodgers, Lakers, and I don't really follow hockey) the only exception is Football, growing up as a kid Pat fan I was picked on by 9er kids, raider, Chargers,  a hint of Cowboys and whatever was left of the Ram fans. I have a very strong contempt for Cali based Football teams for sporting a different jersey.  Wore my Bledsoe jersey with pride!  So NO! Circumstances had me raised as a Patriot Fan in Los Angeles."
Patriots,3d9elf,Lordhuckington,0,Wed Jul 15 00:55:07 2015 UTC,Agreed.  Just because there are very few saints fans around me doesn't mean I'm going to become a steelers or Broncos fan just to fit in with the larger groups around me. I only real root for patriots because my wife was already a huge fan. But if we ever met in a superbowl I'd be rooting for the saints all game.
Patriots,3d9elf,NotARealGynecologist,3,Tue Jul 14 17:30:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is totally different. Big difference between rooting for two different teams, and being a Dolphins fan that switches and becomes a supposed die hard Jets fan."

Patriots,3d9aj1,beannet,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:25:43 2015 UTC,"My god, I have never seen such an epic failure by an entire offensive line at the same time. All six blockers made basically unforgivable mistakes. The left tackle fails to create a pocket, giving the defensive end a straight line path to the QB. The left guard ignores the blitzing linebacker, exposing his back to him so that he falls over when the linebacker just brushes by him. The center manages to get hands on his assignment, but instead of blocking is path, he pushes him in the same direction he is going, and ends up helping to knock over the right guard. The right guard completely whiffs on his assignment, and after being essentially tackled by the center, proceeds to arm tackle the right tackle. The right tackle did about the closest to a positive on the play, in that after letting Ninkovich get around him, he nearly got a hold/horse collar on him, which would have been a penalty, but still better than getting his QB killed. The RB meanwhile over pursues on the blitzing Collins, allowing him get a line around him, and allowing the bigger threat in Jones to run in untouched. The only person to successfully block anyone is the center Mangold, but only after letting 1 guy by and knocking over 2 of his own teammates."
Patriots,3d9aj1,bryanpcox,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:29:08 2015 UTC,"That blitz package tore up that line like teeth in food. I think Jaime Collins gets the lil gold star for this one.  Collins blows past his block initially and nails the LG right as he thought he'd hit Chandler Jones.  Instead of making like a banshee to the QB, which Collins very well could have done, he instead goes for the collapse of the line.  Went for the team-move, not star-move."

Considering BB has coached Brady, Bruschi, Law, Revis, Harrison, Seymour, Wilfork, TB80 (all pretty damn smart player), it's obvious how much respect the hoodie has for the man."

Patriots,3df3kx,FunkyMonkeyBanana,3,Wed Jul 15 19:47:55 2015 UTC,It doesn't matter at this point if everything was a marketing ploy or whatnot. Nobody in the NFL gives a shit about the Pats and so we are stuck with the punishments. Kraft has no power at all and was forcibly bent over by Goodell in front of the whole league and nobody bat an eye. I don't see a lifted suspension as a likely outcome from Goodells arbitration and so Brady will have to take it to court. Also Brady has never been cast as the good guy. Peyton Manning is the golden boy and Brady is his antithesis. There is no incentive for Goodell to undo what he has done. He doesn't care if it is fair or if it is warranted all he cares about is his brand.
Patriots,3df3kx,broner4brady,-5,Wed Jul 15 20:05:59 2015 UTC,"This is a butthurt response, dude. The Patriots have had a lot of good fortune via the NFL, I can't support your stance.  Goodell doesn't have it out for the Patriots or Kraft.  Kraft made his statement in the fashion he did to set an example for other owners in the league and to keep investigators out of the Patriots organization causing disruption and distractions.  It had little to nothing to do with Kraft being bent over lol"
Patriots,3df3kx,broner4brady,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:18:23 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that Kraft believes the punishments are too harsh and not warranted by the situation due to his press conferences. I'm also pretty sure that Kraft believes that there is not enough proof of wrong doing to warrant any penalty due to the rebuttal website. I'm also pretty sure Kraft accepted the penalties reluctantly due to his press conferences. So Kraft accepted the harshest penalty in the history of the NFL, that he believes is too harsh, for cheating he doesn't believe even happened. That is called being bent over. Kraft was left with very little options and opted not to go nuclear which I can't necessarily blame him for, he is a business man before he is a fan.  I also never said Goodell has it out for the Patriots he just doesn't give a shit about them. He doesn't give a shit about any team. All he cares about is his brand, the NFL. He took the situation and ran with it to benefit his brand the most. He doesn't give a fuck about being fair or just or honest. All he cares about is profitability. The NFL has been dominating the news during the off season like they never have before so what he has done is a success. It is an easy talking point for folks who aren't die hard fans. Brand discovery and recognition has likely increased significantly this off season. Now if all this exposure has been good for the NFL then what benefit is it to Goodell to remove the suspension. Why would he admit he is wrong when he doesn't have to? Why would he be fair when he doesn't have to? At the same time if he removes the suspension it places a spotlight on the incompetency of the NFL that they spent 5 mil on a bullshit investigation that they threw out."
Patriots,3df3kx,JeefyPants,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:00:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you say. I don't think we see eye to eye on the cause for Kraft's statement and acceptance. He has a whole team of council as well as Belicheck to talk with.  He's just the face and ultimately the final say on those matters.  The NFL has already fucked up. They know it. Kraft is sort of embarrassing them now for even accepting the initial punishment as I think this suspension will be redacted. It isn't always a bad thing to change your mind on a matter. By admitting fault and publicizing it properly Goodell can wipe some of the egg off his face. If he doesn't and Tom goes to the Feds?! Oh, boy. Goodell is gonna be in for it. Don't think it's just a leak that everyone has heard of the Federal appeal threat. That's as political and negotiating a move made by Brady and more so the NFLPA as any of the other stuff we've watched."
Patriots,3df3kx,JeefyPants,2,Wed Jul 15 21:16:06 2015 UTC,This makes literally zero sense considering there have already been penalties applied to NE.
Patriots,3df3kx,kingletas,-2,Wed Jul 15 19:55:01 2015 UTC,"That has more to do with Kraft not wanting to open up the books than it does the reality of the situation.  Kraft could've won, but it would've cost him too much internal exposure."

Patriots,3d9ach,nihoyminioy,2,Tue Jul 14 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"Obviously, the most important thing is that he held onto the ball, right, Sage Rosenfels?"
Patriots,3d9ach,ctpatsfan77,2,Tue Jul 14 20:05:34 2015 UTC,"I really liked the Pats' usage of the Jet Sweep last year. Started week one and they used that wrinkle as a decoy until the super bowl. Watch the first drive, first series of XLIX and they run it as a decoy. Hope this trend continues and they consider giving it to Amendola as well as Edelman. Really like this play-call, it's under utilized at NFL level."
Patriots,3d9ach,MalcolmButlersTruck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:03:29 2015 UTC,I think they got first downs 100% of the time they ran it this season. Almost exclusively in short yardage
Patriots,3d9ach,grovebost1,4,Wed Jul 15 02:00:26 2015 UTC,"LaFell was weak on the blocking, usually a strength of his."
Patriots,3d9ach,fixyouregrammar,5,Tue Jul 14 15:44:50 2015 UTC,"I think he chipped the inside DB to the outside expecting Jules to cut inside. He was trying to play his outside coverage man and that extra inside DB at the same time, which he's done effectively before.  I agree - poor results, but a good idea IMO."
Patriots,3d9ach,MagnumBear,2,Tue Jul 14 16:44:29 2015 UTC,That looks like exactly what he was doing. Looks like he was trying to head up field right afterwards to get another block.
Patriots,3d9ach,LAborn_TXraised,0,Tue Jul 14 17:20:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, but if he held his block on 24, better result."
Patriots,3d9ach,fixyouregrammar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:58:02 2015 UTC,"Look at the second angle again: 20 hits his leg before 25 even touches him, he might have avoided another hit but he's probably not gaining any extra yardage. He's already going end over end after 20 hits him low."
Patriots,3d9ach,textbooksforrent,2,Tue Jul 14 18:16:39 2015 UTC,"I thought so on the first watch, but I actually think he did alright. Considering it was a short yardage situation, hitting the inside DB coming across took his momentum away and the outside DB wasn't in a position to fully stop Edelman before he crossed the marker. First down, Patriots."
Patriots,3d9ach,stay_puft_man,2,Tue Jul 14 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"i disagree, lafell was correct to block there and in that direction, edelman should have driven up the middle rather than to the outside."

He plays it perfectly, he makes the outside guy hesitate and makes sure the inside guy doesn't have a direct path.  There was a 0% chance of Edelman not getting the first down."
Patriots,3d9ach,textbooksforrent,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:13:10 2015 UTC,"I think he was pretty much just playing to get the first down, unfortunately it caused Jules to get smashed lol."

The face/head layer as a clipping mask and then a Screen transparency on the top layer which is on top of a photo within the clipping mask. You basically described what I did haha.

Patriots,3dacee,muff_bandit,46,Tue Jul 14 19:02:01 2015 UTC,What 2 minute drive?  They lose every Pats game by 40 points.  :D
Patriots,3dacee,venture70,22,Tue Jul 14 19:57:08 2015 UTC,"Since he has entered the league, Andrew Luck has played 3 games at New England. He has lost all three games by scores of 24-59 (2012), 22-43 (2013 playoffs), and 7-45 (2014 playoffs).  Perhaps the Patriots feel he is so dangerous that they want to mess with his two minute offense when the Colts are losing by multiple possessions.   Of course, we don't have to worry about any other quarterback which is why we haven't messed with them and why we haven't seen others on record as making the same complaint."
Patriots,3dacee,spacecowboy007,-4,Tue Jul 14 20:39:07 2015 UTC,"Most likely scenario: Luck made a joke. Specifically naming the Pats may have been done in poor taste. It might, however, make the joke work a little better than just saying, ""it tends to go out during 2-minute drills on the road."" It was a shitty joke, but I doubt it was malicious like everyone wants to think."

Patriots,3dacee,Dr-DuB,78,Tue Jul 14 20:28:43 2015 UTC,"Remember before the Super Bowl, when BB was discussing how they prepare to run their two minute drills without communication equipment because it always goes down in the final minutes because of all the cell phone use?  Remember how he told that story of him dealing with that situation like a man and didn't blame anyone else for his fucking problems?  Cause that seems like a better option then this whiney ass innuendo shit."

From what he's saying it seems like their communications gear was already wonky at that point, because he points out how Matt P was doing a good job of getting players on and off the field.  He brings up 07 as another time when it happened.  This neatly explains why he was less inclined to use the timeout, as getting the offense to run a 2-minute or 1/2-minute drill without comm gear would have been prohibitively difficult.  That might also explain why Seattle let so much time run down between plays; their comm gear may have been down and they may have had confusion there too."

Since he has entered the league, he has played 3 games at New England. He has lost all three games by scores of 24-59 (2012), 22-43 (2013 playoffs), and 7-45 (2014 playoffs).  None of these games were close, and it must be the last two minutes of the first half he is talking about since I doubt they are in a two offense when you are getting blown out in the 4th quarter with two minutes to play.

Patriots,3d5dac,okthrowaway2088,12,Mon Jul 13 17:32:50 2015 UTC,"Getting tickets:    Directly from the team: Individual game tickets go on sale to general public sometime in mid-July. The specific date for that year will be announced a month or two in advance (in 2015 this is July 15th). These tickets are sold via Ticketmaster. In order to buy them, you will need to use a Visa debit or credit card. While this has the advantages of being at face value and being assured to be legitimate, it has the downside of being very hard to accomplish. Due to the team's great run of success, these individual game tickets sell out extremely quickly. Particularly popular games (such as when Peyton comes to town) can sell out during the presale to wait-list members. That is, some of the games are completely sold out prior to going on sale to the general public. Even if the tickets aren't sold out when the sale begins, there are so many people trying to purchase at once that you need to get lucky and refresh at the exact right time to grab the seats you want. This method is great when it works, but is unreliable.  From the secondary market: Buying your tickets from someone who already has them is the way most non-Season Ticket Holders will get their tickets. The major downside is that this is expensive, especially for the more popular games. Another risk is that it's harder to confirm the tickets are real. Using a site like StubHub protects you against fake tickets (StubHub will refund you if you have a problem), but has more fees. You can often save money by trying Craigslist, but you have no way to make sure you are getting real tickets and no recourse if you get turned away at the gate. SeatGeek is a website that does the same thing as Kayak, but for tickets. This can help you find the best listing. If you are buying on the secondary market, and don't need to be sure of your trip ahead of time, you can often get a better deal by waiting until shortly before the game. Sellers get desperate as the game approaches, because the tickets are worthless after the game so they will usually drop their price when it gets close.  From the wait list:  If you plan on attending multiple games (or eventually want season tickets), it might be worth it to check into the Wait List. Right now, you can't get Patriots Season Tickets, and there are somewhere around 60,000 people in line waiting for them. The estimate is that it will take decades to get them (the people who are getting season tickets right now signed up in the early 2000s, before the huge spike that followed sustained success). So, why bother signing up if you won't get season tickets for 20 years? Because, if you are on the wait list for season tickets, you can get individual games now.  Before we cover the benefits, we'll go over the cost. It costs $100 per seat to get on the wait list, up to a maximum of 4 seats. This is a deposit, so when you eventually get tickets it will be applied to the cost of your first season, and it is refundable, so you can get the money back if you decide to leave the list before you get tickets. However, you do still tie up a couple of hundred dollars for years.  The most obvious benefit of being on the wait list is that you will eventually get season tickets. However, there are several benefits that you can use in the meantime. Considering how they are immediately available, these benefits are arguably better than saving your spot for season tickets. The main type of benefit is access to individual game tickets. There are a couple of ways that Wait List members can get tickets: Ticketexchange and pre-sales.   The Patriots TicketExchange is the only way that Season Ticket Holders (STHs) are officially allowed to resell their tickets, and is only available to buyers who are STHs or Wait List members. They must do so at face value (and the buyer has to pay an additional ~$10 fee per order). Their incentive to sell their tickets at this price, rather than marked up through a secondary market, is to preserve their own season tickets. If they are caught reselling season tickets, the Patriots will revoke their season tickets. Given the decades it takes to get season tickets right now, that's a pretty big deal. On top of being caught in the actual act of reselling, STHs are responsible for whoever is sitting in their seats. If they sell tickets to someone, and that person starts a fight (or other disruptive behavior), the season ticket holder is deemed responsible for them being there (which may result in loss of season tickets). When a STH sells through the Ticket Exchange, it is endorsed by the Patriots, and the responsibility for behavior is transferred to the buyer. This means the STH can recoup their face value without risking their place as a STH.  From the perspective of a Wait List member, the Ticket Exchange offers a way to purchase individual game tickets at face value (there is also the per ticket fee, but the face value price is the STH face value price, which is slightly lower than individual game price). The buyer is also assured that the tickets are legitimate. For most games, tickets mostly become available about a week before the game. Some less popular games (e.g. a late season game against the Bills), will have listings available right at the start of the season. For very popular games (such as a Jets-Patriots game), tickets may be sparse until 1-2 days before the game.  The second way that Wait List members can get tickets is through pre-sales. The Patriots do a pre-sale for both the regular season and playoffs. About a week before the regular season individual game tickets go on sale, Wait List members get access to a private sale. This lets them buy tickets before the huge rush of the general public. Some popular games may still be sold out, due to STHs buying extra seats or faster Wait List members buying up the rest during the pre-sale, but this is an easier way to get face value tickets than during the general sale. In recent years, these pre-sale packages have required the purchase of a preseason game to go along with each regular season game. Due to the new variable pricing, this isn't as big of a burden as it has been previously.  Wait List members also get access to a pre-sale for home playoff games. Due to the higher demand, it is still difficult to get playoff tickets through the pre-sale, but it is impossible to get them via the general sale since they will sell out during the pre-sale. The number of playoff tickets a Wait List member can purchase is limited to a max of 4 (and the 2011 AFCCG was limited to 2), to try and spread out the small supply.   Choosing your seat location:    The best seat location involves a lot of personal preference. There are a lot of trade offs between price, distance from the field, viewing angle, exposure to elements, and ease of entry/exit.  Here's the seat map (including some pricing information).  Ticket prices vary based on location in the stadium (obviously), and starting in the 2014 season, by opponent. For this season (2015), the base price games are the Titans, Bills, Redskins, Dolphins, and Jaguars. The ""Marquee"" games of the Jets and Eagles are about 35% more than those, and the ""NFL Kickoff"" game of the Steelers is 70% above the base price. The following chart lists some of the benefits of each location. Keep in mind that the east side of the stadium (Patriots sideline) will have more sun than the west side (visitor sideline).    Seat Location Price Distance Viewing Angle Elements Access    Upper corner Lowest Far Fair, overhead Exposed to overhead and wind Longest walk to exits   Upper sideline Low Far Good,overhead Exposed to overhead and wind Longest walk to exits   Upper midfield Medium-Low Far Great,overhead Exposed to overhead and wind Longest walk to exits   Mezzanine Corner Medium Medium Good, overhead Most seats exposed to overhead, partially protected from wind Easy walk to exits   Club section Highest ++ Medium Great, overhead Partially exposed, access to protected concourse with windows Private access from private lots   Lower corner/endzone Medium-High Close Poor (great for 1/3 of field) Exposed to overhead Easy walk to exits   Lower sideline High Close Good Exposed to overhead Easy walk to exits   Lower midfield Higher Close Great Exposed to overhead Medium walk to exits    Handicap Accessible Seating: The stadium does sell handicap accessible tickets but they sell out quickly (like all tickets). What many people don't know is that you can buy regular tickets and exchange them for handicap accessible seating at the ticket office on the day of the game. These seats are located between the 200/300 levels. The ticket office will try and accommodate everyone in the party but they only guarantee a spot for the person who is handicapped and one guest. If for some reason someone in the party can not get a seat the way that the seating is set up makes standing room in the area available and convenient."
Patriots,3d5dac,TurkandJD,6,Mon Jul 13 17:33:10 2015 UTC,"Getting there (and back):    Traffic is not as bad as people make it out to be, unless you show up just before the game, try to park in the stadium lots, and then try to leave immediately.  Driving:  If you show up early to tailgate (which you absolutely should), traffic won't be an issue before the game. If you arrive close to kickoff, traffic can add 20-30 minutes to the end of your trip (i.e. on Route 1). Note that on game days the breakdown lane on Route 1 is open for driving. A lot of people don't take advantage of this, so you can often skip a lot of traffic by staying to the far right lane. However, don't try to use backroads to bypass the traffic: police block off access to the side roads on game day to all non-residents, so the only approach to Gillette is on Route 1. At the end of the game you have 2 good options to avoid sitting around for a long time getting out of the parking lot: tailgate again for an hour or two, or leave from one of the private lots. To do the second, park in one of the private business lots about a mile before the stadium. When you leave you'll get in the lane that's been reversed in direction, and you'll be in front of all the merging that goes on to leave the parking lot, saving you more than enough time to make up for the walk. You will have to use Route 1 to get to the stadium regardless of whether you are coming the from the north or south.  There are a lot of options for parking. The stadium lots are the closest to the game, and cost $40 per car. They also take the longest to leave due to traffic. There are about 17500 stadium spots, with about half located across Route 1 from the stadium. These lots open 4 hours before the game. You do not need your ticket to park in the stadium lots (or any of the private lots, obviously).  In addition to the stadiums lots, all the businesses along Route 1 near the stadium offer parking on game days. The price at these lots varies depending on proximity to the stadium, but is in the range of $25-50 (yes, the last private lots just before the stadium lots cost more than the stadium lots). The main advantage of these lots is that it can let you avoid traffic, but being out in front of most of the merging. They also can be cheaper, depending how far you walk. Finally, you get access to the services of the business while parked (for instance you can eat McDonald's or Chinese food or go the liquor store while tailgating). The downside is that you have to walk further to get to and from the game (plus they are smaller so tailgates aren't as much part of a massive party).  Bus: Similar to driving, you can take a bus to the game. Rally Bus is a company that books travel buses for groups. On their site you can search by team for whichever game you are interested in attending & purchase spots on the bus by the seat. Each team/city has designated pick-up locations (Rally Points). The bus eliminates the hassle of driving, parking and navigating for those who aren't from the area or those who want to drink. You can eat and drink on the buses while heading to the game. The buses park in one of the Gillette lots & arrives about 3 hours prior to the kickoff allowing plenty of time to tailgate (you may bring some tailgating items on the bus), then departs the game 45 minutes after the end of the game taking you back to the ""Rally Point"" the bus departed from before the game. Prices vary (depending on game and number of people on the bus) but seem to be in the $30-$50 range per person. At least 25 people must book a specific bus for it to be confirmed. You will still need to get to and from the Rally Point.  Train: There is a train that runs to Patriots games, from both Boston and Providence. While it does not offer a lot of options, it might be better depending on your specific situation. The train will cost $15 dollars per person. If you are going alone or with 1 other person, this can be cheaper than parking costs. The train will take at least an hour and 5 minutes to get from South Station (or Providence) to Gillette (the section of the track that is the Gillette spur requires the train to go very slowly). You won't get there early enough to tailgate or anything; you'll have to go straight in once you get there. The train is scheduled to get there about an hour before kickoff, but it can get behind schedule. It will take the same amount of time to travel back after the game, but the train won't leave for a while, as it needs to let people board (officially this is 30 minutes after the conclusion of the game). Expect it to take up to 1 hour and 45 minutes after the game ends to get back to the city. You'll want to head straight back to the train when the game ends. If you are going alone or with just one other person, don't want to tailgate, and are going to be right along one of the two routes (see the previously linked website for specific stops), the train might be a better option for you. Buy your tickets in advance to make sure you get one of the ~1500 spots.  Where to stay:  If you are coming from out of town, you may want to spend the night to avoid all the travel in one day (or turn it into a whole weekend trip). There are two main questions you will need to answer to decide where to stay: What do you want to do besides the game? How much are you willing to spend?  If you want to make an entire weekend trip out of it, you will probably want to get a hotel in either Boston or Providence. This will give you a lot of options for things to do on Saturday, and on gameday you can travel to it via the train or car. The downside to this is that the hotel prices can be pretty high if you go downtown. You can lower this cost for Boston if you stay somewhere further out and take the T in to the city (perhaps something like Quincy since it puts you closer to Gillette). This option is also closer to the airports (Logan in Boston or T.F. Green in Providence), which can be helpful if you are flying to the game.  If you are really only interested in the game, stay closer to Foxborough. This does limit your options for other things to do (the best thing to do in that area on Saturday would be to go to Patriot Place and check out the bars, restaurants, movie theater, bowling alley, and Patriots Hall of Fame). However, this will cut down on travel time to the game, and a lot of hotels in the area will run a shuttle to the game so you don't even need to worry about driving. Prices in this area are normally lower, but on a gameday they will go up.  If you want to spend $500+ a night you can stay at the Renaissance at Patriot Place. This is literally closer to the stadium than some of the parking lots and is a very nice, upscale hotel. You have great access to the amenities at Patriot Place, but the downside for this option is pretty obvious: it is super expensive.  Tailgating:    Everyone should tailgate when you attend a game. It's a huge part of the game day experience. It can be as simple (split a 6 pack with your buddy before heading in) or as elaborate (enjoy a dish tailored to the opponent while you watch the other games on a portable TV under the cover of a tent) as you want.   The most basic facts about tailgating are that in order to tailgate you need to drive to the stadium and you need to arrive early. Stadium lots open for tailgating 4 hours prior to the game (you can park earlier than that, but you can't start tailgating until then). Private lots vary, but you can usually start a little earlier than that. Show up early and have a great time getting ""lubed up"", but make sure to have a plan about who will be the DD to get home later. Also, if you are the DD you can get some free soda in the stadium.  Here is the official Gillette Stadium parking page. Keep in mind that private lots may have different policies, though they typically are pretty similar. Some of the more important items from this page:   Lots open for tailgating 4 hours before the game Lots close for tailgating 2 hours after the game A car costs $40 to park  Bring cash to pay for your parking Open fires are not permitted. Any fire you make needs to have a cover.   If you want a very comfortable tailgate experience for a large group, you can bring an RV. This offers a lot of nice things (i.e. bathroom, cover from elements, easy transport of food, room for a lot of tailgaters, etc), but can get expensive. Parking an RV in the stadium lots costs $150 and requires parking in the specific RV section (use entrances P10 N or P11 on the parking map). Some private lots have room for RVs as well, but you should check with them ahead of time.  Make sure to pack up your tailgate before heading in for the game. For one thing, you need to leave the area open for other cars or people to get through. For another, your stuff may get taken during the 4 hours you aren't around it (especially if it's alcohol). When you get back from the game, you can tailgate again for a couple of hours. This is a great way to avoid dealing with any traffic, and assuming it was a 1 PM game, you can have dinner and watch the late games on a portable TV.  The amount of things that people bring to their tailgates varies a lot, but the following are some options that you should consider:"
Patriots,3d5dac,Keyann,7,Mon Jul 13 17:34:14 2015 UTC,"Necessities:   Alcohol: Probably the most basic tailgating item. Beer is the most popular choice. This is much cheaper than in stadium beer. Food: Probably the #2 item in tailgating. Tailgating is a long process, and if you're drinking you'll want something to much on. Plus it is also much cheaper than food in the stadium. Popular items include chips, hamburgers, buffalo wings, steaks, and hot dogs, but some tailgaters will do more elaborate menus. This can even include tailoring the menu to the opponent (i.e. Cajun food for the Saints). Cooler: You want to keep your beer cold (as well as any cold food you have). Ice: For the cooler.   Basic Equipment:   Folding chairs: These allow you to sit down and relax while you enjoy your tailgate. They don't take up a ton of room, and some even come with cupholders. Folding table: Similar to the chairs, this allows you to spread out your food and drinks, without taking up a ton of space in your vehicle. Grill: Tailgating usually involves some sort of grilled food. If your vehicle isn't big enough to bring a full grill, there are a lot of smaller portable options that are quite cheap. You can also get a two burner stove, to allow you to cook things besides just grilling. Both of these examples use the 16 oz propane tanks, but there are small charcoal grills you can get as well. Bringing some sort of cooking device allows you to really up the quality of the food you enjoy during your tailgate.   Advanced Equipment:   Canopy: The parking spaces are the right size to put up a 10x10 canopy. The canopy is great for pretty much all weather. In the early season it gives you some shade, in rain/snow it keeps you dry, in cold/wind it helps keep you warm (you can get walls to attach to it as well), and it always ""defines your space"". The E-Z Up (or similar) canopies go up in just 1-2 minutes, with about the same amount of time to take down. Television: Because pretty much all NFL games are on Sunday, it's easy to miss all the action happening at other games while tailgating. Fortunately you can still watch them if you bring a TV to your tailgate. Some tailgaters with larger vehicles will have a 50 inch flatscreen TV in the rear of their vehicle that they watch the games on. If you are really committed, you can get portable satellite devices, but you can also just watch regional games that are broadcast over-the-air on a small portable TV and antenna.    Miscellaneous:   Games: Have something for your group to play during the tailgate. Popular options include tossing a football or playing cornhole. Extra lighters: Make sure you can start your fire/grill, though you probably can bum off someone around you if you have to. Extra propane/charcoal: You don't want to run out of fuel halfway through cooking. Disposable plates/silverware: Easy to dispose of when you're done eating. Paper towels: Keep stuff clean. Toiler paper: The portapotties often run out, so keep a roll in your car. You might not need it, but if you do you'll be grateful to have the backup. Water: Make sure to rehydrate after the game. Baby wipes: For cleaning up sticky spills Trash bags: Makes disposing of your trash much easier. You don't want to have to make a trip to one of their barrels every time you need to throw something away. Battery jumper pack/Jumper cables: In case you can't start your car (or your neighbor can't start his). You'll look like a hero if this becomes necessary and you have it.    There is a sub for this topic, though it's not as active as it could be: /r/tailgating   Going inside:    Make sure to get into the game a bit early. The lines at the gates can take 15 minutes to go through if you wait until too close to kickoff, and then you still need to get to your seats, which can take another 10 minutes if you're in the 300s. Try to make it to the gates a minimum of 30 minutes before kickoff, an hour is better.  There are 3 separate entrances, at the northeast, northwest, and southwest corners of the stadium. Check a map beforehand to figure out which entrance is most convenient for your seats.  During the Game:    The most important thing about being inside the stadium is to get loud when the other team is on offense. Particularly on third down, but don't limit it to that. A false start on first down is still valuable.  If your seats are up in the 300s, expect it to be a bit colder up there as it's exposed to the wind. Additionally, if you are up there, be aware that there is no connection across the north endzone on that level, so it might make more sense to cross over to the other ramp before you go up.  Because the field runs north-south, the sun sets on the visiting side first (a couple of hours ahead of home side). This is important in the middle months of October/November when there can be a 20 degree difference between sun and shade. The Patriots side will still be bathed in sunlight for an entire 1pm game but the visiting side (because of the height of the stadium and sun setting right behind visiting side) will be in shadow. So bring sunglasses if you are in the 300's on home side to a 1pm game and plan to put an extra layer or two on on the visiting side.  A lot of the time when the Pats get a first down the announcer will say ""and the play is good for a Patriots..."" that's your cue to yell ""FIRST! DOWN!"" and do the first down signal .  Other than this you should be quiet while the Pats are on offense.  The stadium stops selling beer 15 minutes after the second half starts.  Here is the list of things you can't bring in.  Be prepared for bathroom breaks to take a while, unless you go in the middle of a quarter. To limit this, go the bathroom before the game starts, and make a note of where the nearest bathroom is when you are heading to your seats. That way if you do have to go, you can get a little more quickly.  There are a lot of ATMs in the stadiums, but the lines can be even worse than the bathroom lines. Bring enough cash to avoid the need to use an ATM during the game. Most concession stands will take cards, but the hawkers walking around are cash based.  You can recharge your phone at some free charging stations in the stadium.  Staying Warm:    If the game you are attending is going to be cold, be sure to take precautions. A little prep work will make the experience much better. If you remember one thing from this section, it should be ""layers"". Layer everything. If turns out you have too much, you can always take off a layer. Note that the old wisdom about alcohol keeping you warm is only sort of correct: you will feel warmer  in your extremities because your blood is flowing more heavily, but this also means you are losing core body heat faster.   Body: Your innermost layer should be something that will wick the moisture away (you'll probably sweat a little), such as underarmor. You don't want that moisture to be near your skin when it starts to get cold. Make sure your outer layer is windproof. The difference that wind makes to your comfort is amazing. Stopping the wind will slow down your heat loss tremendously.  Between these two layers you should have several more, depending on how cold it will be. This all applies to both your shirts and your pants.  Hands: Mittens will be warmer than gloves. A good option is to wear a thing pair of gloves, and then a heavy pair of mittens over (this also allows you to stay a little warmer if you need to take off the mittens to use your fingers for something). Use the gap between the two to put some hand warmers. You should put hand warmers in a lot of other places too (notably your boots). Let the hand warmers heat up for a few minutes before putting them in your clothes; they need the air to work properly. Do not put handwarmers where they will directly touch your skin, they can get too hot if that is the case. These type of folding gloves are another option that let you keep use of your fingers when you need them, but without completely splitting up them up all the time.  Head: Make sure you have a good hat (or two). Your head gets a lot of blood, which means it can lose a lot of heat. Protecting your head will make a drastic difference in how cold you feel. Bring something to keep your face out of the cold as well (good options include a balaclava , which will help keep your ears and head warm at the same time).   Feet: If your feet get wet or cold (or both), your game will be miserable. Similar to the rest of your body, use layers. One pair of socks isn't enough. Make sure you wear several pairs of socks, and you can put handwarmers between the layers (by your toes is especially helpful). You need to avoid cotton socks: they will trap sweat by your feet. Wool socks are great, as are a lot of synthetic materials. Wear a good pair of winter boots; sneakers or other snows are not good enough. They should be warm and waterproof (in case of snow or sleet or just-above-freezing-rain)."
Patriots,3d5dac,gundam61,5,Mon Jul 13 17:35:39 2015 UTC,"Miscellaneous: There are a couple of non-clothing items you should consider bringing. One was already mentioned (handwarmers), but you should consider extras to switch out at halftime. Another is a blanket. When you are sitting down and being quiet while the offense is at work, throwing on the extra layer will feel great. Finally, you should consider bringing some cardboard or newspaper to use as insulation between you and the stadium. The concrete of the stadium will conduct heat (out of your body) much faster than newspaper or cardboard. Put a small patch between your feet and the ground and you'll slow this down. It's like making your boots that much thicker. You can also do this with your seat, but the plastic of the seats won't suck the cold out as quickly as the concrete.  Things to do while visiting Boston:    If you are visiting town for the game and want to do some other things while in Boston for the weekend, take a look at /r/boston or the WikiVoyage Page. There's a wide variety of other entertainment options, including museums, historical sites, nightlife, dining, and other sports venues."

Foxboro police block those roads off to anyone who doesn't live there.

Patriots,3d5dac,Dyruus,3,Tue Jul 14 12:38:20 2015 UTC,"Just got on the waiting list this year, I knew you could use their ticket exchange but I didn't know it was for face value. That's awesome, do you know if it's common to see good seats being sold on there?"
Patriots,3d5dac,buzzr309,2,Mon Jul 13 18:17:00 2015 UTC,"I've managed to get tickets to every regular season game via the exchange, but for popular games it's the been the day before, and sometimes in the 300s. You can definitely get good seats to games if you're willing to go to less popular ones, or on shorter notice."
Patriots,3d5dac,Dyruus,2,Mon Jul 13 18:25:21 2015 UTC,I'm flying in from Australia for the Jets game on the 25th of October. This will be my fourth Pats game and I've only ever once managed to get tickets through ticketmaster and that was Jets thanksgiving (butt fumble!).  I've been considering joining the waitlist but I worry about spending thousands to get to Boston only to not get tickets. If I don't get tickets on Wednesday should I just sign up or do you think Im better off going through stubhub?
Patriots,3d5dac,TSiev7,2,Tue Jul 14 00:06:02 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I believe you have to have a US address to sign up for the Wait List. Even if you could, if I were in your situation I would go ahead and pay the extra for Stubhub so that you know you have the tickets before flying halfway around the globe."

Patriots,3d5dac,RodgersOverrated,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:09:49 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. From a season ticket holder perspective, if I give my tickets to a friend or sell on a non-sanctioned [by the Pats] secondary exchange (StubHub, Craislist, etc...) then I, the season ticket holder, am liable for the person in my seats. If they get rowdy and tossed, I lose my season tickets. Seeing as a small amount of profit isn't worth that risk, I'm MUCH more likely to sell my tickets on the Exchange for face value than on a non-sanctioned secondary market."
Patriots,3d5dac,RodgersOverrated,2,Tue Jul 14 17:23:50 2015 UTC,"That's great, looks like I'll be going to a lot more games this year! The wait list is actually proving to be pretty worth it, considering the perks are essentially free or I should say included in the season tickets."
Patriots,3d5dac,RAANT,0,Tue Jul 14 17:25:51 2015 UTC,"Yup. It's definitely better than the Sox wait list in that regards. At least you get something while you wait.  I probably should have added to my previous comment that if someone gets tossed after they bought my tickets on the Exchange, I have no liability (and can keep my season tickets). It was implied, but just in case it wasn't obvious..."

A then-friend sold me the ticket and I went with him and 2 other friends. It was raining and cold up in the 300's and I was the only one who brought a poncho. The Patriots were getting stomped at half so after bitching and moaning for an entire half, and despite my wishes, the people I was with forced me to leave the game at half time with them. The entire walk back to the car, people shouted at us from route 1 ""The Patriots are coming back! Why would you leave the game?!"" They Patriots nearly came back from a huge deficit and though they still lost, I then vowed to never, under any circumstance, leave a game early. I also never talked to those ""friends"" ever again.   I've since met my girlfriend who's mother has been a season ticket holder for 20 years. I've been to many games in the last 2 years and I got to watch the Broncos and Browns games in 2013 which were some of the best comebacks I've ever seen. Go Pats!"

Patriots,3d5rtw,lionday,3,Tue Jul 14 04:39:13 2015 UTC,"Gost will be 32 by the time he hits free agency.   We let Vinatieri walk at 33 years old after applying the franchise tag the year prior and not doing it again.  Before we had Vinatieri we let Matt Bahr go at 38 or 39 (this was pre-Belichick though). He was only here a few years and was a rental.  I think he's gone in Free Agency, to be honest. Although, there's always the possibility of us getting Hernandez's dead money back from 2013, and we do still have about $10M left in cap room without that -- we certainly have the means to extend him if need be."
Patriots,3d5rtw,DCMurphy,5,Mon Jul 13 19:22:20 2015 UTC,"The big difference between Vinatieri and Gostkowski, though, is that Vinatieri had a big problem: his kickoffs weren't very good. Gostkowski's KOs still own."

I was at 2014 AFC Divisional Game against Colts, (where Blount got 4 TDs). I came out right by where the small convenience store where the Subway is. It's about a 10 minute walk to the stadium.

For me the absolute biggest difference is what's happening AWAY from the ball. When I'm at the game, I only spend about 10% of my ""eye"" energy on the ball. I love watching battles like Revis against his receiver, or watching McCourty read the play. Or watching Linebackers fill holes, or the ""trench battles"". These are things you can ONLY see in person. TV shows you one thing - the ball. In the QB's hand, in the RB's hand, or in the WR's hand. That's it. Yes, it's in HD and you get slo-mo and replay. But you don't actually get to watch the game. That is something you can only get in attendance.  Tl/DR: Go to a game. Don't watch the ball."

TB12 will show more competitiveness in games. (roughly +25% increase efficiency in the competitive engine) We have reviewed the TB12 health and sanity subroutines and found no problems with them. We expect the software to be relevant for another 3-5 years before a changeover will be required. We respect that some users have felt dejected after TB12 was able to circumvent their firewalls and safeguards yet again, however we feel this is a crucial aspect of the software and will not be changed. Many of our users have felt that TB12 was not mobile enough, so we've put in a lot of work with QA to ensure our new software will be more mobile than ever, specifically we've increased awareness about 10%, sliding ability about 15%, and scrambling about 40%.   While we respect that there are many users that believe we have overtuned our TB12 software, we want to assure our users that we have not overtuned any aspects intentionally, and although user have called for us to ""nerf"", or reduce, certain aspects TB12 so as to give our competitors a chance, we feel it is in the best interest of all parties to leave our software where it is and as our competitors to elevate their own software to a comparable level, instead of intentionally hampering our own.

He was the ultimate ""Stats > Team Success"" player.  Also, despite winning a Superbowl (with ample help from Desmond Howard and Reggie white), he still managed to be probably the most epic choke artist of all time.

Patriots,3czhe3,AleredEgo,10,Sun Jul 12 07:21:05 2015 UTC,"Calling a pass wasn't a bad play.  Here's where it's bad play calling: ""First action, push Brandon Browner back into the path of the Butler.  After Browner gets pushed backwards..."""
Patriots,3czhe3,Fluffinho,7,Sun Jul 12 11:17:38 2015 UTC,"The assignment wasn't to push Browner at all, his job was to pick Butler leaving Lockette uncovered. The play call itself was good but the execution on defense was perfect. The percentage chance of that play being an interception is unfeasibly low. IIRC we're talking less than 5%."
Patriots,3czhe3,AleredEgo,4,Sun Jul 12 12:23:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you are saying, but the idea of getting past Browner On the goalline is crazy to me.  Butler made a once in a lifetime play on the ball, but if I see Browner involved and the play involves being physical, I'm calling an audible.  Edit: Also, more than 95% of the time, someone is supposed to get off a Browner jam at the goal line to get in someone's way?  What is the context and source for that stat?"
Patriots,3czhe3,Fluffinho,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:36:26 2015 UTC,"You're being too specific. 95% of the time, that play call on short yardage, goal to go situations will not result in an interception.   Browner being there is not on the play callers, it's on Wilson to call the audible."

I'll leave the rest of my comment even though I want to apologize for being dumb.   Original reply:  Yeah, that was kind of my point.  Saying 95% not intercepted infers so many variables are different.  Browner was there, Seattle wideouts popped up balls for interceptions multiple times in the play-offs, clock was running down how often in the 95% of the time?  Seems like a useless stat for what was actually a specific situation. Edit 1: (redacted)"

Patriots,3czhe3,bukkakeberzerker,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:35:18 2015 UTC,"He doesn't have to move Browner, he just has to hold him in roughly the same position. The idea being Butler would have taken a step, and then have to cut back in, going out around the pick, which would allow the receiver just that extra step for the reception.   Instead, Butler stood still for that fraction of a second to get a read, and cut directly in to the ball, essentially saving two steps, and putting him one step ahead of the receiver.   EDIT: re watching  it, 83 (Seahawks dude) even gave a little shoulder fake to the outside, this would reinforce the defenders instinct of ""I've gotta get up on this guy and cover him"". Butler really went all in on the inside route, and I think if it had indeed been an outside play, we'd all be crying over ""that scrub rookie Butler"" and what a dumb call it was by BB to put a rookie in at that time, etc. Of course, Butler could have been looking at Browner's coverage to see if his receiver made a route, or just picked him. If he picked, inside, if not, outside. I think we can play the if/or game all day; ultimately, it was a risky, but damn good read by Butler."
Patriots,3czhe3,pulsepulsebeep,6,Sun Jul 12 18:07:41 2015 UTC,"In post-game interviews, Butler says he practiced this exact play in the weeks leading up to the Superbowl and got burned. He was coached afterwards to do exactly what he did, which is to immediately take the inside man. Any delay or reaction time and he almost definitely doesn't make it there in time. Awesome confidence by Butler to stick to the assignment, considering the stakes at the time."
Patriots,3czhe3,itsNOSAJ,2,Sun Jul 12 20:36:11 2015 UTC,Tbh I feel like Browner didn't do much. He didn't block. He got pushed backwards. If anything he was just an obstacle.
Patriots,3czhe3,AleredEgo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:10:41 2015 UTC,"It looked to me like his feet started a half yard into the endzone and when the pass left the QBs hands, his feet were once again a half yard into the endzone.  He didn't allow a release into a route and clearly, he allowed Butler a route to the ball.  Also, he made sure  there was no way he was going to get penalized.  Maybe after the 500th viewing, I'm seeing things that aren't there."
Patriots,3czhe3,itsNOSAJ,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:37:08 2015 UTC,I don't believe there was supposed to be a release. It was a straight pick play. He wanted to get caught by Browner.
Patriots,3czhe3,Fluffinho,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:04:28 2015 UTC,"The receiver covered by Browner (can't remember who it was) isn't running a route to catch a pass, his job is to get in Butler's way. So while it may not look like Browner is doing much, by locking up his guy he actually plays it perfectly. He may get pushed back but that doesn't matter, they're expecting a push, that's why Butler plays off Lockette, he now has space to work around Browner."

Patriots,3czhe3,LooRead,5,Sun Jul 12 16:31:51 2015 UTC,"does anyone else get uncomfortable watching hightower come in at the last moment and get his hands on the ball while butler is falling to the ground? I know he was just trying to help malcolm hang onto the pass, but he could have easily punched it out on accident"
Patriots,3czhe3,Teutonicfox,3,Sun Jul 12 13:19:15 2015 UTC,i think its more that he wanted butler to stay in the endzone for a touchback.
Patriots,3czhe3,ioncloud9,-2,Sun Jul 12 15:47:53 2015 UTC,"It wouldnt have been a touchback, I think it would have been a safety."
Patriots,3czhe3,krakah293,4,Sun Jul 12 17:13:17 2015 UTC,Man.. Looking at this for probably the 1000th time... Had Wilson thrown back shoulder it would have been 6 points and we'd be calling for Butlers head for being a ball hawk rather than make a tackle.

Patriots,3czhe3,Five_Against_1,4,Sun Jul 12 15:57:36 2015 UTC,You gotta believe he said that in an attempt to reel in his blatant euphoria at the prospect that the Pats were about to lose.  Glad he ended up eating a big ol' bag of shit that night.
Patriots,3czhe3,mattsparrow,4,Sun Jul 12 18:46:18 2015 UTC,"The best part of rewatching this is the play recognition. Lockette does a cute little jump step to the side to try and get Butler moving one way before he takes off to get the ball. Unfortunately for him Butler has recognized the play. All he does is watch. Had he taken a step to the same direction before pivoting, then the completion would have likely been made or at best an incompletion. Instead, the moment he sees the other guy start to turn so he can run past Kearse he takes off. On top of that instead of just taking off to disrupt Lockettes route, he heads straight to where the ball is going and beats Lockette there, intercepting the ball and making him look silly as he flies through the air.  Just amazing cognizance of the play."

Patriots,3czhe3,mustachepantsparty,2,Sun Jul 12 22:31:00 2015 UTC,I am so accustomed to disappointment in that kind situation my heart sinks every time Wilson drops back and Lockette appears to be open for that split second. Then it's relief.
Patriots,3czhe3,Vermonster_802,58,Mon Jul 13 14:42:21 2015 UTC,Now it's time to start the drive for 5.  My favorite potential future stat is that if the Patriots repeat this year and Brady gets his 5th ring at SB50 he'll have won 10% of all super bowls ever played.
Patriots,3czhe3,chemistryundergrad,50,Sun Jul 12 06:07:15 2015 UTC,The thought of Goodell having to present the SB50 winning Patriots with the Lombardi trophy is an instant smile.
Patriots,3czhe3,NEWENGLANDahh,11,Sun Jul 12 06:33:09 2015 UTC,Add Warner to that list too
Patriots,3czhe3,mattsparrow,4,Sun Jul 12 07:40:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by that. Watching the post game ceremony last year, it seemed to me that Warner was really moved and happy to be handing the trophy to Brady. Looked like one of the happiest moments of his life just to be out there on the field, and if anything it showed he has a tremendous amount of respect for Brady.  Hell even Faulk was cool about it."
Patriots,3czhe3,bukkakeberzerker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:12:16 2015 UTC,"It probably was a bit of a relief. For the past few years they might have been thinking ""oh man, that pats got lucky a few years in a row, and we were their first win. If we had just beat them then, they would never have won any superbowls, because morale and blah blah.""  What they got was confirmation that the QB that beat them was and still is one of the best players of all time."
Patriots,3czhe3,Cmarksthespot,2,Sun Jul 12 18:19:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone thought we got lucky a few years in a row. Players respect that it's incredibly difficult to win one super bowl, let alone 3 out of 4"
Patriots,3czhe3,bukkakeberzerker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:28:03 2015 UTC,"Perhaps. I'd say it's more ""confirmation"" that they got beat, fair and square, and the guy who ended their potential dynasty, went on to end another potential dynasty. It's like losing a light-saber fight to Darth Vader, vs Darth Maul. Vader was the ultimate badass, and if he beat you, well, there's no shame in losing that battle. Maul was just some scrub who used a trick saber and ninja shit to cheese his opponents."

Patriots,3czhe3,salamander-,7,Sun Jul 12 05:52:53 2015 UTC,so if went down into the endzone right there.. would it have been a touchback?
Patriots,3czhe3,fierruda,10,Sun Jul 12 10:26:57 2015 UTC,"Yes. For it to have been a safety, Malcolm would've had to get out of the endzone, then, on his own volition, have gone back in and have been tackled. Obviously Malcolm didn't think of just taking a touchback since he had just made the biggest play on the biggest stage in American Sports, and was pretty much just focusing on holding onto the ball."
Patriots,3czhe3,salamander-,3,Sun Jul 12 10:40:10 2015 UTC,no.. totally. probably didnt want said one of the biggest plays in sports history taken away from him because of inches and some technicality. just wanted to get as far out of the endzone as possible. I get it. but I was curious if his one foot in the endzone would be enough for him to have got a safety.. thanks!
Patriots,3czhe3,AleredEgo,2,Sun Jul 12 11:12:29 2015 UTC,"I believe the NFL rules are where the ball is, not where the feet are as far as safeties go."

Patriots,3czhe3,Pats_Fan,8,Sun Jul 12 10:16:24 2015 UTC,He's actually covered by Collins behind him that will have enough time to get there if Wilson floats the pass. If not the guy on the edge attempts to bat the pass down and contain. Essentially they were more worried about wilson running outside.

Don't care to see them on the field, I'm not more or less excited at the game due to them being there, to do some lame dance routine at the 2 minute warning and on the sidelines. I think the NFL shouldn't have them.  If they really need to have pretty girls running around in team colors, have something like the ice girls that the NHL has, and pay them like the other event staff."

Patriots,3cwmn6,DunDerD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:04:12 2015 UTC,That ad was created after the wells report in context came out and was pretty obviously referencing it

Patriots,3cwmn6,yalemartin,3,Sat Jul 11 14:22:19 2015 UTC,"The court will evaluate if the NFL violated CBA protocol. It will be a trial of the process, not a review of the conclusion."
Patriots,3cwmn6,yalemartin,4,Sat Jul 11 18:11:42 2015 UTC,"Most don't realize it's a high bar to challenge in court a process already negotiated. The Brady circumstances however are unique. He also  doesn't lack firepower and resources to dig up case law.  It's a different state and somewhat dissimilar, but the Missouri Supreme Court has already concluded the current NFL structure is irregular and unfair:  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2015/05/06/missouri-supreme-court-issues-ruling-that-could-limit-roger-goodells-disciplinary-powers/  Additionally, Goodell delegating to Vincent, then, after the fact, claiming it's his decision looks shady or inept at best.  I could be a tad bias though..."
Patriots,3cwmn6,yalemartin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"You are correct. The league made lots of mistakes on the surface alone. However it would take an error that the courts view as egregious for them to intervene - something they're willing to do roughly 1% of the time in reviewing labor arbitration.  I am not entirely clear on what happens afterwards but I do know the fight doesn't end there. In the unlikely even they overrule Goodell's arbitration decision, the league won't let Tom 'go free'. Through another process he'll likely be punished differently."
Patriots,3cwmn6,afxjzs,0,Sun Jul 12 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"However it would take an error that the courts view as egregious for them to intervene   You're overstating a lot. It would only take an error or an irregularity. Vincent taking on the commissioner's role alone stands out big.   In the unlikely even they overrule Goodell's arbitration decision, the league won't let Tom 'go free'. Through another process he'll likely be punished differently.   No way... your bias is showing,"
Patriots,3cwmn6,Kevin_Jim,2,Sun Jul 12 21:39:18 2015 UTC,Courts intervene less than 1% of the time in arbitration disputes. I don't think a historical 1% probability can be overstated.
Patriots,3cwmn6,PacmanZ3ro,2,Mon Jul 13 02:00:31 2015 UTC,Historically fines for ball tampering were $20k and noncooperation were $50k
Patriots,3cwmn6,sugar_free_haribo,5,Mon Jul 13 23:17:05 2015 UTC,"Goodell himself violated the CBA, more than once."
Patriots,3cwmn6,MaigoULTD,2,Sun Jul 12 02:01:33 2015 UTC,"partially true. I got this info from my friend who is a lawyer in MN, but I trust what he says.   According to what he told me, Brady's team could actually challenge the entirety of the report since the report was the basis for the punishment. They would essentially be challenging the report on the basis that it does not meet the preponderance of evidence standard set out in the CBA and would thus be an unfair punishment. He seemed to think this would be a weak approach however on the basis that a judge could potentially find it ~50/50 (50.1 needed for preponderance of the evidence standard) and if it's close enough will default to the NFL's decision."
Patriots,3cwmn6,Bigbohn,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:58:24 2015 UTC,Yea and the cba provides that the league must meet a preponderance standard of proof. Therefore the facts of the case and conclusions of the wells report will be considered.

Patriots,3cwmn6,Bigbohn,5,Sat Jul 11 14:13:23 2015 UTC,"I think he said ""ending the rhetoric."" This is technically rhetoric, is it not? I mean it is certainly advancing the arguments -- and I am glad he is going it, but seems to be different than what he was saying a month or so ago.   The definition of rhetoric is ""the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing."" Wells in Context is an effort in just that - -good for the Pats."
Patriots,3cwmn6,mcorcoran3,2,Sat Jul 11 16:00:29 2015 UTC,He did take the steam out of the New England fanbase so it had the effect he wanted. Got the fanbase to focus on Brady's appeal and eventual court case and move on from the 1 million dollar fine and loss of draft picks.
Patriots,3cwmn6,RankInsubordination,2,Sat Jul 11 16:04:54 2015 UTC,"Agreed. His press conference served its purpose -- though technically adding to the Wells Report is ""continuing the rhetoric."" But they are going it quetly -- no pressers, or leaks etc..."

Patriots,3cxlwc,TheMagicianDolph,3,Sat Jul 11 18:19:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Austrian Football League's championship game is called the Austrian Bowl.   Here's the link to the /r/NFL post and here's /u/Luckynumberlucas (OP) comment about the bowl   I know y'all love some offseason football, you ask we serve.  The Swarco Raiders from Innsbruck, Austria face off against their hated rivals from Austria's capital, the Vienna Vikings.  Both teams made it to the playoffs without breaking much of a sweat and both teams won their respective home game against todays opponent.  The Vikings have won the title 3 years in a row (all against the Raiders), however lost many key players last offseason, they're led by 20 year-old QB Thury in his first year as a starter.  The Raiders came in second in domestic and european competition since they won both titles back in 2011, theteam is rejuvenated and hungry to bring the title back to their hometown and are led by QB Sean Shelton and a stellar defense, also the Raiders have a cooperation with the Oakland Raiders where the Europeans send over coaches and staff to intern to further elevate the level of coaching expertise, etc. For the 2011 European football bowl title game Willie Brown and some Raiderettes came to visit. Pretty cool stuff.  Level of play is comparable to DIV 2 and on a (very) good day low-level FCS teams, all players except the Raiders QB are amateur players (like in NCAA) highlights from last years Austrian Bowl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im8vX3tfgiY   Rosters and further information are available on www.raiders.at and viennavikings.com  Hit me up if you got any questions!"

I also had Olawakandi as the center (who joined the Celtics in 2007 for a minute). Sort of freaked me out when it happened 7 years later.   Although my PG was Jason Williams ...
Patriots,3cw2ws,hifromsandiego86,3,Sat Jul 11 19:31:24 2015 UTC,"3 nights after the superbowl I had a dream of seeing a highlightvideo of tom brady after Superbowl 56.  basicelly we won 50 against the cowboys, lost 54 against rodgers(i am not sure if he was still a packer) and won 55 against the panthers & 56 against the 49ers. sadly no Watt was there but maybe his part in it all when into your dream?"
Patriots,3cw2ws,wild_n_devout,4,Sat Jul 11 21:40:42 2015 UTC,"I think I like the sound of your dream better.   I just had a funny thought... I wonder if there was someone back in the late 90's who woke up one day and said, ""Whoa, I just had a dream that the Pats are gonna win the Super Bowl 3 times within the next few years. Crazy, huh?""   Then their mind was blown a few years later. :)"
Patriots,3cw2ws,gagnonca,0,Sun Jul 12 01:59:27 2015 UTC,"It got weired thought. The last part of the dream was Brady playing as a 49er in Candlestick with Bill, Bradshaw in steelers uniform & montana in 49er uniform looking on.  kind of like the ending of return of the jedi."
Patriots,3cw2ws,PatricksPub,3,Sun Jul 12 13:27:19 2015 UTC,well did watt win as patriot ?? coz after KC game last year there were all kind of rumors that brady might end up in houston :( i hate that.
Patriots,3cw2ws,mcorcoran3,4,Sat Jul 11 22:45:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he was in a Pats uniform and we won the Super Bowl.   In my dream it must've been several years from now, because the announcers kept mentioning the Steelers and comparing their Lombardi amount to the Pats. So, I got the impression that the Pats were either going to tie the Steelers' 6 or pass it.  I also had a dream once that Russell Wilson was playing as the Pats QB years from now. That dream didn't involve a Super Bowl win, though. It was just him playing as Pats QB and Brady was retired. That one was more of a nightmare, though, because Tom wasn't our QB anymore. I was happy to wake up from that one.   The one where we won another SB was awesome, though. Very vivid, too, like watching an actual game. I wish I could have dreams like that on demand. :)"

Its not a given that rookies will improve the next year. And even if we improve, we had an O-line that was ranked 31st in pass blocking last season by PFF and if you don't place stock in PFF, it was at the very least an O-line that was so awful that McDaniels didn't even call running plays in the playoffs against good D-lines (Not to mention Seattle was playing their 2nd string DTs because their starters got injured).

While, hopefully, Nate Solder will have a good year - no life threatening ailment and all.  Generally, we'll probably have a solid OL. Though, I sure hope we go big with Evan Mathis (which is unlucky)."
Patriots,3cszfj,kksred,0,Sat Jul 11 10:42:38 2015 UTC,"Again. By your logic, the Rams should have a solid O-line because they invested so many picks at the O-line.    The first 4 games were awful anyway you cut it. They just were. Our OL was worst than a revolving door. After that, it stabalised at decent.   Like I said, the 31st ranking was for the whole season. Besides, PFF gives the starters the grades and averages them. So the first 4 games only affect the grades of the guys who started the first 4 games."
Patriots,3cszfj,Kevin_Jim,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:36:51 2015 UTC,"First, I don't care about the Rams. Second, last time I checked BB was the HC for the Patriots, not the Rams. Last year BB (and Scar) drafted Stork in the 4th round, and he ended up stabilising our OL.  I don't see a reason we can't do the same with Tre' Jackson (who's very good against the pass) and Shaq Mason (amazing against the run). At worst, we can always get Dan Connolly and let both Jackson and Mason develop.  Solder, Jackson/Kline, Stork/Wendel(/David Andrews?), Wendel/Shaq/Kline, Volmer/Fleming/Cannon (the only position Cannon doesn't suck). That's a solid OL, not great, but solid."
Patriots,3cszfj,kksred,0,Sat Jul 11 16:19:02 2015 UTC,"Because college production always translates into NFL production amirite?   And BB isn't an O-line coach so I don't know what great impact you think he'll have on the O-line. And its not like the Patriots haven't drafted busts at the O-line position before. Heck we cut Halapio before training camp was halfway done last year.  Besides, Tre Jackson has a knee issue so we don't even know if he'll be healthy."
Patriots,3cszfj,Kevin_Jim,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:21:58 2015 UTC,"Time will tell. I'd rather be optimistic and think our OL will protect the GOAT instead of being terrified of the monstrous DLs of AFCE.  The one thing I can't be optimistic, is our suckendery. Unless Butler ends up being the next Sherman (in terms of been overlooked/production) and Darryl Roberts is the next Butler, our secondary will suffer.  Again, I am not(!) compering Butler to Sherman. Just saying that Butler needs to step up, big time. Otherwise we are screwed."
Patriots,3cszfj,vgman20,0,Sat Jul 11 18:50:43 2015 UTC,It's fine if you say you are hopeful but I just dont agree with saying that we already have a solid O-line without even knowing who a starter is on a line that was terrible last year.
Patriots,3cszfj,kksred,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"Our OL was terrible at the beginning of last year and average(ish) towards the end. I look forward to them being solid this year with the rookies, Fleming stepping up and, hopefully, Stork having a year two jump.  We'll see. Training camp is a couple of weeks away."
Patriots,3cszfj,vgman20,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:26:45 2015 UTC,Our line was solid later in the year. They played well against the fearsome pass rush of Baltimore and were instrumental in the last few drives in the Superb Owl
Patriots,3cszfj,kksred,0,Sat Jul 11 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"What game were you watching lol? Brady was getting hit after every pass. He didn't take any sacks because of how quickly he was getting rid of the ball. We literally stopped trying deep passes because the pocket collapsed before the routes developed. In the Seattle game, the O-line was getting murdered until Avril went out with a concussion. We had no running game. You must have a different definition of solid because this isn't it."
Patriots,3cszfj,vgman20,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"Actually, our running game was good in the beginning of the super bowl. In the first quarter, I'm 99% sure Blount had more yards than Lynch; he was getting ~5 yards per rush consistently. The running game slowed down because we were behind so we needed to start passing more.   And it's impressive for an O-Line to create a window in the pocket for the QB to step into every play for 2 or 3 drives against any defensive line in the NFL.   About the Ravens game, Brady wasn't getting hit that often, especially when you consider how strong that defensive line was. Brady was throwing the ball quick to avoid getting hit, yes, but he was also (and primarily) throwing the ball quick because we were down with little time left on the clock.   Also, let's not forget about the Colts games. People like the laugh about the Colts run D, but if you take out the Pats games, they statistically have a very average run D."

Brady was throwing the ball quick to avoid getting hit, yes, but he was also (and primarily) throwing the ball quick because we were down with little time left on the clock.   Wait wut. I don;t understand that logic. We were throwing short passes instead of long passes because we were running out of time? Do you understand how football works?    Also, let's not forget about the Colts games. People like the laugh about the Colts run D, but if you take out the Pats games, they statistically have a very average run D.   The Colts were selling out to stop the pass. You'd have noticed it especially in our regular season match up. One of our most effective play action plays involves sending a pulling guard to make it seem like a run. The 2nd pick Brady threw that game came when nobody blocked the pulling guard and went straight for sacking Brady. If that was a run, it would have gone for a lot of yards. They sacrificed the run to stop the Patriots from beating them through the pass."
Patriots,3cszfj,Dharmasabitch,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:42:39 2015 UTC,"we averaged less than 3 YPC   That stat doesn't tell the whole story. As I said, we had a strong running attack at the beginning of the game, but we fell behind so we switched to a more pass-heavy attack. Once that happened, we ran primarily on short yardage situations to move the chains, so it was largely runs down the middle against a stacked box to get a few yards; in other words, even though we didn't have big runs, the running game did its job for the most part.   And we didn't do that.   I'm not sure what to tell you other than to watch the game again. The last few drives of the super bowl, brady consistently had a lane to step up into. Basically every play, Brady would drop back, the line would force the rush upfield, Brady would step up and make a pass. That's not an easy thing to do against any NFL caliber front 7.   We were throwing short passes instead of long passes because we were running out of time?   That's not what I said. I said we were throwing quick passes. Look at any game where the Patriots orchestrate a comeback from the last few season. As we're trying to catch Up, Brady spends less and less time holding on to the ball, because you need to execute plays quickly. Brady isn't a deep ball QB, he doesn't make a comeback by hanging in the pocket for 10 seconds and then bombing the ball downfield. He makes a ton of passes where he only hangs onto the ball for a few seconds before throwing  because it's more efficient for him."

Was it just me or was there something different in the 4th quarter about the Seahawks D-line? Oh wait. I remember! They lost Avril and were already down 2 starting DTs!

When you're down and running out of time you try to throw deeper passes to conserve time or stop clock on incompletions. The fact that we still stuck to short passes wasn't because of time issues. It was because that was the gameplan due to our O-line.   Sigh. I don't know what to tell you. The first turnover of the game was because Bennett came in untouched to take Brady's head off. If you want to be delusional and claim we still had a good O-line, be my guest. Not paying much credence to PFF is one thing but completely disagreeing with their grades and saying the opposite is true is just stupid and arguing with stupid is a waste of time."

Patriots,3cszfj,kksred,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:54:50 2015 UTC,"We abandoned the run game in the 1st quarter twice in the playoffs. When your O-line inspires so little confidence that you have to do that as an O-coord, thats all you need to know about our O-line. We took so few deep shots and resorted to a quick passing game where we exploited the cover 3 with slant flats and curl flats in the SB.   And our O-line was much better in 2012 and slightly better in 2013. 2012 was a great year for our O-line with Connolly, Wendell and Mankins playing well with Solder and Vollmer killing it at tackle. What we have now is a ghost of that line."
Patriots,3cszfj,abmmm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:39:17 2015 UTC,I think abandoning the run game had more to so with the Ravens and Hawks having two of the best run Ds last year.

Patriots,3ctqwk,lewlkewl,2,Sat Jul 11 05:25:28 2015 UTC,"No, Goodell is obviously a smart person. He saw an opportunity to keep the NFL in the media, make the fans of 31 teams very happy, boost sales during a period where sales falter, and deflect attention away from the Hardy/Peterson cases. He doesn't want wife beating in the news, instead he wants the fans to think he caught a player cheating and is laying the law down.   Of course ESPN is going to comply to his wishes and focus more on DeflateGate than the other stuff. Why? Well they wouldn't want to upset the provider of one of their biggest prime time products (MNF), among other things. I guess another example of ESPN bending over backwards for the NFL is when they suspended Simmons for talking shit about Goodell for the Ray Rice incident."

In the short run, sure, it'll boost sails and the goose will keep producing golden eggs. Until it doesn't and NBA will take over. I wouldn't call that smart, only opportunistic."
Patriots,3ctqwk,Kevin_Jim,-4,Sun Jul 12 11:12:22 2015 UTC,I don't have a problem with people not doing the research on the Carolina bench law rules. Or ignoring the fact that Hardy was the one who called 911 because he was moving her out and she lost it. Or that when she gave her testimony she was coked out. Or that the claim of a payoff came from the prosecutor who was angry that his case was being thrown out. Or that even if all the accusations are completely true that it's (wrongly or not) supposed to be a 2 game punishment based on what was collectively bargained.  But if people aren't going to do that homework there can't be an expectation that fans of the other 31 teams are going to dig into the Ideal Gas Law and which test gauge was actually used.
Patriots,3ctqwk,Nation911,7,Fri Jul 10 21:39:48 2015 UTC,"Hardy was found guilty in the court of law. While the only think a circus report managed to construct, was a more probable than not that Brady was generally aware.  Yes, NFL's standard for punishment is ""more probable than not"" BUT that is a ""more probable than not generally aware"". Aka not even related to it. And that's by disregarding the lead witness' (the ref) testimony.  So yes, a convicted for domestic violence player should never, ever be in the same boat as a icon and crown-jewel of the freaking league for the past 15 years! Ever... and over what? Air?  Come one..."

Patriots,3ctqwk,Kevin_Jim,16,Fri Jul 10 23:00:25 2015 UTC,The lazy media hot take is that Beating Women = Deflating footballs. The actual interesting takeaway is that the NFL is still giving Hardy double the punishment of what was collectively bargained at the time of the incident.
Patriots,3ctqwk,Nation911,11,Fri Jul 10 18:56:42 2015 UTC,"So what, they are giving Brady quadruple the punishment of maybe being aware of someone maybe deflating some footballs which science has definitively said didn't happen."

He had Gonzalez, team traded up for Julio, White as his second receiver etc. If course he has better stats. That's all he has going for him.  His playoff stats are just bad. A few one and done seasons and a playoff run where he ended up choking against the 49ers in the second half at home. Flacco has consistently done solid in the playoffs."

I just think that since Jim Irsay lobbied the NFL rules committee after that one playoff loss (I believe it was 2003) , the rules for PI's/Illegal Contact have been ridiculous. Especially last season."

Patriots,3cshb7,ihateconnecticut,2,Fri Jul 10 13:49:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and it seems like these days the refs will call PI on just about any missed, deep ball with a defender nearby, especially if that defender happens to be, I dunno, let's say Brandon Browner. It's almost to the point where QB's, unless they're Tom Brady, should just throw every single ball deep and to hell with anyone actually catching it, just let the refs play for you. Tom, on the other hand, would get called for intentional grounding. Fuck the refs."

Patriots,3ctsyh,Mel_Gibsons_Sanity,8,Fri Jul 10 22:45:36 2015 UTC,There isn't a shred of evidence that Brady or anyone with the Patriots did anything wrong.   All the ball pressure was explained and the texts were from months and months prior without any sort of context that would imply guilt.   Brady was suspended because of the media spin and because the NFL doesn't think the Patriots suffered enough after Spygate. I don't think he deserves to be suspended for that.
Patriots,3ctsyh,Fuqwon,10,Fri Jul 10 19:25:48 2015 UTC,"The main reason is because Goodell is sacrificing Brady to win back the public. Bounty gate? Fucked it up entirely... Adrian Peterson? Fucked it up royally... Greg Hardy? Fucked it up from the start... Ray Rice? Fucked it up intentionally... He has been losing points with the public, and he knows any punishment against the Pats will be met with strong support from the idiot nfl fan who gobbles up ESPN headlines for dessert with their thumbs planted firmly in their asses."
Patriots,3ctsyh,PatricksPub,5,Fri Jul 10 21:42:44 2015 UTC,"That's why the NFL leaked deliberately false information to color the publics perception of the situation. They have enough people on their side because of how much people already hate the Pats that they would accept anything no matter how false it is. No matter what happens short of exoneration will be fully supported by those people. That's why this is going to end like the Bountygate player suspensions. They are going to uphold some sort of suspension, Brady will take them to court and the court will once again eviscerate the NFL's whole disciplinary process."
Patriots,3ctsyh,skyfire23,7,Fri Jul 10 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"No, for the sake of precedent if not for the obvious reason of Brady's innocence in this farce/debacle."

If you think Brady is guilty, then maybe 1 game because the precedent for this infraction is merely a fine, and to bump that up to multiple games for a first time offender (Brady had zero to do with spygate so yes, if guilty, this is a first offense) is ludicrous."
Patriots,3ctsyh,zwimberger,5,Fri Jul 10 18:47:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. Also, I feel like Brady is trying to clear up his reputation that was clearly damaged by this so no way would be ok with this."

No player, has ever been suspended in the past when a similar offense has arisen. The minimum fine is 25k team fine, I realize that is the minimum, but the team has already been fined 40 times that amount, and then a 1st round draft pick on top of that. Even a single game would cost Brady roughly 18 times that amount for a first offense. Neither policy nor precedent support anything near the punishments that have been handed down."
Patriots,3ctsyh,CasperCalls,6,Fri Jul 10 20:21:28 2015 UTC,"No. if the basis for reducing the suspension is that he didnt do anything wrong, then why would they suspend him at all?"

Patriots,3ctsyh,JustinC00,5,Fri Jul 10 23:04:06 2015 UTC,"NFL completely fucked themselves on this one, it will be one of the reasons why the court will throw out the suspension.  It is shocking over the incompetence of that one. Here you have a player in the same investigation do the same thing as Brady and no punishment. Then you have Favre who did the exact same thing only be fined, yet one of the reasons for the suspension is non-cooperation. Which btw the dipshit wells didn't have subpoena power.  Also let's not forget how the fucking idiot who issued the punished, troy vincent per the CBA had no legal standing to hand out the punishment.

But in reality, when Goodell can just do whatever the fuck he wants, I'd settle for 1 game.  In a way though, I'd say absolutely not.  Goodell is playing the game that our legal system frequently does.  Not a lot of evidence so you levy a not-so-large penalty, 4 games.  If there was a ton of incriminating evidence he'd push for a harsher penalty.  If he were to say, lower the suspension to 1 game, that would show that he knows his case holds no water but it may not be worth Brady's time to take him to court.  It's pretty scummy.  I'm not sure what message he'd be sending by offering a 1 game suspension other than ""I don't want to look wrong but I'm fairly wrong."""
Patriots,3ctsyh,Vinnys_Magic_Grits,2,Fri Jul 10 20:23:02 2015 UTC,Goodell can't do whatever the fuck he wants. That's why Brady hired the lawyer who always beats Goodell in actual court.

Patriots,3ctsyh,JustinC00,4,Fri Jul 10 23:22:58 2015 UTC,Federal Court will throw the suspension out based on multiple fuck ups by the NFL.  Vincent legally couldn't hand out the punishment.  The only punishment in goodell's tenure for not cooperating with a league investigation was a fine. Not a 4 game suspension.  Also the wells report which is what  the NFL based the punishment on has more holes than swiss cheese.   Not to mention a huge case of defamation by the NFL on Brady.

Patriots,3cpeui,ctpatsfan77,10,Thu Jul 9 20:01:47 2015 UTC,"Three reasons.     Stories get and stay in the national consciousness when there are two plausible sides to the story with murky evidence. (E.g., if a vengeful cop guns down an innocent kid, its not a national story.  But if you have this scenario where the unarmed kid may have been attacking the cop or may have been running away or surrendering; then you have a big national story that everyone wants more details on.) Deflategate falls into that category.  The evidence is murky as hell.  The readings on a few balls seem a tad lower than ideal gas law (even if the average perfectly fits), plus the McNally ""deflator""/""not going to espn"" messages from 2014 offseason.  People can honestly believe either side is ""obviously"" right, based on previous prejudices.  The Cardinals story didn't have this; there's clear evidence of guilt somewhere in their front office. The NFL convinced itself Brady/Pats were guilty from the start, and has a history of these witch hunts under Goodell (Deflategate, Bullygate, Bountygate, Spygate), where the evidence really wasn't there -- except in Spygate where we broke the memo about filming on the field during games and fully owned up to it -- granted the rule has been broken by other teams afterwards but no one cares because it wasn't of defensive signals.  Baseball doesn't have this; it has a commissioner who isn't trying to denigrate his own sport. The Cardinals ""hacking"" scandal should blow over.  The Cardinals and Astros had bad security practices where passwords were either logged or shared.  When the GM switched teams, he didn't switch passwords, which is really dumb when you move to a rival organization.  Some employee in the Cardinals front office thought as a lark to try and see if he could log-in, and could, and then stupidly posted private Astros info to the internet for shits-and-giggles only to launch an FBI investigation against him.  This employee is pretty screwed, as computer laws are ridiculously strict for using someone elses password in an unauthorized way.  Even if the information was given to the top of the front office and used in decisions; it seems like it would be really hard to gain a tangible advantage -- the Cardinals are going to trust their scouts and analysis more, and even if they find the Astros value someone they want less in the draft, they'd still have to worry about the other 30 teams grabbing the player so its hard to get an advantage from that either.  (Granted, yes it seems hard to believe 0.4 psi of pressure loss gives Brady a tangible advantage either)."
Patriots,3cpeui,djimbob,2,Thu Jul 9 20:56:46 2015 UTC,"Some employee in the Cardinals front office thought as a lark to try and see if he could log-in, and could, and then stupidly posted private Astros info to the internet for shits-and-giggles only to launch an FBI investigation against him.   Apparently that's not what happened.  That seems especially odd since you're talking about an IT guy who was brought in specifically to work on information systems like the one that was hacked into. It seems relatively unlikely that he practiced bad security—and later reports suggest that it was not merely ""Hey, maybe he used the same password. . . . Wow, he did!"""
Patriots,3cpeui,TNT_Banana,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:04:23 2015 UTC,"The June 17th NYTimes seems to sound like that (quoting law enforcement):   Investigators believe that Cardinals personnel, concerned that Mr. Luhnow had taken their idea and proprietary baseball information to the Astros, examined a master list of passwords used by Mr. Luhnow and the other officials when they worked for the Cardinals. The Cardinals employees are believed to have used those passwords to gain access to the Astros’ network, law enforcement officials said.   Yes, later articles from the Astros GM said he changed his password (though that doesn't mean there wasn't some other account; e.g., a backup account or IT admin account that wasn't changed) and doesn't mean that he didn't just change his password from BabeRuth3 to LouGehrig4 or similar.  Regardless, it is a horrible practice to have a master list of passwords or ever log a password.  Maybe it was a shitty contractor who gave themselves a backdoor from laziness, or had SQL injections or what not.  But the last official reporting I've seen on the matter (that isn't just some the Astros GM claiming to not be an idiot), was that it was reused passwords as the method to gain access.  (And similarly why are the systems publicly accessible versus behind a secure VPN or only accessed from the intranet of the front office?)"

I don't think the actions of the front office take away from the Cardinals players in any manner; and I still can't see how this could be used to any Cardinal advantage.  I'm also not sure how high up this went in the front office.  I can see some in the front office losing their jobs (because of the scandal) or having to go to jail (because of vague laws setup to protect insecure idiots), but I doubt it led to any Cardinal wins.

Literally the only way he's tackling him is by taking out his legs. He moves his head way to the side and leads with his shoulder, which would do next to no damage if he made clean contact with his legs.  Calling him an asshole for very, very clearly doing everything he could to avoid hitting his helmet against the knee is absurd. If anything we should praise him playing that as safely as possible and send it to TJ Ward. Didn't really launch (legs don't leave ground), moves to side, and tries to simply trip him up. That's the advantage of a Gronk sized player."

They missed the playoffs at 11-5, losing the division to a tiebreaker. That was a better record than 4 other playoff teams, and tied 3 others. This was all without Tom Brady. I would say no.  How about 2012? Nope, we got to the AFCCG for the second year in a row.  In 2002, BB was just getting started here in New England, Brady was developing, and the whole Patriot way of life wasn't really established. 10 years later, every player in the league knows what to expect when going to NE; no bullshit, do your job or your done. The group of guys we have now are as close knit of a team as I have seen in quite some time, I just can't see them half-assing it because they won a Super Bowl.  Anything could happen, obviously, but pointing to the one year out of 13 that TB and BB missed the the playoffs means nothing."
Patriots,3cscn2,godtogblandet,6,Fri Jul 10 13:04:38 2015 UTC,You still had a 9-7 record and tiebreaker gave the AFC east to the Jets. You did not suck. Tiebreaker kept you out of the playoffs.

Patriots,3cqwh3,-Deadzone-,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:14:55 2015 UTC,"NFL Coaches Association:       The National Football League Coaches Association (NFLCA) is a group of coaches in the National Football League (NFL). The only exception is Bill Belichick.   During the 2011 NFL Lockout, the NFLCA filed a brief in favor of the players.   Many coaching contracts allow the termination of the coach with little notice and without specific cause, usually in the case of high-profile coaches with the payment of a financial settlement. Coaching is a very fickle profession, and a reversal of the team's fortune often finds last year's ""Coach of the Year"" to be seeking employment in the next. Many coaches are former players of the sport themselves, and coaches of professional sports teams are sometimes retired players. The head coach usually delegates development of details such as techniques of play or placement of players on the playing surface, to offensive and defensive coordinators and/or assistants while concentrating on larger issues such as recruitment and organizational development.

Can you imagine trying to defend the Wells Report before an objective third party?  If he removes the suspension he still has to try and justify the punishment to the team (which logically is unjustifiable) so that's going to take some heavy spin work and leaning on the media.

Patriots,3cmgvi,Sixchr,27,Thu Jul 9 01:38:33 2015 UTC,Tom Brady in 2014/15 is not better than Aaron Rodgers in 2014/15.
Patriots,3cmgvi,SpecOpBeevee,24,Thu Jul 9 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"Tom Brady faced the best defenses in the NFL last year and consistently beat them Detroit, Buff, seattle, all of whom beat Rodgers last season.  Rodgers is a stats monster thanks to being a great QB and having excellent receivers and a great offensive line, but Brady on the Packers does better than Rodgers did last year."
Patriots,3cmgvi,Sixchr,-1,Thu Jul 9 01:50:26 2015 UTC,Brady on the Packers does better than Rodgers did last year.   The Packers came up short last year because their coaching is dreadful. Aaron Rodgers was the reason they nearly beat Seattle in the NFC Championship Game. Tom Brady would not have kept the Packers' coaching staff from imploding.
Patriots,3cmgvi,mattsparrow,16,Thu Jul 9 01:52:24 2015 UTC,"McCarthy is not a bad coach, and Rodgers deserves a fair share of blame for that game. Whether that makes someone feel that Brady or Rodgers is number 1 is a different story."
Patriots,3cmgvi,LeftShark2012,3,Thu Jul 9 01:59:37 2015 UTC,"Okay maybe McCarthy isn't a bad coach, but he made some pretty damn dreadful decisions in that game.  Sure Rodgers can take some blame for the game, but I was shocked there wasn't a full force fan rebellion against McCarthy after the game, and I think the only reason there wasn't was because the guy missed the onside kick and became the scapegoat."
Patriots,3cmgvi,buttsoupjets,5,Thu Jul 9 15:18:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, blame coaching when your defense gives you 4 interceptions and you get 22 points, 19 before you needed to drive for a field goal because the other team came back.   Rodgers sucked"
Patriots,3cmgvi,JozefT,5,Thu Jul 9 04:47:29 2015 UTC,"lol no, a team throws 4 ints against Brady he's not going to put up a measly 22 pts. Brady played better and the NFL top 100 is not only decided using the regular season."

Patriots,3cmgvi,TheMagicianDolph,4,Thu Jul 9 20:19:27 2015 UTC,I would not agree with this. Rodgers played objectively bad. The D gave him a lot of extra possessions but he wasn't able to put much together.
Patriots,3cmgvi,New__York__Bozo,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:01:52 2015 UTC,"Everyone in this thread seems to have forgotten that Rodgers was playing with a severe calf strain in that game that would have benched most QB's.

Patriots,3cmgvi,SpecOpBeevee,2,Thu Jul 9 16:53:35 2015 UTC,Why does everyone sell McCarthy short? He might be one of the few coaches in the NFL that BB actually respects.....
Patriots,3cmgvi,Sixchr,0,Thu Jul 9 01:55:27 2015 UTC,"Because I don't think he has very good control over his operation. He keeps his face buried in the playsheet and pays zero attention to the other side of the ball. Hell he didn't even know that Clay Matthews, his best defensive player, wasn't even on the field at the end of the NFC Championship Game.  He said he's giving up playcalling to his offensive coordinator so we'll see how he is next year. I just don't think he's a very good head coach."
Patriots,3cmgvi,SpecOpBeevee,0,Thu Jul 9 01:59:49 2015 UTC,"It will be interesting to see how Green Bay is next year with that change to play calling, and you could be proven correct."
Patriots,3cmgvi,JustinC00,-1,Thu Jul 9 02:04:55 2015 UTC,Whoa. Let's stop with the coaching was dreadful stuff. Rodgers had as much if not more to do with losing that game than the coaching staff.  If he is the best QB in the game he finds a way to score TDs instead of FGs starting 3 drives inside the Seattle 35.  Also he threw a terrible interception on the first drive in the end zone and a terrible interception late in the 2nd quarter on the Seattle side of the field.
Patriots,3cmgvi,ArDariusStewart13,5,Thu Jul 9 03:48:15 2015 UTC,"Rodgers is a better QB right now, but I'll say it again, if I can have one QB that I can trust the most to get me a win, I'm taking Brady."

You are a hypothetical coach heading into a Super Bowl (i.e. the most important of games) and you get to draft your quarterback.  Who do you take, Brady, Manning, or Rogers?  No-brainer for me, and I suspect for anyone with any intellectual honesty."
Patriots,3cmgvi,Sixchr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:07:37 2015 UTC,For sure. If you give me one QB for one game right now I'm taking Brady. But that's not what I'm talking about.

Patriots,3cmgvi,mcorcoran3,3,Thu Jul 9 09:00:38 2015 UTC,Those stats are close - also Rodgers can run. I don't think its worth complaining about Rodgers ranking slightly ahead of Brady. He was the MVP and almost doesn't know how to throw picks.
Patriots,3cmgvi,TB12isHnnnnng,-1,Thu Jul 9 14:26:27 2015 UTC,"Oh no, they were definitely close and I don't have too much of a problem with him being slightly ahead. But the r/NFL and like notion that Rodgers is far and away the best QB who ever set foot on the field has made me overly defensive."

That's an incredibly stupid and flawed argument to make. Not to mention Aaron Rodgers was not the reason that Green Bay lost to Seattle in the NFC Championship Game.
Patriots,3cmgvi,SpecOpBeevee,9,Thu Jul 9 01:49:19 2015 UTC,"NEvsGB was a great solid game, and it was very close, but I am very confident NE would have won if Hightower and Chandler weren't out that game, those are two of our best defensive players."
Patriots,3cmgvi,Sixchr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:54:05 2015 UTC,I'm not disagreeing with you. I think New England would have won if they had a rematch in the Super Bowl. My point is you can't use that line of logic. You can't say A beat B and C beat A so C would beat B. It's incredibly flawed and stupid.
Patriots,3cmgvi,SpecOpBeevee,3,Thu Jul 9 01:56:10 2015 UTC,"I'm using the logic that when faced with the best defenses in the NFL last year Tom Brady put up amazing numbers and preformed very well. He beat Detroit who had beaten Rodgers, he beat Buffalo which would go on to beat rodgers (actually made him look horrible), then he beat Seattle who beat Rodgers twice last year.... Not only did he beat the best Defense last year, but he did so extremely convincingly.   I dont think it is a stretch to say a solid Offensive Line, Running Back, and WR core plays a big role in how a QB does, saying that TB12 won the SB with a middle of the pack (If lucky) offensive line, a bunch of no ones at RB, and a single probowler in Gronk.  Rodgers no doubt had the better season stats wise, but last year if im picking a QB its TB12."

Patriots,3cofs9,patsfans,15,Thu Jul 9 14:16:24 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of ""disagree, rodgers better QB at this point in career, Brady better overall career"". While obviously Brady has the better career, and unless  Rodgers does something miraculous for the remainder of his career, it will remain that way, I think it's kind of two arguments here. I would certainly agree Rodgers is a better passer right now, and can do more physically, but is passer the same meaning as QB? That's where I get hung up. For me there is a difference. The point of a QB is to command the offense and put his team in position to win, and make plays when the team needs them most. Although Rodgers is great at all of the above, I still believe Brady is the best in the league in those categories. See Mannings record season. Would anyone claim he was the best ""passer"" or gifted  physical QB that year? No, but he was the best QB. Thats an example of how I differentiate. Sometimes I think we get a little too googly eyed at physical QB's and proclaim they're the best, and dismiss guys like Brady as being the best by saying ""system QB, not a great deep ball, cant run"". But the system is whatever Brady makes it, and he makes the best system for his team every game, whether he's playing the Ravens in the wild card game passing every single play to lead comebacks, or exposing Indy by recognizing when to run. So although I agree Rodgers is  a better passer and more gifted physically, I don't think he a better QB over Brady, even at this point. Just how I see it."
Patriots,3cofs9,T_Blitz,4,Thu Jul 9 15:09:06 2015 UTC,"is passer the same meaning as QB?   No, it isn't.  Right now, it's not inconceivable that from a pure passing standpoint, Garoppolo is a better passer than Brady. That doesn't make Garoppolo a better QB overall, though."
Patriots,3cofs9,ctpatsfan77,-4,Thu Jul 9 16:50:26 2015 UTC,"Rodgers in 2014: 38:5 TD/INT (#1 and it isn't even close), 8.43 yards/attempt (#2, only 3 players above 8.0), 9.45 ay/a (#1 by far), 8.65 any/a (#1 by far).  On top of being the best pure passer by far, he was 7th in yards rushing despite being 11th in rushing attempts, meaning when he chose to run he gained more yards than all but two QBs (Wilson, bortles)  Packers 2014:  /#1 in points despite being #32 in total drives  /#3 by .2 in yards per drive (#4 was a full 2 y/d behind)  /#1 in scoring %  /#1 in turnover percentage    Just because his defense gave up 15 points in 4 minutes he's looked down on? He had to drive down to tie the game and did it easily. This is how all other fans treated Brady 09-12...just cause the defense can't hold a lead doesn't mean the QB isn't the best in the league.  He put his team in the situation to win better than any QB. His defense failed him."

Patriots,3cofs9,ihateconnecticut,9,Thu Jul 9 14:27:06 2015 UTC,I agree on the way it was written.   But if rankings are subject to recency bias then shouldn't inability to audible in last minutes of latest NFC championship game be held against the QB?  And the ability to score 2 TD in last minutes against best defense in SB held in favor of QB?
Patriots,3cofs9,-Deadzone-,4,Thu Jul 9 15:52:13 2015 UTC,"Inability to audible? Huh? I highly doubt he wasn't given the option to audible considering he essentially calls all the plays. Anyone who says otherwise is lying to protect someone (Rodgers was the OC for Matt Flynns historic game..that was years ago)  Are you REALLY holding the NFCCG against Rodgers? His defense gave up 15 points in less than 3 minutes, and he still drove the ball down the field to force overtime in less than 70 seconds, on the ROAD, against the best defense in the league.  By that logic, Brady is at fault for 2007 (so what if he gave the lead, they lost), 2011 (same thing)?"
Patriots,3cofs9,ihateconnecticut,9,Thu Jul 9 16:09:50 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Rodgers went on record saying he doesn't call the plays and he doesn't think Peyton does either.

Patriots,3cofs9,RedditName12,4,Thu Jul 9 17:32:23 2015 UTC,"So you think he doesn't have audible power...the way the Pats offense works is McD gives Brady a main option, but it's based off of imperfect information. Brady when he sees the defense has more knowledge than McD did so he can either stay or change to a backup option.  That's overly simplified, there are options on options, but to think that any top QBS doesn't change the play all, blocking scheme, or anything before the snap is weird."
Patriots,3cofs9,ihateconnecticut,2,Thu Jul 9 19:00:29 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between play-calling and audibles...  Every QB in the league has atleast one audible (hell even Manziel probably has a run/pass audible to switch between the two), i'm also under the impression QBs generally don't call blocking schemes, pretty sure thats done by the center. But yeah, I never implied QBs don't change plays, just that they normally don't call their own plays from the huddle."

Patriots,3cofs9,-Deadzone-,2,Thu Jul 9 16:18:31 2015 UTC,"Deficiency? They were up by 12 points with 5 minutes to go when they got the ball. They ran it three times, causing the Seahawks to use 2 of their timeouts, and punting them deep when the Seahawks got the ball with 4 minutes left.  Their win probability in that situation was 99%. You don't even MENTION that when they got the ball back on their own 22 with around 1:30 left, he drove them 48 yards on the road against the best defense in the league to tie the game (3/5 for 36 yards and a 12 yard run) which were his only passing plays in the final 5 minutes  That's like saying Brady taking a knee in the divisional round against the Ravens was a deficiency...the Ravens actually had a better chance of winning with a Hail Mary (It's right around 2%) as it depends on a single play, rather than a lucky 2 point conversion, lucky onside kick, as well as two touchdowns."
Patriots,3cofs9,ihateconnecticut,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:26:52 2015 UTC,Rodgers defense gave him 4 interceptions and special teams gave him a fumble within field goal range. He scored 19 point lol that's pathetic.
Patriots,3cofs9,buttsoupjets,0,Thu Jul 9 23:55:16 2015 UTC,"The loss against Miami last year they had 3 takeaways and only scored 20. That happens a lot more than you think (in 2004 it happened 4 times to the Patriots alone), especially on the road in the loudest stadium in the league in he pouring rain against the best defense.  The 5 turnovers:  Seattle 19 - led to a field goal. McCarthy refused to run a 4th down play even though they were on the half yard line. 3 straight running plays within 7 yards.  Seattle 23 - again McCarthy refuses to go for a touchdown on 4th and a half yard on goal line.   Green Bay 44 - ended in Rodgers interception on miscommunication/hurried throw. Hard to tell if Cobb/Nelson didn't run right route or what. Blame it on Rodgers.  Green Bay 20 - near the end of half in pouring rain, tried a couple deep balls to get to field goal range in under a minute. False start kind of ruined the drive. ended with a punt to essentially end half.   Green Bay 43 - the drive where they ran Lacy 3 times, ran the clock out to 4 minutes while Seattle wasted two timeouts. They had a 99% chance of winning. This would be like calling Brady out for taking a knee against the Ravens if that Hail Mary scored.  So on one of the drives they were committed to wasting time, another to go deep for a quick TD before half, one was a bad INT, and two others led to points, though McCarthy left potentially 4-8 on the field.  3/5 for 36 yards (7.2 y/a) and 12 yards rushing on the final drive to go 48 yards in 60 seconds. But nah Rodgers definitely faltered in the 4th quarter cause they wisely tried to run the clock out on the rain.    I bet you praise Brady for that Saints game 2 years ago? The one with Thompkins? Yeah Brady had a 4 and out and a terrible interception the two drives before. But he's remembered because defense gave him a chance. Rodgers defense failed him."

Brady this time is the one who went on a big run and ended up the Superbowl MVP.   I have no problem with Rodgers being the number one ranked QB simply because he was the best QB this year.

Patriots,3cofs9,Fenstick,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:02:44 2015 UTC,"I can see why people put rodgers as number one, id put him at number 2. He has more physical attributes, more elusiveness, and can make throws on the run (though bradyf improved tremendously there). But all the apologists trying to write off his performance against Seattle while blaming one of the best coaches in the league for it is hilarious to me. Brady beat all the best defenses this year by playing his way. And he didnt just beat them, he trashed them. Detroit, Buffalo, Baltimore and Seattle got embarassed. Rodgers being ""injured"" is no excuse. The packers had plenty of time to game plan around that and design a plan that better attacked the Hawks. They didnt. He wasnt even that hobbled, and Sherman and Thomas got injured mid game, which is easier to take advantage of than 2 weeks post injury like the Pats did. Meanwhile Brady absolutely lit them up. Hell you dont even need to limit it to the seattle game, look how rodgers played against Buffalo.  Ill take a guy who can throw 50+ times, mostly in less than 2 seconds, and wins the super bowl over a guy who wows you most of the time but folds once he cant run out of the pocket. Same with the 49ers games the last 2 years before that. He didnt play bad, but I never really thought the 49ers would lose at any point in those games. When brady played the 49ers (without Gronk) he still looked like he could win even if he did end up losing. You could say Brady usually has Gronk, but Rodgers has one of the best backs in the league in Eddy Lacy, and an incredible 3 receiver group in Nelson, Cobb and Adams (Adams is a new addition though).  Anyway I love them both and Im a huge Rodgers fan, but he needs to polish some things before I give him the crown and yes, winning a super bowl against the team that beat him a week before does matter, even if its not the nail in the coffin of the argument. With that said, as long as they are one and two in some order its all good.  As for Luck over Brady lmao."

Patriots,3cofs9,ABearWithABeer,4,Thu Jul 9 17:22:47 2015 UTC,"I suggest you go watch the NFCC again. Packers defense forced 4 TO's and the ST forced another. 5 turnovers Rodgers was the beneficiary of. And on 3 of them he started inside the SEA 35 and came away with only 3 FGs.  He threw two horrendous INTs on SEA's side of the field (One in the EZ and another at the SEA 23)   13 Drives and the suppose ""best QB"" puts up 22 points.   If that was Brady people would go on and on about how he is done and can't do it in the playoffs. Rodgers does it and it's nothing but excuses"
Patriots,3cofs9,JustinC00,0,Thu Jul 9 17:42:47 2015 UTC,Not excuses. I'm just pointing out that you can't put too much emphasis on a team's success when you're looking at individual players. If Brady was in Rodger's situation any talk of him not being able to get it done in the playoffs would be more reflective of his age.   You can't discount Rodger's performance based off that one game which was in Seattle. Brady was undoubtedly the best QB in 2007 and he only put up 14 points in the Super Bowl. One bad game shouldn't discount a whole season.

Patriots,3cmg9d,LAMONSTER12,35,Thu Jul 9 01:25:44 2015 UTC,I agree with the ranking. I mean Rodgers was playing well and this is only for 2014. If you win the MVP you are most likely going to be above all other QBs. Brady however is the GOAT.
Patriots,3cmg9d,ThePonch,28,Thu Jul 9 01:33:24 2015 UTC,"Deserved, imo, behind just Watt and Rodgers. Demarco Murray at 4 is a joke though."
Patriots,3cmg9d,lmm310,26,Thu Jul 9 01:32:30 2015 UTC,manning #5 was a joke too
Patriots,3cmg9d,advillious,4,Thu Jul 9 07:13:31 2015 UTC,Manning was epic last year until he died. People have been shitting on him way too much after the fact.
Patriots,3cmg9d,sugar_free_haribo,30,Thu Jul 9 09:00:49 2015 UTC,This isn't a 2014 up until you get injured ranking list.
Patriots,3cmg9d,edster2003,-5,Thu Jul 9 11:14:51 2015 UTC,"Well considering the field reports from OTAs that he's now in great shape, that he has been the greatest QB ever over the past two regular seasons when healthy, and that he's gotten a bye each of his 3 seasons in Denver, I don't think it's a stretch to rank him at #5. His performance last year prior to the injury is absolutely relevant to projecting for 2015."

Patriots,3cmg9d,PantsB,3,Thu Jul 9 14:01:28 2015 UTC,Wasn't too impressed with the video. To many patriots or ex patriots interviews. Actually kind of a disappointment considering the guy just tied Montana and did it with a rag tag group of receivers.

Patriots,3cmg9d,Sixchr,3,Thu Jul 9 02:08:18 2015 UTC,"I don't expect everyone to agree with me. I just feel that Gronkowski is a better and more impactful football player than everyone except JJ Watt. As important as QBs are, Gronkowski is just on a complete other level. Jimmy Garoppolo will look like a top 10 QB because of Rob Gronkowski."
Patriots,3cmg9d,ILikePinecones,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:14:04 2015 UTC,"In terms of impact on a game, the best TE will not have the same impact as the best QB's.  Gronkowski is the best TE in the league, but that doesn't make him a top 5 player IMO.  I was surprised he even got top 10 considering how low other TE's were rated."

Patriots,3cmg9d,Sixchr,21,Thu Jul 9 01:31:13 2015 UTC,"Come on, stop it. Rodgers is in his prime and Brady is on the back end. We're not talking resumes. Aaron Rodgers is the best QB in the league."
Patriots,3cmg9d,brizalmighty,2,Thu Jul 9 01:38:35 2015 UTC,"nope. brady is still as good as ever, you could even argue hes better by improving his scrambling. rodgers is soft and will never be as good as brady no matter how pretty a ball he throws."
Patriots,3cmg9d,Sixchr,6,Thu Jul 9 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"you could even argue hes better by improving his scrambling.   For sure. He managed to improve his game last year, absolutely. That's why he maintained his positioning and wasn't surpassed by someone else. He's still #2 to Aaron Rodgers."
Patriots,3cmg9d,sugar_free_haribo,3,Thu Jul 9 01:43:17 2015 UTC,I think Brady's #1 because he can actually stay on the field and be relatively healthy. Rodgers is better but seems to get derailed by injuries every year.
Patriots,3cmg9d,brizalmighty,-5,Thu Jul 9 09:02:41 2015 UTC,well last year brady was 3 and rodgers was 11. what criteria are you judging players on? how pretty they throw a football? how good their stats are? brady can put up rediculous stats if he wants too its not about stats. its about winning. brady won the sb last year and shreaded the best defense in ten years. hes better than rodgers without question.
Patriots,3cmg9d,Sixchr,12,Thu Jul 9 01:53:50 2015 UTC,hes better than rodgers without question.   Take the homer glasses off.
Patriots,3cmg9d,brizalmighty,-7,Thu Jul 9 01:57:01 2015 UTC,lool ok rodgers is better than brady cuz he throws a prettier football.
Patriots,3cmg9d,ParsInterarticularis,8,Thu Jul 9 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"Those were some pretty balls in the NFCCG.  I am so sick of people forgetting that humans play football, and leadership is the most overlooked quality in the game.  Now move on to clutch and Rodgers can't even smell Brady's piss.  Brady is the better football player.  Down 10 instead of up 16, Brady wins.  Rodgers scored 6 points in the 2nd half of the NFCCG."
Patriots,3cmg9d,Princenarwhal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:03:09 2015 UTC,Couldn't have said it better myself.
Patriots,3cmg9d,Iwaspromisedcake1,3,Thu Jul 9 05:32:51 2015 UTC,Rodgers is more accurate and has better arm strength
Patriots,3cmg9d,Stfuppercut,2,Thu Jul 9 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"And none of that helped him lead his offense to a win over Seattle after being gifted 5 turnovers.  Brady, on the other hand, was able to lead his offense out of a 10 point hole (2 games after overcoming TWO 14-point deficits) against Seattle to win the Super Bowl.  Arm strength and accuracy are great, but leadership is equally important. I admit that I only watch 6-8 Packers games a year,  but I have not seen Rodgers get fired up and motivated the way Brady can, which (in my opinion) is a large part of why Rodgers is something like 5-24 when entering the 4th quarter trailing by 1-8. Listen to Jones and McCourty during the Super Bowl, even the defense feeds of Brady and his drive to win.   You can't replace leadership with arm strength and accuracy."

Patriots,3cmg9d,ekjohnson9,-2,Thu Jul 9 23:09:50 2015 UTC,Uh. Brady is the best QB in the league.  Rodgers is good but you can't be the champ and a perennial one and done baby.
Patriots,3cmg9d,EMateos,2,Thu Jul 9 12:50:52 2015 UTC,Well Rodgers was the MVP...
Patriots,3cmg9d,SpecOpBeevee,3,Thu Jul 9 01:35:05 2015 UTC,"Watt should have been the MVP in the first place, but since their is a big misconception about how an MVP has to get his team to the playoffs we might as well say they have to win the playoffs and Superbowl"
Patriots,3cmg9d,EMateos,4,Thu Jul 9 01:57:44 2015 UTC,"A great DE is never going to be more valuable than a great QB in this league, football runs around the QBs. Trade Watt with Rodgers and Houston would be a Superbowl contender, and Green Bay a wild card one."
Patriots,3cmg9d,SpecOpBeevee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:07:56 2015 UTC,"I view it as most valuable player to that team, and I think there are a lot of QBs that could play with Green Bay effectively but JJ Watt is so far and away better than any other DE and makes the texans competitive."
Patriots,3cmg9d,EMateos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:10:57 2015 UTC,Not competitive enough. Rodgers could make almost any team competitive. Both are as valuable for their team.
Patriots,3cmg9d,ekjohnson9,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:16:41 2015 UTC,"He's a DE.  Shouldn't be anywhere near the MVP discussion.  He didn't single handedly carry his team like AP did a few years ago, or like Brady did during the post season."

Patriots,3cma58,LukyNumbrKevin,6,Thu Jul 9 13:09:00 2015 UTC,"If you delve further into the link, there are some more crazy details:   ""The play happens, and they pick the ball off. And I take three steps,"" Wilson said (via NESN.com). ""And on the third step God says to me, 'I'm using you ... I want to see how you respond. But most importantly, I want them to see how you respond.'""  Of course, Malcolm Butler -- the interceptor -- would probably have a different explanation for the interception. While Wilson credited God for ""using"" him, Butler credited film study and practice, saying that he knew the play was coming before the ball was even snapped.   Wilson has been saying he hears god talking to him an awful lot lately, I'm starting to wonder if he has schizophrenia and is hearing actual voices talking to him frequently? I think in the past schizophrenics were sometimes deemed to be talking to gods/the dead, but then we learned about mental disorders and random voices popping into your head constantly is a sign of a mental disorder.  I'm not coming down on religion entirely here either. While I'm not religious, I don't think if there is a god he'd just drop down and talk with football players about football all day (more important things out there). Not to mention, according to bible stories, seeing or hearing god directly would probably dramatically change/age/kill him, akin to the bible story that Moses' face glowed so bright after talking to god no one could look at him."

Patriots,3clnhw,calebhall,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:55:35 2015 UTC,Props to the D for getting the ball back to the offence so many times during crunch time. Gave Brady multiple chances. They were the reason they started 5-1 that season.
Patriots,3clnhw,TheMagicianDolph,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:33:25 2015 UTC,True that. Our D was insane that year until we had like 77265 starters down then our offence went mad until Gronk got hurt again.
Patriots,3cox1c,Fishing_for_Boulders,4,Thu Jul 9 16:26:11 2015 UTC,"Let's say that no scalpers exist, and no one who wants to go decides to resell their tickets for some reason (the far more common source of secondary tickets). Once you try, and fail, to get tickets via the general sale because they already sold out to other fans, how do you go at all now? Is it better to have no access to the tickets at all?  The hate that is constantly spewed towards resellers is so misplaced. You aren't competing ""people who have no plans to actually go to the game, but rather make a quick buck off selling tickets bc their connection and click skills are slightly better than min"", you're competing against other people that are want to go to the game too (and are maybe willing to pay more than you to do so). If that second group doesn't exist, the scalpers are going to be reselling to you cheaper than face value."
Patriots,3cox1c,okthrowaway2088,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"That's very true and I get it. I understand that the market exists bc prices are competitive. And I do realize that there are those with more money to spend who want it more. Again I'm just frustrated not bc I fear that the prices won't exceed their value on the market, but they will exceed a cost people like me can pay.   I'm looking at this selfishly, which makes my view point slightly skewed, and my fear is that I'm going to have to break the bank just for the experience.   Hopefully I can get a ticket at the start, but if not then I'll have to make the hard decision to pay what may becomes 300% face value for a ticket I wasn't quick enough to get."
Patriots,3cox1c,PatricksPub,0,Thu Jul 9 16:52:36 2015 UTC,"Without scalpers, that market is running at far less than optimal efficiency. Eventually,  the overall price for tickets would settle somewhere near the average resale price since that is what people are willing to pay. Also, the most important part that he stated is that there would no chance at all for going to the game without the resale of tickets."

You can see the Bengals MLB #57 freeze up for a split second thinking Brady is going to Wright, thus he can't drift in front of Gronk. Brady doesn't even need to use a pump fake, he simply uses the linebackers instincts (as his semi-flat footedness makes it seem that he is about to drive a throw to the outside) against him.  Brady used this same technique against Bobby Wagner in the Super Bowl but Wagner's superior quickness enabled him to cut back under Gronk and pick Brady off."

TB gave the order to reduce air pressure below legal limits and  b. the employees who reduced air pressure below legal limits acted under coercion from the organization     Secondly, if TB's wages are garnished for non cooperation as he did not provide his cell phone conversation between himself and Jastremski + McNally then labor / civil court in this situation will favor the arguments that   a. TB did not provide his cellphone as he was an unionized member obligated to follow instructions of NFLPA  b. Since NFL already had phone texts of Jastremski + McNally  and hence TB's cellphone texts were not necessary  There is no way TB loses this in labor / civil court. Kessler will shred NFL in courts on these points. If Kessler goes for discovery motion and subpoenas NFL + Wells communications then TB goes nuclear and sues for $$,000,000 defamation."

Patriots,3cljt5,ctpatsfan77,5,Wed Jul 8 21:37:25 2015 UTC,"Regarding defamation lawsuit, as I mentioned in my above post, it all depends what comes out after discovery process of NFL + Wells communications.

Patriots,3cljt5,makethemsayayy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:50:04 2015 UTC,"Not quite.

Patriots,3cljt5,NashBiker,4,Wed Jul 8 23:20:51 2015 UTC,"There were numerous leaks, of completely false information, that were not corrected until WEEKS later.  If they can show that they knew earlier but failed to correct the information being leaked, it could be a good sign for Brady.

Patriots,3cljt5,NashBiker,3,Thu Jul 9 14:57:39 2015 UTC,"Lawyer here. There are many different types of damages. You need to prove actual damages (earning potential, lost wages, property loss) in defamation cases. However, the court can find what are commonly called ""assumed"" or ""presumed"" damages based on damages that necessarily result from a statement or publication. The thing is, the circumstances in which this would actually factor in are almost completely dependent upon the the facts of the case at hand. Also, unlike actual damages which can be shown in an economic sense (ex. past wages and future expected earnings being higher than earnings post-defamation), assumed damages are harder to show, and are usually for a smaller, nominal amount.  Most folks are correct when they say the crux of this case (if it ends up going to court) lies in unionized labor arguments and contract law. At the end of the day, I think we'll all be happier if the suspension is gone and the first rounder is back, as opposed to Tom pocketing money (but that would be nice too).   Oh, and fuck the Jets."

During the Ray Rice investigation (you remember, the farce where the NFL investigated and then cleared itself), nobody had to turn in anything besides ""League devices"".

To demand personal texts of a unionized employee without a subpoena and then blatantly factor the refusal to turn it over into the punishment that will result in garnished wages is something else Kessler could go after."

Patriots,3ckh5b,doodeecheng5,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:06:57 2015 UTC,"The name of this stat can be misleading if you don't read the article. It really is a pretty useless stat. For example, you can't say ""if you increase your financial efficiency, you will win more games"" because winning a lot of games is used to calculate the financial efficiency.  The better way to show the Pats' spending skills, which I think is more useful, is looking expected wins per dollar for each player on the team. There was an article a few weeks back showing that the Pats, since the onset of free agency, had improved their team the most. This was before the draft."
Patriots,3ckh5b,Dharmasabitch,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:52:22 2015 UTC,"I thought NFL regulations prevented much variation between what teams are able to spend? To me this just says the Pats are the most successful professional sports team in the US since 2000. Which, correct me if I'm wrong, seems fairly indisputable."
Patriots,3ckh5b,bjb406,0,Sat Jul 11 09:02:13 2015 UTC,"Doesn't everyone's payroll come out exactly the same over the long haul? I mean there is a salary cap, and whatever a team doesnt pay gets rolled over, so they use it eventually. So this year the Dolphins are paying a ton but over the long haul its exactly equal for everyone. So this just becomes a question of who wins the most."
Patriots,3ckyqa,Rilese,7,Wed Jul 8 18:47:34 2015 UTC,"That put the Seahawks in the redzone, and made it look as if Marshawn “Beast Mode” Lynch was going to take over the game as he smashed his was up to the 2 yard line in two runs. On third down the impossible would occur… Pete Carrol saw the Goal Line defense look by the Patriots and decided to call a pick passing play for the win. Malcom Butler who had seen this play many times in practice leading up to the Super Bowl absolutely robbed the Seahawks with an amazing interception and shock the world.    So many mistakes.  Go check the play-by-play.   The Kearse catch gave the Seahawks, first and goal from the five yard line.  Took a timeout with 1:06. Lynch ran for 4 yards in one run. On second down at the one yard line, clock running, start the play with :26. Pete Carroll (not Carrol) calls a pass play.  He does this for numerous reasons including clock management (you can't call four goal line rushing plays with only one timeout left), and the fact that passing against a rush defense is often the better option. Malcolm Butler (not Malcom Butler; that's how Malcom Brown spells his first name) gets an interception. Malcolm Butler had seen this play once in scout-team practice running up to it where he got burned on it:    During a scout-team practice, backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo beat Butler on the same play for a touchdown to Josh Boyce.  ""We did and Josh got a touchdown in practice on it,"" Garoppolo confirmed in the Pats locker room. ""It got him ready and he knew what to expect. Jumping the route like that, that's very impressive. That's all instincts."""

Patriots,3cfl72,itsNOSAJ,34,Tue Jul 7 15:07:42 2015 UTC,I would rename this monster block by Dan Connolly.
Patriots,3cfl72,DontPanicMickey,11,Tue Jul 7 15:23:47 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, Connolly played that well. But I think this was more the defense failing here. They had two defenders for one blocker, but 59 just sort of drifts to his left, letting get blocked into the other defender and giving Vereen a huge alley there."
Patriots,3cfl72,mostlyforlurking,8,Tue Jul 7 15:30:12 2015 UTC,It was the nice fake from Vereen that kept both defenders out of position. Just a well executed play against an unprepared defense.
Patriots,3cfl72,the_word_is,2,Tue Jul 7 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah now that I think about it, it's a lot to ask for 59 to account for where the other defenders are. Still, if he had just held his position they would've covered the gap either side of Vereen, and even if Connolly blocks one there wouldn't be much space for Vereen to accelerate into. But definitely good work by the offense."
Patriots,3cfl72,mostlyforlurking,2,Tue Jul 7 16:39:32 2015 UTC,"No, you aren't wrong. 59 blew his assignment for sure. When you see a pulling guard you have to get across his body to the inside shoulder. If he does that, Connolly can't kick him out. At the very least he would plug the hole and leave the other defender unblocked. Basic stuff, really. The difference is in the NFL it happens so quick and a guy like Vereen can cause that hesitation that creates the misstep."
Patriots,3cfl72,the_word_is,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"Ehh not entirely true when talking about spilling a block all the time, but definitely correct for this instance. In this he is supposed to spill the block because he has the help on the outside. You can also box it back in to help. Depends on the defense being run. He also makes a fucking awful read and could have shot the gap and made a play. That's likely because it is 3rd and 16 and wasn't expecting a run. So he didn't get the correct read, which is understandable and then tried to overcompensate without knowing his run assignment. If 59 just stays inside, this play doesn't break for a first down."
Patriots,3cfl72,Hobodethbuny,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:41:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know what I like better: that block, or Vereen drawing 59 to his right so Connolly can block both of them."

Patriots,3cfl72,dmacisabeast,26,Tue Jul 7 15:16:48 2015 UTC,The whole thing is that everyone misunderstands the purpose of the draw on 3rd and long. It's a low risk play that allows the team to get better field position for their defense in the upcoming punt. 3rd and 16 is incredibly hard to convert on under any circumstances and there's a lot of risk in passing it when the defense is in a safe pass coverage defense.
Patriots,3cfl72,MrFace1,15,Tue Jul 7 18:06:56 2015 UTC,Draw on 3rd and long makes perfect sense.  It's the draws on 2nd and long that drive me fucking nuts.

Patriots,3cfl72,-Rattata-,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:21:46 2015 UTC,"The reason this play has upvotes, is because a 3rd and long draw play doesn't convert a lot. Great run blocking and good patience and vision lead it to converting. I don't think it's absurd to criticize that type of play calling."

Patriots,3cfl72,The_Hokage,9,Tue Jul 7 20:06:11 2015 UTC,I remember watching this live and being happily surprised this play worked for once.
Patriots,3cfl72,quinsy42,7,Tue Jul 7 15:54:32 2015 UTC,I can't believe he is gone. He was HUGE in the SB and an all around great player
Patriots,3cfl72,hang3xc,5,Tue Jul 7 16:32:48 2015 UTC,"Injured a bit prior to 2014 might have a role in the decision to let him go.  But then, I think Woodhead was a better player and Bill let him walk too."
Patriots,3cfl72,DinkandDrunk,3,Wed Jul 8 02:59:32 2015 UTC,"Lovely run by Vereen, leads the tackler outside so he gets eaten up by  Connolly and then drives the gap."
Patriots,3cfl72,semt3x,3,Tue Jul 7 17:55:12 2015 UTC,I love it. As soon as he catches a glimpse of daylight he's gone.
Patriots,3cfl72,SplintPunchbeef,3,Tue Jul 7 15:25:30 2015 UTC,Dat Patience...
Patriots,3cfl72,pooroldben,2,Tue Jul 7 21:13:46 2015 UTC,"Damn, Connolly effectively blocked two Bengals on that play. Can someone explain why the Pats haven't re-signed him?"
Patriots,3cfl72,madonnaboomboom,2,Tue Jul 7 22:19:05 2015 UTC,Mike Reiss reported he looked to have slimmed down at the ring ceremony and is likely retiring. He's had some concussion issues.
Patriots,3cfl72,2big_2fail,2,Tue Jul 7 22:25:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Just looked up his stats. I didn't realize he'd already been in the league for almost 10yrs. Sounds about right. May as well go out on a high note and protect his health."
Patriots,3cfl72,madonnaboomboom,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:47:51 2015 UTC,I hope he retires

Patriots,3cfl72,Plutor,3,Wed Jul 8 01:29:20 2015 UTC,We ran it too many times in the SB though. Went 3 and out twice because of 3 straight runs had me screaming.
Patriots,3cfl72,makethemsayayy,6,Tue Jul 7 16:37:03 2015 UTC,"We had 3 three-and-outs in the Super Bowl:   Started at 8:05 left in the 2nd. Incomplete, pass, incomplete. 4:48 left in the 3rd. Pass called back for holding, incomplete, pass, incomplete. 0:55 left in the 3rd. Rush, pass, rush for a loss.   In fact I only see one time we rushed 3 times in a row: In the middle of the long drive at the end of the 1st that ended in the endzone pick, and they were all positive plays and included a conversion on 3rd-and-1.  Are you thinking of a different game?"
Patriots,3cfl72,lunaticfringed,0,Tue Jul 7 18:55:03 2015 UTC,oh well a third down run that got stuffed with Blount pissed me off. Where he went outside and lost yards on 3rd and 1.  Shit pissed me off.
Patriots,3cfl72,coopr1248,3,Wed Jul 8 05:00:21 2015 UTC,It's the worst play in the book. It's essentially throwing up a white flag and only works a micro-percentage of the time...
Patriots,3cfl72,2big_2fail,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:17:08 2015 UTC,That outside stutter before the jump-cut back inside by Vereen to get #59 to vacate the crease (and get mauled by Connolly) is a thing of beauty

Patriots,3cfl72,lunaticfringed,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:54:39 2015 UTC,There should be a highlight reel showing the other 99% of times this has failed. By far my least favorite play they run.
Patriots,3cfl72,DinkandDrunk,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:15:46 2015 UTC,They ran the same play twice on this drive and both got 10+ yards. I'll upload it this week.
Patriots,3cfl72,lunaticfringed,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:43:25 2015 UTC,"Haha...I'm not denying it, sometimes in given situations it works, it's just far more often than not, it doesn't. It'll be interesting to see if it remains this season without Vereen. That play originally came into the book when Woodhead was on the roster in 2010 if I remember."
Patriots,3cksjb,SuperEdel,3,Wed Jul 8 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"Well its nice to see that Brady is back at the ""height of [his] power"" again. Rather different than the tone from week 5 last year."

Patriots,3cfy15,itsNOSAJ,48,Tue Jul 7 16:39:31 2015 UTC,Man I'm gonna miss this guy. I don't care what anyone says. Could have been great here if he got consistent touches like in 2012.
Patriots,3cfy15,TheMagicianDolph,16,Tue Jul 7 16:46:17 2015 UTC,I was a very vocal fan of Ridley's while he was with us... very sad that he didn't sign with us again... even more sad that he's with the Jets now...
Patriots,3cfy15,enbentz,8,Tue Jul 7 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"Ridley was one of my favorites and it really looked like he had worked hard on how he carried the ball going into last season, he holds the ball much more securely."
Patriots,3cfy15,MrFace1,4,Tue Jul 7 18:31:08 2015 UTC,"I think his loss hurts more than vereen because he was the best back on the team by a good, but since he was hurt all year, and since he was probably gonna ride the bench anyway, im not really sweating it."
Patriots,3cfy15,bjb406,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:53:50 2015 UTC,His loss definitely hurts less than Shane.  He didn't contribute enough the past few years.  Whether he was benched or hurt.  The team basically operated fine without him.
Patriots,3cfy15,DinkandDrunk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:52:22 2015 UTC,I'm really really gonna miss him. He was definitely one of my favorites. I hope we get him back eventually.
Patriots,3cfy15,Tiger21SoN,15,Tue Jul 7 19:28:10 2015 UTC,Lol 24 didn't even touch him. Awesome block by Dobson too - Probably bought Ridley another 15-20 yards

Patriots,3cfy15,Mom-spaghetti,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:49:15 2015 UTC,Just curious if anyone remembers the last long run the pats broke for a TD. Seems like its been a while.
Patriots,3cfy15,headleygrange,6,Tue Jul 7 19:31:15 2015 UTC,"That was the biggest issue I had with Ridley. He didn't have the high end speed to really break away from defenders, so he almost always ended up getting caught from behind. The last long TD run would probably be one of Blount's."
Patriots,3cfy15,Suddenly_Something,3,Tue Jul 7 21:00:13 2015 UTC,Blount vs Colts in playoff game 2 years ago. Blount vs Falcons in same season.

Patriots,3cfmbe,crazyfoxxy,-2,Wed Jul 8 04:17:20 2015 UTC,"Collinsworth says:  ""This is pure, unadulterated class on the part of the Patriots""  First of all:  Hypocrisy.  This is NOT what he thinks about the Patriots organization, even remotely, he is a classic Patriots hater.  Secondly, making a grandiose statement like this is designed to bring attention to himself, taking it away from the special moment.  This would be like listening live to Dr. King's ""I have a Dream Speech"" and then commenting: ""I'm my most humble opinion, this is one of the most important speeches ever made in the glorious history of humanity.""  His observations are self-obvious, his comments glib and self-aggrandizing.  I really don't care what his superficial and insincere opinions are and wish he would keep them too himself."
Patriots,3cfmbe,crazyfoxxy,-15,Tue Jul 7 16:19:27 2015 UTC,Collinsworth nearly spoiled it at the end with his condescending monologue. Leave it to that guy to turn the spotlight back on himself at a moment like this.

Patriots,3cd5tw,mickguinness,54,Tue Jul 7 00:38:50 2015 UTC,Pretty sure most Giants fans agree with you too.
Patriots,3cd5tw,kjg1228,23,Tue Jul 7 02:04:37 2015 UTC,"Ronde belongs in the hall of fame.  I've forgotten some of the stats, but he stands alone in NFL history in a few categories: 40/20 club (actually nearly the only 50/30 member, sitting at 47/28), of which there are only 4 members IIRC.   I think he's 2nd all time in non-offensive (non kicker, non offense) points (15 TD, one safety). Oh, I just checked. He's 2 points behind Rod Woodson and 14 behind Deion Sanders. If you remove returns, he's 2nd all time.  2nd all time. 47 int/28 td. Did I mention he's 3rd all time in tackles for a defensive back?  Anyone saying he shouldn't be a lock for the hall is a poor fan of the sport.  Some other crazy stuff."
Patriots,3cd5tw,EONS,6,Tue Jul 7 08:20:37 2015 UTC,"If you remove returns, he's 2nd all time.   What is this, ESPN Stats and info?? ;)  But seriously--I totally agree with you.

Patriots,3cd5tw,Patriots_,131,Wed Jul 8 18:43:36 2015 UTC,I like comments such as this but there's still one problem with them: the statement is made with the presumption that the balls were actually deflated.

Patriots,3cd5tw,Mel_Gibsons_Sanity,14,Tue Jul 7 16:49:12 2015 UTC,"Read the article, he makes no such assumption. Even says the pats haven't been proven guilty."
Patriots,3cd5tw,Bigbohn,18,Tue Jul 7 10:47:46 2015 UTC,"Is there more to the quote -- because that is not really true. He says other teams manipulate footballs but he said nothing specifically about whether or not the Colts game had such shananigns. It is not an unreasonable inference, but an inference nonetheless."
Patriots,3cd5tw,mcorcoran3,-40,Tue Jul 7 02:13:16 2015 UTC,"The text messages are impossible to ignore. McNally was deflating balls.  The problem for the league is that they could not find physical evidence of deflation at the AFCCG. If McNally deflated that day, he took out an undetectable amount of air due to error, incompetence, or for some misguided placebo effect. The texts never should have been seized in the first place.  But even if they were, instead of cooking up bullshit scientific results, Wells should have interviewed the Colts' equipment manager about how he knew the ""well known secret"" that we deflate balls (mentioned in his pre-game email to the league) and followed that thread as well as tried to locate stadium footage of McNally from earlier games. This approach may or may not have nailed us but it would have been much more reasonable."
Patriots,3cd5tw,sugar_free_haribo,-25,Tue Jul 7 05:16:53 2015 UTC,"Well the texts go back all the way to May 2014 and proceed through the season, but I'm not saying that they constitute actionable evidence against the Pats to the necessary preponderance standard. Just it's obvious that McNally was deflating balls. And he clearly wasn't doing it before inspection, because otherwise he would have told investigators that."
Patriots,3cd5tw,sugar_free_haribo,23,Tue Jul 7 07:04:58 2015 UTC,"You're just wrong. It's not ""obvious"" at all. At all."
Patriots,3cd5tw,hubris105,-11,Tue Jul 7 07:16:01 2015 UTC,There's really no other credible explanation for the texts. At least none has been offered yet.
Patriots,3cd5tw,sugar_free_haribo,6,Tue Jul 7 08:45:59 2015 UTC,"Even if you are right on this, that means the text messages are the only possible piece of ""evidence"" there is. Not enough to suspend Brady."
Patriots,3cd5tw,Manning119,-1,Tue Jul 7 15:03:47 2015 UTC,"And where did I say Brady should be suspended, or the team sanctioned at all?"
Patriots,3cd5tw,sugar_free_haribo,7,Tue Jul 7 15:09:46 2015 UTC,"If McNally was deflating balls, then why did Brady have to play with 16 PSI balls in Week 7 against the Jets?  If McNally was supposed to be deflating balls, then why did Jastremski say that the balls were supposed to be at 13 PSI?  McNally's ""deflator"" texts and others are open to interpretation, but you cannot infer that he was doing something illegal when much more direct evidence in two separate instances (Week 7 and the AFCCG measurements) indicates that there was no ball deflation, no desire to deflate balls, and no desire to play with underinflated balls."
Patriots,3cd5tw,QuagMeyer6791,-10,Tue Jul 7 15:17:27 2015 UTC,Because he didn't deflate that particular day maybe? It's not that hard to reconcile.
Patriots,3cd5tw,sugar_free_haribo,9,Tue Jul 7 14:24:14 2015 UTC,so whenever mcnally felt like it he would pop in and deflate some balls...and other games he just sipped on a soda and said mehhhh ill get to it next week? hmmm ok
Patriots,3cd5tw,RodgersOverrated,-6,Tue Jul 7 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"No, the most straightforward explanation would be that sometimes the coast wasn't clear.  Head ref might have kept the game balls by his side inside the officials' shower room until just before kickoff or may have been walking right next to McNally as he carried the balls to the field."
Patriots,3cd5tw,sugar_free_haribo,9,Tue Jul 7 15:19:35 2015 UTC,How does one reconcile the fact that Tom told them to bring the rules to the refs so the balls were in fact within the legal limits as a result of that game?  Would that follow suit with someone who's trying to circumvent those very rules?
Patriots,3cd5tw,jb_19,-4,Tue Jul 7 15:22:49 2015 UTC,"There's no record of that conversation, but I think it probably did occur. Maybe Brady told them to present balls at 12.5 and only deflate if the refs added more air during inspection (as they did for 2 balls before the AFCCG), but to try to avoid having to do it at all by first reminding the refs of the 12.5 limit."
Patriots,3cd5tw,sugar_free_haribo,7,Tue Jul 7 15:47:45 2015 UTC,"If the text messages are sufficient for the deflator comment then you must also accept that he did in fact request that, as was pointed out in the Wells report, that they take a copy of the rules to the refs.  All you are doing is filling in blanks, if they exist or not, that with stuff that fits your narrative while ignoring other information which doesn't.  You suspect they are guilty despite a complete lack of any corroborating evidence and are just finding 'evidence' that supports that.  Like it or not the only evidence there is suggests that maybe a low level employee deflated some balls, no indication if it was legal or not, and that the refs were completely incompetent in this area.  There is no evidence beyond this.  The issue here is that you are expecting TFB to be able to prove that he didn't do anything wrong.  Unfortunately you can't absolutely prove a negative (the same reason religions still exist) There is a reason that the burden of proof falls on the accusers.  You are accepting the accusation as a likelihood that something happened without giving equal weight to the defense that nothing happened."
Patriots,3cd5tw,jb_19,-2,Tue Jul 7 16:04:00 2015 UTC,"Dude I just said I believe Brady about the copy of the rules. Only pointed out that Brady merely told Wells he gave those instructions - there's no documentation of the claim. Not sure what ""blanks"" I'm filling in."
Patriots,3cd5tw,sugar_free_haribo,6,Tue Jul 7 17:03:22 2015 UTC,So we're they under investigation for the afc game or were they just digging until they found something to their satisfaction.  Vague text messages from months ago have no relation to the initial allegations.
Patriots,3cd5tw,_Orly,0,Tue Jul 7 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"First of all, the texts are highly germane, even if they are not sufficient to show wrongdoing.  But after Wells obtained footage of McNally taking balls into a bathroom, I think it was fair for him to request access to communications with McNally from team phones matching certain search parameters. Once Wells recovered the texts with Jastresmski, it was reasonable for him to broaden the scope of the investigation to whether Pats had been tampering in other games as well. Doesn't really matter that the ""initial allegations"" only concerned the AFCCG.  In the end, he didn't expand the investigation, and probably wouldn't have found anything concrete had he done so."
Patriots,3cd5tw,sugar_free_haribo,49,Tue Jul 7 11:58:28 2015 UTC,"Every time I read an article that mentions deflategate, such as this one, and I'm reminded that WE LOST A FUCKING 1ST ROUND PICK FOR THIS PETTY UNPROVEN BULLSHIT - I get furious. I keep forgetting about it. It's such a disgusting travesty."
Patriots,3cd5tw,jrdnism,8,Tue Jul 7 15:56:10 2015 UTC,"Seriously, Is there another team where losing your QB for 4 games is treated as a vastly bigger deal than losing your 1st round pick?"
Patriots,3cd5tw,E1ger,5,Tue Jul 7 02:44:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's about Brady's legacy.  BB will still win 95% as many games without a 1st round pick, but if Brady is suspended even one game, some fans will never ever let us forget it."
Patriots,3cd5tw,Asshole_Salad,5,Tue Jul 7 12:36:53 2015 UTC,"That's it, basically. If Brady serves the suspension, I think it will make him the only QB in NFL history ever ""suspended for cheating"". The Pats would go down in NFL history as the only team ever with a QB ""suspended for cheating"".   So, it's about the legacy of who I feel is the greatest player in the NFL's history being tainted and marred. That's why I hope Brady doesn't roll over and take the suspension. I'm hoping he fights it with everything he's got, for the sake of his legacy, for the sake of his children, his family, his fans, and himself. It really is about the principle of it."
Patriots,3cd5tw,-Yvonne-,6,Tue Jul 7 19:03:54 2015 UTC,"This was never about the footballs. This was about several owners and head coaches in big demographic market teams or formerly big demographic market teams (Indy, Baltimore, Denver, New York (Jets, not Giants), Miami, Oakland, etc) that have not been able to replicate the success the Patriots have had. They've been complaining to the league for years. Even if you include 2002 and 2008, we've had more sustained success than most teams in the league over the last 15 years. Other teams have flopped a few times since then, but we've been consistently good.   Also, the league is making money off of new faces like Seattle doing as well as they've been doing. Changing the old guard to players like RGIII, Russell Wilson, Andrew Luck and Colin Kaepernick make the teams and league money by bringing in new fans.  Goodell has sucked for the majority of his career and the only way he's gonna make up for it is to please some owners. This move takes away prospects to build a better team once Brady eventually retires. It also gives incentive for BB to leave, too, if he feels he won't have any building blocks to make a new team once Brady leaves.  Brady and BB leaving, coupled with the Spygate punishments, our penchant for trading away 1st round picks to get more out of them and now this series of draft losses will certainly tank the team and let another market take over in the AFC."
Patriots,3cd5tw,psychosus,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:30:00 2015 UTC,"This is now my favorite theory and I will subscribe to it.  Do you have any evidence you could link to, perchance?"
Patriots,3cd5tw,chicomonk,4,Tue Jul 7 13:50:06 2015 UTC,"No, no evidence. Just a theory.   My train of thought on the matter:   Bill Polian, Tony Dungy and Indy - hated us ever since they drafted Peyton Manning and we beat the hell out of them during our championship years while he was racking up league MVPs but ending up 1-and-done in the playoffs. They finally beat us after years of complaining about roughing up their receivers and Polian was key in creating the illegal contact penalty while he was on the competition committee. Haven't beaten us in the playoffs except for 2006 and haven't beaten us at all since 2009. Chuck Pagano is the former Ravens DC.   Goodell - Former Jets employee. Spygate nonsense. Wants to make the league money at anyone's expense.   Jets - Hate us 'cause they ain't us. Haven't made playoffs since 2010 after impressive back to back AFC Championship appearances.  Miami - Haven't replicated success of '72 or the Dan Marino era since....well, 1972 and Marino's retirement in 1999. Was a big market team in the 80s and 90s because of Marino. Haven't made playoffs since 2008 and haven't won a playoff game since 2000.  Baltimore - Don Shula played for the Baltimore Colts. Haven't beat us since 2013 AFCC Game but put up a good fight in the 4 playoff games we've had against them. Harbaugh is disgruntled with being outplayed and outcoahed. They either lose to Pittsburg or us in the playoffs.   Denver - Snagged Peyton Manning. Beat us in AFCC Game in 2014 and then horribly lost to Seahawks. Manning hasn't looked good since. Hadn't previously beaten us in the playoffs since 2005.   Oakland - Tuck Rule game. Blew their chance for redemption against the Bucs in the Super Bowl the next year and Charles Woodson hasn't let it go since.   San Diego - We smashed their hopes of a Super Bowl return when we beat the 14-2 Chargers, the #1 seed in the AFC and Super Bowl favorite, in a divisional playoff game in en route to our only loss to Peyton Manning in the playoffs. The Chargers had a earned a reputation for taking Manning out of the playoffs and we're obviously upset to never get the chance that year. They were also pissed that we did a victory dance on their logo midfield. We beat them in the AFC Championship two years later and they have been lousy since (except for the beginning of last year when Rivers started to look like himself again).   Buffalo - Rex Ryan is bringing the Jets' jealousy of New England to Buffalo. The Colts have won the AFC East more recently than Buffalo.   Pittsburgh - 12 of the last 14 AFC Championship games have featured either New England or Pittsburgh. 2 of them featured both. Pittsburgh's historically tough defense stopped our 21 game win. We were the finese to their smash mouth, but we've given them some majorly embarassing losses, including both AFC Championship matches against them. We're also on their heels for Super Bow wins.   AFC - Since 2001, the Patriots have played in 6 Super Bowls and won 4. They have played in 9 of the last 14 AFC Championship games, winning 6. They have seeded 1st or 2nd in the conference 9 times since 2000. They have seeded 3rd once and 4th twice. They have won the AFC East 12 out of 14 times. The two times they didn't win they came in second and those are the only two seasons they missed the playoffs.   Interesting fact, 14 of the last 15 AFC Championship games have included either New England, Indianapolis, Baltimore or Pittsburgh. Half of those games featured two of the four.   Few other teams have rivaled New England's sustained accomplishments since 2001. I feel that gives a lot of teams reason to complain to Goodell and for the league to try to create parity instead of letting New England continue to dominate the AFC.  EDIT: Corrected years for Dolphins playoff appearances and wins."

Peyton thinks long and hard, looks God in the eye, and says, ""I believe in hard work, and in staying true to family and friends. I believe in giving. I always try to do right by my fans."" God can't help but see the essential goodness of Manning, and offers him a seat to his left.  Then God turns to Tony Romo and says, ""What do you believe?"" Tony says, ""I believe passion, discipline, courage and honor are the fundamentals of life. I've always tried to be a true sportsman, both on and off the playing field."" God is greatly moved by Tony's sincere eloquence, and offers him a seat to his right.  Finally, God turns to Tom Brady: ""And you, Tom, what do you believe?""

Right next door, there's a massive, gorgeous palace, draped in #12 flags and Patriots banners. Peyton goes running to God.   ""Why does Tom get a much nicer house than me?

Patriots,3cftwj,BURNEDandDIED,12,Tue Jul 7 23:45:59 2015 UTC,"They're built very similar to (albeit MUCH whinier than) the Patriots. They've got their core guys running their locker room. They've got a value attached to each position and do their best not to over spend. They run a lot more than people realize, and play a very dynamic defense that keeps you guessing. If you let the Ravens set the pace (the 2012 AFCCG comes to mind) you're in for a long day.    They're also waaaay full of themselves, and value a good excuse for losing as much as a win which are often their undoing."

Patriots,3cftwj,highlander2190,4,Tue Jul 7 23:01:04 2015 UTC,honestly i put it down to coaching. Its the only consistent thing they've had over all these years with their turnover on defense and the offense becoming more pass oriented than run. Harbaugh is a solid coach that knows how to coach his team up for the games against the pats. He does well against Bill and gives his team a better shot against the schemes that Bill draws up than if they were not to have him. Take away Harbaugh and we beat the Ravens 85% of the time.

Patriots,3cb9fd,MrVictor,17,Mon Jul 6 22:43:28 2015 UTC,Bad example? He fumbled there because he got KTFO. Hard to hold onto a ball when you are unconscious.
Patriots,3cb9fd,alisonstone,6,Mon Jul 6 23:35:35 2015 UTC,"This fumble is the type of fumble that Ridley deserves criticism for. He has a tendency to take the ball out of his chest when he attempts to spin/juke, which is fundamentally unsound. He lost a few of them this way, and he gets benched whenever he loses them due to poor technique. He stays in if he loses it due to good defensive play.  Statistically, Ridley doesn't fumble that much, but Belichick hates poor fundamentals that create unnecessary risks. Ridley seems to have fixed this bad habit last season because I don't remember seeing the ball stick out of his body any more, as compared to years before that."

Patriots,3cb9fd,pitabread12,5,Mon Jul 6 16:11:35 2015 UTC,It seemed like every qb sneak all year he would come in behind brady and push him if they didn't have the yards. Think it was a new development; either way it worked big time in the playoffs more than once.
Patriots,3cb9fd,adm7373,2,Mon Jul 6 16:12:33 2015 UTC,"Alright Develin, come on, we all know that's you..."
Patriots,3cb9fd,Bior37,8,Mon Jul 6 16:16:22 2015 UTC,Hey man I just appreciate good physical football.  Like when that one guy ran over a colts LB for a 1-yd TD catch in the AFC championship game.

Patriots,3cb9fd,hand_of_king,9,Tue Jul 7 05:11:12 2015 UTC,They really should've seen the first Brady sneak coming.  Why leave him such a big hole on a 4th and 1?  It's like they wanted him to get the 1st.
Patriots,3cb9fd,khjohnso,5,Mon Jul 6 16:54:48 2015 UTC,yeah was going to say that. the difference in preparations between BB and anyone else.
Patriots,3cb9fd,Toodrunk2dream,22,Mon Jul 6 18:16:18 2015 UTC,"I was at this game.  I bought four nose bleed bleacher seats on a drunken whim about three weeks before for about $200 a ticket; before the Kansas City game. I watched to my horror as tickets in my section nose dived after that Monday night to about $120.  Over-paying for nose bleeds coupled with the disappointment that I felt for this team that I had so much expectations for was overwhelming. I quickly texted a couple of friends trying to sell the tickets for a small loss, no takers though. I didn't want to overpay watching my team got blown out by a surging Bengals team.   But being able to look back in hindsight, I would have comfortably payed three times that number to be there and in that atmoshpere that night; even though I don't remember much of the fourth quarter."
Patriots,3cb9fd,1way2way3way4way,10,Mon Jul 6 16:25:57 2015 UTC,I was there too. The stadium was absolutely electric. Too bad it takes early/exaggerated reports of our demise for Gillette crowds to really get hyped up

Patriots,3cb9fd,whitecompass,6,Mon Jul 6 16:22:36 2015 UTC,"He described it perfectly, it was like a play off game for us. Just a completely different level of intensity. Everyone was tired of the media talking shit on Brady."

Patriots,3cb9fd,locallyunscene,3,Tue Jul 7 12:29:47 2015 UTC,Look at the Bengals' safety in the middle of the field on that first pass from scrimmage. Brady looked him off and broke his ankles in the process.

Patriots,3cb9fd,orm518,5,Mon Jul 6 21:29:15 2015 UTC,The second drive was awesome too.  14-0 before the Bengals knew what hit em.

Patriots,3cb9fd,Celltech10,2,Mon Jul 6 16:54:32 2015 UTC,The amount of force and frustration that went into the throw on the opening play should have been enough to convince all of America that ring number 4 was on the way.

I did get goosebumps. If tb line up against Cleveland I want nothing more than for him to fail but against any other team the passion and love I have for the pats feels just as genuine and deep rooted as any Patriots fan.

Patriots,3cf8jl,SDS1995,4,Tue Jul 7 13:22:32 2015 UTC,"Former intern here. God Training camp was hell for us, mostly because of the heat coming off the parking lot. It's a great event because it's free to attend, and the Krafts do a great job of trying to make it worth your while. Get there early for good bleacher seats, the stands fill up quickly. The attractions, inflatables, and the like are really for younger kids and you won't be missing out on anything unless you're a 65+ year old creeper who insists on getting cheerleader autographs. I don't know the schedule, but since you are travelling, I fully recommend arriving early to get situated, grabbing a bite at one of the fine, yet crowded dining establishments and wait until the crowd disperses following practice, and then you can pay homage to the greatest franchise ever at the Hall which is a Mecca for us Pats fans if you haven't been before. This way you can explore it without feeling rushed and appreciate it in all its glory."

Patriots,3cf8jl,Mayo96,2,Wed Jul 8 10:14:41 2015 UTC,How often does TB12 sign autographs? I'm from Massachusetts but I moved to Florida a few years back so i forgot how this shit works... I'm asking because i just had a son in November and i named him after my boy Tom (my sons name is Brady thought it sounded better) and i  want to get him a autograph from tom. FYI i'm flying up on July 30th
Patriots,3cf8jl,The_Hempest,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:23:30 2015 UTC,"Get there early, especially if you're going to the first couple practices. I like to sit on the grass hill. Get as close to the yellow rope as you can, you'll have a prime spot for autographs. Also snag one of the roster lists that they pass out, makes it easier to see who is doing what. After practice, grab lunch and bar crawl around Patriot Place."
Patriots,3cel0w,tommyonepin,4,Tue Jul 7 08:30:28 2015 UTC,"So before Deflategate came to pass I decided to book flights to come from the UK to MA to watch the first game (a life long dream), now I'm a little disappointed the game probably won't be the game I was hoping for.   Chances are Brady will start game 1.  Even if Goodell doesn't drop the suspension, Brady will likely take it to court who will postpone the suspension until they can reach a decision (likely months later)."
Patriots,3cel0w,djimbob,5,Tue Jul 7 20:07:40 2015 UTC,"It's easy enough to make friends when tailgating, just go in with an open mind and people will be more than happy to have you join them. Your story/English accent will be welcome for sure.   As far as tickets go just get them in hand asap, no point in stressing about it. Is it for the opening game?   How are you getting to the game?   Bringing an England flag too?! Would be awesome to represent that way I think!!"
Patriots,3cel0w,mbsdca,3,Wed Jul 8 10:07:47 2015 UTC,"You'd be more than welcome at our tailgate, and I'll be driving down from Boston. Shoot me a message if you're up for it.  Game tickets to the opener, especially a banner-raising opener, will be pricey but won't be impossible. I'd just keep an eye on all the reseller sites (StubHub, Craigslist, eBay, etc) and jump on a deal if you see one pop up."

Patriots,3cb9ks,DG_Broski,2,Mon Jul 6 16:36:52 2015 UTC,"Gronk is a bit of a throwback, but it's easier if you've got so much talent the money just flows, and opponents can't take the blows.

But also has limitations that an offensive coordinator has to scheme around. Having Marshawn Lynch and a legendary defense makes that easier.  11) Eli Manning, Giants  Certified field general with the willingness and ability to spot tight windows and thread the ball through.  10) Tony Romo, Cowboys  Playing behind the league’s best O-line has allowed him to polish many areas of his once inconsistent game.  9) Matt Ryan, Falcons  Newfound ability to play on the move could catapult him higher on this list, especially in Kyle Shanahan’s system.  8) Joe Flacco, Ravens  Maybe the strongest arm in the NFL (yes, arm strength matters), and he’s used it aptly in multiple schemes in recent years. It’s still incredible how little talk there is about his 2012 playoff run, which is probably the best ever.  7) Drew Brees, Saints  Physical skills are starting to wane, but being arguably the top pure progression passer in the league can obscure that.  6) Philip Rivers, Chargers  Outstanding on three-step, five-step and seven-step dropbacks. There’s little more a coach could ask for.  5) Ben Roethlisberger, Steelers  Has evolved from a randomized, talent-based quarterback to a fully cerebral field general. And the talent’s still there.  4) Peyton Manning, Broncos  Don’t let back-to-back ugly postseason losses (Colts last year, Seahawks the year before) overshadow back-to-back seasons of daunting statistics. Arm strength has never been his game; field command, fundamentals and IQ have. Those are all still fully intact.  3) Andrew Luck, Colts  Has a chance to one day reach the All-Time Mt. Rushmore, right up there with Brady, Montana and whoever else you have. Right now, he’s already the best play-extending pocket passer in the game, by far.  2) Aaron Rodgers, Packers  The most physically gifted passer in the league can also beat you with his brain.  1) Tom Brady, Patriots  No player of this era has done more with less. Talk to coaches around the league and they’ll tell you that however much command you think Brady has over that offense, triple it, and that’s about the actual amount.     I'd put Wilson just below Roethlisberger and bump Luck below Brees."

I think having Luck at #3 is ridiculous though."
Patriots,3caydx,douglasmacarthur,5,Mon Jul 6 16:21:36 2015 UTC,Yeah luck should not be ahead of Manning or even brees. They said don't let mannings postseason failures detract from him but that's exactly what they're doing. Especially since lucks back to back patriot losses are just as bad.

But this seems to be a ranking of last season / right now - where Brady had Gronk and Edelman so you can't really claim he's got no targets, even if we are weak at WR.  The most complete QB at present is Aaron Rodgers if we have to take off the homer cap."
Patriots,3caydx,Zerak-Tul,11,Mon Jul 6 16:22:06 2015 UTC,"""Most complete"" doesn't mean ""best"".  Brady did have weapons this year in terms of receivers but Rodgers has a much better OL (especially compared to our games without Stork), and having a much better ground game means he doesn't have to pass on as high a % of his snaps, both of which makes it a lot easier to have high rate stats. And Brady's mobility inside the pocket improved a lot this year.  I'm not saying Brady's definitely better though, and if you think Rodgers is better I respect that. I just think it's close enough that you can't write people off as homers if they put Brady #1."
Patriots,3caydx,douglasmacarthur,3,Mon Jul 6 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"That doesn't change the fact that Rodgers almost certainly wouldn't have done what Brady did this past postseason, down by the points that he was on so many occasions, and coming through each time.  That's an intangible that this list seems to account for. I think ""homer cap"" is unfair."
Patriots,3caydx,dtdroid,3,Mon Jul 6 18:36:31 2015 UTC,"Lets look at ""most complete"". Rodgers when he can run and evade pressure is probably the best, but what happened when he couldnt run everywhere? He didnt do a very good job in his reads against Seattle. And in fact made some poor decisions and overall had a pretty poor showing (a super shitty showing to be honest). Sure he usually has that mobility, but he didnt, and given the physical nature of football this isnt going to be the last time he is unable to run out of the pocket. Even if he could have theres plenty of teams in the nfl that will get to you anyway.  Meanwhile Brady carved up the LOB, and did better in both his showings against them than Rodgers has.  Im not saying one is better. I think they are equal, but id choose brady, just because even if he is unable to make extra time, he can still torch teams like Seattle. In fact Brady seems to need less and less time to torch defenses because hes gotten better at his reads and releases the ball so fast that Detroit, Baltimore and Seattles and Buffalo's (game 1) defenses all looked like shit against him. Rodgers meanwhile is getting too many excuses, and needs another ""if/but"" than Brady does to play at his top level. Brady didnt run or leave the pocket often against Seattle and still won. Until Rodgers can do that against the best teams without even needing to leave the pocket im gonna be on Bradys side in this argument. Rodgers may have more wow in his game, but Brady is king and im personally even more fascinated because he does it the way he does it."
Patriots,3caydx,mattsparrow,2,Mon Jul 6 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that Rodgers is the more physically gifted.  Nobody has his combination of strength and accuracy.  His deep passes are things of beauty, and he can regularly squeeze a throw through a seemingly impossible hole.  If I ran a downrange passing attack offense with a good offensive line capable of keeping someone upright, I'd pick Rodgers 10 times outta 10.  Rodgers may also have the best post snap reads in the game, which accounts for his almost unrealistically good TD/INT ratio.  Conversely, I feel like Brady is the better pre snap reader/play call adjuster, has a faster release, and has shown the ability to hit his receivers in stride in the short-intermediate passing game.  If I have a YAC based attack with a spotty offensive line with a system flexible enough for the QB to make last minute adjustments at the LOS, I'm taking Brady 10 times outta 10.  That said, I think Rodgers would do better in our system than Brady would do in GB's, but a lot of that I think comes from McDaniels being the better OC than McCarthy."

Come playoffs you want that can't loose Brady mentality.  He'll rally the oline.  The receivers will die for him catching the ball.

Patriots,3cdd0h,buttsoupjets,4,Tue Jul 7 04:33:14 2015 UTC,"11-5 against one of the easiest schedules in NFL history and the only time they've missed the playoffs since 2002. That was arguably the most talented Patriots team ever that Belichick got to coach without Brady and they still couldn't make the playoffs.   Also, part of the reason why Randy Moss took such a friendly deal that year after catching 23 touchdowns was because of who he was playing for - which included Tom Brady.   Had Brady gone down for the season before those negotiations were had, I bet it would have gone over much differently."
Patriots,3cdd0h,boricuanes,2,Tue Jul 7 04:48:22 2015 UTC,"Belichick's failures as a GM   This meme needs to die. I wrote this in a /r/nfl thread a while back.....  GM's have to consider the bigger picture (next 5 years) at all times which means that their primary goal should be annual, high level competitiveness. The Patriots have achieved this goal. This is a fact that cannot be disputed. Individual games (super bowls, conference championships, etc) are the small picture/details and anything can happen in the small sample that is a handful of these games - see helmet catch for an example. This is not the GM's fault.  GM Bill has gotten deserved criticism for some mistakes - Chad Jackson (and pretty much the entire '06 draft except Gostkowski) Haynesworth, Adalius Thomas, Maroney, Ochocinco, etc. But we forget that the draft (where arguably, most of his mistakes have been) is typically a crapshoot, and he's also gotten solid to excellent value for a number of mid to late picks - Brady, Edelman, Vollmer, Jarvis Green, Assante Samuel, David Givens, etc. He's also gotten good value for picks that were derided by many at the time such as Logan Mankins and Richard Seymour (the local papers were clamoring for David Terrel, receiver from Michigan).  And let's not forget the free agency wins from picking up low risk players like Vrabel, Ninkovich, Fauria. Even the FA mistakes have been, for the most part, low risk and easy to get rid of with minimal impact on the long term goals.  Had to get this off my chest because this 'GM Bill sucks' meme has started to annoy the shit out of me."
Patriots,3cdd0h,buttsoupjets,3,Tue Jul 7 02:00:41 2015 UTC,"Umm, I didn't say he sucks. I said that his failures would have been much more damaging if he didn't have a quarterback making 75% of his actual value that can apparently throw to a trash can on wheels if necessary. If the Patriots had to pay Brady a similar amount as Manning or Rodgers demand, Belichick's mishaps would be much more heavily scrutinized. Instead he gets much more leniency because Brady makes up for it.   In an article talking about cost efficiency, it shouldn't be against the rules to bring up that Belichick is playing with the most powerful card in the deck. Not only does Brady take less than he would very damn well earn elsewhere, but because Brady can thrive with anyone, Belichick is now allowed to do things like trading Deion Branch for a 1st rounder, or flipping Randy Moss for a 4th. Brady will go on, where most other quarterbacks wouldn't. The offense is going to score points because of Brady's incredible ability to adapt between receivers and offensive systems.   So now, not only do you have the most important position at a discounted rate (not of your own doing but of his) but you also get to pick and choose the rate at which you want to spend on all of his weapons.   Belichick doesn't suck as a GM. He's actually awesome (to me) for all of his trading shenanigans. But specifically regarding cost efficiency, specifically with it being applied across all sports, he's got a cheat code named Handsome Tom"

Patriots,3cdd0h,buttsoupjets,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:48:21 2015 UTC,"Every contract he's ever signed has always been for less than he could make. Guaranteed doesn't mean squat when he would get it anyway on a non-guaranteed contract.   Brady takes less and restructures his contract all the time so that he can win. Brady does that. If Belichick had to put together a team with a quarterback of Brady's caliber that didn't deliberately take less, he'd have at least $2-5 million a year less to work with than with Brady."
Patriots,3cdd0h,CC333,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:32:52 2015 UTC,"Brady's restructures never, ever hurt Brady. He gets a TON OF signing bonus that doesn't affect his yearly cap hit, and he greatly improves his guaranteed money. You can't possibly say guaranteed doesn't mean squat in the NFL. One play can end his career, he could be cut eventually for another QB, etc.  Brady foesnt get hurt when the TEAM approaches him for a contract restructure."

Brady makes less money because he values winning and money isn't an issue for him. With another quarterback, money would be an issue and Belichick wouldn't get free cap space like he does with Brady"

Patriots,3cbzry,dmacisabeast,17,Mon Jul 6 18:58:11 2015 UTC,"It's kind of apples and oranges with Chung and Harmon, Harmon was used in situations where the Pats needed a second deep safety while Chung typically played up in the box. Both have their own place in the defense.  With weaker corners and a stronger front (on paper) I expect Harmon to get more snaps then last year but Chung probably still sees more. It's possible we don't have a clear ""starter"" at strong safety.  Richards is kind of a wildcard, hard to say what his role will be before we see him on an NFL field. I would guess he spends his first season playing special teams and backing up Chung."
Patriots,3cbzry,mrprpl,9,Mon Jul 6 19:40:45 2015 UTC,"Finally there is Richards, a second round pick who is smart but unathletic.   2nd fastest 3 cone time at the combine for safeties, 8th fastest 20 yard shuttle, 3rd fastest 60 yard shuttle, top 15 in 3 other drills."
Patriots,3cbzry,swantonsoup,3,Mon Jul 6 23:05:07 2015 UTC,Belechick loves his 3 cone drills... I'm guessing that change of direction and acceleration allows you to more easily recover from a mistake and better stay with a double-move.
Patriots,3cbzry,textbooksforrent,6,Tue Jul 7 13:20:58 2015 UTC,"Best guess:  Chung, by contract extension, looks slated to be the hitter S in front of D-Mac.  I'm not sure which of the safeties they're going to use as substitutes and which they're going to keep as ST exclusives, but I don't see Richards getting defensive snaps.  Harmon/Ebner/Wilson have a camp battle in front of them."
Patriots,3cbzry,zipperoooo,9,Mon Jul 6 19:21:07 2015 UTC,"To start the season my best guess is that Chung will win the starting job.  He has familiarity with the system and played well enough last year.  Obviously it's up for grabs and the starter could be swapped out at any time, but starter for week 1 my money is on Chung."
Patriots,3cbzry,bab00ngeneral,4,Mon Jul 6 19:01:45 2015 UTC,I like how Chung played this year but without having top tier corners Chungs weakness' really show through. Hence why we let him go in the first place. I'm guessing it will be Harmon and then Richards for that spot leaving Chung on the outside fighting for reps. I see Richards being the type of player that Weddle is. Not overwhelming like Thomas or Chancellor but has the brain to be extremely effective.
Patriots,3cbzry,handheldcoma,8,Mon Jul 6 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"My guess is that Richards was picked and will be groomed for the SS job.  He was described as a ""coach on the field"" by his teammates, which is exactly what Belichick wants.  Considering the SS this year will likely be required less for run support and more for zone coverage, I think the starting job will be up for grabs among the top-4:  Chung, Harmon, Wilson, Richards."
Patriots,3cbzry,venture70,3,Mon Jul 6 19:17:52 2015 UTC,Harmon. He was taking snaps when we were playing two deep. Fletcher was pretty good in cover 2 and so was Logan Ryan so I'm guessing that will all lead to Harmon taking the job.
Patriots,3cbzry,kksred,2,Mon Jul 6 20:04:19 2015 UTC,"This is another positional battle that has a blurry definition of ""starter"". Barring Richards taking the job, Chung will probably wind up with the second most snaps at safety but I don't think Harmon will be far off."

Give him the reps, put him out there, let him get burnt (a couple times, maybe) and see how he responds.  Guys like Chung, Harmon, etc...will benefit more from the rest before a a very long season.  Although, if you really mean starting (the first) actual game, the first series of it, it's more Chung's to lose than Harmon's or Richard's to earn.   Of course, you can lose it just by health or other such contemporaneous such factors."

Patriots,3cbxpu,TB12toJE11,2,Tue Jul 7 19:33:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think they can force Goodell to rule faster (the purpose of an injunction is normally to enjoin or prevent something), but I believe they can get one that prevents a suspension (if any remains) from going into effect until the full process has worked itself out."
Patriots,3cbxpu,ctpatsfan77,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:37:49 2015 UTC,Interesting. I was under the impression that they could only get the injunction after the ruling and Goodell would take as much time as possible so that Brady has less time to get an injunction before the season starts. This forces Brady to serve suspended games during the injunction process making the injunction pointless. I'm not a lawyer and shit so I have no idea wtf is going down anymore.
Patriots,3cbxpu,TB12toJE11,3,Tue Jul 7 19:41:50 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why injunctions exist; the harm caused if Brady is forced to sit for an unjust suspension cannot be undone, while there is no fundamental harm caused by issuing the injunction.

Patriots,3cbxpu,AmericanFartBully,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:52:48 2015 UTC,"And, gee, the NFLPA won't give them that. I wonder why not. /s  Seriously, though, a big part of the problem is that their hands are really tied here. The report is truly flimsy evidence on which to base a suspension (since there's not even any hard proof that there was either an actual deflation of the balls used in this game, nor is there any hard proof—even a text message—suggesting illegal deflation of the footballs). In the absence of that, all they have left is failure to cooperate, and that's already been declared not suspension-worthy. So if they try to reduce it to one game (or two) for failure to cooperate, the NFLPA will cry foul. If they don't reduce it to zero, Brady and/or the NFLPA will probably sue. And if they do give in, 31 fanbases will be pissed off to  no end.  Reap the f—ing whirlwind, Roger."

Patriots,3ccmsl,tylers_bum,17,Mon Jul 6 21:38:12 2015 UTC,"Prior to the AFCCG the Colts notified the NFL that they were concerned the Patriots deflated footballs. The NFL ignored the Colts.   This is important as it implies there wasn't any sort of sting by the NFL against the Patriots, but rather that they just didn't care and didn't view ball pressure as a serious issue.   It wasn't until the Colts GM actually started screaming to NFL officials during the AFCCG, after the game had started, that the NFL started to do anything.   Immediately following the game the fact that the NFL would be investigating was leaked by someone very close to Colts ownership. This in and of itself should never happen. We aren't supposed to know about investigations until they're done. For example, the NFL had been investigating Bountygate for a long time before we even knew there was an investigation.   In the following week Chris Mortensen reports that 11 of 12 balls were significantly underinflated at halftime, all by around 2PSI.   This isn't true. The balls weren't underinflated that much. Moreover, the NFL knew they weren't. Instead of correcting Mortensen's report, who's generally considered a well connected and informed reporter, the NFL didn't say anything while the false information was widely reported.   Worse, they didn't even tell the Patriots. In fact, they didn't tell them for months, despite repeated requests by the Patriots.   In the ensuing weeks, the NFL hires Wells to do an investigation which ends up costing over $5m and everyone tries to become an expert on pressure and gas laws.   This is all meant to show that up to this point, it's an extremely uncontrolled and chaotic fiasco with leaks and speculation all over the place and the NFL making no attempt to clear the air.   The NFL release the much awaited Wells Report and it leaves pretty much everyone confused. Wells makes a number of assumptions and assertions. Lots of information is ignored, left out, or actually altered.   The report starts off stating that the NFL considers their ref above reproach in regards to his recollections about what happened game night.   Yet later on it asserts that he's incorrect, says he must have been wrong, and reinterprets information given to him. The report very clearly states that Wells and the NFL are ignoring the opinion of the game ref to reinterpret information to fit the narrative that the Patriots are guilty.   Following the Wells Report, the NFL hands down the harshest sanctions in league history.   If it were even possible, that makes the who situation make less sense.   The penalties are so out of scope, even assuming the Patriots are guilty, that it's almost universally agreed that the NFL went way too far.   For example, when Brett Favre refused to hand over his phone to the NFL for the investigation into him texting dick pics, he was fined $50,000.   For the same thing, Brady refusing to hand over his phone, he was suspended for 4 games and essentially fined $2,000,000.  The NFL also made reference to Spygate in their decisions, which I think confused a lot of people. It just seemed strange for the NFL to want to further penalize the Patriots for something that happened 8 years earlier.   TL;DR - The NFL ran a very poor investigation and allowed misinformation to be reported, presumably to turn public opinion against the Patriots. They then admittedly altered information to fit a pre-drawn conclusion and then incredibly harshly penalized the Patriots for something they obviously didn't care about in the first place."
Patriots,3ccmsl,Fuqwon,6,Tue Jul 7 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"Two additional pieces of information that should be explicitly mentioned are that the Panthers were caught on video violating the same rules and givenzero ppunishment, and that the ideal gas law shows that the patriots balls could easily be explained purely from being outside in the cold before being measured again."
Patriots,3ccmsl,okthrowaway2088,3,Tue Jul 7 02:14:32 2015 UTC,"Also needs to be said that Jim Nantz and Phil Sims, in the broadcast of the Pats vs GB, stated that Aaron Rodgers told them before the game that ""I like to push the limit to how much air we can put in the football, even go over what they allow you to do and see if the officials take air out of it."" Sims then stated ""You know, the officials do check those footballs and sometimes maybe even get lucky and put an extra half pound of air in there to help Aaron Rodgers out.""   I don't think think people get the severity of this in comparison to what Brady was accused of. We're talking about officials not even inspecting the balls because they don't care. Worse than that, catching the infraction and turning a blind eye. And even worse actually conspiring with Rodgers to help him cheat by adding the extra air pressure for him.   Was an investigation launched on Rodgers and his crooked officials? Nope. Did PTI and First Take, and the rest of the BS blow hard media call Rodgers crooked and tainted? No. Did the fans go crazy on blogs and Reddit calling Rodgers a cheat? No. And nor should they have. I didn't give a shit. Nobody gave a shit. Just shows what a witch hunt this whole thing has been.   http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2015/01/20/packers-aaron-rodgers-prefers-overinflated-footballs-likes-to-push-the-limit/"
Patriots,3ccmsl,BG1234567,2,Tue Jul 7 05:30:53 2015 UTC,"One of the major things that gets ignored is that the balls were at 72 degrees when tested in a 72 degree degree room, with a pressure gauge that had been in that 72 degree room. I don't remember specifics but temperatures on the field where the balls ended up, were much lower, so the temperature of the balls dropped significantly. When the Colts player made the interception, and turned the ball over to his equipment manager who then handed the ball over to a league official. The official then tested the colder ball with a pressure gauge that had been sitting outside, exposed to the much cooler temperatures. Thus calling into question the integrity of the of the in-game examination of the balls.  There was a story that at some point another league official switched one of the balls out for another so he could sell a game-used ball (on E-Bay I think). Not sure whatever came of that story."

Patriots,3c7dpf,mcorcoran3,14,Sun Jul 5 16:03:22 2015 UTC,I will be watching two of those games
Patriots,3c7dpf,TheArcReactor,7,Sun Jul 5 16:59:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not sure if I need to see the Packers game. I want to imagine Logan Ryan at his best, not his worst, since we need him to be a starter this year"
Patriots,3c7dpf,TheArcReactor,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:01:12 2015 UTC,that's pretty much my thinking
Patriots,3c7dpf,CircularMatrix,5,Sun Jul 5 17:06:32 2015 UTC,Why would you want to give Goodell the ratings?
Patriots,3c7dpf,ctpatsfan77,0,Sun Jul 5 17:31:32 2015 UTC,"More importantly: unless you're a Nielsen viewer (and you know if you are), you don't actually matter."
Patriots,3c7dpf,saptsen,2,Sun Jul 5 18:45:26 2015 UTC,"Cable/satellite boxes track what you're watching, and I'd guess that this information is shared with the channels they broadcast."
Patriots,3c7dpf,TheArcReactor,-1,Sun Jul 5 23:12:09 2015 UTC,Cause one more viewer will change basically nothing. My ability to effect the nfl is too small to worry about that sort of thing.
Patriots,3c7dpf,ukez,4,Sun Jul 5 18:17:24 2015 UTC,"If everyone thought that way, nothing in the world would ever change."
Patriots,3c7dpf,TheArcReactor,5,Sun Jul 5 22:36:38 2015 UTC,"This is true but I like football and am not willing to quit watching programs from the NFL or its partners (if you are going to boycott the NFL Network, logic would follow you wouldn't watch the broadcasts on their partners on TV).  I would rather fight for universal healthcare or ending poverty or increasing public housing than getting all activist about the NFL. That said, it is good to be a thinking consumer, so I respect your decision not to watch the NFLn."
Patriots,3c7dpf,saptsen,0,Mon Jul 6 00:09:12 2015 UTC,"You're right, but you also have to pick your battles. We're not talking about human rights or protecting the planet here, we're talking about a sport. This isn't gun violence or chemical warfare, this is people running around on the field trying to get a piece of inflated leather. Football may be a cultural bookmark but in the grand scheme of history Roger Goodell is not going to be remembered and whatever atrocities he inflicts upon players I like will be insignificant outside the world of football fans."

Roger Goodell's doled out some real shitty punishments, sure, but are you telling me that you have to fight every battle? Do his shitty punishments have an effect on human rights or the environment? If Goodell comes out and says that from now on all water in California should be diverted to it's NFL stadiums, then yeah, lets fucking do something about him... but a shitty punishment, even one that effects my team in such a big way, is going to be small banana's in the annals of history."

Patriots,3c7dpf,makethemsayayy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:28:51 2015 UTC,"I would note that I think people should vote because it is easy enough to do it and it can make a difference with local elections (though the presidential elections are never decided by MA). But voting is fairly inconsequential in the fight for social justice -- direct action, civil disobedience etc... is much more effective. To many people (not you) think voting is the be all/end all of civic engagement, but it barely dents anything -- especially given the way the elections are funded and the electoral college.  Referendums are a nice exception to this though -- that is pretty damn close to direct democracy and is reason enough to vote in MA since we often have important referendums on the ballot.   So I agree with you that small actions are important; but have you really stopped watching NFL programs all together? What about the games? Do you stream them all?"
Patriots,3c7dpf,douglasmacarthur,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:12:48 2015 UTC,"I will preface this by saying that someone can hold an opinion regardless of their own actions, but yes, I've stopped giving anything to the NFL.  I set up a workaround to get NFL gamepass and no longer purchase merchandise or tickets. I had previously spent money on the league (through supporting the Patriots) since 1994. I stopped when evidence was overwhelming for CTE and the NFL coverup.  As a physician that issue alone was enough for me to say ""enough is enough"" with football. So yeah, maybe I'm hypocritical because I still watch and thoroughly enjoy the sport, but I know I will never have my kids play or spend a dime on injuries others will sustain."

Patriots,3c8g88,mcorcoran3,11,Sun Jul 5 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"Hopefully madden 16 fixes a lot of things. I'm a big fan of ultimate team but it's such bullshit now. I spend like a million coins on my offensive line yet my opponents 85 overall players beat them off the edge.   Also, there's nothing worse than seeing nothing but green grass in front of you playing as Jamaal Charles, just to see some random MLB running a 4.3 and shoelace tackling you. They need to do what NCAA 14 did and make fast players fast and slow players slow. I'm sick of playing as 99 Vick and not being able to escape from guys like Wilfork.   You just can't have any explosive plays anymore like you could in the old maddens. I used to play madden '05 and just run circles around defenses with speedy players. Now I'm playing as Tavon Austin and am having trouble escaping one players without getting a shitty animation. I'm almost sure I'll buy madden 16 because I have all of the maddens going back to '03, but I'm losing faith in EA."
Patriots,3c8g88,ArDariusStewart13,3,Sun Jul 5 23:52:38 2015 UTC,"Have you tried adjusting the minimum speed threshold? Not sure how much it helps but lots of people suggest it. I agree Madden has been getting increasingly complacent -- especially in franchise/cfm mode, which is how I play. The CPU AI is so dumb (starting CBs with 59 speed!), being 60 million below the cap for 10 straight seasons (I assume this has to do with revenue but I don't even use owner mode)."
Patriots,3c8g88,kksred,5,Mon Jul 6 00:06:08 2015 UTC,Yeah.. no. Its been a while since madden gave a pats rookie star dev.
Patriots,3c8g88,1627581927516,19,Sun Jul 5 22:52:03 2015 UTC,"In fairness to Madden, it's been a while since the Pats have drafted a high profile rookie."
Patriots,3c8g88,Foxborough,2,Mon Jul 6 00:08:43 2015 UTC,Drafting him at 32 probably helps his case as well since he was projected much higher. Gives him somewhat of a chip on his shoulder.
Patriots,3c8g88,mastererrl,3,Mon Jul 6 01:44:24 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't even know how they decide who gets those nice dev traits -- I know Manziel had star, which is insane. But I am basically throwing shit at a wall here on dev trait"

Patriots,3c8g88,MaigoULTD,8,Sun Jul 5 22:41:43 2015 UTC,Madden has been sucking a lot since they got the exclusive rights deal with the NFL --no competition has them lazy and complacent. But it's the only console game in town. I may try Head Coach 09.
Patriots,3c8g88,thehonbtw,2,Sun Jul 5 23:31:53 2015 UTC,HIGHLY recommend Head Coach 09. One of the last great football games made in the past few years.

One thing I hate is that introduce some great ideas then just sideline them after a few iterations instead of continuing to improve. They added superstar mode in 2006, added onto it each year until 2010, and then have pretty much told it to be quiet and sit in the corner for the last 5 years."
Patriots,3c8g88,NSave,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"This is basically true save for a few tweaks and having online play with enough active users. I actually doubt I will buy 16 actually. I can download the new rosters now and I hate the changes they mad to CFM, especially scouting."

Patriots,3c63an,status253,7,Sun Jul 5 06:42:22 2015 UTC,The good old 3rd down Bledsoe to Coates connection.
Patriots,3c63an,ChetHerbie,5,Sun Jul 5 08:24:07 2015 UTC,There were a few years where I'd argue he was the best TE in the league. My favorite Coates moment was a game against the Dolphins in '96 where they had kept him quiet the first half and then on back to back possessions in the second half he goes for a 25 yard td and an 80 yard td.
Patriots,3c63an,sirtinykins,3,Sun Jul 5 18:19:03 2015 UTC,"Coates was the jam in NFL 95. I think the next leading receiver was Vincent Brisby, so you weren't left with a lot of options if you wanted to be your home team. Great and way underrated TE, very athletic and had great hands in a time when TEs were largely still just big oafs that weren't really expected to be receiving threats."
Patriots,3c63an,BURNEDandDIED,3,Sun Jul 5 17:00:12 2015 UTC,Coates was the man. At one point he was up there with Tony Gonzalez in the 90s as 2 of the best tight ends in the NFL. Love him growing up

Patriots,3c63an,scrimrot,2,Mon Jul 6 16:04:38 2015 UTC,"He deserves to be talked about the same way Shannon Sharpe is. Any time the play fell apart, Bledsoe found Coates and Coates pulled it down out of tight or double coverage."
Patriots,3c5ss6,2big_2fail,6,Sun Jul 5 02:19:52 2015 UTC,"But ultimately, Jean did not punch himself a spot among the 256 draft selections less than two months later.  Instead, he signed a three-year, $1.575 million contract with the Patriots shortly thereafter.   This contract part is so misleading.  This is the only contract the pats can offer any undrafted free agent -- the minimum salary and it has to be for the next three years.  More likely that not little to none of that money is guaranteed if he doesn't make the 53-man roster.  To quote this article on La'El Collins:   As an undrafted free agent, Collins has no choice but to accept a three-year contract that will be essentially for the minimum salary each year — $435,000 in 2015, $525,000 in 2016 and $615,000 in 2017 [which totals $1.575M]. Teams are allowed to spend up to nearly $87,000 in signing bonus money on undrafted players, but that amount is for all undrafted signings, not each individual player.    (So the $87k in bonus money if evenly split would amount to about $12k per UDFA player.)"

Patriots,3c42u1,2big_2fail,3,Sun Jul 5 02:54:41 2015 UTC,Rookie Jimmy Jean is older than both. He was born 4/1/1989. He reminds me of Kenbrell Thompkins and I'm rooting for him. Brandon Browner showed the value of a tall cornerback.

Patriots,3c8fnn,GlowInTheDarkNinjas,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:20:00 2015 UTC,why were these ones notable
Patriots,3c8fnn,king0fklubs,-1,Mon Jul 6 19:48:05 2015 UTC,"Eli was because the bastard beat us twice in the superbowl Then a card with Peyton on it whom Brady is continuously compared to Wilson because he's passing, and the Butler INT The successor to the butt fumble A longtime guy for one of our division rivals"
Patriots,3c5e37,mcorcoran3,4,Sat Jul 4 23:28:38 2015 UTC,"a good mix of cover 2 and 4, and occasionally 3. more of 3 and man when Talib showed up. Bill never stuck with one zone specifically. he tried to disguise alot (especially against manning). But his defenses were pretty conservative, a lot of bend but don't break"
Patriots,3c5e37,zwimberger,2,Sun Jul 5 01:11:46 2015 UTC,"Well there are 3 basic types of zones. Cover 2,3,4...teams that run primarily zone will use these based off of certain downs and distances. Then you have zone blitzes where you send additional rushers sacrificing a part of the zone defense or making it to certain players have to cover more space. I expect Bill to utilize all of these tactics."
Patriots,3c5e37,VGP_SC,2,Sun Jul 5 01:12:02 2015 UTC,It was a lot of cover 2. Cover 2 becomes cover 4 very quickly - depending on offense's alignment. It sucked because we didnt have good safeties.
Patriots,3c5e37,swantonsoup,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:57:37 2015 UTC,Which is why I have zero fricken clue on why people have been talking about McCourty moving back to CB.
Patriots,3c5e37,JustinC00,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:07:03 2015 UTC,"A lot of media people say it, not too many posters here though. I can see some rationale for it though -- you could argue a secondary of McCourty, Butler, Harmon, Chung is better than a secondary of Butler, Ryan, Chung and McCourty -- in other words Harmon is less of a risk than Logan Ryan or Bradley Fletcher.   But, I still hope it doesn't happen (save for maybe a few plays to throw defenses of)"
Patriots,3c5e37,2big_2fail,2,Sun Jul 5 23:00:37 2015 UTC,"I think people will be surprised the scheme won't change much. Fletcher, Butler and Ryan have predominantly played man-to-man."
Patriots,3c5e37,Candiana,2,Sun Jul 5 02:36:48 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but there's a difference between man to man when you can completely abandon one side of the field and when you can't. I think you'll likely see the safeties back more instead of down in front helping with slot receivers or run-blitzes.   But, with a rejuvenated, more aggressive front 7, leaving the safeties back might not hurt much."
Patriots,3c5e37,2big_2fail,2,Sun Jul 5 03:40:09 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Everything starts at the line of scrimmage. People obsess about cornerbacks too much.
Patriots,3c5e37,TheArcReactor,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:11:13 2015 UTC,"Well... to be fair we did just see what happens when you have a great corner. That being said, on defense the two groups feed of each other. Great play from your front seven makes the d-backs jobs easier, and great play from your d-backs does the same for the front seven."
Patriots,3c5e37,H_to_Tha_OV,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:09:40 2015 UTC,but do you think they will only have 1 deep safety -- kind of scary.
Patriots,3c5e37,bigevil80,2,Sun Jul 5 22:58:18 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but McCourty has so much range that you would expect any D to use more ""single high"" looks. I think we'll see a good mix of cover 1, cover 3, and quarters robber shells. I also think we'll see a lot of press-zone regardless of zone vs man."

Patriots,3c3z02,buttsoupjets,4,Sun Jul 5 02:01:20 2015 UTC,"Anyone who boasts about Rodger's ANY/A or passer rating doesn't know anything about his career. He got to sit behind a HOFer, take over a stacked team, and always have good receivers.  Sound familiar? It should. The last guy with the same circumstances was Steve Young, who was doing the exact same thing Rodgers was in the 90s.   Their careers are so similar and we're seeing more similarities with Rodgers getting random injuries."
Patriots,3c3z02,SpecOpBeevee,3,Sat Jul 4 22:25:15 2015 UTC,"Even last year Brady was the better QB .... Rodgers was working with Nelson, Cobb, and Lacy, the best WRs/RB duo last year, along with maybe the best pass blocking Oline as well.....

Who might be particularly enticed at the prospect of a 1-year, prove-it type of deal.  Not that anyone can necessarily expect this to be one particular type of player versus another (e.g experienced FA CB) just because of too many variables, i.e. (driven as much by health/injury versus camp performance).  Plus, there's probably a few unsigned players, that, right now, they've already been in ongoing talks with.  So, I'm guessing the Patriots are just giving themselves a bit more cushion in that area, to be able to absorb more players, more quickly, as they become available on the market and they might need to make a bunch of quick decisions."

Collins definitely has the higher coverage ceiling though."

Spread rb's are usually covered with some sort of nickel scheme. The reason Collins was assigned to gio was because he can actually d up quicker players.

Some of that may be because he generally got easier assignments   He said that hightower might have been more effective in coverage because he had easier assignments, if I'm reading correctly"
Patriots,3c3bca,lol_What_Is_Effort,2,Sat Jul 4 18:13:00 2015 UTC,"Ahh shit, yeah i read that wrong. Im sorry, im hungover as shit. But to that point, the fact that they wont put hightower on an rb is a farily good indicator of ability."
Patriots,3c3bca,bundleogrundle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:15:42 2015 UTC,No I didn't? I said Collins was on Bernard and Hightower wouldn't be given him..
Patriots,3c3bca,qwert_trewq,2,Sat Jul 4 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i read your comment wrong. I see your point now."
Patriots,3c3bca,bundleogrundle,2,Sat Jul 4 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Hightower as an OLB, rushing the passer. He was absolutely amazing at it, before we had to move him back to ILB."
Patriots,3c3bca,Kevin_Jim,12,Sun Jul 5 05:40:13 2015 UTC,Both of them could be rushing at any time. That is what having Jerrod Mayo back will allow us to do. I hate seeing people list him as someone we have to trade or cut because of his contract. He is worth every penny and with him back there in coverage it will free up Collins and Hightower and allow them to be more aggressive.
Patriots,3c3bca,bicket6,-10,Sat Jul 4 11:03:12 2015 UTC,"i dunno about that, mayo is pretty average/bad at coverage.  i really wanted spikes back :/"
Patriots,3c3bca,Jam_with_me,15,Sat Jul 4 11:27:40 2015 UTC,Are you saying Spikes was a better coverage LB? That's a unique opinion...
Patriots,3c3bca,joeycrose,8,Sat Jul 4 14:34:40 2015 UTC,What a nice way to tell him he's wrong.
Patriots,3c3bca,bicket6,6,Sat Jul 4 14:46:32 2015 UTC,no i didn't imply that. i just wanted spikes back.
Patriots,3c3bca,localhost87,6,Sat Jul 4 15:37:56 2015 UTC,I wholeheartedly disagree.
Patriots,3c3bca,abmmm,4,Sat Jul 4 14:28:11 2015 UTC,"Uhhh, Spikes was good at stopping the run. He was notoriously bad in coverage."
Patriots,3c3bca,bicket6,-5,Sat Jul 4 14:57:07 2015 UTC,Mayo is shit in coverage too. Spikes is awful in man to man but I've seen him make some decent plays in zone.
Patriots,3c3bca,abmmm,2,Sat Jul 4 15:36:22 2015 UTC,Mayo is shit in coverage too   No he is not.
Patriots,3c3bca,timrulz53,-1,Sun Jul 5 13:28:59 2015 UTC,He's pretty garbage. But he is good at wrapping up after the guy he was covering makes the catch.
Patriots,3c3bca,ImNotSalinger,3,Sun Jul 5 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"With those two we have an insane ability to threaten double A-gap pre-snap. We did it a bunch later in the season and with such legitimate pass rush threats it's so hard for the center and guards to compensate.  Especially with Mayo coming back and providing a better option as the third linebacker in coverage we wouldn't even really have to sacrifice that much to put that kind of heat on the interior line regularly.  Also on the Hightower/Collins coverage comparison: They're different types of coverage players. While Hightower did take a huge step up in his man coverage last year, he's still not stellar in man. He did get excellent at holding the middle zone. Collins definitely has a higher coverage ceiling though. Last year against the Broncos he handled a decent amount of man coverage as well as a decent amount of zone coverage. Check out Collins taking out Sanders on crossing routes all day, which is huge."
Patriots,3c3bca,mattsparrow,3,Sat Jul 4 18:39:00 2015 UTC,"I think all of our LBs are going to do a little bit of everything. With Sheard, we have 4 stellar pass rusher and run stoppers as well as 3 guys that are well above average covering the zone short pass. Then theres Collins who can hang in man with TEs. Idk I think our LB corp will be able to kinda do everything at anytime needed.  Let's just hope for a healthy season after Hightower returns."
Patriots,3c3bca,livinlifeontheedge,4,Sat Jul 4 14:33:06 2015 UTC,"hightower gets better coverage grades because he isnt asked to cover the same guys collins covers. they are both good in coverage but collins is better, while they are both good against the run but hightower is stellar. now they both rush the passer well so i hope to see them both do it plenty. mayo can also blitz well and defend the run very well, though hes probably the worst in coverage of the three. hes still average to slightly below average in coverage though, so im hella happy to be getting him back."
Patriots,3c3bca,mcorcoran3,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:35:23 2015 UTC,"Collins is easily a top 5 cover linebacker in the league, he's way ahead of Hightower in terms of coverage which is why he usually stays back instead of rushing."
Patriots,3c3bca,BURNEDandDIED,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:02:22 2015 UTC,"I agree. If he was a full-time pass rusher he would be amazing, but he is so valuable elsewhere, I don't know if BB would want to unleash him on the edge too much."
Patriots,3c3bca,TheArcReactor,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:15:01 2015 UTC,"There was a great thread a week or two ago about the use of ""sugaring"" the middle linebackers (threatening the A gap with two middle backers to throw off blocking schemes). Both Collins and Hightower were used for this. Again, that's through the A gap, not off the edge."
Patriots,3c3bca,H_to_Tha_OV,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:39:48 2015 UTC,"I think he's a good rusher, but I'd like to know how many of those attempts came where he was one of only 4 guys rushing or if they usually came with more than that. I think his athleticism and instincts are what pushes him above Hightower (though, I think he's really just faster).  I think Bill is going to have a blast with the front seven. With the addition of Sheard and Mayo coming back he can send any backer at any time now, it's going to make the Pats front seven much harder to deal with."
Patriots,3c3bca,jrdnism,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:16:09 2015 UTC,"I think BB will dig into his old playbooks for LT. People think I'm nuts for the comparison, but the measurables and instincts are uncanny IMHO."

Patriots,3bzx3u,tuckrman,3,Sun Jul 5 03:50:55 2015 UTC,"ok so the play worked great and both guys are fantastic players...  But isn't the head nod Brady gave basically telegraphing for the defense? I mean maybe he did it intentionally to psych them out, kinda like reverse mind games... but normally you don't want a QB affirming he is going to look for a specific player before the snap...  am I totally off on this? You don't want to let the defense read your QBs eyes, let alone see him affirming his target."
Patriots,3bzx3u,ConcedeDota,7,Fri Jul 3 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"10 Patriots in a jumbo goal line package with the equivalent number of Broncos in goal line D. Gronk wide left by 10 yards with 1 on 1 coverage.  All gronk has to do is beat his man inside which is easy for a guy that size. There was no way that LOLB/S was going to tip the ball with the distance between.   I think the nod was more of a, ""Perfect call, the defense is doing exactly what we want, run the route and it is a simple pass and TD"""
Patriots,3bzx3u,tuckrman,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:12:25 2015 UTC,54 on defense could have tried to intercept the slant and pull a Butler.
Patriots,3bzx3u,jrdnism,5,Fri Jul 3 19:14:22 2015 UTC,No chance of that. Had 54 started moving to the flats to pick/tip that ball TB could have easily seen it coming unlike the Butler/Browner pick+interception play.   Also check what Gronk does in the second after the snap. He stutter steps and leans outside for a moment turning the CBs hips as he cuts back inside just as the play call would have been drawn up leaving a gap in the left side flats for an open Gronk.
Patriots,3bzx3u,mk72206,3,Fri Jul 3 19:20:32 2015 UTC,Yea I wonder the same thing. Doesn't at least 1 guy on the defense see that and try to blow up the slant?
Patriots,3bzx3u,SerBearistanSelmy,2,Fri Jul 3 19:06:34 2015 UTC,The only guy even close is Vonn Miller and Gronk is strong enough to box him out. Miller also needs to think about the corner route as well. Both are very high percentage catches for Gronk in that situation.

Patriots,3c0a2u,Iglen31,12,Fri Jul 3 17:46:27 2015 UTC,"Rodgers is starting to become Manning-esque. He's lucky he got a SB early. But now it's 4 years, next year if he doesn't make the SB it will be 5 years since his last SB appearance. In that same time Brady has been to 2 more.  Longest Brady has gone without a SB appearance is 2 seasons.   Rodgers' playoffs  '09- One and Done  '10- 4-0 SB  '11- One and Done (#1 seed)   '12- 1-1 (The win was against the Joe Webb QB'd Vikings)  '13- One and Done  '14- 1-1   Overall Record 6-5   Since winning the SB 2-4    Manning-esque.  Best passer in the league? Ya probably.  Best QB in the league? Nope."
Patriots,3c0a2u,JustinC00,19,Fri Jul 3 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"Brady can will a team to the Super Bowl. Rodgers is accurate and very good, sure. But nobody has the drive and refusal to lose like Brady.  I think the incredible playoff comebacks this year showed why he has the best playoff record of any QB."

Patriots,3c0a2u,KeyTBoi,0,Sat Jul 4 13:06:44 2015 UTC,"Then how come he is 2-4 since he won the SB if he's been so great? Don't give me that ""defense"" or ""injuries"" bullshit. Brady has never gotten that benefit."
Patriots,3c0a2u,JustinC00,2,Sat Jul 4 14:57:10 2015 UTC,"Rodgers was great in 4 out of those 6 games. He was great in 2 of his losses.  He could very easily be 4-4 or 6-2 since he won the Super Bowl. Just like Brady could very easily be 6-0 in Super Bowls.  If a QB loses in the playoffs, it doesnt mean anything unless he performs poorly.  Rodgers has only peformed poorly in 2/11 playoff games. He is a great playoff qb and one of the 2 highest rated ever (at least 10 games played).  Football is a team game. And Brady has gotten that benefit when he lost in 2007, 2010, 2011, and 2013"
Patriots,3c0a2u,KeyTBoi,2,Sat Jul 4 15:08:54 2015 UTC,"This ridiculous need to put down other QBs to prop up Brady is out of control. Rodgers played with no leg this playoffs and almost made a super bowl. And would have, if the meltdown on special teams doesn't occur. Both great QBs. Personally I'd take Brady because I agree that there seemingly is an innate ability to win. But Rodgers can drop a ball through a tire swing from 40 yards out while on the run. And Brady has thrown in multipl stinkers in the playoffs.   The 2007 chargers giants playoff games were pretty bad. 2009 was horrendous. 2010 against the jets was pathetic, regardless of the final stat line. 2011 against the Ravens was awful, then the late 3rd and 4th quarter against the Giants stunk."
Patriots,3c0a2u,TaylorSwiftIsGod,9,Sat Jul 4 01:45:04 2015 UTC,"No leg? Fuck outta here with that shit.  His defense got the ball back for 4 times in that game and he couldn't put them away.   Don't give me injuries, Brady had a bad ankle in SB42 don't hear a peep about that.   As for rodgers throwing a ball through a tire on the run, who gives a shit. Ya he's a great passer. But he isn't the greatest QB.   2007 chargers game who won? 2011 ravens game who won?  Playoffs is about winning. Rodgers really hasn't done that outside of 2010."
Patriots,3c0a2u,JustinC00,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:05:30 2015 UTC,"And the other games I mentioned where Brady was bad and they lost? I already said I'm pickin brady but you people won't even criticize and honestly evaluate him and his past games, or you throw down other great QBs with ridiculous put down attempts. So on February 1, 2015 was Rodgers better than Brady? Because Rodgers won his last in 2010-11 at that point. And Brady hadn't won since 2004-05."
Patriots,3c0a2u,TaylorSwiftIsGod,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:43:11 2015 UTC,"Rodgers is a great qb who has only had 2 poor playoff performances. (2011 against NYG, 2014 against SEA)  However, since Rodgers has been in the league, so has Brady (2009 and 2012 against Baltimore).  If you actually watched the 5 other games you mentioned you would know that Brady did not play poorly in any of them."
Patriots,3c0a2u,KeyTBoi,2,Sat Jul 4 13:01:39 2015 UTC,Played very poorly against the Jets.  Played a horrendous game against San Diego.  Played poorly in the late third Q and into the 4th Qtr of Superbowl 46.
Patriots,3c0a2u,TaylorSwiftIsGod,2,Sat Jul 4 15:48:51 2015 UTC,He did not play poorly in any of those games.  He kept them in the game against the Jets and he played well.  He was 7 for 7 in the 4th quarter against San Diego and put the Patriots up 21-12 with the game sealing TD. He also had two TDs. And lead the team to 21 points. Maroney had a 1 yard rush TD that could have very easily been a throw by Tom. Are you going to say the 2013 game against the Colts was a mediocre performance now too?  Brady lead the team to each of their 21 points and ate up a a significant number of clock during his time of possesion in the 4th quarter. He closed the game beautifully.  He broke Super Bowl records in Super Bowl 46 and played poorly against the Giants in the 4th and late 3rd because Justin Tuck busted his shoulder.  It was one of the 5-6 greatest performances by a Super Bowl losing qb in history.  Im going to assume you didnt watch these games. Otherwise you would know all this.
Patriots,3c0a2u,KeyTBoi,-1,Sat Jul 4 15:58:24 2015 UTC,Yes he did. You're whitewashing critical interceptions.

If Brady say plays 1 or 2, I would rather have that 3rd and Jimmy if Jimmy looks good in the preseason and practice.  He already has been in the system and I could fill a need with that 3rd."

Yep..a month ago:   Published: June 4, 2015   I know some don't like it and find it ""deceitful"" but I hold strongly in the opinion that any entity wanting to use a place to promote themselves/their product(For example: The military promoting recruitment and the like) to the public should not be given a free pass to do so(honoring or not). It shouldn't matter in what form it is done in. People assuming the honoring is done free of charge are a bit naive. It costs a lot of money for the Patriots to just give out PREMIUM space for free that they could have given to somebody else. I'm sure the Patriots cut them a huge discount as is anyway and give a lot of perks to military members. I always see military members field side. Something like that would cost us peons thousands and thousands of dollars while I bet they get it for free or next to nothing."

Patriots,3c1pjc,lordmadone,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:12:08 2015 UTC,It's a bit different than a TV commercial. I think people as a whole should just fairly presume the military is paying the Patriots some kind of compensation unless otherwise stated.

Patriots,3c1pjc,MHath,4,Sat Jul 4 00:27:17 2015 UTC,"The implication was that the ""Salute to Service"" was done as a public service, akin to the whole pink October thing.  They never said they weren't being paid, but on the other hand, they certainly didn't volunteer that they were."
Patriots,3c1pjc,mechesh,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:39:10 2015 UTC,"It comes off that way, because the military wants people to think they're not paying for it.

Patriots,3c1rvm,timnog,2,Sat Jul 4 03:26:34 2015 UTC,"I got this hat autographed around 6 or 7 years ago at training camp, before I followed the team closely like I do now. I would love to be able to identify whose signature this is."
Patriots,3c1rvm,The_Hempest,4,Sat Jul 4 03:41:19 2015 UTC,"My guess would be Brandon McGowan.    I based that on the date and the fact the number looks like 30.  FYI, you can check pro-football-reference.com for all players to wear a certain number."

Patriots,3c0q3f,philipinapio1,25,Fri Jul 3 18:30:32 2015 UTC,"Same number, same build, same style, they even look similar.  Bill can keep finding as many NinkoVrabels as he wants, no problem with me."
Patriots,3c0q3f,zipperoooo,11,Fri Jul 3 19:20:35 2015 UTC,"I remember Vrabel having more length and agility than Nink, but it has been a while since I have watched Vrabel. I don't see Nink lining up at TE in the redzone and catching TD's, but he also doesn't have to with our TE group."
Patriots,3c0q3f,AmProffessy_WillHelp,7,Fri Jul 3 19:38:38 2015 UTC,"I know it probably will never happen, but can you imagine Brady to Ninko? Boner for days!"

Patriots,3c0q3f,ctpatsfan77,2,Sat Jul 4 01:52:06 2015 UTC,"Vrabel's versatility is more from one linebacker spot to another, with his height and arm length and movement you wouldn't want to waste his pass coverage ability.  Both at their best, Ninkovich probably isn't quite as good at the pass coverage.  But, right now, he's got some good pass rush.  Both inside and outside"
Patriots,3c0q3f,AmericanFartBully,4,Fri Jul 3 23:59:30 2015 UTC,"Vrabel was better, but he's cast in a similar mold to Ninks."
Patriots,3c0q3f,PlayinWithGod,2,Fri Jul 3 20:27:46 2015 UTC,Did Vrabel play DEnd much? I don't remember his hand being on the ground all that much
Patriots,3c0q3f,mcorcoran3,3,Fri Jul 3 23:18:11 2015 UTC,"Only rarely, since the Pats tended to run a 3–4 back then, in which the DEs were closer to 300# than Vrabel's 260#.

Patriots,3c0cze,bab00ngeneral,15,Sat Jul 4 10:58:45 2015 UTC,"He is technically a super bowl champion now.  So, yes, he will be referred to as 2x Super Bowl Champion Jimmy Garoppolo when he gets his second."
Patriots,3c0cze,beansisfat,9,Fri Jul 3 17:06:25 2015 UTC,"We can look to Steve Young for guidance. He is a three-time Super Bowl champion and rightfully can wear all three rings. However, when we talk about his accomplishments and merits as one of the greatest QBs of all time, only Super Bowl XXIX where he was the starter and Super Bowl MVP really should be considered. Those other two belong to Montana."
Patriots,3c0cze,Baking,7,Fri Jul 3 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you do it.  You can safely assume that every team that has won a superbowl has had a backup quarterback on its roster, but thy don't appear on any list of superbowl winning quarterbacks.  So if Brady wins 2 more with Jimmy as his backup, and Jimmy wins 4 on his own, he will have 7 rings to Brady's 6 but only 4 superbowl wins to Brady's 6, (unless Brady becomes his QB coach.)"
Patriots,3c0cze,SpecOpBeevee,11,Fri Jul 3 17:24:06 2015 UTC,"Technically yes, but any intelligent person would understand he didn't play much of a part in the first."
Patriots,3c0cze,creeeponthis,9,Fri Jul 3 17:12:59 2015 UTC,But he did! Imitating Russell and that offense for our defense is a huge part. But I understand
Patriots,3c0cze,Celltech10,7,Fri Jul 3 17:16:00 2015 UTC,you act like that isnt done by every single team in the league
Patriots,3c0cze,GGerrik,6,Fri Jul 3 18:08:26 2015 UTC,"Yet people fail to understand that practice is important, and the full 53 and the entire coaching staff really do deserve their Super Bowl rings, and nods for winning it.   Not just the ones who went out and played in the game."
Patriots,3c0cze,Celltech10,-1,Fri Jul 3 22:47:46 2015 UTC,... what. the. fuck are you talking about. i never said it wasnt a whole team effort. all i said was that Jimmy G didnt do anythign that any other backup wouldnt do or doesnt do.

Patriots,3c0cze,Celltech10,0,Fri Jul 3 22:56:43 2015 UTC,pretty close to it haha
Patriots,3c0cze,AmericanFartBully,-1,Fri Jul 3 23:19:10 2015 UTC,"But by that reasoning, Tom Brady is doing the same thing as every other QB in leading his team's first-team offense....it's just that this team won the SuperBowl."
Patriots,3c0cze,Celltech10,-1,Sat Jul 4 01:38:06 2015 UTC,"Listen man, are you an idiot? That literally is so apples and oranges I can't even handle it. That is IN NO WAY similar to the concept of Jimmy G trying to mimic the QB of an upcoming opponent"
Patriots,3c0cze,AmericanFartBully,2,Sat Jul 4 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"The thing is, it could very well be that some back-ups contribute more substantially in that particular way.  And that difference proves significant in the team finishing where or how it does.  Just like more experienced back-ups quarterbacks help out in the meetings and analyzing film.  From a certain distance, they're just holding clip-boards, but each individual adds exerts their own unique gravity onto the group as a whole.  Personally, I think, Garoppolo's biggest contribution could well be just being ready-enough by the start of the season that they could be sufficiently confident in holding just two QB for the regular season roster.  That must've had at least some influence on any of a number of personnel decisions throughout the season.  Now, when you factor-in that a guy like Butler makes the game-saving play...  In this salary-cap era,  the depth of the whole team, the contributions guys 35-53 (as opposed to your top 30 or so players), is that much more critical."
Patriots,3c0cze,TheMagicianDolph,-8,Sat Jul 4 07:58:02 2015 UTC,"The homerism is rampant in this sub. It's messed up people are trying to bring Peyton's ring into this, and Dan Marino too.   Having a ring like Peyton doesn't mean anything. Last time I checked he wasn't the starting QB. When he wins one on his own than you can bring it up,"

Patriots,3bwsdt,HongManChoi,30,Fri Jul 3 06:24:01 2015 UTC,So how many draft picks do the Chargers lose? If there aren't any that would kind of prove a bias against the Patriots even if Tom is guilty (of deflating the balls it turns out weren't deflated). Why is only one team penalized for it's individual players cheating?
Patriots,3bwsdt,mrprpl,2,Thu Jul 2 22:38:28 2015 UTC,"Not really, the Patriots were docked draft picks and fined because they allegedly had a role in everything. The penalties were bullshit, but I think the punishment on Brady vs Gates (rather than the Patriots vs Chargers) is a better example of bias."
Patriots,3bwsdt,littlelionel10,13,Fri Jul 3 07:23:11 2015 UTC,"Except the Wells report said the team did not have a hand in it, the report went out of its way to say there was no team involvement. So the comparison is definitely fair."

Patriots,3bwsdt,littlelionel10,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:53:02 2015 UTC,"I got the idea from the full letter from the league to the Patriots, it's a pretty sickening read:   “In accepting the findings of the report, we note that the report identified no evidence of wrongdoing or knowledge of wrongdoing on the part of any member of the coaching staff, including Head Coach Bill Belichick, or by any Patriots’ staff member other than Mr. Jastremski and Mr. McNally, including head equipment manager Dave Schoenfeld. Similarly, the Wells report is clear that Patriots ownership and executives did not participate in any way in the misconduct, or have knowledge of the misconduct.   Nonetheless, it remains a fundamental principle that the club is responsible for the actions of club employees. This principle has been applied to many prior cases. Thus, while no discipline should or will be imposed personally on any owner or executive at the Patriots, discipline is appropriately imposed on the club.”   The full thing contains even more amazing stretches of logic."
Patriots,3bwsdt,mrprpl,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:05:46 2015 UTC,"So I was right. I'm not saying that the penalties against the Pats are right or wrong.

Patriots,3bwsdt,littlelionel10,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:27:29 2015 UTC,"To me it seems way out there to say that players don't count as ""club employees"" (since the same company pays their salaries) but yes, that is apparently what the NFL is going with.

Step out of football if you need to heal. Im not a fan of draconian laws but the league is trying to smear the pats but the bolts are let off with a slap. Antonio is not a qb and can be replaced.

Patriots,3bwsdt,deadkactus,19,Fri Jul 3 04:00:19 2015 UTC,"Lots of players use PEDs I reckon, including Patriots. Sucks to see Gates get caught, doesn't ruin my respect for him just like Deflategate doesn't ruin the Patriots / Brady's career for me."
Patriots,3bwsdt,abmmm,3,Fri Jul 3 00:17:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised at all if most/all teams had organization support for PEDs where someone employeed by the team helps them get pharmaceutical grade PEDs, not the random shit from China that gym bros use. It's not like these young football players know about the latest PEDs or know where to get them, but all of them are ridiculously huge, far bigger than athletes used to be in the past. But we are not going to get a multi-million dollar investigation into it. Along with concussions, this is probably one of the big secrets that the NFL likes to keep in the closet."
Patriots,3bwsdt,alisonstone,2,Fri Jul 3 05:55:06 2015 UTC,"I think this is happening, the NFL will never exist without PEDs, I think they should be legalized to facilitate safe use amongst players who wish to take them.

Patriots,3bwsdt,RedditName12,3,Fri Jul 3 10:46:11 2015 UTC,"If PEDs are legalized and there is more research into it, we can actually get some pretty big medical breakthroughs. There is a lot of talk about how growth hormones and other types of PEDs can improve the lives of the elderly or people who have suffered pretty serious injuries, but the research into those drugs are not at the level where doctors are comfortable in administering it to patients. For these people, it's not about an unfair playing field, but being able to walk again. Legalizing PEDs in sports would actually advance medicine in this area at lightning speed.  It's kinda like stem cell usage. All the pro-athletes who get injured get stem cell treatment overseas where it is legal. That is why everybody is coming back from ACL injuries and Achilles tears now. It sucks that it is illegal in the U.S. A lot of non-athletes can benefit from that technology."

Patriots,3bwsdt,doodeecheng5,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:06:33 2015 UTC,"God these dumb comparisons need to stop. PEDs are completely unrelated to discipline. Yes, the deflation bullshit is completely erroneous on almost all accounts but this is standard procedure for PEDs."
Patriots,3bwsdt,lordmadone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:57:28 2015 UTC,Now? This PED rule has been around for years. And wanting a lower PSI vs potentially colluding to he below the rule is a huge difference.
Patriots,3bwsdt,j2thek47,-15,Fri Jul 3 04:21:33 2015 UTC,Predetermined penalty. Not the same thing.
Patriots,3bwsdt,knoblauch,24,Thu Jul 2 20:42:55 2015 UTC,The predetermined penalty for an equipment infraction is $25K fine. The important thing is you tried.
Patriots,3bwsdt,PassionVoid,-12,Thu Jul 2 21:48:58 2015 UTC,"Nope that's the minimum amount they can hand down, don't be snarky all it does is make the sub worse."
Patriots,3bwsdt,bigsten15,11,Thu Jul 2 22:49:37 2015 UTC,"That's like saying that the minimum fine for a speeding ticket is $100, but they decided to repossess your house and sacrifice your first born instead. I know it's a minimum. It doesn't make the actual penalty any less ridiculous. Don't be so pedantic, all it does is make this entire website worse."
Patriots,3bwsdt,PassionVoid,-2,Thu Jul 2 22:58:59 2015 UTC,I'm not saying the penalty isn't ridiculous but it's a completely different situation. This shit is just petty and makes everyone look bad on the sub.
Patriots,3bwsdt,bigsten15,7,Thu Jul 2 23:19:20 2015 UTC,What is petty? Pointing out the prescribed penalty from the rulebook?
Patriots,3bwsdt,sugar_free_haribo,-1,Fri Jul 3 04:14:12 2015 UTC,"No, it's petty because every disciplinary action doesn't need to be compared to deflategate and how absurd the punishment is."
Patriots,3bwsdt,bigsten15,5,Fri Jul 3 05:07:45 2015 UTC,"Not every disciplinary action does, but considering these are among the first such actions since deflategate became a story and that there hasn't even been a resolution to deflategate yet, I think it's entirely fair. Also appropriate given how strident some Chargers flairs have been throughout this process."

Patriots,3bwsdt,TlMBO,-18,Fri Jul 3 05:47:48 2015 UTC,"PEDs are now equivalent to wanting a football at lower PSI range.   ...Kinda, yeah."
Patriots,3bwsdt,ohsnapitsjf,0,Thu Jul 2 20:30:35 2015 UTC,Right so following the rules is the same as using illegal drugs.  We'll be sending police by your house to arrest you based on your own logic.

Whatever the Patriots employees were doing with the footballs, regardless of whether it was against any specific rules, was not exactly ""following"" them, either. And I don't think the PEDs are ""illegal"", they're just against similarly vague and misguided league rules.   The two infractions also made approximately the same amount of competitive difference in the action on the field, I.E. None.  If irrational fans like you (and the other ~17 of you as of this post) want to bury me for not being indignant about this thing that impacts my hometown team exactly 0%, have at it. But you're undermining yourselves by coming off as the whiny, entitled saps that you've built the Patriot fan reputation into over the past decade. Thanks for that."

Unless you're Jim McNally, you know what happened as factually as I do.   I hardly even said anything that could be construed as attempting logic with you. I believe that Patriots employees' wrongdoing is slightly greater than the absolute zero you kids trumpet. I also believe there are a dozen fucking infractions of the rules per team per game, and it's up to the media to decide which one is a fun story to play up, and up to the commissioner to be fucking Vince McMahon. It's not fair, but it's silly shit to defend as though Tom Brady is being thrown into a gas chamber.   It's all a game."

Patriots,3bwsdt,kuntslayer,10,Thu Jul 2 20:54:56 2015 UTC,wanting balls in a lower PSI range is not the same as illegal PSI range

Patriots,3bvp3o,TheMagicianDolph,6,Thu Jul 2 18:34:26 2015 UTC,The throw? He had him open but hesitated and threw it late and off target.
Patriots,3bvp3o,lordmadone,2,Thu Jul 2 19:45:52 2015 UTC,Don't know why this comment is even controversial(I think I know why) but Brady even admitted it was a bad throw.
Patriots,3bvp3o,aaronorlowski10,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:58:19 2015 UTC,He hesitated because of the middle linebacker dropping back into coverage. No pump fake and this is a pick
Patriots,3bvp3o,hampsted,34,Mon Jul 6 22:37:22 2015 UTC,Most receivers can't make that catch with their dominant-arm. This tight end made it with his off-arm. The dude is unreal.

Patriots,3bvp3o,venture70,32,Tue Jul 7 16:05:52 2015 UTC,"Neat fact -- Brady called Gronk's catch the best one-handed catch he'd ever seen.  Well, some might remember Randy Moss's ""Revis catch""  When Randy Moss interviewed Brady he asked Brady about it."
Patriots,3bvp3o,wtfdizzy,18,Thu Jul 2 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"That was a good interview between Moss and Brady. I've always been a fan of Moss, even before he came to New England."
Patriots,3bvp3o,venture70,14,Thu Jul 2 18:50:18 2015 UTC,Agreed.  You can tell how much Moss respects and admires Tom Brady.
Patriots,3bvp3o,bigsten15,11,Thu Jul 2 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"He's always been open about how much he liked NE. He talks very highly about his time here, the coaching staff and Brady. I think he regrets how things ended."
Patriots,3bvp3o,MrWigglesworth2,18,Thu Jul 2 21:03:00 2015 UTC,Moss is like the athletics version of that kid who fails algebra class because they already know how to do calculus and are bored.

He beat people without breaking a sweat."
Patriots,3bvp3o,SupportstheOP,4,Fri Jul 3 02:53:42 2015 UTC,"There are 3 types of passes: one where only your reciever can get it, one where the reciever would have to try and fight for it/move to get it, and one where only Randy Moss could get it.

Patriots,3bvp3o,Jimmbo6,4,Thu Jul 2 19:48:58 2015 UTC,I totally agree. Or at minimum just as good.
Patriots,3bvp3o,GBBL,3,Fri Jul 3 05:18:43 2015 UTC,"I agree, because it was his off arm and he was triple coverered"
Patriots,3bvp3o,Bojangles1987,2,Fri Jul 3 14:14:25 2015 UTC,I can't go that far. Odell was stopped in place and grabbed it with a couple fingers. He bent his spine in a way a human spine shouldn't.
Patriots,3bvp3o,oG_Swank,2,Fri Jul 3 20:31:44 2015 UTC,Odell's catch was amazing don't get me wrong but to catch a ball with your non dominant hand while your body is turning in the opposite direction while triple teamed is something else

Gronk was fully extended, similar to OBJ's catch, but the defender turns him back inwards to a more natural position. OBJ's looks a little more cool because he is catching a rainbow trajectory pass, but Gronk catching Brady's straight line laser trajectory pass thrown a bit behind him is not easy."
Patriots,3bvp3o,ufcfan4893,3,Thu Jul 2 18:48:35 2015 UTC,Bibi jones was his best catch. That weekend at least.

Patriots,3bwdgw,Bigbohn,-4,Thu Jul 2 19:06:31 2015 UTC,why do you not care if people cheat?
Patriots,3bwdgw,Realik,3,Fri Jul 3 00:28:14 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if you're asking me if I care, or if you're asking me why I don't care."
Patriots,3bwdgw,Bigbohn,-3,Fri Jul 3 00:32:33 2015 UTC,Why would you not care
Patriots,3bwdgw,Realik,8,Fri Jul 3 00:41:32 2015 UTC,"For a multitude of reasons.  1.) There are tons of different supplements that athletes use to help increase their performance that aren't on the banned substances list, I don't see why the most effective ones should be banned if the player is willing to risk the sides effects, it's his body, that's his choice to make.  2.) Football players often leave college with no real backup plan besides the NFL. PEDs can be the difference between making it on a team, and living a life of poverty. Player's are also payed based on their performance, and careers can be cut short at any time by injury. PEDs could be a difference of many millions of dollars in their career. If I was in either situation, I'm taking the PEDs 9 times out of 10, and I think any other person whose being honest with themselves would do the same.  3.) PEDs make players bigger, faster and stronger. They also allow athletes to recover from injuries faster. By having more athletic players, who are out of the lineup for less time you are increasing entertainment value and therefore putting out a better product on the field. You can even argue that the steroids were a huge boon to the sport of baseball, as they fueled the Mark Macguire Sammy Sosa home run race.  4.) I don't actually consider any of these things cheating. Deflating footballs, spying, equipment tampering etc. have almost no effect on the game, IMO, and I think so many players are using PEDs that the field is essentially even. The only things I would consider cheating would be something along the lines of poisoning the opposing teams water jugs, or some Buffalo Wild Wings commercial kinda shit.  5.) I believe that every team bends or breaks the rules every game. If every team is trying to get illegal advantages, then no team is actually gaining an advantage.  6.) Life isn't a movie, and the NFL isn't field of dreams. We aren't watching a field good happy story, we're watching fully grown, physical phenoms throttle each other for chances at contracts worth tens of millions of dollars. Sportsmanship goes out the window when that kind of money is on the line.  7.) Hyper competitive people will often break rules if it results in winning. Those are the kinds of people that fill up the ranks of professional sports, it's the nature of the game.  8.) Professional sports all have long histories of cheating. Gaylord Perry was a known spit baller, but is still in the hall of fame. It's only recently that everyone decides to get all morally outraged at it, when in reality cheating in a game isn't a big deal.  9.) ""You ain't cheating, you ain't trying."" To me, there's actually something admiral about being willing to break the rules in order to win. It shows that someone truly has that competitive fire, that they're willing to risk it all to be the best, and I think that's awesome.  10.) No matter how much of an ""advantage"" any of this crap gives you, you still have to do the work. Deflated footballs don't throw themselves, spy cameras don't make gameplans, and steroids don't lift weights. And none of those things can read a play from on the field, jump a route, or have football instincts.  I could keep going, but 10 seems like a good place to stop."

Patriots,3bwdgw,Kevin_Jim,-7,Thu Jul 2 18:38:29 2015 UTC,"Look, we all know the TB12 game suspensions are bogus and a severe knee jerk reaction to false accusations and scientific misconduct.  That being said, if the NFL believes that the infraction happened on field and hurts the 'integrity of the sport' then they should have every right to punish the parties the same or even more heavily then conduct committed off the field.  That doesn't make the penalties fair or justified, not by a long shot.  But we don't live in a fair or just world. If we did, the Pats would've received a warning about ball inflation standards and the NFL would have a more tolerant policy on marijuana use."
Patriots,3bwdgw,Avien,6,Thu Jul 2 19:51:53 2015 UTC,"If ""integrity of the sport"" is what they care about then Goodell should resign.  He's done more to harm the integrity of the game than Tom Brady ever could."

Patriots,3bvto3,mikerotch0,12,Thu Jul 2 15:48:37 2015 UTC,"Reiss stepped out of his usually reserved role this past Spring and really showed what he's capable of as a sports writer. For anyone who thinks it's his job to side with the Patriots, I'd point you to Rich Cimini who is Reiss' counterpart with the Jets who never had a problem (and deservedly so) dumping on the Jets all throughout the Buttfumble/Tebow/Foot fetish years. Reiss, because of his role with ESPN Boston, had the burden of knowing where he needed to stand on Deflategate since all eyes would be on him. Unlike so many of his peers, it was clear that he did his research before speaking. I'd agree with another poster in this thread that it's important not to get too enamored with a single reporter. Reiss is nailing it though and I back this thread."
Patriots,3bvto3,BURNEDandDIED,31,Thu Jul 2 17:48:15 2015 UTC,It's not a good idea for a fan base to fawn over a particular reporter too much.  The natural tendency for them is to then start questioning if they're too biased in your direction and then the tendency is to WAY over-correct.
Patriots,3bvto3,toakleaf,36,Thu Jul 2 16:15:49 2015 UTC,Yeah... Mike Reiss Sucks  Mike Reiss Sucks!

Patriots,3bvto3,toakleaf,15,Thu Jul 2 16:49:51 2015 UTC,"R/patriots is not going to affect Mike Reiss or his writing in any way whatsoever. People like him because he's responsible, he's pretty sunny  on the patriots, he publicly owns up to mistakes, and he's very consistent with his beliefs on issues.   The love here is very strong for him and it's threatening to become a circle-jerk, but the guy really has earned it.

Patriots,3bvto3,toakleaf,2,Thu Jul 2 16:48:46 2015 UTC,Are you saying that to receive a compliments means that one will probably have to start doubting one's perceptions and work performance? That seems like a stretch or a projection to me.
Patriots,3bvto3,FeelingsDetective,2,Thu Jul 2 20:07:48 2015 UTC,"It's that Reiss is a journalist and has to constantly doubt and examine his own feelings if he wants to be good at the job. When you're working against human nature, you have to be especially cognizant of yourself."
Patriots,3bvto3,UhMrThePlague,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:47:41 2015 UTC,"I don't necessarily disagree with you but it really depends on the writer. Professional writers, especially popular ones hear criticism and praise from many sources--fans, fellow writers, editors, friends. Many times, it's other writers that professionals gauge themselves by whether or not their fans praise them for their integrity. It's quite possible that the praise from people who say ""we really like your fair reporting"" will only compel him to seek more fairness and continue his ongoing professional development. Many writers have ""fans"", and yes, many writers react to those fans in their work, which can suffer. But I've been reading Reiss since his early Globe days, and the only difference I see in his coverage is that he's a bit more critical of himself in the open. So again, I don't necessarily disagree with the overall thought, I just think that maybe you're painting with too broad a brush here. Maybe ""possibly affect his perception"" instead of ""likely affect his perception"" would be a better idea, because for you to write ""likely"" requires a mental leap that I don't think any of us can make. At least I can't because I don't know Reiss personally and I've never discussed his writing with him. The only thing I have to go on is his history, and I've never seen him waver."
Patriots,3bvto3,boombatta,2,Fri Jul 3 01:01:24 2015 UTC,"I think he's getting as much praise from us as he is getting flak from every state outside of New England (if not more from them) so he probably feels his coverage is reasonable and balanced.  Also, I was a reporter for two years, people lauding you for coverage on a particular topic, no matter what it's about, doesn't really affect us that much. I never believed in giving equal air time to crazy or factually inaccurate points of view as if every lunatic opinion is as valid as the truth, but when covering something controversial where both sides had solid arguments and the solution was a grey area, I always talked to both sides and included quotes and the positions of each group. This often led to both sides calling me and thanking me for ""outstanding coverage"" of whatever issue they were arguing over. I never felt compelled to side with one of these factions because of a call or thank you note.  Other times, if someone had taken a crazy/factually inaccurate position I'd quote them exactly from the interview and then list a litany of evidence provided by experts/the town/independent entities and sometimes my own research that disproved them. They'd then call me later, angry, asking who was ""paying me off"" which was funny because as a small town reporter I made $10 per hour. Other times someone had an accurate position and another party was in the wrong, which I'd show in my story, in which case they'd call and ask for ""more coverage"" and state things like ""I can always trust you for good press!"" This still didn't sway my work, I was simply looking to recount the events, show some of the arguments/opinions and then point to the factually accurate version/proposal/conclusion for cases where one was evident.  Reiss appears to work like that, I doubt any thank yous would flip him the other way."
Patriots,3bvto3,Blacksheep01,2,Thu Jul 2 17:01:53 2015 UTC,"agreed. If I were Reiss I would be like ""Why do all the most militants fans from one fan base love me so much?"" It can't possibly be because we NE fans happen to me the best media critics by chance"

Part of that is her role as a columnist, but Reiss doesn't even broach some of her best points, if only because she is so good.   Plus, Jenkins has more credibility because she isn't a Patriots reporter. Again, I like Reiss, but Jenkins is the MVP on deflategate reporting."

Patriots,3bvto3,ihateconnecticut,2,Thu Jul 2 23:48:07 2015 UTC,"Mike Reiss is my hero. I've been following him for years, since before he went to ESPN. Honestly, I could never have been so intimately knowledgable about the Pats without his work. He's seriously enhanced my love for the Pats, and I'm forever indebted to him. He's also the most decent dude in sports journalism. Mike Reiss is the Tom Brady of journalists. GOAT!"
Patriots,3bvto3,batmanzc,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:17:57 2015 UTC,I love how he posts which players are getting the most media attention in the locker room. It kinda feels good to know when non-top level guys are getting some love.
Patriots,3bvto3,peanutbuttersucks,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:52:34 2015 UTC,Yah I'm a big fan of Mike and a large part of that is he seems very aware of himself in his reporting.  He owns up to stuff when he gets it wrong (Predicting Greg Salsa would get 60 something catches) and doesn't toot his own horn when he makes a good prediction.  Also he doesn't feel the need to take a negative angle just to seem objective (something I feel to many reporters do in general).  I partly want him to move to national media just because I think ESPN could use someone like him on league wide stuff.  I don't want this to happen though because he is so good on the pats beat.

If he starts reporting ahit the team doesn't like, he won't get anymore info from his sources in the organization. Ao as long as he wants to keep growing his career he's going to be biased. That being said he is typically level headed. A lot of Boston writers were also way too Patriot biased with things like claiming the Volts were responsible and that TB was going to be completely exonerated because of the Wells Report before it came out, etc."

Patriots,3by62h,gl00mybear,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:37:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much you're willing to spend versus risk you're willing to take. A spot on the season ticket wait list gets you access to the early sales and other deals, but it's $100 minimum (a deposit for the number of seats you'll eventually get). You're not limited to one seat on the ticket exchange or the presales if you're only in for o e seat, though. The thing is you still need to be Johnny on the spot to get anything decent on those presales, or watch the ticket exchange like a hawk.  The other option is the secondary market. Stubhub will have a thousand tickets for sale the second the presale goes live. It's honestly infuriating sitting at your computer, refreshing your browser constantly from 9:55, seeing only last row tickets available , and then heading over to stubhub and seeing a thousand tickets on sale with $50 markup on each at 10:01. I don't know how they got such a corner on the market, but most fans are basically at the scalpers mercy."

Patriots,3bswow,itsNOSAJ,12,Thu Jul 2 02:39:28 2015 UTC,I never noticed how loose the ball was. Hightower almost fucked us over
Patriots,3bswow,ward0630,17,Thu Jul 2 01:49:10 2015 UTC,I thought Hightower pushed him down because he was afraid Butler would fumble it.
Patriots,3bswow,pr3167,4,Thu Jul 2 02:08:05 2015 UTC,Pushed him out of the endzone so they wouldn't get a safety
Patriots,3bswow,PassionVoid,4,Thu Jul 2 12:29:57 2015 UTC,"What? No. He pushed him down so he wouldn't keep running and risk a fumble. Butler was already out of the endzone at that point, and even if he wasn't, it would've been a touchback. Unless you have complete possession outside of the endzone, and return to the endzone on your own volition, and not due to the momentum of making the play or being pushed/pulled back by an opponent, it's not a safety. If it's due to momentum, it's a touchback. If an opponent brings you there, forward progress keeps you out. Who is upvoting this? Do people here seriously not know the rules?"
Patriots,3bswow,ward0630,0,Fri Jul 3 01:21:16 2015 UTC,"It's reversed for defensive plays, actually. If you intercept the ball and down it in the endzone (as Devin McCourty (Actually it was Harmon) did in the last few minutes of the divisional game against the Ravens), it's a touchback, and the ball is placed at the twenty.   Butler's problem was that he intercepted that pass right at the goal line, so he didn't have a good chance to take a knee in the endzone, hence why he brought it out, and the looseness of the ball is why Hightower pushed him down at the 2 yard line."
Patriots,3bswow,quinsy42,6,Thu Jul 2 13:20:20 2015 UTC,Harmon actually intercepted the ball at the endzone the last few minutes of the Ravens divisional game. McCourty got a pick earlier in he game though...
Patriots,3bswow,ward0630,2,Thu Jul 2 14:56:24 2015 UTC,I stand corrected.
Patriots,3bswow,pr3167,3,Thu Jul 2 15:54:37 2015 UTC,"It's reversed for defensive plays, actually. If you intercept the ball and down it in the endzone (as Devin McCourty did in the last few minutes of the divisional game against the Ravens), it's a touchback, and the ball is placed at the twenty. But maybe it was the looseness of the ball, who knows   If you gain possession of the ball in the endzone (with either a pick or fumble), run out of the endzone, then run back and get tackled in the endzone it's a safety. I didn't review the video or anything when I read those comments that Hightower pushed him down, but I just assumed it was to prevent a safety based on the few years I played football (it's what I would have done in the same situation)."
Patriots,3bswow,mastererrl,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:47:56 2015 UTC,"I think it was honestly Hightower just thinking ""holy shit you picked it off, get the fuck down and don't do anything"" because some players instantly try to take off. Didn't look like he was gonna try and do that, but still."
Patriots,3bswow,djimbob,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:10:33 2015 UTC,"Granted it is all about the impetus.  E.g., if a player intercepts out of the end zone, but has momentum or is tackled to go back into the end zone, it is not a safety or a touchback -- the intercepting team gets the ball back at the spot of the interception (sort of similar to forward progress) and the rules specifically explain this situation.  For an interception it is hard to get a safety.  You'd have to get the ball outside the end zone, then of your own volition choose to run back into the end zone and then get downed in the end zone.  From the rulebook:   The important factor in a safety is impetus. Two points are scored for the opposing team when the ball is dead on or behind a team’s own goal line if the impetus came from a player on that team.  [...]  Examples of Non-Safety:   (a) Player intercepts a pass with both feet inbounds in the field of play and his momentum carries him into his own end zone. Ball is put in play at spot of interception.  (b) Player intercepts a pass in his own end zone and is downed in the end zone, even after recovering in the end zone. Impetus came from passing team, not from defense. (Touchback)"

Patriots,3bswow,Montaron87,2,Thu Jul 2 05:19:04 2015 UTC,That'd be cool if they re-released them on BluRay. I think my dad already has the first three.
Patriots,3bswow,djjazzzytiff,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:21:57 2015 UTC,"One thing I've always wondered about, because I'm not 100% clear on the rules, but had he taken the knee inside the endzone instead of falling forward and going down at the 1 yard line, would they have snapped the ball at the 20 yard line?"
Patriots,3bswow,Hylian_Spud,2,Thu Jul 2 09:44:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, interception ruled down in the endzone is a touchback."
Patriots,3bswow,fixyouregrammar,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:11:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks. So he didn't just win us the game, but he made it more exciting while doing so."
Patriots,3bswow,shaq_daddy,2,Thu Jul 2 13:28:01 2015 UTC,"It's iffy though. It looks like when he intercepts the ball he is outside of the endzone, then bounces off the receiver back into the endzone. Which is why Hightower pushed him forward."

Patriots,3bu3bj,ColainaCup,17,Thu Jul 2 04:02:33 2015 UTC,"A lot of players have come and gone, and seeing old pictures of them usually elicits happy memories.   Seeing these two on the field, however, makes me feel a little sad as in something is missing. And then a thought crossed my mind that one day we'll be looking at a picture of TB and BB like this after one (or both) have departed. Depressing, scary, and sad."
Patriots,3bu3bj,MessyHair66,7,Thu Jul 2 11:57:11 2015 UTC,"It is, but at least we've made a lot of great memories over the years. Even if the team is bad we'll always be able to remember the glory days.  I have faith that as long as Kraft or another good owner is in charge of the team, that the Patriots will still be a very succesful franchise."
Patriots,3bu3bj,Hylian_Spud,3,Thu Jul 2 13:14:44 2015 UTC,How much longer does kraft have?
Patriots,3bu3bj,Patriots4life89,6,Thu Jul 2 13:48:15 2015 UTC,"His son should take over, and hopefully he has learned from Robert and understands what it takes to be the best owner in the NFL."
Patriots,3bu3bj,fixyouregrammar,2,Thu Jul 2 13:51:13 2015 UTC,"That would be my thought as well. Bob Kraft is 74 too, it's not like he's about to drop dead or anything. It seems like he could probably do another ten years or so, who knows."
Patriots,3bu3bj,Hylian_Spud,3,Thu Jul 2 14:04:57 2015 UTC,"I love kraft and I think he's one of the best. But I must say, I think he has learned a lot from BB these last 15 years, and I think BB has taken a lot of weight off of krafts shoulders"
Patriots,3bu3bj,Patriots4life89,4,Thu Jul 2 19:03:12 2015 UTC,"Probably so. But we have a ""culture of winning"" now, and I'm hoping that the organization won't completely fall apart after BB leaves."
Patriots,3bu3bj,Hylian_Spud,8,Thu Jul 2 19:16:46 2015 UTC,"I've been a Pats fan since 1996 when I got a Drew Bledsoe jersey for my 10th birthday.  I have seen many players that I've loved come and go, but I am hard pressed to believe that I will ever love any players more than Tom and Vince."
Patriots,3bu3bj,fixyouregrammar,4,Thu Jul 2 13:50:17 2015 UTC,"Ultimately it's for the best, but I'm gonna miss big Vince next season. Hope he tears it up with the Texans."

Patriots,3btmp0,Jericcho,10,Thu Jul 2 01:25:43 2015 UTC,Means Gronk and Brady are top 10.  Knew Brady obviously was going to be but thought Gronk may have been voted 11-20. Hopefully McCourty and are linebackers can get in next year.
Patriots,3btmp0,qickduiggley,6,Thu Jul 2 04:46:49 2015 UTC,"I I haven't been following... Collins, Hightower and McCourty missed? What? You'd think there would be SB bias as well.."

Patriots,3btmp0,zipperoooo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:00:27 2015 UTC,Yah I know the list is really flawed and means nothing but it always surprises me how few Patriots make it every year.  (Prob says a lot about how they are viewed as BB and TB's team by most)
Patriots,3btmp0,Mojoran,10,Fri Jul 3 02:16:25 2015 UTC,"Mad respect for Revis, but lets not forget who the didnt mention in this video. Mr Nelson"
Patriots,3btmp0,dd2811,7,Thu Jul 2 05:58:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, one of the rare times Revis got beat throughout the year"
Patriots,3btmp0,fixyouregrammar,6,Thu Jul 2 06:58:59 2015 UTC,"that was just a friendly ribbing, I really only think he kinda got beat because he was playing outside technique to protect the sideline and his interior guys got caught with their pants down"
Patriots,3btmp0,mastererrl,6,Thu Jul 2 07:27:32 2015 UTC,"Jordy just played it perfect, as he usually does."
Patriots,3btmp0,I_Need_Cowbell,3,Thu Jul 2 13:43:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, he got beat and that's the only way to put it. You can't let a guy be ""the best shutdown CB"" and then when he plays a different tech give him an excuse. He gave up a key TD because Nelson beat him."
Patriots,3btmp0,hashbrown17,3,Thu Jul 2 15:03:45 2015 UTC,McCourty was REALLY far over too
Patriots,3btmp0,fresh2deafbill,0,Thu Jul 2 17:26:19 2015 UTC,I didn't think there was any but some might say Nelson pushed off before his break. Point being that if Revis does manage to get beaten it's probably by an excellent play with a bit of luck ;)
Patriots,3btmp0,dank-nuggetz,3,Thu Jul 2 11:28:12 2015 UTC,I think that play was honestly more on McCourty...but that opinion will probably get me killed here.
Patriots,3btmp0,TheMagicianDolph,28,Thu Jul 2 15:25:50 2015 UTC,"Can't believe he's below Sherman. It's weird because this list is made from player input, and I have a hard time believing the average NFL player thinks Sherman is better. No disrespect to Sherm, but after having the pleasure of watching Revis play 19 games this season, I can safely say he's the best in the business."
Patriots,3btmp0,Johannes_silentio,3,Thu Jul 2 01:51:24 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. There was no one that could have been better, especially in our system, than Revis, regardless of the price tag.   I did, however, find it a bit intriguing that his personality to stay quiet and just do his job makes him almost polar opposite to Sherman's loud, flamboyant personality. In a sense, they are like two sides of the same coin. They are definitely equals, unfortunately that is not something we can document in a video like this."
Patriots,3btmp0,phil_ratio69,5,Thu Jul 2 02:16:04 2015 UTC,You're a homer. Just cause he played with the Pats doesn't means he's the best.
Patriots,3btmp0,fixyouregrammar,22,Thu Jul 2 04:14:26 2015 UTC,"100% agree on the homerism critique. And now that Revis is with the Jets, he's fucking terrible."
Patriots,3btmp0,broner4brady,2,Thu Jul 2 06:17:32 2015 UTC,Fucking terrible!!
Patriots,3btmp0,obscuremainstream,3,Fri Jul 3 02:00:23 2015 UTC,Revis is better than Sherman.
Patriots,3btmp0,obscuremainstream,4,Thu Jul 2 13:43:35 2015 UTC,"While I do think Revis is a great corner he is not the best CB in the league. Last year in the playoffs he gave up 3 tds, was called for a costly penalty negating a strip sack in the Ravens game. His blown coverage on Nelson in the end of the first half of the Packers game was the difference between winning and losing that game in my mind. He was great last year but Sherman is more of a game changer."
Patriots,3btmp0,trog12,7,Thu Jul 2 03:38:54 2015 UTC,"That one TD was bullshit in the superbowl the ref completely screened him. That was literally the only catch he gave up all game, vs Revis the Seattle WRs had one catch for 3 yards."

Patriots,3btmp0,Ferrrrrrrrrrrrrrrari,2,Thu Jul 2 17:52:30 2015 UTC,But the penalty was a blown call
Patriots,3btmp0,Jagged03,7,Thu Jul 2 04:31:01 2015 UTC,"There was a questionable PI against him early in the game but the holding penalty that negated the strip sack was very blatant tug on Steve Smith's shoulder when Steve got the better of him, that was a bad play by Revis"

Patriots,3btmp0,-TG-,3,Thu Jul 2 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"How is Patrick Peterson so high? Most overrated player in the NFL, for sure."
Patriots,3btmp0,-Rattata-,2,Thu Jul 2 16:05:14 2015 UTC,17 feels low to me - maybe Revis didn't have the flashiest of numbers but watching him play told a very different story. Shutting down every #1 receiver thrown at him....   The comparison to Sherman is stupid imo - they have entirely different roles. FWIW - I think Revis had a significantly harder job than Sherman last year.
Patriots,3btmp0,-TG-,3,Thu Jul 2 13:49:19 2015 UTC,Sherman has without a doubt put up better numbers but has the benefit of the LOB.
Patriots,3btmp0,SpecOpBeevee,3,Thu Jul 2 03:16:14 2015 UTC,Sherman is better at playing the ball so he gets more INTs if that's what you mean?  They both do tight coverage but only one of them sticks with the #1 every play
Patriots,3btmp0,Skippertech,3,Thu Jul 2 03:22:36 2015 UTC,"I like looking at opposing QB passer rating to rate a corner's effectiveness.  I know Sherman sticks to his side but its not like Revis was shadowing the best receiver every play for every game. He wasn't on Megatron very often in the Lions game.   Anyways I'm just playing devils advocate. Week to week Revis' job was harder last year, and he didn't have two all pro safeties behind him."
Patriots,3btmp0,JozefT,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:26:02 2015 UTC,"Revis is the best because he can cover any #1 receiver, Sherman sticks to his side."
Patriots,3btmp0,mavedisian,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:02:50 2015 UTC,"With Sherman it kinda seems like quarterbacks are more likely to throw at him, with Revis he dosen't really get tested a lot.. it gives Sherman more opportunity to make plays"
Patriots,3brcyn,itsNOSAJ,69,Wed Jul 1 15:08:58 2015 UTC,"This is the play where I feel like the Pat's broke Manning's will.   I like to think this play ruined the Broncos season. Probably not, but I like to think it did."

Patriots,3brcyn,chubswerve,6,Wed Jul 1 16:08:16 2015 UTC,"He was good, and incredible for the price, but I feel like that sack was a function of the playcall more than of Ayers.  Definitely happy to pick up his (SB-inflated) comp value from the Rams."
Patriots,3brcyn,EByrne,2,Wed Jul 1 16:32:13 2015 UTC,"I agree, I'm gonna miss him because of sacks like this but most of his sacks came from busting threw a massive whole that the line makes for him."

Patriots,3brcyn,mk72206,3,Wed Jul 1 15:28:43 2015 UTC,Wilfork could tip the scale  :-)
Patriots,3brcyn,lordmadone,13,Wed Jul 1 17:55:24 2015 UTC,I was shocked there was no flag thrown on that.
Patriots,3brcyn,PatricksPub,14,Wed Jul 1 16:01:16 2015 UTC,Indeed..the replay shows a fairly low tackle and I think it was borderline. Not sure of the specific rules.
Patriots,3brcyn,edster2003,10,Wed Jul 1 16:30:02 2015 UTC,"The hit was actually the ideal target zone for tackling, his helmet hits Manning's thigh and he wraps his knees (then slides down, which is what makes it look bad). The rule states that a pass rusher who is down cannot dive for the knee or lower. Ayers was up, not down, and he targeted the thighs, which is a true form tackle if I have ever seen it."
Patriots,3brcyn,littlelionel10,19,Wed Jul 1 18:14:20 2015 UTC,"That's fair. Manning still fell awkwardly. We all cheer against Manning, but the last thing we wan't is to injure the guy."
Patriots,3brcyn,homesnatch,6,Wed Jul 1 19:05:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I would actually feel terrible if we did.  We want to beat him and his best, not take him out of the game."
Patriots,3brcyn,lordmadone,4,Wed Jul 1 20:42:35 2015 UTC,"The initial hit was above the knee, legal..  you can see that he slid below knee after initial contact.  Legal play by the books, but could have easily been called by the refs as it was so close."
Patriots,3brcyn,EByrne,2,Wed Jul 1 17:42:45 2015 UTC,Yeah..re-watched it again and it was a good no call by the refs and no fine by the league.
Patriots,3brcyn,CashIsClay1,2,Wed Jul 1 19:13:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, by rule it was a legal tackle, but I expected it to get flagged and was very surprised when it wasn't."
Patriots,3brcyn,WestCoastChowd,4,Wed Jul 1 20:45:48 2015 UTC,Wilfork's penetration had a whole lot to do with this sack.  He basically blocks the left side of the offensive line from sliding over to block Ayers.
Patriots,3brcyn,E1ger,2,Wed Jul 1 16:56:48 2015 UTC,Yup.  And this is the beautiful part of the game that the lay spectator doesn't see.  All they see are Vince's well-endowed digestive assets. ;)
Patriots,3brcyn,lordmadone,3,Thu Jul 2 03:46:42 2015 UTC,"I get a little sad saying this, but did anyone else notice the D-line stunt play improve post Pepper Johnson?   Obviously looking from the outside the organization it is hard to see the cause, whether it is simply emphasis during the week or a change up in play calling. I don't recall seeing a well executed loop stunt in 2013.  It is a thing of beauty. Though I'm left wondering who on the Dline has the Wilfork strength to push his man back enough to stop Clady coming back inside. Also Ayer's timing in waiting till Wilfork had got position is impeccable. Also on third look, WTF is the Bronco's center doing? Head on a swivel man, don't triple team a guy."
Patriots,3brcyn,CT_Real,2,Wed Jul 1 15:57:32 2015 UTC,I think the stunts were more of a necessity due to mediocre pass rush from the DTs. That and the pass coverage was really damn good so they got a bit more creative it seems.
Patriots,3brcyn,Keyann,3,Wed Jul 1 16:31:28 2015 UTC,Over the years Big Vince crashing the guard and tackle has led to quite a few stacks on the outside- in stunt.

Sure if you never heard of him before and don't know that he does the same made-up-outrage schtick for every single issue, it is entertaining the first time.   People were outraged at the NFL for Ray Rice because him punching his now-wife blew up on social media, not because of Olberman's tiresome faux-outrage commentary that he does for every issue that slightly deviates from his exact positions.  I doubt this had anything to do with ESPN trying to make nice with the NFL or other sport leagues (unlike firing Bill Simmons for calling out Goodell's lack of testicular fortitude), but everything to do with his commentary sucks."

Patriots,3bsa1i,PatricksPub,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:02:44 2015 UTC,"So this raises even more questions for me... Did Goodell actually contact espn at any point? If he did, was there some agreement about how they will depict him amidst this ridiculousness? If there was, and this case goes to court, then will Goodell have to give up all of his private communications, email, text, phone call, etc?"
Patriots,3bsa1i,Langd0n_Alger,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:30:11 2015 UTC,"Not trolling. Why does everyone here not like Olbermann's commentary? From what I've watched of his newish ESPN show he makes a lot of good points, even if he is a little arrogant. I never watched him on MSNBC, Current, or during his old days on ESPN so I don't carry any dislike or bias from any stuff he said back then. So what's the deal?"
Patriots,3bsa1i,nhmo,3,Thu Jul 2 15:34:40 2015 UTC,"He's a polemecist. His whole shtick is being outraged and morally superior, which can get very grating.

Patriots,3bynqu,ApparentlyABear,10,Fri Jul 3 17:47:56 2015 UTC,"I am against it.  I understand IAmA (and other reddit's setting up AMAs) being upset about the firing of a specific admin without a backup plan which really disrupted their activities, and the mods wanted to show their frustration.  But that's a highly unique scenario as this is the only reddit activity where everything goes through an admin to happen normally (with the admin's job to verify celebrities).  For the rest of reddit (other than the subreddits that coordinate their own IAmA), you generally don't really need much interaction with admins by design.  We also don't know the details for why she's suddenly gone; and again with these sorts of personnel changes you often can't immediately fix it.  ""Protesting""  by shutting it down on day one (or doing it in solidarity) seems premature and doesn't give anyone any time to attempt to handle the migration in a reasonable way.  And again when these sorts of issues pop up, it is on top of the day to day tasks the admins have to do (keep the site running on servers, deal with spam, ddos attacks, abuse, harassment, users/subreddits breaking rules, DCMA takedowns, coordinate with advertisers, etc).  You have a few dozen people managing a very dynamic site with millions of visitors each day and thousands of active communities."

Patriots,3brdiq,NoFriendsOnSnowday,6,Wed Jul 1 21:56:33 2015 UTC,"Same here. It's odd, when I quit drinking 20+ years ago, a certain emotional component went out of my fan-ness.  But watching the high-class management of Boston teams, especially the Pats, has invested a certain regional pride above and beyond how I feel about the Greater Boston Educational community, or the Medical community, or the range of beautiful vistas in the region.   The manufactured ""scandal"" involving the Patriots footballs was probably a set-up, and may be exposed as such. And through it all both Management and Tom Brady have conducted themselves in an exemplary fashion.  I feel more connected to the reputation of the team because I'm a native, an original fan, and I'm open-minded enough to see the truth.  IOW, I'm even psyched for preseason this year. Yup, know it's necessarily meaningless, but I just want to see some of these guys, even for a few plays.    Hang in there. Watch one of the SBs. It's a good fix for a Pats' football jones..."
Patriots,3brdiq,RankInsubordination,16,Wed Jul 1 23:43:06 2015 UTC,It was plays like these from this past year that reassured me of how much Brady still has left in the tank. He's still showing improvements from previous seasons for fuck's sake! Dude is a fucking workhorse.

Patriots,3brbgb,obscuremainstream,8,Thu Jul 2 17:36:00 2015 UTC,No one ever talks about how Peyton had hung his receivers out to dry his entire career. Austin Collie and Welker the past two seasons are just easy examples   Brady throws it in a place that protects the receiver and makes the defender unable to reach it more often than not
Patriots,3brbgb,LS_DJ,44,Fri Jul 3 02:57:51 2015 UTC,"Welker is lucky McCourty isn't a big hitter. If that's Kam or TJ McDonald, Welker's career could've ended right there. Manning should never have thrown that pass"
Patriots,3brbgb,ArDariusStewart13,26,Wed Jul 1 16:11:07 2015 UTC,"Imagine if that was Browner coming in for the hit. I dreamt of using Browner at SS for this year, just for the big hits."

Patriots,3brbgb,spongerat,11,Wed Jul 1 18:52:16 2015 UTC,He's had some damn big hits on special teams. Not saying that would actually transfer to defensive talent though.

Patriots,3brbgb,bigsten15,7,Thu Jul 2 01:23:00 2015 UTC,I think the issue is that Manning under threw him. If he put the ball in front of wes where he could catch it in stride he wouldn't have gotten smashed the way he did. But he forced Wes to slow down almost to a stop and he got turned around when he missed the catch.
Patriots,3brbgb,chubswerve,6,Wed Jul 1 17:03:55 2015 UTC,"Even if Welker caught the underthrown ball he could have cut it upfield in time to at least shield himself from hit by McCourty. By bobbling it he ended up turning the opposite way he should have and got laid out.  Manning leads a lot of his receivers into bad hits (see: Collie, Sanders) but this time I don't think it was too bad of a throw."
Patriots,3brbgb,SnackPlissken,3,Wed Jul 1 17:36:06 2015 UTC,That might've been a good thing with all the concussions Welker has gotten. Poor guy has a fried brain and still wants to play.

Patriots,3brbgb,ChillingInTraffic,42,Wed Jul 1 15:01:36 2015 UTC,Still hurts but in retrospect it worked out about as well as it could. Wes is pretty much done and Jules is the fucking man

Patriots,3brbgb,sunstersun,4,Wed Jul 1 15:47:55 2015 UTC,It wasnt even his fault he left... His agent completely over estimated his market.. and by the time they realized they made a mistake bytesting the market the pats had already signed Amendola
Patriots,3brbgb,Chick22694,7,Wed Jul 1 17:41:31 2015 UTC,Why does Peyton hate Wes so much?
Patriots,3brbgb,t3hw0lf,3,Wed Jul 1 16:50:58 2015 UTC,"It's not just Wes, he tends to put his receivers in danger a lot. Brady does his best to protect his guys and Manning doesn't seem to do the same."
Patriots,3brbgb,Bravo777,7,Thu Jul 2 05:34:03 2015 UTC,You knew pretty much as he turned around to catch it that safety help would come in to nail. Just didn't expect the spine snapper move on him.

Patriots,3brbgb,DarrelleRevis24,7,Wed Jul 1 14:58:00 2015 UTC,Why the fuck does Peyton always throw it so high to his slot receivers holy fuck it pisses me off.
Patriots,3brbgb,WestCoastChowd,3,Thu Jul 2 00:18:04 2015 UTC,"I hear what you are saying and know about Manning's history of hanging his receivers out to dry.  However, this wasn't a bad throw.  It was back-shoulder and hit Welker just under the pads.  Manning had to get it over Hightower and in between Collins on the inside and Browner on the outside.  If he had led Welker more either McCourty or even Browner might have picked it off.  A laser-beam throw would've likely hit Hightower...it would have had to have been a low back-shoulder laser, but then Collins might have had a chance to pick it off."
Patriots,3brbgb,DarrelleRevis24,0,Thu Jul 2 04:31:37 2015 UTC,"It was absolutely a bad throw, because he threw it.  You always try and throw to your slot receivers low, if you can't do that and there is a good chance they are going to get hit you just don't throw it."

Patriots,3brbgb,WestCoastChowd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:53:51 2015 UTC,It's a comment on how the sentence reads...like it's a bad throw because Manning threw it.  Not because of the fact he shouldn't have thrown it into quad coverage.

I'm not even sure this'll get read, as this post is already pretty old, but I kind of wanted to explain myself to what appears to be the source of all the hate. Thanks."

Patriots,3bpq28,SilentR0b,47,Wed Jul 1 12:57:43 2015 UTC,"It's not a participation trophy, though. 16-0 is an actual accomplishment, arguably harder to achieve than winning a Super Bowl. Bad memories yes, but also apples to oranges."

Patriots,3bpq28,wickedchowda,2,Wed Jul 1 08:21:13 2015 UTC,"It took winning in 2002 to wash the very last of the bad taste of the beat-down by the Bears in SB XX. That game was so one-sided I classified it as a ""shock to the system"" game, because of the unexpected imbalance and subsequent implosion of the team. We weren't any good for a long time after that. But here are the teams who rang 'em all up in a season. Pretty select company. No Montanas, No Elways, No Mannings, No Staubachs, No Bradshaws, No Favres, No Tarkentons.    1934 Chicago Bears season   13  0   Lost NFL Championship Game against New York Giants  13-1  1942 Chicago Bears season   11  0   Lost NFL Championship Game against Washington Redskins  11-1  1972 Miami Dolphins season  14  0   Won three playoff games including Super Bowl VII    17-0  2007 New England Patriots season    16  0     Won two playoff games before losing in Super Bowl XLII against New York Giants  If you throw that pass to identical physical specimens to the ones who participated in that SB a thousand times, you will not come close to duplicating that catch. I suspect, not being an actuary, that it would take 10,000 or more attempts before you get that result."
Patriots,3bpq28,RankInsubordination,0,Wed Jul 1 08:34:21 2015 UTC,You are right though. Needs to come down. Hard to achieve? Yes. But its still cringe worthy
Patriots,3bpq28,E1ger,2,Wed Jul 1 23:09:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's a 'reminder' of things lost.  I would think they find motivation from that banner as though it was one step, the job is still not done."
Patriots,3bpq28,wickedchowda,6,Wed Jul 1 11:23:46 2015 UTC,"I am almost positive Bill wants that banner up as a constant ""It's not over till it's over"" type motivation"
Patriots,3bpq28,mcorcoran3,2,Wed Jul 1 11:49:51 2015 UTC,"Eh, only Brady and gostkowski were on that 07 team. I think there are plenty of others ways to motivate the team than that. Some of these guys were like 14 when that happened. I can understand if people don't mind it. But to me its just a constant shitty reminder"

Patriots,3bpq28,buttsoupjets,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:57:12 2015 UTC,I don't really have a firm opinion on all this but out of curiosity: If the team went 19-0 would that have been an acceptable banner? Or just 2007 Superbowl winner's flag.
Patriots,3bpq28,mcorcoran3,2,Wed Jul 1 23:12:53 2015 UTC,I'm assuming they'd have a 16-0 banner and the Superbowl banner
Patriots,3bpq28,buttsoupjets,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:03:17 2015 UTC,"It's an amazing accomplishment but it absolutely neuters are ability to sneer at the Colt's banner without a lesson in glass houses. If they want to add a 16-0 symbol or something to the AFC championship banner (if we have those) I would be fine with that, but the 16-0 banner sort of lessens the fun of mocking the Colt's banner."
Patriots,3bpq28,lordmadone,8,Wed Jul 1 17:11:54 2015 UTC,16-0 has literally never happened and only one other team has gone undefeated during the regular season. 4 teams make it to the championship game every single year. Not to mention they got completely destroyed.
Patriots,3bpq28,keirbrow,6,Wed Jul 1 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"AFC Finalist happens ever year  16-0 has happened once ever - and it can be argued that it just recognizes a regular season accomplishment, same as if the Patriots had raised a banner for the most consecutive games won between 2003-2004"
Patriots,3bpq28,Mom-spaghetti,2,Wed Jul 1 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"I agree the accomplishment is not the same -- but it still allows for an easy retort from Colt fans. Especially since half of our fans will say (unaware of the 16 win banner) ""only super bowls should get banners."""
Patriots,3bpq28,keirbrow,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:01:56 2015 UTC,"We laugh at their banners because we hate their team for being whiny bitches, not because there is something objectively wrong with raising an AFC Finalist banner. This is about hate, not about logic.   It's like how we mock the Jets for doing things that, if the Pats did it, we wouldn't condemn nearly as harshly. It's part of football animosity."
Patriots,3bpq28,Mom-spaghetti,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:11:02 2015 UTC,I'll take it over a runner up banner. It isn't like they put up a SB runner up banner. The Patriots dominated the regular season and were undefeated. That is something to behold even if the Patriots didn't take the Lombardi home.
Patriots,3bpq28,keirbrow,-12,Thu Jul 2 17:19:12 2015 UTC,They weren't 16-0.  They were 18-1.
Patriots,3bpq28,STiReddit,4,Wed Jul 1 16:35:27 2015 UTC,"Last time I checked there are 16 games in the regular season. Anyways the banner is there for that achievement, it doesn't say shit about the Super Bowl that we all know we lost. Happy?"
Patriots,3bpq28,keirbrow,-8,Wed Jul 1 13:13:04 2015 UTC,I'll be happy when an asterisk is placed next to Brady's name in all the record books.  Should probably go for team records too.    Best team you guys ever had was with Bledsoe at the helm--last time you guys won with integrity.

Patriots,3bpq28,trowawufei,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:49:02 2015 UTC,"What did Brady do? Allegedly deflated the ball 0.4 PSI? Who made the decision that the ball had to be between 12.5 and 13.5 PSI? Why were those specifications made final? Do real fans, who've followed sports longer than you've probably been alive, actually give a shit? Nahhhh.  What did BB do? Tape practices? No. Take pictures of sideline signals? Yeah... Do real fans give a shit? Nahhhhh.  Sorry about the Cubs though. I can sympathize, my HS was awful in all sports."
Patriots,3bpq28,gagnonca,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"Except the only years Brady in any way benefited from ""cheating"" were 2014 (possibly Deflategate) and 2006 (Spygate).  If you wanna throw one game of 2007 in there for Spygate too you can, but his name in ""all the record books"" features accomplishments from outside those years. How can you not know this? Also, how can you not know that the Patriots won multiple Super Bowls in the post-Bledsoe era other than 2014? There was that whole dynasty thing after all, but being a Seahawks fan I suppose you didn't pay much attention to the NFL then. Were you even born at that point?  So really I'm not sure what I'm supposed to face. That my QB maybe benefited from violations that were about as serious as running a stop light for, at absolute most, 2 years out of a 15+ year career? Because I think that's something I've come to terms with."

Patriots,3bq7bu,mean_machinee,37,Wed Jul 1 07:27:26 2015 UTC,hurrrr durrr but such a bad call seahawks lost it pats didnt win durrrr
Patriots,3bq7bu,makethemsayayy,3,Wed Jul 1 07:37:36 2015 UTC,"Context though. If its Tom Brady throwing to Edelman with Vereen in the backfield, then yea, that's a better call. If it's Lynch with the weakest part of your offense throwing into the strongest level of the defense, then it's not a good call. Why can't it be both a bad call and a great play??? You defenders think that the play is diminished just because it's a bad call."
Patriots,3bq7bu,TaylorSwiftIsGod,18,Thu Jul 2 11:13:25 2015 UTC,The statistics point to a fumble being more likely then an interception in that situation. Add in the personal groupings they had and the Seahawks not having enough time to run it on each down and I really never got what all the controversy over the play-call was.  I wonder how much different public perception would be if Collinsworth hadn't instantly start blathering about the play-call instead of the undrafted free agent rookie who just made one of the biggest plays in Super Bowl history.
Patriots,3bq7bu,mrprpl,13,Wed Jul 1 09:25:18 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't blame Collinsworth. You hear it in every one of those reaction videos. After about 5 seconds, Seahawks fans start asking each other ""Why didn't they give it to Lynch?"" It's the obvious knee-jerk response to an interception in those circumstances. (And most football fans don't go any deeper than knee-jerk responses.)"
Patriots,3bq7bu,Plutor,10,Wed Jul 1 12:39:56 2015 UTC,I think Zolak immediately called it one of the worst playcalls in Superbowl history.
Patriots,3bq7bu,venture70,3,Wed Jul 1 14:05:17 2015 UTC,"agreed, I give all the announcers credit just for not cursing after that happened, I couldn't do it"
Patriots,3bq7bu,Trill_billl,7,Wed Jul 1 13:35:25 2015 UTC,"With the personnel grouping, it was actually quite possible that Lynch would be tackled in the backfield if they attempted to run. The moment the Seahawks put in 3 WRs and Belichick didn't call a time out, it had to be a pass. While Lynch may be one of the best RBs in the league, a goal-line run is a very different type of play where the linemen do all the work. Either they create a hole for the RB to fall through or they fail and the RB gets stuffed (very rarely do you have some fancy stuff where the RB gambles by looping back and trying to find a way in himself.). There is no fancy juking of tackles. The Seahawks were severely outmatched at the line cause they didn't put their big goal-line unit out there."
Patriots,3bq7bu,alisonstone,5,Wed Jul 1 14:08:18 2015 UTC,Fucking Cris Collinsworth is the worst fucking football analyst (if I can even use that word to describe him) on TV today. Fuck Cris fucking Fuckinsworth.
Patriots,3bq7bu,AndDuffy,2,Wed Jul 1 11:40:56 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you. I have hated him since the very first madden game he was on. I really think he is overrated, and the most common defense I see for him being a good analyst is that he notices things that others don't, however I think many do ese things are trivial and useless to fans, especially casual fans. Even as a long time football fan, I don't give a shit about 3/4 of the things he says. Also, he comes off as a smug Doucher who will remind you he knows more about football than you do every chance he gets."
Patriots,3bq7bu,PatricksPub,6,Wed Jul 1 18:11:29 2015 UTC,Seriously? I think he is the best by far. He sees 5 things on every play that we don't and talks about them before it even goes to replay. I wish I could watch a game through his eyes.
Patriots,3bq7bu,mk72206,3,Wed Jul 1 13:14:30 2015 UTC,"He makes some insightful points throughout the game, but for the most part has his attention glued to the public's perception of each play as opposed to the play itself. He's a great commentator for a casual, uneducated fan but for a hardcore football junky he is hard to listen to."
Patriots,3bq7bu,hashbrown17,-4,Wed Jul 1 13:53:35 2015 UTC,"He has a full view of the field so he can talk about things that happen downfield that aren't shown on live TV.

Patriots,3bq7bu,TheMagicianDolph,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:56:45 2015 UTC,I watched the game again about a week ago and kept track of some things out of curiosity. Lynch was 1/3 on 3rd and short including a key 3rd and 1 in the red zone which forced them to settle for a FG.   Also KJ Wright did not successfully guard Gronk on a single play. I don't have the sheet in front of me but I'm pretty sure it's 2 first downs and a TD.

Patriots,3br3kz,sugar_free_haribo,-3,Wed Jul 1 15:22:20 2015 UTC,"He just doesn't resonate as a hall of famer.

Vinatieri can play at least two more years at a reasonable level and get a little bit closer to Anderson's all time points record.  If he's close to the record and has Super Bowl winning kicks then I think he gets in.     It will be tough if Morten doesn't get in considering he has the records for most field goals all time, most points all time, most field goals for two different franchises (ATL, NO), most game winning field goals with 103 (never had a Super Bowl winning kick but kicked an NFC Championship winning field goal) etc.  The problem with kickers is that you don't put yourself in the position to kick a game winning field goal - you just end up there.  If Vinatieri can pass Anderson's point record then it's a no brainer but it would set a bad precedent if Morten doesn't get in."

Patriots,3br3kz,CoopThereItIs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:21:10 2015 UTC,"I know what you are saying but there are players that are absolute locks if they retired today like Brady, Manning, Brees, Woodson.  If I had to bet on it the list would be even bigger.  Based on current accumulated stats compared to their current peers and other Hall of Famers it would be absurd to keep Antonio Gates, Julius Peppers, Aaron Rodgers, Big Ben, Larry Fitzgerald etc. out of the hall."
Patriots,3br3kz,DocOne,0,Wed Jul 1 21:34:47 2015 UTC,Revis could retire today and he'd still be first ballot.  Also Vince is a lock as well.
Patriots,3br3kz,xPlasma,2,Wed Jul 1 19:37:10 2015 UTC,Vince is nowhere near a lock. As in....he's more likely to not get in the HoF than he is to get in the HoF.
Patriots,3br3kz,the_word_is,0,Wed Jul 1 20:20:42 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I think he is absolutely a lock. It is hard for D-lineman, and harder for NT's because so much of their game is clogging the middle, but I won't be surprised when he is first ballot 8 years from now."
Patriots,3br3kz,DocOne,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:22:00 2015 UTC,I agree that he's a lock but maybe not first ballot if only because of the position he plays.  I'd love it though
Patriots,3br3kz,the_word_is,2,Wed Jul 1 21:47:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I may have exaggerated there. Sometimes I'm simply a homer.
Patriots,3br3kz,DocOne,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:54:36 2015 UTC,Nothing wrong with that
Patriots,3br3kz,DocOne,-1,Wed Jul 1 22:02:56 2015 UTC,"He's widely regarded as one of, if not the best NT to ever play, and not just by Pats fans.  If he doesn't get in then Warren Sapp shouldn't be in, Cortez Kennedy shouldn't be in, a dozen other DTs shouldn't be in."
Patriots,3br3kz,xPlasma,2,Wed Jul 1 21:38:00 2015 UTC,"the Hall doesn't differentiate between NT and DT. AFAIK not a single NT is in the hall. Wilfork does NOT have flashy stats. He has 16 career sacks. For reference, Sapp had 16.5 in one season. Sapp has almost 4 times as my forced fumbles. There are 14 defensive tackles in the HoF. Wilfork doesn't stack up statistically to any of them. With the relative influx of dominate defense lineman in teh current day. Wilfork will be seen as ""really good for a really long time, but never great"""
Patriots,3br3kz,DocOne,0,Wed Jul 1 22:03:36 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, and you're not wrong, but with the push towards more advanced stats, across all sports, more people will look past the one trick ponies and flash and look at players actual contributions, not just highlights, like Vince consistently stacking triple teams and GAINING ground...for over a decade.  Also, this forced wait time between posts is stupid."
Patriots,3br3kz,xPlasma,3,Wed Jul 1 22:13:12 2015 UTC,"I believe if you verify your email address you don't need to wait in between posts.   I think Wilfork's contributions are going to be overlooked. It is really hard to objectively tell how effective a player was on a play where they didn't make the play. (IMO Browner's play on the Butler pick was just as impressive as the interception, but unless you are looking for it, you can't see it.) I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it, but players like him don't make the HoF, thats just how it is. He'll be in the pats Hall and might even get his number retired."
Patriots,3br3kz,PantsB,11,Wed Jul 1 22:37:27 2015 UTC,"Already in: Seau  Lock first ballot: Brady, BB  Lock: Moss  Near Lock: Vinatieri, Seymour (3x first team all pro is usually plenty), Revis  Maybes: Law, Harrison, Wilfork, Mankins, Waters, Dillon, Taylor, Welker  Too early but likely: Gronk"

Patriots,3br3kz,fawkeswow,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:11:12 2015 UTC,It probable won't happen but it's gonna be awesome if Brady and BB retire together and be inducted to the hall at the same time.
Patriots,3br3kz,yalemartin,-1,Wed Jul 1 21:58:23 2015 UTC,"Gronk has the talent to make the hall of fame, but to use the word 'likely' for a 26 year old who so far has missed 20% of his career with injury is a reach. Durability doesn't get better with age either. If that doesn't improve then Rob Gronkowski will not make the HOF.  I'll stick with 'possible' for now."
Patriots,3br3kz,Bigbohn,3,Wed Jul 1 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"i agree with your overall assessment as not likely, but possible but Edelman is proof that injuries in the early carreer is not necessarily indicative of what a players durability will look like later on."
Patriots,3br3kz,xPlasma,2,Wed Jul 1 18:08:54 2015 UTC,"Lets say that Rob Gronkowski keeps up the same exact numbers for 5 more years. Doubling every stat he has, games missed to injury and all. He will have 108 TDs Caught. and 2 rushing (lol). That will put him 7th all time despite ""only"" playing 10 seasons and missing 20% of that time due to injury. Unless the patriots can not find another Quarterback after Brady Gronk is a lock. Not only is he already one of the top 100 prolific TD catchers already he's also considered to be one of the best blocking TEs in the league. And if he plays 10 more years at the exact same pace he will be at 162 career td receptions, trailing only Rice.   Gronkowski has yet to play his 26 year old season. He is just now entering his physical prime. Gronkowski just needs to keep up the exact same pace and not only will he be in the hall of fame, he will be regarded as the 2nd best non-QB player of all time and god forbid he gets better...."
Patriots,3br3kz,SpecOpBeevee,4,Wed Jul 1 22:33:54 2015 UTC,Most people have already listed the likely HOFers but I would love Wilfork to get in
Patriots,3br3kz,TheMagicianDolph,2,Wed Jul 1 16:45:58 2015 UTC,He wont
Patriots,3br3kz,SpecOpBeevee,2,Wed Jul 1 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"I doubt he gets in as a DT which so far is their only category, he doesn't have the sack numbers to compare, but he has a chance if they put him in as a Nose Tackle"

Patriots,3br3kz,WKWA,2,Wed Jul 1 15:15:49 2015 UTC,"Seymour, Moss, Revis, Law, and Vinateri, should be locks. Wilfork and Harrison will be on the fringe and Gronk is the way too early candidate."
Patriots,3br3kz,PatricksPub,2,Wed Jul 1 15:16:11 2015 UTC,"Randy Moss, Gronkowski, Darrelle Revis, and maybe Richard Seymour."
Patriots,3br3kz,DCMurphy,2,Wed Jul 1 18:17:00 2015 UTC,"Moss, and Bruschi. Revis and Gronk are on pace to get there"
Patriots,3br3kz,DCMurphy,8,Wed Jul 1 14:07:25 2015 UTC,"Can't imagine Bruschi will get in. Excellent player, great heart, model Patriot, Patriot hall of famer absolutely, but no chance for the NFL hall of fame, his play didn't transcend the game."
Patriots,3br3kz,HippoProblems,3,Wed Jul 1 14:41:40 2015 UTC,I've never been terribly good at assessing HoF caliber or not; he was the first guy who came to mind aside from Randy Moss being the obvious candidate of a standout player.
Patriots,3br3kz,Mel_Gibsons_Sanity,2,Wed Jul 1 15:25:01 2015 UTC,Perfect guy for the Pats Hall. Doesn't have great career stats. Making clutch interceptions in the playoffs makes you a beloved Patriot but not a HOFer.
Patriots,3br3kz,Re-AnImAt0r,2,Wed Jul 1 17:11:10 2015 UTC,"I think Teddy will actually get close if not squeak in in like 10 - 15 years.  You mention transcending the game, Bruschi was the leader of a D credited for being the driving force for winning 3 of 4 SB's (This is a big factor of how O-line guys get in), so I think with some voters, that will sit very very well.  Enough voters?  Probably not, not for a while, not until these guys can talk it out plenty year after year.  Also, he very well could be on the ballot on a year in the future where he makes the top 10 and then he might sneak in based on his leadership and contribution to that defense in the early 2000's.  I think he has a chance (small chance, like 10 - 20%), but he needs a year with a relatively weak class and it's not going to be anytime soon."

Patriots,3bmxds,ClarkFable,-4,Tue Jun 30 23:53:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Gronk needs to lean forward more before initiating contact. If he keeps running straight up like this it's only a matter of time before he loses the knee again.  Tackling low is never really a dirty hit unless the offensive player can't see you coming, or if you are deliberately spearing with the top of your helmet. If you slow the video down, you can see the defensive player square up, and the majority of the contact is with his shoulder pads."
Patriots,3bmxds,merlindegr8,4,Wed Jul 1 13:48:04 2015 UTC,"Firstly, Gronk turned up field and spun to avoid his knee being taken out. It happened so quickly he didn't have time to do anything else. Secondly, What part of that play did you see a TACKLE? That was spearing with the crown of the helmet.  Dirty."
Patriots,3bmxds,ClarkFable,-8,Tue Jun 30 17:16:34 2015 UTC,"Gronk took three full steps with his head forward before the hit came.  If he started leaning that hit would have barely move him.  And if you watch the angle from the backfield, you clearly see the defensive player place his head to the side of Gronk's knee, even though Gronk shifted his leg as the hit was coming in.  He did not fly in  and spear him from the side as you claim (the defensive player clearly breaks down before making the tackle).    It was almost textbook.  The part that was a ""TACKLE"", was the part where Gronk ended up on the ground."
Patriots,3bmxds,JoeyJoJoJrShabbadoo,5,Tue Jun 30 17:34:03 2015 UTC,"The fact that you refer to that incident as ""almost textbook"" has clearly rendered all your future opinions about EVERYTHING in the world,  irrelevant."
Patriots,3bmxds,ClarkFable,-9,Tue Jun 30 18:07:25 2015 UTC,"1.) You've clearly never played football.  2.) If you think he speared him with the crown of his helmet in the knee, you need glasses."

Patriots,3bmxds,psychosus,3,Tue Jun 30 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"Well, if you played football then you must suck at tackling if this is your idea of an 'almost textbook' tackle."
Patriots,3bmxds,ClarkFable,-1,Tue Jun 30 20:51:30 2015 UTC,"It's not a matter of technique, it's a matter of situational feasibility.  You can't form tackle Gronk there, or you'll get trucked  http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/02/02/graphic-the-grossest-super-bowl-injury-from-sundays-game/  But I'm sure you thought it was great when Edelman did it."
Patriots,3bmxds,psychosus,2,Tue Jun 30 19:28:33 2015 UTC,"I'd hardly consider ""Hurt him to stop him because I can't tackle him without dislocating my shoulder"" (a la - the Rodney Harrison career ender) to be a lousy argument. It is alo a huge backtrack from arguing that it's a textbook tackle.   You might not have a problem with a player purposefully injuring someone because they can't tackle them, but to me it's just not being as good at football as they are. There is the alternative of not tackling them at all, which is just as useful if you whiff on the attempt to injure them but has none of the dick-move-ishness.   Edelman wasn't coming at Lane head on and had the courtesy not to obliterate his knees as he came at him. The distance he was away from lane as he leapt at him wouldn't have caused any serious injury to his arms had he used them - it just would have screwed with his momentum. Lane's wrist breaking was an actual accident rather than an intended consequence.   TJ Ward had the opportunity to make a tackle like he made on Shipley the first time he wrecked Gronk's knee. He chose to take his knees out rather than take the hard hit up high. The hard hit would have pushed Gronk sideways and stopped his momentum for sure. He even had help right on Gronk's heels. He was a pussy about it because he didn't want to get caught up with his teammate when he made the hit.   The second attempt at Gronk's knee was similar. He wasn't risking a serious injury with a good tackle. He was aiming to injure Gronk because he wasn't gonna be able to stop Gronk in his tracks and had no help to bring him down. Another pussy move."
Patriots,3bmxds,ClarkFable,-2,Tue Jun 30 20:56:39 2015 UTC,"Edelman wasn't coming at Lane head on and had the courtesy not to obliterate his knees as he came at him.    FYI: Edelman tore Lane's ACL with that hit (I'd say Lane broke his own arm falling awkwardly).  So no. Edelman's tackle was much more reckless, but still legit...because it's football.    You might not have a problem with a player purposefully injuring someone because they can't tackle them, but to me it's just not being as good at football as they are.    I would argue that Gronk running like an oaf is what makes him susceptible to injury. The fact remains, the tackle was not illegal, so complaining that it was dirty is just being soft.  Lean forward when you run up the field and these types of tackles won't destroy your knee.    Ward had the opportunity to make a tackle like he made on Shipley the first time he wrecked Gronk's knee.   Again, if Gronk doesn't run like an oaf here, he doesn't lose his knee. If you are going to run like Forest Gump up the heart of a defense, you are going to pay the price.   He wasn't risking a serious injury with a good tackle. He was aiming to injure Gronk because he wasn't gonna be able to stop Gronk in his tracks and had no help to bring him down. Another pussy move.   What are you talking about? He brought Gronk right down. If he had tried to form tackle him he would have been dragged another 10 yards."
Patriots,3bmxds,psychosus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:35:03 2015 UTC,"Moral of the story is that trying to hurt someone because it's easier (and by proxy more effective) than tackling is the mark of a cheap player and an asshole. Running like an oaf must be pretty fucking effective if your only option is a cheap low hit. That kind of hit will destroy your knee no matter what.  And you're a douche for thinking that's okay because ""it's football"". And also for editing your post after the fact. Please don't ever coach football."
Patriots,3bmxds,parrisnorris,2,Tue Jun 30 22:21:46 2015 UTC,No matter what Ward put his head down initially. Yeah he sort of squared up at his knees bit he lowered and used the crown of his helmet to lead his body into his attempted tackle. If your gonna tackle someone around the legs  it should never be like that.
Patriots,3bmxds,ClarkFable,0,Tue Jun 30 23:04:02 2015 UTC,How else would you tackle someone low?  This is how is done: http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/02/02/graphic-the-grossest-super-bowl-injury-from-sundays-game/

Patriots,3bmxds,ThePaddingtonBear,-10,Tue Jun 30 20:50:58 2015 UTC,"I thought maybe some time would bring some of the whinier portions of our fanbase back to reality, but perhaps I shouldn't be surprised. There's nothing objectionable about this play."
Patriots,3bmxds,TB12toJE11,7,Tue Jun 30 19:56:54 2015 UTC,"You know, except for the part where he leads with his helmet aiming for the knee. The only difference between this hit and the one that tore his ACL is that Gronk's foot wasn't planted this time. I'm not one of these guys who will complain or call Ward dirty, but this is not a safe way to tackle and is exactly how knees get blown out. You can tackle big guys like Gronk with proper tackling which won't potentially end the other guy's career. Like I said, saying ""Fuck Ward"" is stupid, but to say there isn't anything objectionable is simply wrong."
Patriots,3bmxds,ThePaddingtonBear,-7,Tue Jun 30 20:52:38 2015 UTC,"You know, except for the part where he leads with his helmet aiming for the knee.   Nope, not objectionable. We're talking about football, remember?   The only difference between this hit and the one that tore his ACL is that Gronk's foot wasn't planted this time.   That is totally correct and totally irrelevant as there was nothing objectionable about that hit either."
Patriots,3bmxds,TB12toJE11,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:58:25 2015 UTC,"Sounds like we just disagree on the definition of objectionable (which is subjective in the first place). Ending another players season/career because a player can't tackle properly is pretty objectionable in my view. Making that same hit a year later and being lucky that player didn't have his foot planted is also objectionable in my view. If that were the only way to tackle in the sport of football, I'd say you are right. However, there are safer/more effective ways of tackling which makes Wards insistence of putting other players in danger objectionable in my opinion.  If you want to actually discuss the topic rather than saying ""You're wrong because I'm right"", I'm all ears."
Patriots,3bmxds,ThePaddingtonBear,-3,Tue Jun 30 20:09:27 2015 UTC,"there are safer/more effective ways of tackling   Ward's job isn't to tackle in the safest way. It's to tackle, and how he chose to go about doing so seemed plenty effective to me. What he did was perfectly legal and therefore not objectionable."
Patriots,3bmxds,Bigbohn,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"How dare you defend your stance with logic, context, and the rule book. You should be ashamed you monster."
Patriots,3bmxds,bpstyles,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:00:05 2015 UTC,"You're not going to win. But, you're absolutely right. This kind of tackle happens twenty times a game, but we only notice it when it is between the hashes and at least ten yards downfield.  You said it best, though. Ward's job is not to tackle safely. His job is to tackle effectively [and not get penalized.] The NFL has decided to eliminate one safe way (and, yes, it is safe) so here we are."
Patriots,3bmxds,bpstyles,-8,Tue Jun 30 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"I'll get excoriated for this comment, but I find no fault in Ward's actions or most anyone else on a football field.  It's the NFL's lies that led to insane rules to prevent impossible-to-prevent concussion problems that have all defenders with no idea what to do."
Patriots,3bmxds,Stubbula,6,Wed Jul 1 02:53:49 2015 UTC,The problem is he launched himself with the crown of his helmet towards his knees with his arms essentially tucked under him. Nothing in the NFL says you can't use your arms to wrap people up. It's piss poor and dangerous tackling.
