singapore,3e398z,trashgoddess,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:23:36 2015 UTC,"Wow I didn't know this exists, time to check in.   Anyway OP some advice: since your gf is more or less financially independent, she needs to make the fact known to her parents. Whenever my mum wants to do stupid things like that to me, I always issue an ultimatum: do you want to keep quiet / stop talking about that so we can have a nice evening together?   I'll ask 3 times, repeating the number of times I have issued this ultimatum. On the third time, I'll specifically mention this is the last time. If she continues talking, I walk away. Out of the house or wherever if I need to.   The most infuriating thing you can do to someone who wants to tell you shit is to not take it. Simple as that."

Rent a place somewhere, or stay with you for the immediate time being. Note that in both cases, there will be other repercussions to come should her parents pursue the matter that may make her feel worse but it still looks better than continuing to stay with her family.  After which you will have to monitor to see if things improve in her emotional and mental state.   In the meantime, bring her to see a counselor"

(you might not know this yet since you've yet to enlist, but S1 refers to the manpower officer of your unit)"
singapore,3e299g,veryfascinating,5,Tue Jul 21 12:51:23 2015 UTC,"This is correct. Personally applied for ~35 days of disruption, left on the week prior to the first week of school."

singapore,3e299g,shiaawase,6,Tue Jul 21 13:37:09 2015 UTC,"Work in a S1 (manpower) branch, many people disrupt around august to go for uni. For now, don't worry too much about it, it's quite common for people to disrupt. Ensure that you do it at least 3 months before uni, the earlier the better (about 6 months before is optimal). Just ask your commanders about it when you have decided on it and they'll tell you how to go about doing it."
singapore,3e299g,endthisshiz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:49 2015 UTC,"emphasizing on the 6 months part, give your S1 branch ample time to process it. mine took 4 months to get approval. turns out, my S1 clerk sat on it for 2 months because he wanted to wait for another fella to process both together to PersNode, but that other bloke took forever to gather his documents. stuff like that does happen."

singapore,3e299g,veryfascinating,0,Tue Jul 21 13:42:16 2015 UTC,"not really, my friend ORD in september/october but also granted disruption. its just that their payback is super long. like 2 months worth of reservist but complete with COS duty etc. not the best way to spend you uni holiday eh..."
singapore,3e299g,razornova,2,Tue Jul 21 12:55:40 2015 UTC,Like I said it's based on your university's start date. Your ORD date is irrelevant. You will always get to disrupt a few days before school begins

singapore,3e299g,razornova,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:23 2015 UTC,Yes you managed to disrupt 4 months before your ORD... But just before your university's start date no?
singapore,3e299g,veryfascinating,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:51:20 2015 UTC,"you'll only be allowed to disrupt on the friday before you start school IIRC. some units may allow disruption from the week before this.  Really depends on your unit, cos different friends received different instructions. bear in mind it's an official disruption so mindef will only use your official school start date to approve the disruption.  as for orientation camps, use your off and leave. that's the only solution. best is if you can get into the good books of your commanders, so that when you take your leave, u can tell them that its for uni stuff so they wont touch/disturb you or call you back. especially if you get into a service vocation like medic or driver."

I will however, agree with u/fluffy_cucumber that this is not about filial piety: this is domestic violence and above all an attack on a woman. Much suffrages have been given to women – including those in the golden years – but never hit on a woman unless she's really asking for it.

singapore,3e2ci1,Redhair22,2,Tue Jul 21 12:34:03 2015 UTC,"Sgs are govt bonds. If memory serves, a 10 year sgs pays 2.23% per annum. Which is pretty good, considering SG govt debt has a really good credit rating! Rated Aaa iirc. Better rating than US govt bonds.   You purchase the sgs thru ATM or secondary market (via Singapore exchange)  For ATM you got to look at the sgs website to see when they are issuing. Their website has more details.   Singapore govt bonds are good for risk adverse investors.   The Singapore savings bonds product that has been in the news has returns that are pegged to sgs returns."
singapore,3e2ci1,jswk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:39:02 2015 UTC,So how much should one invest in sgs bonds? Is $10000 worth the time or do one need to at least invest say $50000 for it to be worth it?
singapore,3e2ci1,jswk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:32 2015 UTC,"govt bonds are low risk in nature, so how much you wanna allocate to govt bonds, depends on your risk appetite  typically younger people are able to take on more risk, whilst older people want to take on less risk. One formula you can use is 110 - your age. Say you are 30 years old, 110 - 30 = 80. So following this model, 80% of your portfolio allocate to shares, 20% to bonds"
singapore,3e2ci1,iemfi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:14 2015 UTC,I think 36% to CPF already covers most of the 20% bond thing. If you're not adverse to risk just put it all into international index funds.

singapore,3e2ci1,asiankid96,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:52 2015 UTC,"Higher returns require higher risk but higher risk doesn't guarantee higher returns. SGS will net you a return of 2+% with a very very low chance that you will lose your money (i.e. Very low risk) because Singapore's government is quite stable. An ETF will likely return more but there is a higher risk. Although by design it diversifies you across the market, you can still lose money. For example, in the '08 crash the S&P500 dropped 40% from peak to trough. If you were invested in an ETF tracking the S&P500 back then you'd have lost 40%, if you were in US govt bonds you'd have made money, not a lot but still net positive."

Play everything. Dont stick to genres. The best DJs I have ever witnessed have been able to cross between hiphop, edm, house, drum and bass, funk, metal, pop and trance.  The key is to take the listener on a journey, and if you do that well enough, then genre is completely irrelevant. Dont limit yourself to just one area of music .. mix it all, because the only way you will differentiate yourself these days from ""everyone wants to be a DJ"" is by doing something unique, and there really are not that many people who do cross-genre sets well.  Good luck, its a fkn hard path to take, but if you're passionate, and willing to experiment with the music, then you'll be rewarded."
singapore,3e1b5i,Pollenset,7,Tue Jul 21 07:20:33 2015 UTC,"Can't listen to the track at the moment, but I can give you some general advice.  It sounds pretty obvious, but basically you want to keep at it and make LOTS and LOTS of mixes, and LOTS and LOTS of tracks.  If you push yourself just a little bit with each mix or track and make sure to ""release/finish"" them, then you will get better and better over time.    This advice is based on an anecdote from Art & Fear:   The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A”, forty pounds a “B”, and so on. Those being graded on “quality”, however, needed to produce only one pot -albeit a perfect one – to get an “A”. Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work – and learning from their mistakes – the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.   While it is technically an anecdote, I've seen it work and there have been studies on this effect as well but I don't have a literature reference at the moment."

They usually just make you redo redo redo until you get it right. Like they give you many chances.  Even for stuff like IMT, they make you chiong all the day shoots and get rather optimal results, so that you won't fail IMT.  So I don't think you'll really fail BMT.

Painting, coloring, needle felting, trying to get into crocheting, would like to get into music or sports... Quite interested in most things.

singapore,3dyij0,Spritzes,3,Tue Jul 21 00:24:56 2015 UTC,I'm self taught in knitting and crochet - I watched youtube videos and spent lots of time frustratingly ripping out wrongly done stitches but you'll definitely get there in the end! I don't crochet much but I do know how to read and follow patterns and look up stitches - that's basically all you really need! It's a long learning process but rewarding when you finish turning yarn into something! My best work is this knitted lace shawlette.    My biggest recommendation for you and /u/faithcsc would be to join Ravelry. It's got a bajillion resources for knitting and crochet (including lots of patterns) and a wonderful forum community as well if you want to ask questions! Look up the Singapore group forum there and ask for help there with classes and where to buy stuff for crochet- they'll probably be more helpful with that since I just look up youtube videos when I want to learn a new stitch or something.

I'm kiradex, dex is fine. 23 this year. Almost done with my national service (plucking all My wisdom tooth now). I stay at kovan. Not a bad place to stay. Though people mistake it to be some place where rich people stay. Lol.   I'm 1.75m. Weighing about 92kg. I know I'm fat. But I've been working out since army started and it seems I just can't drop below this weight!  Maybe its muscle mass? Idk. People say I don't look like 92. Ah well. Enrolling into digipen in a month's time. Scared as hell about the curriculum and life there in general.   I love to build model kits mainly gunpla. I play lots of computer games too. I also like to read and am going through GOT now. I also love to watch lots of American dramas such as GOT and stuff. Recently got addicted to jdramas and what they offer.  Have some friendship issues and as a result of that my social circle is seriously tiny. Which depresses me sometimes. Never had a girlfriend.   You should PM me if :   you're into video games and are looking for a buddy to game with.  you game on various consoles as I have a ps3/4 a vita and a 3ds. So I play most games. :) you just wanna be friends you're into gunpla or gundam as well. ( I only do oobs for gunpla but I do paint kits every now and then) you would like to discuss some deep philosophical stuff ( I find stuff like that really interesting. But I'm not sure if I can contribute fruitfully to a discussion but I'm willing to try) you enjoy long replies because I love to type and I enjoy receiving long replies too.

singapore,3dyij0,freshwound,13,Tue Jul 21 02:04:05 2015 UTC,"Just looking people who may resonate with me to chill/hangout with in this attempt to expand my social circle.   I just created a reddit account not long ago so I don’t really know a lot about the navigation of reddit. I usually just browse around without an account. This community seems nice!   Female, 20, 158, 46-47kg. ISFJ Personality. West side of Singapore NUS FASS. Didn’t join any freshman camps in year 1 so... quite a loner in school. Quite a nerd. I actually enjoy studying though sometimes it gets stressful. I love reading about history and politics. Music: I listen to all genres of music. You name it, I probably listen to it. Right now I’m into dance-punk, rap rave, ambient and 00’s pop. Favourite artists/bands include David Bowie, Die Antwoord, Marilyn Manson, Lydia, Spice Girls, Hurts, N’Sync, Incubus, HIM, Armin Van Buuren and Sigur Ros. Sigur Ros live in Singapore 2012 was one of the best concerts I’ve been to in Singapore. Rather small social circle. Spend most of my time at home watching shows like Adventure Time, Friends, Parks and Recreation, The Office, 2 Broke Girls... Mostly sitcoms. Quirk 1: I enjoy walking around places, like from Orchard to Bugis... or from Orchard to Clarke Quay.  Quirk 2: I love buying fancy stationery/school supplies. I have a ridiculous amount of pencil cases and pretty pens I’ll never use. Quirk 3: I enjoy baking and experimenting with new substitutes. For example, I try to find substitutes for butter, or eggs, and using natural foods as food colourings. Basically trying to come up with healthier versions. I’m one of those people without any hobbies or passions. This sucks because it has resulted in me having very limited friends. My whatsapp is almost never active. Trying to change and hoping finding the courage “explore” different interests."

Not really looking for love per se - I'm casually dating and if something happens, it happens. 160cm/Size 14/16 UK - I've got a little extra but I'm doing something about it - so, If you're into keto/paleo/jogging/swimming/lifting in the West side it might make going to the gym a little less intimidating! I plan to join one when I move west since the swimming pools are less accessible there and I really want to try Strong Lifts or Strong Curves or something. Plus, I'm kinda sick of constantly having to dodge people while swimming. I used to play games but not so much these days as it's either work/workout/sleep/socializing but when I was I loved Civ5 (still play on occasion), GTAV, Bioshock, RPGs, you get the idea. Right now I am obsessed with training the perfect dweller in Fallout Shelter. I like reading too - I have a kindle that I use to read trashy things like 50 shades (cringe, so much cringe) to more serious reads like The Book Thief, Stephen Ambrose's books on WWII, things on the Chinese Cultural Revolution etc. I like watching shows too - the more famous ones being GoT and Sherlock, and sitcoms like New Girl, Big Bang Theory, Friends, Scrubs. Personality quirks: I'm hella organized, like, I have a budget spreadsheet which I update daily. I pay my credit card bills as soon as I use them. I track my workouts and diet in MyFitnessPal. I have folders on my insurance and investment plans and important documents and bills. I am also prone to bouts of silliness and gutter brained moments but that's limited to a very select group of people. I have a not-so-small collection of My Little Pony figurines.   Edit:   I also love animals - dogs, guinea pigs, cats, rats, birds (in that order of favoritism). Unfortunately, due to the uncertainty of my long term plans and semi-nomadic nature of my life (travel about once a month) I have been holding off from getting a pet.

Interests   Science - Physics and Chemistry Photography - I specialise in landscape HDR and astrophotography. Though I am recently trying out portrait. Guitar - Self-taught guitarist for more than a decade. I play mostly classic rock and southern rock. It was with southern rock that taught me many techniques. I can argue with you that Duane Allman is the greatest guitarist of all time. Music - I listen to a wide range from classical to blues, rock and roll, country, southern rock, hard rock and metal. My favourite classical composers are Tchaikovsky, Beethoven and Vivaldi. I love jambands with 30mins guitar solos. Reading - Mostly non-fiction on science, though I dive into fiction at times. Computers - Fascinated with both hardware and software. I am interested in physical computing. That is using computers to control everyday items. I have been playing around with the raspberry pi a lot. Cooking - I roast & grill a lot. Being away from SG, I try to replicate many local dishes and snacks. DIY - Very hands on. I do a lot of building and repairing from household items to machines. Gardening - I grow my own fruits and herbs. I can elaborate more on this. Quirks - I do not watch TV ( I don't have a TV at home). I would rather walk around than to take public transport (of course within reason.. however I can be very reasonable...) Dislikes small talks and formal social events (or even social events for that matter). I love walking around furniture and home stores, especially the kitchen section. Loves animals and wildlife.   Well, PM if you would like to know more, have an intellectual conversation, or basically know a friend.  Edit: Will be back in SG soon. Let me know if you wanna hangout."

singapore,3dyij0,_HR,6,Tue Jul 21 01:29:51 2015 UTC,"21f, NTU HSS freshman. Previously studied arts management, volunteered and worked in the local arts industry's front and back end for 3+ years. Looking to meet makan/chitchat/hangout friends (from the West/NTU optional but would be ideal) since I'll be moving to pulau NTU all the way from my home in the East for a year.   Random facts about me/if you want to PM me to chit chat about the below you're very welcome:   I've lived in UK (mainly London) for two months collectively over two trips in the past couple of years. Consequently have gained many British comforts which I miss here like crumpets, comedy panel shows and the West End on my doorstep. Not to mention being able to take long walks without breaking a sweat.  I'm the cook of the house and cook dinner for my family on a regular basis. I also cook for friends and when we have CAH/other random card game sessions once in a while.  My favourite genre for literature is fantasy so works by Pratchett and Gaiman are right up my alley (I have a signed copy of Trigger Warning from a talk of his I attended in London. Good times). I do read a large range beyond that, including local works. If anyone's looking for a buddy to attend Singapore Writer's Festival with I'm game.  EDITED TO ADD: I also read webcomics: Questionable Content, Go Get a Roomie, Headless Bliss, DEMON, KhaosKomix and Shades of A to name a few.  I'm big on musicals (especially Sondheim) and soundtracks of video games/films/shows. My music library contains basically that and a smattering of classical music/contemporary ethic instrumental stuff.  I tend to get into hobbies at a less-than-proficient level for fun and abandon/come back to them in cycles. Naming a few: knitting, cardistry, cosplay, bouldering, writing, and more I can't be bothered to recall everything.  I'm a on-and-off gamer, meaning I can go months without playing anything and then spend a solid 2-3 weeks doing nothing but gaming. I play action buttonmashy types usually like KH, Bayonetta, Prototype, Drakengard/Nier series. Got into Skyrim last year as well, and looking for more games with archery incorporated as a significant part of gameplay. Recs welcome, I have a PS3 and PC that works enough to run Skyrim with a bunch of mods but not an ENB.  I'm interested in travel but hate tour packages. Other than aforementioned UK I've been to Japan twice and made pit stops at cities in central Europe & Korea. Recent trip to Japan has reignited my childhood love of the Tokyo Disney parks and am eagerly anticipating their expansion in 2017 and 35th anniversary in 2018.  I write really long multi-part replies to conversation usually. Please don't be intimidated. Tend to be much better in online conversation vs face to face interaction unless I already know you fairly well.    Obligatory not really looking for love disclaimer, I am asexual and not romantically interested in the opposite sex. I'm cool with hanging out with whoever though!"

singapore,3dyij0,Nigyims,3,Mon Jul 20 22:23:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not looking for love or anything but I think it's cool to get to know people in this community better. I browse /r/singapore pretty frequently and I've started to recognize a few usernames but I don't really know anybody.  About Me:   Male | Early 20s | ~178cm | ~74kg https://instagram.com/ongd1/ Computer Science undergrad studying in Silicon Valley Singaporean but spent a few years growing up in Tokyo and New York   How I spend my time:   Music - I listen to all kinds of genre (including metal and country *gasp*). This is the Spotify playlist that I've been listening to the most. I don't know how to describe the genre. This is going to sound kinda pretentious but I guess it's alternative house? I don't know. All the sub-genres of electronic music confuse me. I've been playing the guitar for years but I still kind of suck. I have stupid fingers :( Photography (latest photo) - I just started to really get into photography earlier this month when my sister gave me her old EOS 500. I just ordered an EF 50mm STM lens. Should arrive in 1-3 days (yay USA shipping). Reading - I tend to get really into certain genres. Right now it's fantasy. Last year I read tons of sci-fi. I was really into non-fiction before that. Favorite authors right now are Neil Gaiman, Brandon Sanderson, Haruki Murakami. Does anybody here use Goodreads? Lifting - Spend about 1.5 hours in the gym every other day. Bulking is actually super fun. I get to eat all the food I want and it's very satisfying to hit new PRs almost every workout. I'm not crazy about all the fat gains though. I'll probably bulk through winter and start cutting in spring. I also used to be a competitive swimmer at SSC but I don't really swim that much anymore. Eating & cooking - I absolutely love food and I'm a half decent chef. I didn't cook a lot last year since I was on my uni meal plan but I'll probably cook most of my meals this upcoming year. If I could only eat one type of cuisine for the rest of my life, it would probably choose Japanese cuisine. Film & TV - Netflix is definitely my #1 time sink. TV shows I watch: Game of Thrones, Silicon Valley, The Flash. Favorite recent movies: Ex Machina, Mad Max, Boyhood, Still Alice."

singapore,3dyij0,_HR,8,Tue Jul 21 03:07:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting question. I actually might have preferred it if they defaulted. Bringing in more austerity during a period where greece's economy tanks is gonna make the situation worse. They are in a budget surplus but the fact that their economy might shrink makes debt/gdp ratio higher. Also if they left the eu, they would have their own currency which will rapidly depricate and make exports cheaper. Right now though, I guess since they are staying, they can fix their structural issues and 'clean' the system. But i dont think they will recover that soon."

singapore,3dyij0,RubberBandit__,4,Tue Jul 21 12:39:02 2015 UTC,"Hello, I'm Antonio, I'm 18 this year and weight 92kg this year and 176cm.  I've been trying to lose weight and so far have lost about 5 kg in the last month, still trying hard. I seriously want to be fit. I've been cycling 2 a week and running once a week, I was thinking of attempting to go to a gym, but I have no idea what to do.   I am looking for a relationship, I have an extremely small group of friends but that's how I like it so I'm okay on the friendship front(but I don't mind having more friends) . I've never been in a relationship, so I don't have any idea on what I want. My head is telling me long-term only because if you are going to do something, you either put all your effort or you don't attempt at all. I don't know, I have no idea what to expect, so I'll let you, the PMing person decide.   I am seriously introverts by nature (I'm an INTJ if you will) and can go for days without physically talking to someone. My longest record of not talking is a week. Being an INTJ means no drama or anything, I am a extremely rational person and the will try to avoid conflict as much as I can.   My likes & hobbies:   I am interested in computing, from the hardware to the software just about everything. Although I am more interested in storage, I just love talking about the latest news on data storage. I am also very into programming, and have a few projects in mind.  I love walking & architecture, these two hobbies & likes go hand in hand. My favourite place to walk is the cbd, I've walked from one end or the cbd to the other end and everywhere between and because I walk so much in the cbd, I have grown to love and analyse the buildings I past by, so in some ways, architecture is a like out of a hobby.  I am into anime & renaissance fairs. I am not a hardcore fan, but I watch just to pass time, I've attend a few convention here and there, but only the big ones. To me anime is part of the entire media I consume, I also watch YouTube(Like a TV) and listen to podcast(Like a radio), I tend watch anime because they are more interesting that US TV serials, anime tends to cover more themes. As for renaissance fairs, Singapore doesn't have any, but I've been meaning to get period correct clothing just for fun and dressing up.  I'm am into a lot of music, I listen to everything except, mainstream pop, certain genres of mental, kpop and noise. I listen to electronic music(all genres and I mean all genres) , symphony (sometimes opera and baroque) swing, jazz or basically anything before the 60's and Jpop(not so much) , Jrock(very much).  Anything that is intellectually. stimulating or something that I can speculate about. What to talk about a specific branch of philosophy? Sure. Want to talk about civil engineering? Can do. Or how about games? Of course, but be prepared to talk about the physic engine or the story and game play aspect that affect how the game is played, I don't talk about strategy or what, I break down and analyse the game into their component. I am fine with talking about anything, you could ask a stupid question but if it makes me think, I will entertain you.    You should PM me if  — you can relate or like any of my points, especially number 5.  — optimist, extroverted and enthusiastic because they force me out of my introverted shell but I still need you to understand that I still need my own personal time.   — And if you have managed to read through everything, I tend to ramble on and on by myself."

I do a lot of it. I regularly sit at a bar, smoking, writing stupid poetry that I only every so often read to people at random events.  Yes, I smoke, its my body and not only do I not like judgemental people I also ... cant stand material people. Bad place for it here, alas. I enjoy playing guitar I am a complete nerd. I like dnd and playing star wars miniatures wargames (Armada) love hiphop, breaks, drum n bass Ang Mo. Yes, I live here. I absolutely hate the ""Expat scene"" here and avoid places like cq like the plague. I didnt move to a new country to hang out with and do the same things I did back home. Or get accosted by spgs. Id rather eat at a hawkers than any fancy restaurant. unless that restaurant is japanese. my favourite food is Bak Kuh Teh, and, Im sorry, but the Klang herbal one is better .. not a fan of the SG pepper bkt. I wear a suit at work. outside of work, I wear shorts and jeans. The only exceptions to this is for weddings, or extremely formal events - I hate formal wear, and having to strap it on every day makes me loath it even more. I read obsessively. Mostly scifi and fantasy. Literally, the size of my book collection is.. Let's just say it's in storage, and there is no room in it now. I think I have a problem.  I love street photography, if anyone wants to go out shooting some time .. I am extremely laid back. I guess thats natural - I am Australian. I love robots.

singapore,3e2n6d,sn_zy,3,Tue Jul 21 14:12:07 2015 UTC,"Have you passed BTT/FTT? If not you want to take your BTT asap, and take lessons while waiting for FTT - that's the biggest factor that's out of your control because the waiting time for the theory tests is horrible (like 2-3 months sometimes).  Other than that, it depends on whether you're planning to do it privately or by school. Both ways are possible - by private you need to make sure the instructor is both suited to your learning style and also has enough slots for you (if he has too many students then it will be hard), school is a lot easier in the sense that it is very structured - and as long as you remember to chiong on the day the slots open (booking for 2 months later), you will definitely be able to make it. One more pro to doing it by school is that you can book for the TP within 2-3 weeks while private is usually 1 month+ of waiting (they usually block out some slots for their school students, that's why). The con is that the school route is more expensive (lesson wise. plus you need to fulfil X number of lessons, clearing all the school modules - private is a bit more flexible and cheaper for lessons).  If money isn't too much of a factor (I spent about 2.4k in total - and that is with the peak hour surcharge for all lessons + a fixed instructor for about 18 out of 27 lessons). It's hard to say but private can be more expensive if you end up failing multiple times - school is more structured, and allows you unlimited access to the circuit during lessons so if you are trying to hit a deadline, I'd try that. For what it's worth - I started lessons in early April and did my TP in early June (28 total lessons in that timeframe), so it's definitely possible with some spare time for the possibility of failing (hopefully not though!) 1-2 times.  I'm more familiar with school so hit me up if you need questions regarding that, with private you'd probably have to seek the proper advice (and maybe a recommendation of instructor) from someone else.  Good luck OP!"

Our own little insecurities prevent us from expressing what we feel and think and in doing so make us afraid from going out and dare I say conquer the world.  And the worse thing is that it makes us extremely boring. Our personality is in large parts defined by the external expression of our thoughts and actions, but if you keep them bottled up for fear of offending you can guess what it looks like."

I'm in my mid 20s, and planning to travel a lot for work up till my early thirties, really make the most of my youth and early career to get out there and live, so I'm hesitant to get too emotionally involved in anything, or raise too many expectations.   But then it feels like I'm missing out on something wonderful,  romance in your twenties is something else, some of my close friends are really happy together. And you start to wonder why it's gotta be mutually exclusive..  You just gotta put in the effort and legwork, on yourself, but on others too, I guess. It just gets harder the more greedy you are :p"

singapore,3dxt50,Cybersteel,12,Mon Jul 20 15:55:39 2015 UTC,"OP, not all girls club, drink and focus on the superficial aspect of looks.   You will be the kind of stable guy that attracts girls looking to settle for a long-term relationship. What you need to realise is that:  (1) It is ok not to look handsome. But you must at least look clean and presentable. Attitude and posture matters. If you are confident and relaxed about yourself, you will come across as a lot more attractive than if you are slouching and negative.  (2) You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. Don't worry about girls who are ""out of your league"". Just get used to rejection so that you train your ego not to be too fragile. Rejection will be normal in life anyway when you start applying for jobs or tendering for business.  (3) The problem with nice guys is that is all they are. Nice.   Nice and boring. Nice guys are everywhere, so how do you find a way for yourself to stand out? How can you be more interesting, while still being yourself and enjoying the activities you do? That is something you need to think about."
singapore,3dxt50,iwantsmoothballs,21,Mon Jul 20 22:03:15 2015 UTC,"The problem with nice guys is that is all they are.   This isn't the problem with ""nice guys"". There's nothing wrong with being a genuinely nice person. It's when you do ""nice"" things only because you're looking for a reaction/something in return that it starts to become a problem."
singapore,3dxt50,palysg,5,Mon Jul 20 13:09:55 2015 UTC,"How about nice girls? If they so much as say hello, it stays on my mind. If they return texts, my heart races. The day one calls me, I know I'll look at my call history and grin. But that's just them being nice. People who are nice to me are also nice to everyone else. I almost end up forgetting that. If the truth is cruel , then lies must be kind. That's why kindness is a lie. I gave up on always expecting it, always mistaking it, and even hoping for it. Someone who's' worked so hard at being alone doesn't fall for the same trick twice. I'm a veteran at this. I’m the best when it comes to losing. That's why I'll always hate nice girls."

singapore,3dxt50,MALNOURISHED_DOG,6,Tue Jul 21 00:19:10 2015 UTC,"You need to stop putting girls up on a pedestal. That's why you end up hating ""nice"" girls, because you expect too much from them and when reality turns out to be different, your natural reaction will be anger towards them.  I suggest focussing on self-improvement first. Work out, build your confidence and join more outside of work/school activities which may help to meet more people (read: girls) and improve your communication skills etc.   I'll probably get downvoted for this, but some of the advice on /r/TheRedPill might help you and OP. Cheers.   Edit: I think Singaporean girls are more comfortable with closed setting meetings - street hookups are quite rare for the average joe here. So joining activities which you think are beneficial to your self-development and also have girls in them may help you to score a date or two. I may be generalising, but that's what I've observed so far."

singapore,3dxt50,Hope83,10,Mon Jul 20 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"Let me help you out with online dating.  PHASE 1  Buy a nice outfit /fa/ got some nice recommendation  Clean your face twice a day.. dont sleep late no oily food if you wanna look like a pretty boy. Also get a tidy haircut which is in fashion or sorts.  Get a friend who can take good portrait and ask him  to take for you a nice one.. (make sure he dont get carried away with editing). PICTURES are important for online dating.. a good photographer can make you look handsome as fuark with good lighting and right lenses. what more with that clean face and some good clothes too. Dont worry about weight, if a girl likes you even when you are chubby or skinny that means shes a fucking keeper.  PHASE 2  so what your online dating profile says on tinder or okcupid? You gotta have some sense of humor on your profile, im sure you can come out with something witty. Girls gets interested in witty guys with some sense of humor (if all else fail go to 4chan and read all these witty son of bitches shitpost.) If you are totally dull, then are you an animal person? If you are say it, girls like guys who loves animal and compassionate about them.   your profile description about yourself is really important, dont type too much like a thesis paper about yourself, make it short sweet and witty will be a bonus. The keyword here is BE MYSTERIOUS, it makes women want to know you more. Never post boring shit like which Graphic cards makes you cum or why PAP are scumbags, these will turn them off.  PHASE 3  WOW a girl likes you or you got a match! or she replied!! oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck what do i do?  Well dont just start with HELLO continued with small talks.. its gonna end there when you havent even started. Look through her description and her photos, take some time to how you can use these information to strike up a good conversation starter. For example you saw her picture when shes in a certain location that you have been,  a picture of her in New York and maybe you have been there or something, then you say ""hey! i saw a picture of you in NYC, did you go to SoHo? i love the architecture there!"". OR in the description she likes a US TV series that you also like for example ""oh you like game of thrones?, i love how there are many foreshadowing in every scene blah blah blah"". Do you notice something in these conversation? yes it has to be both interesting and intellectual at the same time so it wont get stale. These conversations will eventually branch out and she will always look forward for your messages and if she really likes your company you will get the holy grail of all dating sites..   HER PHONE NUMBER.  PHASE 4  its been awhile since you both chatted, she seems to reply to your every messages and have not backed down since.. what do you do next?  ASK HER OUT FFS.  how? easy, say you got a discount for some nice restaurant (something she would also like), and you tell her since she likes this type of food she is the first person you know that enjoys or appreciate it. YOU KNOW what she likes and im telling you she will be flattered she wont say no. Go take out your best-est outfit and get a hair cut and depends on her preference if she likes bearded men, stay unshaven. Make sure you buy cologne and smell nice. If you drive, pick her up, if not meet her somewhere and be punctual, yes BE PUNCTUAL. Dont be nervous just chat casually like how you messaged her on the phone. You dont have to pay for the bill, go dutch, its ok really. Then go somewhere and have a chat or something.   Things to do when you are with her  -Smile a lot  -Maintain eye contact  -tell funny stories  -be gentle  -dont be a chauvinist asshole  -be polite  its simple gestures like this that will make her think of you before she go to bed. When your date has ended and you go home and she still message you the next day....  you have done it. One day you will be giving her the D and its not rape.  May the Force be with you young padawan."

singapore,3dxt50,CaiPngIsLife,6,Mon Jul 20 16:19:37 2015 UTC,"On the contrary to what you said about online dating, even ugly guys can pick up girls. It's not about looks or physique, it's about confidence. Of course you cannot be dressed like a slop and expect you will attract girls. Girls like guys with confidence, they like guys with ambition and purpose.   Aside from that, if you want to be bold, ask your ""small social circle"" group of friends to set you up with someone that might be suitable for you. Go join activities that will give you opportunities to get to know new people.  And worry less about whether your interests will bore girls. If there is a girl who likes you because you are engaging in death-defying daredevil stunts in your life, that probably isn't a girl you would want to have as a wife anyway."

If a gorgeous girl who's also smart, funny and into you showed up, would you treat her like she's got a dick just because you work together? Hell no!  My two cents: love is much harder to find than a good job. So feel free to keep an eye out. Go for chill dates. Figure out if you two really wanna try being a couple. If you do, then find a new job.

Hence an opening  So I say whatever your passion is go for it and join a community that supports it etc you are not only having fun doing what you love but also expanding your social circle.   But the best part is, Just simply Be Yourself"
singapore,3dxt50,merovign,2,Mon Jul 20 16:01:39 2015 UTC,"I suggest you could start with changing this aspect of knowing girls so you can date them. Why not befriend the ladies first then realizing hey this person is totes cool I shall try to ask her out.  If you do get rejected, don't be sad. Ok yes ofc you'll be sad but heyyy you have friends now aw yeah."
singapore,3dxt50,azmansalleh,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:32 2015 UTC,"What social activities do you do? For most adults, a lot of their new friends/social contacts come from the workplace so if you don't want to date within your workplace, you're already limiting yourself pretty hard.    The most important thing is to go out there and present yourself. It's like marketing, if no one knows this product is out there, no one will want to buy it.   That being said, I don't think online dating really works very well in Singapore. You can try but back when I tried it, using OKC, I found that there was too much talking online and not enough meetings IRL."

singapore,3dxt50,GunkyEnigma,9,Tue Jul 21 06:14:11 2015 UTC,"Well,   Stop jerking off - feel the urge to become the best version of yourself and to go out and meet girls. /r/nofap and /r/pornfree for 90 days and above to break free of the chains of these nasty habits that dulls your drive and senses, after which, feel free to enjoy them in moderation. Eat well and start working out start small don't burn out - chisel away and sculpt the physical image you want to portray; on top of that, enjoy the flood of feel-good chemicals and testosterone boost. /r/keto and /r/bodyweightfitness are my personal choices, there's also /r/fitness, /r/kettlebell/, /r/paleo, and many more. Start dressing well - no, I don't mean expensive brands and flashy/douchey stuff, fit is king and learn to color-coordinate. /r/malefashionadvice, and don't forget to groom well too /r/malehairadvice /r/wicked_edge. Get a few shirts and pants tailored if it that's what your wear for work and if your wallet allows it, off-the-rack stuff is b-fucking-s. Meditate - while you work on upgrading your hardware, consider giving the software/os the metaphorical scandisk/defrag/reformat. Outer and inner changes are way more interdependent than most people realise. Educate yourself - update your mindset and patch those bugs that are holding you back. I recommend The Daygame Podcast and Models by Mark Manson for starters (I personally wouldn't /r/seduction and /r/theredpill, but they're substantial resources nonetheless, tread with caution.) Go out and be prepared to get rejected for another and another and another couple of times - Thrill of the chase, baby. Thrill of the chase. Embrace and enjoy your personal transformation - the last thing you need is to dread this whole process.   Source: I came from computer/IT background too when I was young, so, yea.

I get that it helps change people for the better, especially if its chronic and they can't help but jack off all the time. Otherwise, not fapping at all is a little extreme.  It definitely is important that you cut down on jacking off and relying less on porn, but cutting it out completely is ridiculous IMO."
singapore,3dxt50,CaiPngIsLife,0,Mon Jul 20 15:47:08 2015 UTC,"I just edited my post though.  Not gonna argue, but have you tried it before? Have you ever felt like a shaken up and pressurized bottle of male hormones?  In my experience, it's agonizing, yes; but after the said 90-100 days, you will feel liberated. And do not forget the acuity of your senses during that period.  From the bottom of my heart, I encourage you to give it a shot (no pun intended) for two weeks, then ""reward"" yourself, feel the dulling effect of said reward immediately set in. Then you will get what I mean."
singapore,3dxt50,GunkyEnigma,8,Mon Jul 20 15:56:10 2015 UTC,"I've actually given it a shot, and I really never noticed much of a difference in the acuity of my senses, or anything much actually. The only thing that was definite to me was a sense of pointless frustration. I don't know, maybe it just doesn't work for me.  Maybe there is a difference if you don't masturbate but I feel just as alert, motivated and clear headed with a good night's rest and a decent diet and some exercise.  Maybe if you're a student who stays up late every night and eats a couple of shitty meals a day, cutting out masturbation might help you get the ball rolling. After all, it is an exercise in discipline. However, if you're living your life well, there really isn't a point.   That's my opinion anyway. I would love to see proper scientific literature backing up nofap but until I've seen some I'm just going to stick with moderation, not abstinence."
singapore,3dxt50,Pinkpotatopew,5,Mon Jul 20 16:05:26 2015 UTC,"The only thing nofap ever did for me was make wet dreams a thing again. No thanks, I'd rather offload at a time and place of my choosing than wake up to HAHA BITCH FUCK YOU IT'S LAUNDRY TIME."
singapore,3dxt50,GunkyEnigma,-2,Mon Jul 20 16:42:53 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's my final pitch.  Fapping floods your brain with the same/similar reward chemicals as getting laid, nofap forces you to go cold turkey on this reward cycle, so you're forced to seek that out from somewhere else (i.e. girls). It eliminates the only thing you can fall back on when your body and brain craves for these shiok chemicals.  Fapping reinforces the concept in your brain that you can always enjoy these I-just-had-sex chemicals at the comfort of your own room, and that's simply not where the girls are at (unless you first go out and bring her back).  But hey, guess what? Your thread, your life, have fun with that."

Don't meet up with a gril with the end goal of a relationship.  Instead, treat a gril like every normal person and chat about stuff (school, life, family, etc). Go with the flow and whatever comes to mind as you start the conversation.   And, ffs bring her out for a dinner somewhere nice so y'all could have a nice talk 1-on-1.

Think in Uni level it may be differ as long as the prof doesn't teach You? I maybe wrong. And a teacher and student relationship is often frowned upon because a teacher is seen as the more mature and stable and dating a student would be like a violation of trust as the students are often viewed as vulnerable ones."

Can't even begin the count the number of times people don't signal and make a lane change last minute and expect you to give way.  HELLO IF YOU SIGNALED I WOULD KNOW.   I really try my best to be the most courteous driver I can as I used to believe that kindness and graciousness goes both ways. But after driving for 7 years here, I have come to realize the fucking mental attitude of drivers is just so terrible I don't know if it will ever change. It was just douchebag express for me this morning, so I had to rant. Sorry."

I've realised it's not worth it to get angry over others' bad road manners though, kills my brain cells and makes me anxious and rage. What you're describing is partly a consequence of other motorists' ungracious ways (speeding up to prevent others from changing lanes) anyway.  What works for me is I imagine that the person is an old relative of mine and just let it go, ""It's ok la, he's old and probably senile."" The reason why I can do that is because people like my 75 year-old uncle and my dad actually drive like that sometimes themselves, so it's not a stretch to imagine.  Driving etiquette of the nation is not something we can do much to change immediately, just need to learn to handle the rage. I find it's really not that bad once you're more zen-like about it."

I thought maybe I could share it with you awesome people. hahah. I don't know how well the response is... I don't even know if anyone would read this but I just need to get it off my chest. ): and i dont think this deserves a thread on its own so I'm just gonna post here.  So... I just got out of a bad relationship, and I'm telling myself to not go into anymore relationship until after NS, or even until after Uni. But there's this girl... We are friends since sec sch and we're currently in the same clique now, but we've been going out quite often, just the two of us. When I was still in my relationship, we do text each other, but not very often. At most, one day out of a week to catch up. But ever since I broken up, we've been texting more, to the point whereby we text everyday.   The thing is, we really do have alot in common. Music, movies, travelling... we even have plans for the future, like how she would open a bar/cafe and I would be her Friday night live band, and how she would help me shoot and edit a cover video for me, and how we could jam together after she learns guitar and vocals from me. We could even go travelling together because we both want to visit the same places and do the same things.   Recently we've been going out a few times.. for shopping, movies, dinner and whatnot. And most of the time I just want her to be happy. I want to make her laugh. I want to cheer her up when she's down. And when we're out, sometimes there's silence, and she would use her phone and scroll through Twitter or Instagram, and that...worries me. I worry that I'm boring her and stuff like that.   All these scares me.. It scares me to think that I might be falling for her. Don't get me wrong... she is awesome. I wouldn't mind her to be my girlfriend. Her personality is sort of what I'm looking for as well. But the thing is, we are close friends... and I wouldn't want to lose her as a friend if anything goes wrong. And also, due to some personal issues, we can't be together.   So nowadays, I keep telling myself, 'we're just friends. Don't think too much. She probably treats you as a close friend only.' I honestly don't think she will like me because I don't think I'm the kind of guy she's looking for. She needs someone who can really give her a sense of security... I don't think I can give her that. Nowadays when we texts, her replies are little bit cold. Like, in the past whenever the convo was dying, she would start a new topic. Now, she just lets it die. Maybe it's better this way. hahah.   I know... this is so secondary school. Being someone who likes to bottle up his troubles, I don't really have any close friends to talk to. At least behind a screen, I'm anonymous. I'm not asking for advice or anything. I just need a listening ear. I'm sorry if the whole post is so all over the place. hahah.   Thank you for your time, if you have read the whole thingy. Really appreciate it... (:"

singapore,3dzy29,dingjer,2,Mon Jul 20 22:48:23 2015 UTC,Ask the pharmacist for generics. They will be able to tell you whether the pharmacy sticks them. Pro tip: usually orchard area or pharmacies at mrt stations will price the medication at a more expensive price due to rent and availability/late night services of pharmacist. Try to buy them at neighbourhood malls instead.

You can also take the linkway from Pavilion to head to KLCC ( (where the twin towers is at).

singapore,3dyf19,loonylovegood,24,Mon Jul 20 16:19:56 2015 UTC,"I don't really think so. I think people nowadays have unrealistic expectations. And sorry to say this but Singaporean girls in general are pretty... close minded if they aren't attracted to you. It's like asking them on a date is asking them to get married/be your girlfriend. I've been out on a Valentine's Day date with a platonic friend who's Vietnamese and she's much more open to that sort of thing. We're still just friends and I ask her out for 1-on-1 dates sometimes just to have a meal and talk or catch a movie.  Tried that with one of my Singaporean female friend and she told me she was ""uncomfortable"" after the date and avoided me a while. Like, get over yourself.  P.S. Not trying to imply all Singaporean girls are like these, may be just the ones I chase ._."

singapore,3dyf19,iwantsmoothballs,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:16:31 2015 UTC,Everyone has options. Girls have the options to go with someone else. Guys have the options to go with other people as well.
singapore,3dyf19,evilplushie,10,Tue Jul 21 03:35:24 2015 UTC,"Look at the sad ""PM me"" thread for a reality check on how many more options the average girl has than her male counterpart."
singapore,3dyf19,iwantsmoothballs,8,Tue Jul 21 03:38:56 2015 UTC,"There was a study done by either OkCupid or tinder that found out that the most attractive men receive like 90% of all likes while for females it was spread pretty evenly in spite of attractiveness.   The idea that you have a whole sea of men waiting for you to choose from is actually detrimental for female's chances at romantic relationships. It creates this unrealistic idea that you can 'hold out' and select the top 10% of most attractive males because your selection is soooo large, when in reality the top 10% most attractive males are receiving way more female attention than you are receiving male attention. Rather than being a choice you pick from, the most attractive males have you permanently classified as an option rather than a priority.  There's an article I read somewhere that discusses romance from the perspective of assertiveness using a game theory analysis of 3 men and 3 women, with the conclusion that if you passively participate in the dating game i.e. Waiting for people to chase you, there is a very low chance of you ending up with your 1st or 2nd choice compared to if you actively did the chasing. And since women traditionally do the 'waiting', they are perpetually at a disadvantage when it comes to getting their ideal partner and the scariest thing is that they don't realise this; in part thanks to technology allowing them the illusion of a large pool of potential partners, in part thanks to expectations that males are to be assertive and women are given the 'advantage' of selecting from them.   I'll try and dig out the articles and studies and link them when I'm home.  Edit: grammar  Studies in question: Tinder attractiveness study, Tinder 10/10 male study, OKCupid male vs female study  I give up, I can't find the game theory article, but doing research I managed to find the mathematical problem it's modelled after, it's known as the Stable Marriage Problem."

singapore,3dyf19,burstapart,6,Tue Jul 21 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"I always thought Singaporean guys were this way too (averse to the idea of just dating). Especially in school, where everyone hangs out in groups or is in a long term relationship, and it's hard to be just friends with a guy. I think it's different now, but definitely throughout JC that was the case, and a lot of the attitudes stuck.   I also think a lot of it comes from cultural expectations. Like during JC orientation, all the girls were pulled aside for a session on stuff like school rules for girls, and they spent 5-10 minutes telling us not to lead the guys on. So when a guy I wasn't into asked me for a movie I thought we were just hanging out, because we were classmates and had texted a bit. Then I realised it was a date (he tried to pay, a weird amount of casual touching, and most people know I don't like being touched) in my head I was like ""ABORT, ABORT"" and I avoided him after that. I'm pretty ashamed about it and I cringe at the memory now, but back then it was a genuine oh shit I thought we were just friends what does he want from me?!? moment."
singapore,3dyf19,dashrandom,4,Tue Jul 21 04:24:19 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, from your description of the incident, ABORT ABORT was probably the right reaction... :/ I don't think any touching is appropriate unless you're really close to the person.   Hope it doesn't scare you off tho, don't let a few bad apples spoil the entire basket for you. Guys also tend to be more mature as they grow up (some never mature at all but you'll learn the warning signs as you meet more)."
singapore,3dyf19,burstapart,2,Tue Jul 21 04:30:27 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we were already friends, I was just really surprised. I haven't been scared off or anything, and mostly I think we were both kinda naive at that time. I was just trying to explain where the close-mindedness of Singaporean girls came from, and that I always got the vibe that Singaporean guys were similarly close-minded."
singapore,3dyf19,dashrandom,0,Tue Jul 21 05:00:41 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't anyhow touch someone I considered to be just a friend unless we're really close, just saying. The most would be a hand on their waist or holding their shoulder if they're about to get themselves killed by walking too slowly while crossing the road / about to walk into traffic.   To be honest, I don't really see the comparison of the close-mindedness you're talking about with the example you quoted... The guy was interested in you and there was a misunderstanding with regards to the relationship. How is that close-minded? If you're referring to the insistence that he pay and the inappropriate touching, would you be bothered if it was someone you considered to be partner-material?"
singapore,3dyf19,burstapart,3,Tue Jul 21 05:38:59 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't explain myself well enough - the incident got weird because I assumed he was close-minded, because I feel like a lot of the guys I hang out with think that way. In your initial comment you mentioned that girls are close-minded and if they're not interested they'll avoid you, rather than being open to more dates, so I was trying to show why that mindset might come about. In my case I thought he was looking for something serious immediately, because that happened to be the case for a lot of people I know who are already friends, and I definitely wasn't, causing me to shut off immediately, because the fear of leading a guy on had been drilled into me. Who knows what it would've been like if the guy was partner material? I'm inclined to say the same thing would've happened, because I really wasn't interested in anything at that time, but I really don't know. Which is why in hindsight I know it was an asshole move - we could totally have remained friends if I hadn't reacted badly and been upfront about being uninterested, and maybe feelings would've developed, or maybe they wouldn't while he continued to expect a full-on relationship, and as I feared I'd get shit for leading him on.   Sorry for the wall of text, I feel like I'm being defensive or something, but I'm really not, just trying to explain that close-mindedness of both genders is this weird cycle that feeds itself because people can be shitty about communicating. Like you said, I definitely think it's a maturity thing on both sides."
singapore,3dyf19,dashrandom,2,Tue Jul 21 06:05:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response it was great to hear your side of the story.  And I've gotta say it feed back in to the guys. I had a very close female friend do this (and worse) to me. I swear I was a perfect gentleman but she bolted like a cat. Despite my reassurances that I was ok staying platonic she started behaving, to put it mildly, in a very hostile manner. We are no longer friends.  When a guy gets a response like that - he's going to think twice about making a move the next time.  Having grown up around girls like that - I'm always very careful before I make a move, and even when it's all green lights and I decide to (rarely, like in the above case) I get shitscared it's going to end in disaster. And sometimes it actually does.  Like that with Amber lights I wouldn't dare to take a chance."
singapore,3dyf19,damnsadnewman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:11:41 2015 UTC,"Ahh, no need to feel sorry, you're definitely making things clearer with this comment. It's more of an explanation than a defensive reaction, no worries ;) Yeah I see where you're coming from now.  But based on your explanation it seems to be more of a societal thing than a maturity thing since it seems that you're socialised to possess this sort of expectation as to how to act given that situation. It's interesting to hear from the other gender as well.   Yeah needless to say though, it's actually good that you recognise there's an undue amount of paranoia associated with the dating game from the female side. Don't let it ruin your friendships! Me and that female friend who acted weird are to say the least, not all close now partially because of that incident (and some other stuff I discovered later on but that was basically the catalyst). If the guy's a good friend, sit down and talk to him like an adult. I'm sure most guys would appreciate that approach rather than  being ignored / avoided."
singapore,3dyf19,dashrandom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:11:42 2015 UTC,This.  Very hard to ask a girl out on a date when she thinks it means it's something really serious.  Makes it hard to get a date with a girl because it immediately jumps to something so high pressured
singapore,3dyf19,t0nberry87,0,Tue Jul 21 10:02:11 2015 UTC,"to me, its great that woman reject a man up straight, rather then excuses. the lady who reject you is pretty good in knowing what she wants. i mean, i rather to get rejected by her, let her know we still can be friends and go for other woman then wait for ages and she finally tell me she didnt like me and hate her for aeons.  and i agree with that folks have unrealistic expectations, that include you. you expected something from the date else you wouldnt commented this lady. that something was that you like her and chased her.  come on, got rejected is fine, everyone been through stuff like that always!"
singapore,3dyf19,dashrandom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:42:27 2015 UTC,"Bro, this person was my friend for over 5 years, I was in uni with her. I only started being interested in her after she actually started to be in control of her life and not wasting it away and not having learnt shit at the end of every term and forever complaining to me about it.  Just over the fact that I wanted to chase her, we're practically not friends any more now. If I knew that was the result, I would've preferred to stay silent. You're right, I have expectations. I have expectations that if she is not attracted to me at all, she sit down and have a talk with me like an adult and we go back to being friends.  Your attempt to put others down and appear greater than them is amusing."

singapore,3dyf19,evilplushie,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:56 2015 UTC,"I don't quite agree with you. Most of my closer friends are female and basically from their accounts, they have no problems with male platonic friends. It's just that a lot of males start to creep them out by trying to chase them after pretending to be platonic! So now you ask, why do girls get creeped out? It's quite the natural defence mechanism because they have a lot to lose. Even guys get creeped out when a hypothetical stalker with BO crazy girl stalks them.  You yourself said ""the ones I chase"" so you were going out with them with the intention of chasign them but you advertised it as being platonic. SG girls are actually really open in general compared to girls in many other Asian countries. But it also depends on the group you hang out with, ""SG girl"" is not a uniform group."
singapore,3dyf19,evilplushie,6,Tue Jul 21 06:51:36 2015 UTC,"It's just that a lot of males start to creep them out by trying to chase them after pretending to be platonic!   That's the thing, I'm not pretending to be a friend. I am a friend first and I may or may not develop feelings after some time. Is it that unthinkable that a platonic friend sees you in a different light after some time or after learning more about you? People change, it works both ways.  But it seems from your description that you have this very strict segregation between 'friends' and 'potential partners' i.e. you have a friendzone. I don't immediately classify people into 'hey this girl is totally my type' and 'wow I'd never date this girl' when I meet people. They all fall into a 'this person is pretty cool, let's hang out' category. What happens after that, we'll see. I don't girlfriendzone people, I don't friendzone them either (I've done so in the past but after some time you'll realise that feelings work both ways and some things can be changed).   Also, I'm not sure what you're expecting when you claim that being a platonic friend first is 'pretense'. How would you feel if a stranger just started chasing you out of nowhere? Seems a lot more creepy if you ask me. Do all your relationships start as complete strangers? Or do you know more about each other and be friends first?   P.S. you sound extremely defensive about this whole thing. I've already admitted that not all Singaporean girls may be this way, but I've dated girls of different nationalities and Singaporean girls stand out as the most defensive / willing to forsake the friendship to avoid the awkwardness of having someone you are not attracted to attracted to you."
singapore,3dyf19,evilplushie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:03:06 2015 UTC,Yup. I don't know why girls think like this. I always presumed they prefer to have a friendship first and a romance on top of that.  That's the ideal scenario for me. But I'm a guy so
singapore,3dyf19,evilplushie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:14:11 2015 UTC,"Think it's the idea of love at first sight? If you're not immediately attracted to the person, there's no chance to become attracted to the person?"

I don't blame that they are unable to return my feelings, that's fine. But choosing to ignore and avoid someone just because they have feelings for you despite being friends with them for such a long time, is possibly the most childish, immature thing you can do.  If we talked it over, personally I'd have suggested I cold turkey myself from whoever I was interested in for a while. She doesn't need to do that for me. I'm an adult and I can't control my feelings for someone but I can control my reactions to them."

Because if you a just a nice guy people nowadays are scared of getting stuck in a ""boring family life"".

singapore,3dyf19,GulagAdventures,16,Mon Jul 20 16:30:42 2015 UTC,"It's not a problem endemic to Singapore. Most urban hyper-connected societies are seeing a surfeit of choice, and thus an unwillingness to settle, in the hope there's something better out there.  Aziz Ansari has written about this: in fact this is the whole premise of his book. Here's an excerpt.   Let’s look at how I do things, maybe with a slightly less important decision, like the time I had to pick where to eat dinner in Seattle when I was on tour last year. First I texted four friends who travel and eat out a lot and whose judgment I trust. I checked the website Eater for its Heat Map, which includes new, tasty restaurants in the city. Then I checked Yelp. And GQ’s online guide to Seattle. Finally I made my selection: Il Corvo, an Italian place that sounded amazing. Unfortunately, it was closed. (It only served lunch.) At that point I had run out of time because I had a show to do, so I ended up making a peanut-butter-and-banana sandwich on the bus. The stunning fact remained: it was quicker for my dad to find a wife than it is for me to decide where to eat dinner.  This kind of rigor goes into a lot of my decisionmaking. Whether it’s where I’m eating, where I’m traveling or, God forbid, something I’m buying, like a lot of people in my generation—those in their 20s and 30s—I feel compelled to do a ton of research to make sure I’m getting every option and then making the best choice. If this mentality pervades our decision­making in so many realms, is it also affecting how we choose a romantic partner?   The article, based on this book, here."

Science, homies. No need to go around searching for answers when there's thousands of years of evolution staring at us."
singapore,3dyf19,evilplushie,3,Tue Jul 21 04:57:59 2015 UTC,"Very true. The way nature is designed, women want to mate with the top % of men, but these men will never commit to them or raise their children, because 1) they have so many options, and 2) men dont want to raise other people's kids (cuckoldry).  This is why marriage exists imo. It's a reproductive compromise: The man agrees to help raise the woman's kids, and in return the woman agrees to have only his children. This is why men value youthfulness and beauty in women, and women value economic productiveness, at least when it comes to committed relationships. It all boils down to the success of the offspring.  But recent demographic trends in developed countries have become problematic in this regard. The problems are twofold - One, with increasing numbers of women outearning men, and not wanting to ""settle"" for men who earn less due to hypergamic instincts, and two, men are increasingly not being drawn to women as women push marriage further and further back, losing youth and fertility, there will inevitably be hordes of men and women who end up single. Japan and Germany are two such examples.  There has been a trend of shaming men, calling them shallow for wanting youthfulness in their partners, or irresponsible for not ""stepping up to the plate"". These complaints cannot overwrite (as you said) not only thousands, but hundreds of thousands of years of evolution. The fact is, times have changed, and with it, the traditional marriage contract has been losing its appeal quickly."

singapore,3dyf19,another-work-acct,2,Tue Jul 21 07:04:17 2015 UTC,"Men place emphasis on physical beauty, which is tied to youth. Women tend to favor financial security and social status for LTRs, which means older men, but when it comes to non-commital sex, physical attraction matters.  What this means is that a typical successful older man will not prefer older women, because he isnt getting what he wants, even though the woman may be getting what she wants. This doesn't surprise me at all."

singapore,3dyf19,SnatchThief,4,Tue Jul 21 08:18:45 2015 UTC,How is that realistic. The latest median income for SG households was less than 6k iirc. Maybe even less than 5k.

singapore,3dyf19,SnatchThief,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:03:54 2015 UTC,"All she's asking for is someone who makes a similar salary to her. If it's realistic for her to earn that much, why isn't realistic for him to earn that much? I fail to see the problem here."
singapore,3dyf19,autourbanbot,2,Tue Jul 21 06:31:04 2015 UTC,"I think its more to the fact that she has strict guidelines to what she wants in a partner. Especially since she is single and wants to look for a partner. I'd expect someone who was single to be out there and meeting people, and not having a strict set of criteria."
singapore,3dyf19,Tragic16,2,Tue Jul 21 06:36:07 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's highly recommended by, well, basically everyone who's an expert in such things to have guidelines of what you want and don't want in a partner. You can separate it by requirements, nice to have but not necessary, and dealbreakers (cheating, abuse, drugs, etc.). That way, you are less likely to compromise your own boundaries and end up with someone who treats you badly.  And the woman in this story probably has high standards for herself, too, plus she's perfectly happy to be alone rather than settle for less than she wants. So why shouldn't she have high standards? You're acting like it's a bad thing.  Edit: And, really? (1) Earn a similar salary, (2) not a fucking troll, and (3) not morally bankrupt is what you call ""strict guidelines""? Dang. I'd call that the bare minimum."
singapore,3dyf19,evilplushie,3,Tue Jul 21 06:45:36 2015 UTC,"Sure. I guess that's your opinion, and probably many others as well. I think that having guidelines (such as those stated) may have a negative impact on finding the right partner. Sure, I agree with the idea that you shouldn't get a bum off the streets, but putting a $9k/mth cap on salary earned? I think that just causes blinkers."
singapore,3dyf19,Iheart2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:59:21 2015 UTC,"Well, and that criterion might be a 'negotiable' aspect for her. I can see where she's coming from though. Much like a man who makes a lot of money, she probably doesn't want to have issues with guys who are just using her for her money. Which I understand. I think if I was in that situation, I would just be discreet about how much I make at first, in order to weed out the gold diggers. Then again, maybe she wants someone who can afford to go on vacation and live the same lifestyle she does? It's certainly not a criterion that I need, but we are all different."
singapore,3dyf19,tjhan,2,Tue Jul 21 07:02:54 2015 UTC,"She's probably off just dating in her own industry if she wants people who make the same as her. Statistically, there aren't that many people who make 9,000 in SG a month at 40+ and I have to wonder how many of them are already attached"

singapore,3dyf19,tjhan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:21:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's good to be honest with yourself.  But to publish yourself as a gold digger in a newspaper - makes you unattractive!

singapore,3dyf19,serados,2,Tue Jul 21 08:22:13 2015 UTC,"She's not a gold digger for wanting someone who earns the same amount as her!! It's about wanting someone who has the same earning potential, values, etc. And about not wanting a gold digger to use her."

I know there are some in place, but as someone who was well on her way to acquiring a BTO at 35, the government cannot make me commit to someone for the rest of my life. On a personal level, people need to be realistic.   ""When you're older, you're also more likely to know what you want and less likely to compromise.""   This.  I'd rather be happy alone, than to be unhappy with someone else.  Sure you can say I'm being picky. But I believe in having standards. & hey, if I'm not going to fight for my own happiness, then who will? & we're talking about the rest of your life.  There will always be some compromise. Something that the other party does that you're not 100% ok with. & if it's something you cannot live with, don't waste your time or his/hers. Do not assume the other party will change for you. & of course there'll be something about you that the other person won't be 100% ok with either. & if they expect you to change because of them... Buay steady?  It's not about waiting or looking for someone who's better. It's about waiting or looking for someone who's better for you.  So you gotta ask yourself. If you want to be attached, but you haven’t found a right fit, are you just going to jump into a relationship just because? It’s your life. Your choice. & yes, go ahead & be selfish. But be ready to live with the consequences.  Personally, I chose to be happy on my own, yet remain hopeful. & guess what, it paid off. I just tied the knot with my best friend two weeks ago. (But between you & me, I think he’s compromising more than I am. HAHA.)"
singapore,3dyf19,SnatchThief,2,Tue Jul 21 03:01:16 2015 UTC,"If I understand you correctly: finances are important, but are not at the heart of the problem?  Personally I agree. People of all socioeconomic classes find ways to make things work. Even have many children.  If anything I think the more privileged kids are more sheltered and for some reason more hesitant to throw themselves into the dating pool. From anecdotal experience I don't think it is an issue of putting career ahead of relationships (this is more an issue when it comes to marriage), I think they just haven't been exposed enough to the dating culture and aren't quite sure how to go about it. This aside of the issue of being more picky which I feel is not a bad thing.  But just anecdotal experience from my slice of Singapore.  P.S. Congratulations. Last long long"
singapore,3dyf19,evilplushie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:36:39 2015 UTC,"Finances are only as important as you want them to be. Heck, everything is only as important as you want them to be. For example, I'm 1.73m. Have I dated shorter men? Of course. In fact, I was engaged to one. But if I were to suggest that (date taller woman/shorter man) to some people I know? It'll be like asking them to go copulate with a spider.  I see where you're coming from, but I don't think it's got anything to do with privilege or being exposed to the dating culture. It boils down to priorities really. You write down a list of things you want in a partner, then you rank each quality, whether something is ""DIE DIE MUST HAVE"" or ""chin chai nevermind"".  Come to think of it, it might actually be quite a good exercise. To write down a list. & then go through each item & ask yourself why it's important. Might learn something about yourself.  P.S. Thank you so much! Don't believe in divorce, so I'll do whatever I can to make this work & last long long. =)"
singapore,3dyf19,SnatchThief,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:09:54 2015 UTC,"Haha.  The thing about privilege - think I read that from Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari. Just a thought that came to mind when I saw this discussion. Don't recall the exact details of the study, may or may not apply to Singaporeans.  Priorities - for some it may be a priority but maybe just not experienced and not really shown a way to go about pursuing it actively. May end up in a passive ""wait for something to happen"" mode. But I guess you may see that as not wanting something enough to spend time figuring it out."
singapore,3dyf19,evilplushie,4,Tue Jul 21 11:38:17 2015 UTC,"Something I have noticed, as I´m swedish living in Singapore with a Singaporean girlfriend is that there´s so much ""hush hush"" and the tone is so cold when it comes to relationships.   We Swedes keep to ourselves a bit too, but in Singapore you seem to take it one step further. You don´t talk feelings at all about anything. Unless it´s complaining. God forbid you even mention the word sex or intimacy. It seems such a taboo. God forbid you show any type of feelings in public. Everybody rather seem to care more about if they´re getting HDB, and how many tens of thousands of dollars they are going to waste on their wedding and if their education is good enough.   Where I come from, nobody will judge you if you went drinking for a night and ended up sleeping with a one night stand. I´ve never even heard of such happenings in Singapore. (I´m sure they happen though) For example. So much seems to be too taboo and so serious. You guys need to be more casual about everything. Stop being offended if you see someone giving someone a quick kiss on town. (I´ve been told off by aunties).  Same thing now, I´m moving in to the graduate halls at NTU to because I´m doing my Masters in SG. There's shitloads of rules, but the most strict ones seem to be regarding having visitors of the opposite sex. To me that just showcases the mentality of a lot of people in Singapore.  Who the fuck cares if I have my girlfriend over and we hang out in my room? God forbid we might even have sex? Pretty sure I´d be evicted if I told the administration this. I´ve studied in Sweden for three years, this is how at least some couples meet and get together.  So to make my point short. The attitude I feel sometimes is that it´s so much taboo related to so many parts of the relationship. So much you can´t talk about, so much you can´t show or do outside of your home. Basically just the attitude need to be more casual about everything. And it seems to me that the ethnically chinese, which is the majority of singapore population IIRC, are the worst offenders, or ""strictest"".  How do yuo keep a relationship and how do people meet if there´s such a stigma against so many parts of it and so much else to stress out about?  This is just how I´ve experienced it from the people I´ve met, of course I can be totally off though."
singapore,3dyf19,SnatchThief,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:46:18 2015 UTC,"I agree there's a very stifling climate in Singapore in this aspect compared to Western countries. As a ""herd"" Singaporeans tend to be judgemental, even if individually we do not feel that way. The prevailing culture is very conservative still, and this isn't helped by the nannying the government and our families do constantly.  Though, the rule regarding having visitors of the opposite sex in your dorm room is probably more for the parents' ""peace of mind"", who want some form of assurance the kids aren't screwing around before marriage and remain virtuous or something. It's usually unenforced, but I can see why you may be worried. Heck, plenty of RAs I had had their partners in their rooms without any attempt to hide that, and many of them stayed overnight. Just don't make too much sex noises; you're just being inconsiderate then."
singapore,3dyf19,evilplushie,2,Tue Jul 21 14:28:56 2015 UTC,"Then again, as you say it´s for the ""parent´s peace of mind"" and that they want assurance that the kids aren´t screwing around before marriage. That´s the attitude issue I´m feeling. Here parents are more towards ""Well, please just use protection, we don´t want grandchildren yet"".   I´m not saying a relationship is just screwing around, but when you´re in your young twenties, at least in Sweden that´s a pretty big part of it. If parents are very ""strict"" with what they allow their kids to do and not to do before marriage, at least to me there would be the element of being a good kid and I wouldn´t date around as much. Everything is so serious."
singapore,3dyf19,SnatchThief,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:11:07 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. I wouldn't exactly call it a stigma or taboo, but it's pretty damn close to one.  It's just seen as something very private. I wish the culture were more casual about it.  If this really is the problem - how do we solve it? How can we change our culture?"
singapore,3dyf19,evilplushie,6,Tue Jul 21 14:44:18 2015 UTC,"In an echo to what /u/rindojustrindo pointed out, with better education we are also provided with more options and choices. But too much options actually only serves to paralyze. We spend more time choosing and finding the right partner than focusing on what it means to BE the right partner.   What this means is that we spend very little time on making the relationship work and more time looking at what others have. Contentment is basically thrown out the window.  At the same time, what /u/singapuracat said is true as well. When our ""leaders"" constantly set an example of how $$ is important, the policies shows that as well and everyone else gets trapped in putting finances (be it salary income, having enough money)  as a high priority. We all end up marrying later because everyone feels they don't have enough money or stable enough yet to get married."

Ok lah actually I've always admired photography and there's always those few years where I try to do something interesting once in a while but never really got to it proper. Been using my sister's underutilised D3100 to shoot just for leisure and my own fun. My flickr is relatively new too and I haven't had time to go home to upload my newer pictures. The newer stuff are on my Instagram, I'll PM if anyone is interested though (ugh, I don't really want to spill my reddit life elsewhere since my instagram is more of a pseudo-personal/photography account).   But nonetheless, yeah. Hope I can get some critiques and suggestions. Been reading into different styles of photography lately, like still life, street and long exposures. Hopefully I'll be able to pull it off someday!  https://m.flickr.com/#/photos/129615988@N07/sets/"

singapore,3dyyqr,sn_zy,2,Tue Jul 21 04:16:58 2015 UTC,Another word of advice - if you're shooting street or events you won't have much time to think of balance or proportion or lines. The more important thing is to be ready  and in the right spot when something interesting happens. Practise loads with your camera and have an instinctive feel of what settings are most suitable in a situation. Experience will be your greatest asset!
singapore,3dyyqr,DanialAnton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:18:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I find that street is generally about reflexes and being observant of one's surroundings. I'm trying to practice how to switch my settings accordingly for the suitable places and shots. Thank you very much for the advise!"

I don't give a shit if she consented to it, she just became a teenager, who the fuck knows how to have safe, consensual sex at 13, or how does she know how to say no to someone she knows and trusts? Her godfather is supposed to protect her, and he betrayed her trust. Same with her godfather's 'friend'. What is this bullshit you're spewing?  Also, you're not Batman or any other superhero.

I've been teaching students with issues and in most cases the child has no guidance that tells the right from wrong. As much as I want to consider her a jailbait, but I would not because she's been steered in that direction."

Yeah she may have been willing to fuck him, but, newsflash, 13 year olds are not good at making life choices, there's a reason why we have a minimum age of consent when it comes to sex, there is a huge power imbalance between a teenager and an adult.   The blame lies with the adults who thought it'd be peachy keen to fuck a 13 year old.   Op, hope you never have to teach a kid in a similar predicament to this kid. Hate to see what sort of advice you'd give her, ""yeah it's your fault for having sex with an adult that your godfather (who groomed you) pimped you too. Take some responsibility in your choices 13 year old!"""

singapore,3e1ilv,moleskines,8,Tue Jul 21 15:11:25 2015 UTC,"It isn't her fault. She is 13. It's no one's fault but the rapists, because at the age of 13, she sure doesn't know wrong from right. Would you not listen to someone you trust and know when you're that young? They're adults, and she's barely a teenager. I hope you're not telling your students they're in the wrong when they come to you about issues concerning non consensual or coerced sex, because rape is NEVER the victim's fault, not even if they're naked, barely clothed, or in the middle of intercourse when they decide they want to stop."
singapore,3dxjta,karttiao,22,Mon Jul 20 10:40:03 2015 UTC,"What is an integrated shield plan, and what has changed?  As you most likely already know, the Integrated Shield plan is made up of 2 parts: the basic Medishield coverage, and additional coverage provided by your insurance company. The new Medishield Life will affect the Medishield portion, so that if you ever drop your IS plan, you will still have the new coverage.  Most prominently, because of the ""upgrade"", any pre-existing condition not covered by the insurer will be covered under Medishield Life.  But my premiums??  From the website,   The IP insurers have committed to keeping premiums for the additional private insurance coverage portion of all IPs unchanged for a year after implementation of MediShield Life.   After the 1 year (end-2016), premiums will probably go up.  Why they do dis?!  There's a lot of old and sick people. Old and sick people need more coverage - lots of 'pre-existing' conditions not covered when signing for an insurance plan. Medishield needs to be self-sustaining. So, the solution is to provide increased coverage, and charge healthy working folk more in return. Much like income tax.  Walao eh. No benefit for me then??  Depends. The new integrated shield plans that are coming out next year will have bonus features like 1) clearer premium and withdrawal amounts so there's standardization and clarity (and yes they literally use the word 'clarity' - thanks Rito!) and 2) increased withdrawal limits so you can use Medisave to pay for part of your insurance premiums, on top of Medishield.  This only applies to new plans starting in 2016, or plans recontracting in 2016.  Knn eh so actually no benefit la!  Well... CPF sent around letters to people eligible for subsidies, asking them to confirm personal particulars so they can hand out subsidies when the plan comes into effect. So it's possible that with the subsidies, your premium will end up lower.  Also, employers are contributing 1 percentage point more to Medisave than last year. If you're 55 and up you also get 1 percentage point more because of this year's Budget!  Otherwise, if you're young, healthy and earning 3k+/mo, sorry, you're shit outta luck."

Relevant statements about his difficulty as a model in Singapore:   Of the failures he faced while he was modelling in Singapore, Chua lamented that the market here ""wasn't very local-friendly"".  ""In this industry, rejections are very common. You can go for 10 castings and get 10 rejections,"" he said.  ""But the Singapore market doesn't use many locals in the fashion shows. Sometimes, they don't cast us the moment they know we are local. It's a sad thing to know.""   About the fashion industry in Singapore:   [Fashion consultant and show producer Daniel] Boey agreed: ""In our industry, it's very hard for clients to accept that there are Singaporean models.  ""You should book a model because he looks good, not book him based on what country he's from...   ...Andee's advantage is that he is dark, so he can pass off as native American, or South Asian, which is good."""

Preference for a certain kind of look in an industry highly dependent on image can't be compared to the more overt discrimination in recruitment or in rental ads. Still, there is a rising trend in Asian countries where models are chosen for their ""aspirational"" value, rather than relatable value.   This post about white obsession in India touches upon this: local models are chosen for relatable things like food, detergent or insurance, while foreign (more particularly white) models are chosen for brands that wish to be perceived as international. This is indicative of the Asiatic region actually, where the beautiful white archetype is held as the beauty ideal, regardless of skin tone and body type in the region.  It's not motivated by a delusional sense of superiority over - or an irrational hatred of - a certain section of people, but by institutions' and brands' need to be seen as valuable and chic in a society that prizes a certain kind of beauty well above their own. This ""preference"" denies opportunities to home-grown talent, and in my book, it is discrimination."

singapore,3dzarl,ohnhs,4,Mon Jul 20 19:16:00 2015 UTC,"Did telemarketing a few years back. Same situation as you, looking for work while studying. Worked 4 months before re-evaluating my sanity.  All I gotta say is that it's an extremely hard job. Get ready to be rejected for calling people throughout the day. The problem is that you are calling homes during working hours when no one is home, or you are calling people who are at work. Both scenarios only lead to either the person not being who you want to contact, or the person just hangs up on you.   People in Singapore are actually pretty alright, only 1 in 50 will abuse you verbally. But, its the 1 in 50 who gets to you really. You cannot hang up on them, that's the problem, you are told to wait for them to finish abusing you out of fear of getting a complaint. The rest either hangs up, or listens to you drone on and on about your product before declining.   The office was also run down, I did not even have a computer. Just cubicle, in a windowless room, with one phone, my database, and a pencil. I did one project for insurance, and managed to get 5 people after 3 months lol.   The company I worked for did not just do telemarketing though. We had surveys and stuff as well. We had some government contracts, so those were the easiest to handle. Just say I'm representing the government agency and everyone panics and becomes your friend.  My advice. Don't."
singapore,3dzarl,mhawks,3,Tue Jul 21 02:35:48 2015 UTC,"What kind of people work as telemarketers?   ... wat.jpg  It's just a job. As with any job, you'll get all kinds of people. Not sure what you're asking here..."
singapore,3dzarl,dashrandom,2,Tue Jul 21 02:32:38 2015 UTC,"You need to be able to put up with countless rejections as you start out as a telemarketer. Learn to deal with rejection and not to take it personally.  Based on my experience, I feel that females generally (or any person with a friendly female voice) get the attention they want from making cold calls, though at times this could warrant unwanted attention too. Let's just say I had a female colleague who chanced upon a client who decided to, on the sidelines of insurance talk, ask her about sexual services.  It's going to be really tough especially if you're working for commission and/or to achieve a quota. But it's also tough because there's something really demoralizing, of course, about having to face a huge pile of names and numbers belonging to people whom you don't know and plough your way through the endless litany in order to secure appointments and whatnot.  Now that the PDPA and DNC registry are in effect, you're going to be facing more people who might adopt a hostile reaction to telemarketing calls. These weren't in place when I was working as a telemarketer, but there were then already people who demanded on the phone that their names be removed from the database.  You'll need to be able to speak well and carry an effective conversation on the phone with strangers. A glib tongue will help a lot in your attempts to make small talk before getting to business. So to answer your question of ""what kind of people work as telemarketers"", allow me to take the liberty to correct it as ""what kind of people could work as telemarketers"", and I can tell you, well, if you're persuasive and can speak well, telemarketing can help you earn quick bucks.  You'll also need to possess genuine and comprehensive interest in whatever you're selling; sounding clueless or constantly saying ""I'll have to consult my manager on this"" whenever your information is being questioned is not going to help you get results.  Pro tip: If you're given lists of names and numbers, tackle the foreign sounding names first. Foreigners tend to be less cynical and more open to conversation.  P.S. Oh ya if you ever do get a sales script at your workplace (that is if you ever do get into it), you can consider throwing it away. There's no one hard and fast rule to which you can adhere in speaking to your prospective clients on the phone. It's a highly volatile job and you need to change your script as and when the situation changes."

It was apparently from a company either marketing or publishing the popular Singapore Ghost Stories.  So, we were briefed about the latest book and then given a list of names/telephone numbers to call them and promote the book and ask if they want or not.  To me, it was quite easy, u sit down there for 2 hours, they provide the phone. Just call, chit chat, sell them how interesting the new book is and if they agree, put a tick in your listing.  At the end of the day, u get paid some fixed $$ per hour + commission. I remember i got quite good conversion rates. I was even given the book to go home and read to 'sell better'.  After 1 night, i think telemarketing is not my cuppa tea, seems like just using your charm to get the other party to agree to buy something over the 3 min conversation. I was also too lazy to return the book, so in the end i called back to say i quit (without collecting a single cent in-lieu of not returning the book)."

No only that, sending thousands of able working adults would not only hurt the government's pocket but also the economy.   Now what about the major uploaders? The problem is that anyone can be an uploader, and that even though you catch the uploader, stuff online is there and still torrenting, which doesn't really help, sure you halt the production but it's temporary. I'm not saying an uploader is practically safe but they are generally safer.   Both economically and work wise, the best way to stop torrentors is to take down the website, torrent basically work with a small code that request for the data, take that down, you stop people from ever torrenting.

Do research on topics that hover around your course of study (For example, if you are going for a DPA interview in aerospace engineering, be prepared to be asked questions like your future career aspirations in the aerospace industry, and also questions related to the course of study such as the materials used in aircraft construction etc. I'm not sure what business/humanities/life science/IT DPA students get asked though.)   They might also ask about your mid year or prelim results. Questions may range from why your English grade is not that good, why you are applying for a life science course (example) when your chemistry results aren't good. They will also ask what measure are you going to take to improve your results. Of course, if you have maintained stellar academic results consistently then questions regarding your results shouldn't pose that much of a problem to you.  Oh yeah, the projects/competitions that you have done that is related. They will ask about it.  I can't really remember any other details of the interview as I had it almost 4 years ago.

Internship is a semester long and it is at the last semester of the final year. So technically we have 5 semesters and the grading you get in internship will not affect your Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). By going into either Media and Communications (DMC) or Creative Writing (DTVM) you can pick up this special Diploma-plus program that is only available to these two courses on 'Digital Film'.  DTVM is course that teaches you to make stories/content for various media. 3 years of DTVM can be summarizes as: Dream it, Write it, Make it. In year one you learn the basic of telling story, while year 2 you learn the different kinds of storytelling and year 3 you learn how to make your stories real (execution with budgeting etc.). The only written exam is the Media Law and Ethics at year 3 but this course is really crazy with deadlines. This course is pretty interest and in year 3 you get thrown into another country for On-Location Production where you are put to the test with everything you learn to execute a project (e.i. budgeting, face-to-cam). Potential internship location are: Today Paper (SPH), CNA (Mediacorp), Asian Food Channel, Fox International, Prime Minister Office and some other government offices, Asian Geographic and the list goes on. Pretty interesting course if you ask me.  DMC is slightly different from the Mass Communication in TP and NP, DMC trains you in advertising, pitching an idea. There are some Psych modules but they are not very thorough about it as compared to my course. There are 3 year long modules if i am not wrong such as Visual Communication where you learn about typography and drawing logo etc. I'm not sure about internship placing but you can try doing some digging on the internet or asking someone.  Make sure you know which one you want more and come into the interview with an open mind to things. I had very little drama experience and was very inhibited at the start of the interview and it's okay to not know what you exactly want to do in the future. They let me in because I showed that I am willing to try new things and do my best at it. All the best with your interview! Keep us posted about the result yea! :)"

I'm both excited and afraid.   To be honest, it would be great if I wasn't diagnosed as depressed, but at the same time it would suck because I completely invalid my secondary school life and I have to find another reason why I behaved/felt that way.   I hope it goes well.   EDIT:  So I've finally seen the psychiatric and am declared not suffering from any mental disorder. Which is great actually, but I still don't feel right. Apparently he, his reasoning why is that because I am really different from other people that it is affecting me causing depression like symptom. Overall, I am perfectly fine, but I must learn how to keep myself happy, surround myself with people that care and have hobbies and basically keep doing what I've been doing in the past year lately.   I would t be spring back into a elevated sense of happiness anytime soon (since we both concluded that people at school seems to be causing my problems) but slow & steady seems to be the best way to get me back on track."

Remember that the presence or absence of a diagnosis has no impact on what you know you are experiencing + to take care of yourself either way. I was never given a formal diagnosis but I definitely had some dark times - working based on the assumption that i was probably at least somewhat depressive i was able to seek help and read up on resources and treat (not medically - I mean in terms of behavior etc.) myself in a way that contributed to my recovery."

The only other tablet that's better in this aspect is probably the Wacom Companion.  The Surface Pro 3's pressure sensitivity is awesome and adjustable.

singapore,3dvkrq,rindojustrindo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:16:58 2015 UTC,"I've used a wacom Intuos (then called Bamboo) for a number of years before moving to the iPad. Drawing on the iPad is great, but the tools I use are relatively simplistic: Procreate is amazing, but still I'd like a full-on Photoshop suite. Also, capacitive touch is a little limited in some things (like drawing hair).  What I need now is a draw-on-surface device with an active digitizer. The Wacom Companion, the Cintiq are just way above my price range for a peripheral device, which is why I've been looking for laptop alternatives. I've zeroed in on the HP Spectre 360 and the Dell Inspiron 7000 series, both which have a Synaptics digitizer (as compared to the N-trig on Surface, and the proprietary digitizer on wacom devices). Synaptics digitizers seem alright but not as close as wacoms get.  At this point, I have to say that I'm no art professional, but just a hobbyist who's kinda tired of drawing on a surface that is not the screen. Hence all the grief about whether to spend 1.5K on a laptop for drawing, or for a (admittedly awesome) tablet that's about 1.2K with limited storage.  I'm leaning towards a whole new laptop because it's about time I replaced mine from the stone age. ARRGH TOO MANY PARAMETERS"

In most places in Singapore the prices are fixed, so haggling isn't commonplace as it is in other SEA countries. Near Mustafa is also City Square Mall, which as an NTUC you can also check out (and also a number of eateries, which you can take a look around, they're mostly 10-50$ range).  There's also a store called Daiso there, which sells Japanese products all at 2$ a pop. It's worth checking out if you're in the area! I usually buy face towels, wet tissues, fabric gloves, small plastic storage and file folders from them. Also there's a department store called Metro there if you need more stuff, though prices are for the most part more expensive than Mustafa."
singapore,3dvkrq,fanofippo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:08:24 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Singapore and glad to see you are settling in! Enjoy the Mustafa shopping experience! No haggling required.  It's worth it to try the eateries around the Mustafa Centre, lots of nice indian cuisine there."

Most online blogs (e.g. expat websites) recommend engaging a tenant's agent to assist with searching and completing the rental agreement.  We called an agent that was recommended to us, but so far he has not been helpful at all (he doesn't seem to know the area too well, so far he showed us one place that did not meet our requirements at all, making the process somewhat slow, etc). We did not sign a contact with him or anyone else.  Do we have any obligation to this agent? Can we just tell him ""thanks but no thanks"" and part ways, or are we stuck either legally or ethically with him now?  Also, are tenant's agents really that necessary? We plan to rent something <$3000 per month, so we would have to pay them, but it doesn't seem like they are doing anything at all to deserve the commission.  Thanks for the help!"

singapore,3dvunn,rheologian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:30:16 2015 UTC,imo it's very easy to get full rides (= you pay nothing so you're not dependent on parents) to state universities in the US.  but that depends on OP's unstated academic capabilities. so study hard! (PM me for more specific advice on eg the SATs)
singapore,3dvunn,guoshe,11,Mon Jul 20 17:08:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly as long its with your parents consent, even if you don't finish O's but take SATs or ACTs, you can still study in the US but most likely in a community college. Although most unis admission req includes O's & maybe even A's.  I just went to an overseas education fair over the weekend because I want to head to the US as well, and that's where the info came from. And like someone pointed out, you need adequate funding as well & demonstrate w the relevant financial documents..  *Edit: if you're thinking about scholarships / financial aid its also hard to apply as an international student. Even for stuff like company-sponsored scholarships with bonds, the ones i know require you to BE already studying overseas at least for a semester before you're able to apply...  At first my mom was against heading abroad to study, but after the education fair, she was more open to it cos of how liberal the education system is like. For the first 2 years you get a liberal arts education & get to mix and match modules, before you decide your major + minor for the following 2 years. Practically it can be any major + minor based on what mods you take. For instance, an aspiring medical illustrator can take biology as a major & art as a minor.   If I could turn back time, I would definitely choose to head abroad w/o tertiary education in Singapore.  Perhaps its more suited for my personality coz I like trying everything before making a decision heh so thats definitely one shortfall of the local education system. And my situation is that I have a biz diploma but pretty much locally I'm stuck to either liberal arts degree / biz degree.. its so restricted & I would like to learn smt new instead of the same old things.  *Edit: Plus I feel like I've spent 3 years of my life here, and if I head overseas to study, thats another 3 - 4 years right there, when I could have just spent 4 years overseas for the same degree. Opportunity cost man.   I think it also depends on what you want as a future career - point of consideration - rather than just getting out of here. Cos professional careers like law for instance, if you study in the US, technically you can't be admitted to the Singapore Bar. Also, careers like being a doctor has a longer education pathway in the US, there's pre-med, an admission exam, med school, residency etc before you can finally practice as a doctor, so the overseas education advisor was telling us local students to study locally if we want to enter med school.   Best of luck!"
singapore,3dvunn,mminsy,6,Mon Jul 20 00:20:06 2015 UTC,"Couple of things. It's not exactly a liberal arts for first two years. You can remain undeclared, but that's not always a good idea. Some majors have huge course credit requirements, so you'll have to start picking up credits from your first year. It does have more leeway than the local system, but it's not absolutely free either. Liberal arts colleges have a lot more leeway than traditional US colleges and are also more likely to allow you to create your own major.   If you have your O's, some schools will require a foundation year or community colleges may accept you directly. If you're the cream of the crop, it's also possible to gain direct admission."

singapore,3dvunn,mminsy,6,Mon Jul 20 00:52:14 2015 UTC,"The only way you can get out now is your parents decided to get out of SG too, but since you are asking I don't think so.   Since you are a trans male; do you have to serve Ns? (personally I don't think so)  Anyways, your best chance would be to go for an overseas uni in america and try to secure a job there and eventually try to hit the immigrating requirements. I have several friends that did that.   Only problem, you got to start saving and investing to earn enough money, IIRC if you going to US, foreigners have to demonstrate that they can pay for their entire degree."

That is a requirement for getting a student visa. You need to expect to pay a minimum of US $30,000-40,000 to go to an American university. Canada's fairly similar for international students. And private universities will be closer to $60,000. Some American universities do give financial aid to international students, but you can't really count on that making things affordable. If you want to go to uni abroad your parents need to be on board and willing to pay. Getting a work visa and trying to get a green card after going to uni in Singapore may be a better option."

As much as you want to leave Singapore, other first-world countries only want to take in people of economic value.  Local overseas scholarships are the most prestigious and difficult to obtain. The only ones that are available are at the SAFOS and PSC level. But if you're grades are there, there's really no issue. However, local overseas scholarships also come with a bond. Meaning you'd still have to come back to serve the bond at the end of the day. If you want to leave here permanently, then I suggest you try and source your scholarship directly from the universities overseas."

singapore,3dvunn,gawdzillar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:30:28 2015 UTC,"Depends on the scholarship. There are different tiers worth different amounts. Generally the bond period is about 5 years. Bond value (how much you pay if you break bond i.e. don't serve the 5 years) is dependent on how much they are sponsoring you. For most government scholarships, they will cover tuition fees, give you a living allowance then smaller stuff like laptop, book allowance. Friend on an MOE teaching scholarship has to serve 5 year bond, bond value about 400k iirc."

Also generally to get a work visa in Canada you need to have an education and relevant work experience, not to mention the fact that you'll be competing against other people since there is a limited amount of visas. You also need to provide proof that you can support yourself with either bank slips or a letter from your employer in Canada.

It's not just the transport system that needs fixing: it's also the mindset and travel patterns of commuters.

We should really cut down on our car usage and put more weight behind public transport. More buses and more bus routes would lure more people towards public transport since its more economical. And of course, if the trains didnt break down so much and isnt so damn crowded all the time, more people would want to take public transport too.  IMO, buses can be a great alternative to the overcrowding trains. The trains are already coming in at once every 2 minutes during peak hours on the EW line. It cant get much faster than that or else there wont be enough space between trains. We could push it to 1/min but the risk of collision in case a train breaks down would be higher.  The only practical solution would be to double the number of tracks on the EW line. But that's not very feasible and it would take years to implement.   A better solution would be to have more buses that go from the heartlands straight into town/CBD. We already have the infrastructure(roads). Just need more buses. Yes, it would mean that roads would get more crowded, but that's why we need to reduce the number of COEs given out at the same time.  Or we could even consider to have bus service that mimics the train and that stops only at the MRT stations. Like a bus that starts at Joo Koon, stops only at each MRT (pioneer, Boon Lay etc.) and ends on the other side of the MRT line. This way more people can choose to take the bus instead and lighten the overloaded trains."
singapore,3dt2h4,Wheat-gen-stein,18,Sun Jul 19 14:34:01 2015 UTC,"Just a few points to point out:    buses can be a great alternative to the overcrowding trains   A NSEWL 6-car train has about 1500 passengers during peak hours. In comparison, double decker buses carry about 130, bendy buses about 130-150.   If there's one train every 2.5 minutes (24 train/hour), that means every hour, it will be equivalent to running 4.6 double-deck buses per minute, minimum. That's why bus replacement for MRT disruptions are so problematic and crowded.   There simply is no easy way out, apart from new rail lines.    We could push it to 1/min but the risk of collision in case a train breaks down would be higher.   First, trains have signalling systems to space trains out, making it near-impossible to collide with other trains. Put simply, the train operator must intentionally override train systems, just to get their train to collide into another train at up to 18km/h. It's complicated, but it is failsafe.   One of the things I've learnt talking to management people in the transport industry is that we have gone past the point where train throughput is the bottleneck. It's now station throughput that is the bottleneck on capacity: people cannot enter/leave the station fast enough to keep up with train frequencies.   Even if I somehow get a train in every minute, there's no way passengers can get out of the train in time before the next train arrives, which is why there are works on new entrances at some stations.   Again: There simply is no easy way out, apart from new rail lines.    The only practical solution would be to double the number of tracks on the EW line. But that's not very feasible and it would take years to implement.    Again: station throughput. Even if we can get people out of the station fast enough, what about their connecting modes of transport? The number of buses, taxis, and/or private cars will all need to rise as well.  I know it might be frustrating to try to find workarounds for what I've shared, but that's what transport planners have to deal with. Every single thing you change has a knock-on effect on something downstream, and may need changes upstream too."

singapore,3dt2h4,PizzaEatingPanda,11,Mon Jul 20 03:50:48 2015 UTC,Singapore public transport is still great compared to the ones in NYC and London. But those are not our benchmarks. We compare Singapore public transport to what it was 10-15 years ago vs what it is now. There were a lot fewer breakdowns and a lot less crowding on the trains and buses. The complaints are only because it has been degrading.
singapore,3dt2h4,justastatistic,6,Sun Jul 19 16:20:56 2015 UTC,"Let me offer you another perspective. Melbourne. ""World's most liveable city"". Their average waiting time for trains could be anywhere from 15-45 mins during peak hours. Off peak, up to an hour. Their trains are also poorly maintained. Rubbish, graffiti, broken bottles, urine, you name it, they've got it.  Their MYKI system(a bad copy of our ezlink) takes at least 3 seconds to register a tap. Multiply that by a long line of people during peak hour and you can more or less figure out the madness. Sometimes the machine gives no indication that it did not register a tap. Upon your exit, the ticket inspector issues you a ticket for fare evasion. It's also at least aud6.50 a day for public transport. 6.50 can net you a lot of rides in Singapore.   The whole city comes to a standstill when a strike occurs. Expect jams even if you cycle to work.  During summer, train tracks buckle often. What does that mean? It pretty much means you're screwed. Their train system is crap. Most suburbs do not have a station. You can do a park and ride at the nearest station from your place but good luck getting a spot if you are not super early. You can either Call up a friend and get him to pick you up or you can book a cab at cut-throat prices. Which brings me to my next point.  Traffic jam is the norm. Cars are so affordable that it is common for a family of 4 to own 4 cars. If I drive, it takes me at least 2 hours to get to work and I live only about 15kms from the city. That's roughly Tampines to Orchard. On weekends, good luck getting into the city. Also parking in the city range from aud4 - aud20 an hour.   They have trams you say. Well, if one tram along your line breaks down(which is fairly common), that's the end of your journey. You can either  A) call a friend. B) book a cab C) walk 45 mins to the nearest train station.  Tram drivers will also occasionally get everyone to get off the tram halfway through their journey because his shift is over.  You want benchmark? This is the benchmark from ""The World's Most Liveable City""."

Many residents are car dependent due to minimal public transport outside of the inner city – the city is one of the most car-dependent cities in the world.

As long as congestion is well controlled, there can be both healthy public and private transportation. I don't think that with more private transport ownership leads to worse transport system as how the author tries to link them. I would say we are moving past ownership to control congestion. The view now is that you can own it if you want but it will cost more to utilize it. It will be a foolish effort to fight against the idea that having a car is a status symbol because that will take decades and it might not even work. So to let the people own them and have that status symbol but yet make them drive less is the aim. To fix congestion is to increase cost for usage of private transportation, and yes it will take guts, but in a different way. He tosses out the ERP and all saying it doesn't work. It doesn't work precisely because it's too cheap, but increasing it too much will cost votes. If there's a substantial enough toll for every single meter that the vehicle travels I believe there will be less usage for sure. Decreasing number of private vehicles quota will cost votes as well because it's denying someone to own something and if there's one thing that people don't like, is that their choices are removed. He has some good suggestions, but my view is with the current status quo, the best way will be to make some options less favourable so that people choose the other option of public transport and public transport will need to improve, ie with more routes and frenqency so that people will not be fucked making that choice."

You make quite strong statements that I don't think you can back up readily like:    ... then Singaporeans would not remember the suffering of the people during the Japanese Occupation and the general horrors of war and will be more tolerant and willing to go to war with another nation.  ... on Singapore and its loss would be devastating.

""Lastly, the monument also serves as a sign of unity among the races of Singapore. The remains of unidentified victims are buried under the monument. The remains of all races are buried there and shows the unity of Singapore. It shows that the races of Singapore will remain united in times of difficulty. If the memorial were to be removed, the people of Singapore would not remember how the Japanese Occupation affected people of all races in Singapore. It is a good show of racial unity."" --> the links drawn are a little...strange (for lack of better word). Are you saying that 1) because there are ""remains of all races"", hence 2) there is unity? Doesn't work that way. Also, it is erroneous to say that ""if the memorial were to be removed"", people would not remember. Yes, monuments are (often) built in memory of - hence the term - but, who is to say that should the monuments be removed, people will forget? Pardon the blabbering, just pointing what I used to get picked on for.  While land in Singapore is valuable and scare --> scarce. For this, you could quote the land area of Singapore to further substantiate your point, if you wish to.  ""the memorial has many positive effects on Singapore and its loss would be devastating"" --> zhun bo... Jest aside, would YOU feel sad if monuments in Singapore were to be removed? Again, this is a sweeping statement. It's not as though someone did a poll and that was the ""general sentiment"" on the ground...    Hope it helps. I sound naggy, but I mean well.

If it's an evening reception held indoors such as the traditional ballroom wedding, the only acceptable answer is black tie and above depending on the circumstance.

Dressing well and for confidence is a worthwhile habit that many should cultivate. Dressing to demean others just seems pretentious, immature, and smacks of bourgeois platitudes. While I do agree that there are people who dress down because they can't be bothered, there are also many who simply cannot afford to do so up to your standards, but deem it important that they are there to celebrate the wedding. Instead of dressing with the intent to make others uncomfortable, why not just do it for yourself, and go enjoy the occassion?"

I've worn suits to an events where I was the only wearing the suit and in those situations, it can be very awkward as you always feel like you are overdressed.

In these cases, you might have indeed been overdressed. It's good to always check the dress code of an event beforehand if you don't want to stick out. Requiring a suit at social functions is largely a western practice, and depending on the country or a community in Asia, sometimes all they want is for you to not be sloppy, which can be achieved without formal attire.  In any case, as I alluded to previously, I am a believer in dressing well and for confidence. I also believe that one's dress sense is an avenue of self-expression. If you prefer to be in a suit for events, and that makes you feel good, then that's what you should wear. Don't worry about what others think. You can't please everyone, and people are going to gossip and talk behind your back no matter what you do. It says more about them than it does you."

I do think it is pretentious to presume that one's dress sense is the only way to look good, and then impose that arbitrary standard on everyone else. There is more than one way to be spiffy, and if one puts in the effort to do so for a wedding, then that is a sign that they respect both the occasion, as well as the bride and groom.  I see the social standard of suit/black tie as a guideline for those who don't know how to dress, or what to wear. For those who do, there's no reason why they can't deviate from that arbitrary standard. Unless specifically stated as requirement for an event, I do not see suits/black tie as absolutely necessary; neither is not dressing as such a sign of disrespect. That said, if the organizer wants to impose a dress code for their event, then it should be clearly stated in the invitation. I see no point in leaving it up in the air, making attendees play the guessing game. They shouldn't assume that everyone is aware of some subjective social requirement."
singapore,3dtjjb,condor_gyros,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:40 2015 UTC,"Well the significance of such a dress code is to recognise that the event has a significance above and beyond what one might encounter on a daily basis.    Another factor is that it's equally disrespectful to overdress for an event as it seems like an attempt to upstage the hosts.    And it's quite distasteful though common to state a dress code, as it indicates you don't think enough of your guests to trust that they would be able to dress appropriately. Unfortunately this is often true."

singapore,3dtjjb,Huh_ooh,-3,Sun Jul 19 09:29:07 2015 UTC,Personal experience is that how formal you dress is in relation to how close you are to the groom and bride.

But if you're not that close to the bride and groom its perdectly ok to not dress up really really nicely....

singapore,3dtc0l,redryder74,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:18:22 2015 UTC,"Got mine from bras basah for about $150. Gamin forerunner 10. Pretty basic stuff but works well enough if you just want accurate tracking of your speed (or pace), distance and time as you run. GPS does take a while (5-10mins) to lock on initially though. However if it is from the location you last used your GPS it tends to be alot faster."
singapore,3dtc0l,wsdaz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:57:05 2015 UTC,i bought the sony smartwatch 3. inbuilt gps so you can use it for running. doubles up as a smart watch during other times. price 239 from lazada. can get for cheaper if you buy it on their promotional days.

singapore,3dtc0l,akkatracker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:13:36 2015 UTC,"I got it on amazon for for US$300 or so, it was new at the time but this was a year or so ago. It is the ambit2. It works well and you can preload maps on it. I used it to ride my bike to Johor. The only thing I will say I don't like about it is the position of the GPS antenna, it is on the underside of the wrist facing towards your body and think it would acquire satellites more quickly had it been on the top. Aside form that I have no complaints."

The staff are all pretty damn friendly too.   Not sure if it's exclusive to The Pit but if you head there and are feeling faux-adventurous you can try asking for a 'Snakebite' over there. It's served in a big ass 1 L mug (think they call it a 'stein'?) and it's basically beer (forgot what it was) mixed with Brother's Wild Fruits cider. Might sound weird to some but surprisingly it tastes pleasant and gives a good buzz if that's what you're after. I like it quite a bit and it's definitely worth my money. Awesome place!

Once you post out your ns life enjoyment will depend heavy on your posting and more importantly your team. If the SCs and Regulars in your team are great then you will have a fun time. Good luck dude!

For example, Chimpanzees have very large penises while Gorilla's have tiny ones. In the former, females of the species tend to be much more liberal, while in the latter much more faithful.   As for Singapore being highest.. judging by the charts, its probably because we have one of the fewest proportion of asians for a south east country :S."

singapore,3dtb7h,pkismeyea,2,Sun Jul 19 08:42:50 2015 UTC,"We used Rentokil when we had an infestation a few years back. (same problem as you. Got it from camp and it spread like wildfire across 3 rooms)  The treatment was for 3 rounds, based on the life cycle of the bed bugs. First round to kill the adult bugs, 2nd round 1 week later to kill the young bugs that grew up, and the 3rd round 3 weeks later for the eggs that missed the first 2 rounds.   Not only do they spray the beds, they also sprayed the surrounding sides of the beds as well. After the first treatment, you could already sleep well with no bites.   We did not have any problem since then. Best $500++ spent."
singapore,3dtb7h,teamaniac,2,Sun Jul 19 09:05:44 2015 UTC,"No idea about the service quality of those companies. Doing it twice might not be enough though. Did you make sure to check every part of your bed (including the folds) and bed base? You should also get bed bug proof protection covers to cover up your bed mattress, that way, bed bugs wouldn't be able to infest your bed (the existing ones would be trapped inside). It could save you money on changing beds. Your pillows and bedsheets should also be sent for heat treatment to kill the bed bugs. If you can afford it, the best option would be to discard your bed, get a new bed, and wrap it up with the protective cover (the same for your pillows and stuff, send your pillows and blankets for heat treatment and toss them out, be responsible). At least that way, you would know that your mattress is safe, and could put more focus onto other areas. Do note that bed bugs don't only live on the beds, they could live in any parts of your room, then crawl up your bed to bite you. They could also be hiding deep within old beds which have openings. In that case, I would discard that bed.  Sometimes, treatment on a single room isn't enough. Bed bugs can move from one place to another, have you checked the other parts of your house for bed bugs? You might also want to think of places where you could have brought in the bugs from, and avoid those places (cinemas, friends' homes, vehicles etc). There is always the possibility of you bringing in new bugs even after those in your room have been exterminated. I personally know someone who brought bed bugs with her from her boyfriend's home. Bed bugs can spread through humans (clothing, bags, hats etc), but they have nothing to do with cleanliness (dirty or clean, they can thrive).  Where bed bugs is concerned, you want to do it thorough in order to avoid a recurring problem. Bed bugs multiply quickly, it doesn't matter how many times you call the pest control, as long as a few of them remain, the problem would resurge in weeks or months. Skimping might cost you more in the long term.  There are also those bed bug sprays (specifically meant for killing bed bugs), you could try to use them as supplementary control."
singapore,3dtb7h,Azuredrak,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:06:44 2015 UTC,"I got bed bug proof protectors for my pillow and bolster, so I know they didn't infest it. I threw out my mattress yesterday and replaced it with one from the guest room. The thing is I've searched all over the place for a mattress protector that encapsulates my whole bed but I couldn't find anything, some of the sales reps insisted THAT IT DIDN'T EXIST like wtf. Do you know where I can find one in Singapore?  Also I examined the whole area, there appears to be no bed bugs anywhere else. I carefully quarantined all cloth stuff and put it in a bag and  washed it at high heat. The last infestation made me spray paint my entire wooden bed white and switch to white sheets, so it would be obvious if any were on my frame, so far, I can't find anything.  As for where I'm getting it, I suspect I got it from camp (I'm NSF) but my RSM isn't taking me seriously until I find proof. I could've sworn I saw one in my camp meeting room so I'm insisting I won't go in there anymore lol. But I believe these bed bugs were from the last infestation, my floor is made of old parquet with tonnes of holes so they could be hiding inside. I'm thinking of resanding my floors and revarnishing it to close the cracks, would roughly cost me 300 bucks."
singapore,3dtb7h,Azuredrak,0,Sun Jul 19 07:29:15 2015 UTC,"The bed bug protectors for mattresses do exist, in most cases, the sales reps are just ignorant. You could get them from the King Koil showrooms. Just google it or call up the King Koil stores, I'm sure they could offer you more information. Do take note, though, that these protective covers might cost over a hundred dollars.  Your camp could be a potential source of infestation, in that case, you can only be more careful and ""suck thumb"". Most regulars wouldn't care about doing extra work, unless proven to be a really huge problem, they tend to ignore it. (my old camp's guard rest room haven't been cleaned for years when I was there, it was only cleaned when auditors finally decided to come for checks, along with the division SM)  If that is the case, try to keep your belongings in isolated lockers, change into civi clothes when booking out (take a bath!), keep the used clothes (that you slept in) in ziplock bags."

I suspect there may be bed bugs in the bus, one of my friends claims he saw one. The worst part is that bus is the only way to leave my camp if you don't drive, so changing to civi won't make a difference.   I will check out the mattress protectors today, hopefully I can get one soon."

singapore,3dqz64,KderNacht,12,Sat Jul 18 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"Aiming for a good first impression is simple: Don't over make up, don't dress too skimpy, dress however you want and be confident. Set yourself some standards on the guy's personality and social graces; do you want someone who has strong opinions over matters you are concerned with or someone who goes with the flow, does he have an unusual obsession with property, etc etc.  But if you want my personal opinion (talking as a lonely 27 yo guy in a very complicated relationship):  Because you are pretty tall, (taller than me anyway...) go with something that won't accent your height (it's a little rude for me to say, but guys tend to usually not like their mates to be taller than them, it's a guy thing). Might I suggest a sundress? If you want to create volume (you know what I mean), go with frills, they add extra silhouette and the illusion of more curvature. Don't flash skin unless you are confident enough to, because if you aren't confident, you would feel too uneasy to be yourself, which is the most important part.  But to be frank, most guys won't even notice. We are exceedingly simple creatures, and are just happy to have conversation with you. It's all about having a good time and experience.

If you're more into dresses/skirts, wear a nice dress or a nice top and a cute skirt and maybe ballet flats.    If you don't normally put on makeup/contacts, just put on eyeliner and a little bit of lip gloss/lipstick. If you don't normally wear lipstick, go for a 'your lip colour but better' or nude lip colour. Contacts are your own preference, which makes you more confident, glasses or contacts? Go for that option. I honestly think as long as you look presentable, are approachable and there's great conversation, it'll be a good date.

singapore,3dqz64,90DaysNCounting,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:47:40 2015 UTC,"IMO the key is not light conversation, but it must a topic that engages the interest of the other person. Try to ask questions about the other person and go from there. Since it's about the other person, it will naturally pique their interest (everyone likes to talk about themselves in some way or another).   I used to have a tendency to bring up heavy topics. I think heavy topics in itself are fine, but it must be something the other party is interested in as well. Thus the strategy to ask question is a more sure way of ensuring that the topic is something the other person is interested in."

What matters is that she's pleasant to be around with..maybe just some light makeup will do at most. I don't really like colorful faces..  I'm fine with casual wear, simple top, shorts, jeans, etc. Geek is attractive. At least to me because I can relate .. Just be you. Anything but beggar wear. Comfy fit looks good for me.  And on an additional note, I think dresses and over-accessorizing make one look a little bit more mature and corporate, it also diminishes your features. (Makes one older than one actually is too) - Unless of course, that's your aim and you're looking for similar type of guys.  Just be the person you wanna attract. :) Cheers."

Got the guy's number (pretty nice number too) but he has no WhatsApp so I can't dig up any dirt. Not posting names because witchhunt.  My mistake was not getting the asshole to make an offer on Carouhell first. They really need to make that more prominent instead of buried in a 9px link on the side. Doubt Carousell will do anything about it, he has tons of listings.  Between this and the obvious lowballs (below retail price for a LE item, seriously?), I'm never going to use Carousell again.

singapore,3drzmr,Asyrol,6,Sun Jul 19 05:28:27 2015 UTC,"Good Morning Singapore!  Slept poorly last night - mixture of jet lag and homesickness I think... still feeling really off.  Were the plane fly-bys last night for a special occasion (or practice for a special occasion) or is that a common occurrence?   We went down to Ann Siang Road and had dinner at one of the places there that was wonderfully lovely but more in the ""We'd like to go someplace nice for dinner"" category than in the ""We'd like to go someplace nice for dinner"" category if that makes sense.   What places can you personally recommend that's nicer than a hawker centre but not $200 for 2 people? if you could provide a rough price range that would be really appreciated as well! :)"
singapore,3drzmr,irlando,5,Sun Jul 19 01:45:58 2015 UTC,"The flybys are prep for the national day parade in August. It's an old school military power demonstration, very impressive. Singapore has one of the most advanced militaries on the planet and they like to remind their neighbours and citizens of that :)  Singapore unfortunately doesn't have many good mid-priced restaurants for some reason. You can go cheap or expensive but there's not much in between. Alcohol adds a lot to the bill. I had dinner on Friday and if I didn't have alcohol I would have literally cut my bill in half. So consider not drinking with dinner. Others can probably recommend places. Another caveat to learn about dining in Singapore is you'll see ++ after a price, that means the listed price doesn't include GST and service charge, so the cost to you will really be the price + 7% +10% in some restaurants.  Astons is a nice mid-range local chain, but it might not be fancy enough. Long story short you won't get decent two course meal in Singapore for less than $30 or $40 per person. I like Skinny Pizza btw.. Just thought of that place now, that'll be like 30 per person."
singapore,3drzmr,Asyrol,4,Sun Jul 19 02:05:09 2015 UTC,"this is perfect, thank you (and I figured the planes were for National day.. either that or we were about to need our bomb shelter ;)  I'm still a bit confused about tipping in restaurants.  Everything I read online says that you're not expected to tip in restaurants, but I guess because we're white so far everyone has seemed to make that assumption (I put down $200 for a $185 bill and he didn't ask if i wanted change, just said thank you)."
singapore,3drzmr,pratakosong,5,Sun Jul 19 05:16:57 2015 UTC,"Oh! Tipping is kinda discouraged in SG but there's a 10% service charge that restaurants will add to your final bill. Most kopi tiams and hawker centres are self-service so you don't have to tip at those food outlets.   As we don't have a tipping culture in SG, me and the wife are always bewildered by how much to tip when overseas so we usually tend to over-tip when we're visiting Europe. The service staff will look pleasantly surprised and give us a big smile so I guess the tips we give really made their day! Haha"
singapore,3drzmr,Asyrol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:34:42 2015 UTC,"hahaha that's awesome! I'm in the exact opposite boat! In North America we tip pretty much EVERY service provider from delivery people to hair stylists to servers. It's confusing here and feels rude to NOT be leaving a tip! I've heard that the 10% doesn't always go to the server, is that true?"
singapore,3drzmr,irlando,6,Sun Jul 19 05:54:33 2015 UTC,"People are not living off tips here, that's the bottom line. Give a tip if you want, it's not like Japan where they will straight up refuse to take a tip, but it's not expected.  Service can be slow here, especially when paying (I remember in bars it used to take forever for your change to come back) so they might have just taken their time. Honestly, don't let them ""force"" you to tip by dragging their feet with your change. Tell them your waiting on your change."

singapore,3drzmr,pratakosong,2,Sun Jul 19 07:00:23 2015 UTC,"Wow! I can't imagine having to tip every service provider you meet! Over in SG we sometimes do ask the taxi drivers or delivery person to ""keep the change"" :)  Yup! The 10% service charge goes to the bosses. But I do notice that some restaurants have tipping jars next to the cashier and I think the tips in that are distributed equally amongst the kitchen and service staff."
singapore,3drzmr,Asyrol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:03:01 2015 UTC,That's good to know - I've noticed a few of those so it's good to know it goes to the staff
singapore,3drzmr,Falwing,2,Sun Jul 19 07:07:41 2015 UTC,"You are totally not expected to tip as the service charge included in your bill is supposed to cover that. That being said, if you leave behind cash over the bill amount and don't specifically mention change, the staff won't mention anything either assuming it's extra tips on top of everything else.   Yeah I love the Ang Siang Hill area as well but it's not daily dinner kind of area. I highly recommend downloading the many varied food/restaurant apps such as Foursquare, hungrygowhere and Chope and then filter to mid-range prices."

And that people living in the east are much nearer to the downtown area with all the hip cool areas. Eg: East Coast Park > West Coast Park  But I don't care really. I just live up in the quiet North."

Mostly because we're a little particular about brands and wanted enough to last us to find either the same brand at a good price, or an equal alternative.  Now that I'm here, I'm not sure I would have bothered. These items seem to be a bit more expensive than back in Canada, but not so much that the shipping costs didn't cancel out the savings.  Only bonus is that we don't have to worry about a buying them for a while and can explore the best place to get them here."

singapore,3drzmr,Hahaha1276,3,Sun Jul 19 18:26:53 2015 UTC,"Morning guys! I need some advice from you all… I have been I. The army for a year + already, going to ord soon. I got straight As fory A levels but the issue is that I have not really decided on what course or which uni I should go to. Anyone who had this experience before and can help me? :("
singapore,3drzmr,Probably_daydreaming,10,Sun Jul 19 02:08:24 2015 UTC,"I gonna teach you a method of choosing a course that I used with my secondary school friends for their poly. (it can work with uni)   You will  need a pen and paper.   First write down all uni (I'm assuming you want to study in singapore) you can attend here.   Then write down all the ""school"" in each uni (I'm not sure if they have the school system e.g school of design, school of business in uni similar to poly/ite) if they don't then it will come later, for now skip.   Then write all the courses that you can attend in each uni (under their respective school if there is any), I don't care if you don't want to attend it, write down everything that you can attend.   Next, if there is no school system in uni, categorise the courses under the same school system that is used in poly/ITE. Most poly have around 7 school if I'm not wrong (or you could use the school from some poly and try to categorise the courses avaliable into the),  so 7 is a good number to start with. This step is optional of course but it will speed thing a lot  in the next few steps.   Here comes the magic, most people may not have a clue on what they want to do but they do have an idea of what they DON'T want to do. So now you got an exhaustive list of all the uni and school you can start eliminating.   First, eliminate which uni you don't want to go, you can eliminate all except one, or you can eliminate only one or none, this is up to you. I usually eliminate the polys based on distance only. (This is because I am not going to travel all the way from the west to the east for temasek poly and neither majority of my friends).   Next, eliminate each school that you don't want to do, but this time you have to eliminate to only one school and that school must be the school that you would least least likely to do. (This is why making school would be useful, it helps you cut majority of the courses out without needing to go through them). If you have multiple uni that you want to go to, each uni must have only one school.   Next write down all the course tha you have yet to cut out, and here comes the tiring part, rank each course in the school, with1 being the most appealing. If you can't do that, then you have to try to find out what each course teach as specific as possible. For example look at the poly courses, they clearly list out what you will learn, for each course, create the same list as possible, then start eliminating the ranked course from there until you left with only one.   Keep in mind,  that in order to properly use this system, you have to eliminate the one that you don't want. This system relies on the fact that most people have ideas on what they don't like to do, you know it yourself, you don't like to do certain things. There are things you absolutely don't want to do. You have to do a complete 180 degree on how you eliminate stuff.   Overall it will take you a few hours to do it, if you are really concern you will attempt and complete it. If you need anymore help you can PM me."
singapore,3drzmr,mminsy,5,Sun Jul 19 03:17:45 2015 UTC,Good advice! But don't just select a course / sch based on friends comments / assumptions. Try job shadowing / intern / even head down to the sch to see if you like the environment. Best of luck!
singapore,3drzmr,le4ge1,3,Sun Jul 19 05:22:35 2015 UTC,"agreed, open house is an option as well (but perhaps not anymore now). maybe u can googlefu abit? other than academics, u can also research about the school culture, student life, cca and so on."
singapore,3drzmr,chuck6726,2,Sun Jul 19 08:04:33 2015 UTC,"If I may, I'd like to add on too. Don't choose a course that you have little to no interest in, although it has really good prospects in the future. Some may argue that you'll develop a liking for it along the way but it depends from person to person IMO. Some may just dislike it more and more, and they won't want to work in that industry after they're done studying. Quite a waste."
singapore,3drzmr,Hahaha1276,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:56:32 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the helpful comments! I'm actually referring to University but I'll definitely list out everything and slowly eliminate.

In the first place, I guess the main problem is that I can't foresee what I'll be doing in 5-10 years time..."

singapore,3drzmr,Khael8,2,Sun Jul 19 08:48:44 2015 UTC,"I went along with my interests although my situation is not that drastic. I studied Electrical Engineering in NUS but by my 3rd year, I really didn't like it and couldn't see myself continuing it as a career. I much preferred software development, in particular, game development. I figured that I should at least finish my course just to get a degree and was fortunate enough to be able to take some Computer Science related modules while still fulfilling my degree requirements.   I guess it depends on the industry but from my experience at least, getting the ""wrong"" degree isn't that huge of a deal. I have a colleague that was an aerospace engineer who's now a technical artist and vice versa, a colleague who was an artist who's now a software engineer. After a few years of experience, the companies that I applied to didn't even look at the type of degree I had but merely focused on my work experience. And for me, it's easy to pick up skills I lacked online. But that might something unique to software development.  As for my parents, they didn't really care what I did as long as I could get a job. My mum can be pessimistic but I'm pretty sure I did my job market research better than she can."

However, most people I know that follow their passion, seem to sometimes have a grandiose idea of themselves.   Bottom line is, neither you nor you parents are right or wrong. Your parents probably can't see the career progression of your passion.   You need to sit down with them for an hour or two and go through your plan for your life and I don't mean just say maybe this, maybe that, but go through in detail. Both you and your parents will be able to find holes that will worry you and them.   Just objectively discuss with them."
singapore,3drzmr,erisestarrs,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:14:06 2015 UTC,"I went with passion (History major) because I was pretty sure I wouldn't do well in a course I only went for because it was more practical/ could potentially earn me more money (e.g. business, econs). I suppose it helped a little that I had already been burnt before trying to do a subject for ""practical reasons"" (Maths C - scored a wonderful E for it).   Perhaps you can try to convince your parents from the POV that if you did a course you had no interest in, you might have problems doing well? I feel that there is no point getting a ""practical"" degree if you'll end up with a lousy honours for it. Plus do you really want to end up working in a sector you completely don't like in the future? It's ultimately your life and as long as you're prepared to deal with the consequences of your choices, I don't see why your parents shouldn't let you choose."

I'd take a sand fly over a mosquito anytime.   That said, I don't think this brand lasts very long. Maybe it's the weather hot and I sweat it all off, but I have to reapply again after say 4 hours? (Yeah last time I used it I was walking in the hot sun for hours on end.) but during the 4 hours it's working, I find it rather effective.    oh and, this brand will bite your skin slightly. As in, after spraying it on your skin it will feel a little burning for 10 min (when you are sweaty. I guess it's the sweat and repellant interaction)"

singapore,3dq5e7,Freshcactus,11,Sun Jul 19 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"hello from my personal experience 綜合填空 questions are usually down to two options which have similar connotations   so firstly you need to read the text (before and after the blanks) to understand the context and then cancel the impossible options which are words w meanings that do not fit at all.   and you're halfway there!  then you've to consider between the remaining two (or even three at times) to see which option is the better one aka suits better.   always be careful and understand the passage/paragraphs before choosing  do not be lazy and stop reading halfway  hence you won't hold assumptions of the passage and get the wrong ideas and choose wrongly   do not waste so much time as well keep in mind the open-ended questions behind   I hope I can be of some help albeit my advice may sound obvious but really! also you may spend more effort in understanding similar words as you do your revision papers etc so you'll have a larger word bank  you still have time, all the best!!  ps/ A1 for both CL & HCL :p"

I was working at an event today and was interacting with a lot of fellow Singaporeans as the event was promoting Singapore's traditional games in conjunction with SG50. One group of Singaporeans really stood out to me as they were the textbook definition of a multi-cultural society -  a group of 6 guys consisting of 2 Chinese, 2 Malays, 1 Indian and 1 Caucasian.   They seemed like a group of best friends and I watched them as they attempted to play the traditional games, having a blast and cracking each other up. It really warmed my heart so see that they were able to get along so well despite their differences. The Chinese guys were laughing at the Malay and Indian guys for holding their chopsticks wrongly, and the Malay mocking the Chinese for their incompetence in chapteh.   It made me really proud to call Singapore home, a country that unites all regardless of race, language or religion."

Now that you've mentioned it a friend has said that her current boyfriend was meant to be a hookup but he was clingy and somehow stuck. Haha.  And why not? Hrmm. As a self-avowed third wave feminist I like to believe that I don't have any sort of moral hangups about casual sex. He was reassuring, friendly and funny, and at no point did I feel like meeting him would be unsafe. I think the point where I decided I definitely wasn't going to meet him was when a friend (whom I talked to about our ongoing okc dates) mentioned that a 'gross guy' had messaged her and I realised it was the same dude. I definitely didn't expect to be the only special sunflower he propositioned but knowing and seeing were two different things I guess, and it made me uncomfortable about the whole thing.   The other major issue was just knowing my own boundaries for personal space and past experience with not always feeling comfortable with new people to the point of feeling repulsed. Thinking too much? Probably, but I can't really help it :)"

One of them I had a great time with and she ended becoming my gf --didn't last very long though, like 3 months until I discovered stuff she had been hiding from me.  One girl I've met quite a few times now is a lovely woman, smart and very beautiful. After a few hook ups I asked her what she wanted but she doesn't want to commit to a relationship so well we're just staying fwb.  And others, that just became a hook up and again --we never talked again.  The diversity of people in there is just the same than real life I think. It made it easier for introvert people maybe, but in the end my thought is that you have people from every sort of backgrounds and every sort of motives connecting to these apps."

I live in an executive HDB flat built 20 years ago, and we have a big built-in oven below the stove. Yeah... It's a thing in condos I think.

Private housing thing  Like their cousin, the TV remote, this gets lost a lot. Multiple remote controls for when you lose one...? :P Been to other places in the region and they all have switches.

It's standard in homes in France not to have plugs in bathrooms too. It's a safety things. Your bathroom can be a wet room.  There are wall switches to turn on the hot water heater for showers. I can already tell there will be many a sleepy morning where I will forget to turn on the hot water  Just leave it on at all times unless you go out of the country for holidays or something.  There is no dishwasher, and no oven. I take it that some units do have ovens though, yes?  Most HDBs don't have oven, most condos have ovens.  There is a bomb shelter. Really? The previous tenant turned it in to a walk in closet. Do people usually repurpose these to make use of the space? Yep. Mine is also a walk in closet now.  Key Cards to get in to the unit... it's kind of like living in a hotel. What the heck do you do with your key?! Not like you can put it on a keychain  Put it in your wallet with your credit cards etc.  Multiple stand alone air conditioners.. no central AC... each with its own remote control. This condo is empty save for a million remotes for the air conditioners and blinds  Well the remotes can control any AC. Having multiple remotes is just for convenience.  The electrical outlets have switches to turn them on and off - is this a 220V standard thing that I'm just ignorant about?  It's a british thing. Singaporeans use british outlets. It's actually a neat feature I think."

singapore,3dpze0,irlando,3,Sat Jul 18 09:23:29 2015 UTC,"You can blowdry your hair in your bedroom. I do that. I noticed when I was travelling in Europe, apartments had wall plugs as well by the sink, but I don't think it's a typical design you'll see in Singapore.  Most housing units do not have an oven or dishwasher pre-installed. These are pretty much 'luxury items' to have though not a necessity for most households. People usually wash their dishes by hand; only those with the extra money to spend on a dishwasher would have them. Typically, ovens aren't really used in Asian style of cooking. We have one at home but it's hardly used except when we feel like baking. Odd though your housing locking system. Maybe it's a premium condo thing. Most ones I know are the typical lock-and-key.  I bathe in cold water... because YOLO. Nah, just used to it.  The bomb shelter at my home is repurposed as a storeroom where we keep old stuff of sentimental value.   Not too familiar with the rest of your questions so I hope someone else can answer them for you!"

singapore,3dpze0,myr0n,2,Sat Jul 18 17:10:57 2015 UTC,"Houses in Singapore have no electric sockets in the bathrooms. I'm guessing that this is a result of the space constraints and safety concerns - People blow their hair in the room (master bedroom), some do it in the kitchen. That depends on your home's configuration, but majority of the homes make use of wall switches for their heaters. Dish washers and ovens have to be separately installed, there are units with them, but not many in Singapore make use of these equipments. People usually wash their dishes in the sink. Yes, houses have bomb shelters, they are required by regulations, you cannot get rid of them. They usually end up getting used as store rooms though. Some flats/apartments have storey shelters (shared by the multiple households) located outside. Only old homes (built before 1998) can get away with not having one.  This varies from one apartment to another. HDB flats do not usually come with card keys, you can install such systems if you want. You usually only find these in the premium apartments/condominiums.  This is common. Each air-conditioning unit comes with its own controller, but they can usually be used interchangeably.  Most places have that, save for the states."

We try to be careful of our use of resources but I've never really been outside of North America before so these are a little new (outside of the bomb shelters, those are VERY new!)"

singapore,3dpze0,tehokosong,2,Sat Jul 18 17:16:34 2015 UTC,"There are no electrical plugs in the bathrooms. Where the heck is a girl to blowdry her hair?!   Never had a bathroom with an electrical plug in it. Whenever the family goes overseas and stay in a hotel, my parents always tell me in a very serious tone ""DON'T THAM THAM (wet wet) THEN USE HAIR DRYER, LATER KENNA SHOCK YOU DIE.""   There are wall switches to turn on the hot water heater for showers. I can already tell there will be many a sleepy morning where I will forget to turn on the hot water   There's a reason why i do speedruns.   There is no dishwasher, and no oven. I take it that some units do have ovens though, yes?   For my whole life, i've always used a sponge to do dishes (pleb life), never actually seen a dishwasher in my friends' house either. But i don't have many friends anyway. Also, I never had an oven in my house. Microwave only. Rarely bake or need to use an oven anyway.   There is a bomb shelter. Really? The previous tenant turned it in to a walk in closet. Do people usually repurpose these to make use of the space?   My family (most singaporeans i think) use it as a storage for things like vacuum cleaner, spare chairs, umbrellas, etc.   The electrical outlets have switches to turn them on and off - is this a 220V standard thing that I'm just ignorant about?   Hmmm didn't know there were outlets that didn't have switches."
singapore,3dpze0,eStonez,3,Sat Jul 18 11:44:51 2015 UTC,"That's too funny - I can see the logic behind not having them, they're just absolutely standard in North America!  I can see the appeal of a cold shower, but probably not when first waking which is when I will most likely discover i haven't turned it on :D  I love to bake and actually did semi-professional commissions back home, so I think that an oven will be really missed. Dishwasher I can live without - we've got plenty of apartments back home that don't have them and they're not standard there either.  Our bomb shelter was converted in to a walk-in closet, I was just taken aback at how casually she mentioned it.  How do you know to use it?! Is there a national warning alarm or somesuch?  And yes, no electrical outlets in North America have switches."
singapore,3dpze0,eStonez,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:37:21 2015 UTC,"That's too funny - I can see the logic behind not having them, they're just absolutely standard in North America!   Most bathroom and outdoor sockets in North America are GFCI outlets. They trip whenever there's an imbalance in the current, due to factors such as moisture, so as to prevent electrical shocks to the user. I've never seen anything similar in Singapore homes though. I'm guessing the only place you'll ever see them there is probably in hotels."
singapore,3dpze0,tehokosong,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:06:13 2015 UTC,"oh yes! I had completely forgotten about that ... we have them in the outlets in our kitchens as well, for the same safety reason, though you can install them throughout your home and some people do once they have small children as an extra safety precaution."
singapore,3dpze0,mingshen,2,Sat Jul 18 16:58:45 2015 UTC,"key cards are unusual; the rest are typical  other quirks: bathrooms and kitchens are usually fully waterproofed and have floor drains.   tap water is generally of a consistent temperature; no summer/winter swing. You can also drink it from the tap! No hardness/softness problems.  dishwashers are indeed uncommon (although gaining in popularity). Also uncommon: dryers.   Japanese washing machines that run on cold water alone dominate over European hot/cold machines. If you sun-dry your clothes, the antibacterial/antifungal benefit of a 60°C hot cycle is redundant. No idea what the Japanese themselves do instead.  pipes from the unit above may protrude through the ceiling; these may or may not be hidden with cosmetic panels, but they're there. Don't be alarmed by noises.  the impact of the rising and setting sun on heat within west and east sides of the unit will probably be noticeable, even if you have blackout curtains and double-glazed windows. You may have to adjust the climate control of individual rooms to compensate  some people run AC on the whole house, some people run AC on some of the rooms, some people run AC only at night, some people run AC only during the day. Philosophies differ (see also: the unpopularity of central AC). Of course some people don't run it at all. It's expensive.   Residences built since the ~1980s tend to assume ductless AC; newer designs may even have inbuilt outdoor recesses for compressors and channels for piping. That's what those alcoves are for! Even if 'split' ductless ACs now exist that only need a single compressor...  You generally don't have to wait for the water heater. Instant/tankless designs are instant; tank heater designs have enough insulation to retain heat from last night's shower."
singapore,3dpze0,ARE_U_FUCKING_SORRY,2,Sat Jul 18 13:12:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for your reply - so much good info!  I'm relieved to know that even if I forget to turn on the hot water until I'm ready to step it it won't be ice cold and not for long.  I'm understanding the practicality of the way the AC is set up here. In our condo back in Canada which was Central Air we had 2 'zones' to control that led to the overall temperature of the unit. This is definitely much more customizable and precise!  This unit has a 2-in-1 washer/dryer which was a first for me - I've read about them and how they work and they don't seem superefficient so I think we'll mostly air dry our clothes for now.  Great to know about the tap water, though I noticed we've got a slow-draining sink and as the water accumulates it looks a little brown. I've more tests to do on the other sinks to see if maybe this one (a downstairs guest washroom) just maybe hasn't been used for a while. Is it common with the humidity for rust to form fairly quickly?"
singapore,3dpze0,dtwn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:08:38 2015 UTC,"Brown is definitely unusual. Rust does form fast, but the use of rust-prone pipes or fittings would be unusual.   Is the sink ceramic slightly yellow? The humidity promotes rapid mold growth; if the sink drains slowly, that would make things even worse (soap residues etc). Under yellow lights, the colour might not be readily noticeable until the sink is wet. A spray bottle of bathroom mold/mildew remover might help there.   If the property has been repeatedly used as a guest residence, then it's possible nobody has done any plumbing maintenance. A downstairs guest washroom may also have been shoddily installed as an afterthought.   I'd run the tap for a while, then fill a glass cup or jug and look for sediment or tinted water. This would be unusual but would suggest plumbing problems."
singapore,3dpze0,ARE_U_FUCKING_SORRY,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:31:21 2015 UTC,"I noticed the same issue in the kitchen (water not running clear), but since we've started using them regularly they're all fine now so I suspect it was just disuse"
singapore,3dpze0,dtwn,2,Mon Jul 20 01:13:22 2015 UTC,"One point I've heard about dishwashers are that due to Singapore's humidity and heat, accumulating dirty dishes in the washer might stink up faster than in temperate countries, not to mention attracting possible pests like cockroaches."
singapore,3dpze0,ARE_U_FUCKING_SORRY,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:33:14 2015 UTC,Ahhhhh that makes sense. I personally have never managed to let dishes accumulate as if I'm cooking or baking a storm I put dirty stuff in as I go and when it's full I run it (usually takes bout an hour if I'm cooking).  I can see how to conserve water if you're not using a lot of dishes that you'd let them accumulate dirty for a week or longer until the unit is full.
singapore,3dpze0,hannorx,2,Sat Jul 18 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"You don't wanna blow dry your hair in the bathroom because there's no air conditioning in there. Imagine the frizzy, sweaty mess you'd be afterward. Do it in your bedroom or wherever you have a mirror. Also, not sure about Singapore, but in Thailand, the older bathrooms are ""wet"" bathrooms, with the shower head right there in the room, with no shower door or curtain. So the entire room is tile because the water goes everywhere. You definitely don't want an electrical outlet in that!"

A great place to get some quiet and air-con. There's an exhibition going on about old maps too.  Have Murtabak for lunch at Zam Zam at Arab Street Murtabak is like a pancake with chicken or mutton, eggs and onions. My personal preference as compared to their rival next door.  National Day means crowds of people in town (City Hall) to catch the fireworks display from the Padang. Do plan your transport on that night if you're at the area. Shopping A wide range of branded sneakers and sport shoes can be found in Queensway Shopping Centre. They're cheaper than the boutique stores. Far East Plaza has everything cheap too. View from Ion Sky Ion is a mall connected to the Orchard MRT Station. At 50+ storeys, you get to see the many HDBs and other buildings amongst some nature that's left.  Haw Par Villa Don't know if it's touristy but different from the usual attractions  Picnic and Kite Flying at Marina Barrage  Again, the view. And wind. Have lunch at a heartland (estate) hawker centre / market.  For an authentic feel of where most Singaporeans live :)   Hope this helps!"

The rules are just there to make sure the enjoyment of others isn't affected by people bringing food and drinks that smells and spoils the experience of others.

Shirts there were about the same $120. Note that I'm positive you can argue these prices down.  Then I started going to Raja tailor in Bangkok, sukinvent 4 or so. Three suites, six pants, six shirts and three ties for $1300usd.  Needed some altering at first but very happy with the quality.   There are cheaper that are just as good.

It's the best way to meet new people cos if it doesn't go well, chances are you'll never meet them again, and if you do click well, then you've got friends from far flung lands    If its possible, I do think everyone should go for exchange because you get to meet new people, spend time in a new culture, and get to try out different education systems, so you end up really broadening your horizons!

Going to post a thread today about a metope for next week (the 25th) as we've sort of discussed doing one but don't know if there had been anything done about it.  Now that i'm here I can organize one.  I also need to find the wet market and pharmacy closest to our temp housing (The Clift) so gotta sort through all of your response from when I asked. Stock up on essentials :)

I'd love to do mine on the 25th so that my BF can meet you all before he leaves for India and won't worry about me cavorting with people he hasn't met while he's gone :D  Our stay at The Clift is only until the end of August, until we find a place of our own, but I am always open to meeting up with anyone. No invitation refused (unless previous plans are already in place) :)"

I am part of the anime head committee club in my school(not saying which) and in reality it's like herding cats and getting them to do stuff.   We have the cosplayers who are insanely over enthusiastic and friendly over everything, some of the most socially awkward people (think watamote levels of awkwardness) and we have the most cringe worthy people who would disgust even the most normal people and the few who seems to be just constantly watching anime.   These days anime is not my entire life but part of my life, it's like another part of the list of things I do for my free time like reading books,  podcast or even cycling. (I know some people in my own CCA that are just forever watching, everyday till their studies suffer.   I've tried hosting anime movie days and various events but again it's like herding cats. I really want to believe that we are better than a bunch of social outcast but I find myself accepting the reality more and more.

Due to it being late at night (keep in mind US time at the other side of the world, this event will be overnight) I'm told that using a lecture theatre is not feasible due to not having air-conditioning."

A1: NEC costs $200+ for the smallest rooms per day thus that is out of consideration due to our event being free and non-profitable. I will try to approach NTC but there are no definite answers due to this event being a club event and NOT an institutional event.  Q2:LWN theatres and other LTs have been considered, but there are two main problems: 1) Lack of air-conditioning after 12am and 2) The fact that we are not expecting that many participants. Fitting 30+ people into LWN would result in quite an amount of unnecessary empty space, which isn't conducive for interaction between pubstompers. We want to create a more cosy environment for DotA fans to sit around, joke, chit chat and cheer teams on together. TR+s also has more screens, allowing for easier viewing no matter which way you are facing.  I hope these answer your questions. Thanks! :)"
singapore,3dl14t,emporatoex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:06:13 2015 UTC,"NTC also has a charge, but they are able to waive it off. bear in mind that they would expect to see some sort of benefit to NTC/NTU through the event. Perhaps if enough people sign up, and you contact a reporter beforehand to ensure coverage of the event. Talk to them and see how it goes.   Btw how come TR air con can be on overnight but not LT? :/"
singapore,3dl14t,MagicianMoo,0,Fri Jul 17 14:43:50 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, overnight bookings of TRs are not allowed.  Some TRs, sometimes the aircon is on all the way. But unreliable, can shut off any time. And if you did not book, security guard will sometimes come to chase you off.   Did you guys book the rooms? /u/newnar"
singapore,3dl14t,TheMCsmurf,0,Fri Jul 17 15:13:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I don't think watching in a TR will be fun. Even a small LT will provide a better atmosphere, more like a movie theater."

singapore,3dl14t,IcEyGuin,2,Fri Jul 17 13:23:24 2015 UTC,"After consulting the main organizer, yes, unfortunately you will need to. We are unable to send the merchandise out, so the only way to collect it is by doing it yourself during the Pubstomp. Sorry about any inconvenience!"

If you really are 16 or below and are insistent on coming, then we advise you to come with trusted friends, preferably an adult also if possible.   This is because the Pubstomp is held at night, you need to be able to take care of yourself, won't want kids wandering around the university at midnight, we can't guarantee their safety.  We won't be providing food and drink either, so do keep that in mind. Event is only meant as a get together for Dota 2 fans to celebrate our hobby, no strings attached."

singapore,3do401,fiscal_tiger,18,Fri Jul 17 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"Hi there, as a Singaporean who just moved back to Singapore from America, I would recommend POSB/DBS for banking, as it is by far the largest and most common bank in Singapore. Posb and Dbs are the same bank, they merged years ago, so the atms/bank branches can be used interchangebly. The basic bank account also has a very low balance requirement for the monthly fee waiver, and since you are a student, I believe that the monthly balance requirement might be waived as well. You can just step into any branch with your passport and inform them that you want to open a basic bank account, and the teller will help you. They also can provide an atm card and debit card to you on the spot."
singapore,3do401,tear_rai,4,Fri Jul 17 23:20:35 2015 UTC,Definitely agree with going with POSB/DBS!

singapore,3do401,ARE_U_FUCKING_SORRY,8,Tue Jul 21 19:13:44 2015 UTC,"Hi, welcome to singapore and to NUS! You're gonna love it here heh.   DBS Remix account and the OCBC Frank account both have no minimum account balances, account fees or card fees (so long as you go for the free card designs). If you need a debit card they will provide one (visa/Mastercard respectively) for free as well. Both provide Internet banking services so you can easily remit money back and forth from the States. Would recommend either for a painless banking experience (I have both accounts for the card privileges).   OCBC has shorter queues for atms though as mentioned."
singapore,3do401,ketsugi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:00:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips!
singapore,3do401,orestul,10,Sun Jul 19 22:52:10 2015 UTC,"Hey OP, I would recommend OCBC over DBS/POSB any day.   While it is true that there isn't as many ATMs for OCBC. I really never had much of problems looking for them, with the ATM5 networks and everything.  The queues at banks are usually not that long too!  Also, lots of their branches open 7 days a week. Someone else also pointed out that for DBS ATMs, some of them only allow cash withdraw of $50 notes. (Which is quite inconvenient, I am usually the dude who changes $10 notes with others) - None of these will happen with OCBC!   Plus you only need to pay cash at so many areas.   In Singapore, there's this network called NETS that lots of retailers have. It's basically a local version of VISA/MasterCard debit.   Your NETS card is usually the same card as your card that the bank issues you. Heck, if I'm correct, it's even an EZ-Link card. (EZ-Link card is used for public transport.)"

singapore,3do401,yipeeyup,4,Sun Jul 19 22:52:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a Canadian that moved to Singapore about 5 months ago. I would recommend OCBC. They have a lot of ATM machines, and you can use the UOB ATM machines, which adds up to more than the amount of DBS machines. Not only that, but there are never any line ups on OCBC ATMs, while on DBS ones you're going to have a couple people. They're open all week too, which is extremely convenient."

singapore,3do401,mynthe,-2,Sat Jul 18 00:55:35 2015 UTC,"Well, make sure you let OP know the benefits of banking with your current bank because I'm sure you are being helpful and not trying to critcize someone else trying to give advice as asked :)  Because I see so many of you jumping to say I was wrong but nobody bothering to actually give any advice or suggestion for another bank. How typical. I don't mind if you disagree, but I'm not here to have a dispute with some strangers about banks. I only answered what is my opinion. Feel free to have your own opinion, and definitely please do share them with OP."
singapore,3do401,damnshiok,2,Sat Jul 18 01:01:31 2015 UTC,many of their ATMs force you to withdraw $50 minimum though
singapore,3do401,mynthe,-4,Sat Jul 18 00:31:21 2015 UTC,That's not true at all. I've hardly come across that problem.

singapore,3do401,mynthe,2,Sat Jul 18 00:38:56 2015 UTC,275 ATMs out of thousands. I'm sure that's a real struggle. I rather encounter that than have to pay a service fee each time I use another bank's machine because they don't have one everywhere like POSB/DBS does.
singapore,3do401,mynthe,-1,Sat Jul 18 00:49:22 2015 UTC,"Because downvoting is how you convince other people you are right :)   If you feel so strongly against my suggestion, why not actually reply to OP and give him/her a better suggestion and back it up with your own reasoning?   For the record, I'm not downvoting you in return, in case someone else does. I just feel you've missed the whole point of this post with your narrow ""I must prove everyone else is wrong"" mindset."
singapore,3do401,keyboardsoldier,2,Sat Jul 18 01:07:08 2015 UTC,"That's not true at all.   You prob got downvoted because of this statement, which is flat out wrong. That is no longer an opinion. It is misinformation."
singapore,3do401,mynthe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:12:46 2015 UTC,"My bad for thinking he was downvoting out of spite then :)  To u/keyboardsoldier: But do you not agree that 270+ ATMs out of thousands is actually a small number? I may have encountered that ""problem"" maybe a handful of times in the years I have banked with them, and to me it's really not an issue. Not to mention that most of these $50 only machines are usually found outside their branches, along with other normal machines. They are there to help make things faster for those who wish to make $50 withdrawals. I don't think DBS went ""hey let's fuck with our customers and force them not to withdraw any money at all!"" because that would not benefit them in any way.  The convenience of having DBS/POSB ATMs readily is greater than the occasional chance of finding one that doesn't do smaller notes. At least for me.  Instead of putting in so much work to shoot down someone else's suggestion, why don't you be helpful and make your own suggestion to OP? :)"
singapore,3do401,KrazyTrain18,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:22:40 2015 UTC,Our discussion here IS the contribution to OP. He can read as deep into this thread as he wants to regarding the details of ATM availability.   Perhaps best case is to have both DBS and maybe OCBC? Availability + speed.
singapore,3do401,dl0n3w0lf,-1,Sat Jul 18 01:26:05 2015 UTC,My mom uses OCBC and it seems to work well for her. And I do agree that it's nice not to have a long queue every time you need to withdraw money.

singapore,3dksyq,KB-Jonsson,9,Fri Jul 17 06:06:36 2015 UTC,"most people seem to be working for the money more than passion. this all stems from our culture and education system. throughout our life we strive to get good grades and get a job that pays well, not necessarily something you like. what polytechnic or university course you pick is dependent on your grades and not your passion.  no pride in what you do because you see it as a job. etc etc."

First off I'll say that pros and cons for anywhere depend on what you personally like. Some people like hot weather, some like cold weather. Some like city life, some like countryside like. Some like crowds, some hate crowds.  People have listed most of the pros and cons I'd list. I definitely recommend you live abroad if you get a chance! Regardless of the pros and cons of anywhere, it will give you a different perspective.  Edit: ok, likes and dislikes:  Like:   the food, not just Singaporean but international. Many big cities don't have much variety of food. the weather the women are good looking tbh, and show a lot more skin than women in colder countries :) as a foreigner it's easier to make friends (foreign and local) than in a lot of other countries from a work point of view there are lots of industries and jobs here   Dislike:   It's crowded everywhere. In my personal opinion even Tokyo isn't as crowded as Singapore. The trains are more crowded in Tokyo but the streets and shops etc are not as crowded somehow. It's a small city. You're never more than two or three connections from knowing anyone else in Singapore, which makes it feel like living in a village at times. Compared with bigger cities like London, Tokyo and I feel even HK, there's not as much variety of places to hang out. Singapore doesn't really have interesting neighbourhoods, almost everything interesting (not counting nature reserves) is all within walking distance in central Singapore. This again leads to the village feeling because it feels like everyone I know is always going to the same events, the same restaurants etc. People are so desperate to find something new to do here that anything new or cool is always over subscribed until it falls out of fashion"

Most of the points have been covered, but overall, I think Singapore is an amazing place with many positives - and the biggest negative is that most Singaporeans I know (including my own relatives) are ungrateful for what they have. Way too many folks I meet are whiny and kiasu. I'm also shocked with how backward the average Singaporean is with respect to progressive social beliefs (LGBT rights, racism, etc). I would rate Singapore as low as middle-America when it came to something like this, when it should ideally be comparable to large cities like SF, NYC, London or Tokyo."
singapore,3dksyq,crispy_lemon,6,Fri Jul 17 14:13:28 2015 UTC,"I didn't live in Singapore extensively but I go there quite often. What I like most about Singapore is the public transportation. It's links the city pretty well and most food and shopping centres are located near MRT stations. It's also safe and clean. I'm also impressed by your history and how Singapore got to the place it is now. However, it's a bit pricey and is very small, so you can run out of things to do fairly quickly.

It's very safe, clean and the infrastructure works. It's everything you need. But.. It's insanely expensive. After a few weeks, you run out of things to do that won't set you back $100 at least. Housing is insane...  Other people complain about the weather, and I do so too at times, but the fact is that it's fairly reliant. You know how to dress all the time, when to bring umbrella etc.. It's consistent which is nice, and you get somewhat used to the heat after some time.  Biggest dislike: people don't pay any attention, they walk super slowly and look into their phones at crowded places, bumping into people and slowing the pace down. Pretty much everyone does this, and you'll lose your frickin mind if you're in a hurry and have to walk behind an army of smartphone zombies.."

singapore,3dksyq,myepicdemise,3,Fri Jul 17 15:25:27 2015 UTC,"As a Singaporean, my theory is that our culture makes us not receptive to change. The government has been very old-fashioned all along, nothing much has changed in some of our policies like conscription. The traditional gender role instilled in our mindset means that there will be a lot of uproar if the government decides to be progressive and make the females serve the military. They will lose a lot of votes and that's what they are afraid of."
singapore,3dksyq,MagosBiologis,2,Sat Jul 18 01:47:40 2015 UTC,"Eh I definitely support female conscription. Sure, I wouldn't want females to do front-line brawn-based roles like commandos or NDU, but there's nothing inherently male about being a clerk/manning a medical centre/driving a vehicle/logistics/even firing a modern rifle."
singapore,3dksyq,myepicdemise,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:33:45 2015 UTC,"Then the uproar won't come from you basically. There are many hoops to jump through in order for the change to happen: AWARE, females who are themselves old enough to vote, parents of young daughters who don't want their daughters to suffer any ""hardship"" in the future. I certainly don't see it happening because the current government won't even touch this subject with a ten foot pole."
singapore,3dksyq,guoshe,0,Sat Jul 18 16:47:04 2015 UTC,"uh please do your research before slinging mud. AWARE certainly recognizes that male-only conscription is problematic for many reasons. their current stance is for a reform of conscription and NS. to quote them:   Some women find the military fulfilling and have what it takes to make good soldiers (as many female SAF regulars demonstrate).  At the same time, many would not be a good fit – and the same is just as true of men. Instead of pegging people to rigid roles based on narrow views of gender, we suggest giving everyone an opportunity to do something for society, in ways that better utilise their potential and serve a wider range of important needs.   funnily enough there'll be resistance to reform from some guys themselves. I had a discussion with a NS course mate before about whether conscription should be reformed and he basically ended up saying that females should be protected by males and therefore shouldn't serve the army..."
singapore,3dksyq,Arnator,-5,Tue Jul 21 07:25:16 2015 UTC,"Many people seem to question this conscription service of our country. But serving NS is not just about giving our two years and what's fair.   If all females serve as well, then war happens. who will be left running the country ? The economy still needs to move during war. Though at a major setback.   Also, think of the logistical nightmare if all ladies start serving.  All being said, who knows when will they start get drafted ... Our birthrate is indeed very low and unsustainable."
singapore,3dksyq,komnenos,6,Fri Jul 17 17:33:42 2015 UTC,Eh Israel is always on the brink of war and has all sorts of trouble with the Palestinians and Islamic extremists yet the women are conscripted just like the men (and they have a robust economy as well).  Only a handful are actually in combat roles and there don't seem to be any problems with running the country. Edit: And why would it be a logistical nightmare having women?  Anyways wouldn't the older members of society end up running things just like they always have while the younger generation goes to fight?  And do you actually see Singapore being plunged into a massive war anytime in the near future where the entire population has to be mobilized?  If you're so worried about this why not just make the military volunteer like most of the world?
singapore,3dksyq,myepicdemise,3,Fri Jul 17 18:15:43 2015 UTC,And do you actually see Singapore being plunged into a massive war anytime in the near future where the entire population has to be mobilized?

You think MRT breakdown is bad? Haha. Almost everywhere else has a way worse public transport system. Train breaks down in London (common occurrence on some lines) while you're just sitting in another train for half an hour clueless because they somehow failed to announce it.  Food is cheap and good. So much good food everywhere, I can't stress that enough. Where I'm at right now, everything's so expensive, like minimum 8 USD unless you want McD. Teh peng is the best shit and I miss it. No snow. I hate snow. It's nice for a day and then the aftermath is shit. At the same time, SG's weather is also a dislike since it's always fucking hot and humid. Many friends and all my family is in SG.  Safe. There are some places in the US where you just don't feel safe walking in broad daylight, much less at night. The few reports of armed robbery is also very ""exciting""; at least I'm not in Baltimore.  I know a lot of people complain about the nonexistent politics in SG, but I'd rather take a functional one-party state than the clusterfuck of US politics. Wanna see what real gerrymandering looks like?   Dislikes:   Singapore is crossing the line between densely packed and overcrowded. I don't like living in bumfuck nowhere, but at the same time I don't like being squished against the MRT doors. Cycling in East Coast Park is like an obstacle course. Cars and houses are stupidly expensive. Food and public transport is cheap but living as an adult isn't only about food and public transport. Amazon Prime is pretty amazing. Just forget about the fail sale 2 days ago. You can't avoid the putang ina bobo while playing on Dota 2 SEA servers. At least I can queue on USW to avoid (most) of the jajaja.

I miss the fantastic public transport and not having to wait 30mins for a train on a Sunday.  I do not miss Singapore's muggy weather. 16C - 21C is like having permanent air conditioning. You can go for months without sweating even once. I do not miss the obsession with phones, like seriously stop touching your damn phones. I do not miss the exorbitantly priced cars ($24k will get you a decent car over here), the government, Singlish, nor the ridiculous queues.  But damn I miss Singapore's Mc Spicy.

And everywhere is so so crowded, going to work, coming home, shopping malls, any time, anywhere. I go to the nearby park for a jog and there's 20 other fellows jogging with me. It doesn't help when the weather is humid as well. I feel so...suffocated. And I know, all these can't be helped.   Finally, what I really don't like is the nurses' pay here.

What I like about Singapore:  1.) Definitely the clean and efficient transportation, Singaporeans complain about it breaking down and such, but they don't realize how much better our transportation is compared to other countries. Heck, Boston and NYC trains are shitty af IMO.   2.) Hawker center food- cheap and affordable. But restaurant food in SG is almost as expensive as the US with smaller portions.  3.) Bubble Tea- I am obsessed with bubble tea and Singapore doesn't charge me 6USD for a cup, so I like that.  4.) Safe environment- my mom asked me to go down to the market area opposite my place in Singapore to 'walk around' at 12am since I was so bored at home.  5.) Easy to travel to neighboring countries.  Dislikes:  1.) Weather- Can't deal with humidity at all. I am back in SG for now and I still can't adapt. My face breaks out with oil at 2AM?! I feel like I am back in puberty. Still haven't found a remedy for my face yet.   2.) The rigid systems/customer service. YES means YES, NO means NO. I always end up in a rage when I talk to any CS agents in Singapore.  3.) The hive mentality  4.) Crowds  5.) Education system- I had the pleasure of going through k-12 in both SG and US due to moving back and forth so the comparison game was strong."

Environment is pretty clean too (not because there are lots of cleaners, people just respect public spaces and not litter)   You need to be proficient in Japanese in order to really live there long term.  Japanese culture can be weird at times.   If you can't take cold weather, it would suck for 3 months in a year.  Earthquakes.

singapore,3dksyq,another-work-acct,3,Sat Jul 18 01:43:07 2015 UTC,"I've lived in India and Singapore.  Stuff I didn't like about India (specifically Kerala):   Singapore is much cleaner, India has litter everywhere.  Roads here are a million times better. Indian roads get hit hard during the monsoon and often have dangerous potholes that get filled with water so you can't see them. Singapore is much safer. Nobody really follows road laws in India and the roads are awful there. I had to walk on this highway for a few minutes to get to the supermarket because there wasn't a sidewalk. Pretty scary when you have massive trucks driving past you at 70km/h at night. Singapore has way less crime. The food in Singapore is better IMO. Kerala has a lot of Indian restaurants but most of them are just cheap hawker centres and I think the good Indian restaurants in Singapore were as good if not better. Singapore also has more options while India pretty much only has Indian food. Public transport sucks in Kerala. My state doesn't even have a metro (although they are building one at the moment). Buses are super disorganized - I honestly wouldn't be able to get anywhere without the help of a local. Buses can also take a long time to arrive sometimes.  Indian bus trips are much bumpier - fun, but not exactly convenient. Also pretty crowded and they still use a conductor/ticket system which is pretty shit. Absolutely fucking awful internet. My wifi in Kerala would go down every month and the customer service was fucking terrible, I could barely hear what they were saying and they would keep telling me to restart my router and do all sorts of pointless things before sending a technician. Sometimes the technicians wouldn't even come which was dumb. Broadband is pretty slow but acceptable, but it's extremely unreliable. I had to use those USB dongles for a year - those were a nightmare, constant disconnects and awful speed. Indian roads are bigger. Probably because the trucks and buses are HUGE over there, single-decker buses are almost double the size of a single-decker here. The roads also twist around weirdly and aren't as organized. Strikes are common in Kerala. Sometimes people conduct ""hartals"" where they basically throw stones and stuff at any vehicles on the roads except stuff like ambulances, effectively grinding the state to a halt since nobody can go anywhere. Pretty stupid but it gave me a few extra holidays a year. Laws aren't enforced as tightly over there. I've seen kids get cigarettes easily from stores that don't bother asking for your ID. IT stuff is much harder to find. Sure, supermarkets sell phones and stuff but good luck finding decent computer parts without having to shop online.  (depends on your state I suppose). Airport sucks compared to Singapore's. It's not bad but it's pretty bland and boring, nothing special about it. Overall, you feel pretty helpless there sometimes. In singapore you have all these boards that tell you where the MRT is, electronic signs that tell you how much longer you have to wait for the next bus, a great subway system that goes pretty much everywhere - Kerala doesn't really have any of that. I couldn't find any convenient bus directories to tell me which buses went where, there isn't even a metro, no electronic signs, none of that stuff. It's easy to feel lost there and it made me realize how much you take for granted in Singapore. Sometimes internet technicians don't even bother coming after you call them - stuff like that is really irritating. In singapore you've got tons of online resources to help you get around, bus routes, mrt maps etc, while in Kerala you barely have any of those and the internet is so slow you often feel like you're ""off the grid"" sometimes.    Definitely prefer Singapore."

You're given a terribly secure neighbourhood, prices are stable for the most part and most household items don't cost your left leg. The connectivity by public transport is seamless and restaurants, shops and such are open til late and open even on the weekends. The whole place is goddamn clean to boot.  As Singapore has a multi-racial society, it is not likely that we are genuinely xenophobic. I don't feel threatened as a foreigner, but I have experienced examples of biased treatment in my time here.

Safety - not much crime to worry about here, can feel safe wandering around wherever, whenever. Weather - nice to have summer all the time and consistent length days Nasi Padang and Nasi Lemak are surely foods of the gods. More money to be made here and lower tax rates. Traveling is easy & cheap here - so many nearby places to visit. Exercise - really nice active lifestyle here. Park connectors and workout areas are great!   Dislike:   Crowds - Singapore is VERY populated. Also its just chaos most the time, no one really looks out for each other or even thinks about an efficient way to walk around. Escalators - make up your mind Singapore! Every shopping centre/MRT/etc has a different direction! Either the left side goes up or the right. Pick one and make everything consistent! This only adds to the crowd chaos above. Weather - while I do like it, god damn is it hot sometimes. Bus number 40... Sadly I have to catch this bus frequently and it is surely the most inconsistent bus in Singapore. Comes every 20 minutes... Sometimes... Also I think this must be the bus that wannabe rally drivers drive. That or its the trainee bus driver route. Terrible driving. Food - I miss actual fresh milk and free range eggs and meat that I don't have to question. Beaches - I wish Singapore had nice beaches to swim at! Alcohol prices. $15++ - just add the tax/service charge to the menu items!"

Basically, like most Singaporeans, I used to quite jaded over the years with the gahmen/media/relatives/etc telling me over and over how good we have it in Singapore, and we should be grateful to the gahmen/PAP/LKY for what we've got. I was sceptical and thought it was just regular nationalistic propaganda.   After moving overseas, turns out they were right.  I miss the public transport, governmental efficiency, efficient public healthcare, low taxes and most of all the cheap and tasty food in Singapore. There are so many little things in Singapore that it's hard to appreciate until you're living overseas and you don't have them at hand. As for how the government treats low-income citizens... sure, elderly tissue-paper sellers and McD workers have it tough, but at least they're not freezing in the streets while it's snowing in winter. Other than in Switzerland, I've seen large numbers of homeless people in every major European city I've visited. I have no idea why they can't house them here despite the the high taxes (income tax 20-45%, VAT which is basically GST 20%).  That's not to say that UK is bad. I don't regret living here at all. The universities are top-notch, the natural scenery is a lot better and I find the weather far more comfortable. If it's cold in the UK you throw on an extra layer or scarf or something and it's good. If it's 33C and steaming from recent rain and you need to move about outside in SG there's nothing you can do but sweat and suffer."

And of cos relatively compared to other countries, there's less places to visit as a 'local tourist / tourist in your own home'.

As for learning, I learnt the game mostly from word of mouth (from classmates) and advice from some 'friendly strangers' in the shops (not sure from hougang or bugis). Played it for a while until the classroom fad faded out (for stuff like yugioh and tao pok etc).

But my experience with Magic is this: the standard format gets very expensive over time. You wind up buying cards that are tournament legal for slightly less than 2 years when the new rotation system hits. This is why the modern format is such a hit over here. If money isn't an issue, then that's OK but modern is less of a money hog since the cards will always be tournament legal, barring any bannings."

singapore,3dlvt6,cragkonk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:28:21 2015 UTC,"Not really a veteran (playing for 3 years) but some advice has really helped me, such as looking at some of the basic rules interactions in terms of ""flavour"" for you to understand them easier.   For example, some people may find understanding the difference between Regenerate and Undying a little difficult to grasp (""can i sacrifice and then regenerate to save my guy""). The way it was explained to me was ""regenerate = captain america's shield, undying = Jesus"". Undying creatures hit the graveyard then come back, regenerate creatures never die but get the damage shielded from them.   Learning the difference between activated and triggered abilities (e.g. ""whenever you sacrifice a creature"" vs ""sacrifice this creature: do something"") was something I neglected in my early days.   Besides that, learning about stuff like tempo advantage and resource exchange (wasting two burn spells to nuke one guy isnt the best) is definitely helpful. Go ahead and come up with wacky combo decks, but you have to evaluate whether the ends are worth the means. (That being said, I am a diehard Johnny. Heartless Summoning for days.)  Above all, have fun and meet new people when you play.

Granted it's different when you compare to a car, but the general gist of it is the same. Not only is this illegal (you're printing the illustrations and the Magic the Gathering logo without consent from Wizards of the Coast), you're also essentially 'pirating' the game.  Which would automatically disqualify you from the tournaments. If everyone does that, there would be no incentive and profit for Magic the Gathering to continue coming out with new ideas for cards, killing the entire franchise.  TL;DR  Yes it can be done, but it is also illegal and printing shops would also not agree to print it since it's very obviously against the law.

Any attempt to breach the subject would be met with either condescending ""get over it"" remarks, as if one has a flu one day and gets well after a day in bed, or the ""if you say that again, i will slap you"" from parents, or even the alarmist action of calling the police. This is why i found difficulty seeking help, the stigma of owning up to mental disorder.   This would teach him to not joke around.   Depression isn't a joke, neither does it come to one as an enlightened idea. You speak as if its a plan a 5 year old formuated to get a parent's attention.   maybe he'll snap out of it   Maybe my grandparents can snap out of cancer and tuberculosis too.

Society invests 10+ years of education, shelter and proctection in you, and it'll be a cold day in hell before it lets you off without returns.  I know someone who's relative had a failed attempted suicide attempt. It's subjective. You'll get trialed for it and if the lawyer can prove that you were not mentally sound prior to the attempt, all good, you go into IMH, counselling, help etc. If not, you spend some time in jail or pay a fine. If you even have a lawyer.   Maybe it is true that Singapore really owns my body, i am not allowed to leave my misery, even when it is a voluntary act, and any attempt caught by the government will send me into a place where they decide my fate.

I just don't agree with the term 'arrest' being always applicable here. If they can charge you for wanting to commit suicide, that seems a bit preemptive."

You'll get trialed for it and if the lawyer can prove that you were not mentally sound prior to the attempt, all good, you go into IMH, counselling, help etc. If not, you spend some time in jail or pay a fine. If you even have a lawyer.   Totally ridiculous if you ask me."

Usually for attempt suicide it's quite ""simple"" case. After accuse been arrested, he will be interview by IO to take statement. Then he will be assess by in house doctor for physical and mental assessment but mostly physical part before referral to IMH. At IMH, he will be assess by psychiatrist and the doctor will determine how severe his suicidal behaviour. If it's not so severe, he would've walk out of lock up before 48 hours probably with a bail.  Don't be harsh on yourself, if your friend been admitted that means he's in big mess.

Or, primary schools that have affiliation to secondary schools.   IMO, the primary school you go to has a very small impact on your educational pathway in the long run. In local university, its not uncommon to find students with average PSLE scores of 200-220. Its also not uncommon to find students with high PSLE scores of 250-260 not getting into local university at all."

singapore,3dos4q,mayotoast,7,Sun Jul 19 11:40:24 2015 UTC,"i think the statistics will tell a very different picture. a high PSLE score correlates to a good secondary school and that is when the stratification really begins.  a ""branded"" primary school for your daughter also means that her network of friends are more affluent and generally have better family environments.  we all love the story of the underdog or the smart kid that waste his life away to become a dud, but i'm sure the odds are greatly in your favor when putting your child in a good school compared to a trashy one.  don't kid yourself that all our schools are equal. of course with adequate parental support your daughter can beat the odds and excel in any school, but why give her a handicap on purpose?"
singapore,3dos4q,sct_trooper,8,Sat Jul 18 09:59:19 2015 UTC,"I would love to see the statistics! If only MOE would commission a study. All they would have to do is to give us the data on local uni students' PSLE grades and primary school.  Although, one must understand WHAT makes a good primary school. A branded school may be seen as good and have lots of rich kids in it. However, it may be due to the fact that rich kids have tuition and stable homes. So even if you put a poor kid from a broken family into a 'branded' primary school, he might still not be successful in the long run.  The study could be simple, just compare rich kids in branded schools vs rich kids in neighbourhood schools. And poor kids in branded schools vs poor kids in neighbourhood schools. From there, you can tell if its the school that makes a difference or if it is the money that makes the difference. My bet is on money.  Maybe I have an unfair perspective. The uni friends I met were mostly from neighbourhood secondary schools. While the ones from my JC class that did not make in into local uni happened to have really good PSLE scores too(only 4 out of 20 made it to local uni lol). At least they were better than mine. And just in my family, my sister went to RGPS while I went to a neighbourhood primary school. I made it to local uni but she didnt."
singapore,3dos4q,Wheat-gen-stein,3,Sat Jul 18 12:11:06 2015 UTC,"of course its the money. but the thing is branded schools are so overly subscribed, wealth effectively becomes a criteria for entering the schools.  Firstly, the neighborhood around the school is comparatively wealthy. raffles girls primary is in bukit timah. tao nan pri is surrounded by apartment/flats with sea-view (a seaview flat cos around your hdb flat price + 1 room). if you are rich enough, you can even relocate your address to game the system.  secondly, you need parents to chip in hours to do volunteer work for schools. Double income families cant do that, parents with shitty jobs that cant take time off cant do that either."
singapore,3dos4q,sct_trooper,2,Sat Jul 18 13:39:26 2015 UTC,"So at the end of the day, what school a kid goes to (crappy or good), it has little to no effect on the child's educational performance. It boils down to how affluent your family is. So why worry about sending a child to a branded or neighbourhood school?"
singapore,3dos4q,Wheat-gen-stein,2,Sat Jul 18 17:31:55 2015 UTC,But! It is a required field to fill in when applying for public sector jobs.  No idea whether they look at it or not.
singapore,3dos4q,Razorwindsg,6,Sat Jul 18 07:28:20 2015 UTC,"""Branded"" usually just means that the school has a longer history, or that the school has produced above-average examination results.  Branded I would say: Nanyang Primary School, Raffles Girls Primary School, Tao Nan School, Henry Park Primary School, etc.  Do note that trying to get in these schools is often much harder, and it will only be easier if you are yourself an alumnus or if you live nearby, perhaps.  There are ways to enter ""branded"" schools in Primary 4, but it all depends on how ""gifted"" your child is."

singapore,3dift5,another-work-acct,4,Thu Jul 16 16:19:54 2015 UTC,"I read the first article posted. Will get through the entire report soon.  As someone mentioned, it is reasonably balanced article. One thing that irks me, but is reportedly true was this:   Singapore has very little crime and virtually no official corruption.    I like how he used the word official.  One thing my experience taught me is that crime rates posted by authorities are observed due to crimes being reported to the police, and not by crimes actually being committed. As a criminologist, we are always made to believe that the crimes rates reported is usually underestimated than the true crime that is happening on the streets. The same thing happens for corruption and white collar crime. Like any country in the world, there will always be crime, and if people think that crime does not happen, that's just a myopic perspective. As a famous (and successful) advertising campaign says: ""No crime doesn't mean low crime.""  Towards the end of the article, I do agree with the author on his two challenges that Singapore has to meet. With the introduction of social media in recent times, Singaporeans have another avenue to bitch and moan about the way things are run. So much so that the government is not equipped (or well versed) on how to deal with the social ramifications, and it scares them. So unless Singapore goes by way of being China (i.e. blocking social media), the government needs to be able to speak with its citizens in a pragmatic sense, as well as being more upfront about processes. Gone are the days of mindless drones, our generation is evolving."

singapore,3dln38,dashrandom,7,Fri Jul 17 08:55:01 2015 UTC,I thought it was 16.
singapore,3dln38,KeythKatz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:15:24 2015 UTC,Think it you can consent at 16 but it's statutory rape if the guy is same age or older or something due to some law. It's only not statutory rape if the girl is 18.
singapore,3dln38,dashrandom,2,Fri Jul 17 09:25:06 2015 UTC,"Sex with a person below 16 is called “Statutory Penetration of a Minor Under 16″, S376A, Penal Code. If the minor is a girl below 14, the offence is called statutory rape.  If the girl is 16 and above..... ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"

singapore,3dln38,myepicdemise,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:18:30 2015 UTC,Not true. Remember the female teacher from RI who did it with an underage student? She got jailed for 9 months if I remember correctly.
singapore,3dln38,GulagAdventures,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:36:18 2015 UTC,"Was it classified as rape though? Note that the penal code specifically states that rape occurs when a man penetrates a woman.  How much jail time would a man have got if the genders were switched?  Edit: I checked the relevant statue.  From our AGC  375.—(1)  Any man who penetrates the vagina of a woman with his penis —  so yes, women cannot commit rape.  As for the RI case, I did a quick google, but could not find much. This article refers to the case, but nowhere in the article was the word ""rape"" mentioned. Instead, the term ""had sex with"" is used instead.  Another similar case says that a female teacher was charged with ""having sex with a minor"". Again, no rape, no statutory rape."
singapore,3dln38,myepicdemise,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:01:53 2015 UTC,"Yes I should have clarified it isn't rape. The punishment seems to be around the same as any case of underage sex despite the male being younger than 14, just because a women can't rape a child. Exchange the gender and you have statutory rape. it'd be around 15 years' jail instead of the common 9 months."

singapore,3di66m,tonyp7,5,Thu Jul 16 15:37:25 2015 UTC,Business card. We don't really care which coy you are from. More of you being a legit insurance agent.
singapore,3di66m,tonyp7,6,Thu Jul 16 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"What do you think about the savings plans? It seems like there are so many hidden fees (monthly, yearly, on switching funds etc) that even if your underlying funds are making +6% or so you're probably just getting like 3."
singapore,3di66m,kyith,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:44 2015 UTC,"Well 3 main things come to mind:  First. If you are talking about non-investment linked savings policies, it should be rather straightforward. Even though those fees you mentioned are still present, it is all simplified and the 2 main figures you should be concerned about is One. The premium you have to pay (together with the frequency for XX number of years), and Two. The projected returns. Those fees you mentioned are already factored in.  Second. If you are talking about Investment-linked savings policies, it is structured a bit differently. Take note: by law, your insurance agent has to explain to you all of these fees or they can be financially penalized under the new balanced scorecard regulations. Generally speaking, the fees for such plans are as follows:   Bid/Offer spread (when you want to withdraw funds/ surrender your policy). The Bid/ offer spread at my company is 5% Policy fee (for managing the account). The fees at my company is $5 per month, if your policy has insurance coverage. If there is no insurance coverage, this fee may be waived. Professional fees and/or fund switching fees. These may be waived at some companies. At my company,  fundswitching used to be free, but now there might be a $20 fee for the third switch each policy year Fund Management Charge and Custodian Fees. These fees, expressed as % p.a., will be deducted on a pro-rated basis at each asset valuation before determining the Bid and Offer Prices. In any case, the mentioned charges and fees shall not exceed the maximum charges specified. Lastly there is insurance charges if you choose to include insurance/ critical illness/ accident cover. The charges vary based on age, coverage and policy   Third. The most important point is that most savings policy from insurance companies include insurance cover, and should be the major point of consideration as opposed to investing that money on unit trusts or on the stock market.  Hope I answered your question (Sorry, I know the formatting is terrible and I'm not sure how to correct it)"
singapore,3di66m,tonyp7,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:20:09 2015 UTC,"I'm talking investment linked policies. I'll give you some very simple examples:   I had equities in an Henderson China fund. When I saw it skyrocket about 2 months ago I switched my money on this fund to another one: I lost about $100  in the process which I did not really expect. Funds management fees. I understand in principle (eg 1%pa) except they NEVER tell you WHEN this money is deducted from your fund and how much it was, making it completely opaque. same thing for Financial advisors: why can't we know when their fee is deducted from the plan value and how much it was? This is made IMHO very opaque on purpose. You just get a global valuation and all the fees are purposely hidden."
singapore,3di66m,kyith,2,Thu Jul 16 14:39:33 2015 UTC,Henderson by itself have the most crazy expense ratios ever. but the problem is that ILPs are a black box of fees and if a ILP does not provide enough value you should just purchase the unit trust on its own.
singapore,3di66m,tsukuruu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:44:53 2015 UTC,yes. Luckily for me I was client a standard life and since they're shutting down their Singapore operations ill get my money back in full with a bonus.

singapore,3di66m,AsksIfYouAreATree,2,Fri Jul 17 04:16:16 2015 UTC,"I guess the additional value, and the main reason why you should buy such insurance products in the first place, is the insurance coverage. if you are not interested in that, then there is no reason to buy an ILP"
singapore,3di66m,irlando,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:47:48 2015 UTC,"i think i am not saying the funds are bad, in that, they have their flaws, but not everyone can be an active stock investor, and likely most lose money in stocks, because they are unwilling to put in the adequate level of work to reach a competency that they can build wealth wisely.  but this ILP..... i struggle to see how it make sense."
singapore,3di66m,irlando,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:22:30 2015 UTC,"Well, Fund management fees should be disclosed. But even if it does not, You should be able to find it on the company's website. Even though I could not find information on Henderson China Fund from AIA, GE or Pru, I could find information on various China Funds:  http://www.prudential.com.sg/export/sites/default/prudential_en_sg/resources/downloads/factsheets/PGCF_May15.pdf  https://www.greateasternlife.com/content/dam/great-eastern/sg/homepage/personal-insurance/find-the-right-plan/build-my-wealth/wealth-accumulation/smart-invest/fund-managers/fund-facts/greatlink-china-growth.pdf  http://www.aia.com.sg/en/individuals/funds-information/investment-linked-plans/snapshot-of-our-funds/aia-greater-china-balanced-fund.html  Such information should be available online. (BTW all three funds have a 1.5% management fee per annum.)  I'm not sure why there was a $100 loss in the process. You would have to ask your agent about this, and he should tell you.  As for our fees/commission, I guess some people are not comfortable talking about how much they will make from you. I generally honestly reply my clients if they ask me. Usually, All these fees (including the commission of the agent) would be reflected in the sales illustration as the total amount of deductions.  Hope this is useful"

singapore,3di66m,malaysianlah,2,Thu Jul 16 14:25:49 2015 UTC,"I can honestly say I do not get 50 clients a month, and my company is still happy enough to keep me around. To my knowledge, the local insurance companies (AIA, Aviva, GE, NTUC and Pru) do not have such requirements, but rather a low total sum per year. (As mentioned above, my company requires annual sales of $8K for me to continue to work there.)  This 50 clients per month target she has may be the result of a high-pressure agency that she joined, or part of an incentive program."
singapore,3di66m,malaysianlah,2,Thu Jul 16 14:41:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll discuss it with her, she was applying to one of the big local companies you named (I won't say which one) and they apparently told her this in the interview. Maybe she misunderstood or maybe like you said they were trying to pressure her."
singapore,3di66m,KeythKatz,2,Fri Jul 17 01:38:36 2015 UTC,If she gets 50 clients a month.  She can see a 6 figure salary in the first 2 years and 7 figures by the 4th year. Life ain't that easy.
singapore,3di66m,KeythKatz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:49:30 2015 UTC,Haha. Maybe that is why my salary range is in the low 5 figures. I guess I value my free time more than money
singapore,3di66m,KeythKatz,2,Fri Jul 17 06:35:54 2015 UTC,"Even top agents or manager do not maintain 50 new clients a month, doesn't matter if they are shield or non-par plan. You would burn out before long. Plus you only really need 200 good clients to make a career, looking after them  will last a lifetime."
singapore,3di66m,nassux,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:38:35 2015 UTC,I agree
singapore,3di66m,NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT,4,Fri Jul 17 08:49:08 2015 UTC,"I think this may be a silly/naive question, but is there a difference between the offerings from the various insurance companies? There are so many, I don't know which to choose from.   Also, for someone looking to purchase their first insurance policy - not considering those that my parents have already gotten - what would you recommend? I did a quick search and it seems as though personal / medical is recommended. Any thoughts?  Thanks for your time! I do have friends in this industry and I don't avoid them, but I just wonder how much they do/do not tell us."
singapore,3di66m,jswk,9,Thu Jul 16 15:38:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. All the companies do offer products that have slight differences. For example for hospitalization policies, you can ask any insurance agents what their company offer that the other companies do not and they will be more than happy to tell you.  For first-time buyers of insurance, I always strongly strongly strongly recommend a hospitalization policy. You are paying for it out of your Medisave and it would cost less than $300 per annum, so if you have started working, you would have more than enough in your Medisave in less than a few months. If you can afford it, you can add a cash rider covering the deductible and co-insurance. if you can't at the moment, skip it.  Second policy you should get is one to cover critical illness (some company calls them dread diseases or major illnesses). Even as young as 20, I have friends suffering from leukemia, colon cancer, etc... 1 in 2 Singaporeans get Cancer, and 1 in 3 get heart disease.  It is often said that it is easy to die in Singapore, but it is not cheap to fall sick. a good rule of thumb is usually get coverage of 5x your annual income (as as that is the average time you will be unable to work). NOTE: I know that may be too expensive for you to afford at this point. not to worry, you can start small and buy a small policy now, and slowly buy additional policies when you are financially able to.  Life Insurance: Only buy it IF you have dependents. If you are unmarried and your parents are financially stable, this is not that necessary at this point of time. if you have people that are financially dependent on you, your life coverage should be the amount they need multiplied by how long you need to support them. E.g. if you have a 5 year old son, you need to support him for 18 more years, and you think an average of $1,500 a month is enough for him, your coverage should be $1500 x 12 months x 18 years = $324,000. (Once again, if this is too expensive, you can start small and buy a small policy now, and slowly buy additional policies when you are financially able to.)  If you have a non desk-bound job (like teaching, sales, manual labor etc...), a long term disability policy (some companies call it income protection policy) might be good. This pays out a monthly amount when you are physically unable to perform your job (like a teacher losing her sight or permanently losing her voice). such policies are usually inexpensive.  Lastly, if you are making good money, have low liabilities and have all the basic insurance you need, you can consider savings products or start planning for retirement."
singapore,3di66m,mwolfee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:07:52 2015 UTC,"If my company provides hospitalization insurance, should I still get a hospitalization policy?  Also, where are the statistics that show 1 in 2 singaporeans get cancer? That figure seems exaggerated."
singapore,3di66m,tonyp7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:40:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. Simply because you will not stay with your company forever. One day you will quit/change jobs or retire eventually. If you become uninsurable in this period, you might not get cover once you leave your job. Since you can't touch your medisave anyway, might as well use it to get hospital cover. Depending on the hospitalization cover your company provides, You can choose not to get the cash rider to cover your deductible and co-insurance, and rely on your company policy to cover those.  I can't seem to find the stats that 1 in 2 people get cancer, but the Singapore Cancer Society mentions that 1 in 3 Singaporeans dies of cancer. The Singapore Heart Foundation shows that nearly 1 out of 3 deaths in Singapore, is due to heart disease or stroke."
singapore,3di66m,tonyp7,4,Fri Jul 17 17:22:25 2015 UTC,what insurance are you on personally?
singapore,3di66m,greenteaapple,2,Thu Jul 16 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"Because I am in this line, and I see very often what can happen if I am underinsured, I have more insurance than most of my peers, even though I still feel that it is not enough.   I have an Integrated Shield Hospitalization plan with the accompanying cash rider to cover up to private hospital I have an investment-linked policy, bought for me by my parents, but now serviced by me. This give coverage of around $100k for death and disability, and $150k for critical illness. I purchased for myself a traditional life policy once I started working. (no this does not count towards my sales targets) I pay for 15 years, and I get covered $105K for death, disability and critical illness for life. I purchased a personal accident policy that covers me for death and disability, and provides medical reimbursement for non-hospitalization medical expenses that i incur as a result of an accident. I bought a savings policy to force myself to save every month. I purchased a long term disability policy  I have the DPS, deducted from my CPF  I like to backpack alot, so I purchased an annual Travel Insurance"
singapore,3di66m,greenteaapple,4,Thu Jul 16 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"Are you a hot lady wearing very low cut dresses showing  your cleavage? Because I almost bought some insurance from a chick that was seducing me , then I realised the commission she is making from me is more than what I had to pay in geylang to get some action, and here I was not getting any...  So.. my question is.. how ""easy"" are insurance agents?"
singapore,3di66m,ARE_U_FUCKING_SORRY,3,Fri Jul 17 06:19:53 2015 UTC,"Lol! Nope I am a guy here. TBH I have seen other agents using their attractiveness to close sales, but I have never heard of any of them actually offering extra services. So I guess not so easy after all."
singapore,3di66m,CyberDonkey,2,Fri Jul 17 06:30:41 2015 UTC,Hahahhaa okay okay. Do you think its easier being a guy or a girl in the industry?
singapore,3di66m,CyberDonkey,3,Fri Jul 17 06:33:07 2015 UTC,"Wah! Difficult question to answer. I think being a guy or girl makes no difference, but people enjoy doing business with more attractive people, so it would help if you are good-looking. Maybe that is why my sales is only average"
singapore,3di66m,aintcoming,3,Fri Jul 17 06:39:44 2015 UTC,Why don't the per-year car insurance discounts (forgot the name) carry over to the next car?
singapore,3di66m,irlando,2,Thu Jul 16 14:09:07 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about no-claims discount (NCD)? By right it should carry over and increase until it reaches 50%. If you have car insurance, and you don't make any claims this year, you should enjoy 10% NCD the next year, 20% the following year, and so on, until you reach the cap of 50%.   Of course, this discount goes away the moment you make a claim. Some people buy an additional rider, something called an NCD protector, that enables you to maintain your discount when you reach 50%, and allows you to make up to a claim a year. This protector varies from company to company though.  Edit: sorry, I misread your question. I read is as why does it not carry over to the next year. Give me some time and I'll check why."
singapore,3di66m,deweye,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, it's the NCD. It doesn't seem intuitive for it to not be carried over if using the same company, and especially if it's the same class of car."

singapore,3di66m,amiaspoon,3,Thu Jul 16 15:46:24 2015 UTC,What percentage of your sales are from friends/family vs cold calls and approaching random people?
singapore,3di66m,minsunye,4,Thu Jul 16 15:22:56 2015 UTC,"TBH, I am really bad at approaching total strangers. Tried roadshows once or twice and realized it is not for me. Most of my clients are referrals. When I provide good enough advice/service to people, they refer me to their friends or relatives."
singapore,3di66m,GunkyEnigma,3,Thu Jul 16 15:39:03 2015 UTC,This is how all insurance should be sold. It makes me angry that people think interrupting strangers is somehow okay.
singapore,3di66m,kyith,2,Fri Jul 17 04:34:27 2015 UTC,"Sometime some people needs to start somewhere I guess. I think I am generally quite a social person, that is why I have such a large circle of friends to work with. Not everyone might be in the same situation as me"
singapore,3di66m,epimeliad,3,Fri Jul 17 06:37:50 2015 UTC,"Ok time for the ""rude"" question.  How much money do you make?  Extra points for breaking down into:  -How much basic  -How much comes from commission  -How one sale affects your commission"
singapore,3di66m,squeeish,2,Fri Jul 17 04:32:25 2015 UTC,"Ok. Last year I made an average of close to 3K a month. I don't have any basic (even though there are programs for new agents to receive basic at my company, I decided not to go ahead with it because I wanted the flexibility of taking time off). 100% comes from commission. It is possible for one sale to make a big difference in my income if it is a million dollar policy, but the average hospitalization policy would probably give me a commission of less than $100. Life policy would be higher, maybe around 15% to 20% of the premiums paid."
singapore,3di66m,yourm2,2,Fri Jul 17 06:20:44 2015 UTC,How long do you work every week?
singapore,3di66m,mohaf2000,2,Fri Jul 17 10:31:03 2015 UTC,"It really varies. I can sometime put in a 20 hour in a week, I can sometime work 60 hour in a week. It depends on my clients and when they are able to meet up, or if they need me to do some urgent servicing."
singapore,3di66m,starlightandbright,2,Fri Jul 17 17:33:13 2015 UTC,"At some point I needed to view a specialist for some issues. I was not hospitalized so it wasn't covered by my company's (shitty) policy. This thing cost me roughly $2k of my own pocket. After that, I tried to search for an insurance that would cover outpatient specialist but could not find anything. Why is that?"
singapore,3di66m,luggagepls,2,Thu Jul 16 14:08:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, most insurance are structured this way to prevent abuses of the system. In the past, some people liked to see specialists, even for the most mundane problems like the flu and various pains, and tried to claim it under insurance. So to prevent abuses of the system, insurance is structured to require a past hospitalization stay as the distinguishing factor to verify if the a visit to the specialist can be covered by insurance. This also helps to keep the costs on health insurance low"
singapore,3di66m,luggagepls,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:36:16 2015 UTC,"That's a huge gap in the market. You can actually get full international coverage from big names like Axa but it's over $3000 a year. I'd be quite happy to have full coverage for say, 1000 a year, but only valid in Singapore."
singapore,3di66m,coffeeteaormeh,2,Fri Jul 17 04:20:41 2015 UTC,What do you think of MAS' CompareFirst portal? Do you see the DPIs with their lower premiums as competition/threat?
singapore,3di66m,coffeeteaormeh,3,Thu Jul 16 16:21:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly no. I have some really smart friends as clients; engineers, accountants, doctors, teachers, etc... Often I will explain to them various products; how they function, various important details to note, then 2-3 months later, they will come back and ask the same questions. They always would find it easier to find someone they trust, and let him/her deal with everything, simply because it takes too much effort to try to understand and absorb everything themselves.  Service is another reason why people prefer working with agents instead of buying insurance online. Let's use travel insurance for example. If you buy travel insurance online, or even at the ATM, you will find it is generally cheaper than buying from an agent. But when you try to make a claim, that's where the problem starts. I have friends that have bought travel insurance online, but when they lost their luggage, and tried to make a claim, they called the company's hotline, and was left on hold, transferred from person to person, etc... until they gave up. The travel insurance I sell might be 10% more expensive, but I can help them settle all the administrative nightmare.  Lastly, we (or at least me, and the people I work with) are financial advisors, not insurance salespeople. This means we provide advice that would not be found on the website: advise like how much coverage, how to stretch your budget, when might be a better time for purchase because of promos/discounts, etc...  To be honest, unless you are very familiar with finance, you might not be able to use the portal very effectively. Cheapest may not necessarily be best. While everyone can easily compare price, they may not understand the features as well, and I think the vast majority would prefer to work with a person over this portal. just my 2 cents"

I'll be buying a new phone outright, while the BF has an iPhone to stick a SIM in to.

I personally use Singtel, but I don't see how I've enjoyed anything more compared to the other telco companies... perhaps just compare on price point?

singapore,3dk0hr,Asyrol,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:20:48 2015 UTC,The plans I'm looking at all seem pretty comparable on price. We will need internet once we've got a 'real' home. Are there advantages or discounts for bundling services? Maybe I should choose based on my preferred internet provider
singapore,3dk0hr,dtwn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:49:42 2015 UTC,"If you have multiple plans with a telco, they do offer a discount. Singtel for example, offers a 15% for two lines. I'm not certain about the others, but I would assume they have a similar plan as well."

singapore,3dk0hr,dtwn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if you're familiar With Rogers, any of the ISPs here are probably cheaper and better.   My Republic and ViewQwest have been gaining popularity for their comparatively low prices till the major ISPs dropped their prices. I haven't used either, but My Republic has been getting massive complaints about their support or therelackof."
singapore,3dk0hr,Asyrol,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:18:06 2015 UTC,Yeah we were with Roger's in TO. What's your opinion of M1?
singapore,3dk0hr,dtwn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:25:18 2015 UTC,"M1 is the smallest of the big three providers, and has poorer coverage in some areas compared to the other two. I have never used it, but while M1 has run into some service issues, all three do so to some extent. Generally minor, though in recent years there have been several days of mobile networks going down entirely or slowing considerably."

singapore,3dk0hr,dtwn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:36:04 2015 UTC,"A lot cheaper and faster for the most part as I understand it, same screw you attitude though.   My Republic and ViewQwest are definitely rocking the boat to some degree. Fibre prices went down dramatically after their entry into the market."
singapore,3dk0hr,mwolfee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:45:21 2015 UTC,"Singtel and Starhub will have discounts on your subscription if you subscribe to more services (mobile, internet, cable TV). Personally the discount is not attractive enough for me to switch from my current ISP because of the included VPN that lets me watch some geo-blocked content.  Off the top of my head ViewQwest and MyRepublic both have it as a basic service in their internet plans. M1 has a super cheap gigabit connection though, at 39.90/month."
singapore,3dk0hr,Asyrol,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:19:25 2015 UTC,"yeah I'm really leaning towards ViewQuest or MyRepublic for internet, and mobile service elsewhere.  We don't need a land line or TV.

Afterwards we're going to go wander and explore a bit :D  I've got a phone, but it's locked to my old carrier so I'm not sure I can do the prepaid card thing :/"
singapore,3dk0hr,mwolfee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:05:02 2015 UTC,"Ah damn. Great thing here is that phones cannot be locked to a telco, so you can buy a nice one and not worry about being unable to use it overseas.

In my area we somehow have a flock of wild green parakeet-looking birds that love to race each other around the blocks while calling out to each other. Sounds just like a car race with the Doppler effect except instead of engine noises its cries of EEk! EEk! Eeek! eeek!  Starhub is pretty ok, but yes generally not much difference between the 3 main mobile providers.  As for Internet access, I personally use MyRepublic and have had no issues with them. I especially like their routing system that allows for access to Hulu and Netflix, and thus avoids the need for a separate VPN.

Use his kernel (Rev 4.4) for maximum performance and battery life.  I've tried several other ROMs (both stock and AOSP). Each has some flaws. Only Civato's ROM is the most stable so far.  RE: Multi DPI - The ROM already comes with Xposed Framework. Use the following App Settings Lollipop apk if you want per-app DPI support: http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/mod-app-settings-v1-9-2014-05-14-t2437377/post61696098

Agree with u/dashrandom that Aftershock is fantastic for pre-made gaming computers in Singapore. Much better value than other gaming brands (e.g. alienware.) Also, most other brands that are not dedicated to gaming will not churn out gaming pcs at a good price (e.g. Dell, HP)  I got an Aftershock gaming laptop so that I can bring to my in-laws place if necessary."

I think it will be quite hard for me to build my own.   But Great to know that fuwell is still highly regarded now. I frequented there so much pre-poly days !
singapore,3diulx,Fatalityv,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:30:35 2015 UTC,"Haha I see. Don't worry. Now you've got two options.   Plan out your budget, see how much you are willing to spend on each component and go to websites like Anandtech or TechPowerUp to read up on reviews. Before committing to a purchase.   Purchasing a part from Amazon or NewEgg will sometimes be cheaper but you have to take into account that the product may not have international warrant coverage.   Tell Fuwell or whatever shop your budget and what you're using it for. Buy."
singapore,3diulx,MateenLOL,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:52:25 2015 UTC,"Op, to narrow down the price list, hwz hardware clinic forum has many laojiaos there That can put together a good list based on your budget and requirements. From there then you can research further. Just post a thread. Assembly wise I believe PC themes and tradepac both do assembly, although a forumer known as Nigel has a shop at l2 of slq which is reccomended by many forumers. Assembly is one of the services that he provides."

singapore,3diulx,ButWhy214,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:00:46 2015 UTC,What do you mean if I know what I'm doing? My friend also recommends me to buy at tradepac.
singapore,3diulx,ButWhy214,4,Fri Jul 17 13:58:33 2015 UTC,The benefits of building one yourself far outweighs the convenience of getting a pre-built one. If you compare price by price for each component in a pre-built desktop you'll realize how much more you can do with that same amount of money by building one yourself. Stores like Fuwell all have a price list so you know how much you're gonna be paying. You can ask for build recommendations on HWZ forum based on your budget. The shop will assemble the entire desktop for you so you just need to transport it home and you're done.
singapore,3diulx,ButWhy214,3,Thu Jul 16 23:19:13 2015 UTC,"Tell you what la OP, maybe i can help you out. Let me know what is your budget and what you want to use your pc for. I've been building PC's for 6 years now. I can give you a component list which you can then take to a shop of your preference at sim lim and ask them to build it for you. Never get pre-mades. They're always rip-offs."
singapore,3diulx,S1erra7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:05:52 2015 UTC,"Wow? Help from an internet stranger ! Hoozah!  But seriously I'm at a lost. I dunno what's the ballpark figure for a decent gaming PC that will last me ~3years. Right now the only game I'm playing frequently is Heroes of the Storm, but i'n running it at a rather low setting on my Nvidia GT630... Can't play all the new games like witcher 3, GTA etc.  Budget wise I wouldn't want it to be above $2000 including monitor, speakers and all the other peripherals. Would that be possible ? Will I sacrifice a lot  ?  I saw the Aftershock desktop at $1800. Abit pricey but yea. Been hearing good stuff about their brands. I know buying individual parts for myself is much cheaper but it is really much troublesome. Warranty problems and what nots.   TLDR; out of PC building for so long, I need some solid advice. Afraid of stepping back in thus, looking at buying pre-mades to save the hassle."

singapore,3diulx,S1erra7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:19:11 2015 UTC,"bro, thanks so much for your help. don't mind i ask a few stupid questions...   processor still using i5 ? not i7 ?? is 1 stick of 16 GB ram better than 2 sticks of 8 GB? Radeon > GeForce?  i've always heard geforce cards generally better any reason why need 2 hard drives?   Thanks a million"
singapore,3diulx,ButWhy214,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"If you are just gaming and all round general purpose usage, todays i5 is your sweet spot. Unless you are doing stuff related to rendering or video editing, you don't really need and i7.  Yes 2 RAM sticks are always better as if one fails during POST, you always have another ram stick to troubleshoot with.  Radeon is not necessarily > then Geforce, but the 390 i picked out for you has a slight edge over the 970 and these two cards are the kings of 1080p resolution gaming. In the end it's your choice to choose whichever.  The biggest performance you always see on your pc is when you put your OS on an SSD rather than a HDD. You can get boot speeds of 8-10secs from the time you power on till you load everything at main screen. You can also put your most used games and programs like steam, chrome etc and get really fast loading times for them. Use your HDD for mass storage for less frequented things like games less played or what not."

singapore,3diulx,ButWhy214,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:19:39 2015 UTC,"okay everything seems fine. If you're not overclocking, you don't need an aftermarket cpu cooler. The stock one would do just fine. Other then that i would like to ask if you are purchasing your parts from local stores?  EDIT: If you are tight on budget, you can opt to get normal ram instead of your corsair vengeance ones. You could save up to 20 SGD for 1% performance loss."
singapore,3diulx,S1erra7,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:43:36 2015 UTC,"I will. I've been comparing price lists for stores in Sim Lim so the parts will come from there, though maybe not all from the same store.  Are there any big differences between the RAM manufacturers? Otherwise I'll get the cheapest 2x4GB I find. Edit: Could you recommend a wireless adapter too?"
singapore,3diulx,DingyWarehouse,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:37:26 2015 UTC,"Nope there isnt. If you're on a budget you can get the cheapest 2x4GB u find first and go back later for something like the hyper x fury or corsair vengeance.  If you have a router that provides AC standard connection, then you should go for this: Asus PCE-AC56.  Otherwise go for this: Asus PCE-N53. <---- I'm currently using this one."

If you are looking for more human interaction and knowledge exchange, you should always start with the field experts in Singapore, maybe they have a meetup group. http://www.meetup.com/  If you really want to learn just to know more, and still prefer a traditional degree, going overseas would be preferred (because the local ones are now just mainly focused on getting their students into jobs)"

Though I haven't started school, I can tell you some good things I have heard:  1) Unisim part-time courses are heavily subsidized for people above the age of 40!  for the younger ones, we pay around 530 per module, but you all pay probably 200-300 per module!   2) You can take up to 8 years to finish your degree. As you can't predict what happens in the upcoming years, they give you the option of selecting fewer modules to complete a semester.   3) it's at night, so you don't have to take time off work.  4) Many 'older' people there, so you don't have to feel out of place with younger undergrads. I was worried about my age but a student was telling me that her classmate was 50 years old.  5) the course modules got standard. ""better than poly courses"" is one of the feedback given by a friend. And my upcoming course is making me use a textbook from NUS.  I believe the open house is happening next month, so you can dro by to ask. The next semester begins in Jan 2016."

When you reach the latter, don't blindly opt further studies unless it's directly relevant for your career (or done for personal enrichment).

singapore,3dhto0,TRex_Eggs,0,Fri Jul 17 09:20:52 2015 UTC,"The text for those people not on FB:  Bad News!! To those of us who are patrons of the Shashlik Restaurant, located at 6th Floor Far East Shopping Centre, take note, they will be closing their doors permanently at the end of this year, when their lease expires. Went there with the missus and eldest son yesterday night, and was treated to a good meal of Borsch, Oysters Mornay, Escargots, Shashlik on a skewer and closed with dessert consisting of a shared baked Alaska and Banana Flambe. Typical fare for anyone who have been going to Shashlik for easily the last 25 years.   On leaving the restaurant, I asked the lady waitress, where are the other Ah Kors? There was only one around last night. Apparently, the one on duty was the last of the Mohicans, all the rest have slowly but surely passed on. They have decided that since no one was keen to buy over the business, they will all retire when the lease ends, come end 2015.  So sad. To the un-initiated, Shashlik was born about 30 years ago, when Troika, a Russian-themed restaurant, closed operations in Shenton Way area, and the staff who were working there split up to from Shashlik Restaurant and Balalaika Room in York Hotel. A detailed write-up can be seen here. (http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2014-01-29_182119.html )   For those of us who just about came into financial independence in the early 90's, this place was a great place to eat. With good food, easy parking and also proximity to other post-dinner places, like the Lido theatre opposite. In fact for me, this was the where I brought my wife, Christine, when we went on our first date. The Shashlik dinner we had was memorable, but not so the Jim Carrey movie that I brought her to watch after that. Thank God, she didnt dump me after that terrible movie (Ace Ventura something), so I reckon, the food at Shashlik must have helped spruce up my image some. We also had our Medical School Freshman Orientation Committee (FOC) celebratory dinner back in 1989, after the completion of a successful orienation program. Bottomline, it was a place which was serve good food, at decent prices, with the right atmosphere and a great location. Being half Hainanese from my mum's side, I am proud of my Hainanese heritage seen here in this restaurant. Hainanese men were known for working with the Colonial and European bosses, learning the restaurant trade as they went along. Many like the late captain and waiters of Shashlik, venturing out on their own to ply their tradecraft. They were also known to be very adapt at adjusting the tastes of Western dishes to suit the local palate. Another reason, why the food at Shashlik has always tasted better than your average angmoh jiak restaurant.  So, this time round, it's real. Shashlik is indeed closing its doors for good. If you havent been there in a while, and like their food, better go soon. For me, will have to bring my family there again some time, and take some pictures of this place. Just for memories sake."

singapore,3dha45,mailamaila_wamai,36,Thu Jul 16 07:03:11 2015 UTC,"Every election season, prior to the election, a council (Electoral Boundaries Review Committee, or EBRC) is convened to draw up the election boundaries. This is where people say the shady stuff happens - gerrymandering is the practice of drawing up election boundaries based on past voting data and polling data, to favor the incumbent party. Here's the election boundaries for 2011. It has resulted in some pretty strange demarcations. You can see the evolution of past boundaries here. Note also that this is not a practice unique to Singapore; most modern democracies practice some form of gerrymandering. Make of that what you will.   On to the factual stuff. Last election, there were 87 seats for elected MPs; this number changes season-to-season. The seats are distributed according to the discretion of the EBRC and the President. The labels are self-explanatory: SMCs are contested with 1 seat, GRCs have a number of seats. Since we still use the FPTP system, it's a winner-takes-all thing - whichever party gains a majority in the GRC takes all the seats. edit: The party that has a majority number of seats forms the government.  The existence of GRCs is ostensibly to ensure minority representation; the President (I believe) specifies how many and what race of each minority each GRC must have at minimum. Generally speaking, though, because GRCs require heavy manpower investment and the winner-takes-all system, GRCs tend to be less contested by opposition parties.  By the same token, the most hotly-contested areas tend to be SMCs. Historically, Potong Pasir SMC under Chiam See Tong's SPP and Hougang SMC under Low Thia Kiang's WP were the bastions of the opposition parties. Last election, Potong Pasir was lost by Chiam's wife. Low's WP also successfully contested Aljunied GRC, which is the first time that an opposition party has won a GRC like, ever.  On top of the 80-some elected MPs, a number of seats are provided to Nominated MPs (NMP) and Non-constituency MPs (NCMP). There are currently 9 NMP seats. NMPs are members not affiliated with any political parties, and are there to provide neutral, unbiased viewpoints. All NMPs have some form of expertise outside of politics, and are elected to (again, ostensibly) provide differing viewpoints.   There are currently 3 NCMP seats. NCMPs are opposition MPs specifically nominated because of their performance in the previous election season; i.e. the results were close enough or they garnered a large enough proportion of votes that a seat was offered to them.  NMPs and NCMPs by and large have the same rights as normal MPs, except that they are not allowed to vote on bills relating to 1) amendments to the Constitution 2) usage of public funds 3) vote-of-no-confidence in the Government 4) removal of the President.  That more or less ought to cover question 1.  Uh... Moving on.    After the boundaries are drawn up, on the advice of the Cabinet, the President will draw up a writ of election. A Nomination Day is chosen. Before that day, any aspiring candidates must put down a deposit calculated based on 8% of an MP's allowance the previous calendar year, rounded to $500. Last election this was $16k (gives you a good idea of how much they earn :P). Any member who runs and fails to earn at least 1/8th of the votes in the constituency will forfeit this deposit and the money goes into the government fund. So.... you can see why, despite independents being allowed to run, contests are usually only held between the PAP and the bigger opposition parties.  On Nomination Day, the parties put forth their candidates' details. For GRCs, the minority member must also declare their minority status. At the end of this day, any constituency with only one candidate or group of candidates will be considered a walkover, and that candidate/group of candidates is considered officially elected.  After that, every constituency which is being contested will be considered up for polling. Between this day and 2 days before election day (and only then), the parties are allowed to campaign. The day before election day is marked as a cooling-off day, and no party is allowed to campaign on this day.  If your constituency is up for polling, you will receive a polling card before election day. The card tells you who the candidates are, where the polling will be held, etc. Polling day is considered a public holiday, and it's mandatory to vote. At the end of the voting window (usually 8pm on that day), all boxes are sealed, untouched. Candidates and their agents are usually there to observe this, and may seal using their seals as well if they desire.  Once this is done, the boxes are transported to counting centers under supervision. At the centers, the votes are counted in the presence of candidates and participated in by their agents. Here's the manual for counting agents to observe. Once counting is done, a recount may usually be held if the difference between the top number and the subsequent candidate is a really narrow margin (2% iirc). Otherwise, as long as there are no accusations of fraud, the votes are considered final and the winners are declared. More information from the electoral department is available here.  That's 2, 3 and 4, right? Onward to the most contentious question! But before that, here's some info on by-elections.  By-elections in Singapore are usually only held if an entire constituency is vacated. Last season, the most prolific case was in 2013 in the Punggol SMC. The PAP candidate, Michael Palmer, was implicated in an extra-marital affair and volunteered to step down. The process is largely the same as the GE, and the seat was eventually won by the WP by a narrow margin.    Right, so. Before we go into the more contentious political stories, here's a more lighthearted one. The result of the polling for each constituency is usually announced to the nation via live television by the Returning Officer. Last election, RO Yam Ah Mee briefly achieved memetic status because of his nasal, monotonous voice (he later said this was because of some procedure that had been performed on his throat), and because of the repetitiveness of the lines (pursuant to Section something). This was a very much 'you had to be there' thing though, since viewing the videos now, none of them seem to be very funny.  Okay, so, major political events.   The largest and longest-standing bones people have are usually related to one of the following:   HDB upgrades. This is PAP's biggest carrot-and-stick. Close contests in their favor are usually awarded with upgrades, and upgrade promises are usually very much part of campaign promises. For very old areas, this can be as simple as lifts that can access floors other than 1, 5 and 9 (like, wtf is with that anyway); newer areas like Bishan-Toa Payoh usually receive spruce-ups. Parks, pools, facilities, road revamps, new slip roads to ease traffic, stuff like that. On the other side of the same coin, constituencies that vote for opposition parties tend to not receive upgrades at all. One of the biggest stories last season* was Potong Pasir ending its 28-year glut and finally receiving housing upgrades after SPP lost the seat to PAP. Stick? Carrot? Hm, you decide. ERP, COE, and other middle-class problems. The Budget has always by-and-large been about the working-class, housewives and the elderly. This has led to a lot of unhappiness among the middle class, who feel like they're being neglected - houses too good to receive HDB bonuses/rebates, maid levies going up, soaring COE prices, the ever-shrinking size and ever-soaring price of property. More recently, though, house prices and COE prices have cooled a lot (just in time, although if you consider that COE prices are simply regulated by regulating their supply...).  Employment. This is a much larger issue for people competing for middle-management and specialty jobs. A lot of anger about importing foreigners - causing crowds, competing for housing, higher education, jobs, things like that.  Transport. There was a promise by the PTC last year that with the new formula, prices of transport would rise and fall according to market forces. When the price of crude oil went up because of the spat with OPEC, public transport prices rose; when the price of crude oil dropped after it was resolved, the prices... went up? And trains are breaking down more and more often.   Whoops. Turns out, this is not a government problem; yes, the LTA has some level of oversight, but because of the privatization of transport, it's not actually the government's fault. There's some negotiations going on right now about bringing some of the responsibility and risks back to the Government and involving them a lot more in management. If you think about it though, SMRT is really just pushing the risk back to the government while they keep the profits, so I'm not sure what this discussion is really about or why it's even happening. I'm sure I'm either missing something, or SMRT is just being a massive asshole."
singapore,3dha45,denunciator,19,Thu Jul 16 09:12:49 2015 UTC,"I ran out of characters. 10k limit boys.  Anyway.  If you want to be more involved in Singapore politics, just read the papers or watch the news and think about every article from different viewpoints. First, from a government candidate; then, from an opposition candidate; then from a regular old Joe, and see what you glean from it. You might've already expected local news sources to be biased, but it might surprise you to find out just how biased they can be. Read the reports on events like the Aljunied debacle, the Michael Palmer scandal, coverage of house pricing measures and COE prices and transport. Turns out, even rising public transport costs can be spun positively if you do it right.  And before you think I'm an anti-government shill - no. I'm not really interested in politics outside of a purely academic slant; my MP does a good job and I'm happy with what he does. I used to be much more proactive in arguing politics but that's always a huge no-no socially.  When campaign time comes, read the campaign and rally speeches. Think about the promises the candidates make - are they practical? Are they relevant? Is there a bigger issue not being addressed? What is the intent of promising the things they do? Based on that, you can form a really clear picture of the philosophy behind each parties' candidates.   Spoiler alert: the way they campaign to the rich is very different than they way they campaign to the working class. Really."

It's also been helpful to me to realise that bias isn't always conscious/ agenda-driven, so just knowing ""oh I'm reading ST"" or ""oh I'm reading TOC"" isn't enough. For eg, it could be that reporting under time constraints leads to news being put out with important questions unanswered. It's useful as a reader and voter to be asking those qns - what a piece of news means to x/y/z, whether justifications given for any particular stance are reasonable or fair, etc."

singapore,3dha45,mwolfee,4,Thu Jul 16 08:44:59 2015 UTC,"The different parties will have to submit the names of candidates to the Elections Office(?) on Nomination Day. The winning party of that constituency will go on to represent them as a Member of Parliament. Major events will be Nomination Day, and the rallies held by various parties across the island. Then there's Polling Day where people go vote. There are people from the parties with interest in the constituency present when the votes are being counted, to ensure no foul play. Parties can also request a re-count of needed. You will get a slip of paper with your personal details. Bring it to the designated polling station in your area. Once there, the process is pretty straight-forward. There will be several steps. First one will be after queuing, you'll give that paper along with your NRIC to the person sitting at a desk, who then will check against the list of voters and another party will verify. They will then give you the voting slip, proceed to the polling booth and tick your choice, and then fold it and drop it into the ballot box A lot of things may or may not have impact on the elections. Hot button issues have been things like accountability (re: AHPTEC, Admirality CCC), things like COE and home prices, affordability of goods, MRT breakdown, etc etc etc.   My memory is hazy about the polling day itself (as well as nomination), but that's how I mostly think it goes."

It is very much possible that you might reconsider your future during the two years in JC. Furthermore, there is a high turnover rate for lawyers in Singapore who quit after working for 5 years. Many quit citing reasons like lack of work-life balance and lack of passion for the job. Thus, if you really want to read law then you must have resolute reasons and willingness to work your socks off.  Also contrary to popular belief, most lawyers in Singapore rarely go to court so if you were swayed by the lawyers in drama shows, go and research about the legal field in Singapore.   Majority of the students admitted to NUS Law are from the top tier JCs like RI,HCI and ACJC, this is because of the   stringent entry requirements. For an individual to be even called up for the aptitude tests, you need to have straight A's or failing that exception qualities through the discretionary admission(up to 10% are accepted though here).   The entry requirements for SMU Law is only slightly less demanding in terms of your academic results but nonetheless you need to have a excellent results. In general, there is more diversity in the JCs from which students are admitted.  In my opinion, it doesn't really matter which JC you go to except that you do (extremely) well!"

singapore,3ditxy,Vortael,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:56:29 2015 UTC,"Hello op, I have been inspired by your situation to stop lurking and create an account. It is after all, quite rare to see anyone who wants to take the same subject combi as me.  Anyway, transferring should not be too much of a problem, you'd just have to go through JAE all over again. I have many friends who have dropped out of JC and were able to get into poly through the following JAE, but your case quite unique so I can't be too sure.  However, you might want to note that it even with your L1R5 score, it might be quite difficult to get into NJ, NJ might have a partial 7 for Arts, meaning they'd accept those who with 9-2 or 10-3 ahead of you. (This is highly possible as I think NJ arts cut off point was 5 for JAE 2014, and it is rare for it drop by 2 full points, in fact 2016 might see their cop decrease again, who knows) That might be something you want to confirm with your NJ friends or maybe with the school itself. You should also check with NJ if they offer that subject combi, I think they do, but best to be safe as it is rare for anyone to take that particular combi (in AC i think I'm one of two j2s who happen to take it), so some schools might not be able to accommodate that, so do check with them.  If they don't, and you are really deadset on takin ELL, a potential choice might be ACJC, Or CJC as apart from these two, only rjc, HCi and rvhs offer ELL. You've got to be prepared for fucking lots of essays, because when it comes to A levels, youre gonna have to write 19 essays in total. 5 for ELL, 8 for History (6 seq,2 Sbq) and 6 for literature. You've got to be comfortable with this as the time constraints are really tight for all the essays. There will also be quite a lot of content to memorize, for example history has about 4x the content of 'o' levels (just a rough estimate). The intensity of the syllabus means that it will help if you have a genuine interest for the subjects, and even this interest will be severely tested. Fucking shag I tell you, but we do it for the love eh :)  Hope my reply is helpful and helps in your decision making!"

singapore,3dfmim,Varantain,2,Thu Jul 16 10:22:01 2015 UTC,"Hi, does anyone know whether it will be more economical to take Uber to the airport at 3AM, as opposed to a normal taxi? Quite noob here, I usually do a flag down. Also, family trip so probably need a larger vehicle. Will Uber have additional charges for luggage/surcharge to the airport? Thanks loads! :)"
singapore,3dfmim,gnomesrome,2,Thu Jul 16 14:41:15 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you are. If you live in the east near the airport, UberX will be comparable to a normal taxi, I think.  If you need a larger car, there's UberXL, but it's more expensive — not a surcharge, but a higher metered fare.  Let me know if you haven't used Uber before and would like the $20 off referral code, btw!"

singapore,3de23t,geraldc,19,Wed Jul 15 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"This isn't going to be a popular opinion but the difference is that a full set of accounts were submitted for this to be caught.   In the other case - accounts have been willfully incomplete, year after year after year.   In some sense, without giving AGO too much credit, there is a system that seems to be working."
singapore,3de23t,iscariot13,4,Wed Jul 15 15:55:06 2015 UTC,"The organisations audited in this report are all established organizations so it's to be expected that they have proper systems in place. In the WP situation, they were basically a startup since they had to set up everything from scratch. I'm also surprised it took then more than one year to get up to speed, but I don't know the details of setting up a town council from scratch so that might be a reasonable amount of time for all I know.  In the WP related parties situation, they had to set up their own company because no operator would work for a non-PAP TC. Then they got slapped with the ""related parties"" finding, so in the end they brought it in house. Personally I don't get why any TC outsources this stuff anyway? Why not just employ their own staff to do it?"
singapore,3de23t,irlando,2,Thu Jul 16 03:43:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm I think we need to look at the arguments from both sides regarding the plight of not having an operator working for them.  FMSS was established within a week from winning the elections (efficient? maybe. but surely enough to raise doubt?)   This was before they terminated the existing FM contract that had two years to go (yes the FM stated that they didn't want to continue but was this before or after they set up FMSS?)  Putting all that aside - they failed to submit complete state of accounts from 2011 to 2014. 2015 is still not submitted.   If AHPETC were not a town council, and subjected to the same rules applicable to a commercial company, they would have been pressed with more serious charges.  More importantly. If we look at the Town Council Act, Sylvia could have been fined for an amount for failing her duties as Chairman of said Town Council - effectively removing herself from position as MP."
singapore,3de23t,iscariot13,4,Thu Jul 16 04:07:24 2015 UTC,"The other difference is that PA is actually trying to rectify the lapses and the chairman in question has already stepped down.

singapore,3de23t,Wheat-gen-stein,9,Wed Jul 15 17:12:17 2015 UTC,Rubbish. PAP just terminated everything and left WP to start from scratch after losing Aljunied. WP had to do everything from scratch when it set up the town council.   Double standards is RIGHT.

Does that mean if opposition wins majority seats in parliament in the next GE, we need to give them another 20 years to see any improvement in Singapore because they need to 'start from scratch'?. Rome wasn't built in a day, but Aljunied is no Rome. If they can't handle one TC and one ward, how are they expected to run the country?"

For instance my boss tells me to buy bananas for the pantry, company will pay, and I bought those bananas and kept the receipt. Instead of getting the boss to reimburse me from the petty cash box (usual procedure), I just went to do it for myself, with the receipt as proof.   I'm supposed to get the money back, just that I violated the proper procedure by paying myself (i.e. approving my own expense), instead of waiting for my boss to do it.  There's no cheating involved, as the receipt and the accounting records should tally and there's no additional money missing.  If I had bought $10 dollars worth of bananas, didn't go through proper procedure, but took back $20 (i.e. approved my own expense), then there is dishonesty involved."

singapore,3defyo,sleepsoundxx,2,Thu Jul 16 15:46:39 2015 UTC,"Firstly, They went to the universities you stated above because the Kaplan diploma effectively acts as a foundation year for those universities i.e. they are initially limited to those universities.  Secondly, those who ended up at e.g. UWA, Monash etc. laterally transferred while they were already in the UK/AUS tertiary system where credit points can be transferred between universities. Transferring uni credits is more prevalent in the Aus tertiary system. For example, if one wanted to transfer from RMIT to Monash or UWA, one would have to maintain a Credit average for the first year and submit an application, nothing beyond that. This is slightly harder to do for many universities in the UK as transferring still requires that one holds the minimum A level grades despite having previous university experience.   Lastly, in reference to OP's question, which was specifically about Germany, i'll let the requirements speak for themselves. https://www.daad.de/deutschland/nach-deutschland/voraussetzungen/en/6017-admission-requirements/ and https://www.daad.de/deutschland/nach-deutschland/voraussetzungen/en/6017-admission-requirements/?id=17&ebene=2&submit=Show+%C2%BB Among the many other requirements, one is required to at least have an adequate understanding of the language.  I am not debating the fact that the universities stated above are decent universities, rather I am saying that holding a Kaplan diploma does somewhat limit one's choices hence I am answering OP's question. No they will not."

singapore,3defyo,iomur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:25:50 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, I can't accurately answer your question as i simply don't know.   From the webpage, it seems that "" international higher education entrance qualification(s)"" are the main factors of consideration and ""The type of main course allowed and whether you can take an assessment test for a university or a university of applied sciences also depends on the type of foreign qualifications you have."" I doubt that the Kaplan diploma is considered a "" international higher education entrance qualification"".   If you are truly interested in heading to Germany to study, I recommend doing actual thorough research on your options by giving the universities a ring and/or heading to the German embassy. From there you can plot out the path you need to take to get there.  I did have an Australian classmate who has gone to Germany for post-grad studies. However, having graduated, he holds an international qualification in addition to speaking fluent German. He also spent a semester as an exchange student in Germany. Tuition fees there are non-existent, he only had to pay about ~EU100 for admin fees.  I wish you the best of luck."

singapore,3dfses,Cluelxss,3,Wed Jul 15 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"Depends on what hall you got allocated. The newer halls (13+) will definitely be much better than staying at an apartment near NTU. Ntu is truly out of the way and even the nearest houses off campus is quite a significant walk so I wouldn't rely on the ""walk to school"" plan - you will get super sweaty and regret everything. In terms of sharing your room in Halls, they tend to do their best to pair you up with international students or those also on exchange. It's really up to you in the end, from my past experience the exchange students that rent out apartments with friends from their home uni tended to stick within their clique and didnt make as many local friends vs those that stayed in Halls."
singapore,3dfses,Lyriumghost,3,Thu Jul 16 01:48:42 2015 UTC,"I'm renting a whole unit nearby Pioneer MRT.  Current market price, you could get a whole unit for $2500 which usually includes 3 bedrooms and 2 toilets.   There are lots of housing around NTU but there is a free shuttle bus which fetches students from Pioneer MRT into NTU.  So although it looks further than housing estates near NTU, it is actually more convenient (imo) as it is near a MRT and has free shuttle bus service.  However it is not the only bus as there are bus services into NTU (number 179 and 190).  Walking in the humid weather of Singapore isn't the best of experience.   As for socializing, I don't think it is limited by where you stay. Sure there would be better opportunity, logically. But if you're good at socializing, it shouldn't be an issue. There's no entrance fee or curfew in NTU so you could come in anytime to hang out, play sports, and socialize."

Definitely easier to find like minded people that way  For housing, accomodation in NTU is really good and i would recommend you to take that choice. However, if you were to consider renting a room you might try to look from online rental portals and forums. Personally i recommend www.nestia.com as it worked well for me  Welcome to Singapore!"

Halls (where you'll be staying) have activities like night cycling and supper hops, and there'll be a joint Hall bash (where mostly horny freshmen from all the Halls go to a club lol) so maybe contact the Social Director of the Hall you're gonna be in to get more details. :)   Travelling to NTU is a bitch so if I were you I'd stick to on-campus housing."
singapore,3dfses,caiyixian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:14:01 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a NUS grad (I commuted to campus for one year & stayed in a Hall of Residence for the other three years), go for the full experience with campus housing. It was way more enriching for me. For the German, Danish & Japanese exchange students who stayed a semester each in our hostel, the stints also helped them break out of their shells.  Yes, the off-campus travelling can definitely be a daily grind, given the universities have their own ""rush hour"" crowds on mornings & evenings. It's kinda a regimented lifestyle in that sense, & your social circle is limited to your class or faculty mates (unless you take up extra curricular activities).  Hostel life is the complete opposite. In a Hall, you're have -- in this order -- your roommate (it's fine if both of you live separate lives), floor mates, block mates, & Hall mates to hang out with. Access to campus facilities is brilliant, allowing for participation in many non-academic activities. NTU hostelites can also go to Jurong Point & now Jurong East (JCube/Jem/Westgate/Big Box/IMM) to catch a movie & mall-shop. (Their NUS counterparts go to Clementi town centre & Holland Village.) One downside is locals typically head home for the weekend, so the hostels tend to be quite empty except for Malaysians & other foreign residents."

singapore,3dbori,snowysnowy,7,Wed Jul 15 09:43:57 2015 UTC,"A summary of the main point of the article, which does not seem to have been reflected in this thread thus far:  SMRT alone lacks the capacity to handle a large scale MRT disruption (large being 2 lines, apparently), necessitating activation of assets from other operators. Thus, the proposal is to have a larger scale contingency plan (at a national level) in place.  Summary ends While not a bad idea in itself, I'm worried that this hasn't already been in place already, which suggests that such a large failure wasn't within their expectations. Might they not know the true scale of their engineering issues?"
singapore,3dbori,lordshadowisle,2,Wed Jul 15 05:08:38 2015 UTC,"Adding on to your summary, a larger contingency plan is not addressing the root problem.   Aging equipment (whether it has been maintained sufficiently is a separate debate, but aging equipment breaking down more often as it ages is not up for debate), and the increasing burden on it (population strain, higher frequency) is not being addressed at all.   In other words, zero value-add from them."

It just serves to cloud the issue for the layman. Unfortunate or not, the masses don't care about technical information. They just want to have a confidence level that things are going to be fixed in a timely manner, and that at least part of the fare hikes go into a higher maintenance budget, instead of just 100% profit.  What I want to know is where has Desmond Kuek been? How many times has he shown his bloody face since the incident last week? One press conference?

If you are not able to cope: re nationalize. They've been racking up profits for years and now are calling help for tax payers to pay for the work they are supposed to do. How about you just properly manage the company and set aside money for maintenance instead of thinking about your profit margin?  Fuck you SMRT. This is like the American banks disaster: privatize profit, socialize losses. Hopefully the government will not bend down to that greed."

I was referring to a statement iterated back when the first rail issues were noted in 2010-2011.   However I still stand by my opinion that too much effort has gone into whitewashing the problems and not enough into actual working solutions.   The gut feel is that SMRT's approach to maintenence is reactive not proactive. When annual profits soar, salaries go up and yet the reliability of our public transport system keeps going down despite increasing govt. funding and subsidies to offset operating costs, it's very abrasive to hear figureheads state the obvious as if they have discovered the 3rd law of relativity and as another beautifully put it socialize liability while privatising profitability.  Not realising the system was in need of major maintenance is not a valid excuse. Having inherited the mantle from Saw PH  after her stepping down in such ignominious circumstances it'd be a poor CEO who didn't already identify this as a key area of development."

I can't answer for /u/mott3h, but this is my perception:   If they are taking proactive, preventative measures at all, they aren't doing a very good job from my position as a member of the public and a commuter, ie. customer. If they have a plan for improvement and preventative measures, then communicate it in a clear, concise manner, with milestones and deadlines. Celebrate these milestones when they're met, or at least communicate them. Put it on the news and make it visible to the public that they are actually doing something. Detractors are going to say shit like ""this kind of shit also want to celebrate and make big news for fuck?"" Fuck them. This is part of PR. Funnel some of the CEO's pay raises into hiring an actual PR firm/team/executive, so when breakdowns happen (and they have been happening), the company and its executives don't look like they have cocks in their mouths. When management doesn't even put in any effort to repair the firm's image, it really says a lot about how the company is being run, and the kind of hubris festering there."
singapore,3dbori,condor_gyros,0,Wed Jul 15 10:11:14 2015 UTC,"1) If they are taking proactive, preventative measures at all, they aren't doing a very good job from my position as a member of the public and a commuter, ie. customer.   Seriously how often does the public transport system breakdown. It really seems like a lot to you? I unfortunately can't find the article anymore but I recall reading a BBC article stating that in 2011, the London Underground was fully operational for a grand total of ONE day in the entire year. Out of 365 days, 364 days saw at least one portion of the London Underground breakdown. In the States, the lights and aircon in the train will just switch off in the middle of the journey as the train continues moving for no reason at all and commuters behave like it's perfectly normal for such a thing to happen.  Seriously, trains are machines. They're bound to breakdown. The frequency with which they're breaking down. Yes, we're not top in the world, Hong Kong's MTR system is always brought up when breakdowns occur with Singaporeans yelling WHY CAN'T WE BE LIKE THEM. Meanwhile Westerners would be looking at our system and yelling WHY CAN'T WE BE LIKE SINGAPORE. It's all a matter of perspective, and the fact that we deem train breakdowns to be a national tragedy says a lot about how good we have it."
singapore,3dbori,spvn,6,Wed Jul 15 12:50:41 2015 UTC,"National tragedy is a little hyperbolic, don't you think? I certainly don't see week-long, twelve-hour queues to slam SMRT or SBS. The state of public transportation is clearly an important matter for Singaporeans, and with good reason, considering that is what we are constantly being pushed to use, and personal vehicles are deliberately priced out of the reach of many. Just because Singaporeans supposedly have it good doesn't mean they should be perpetually content, and it certainly shouldn't understate any dissatisfaction they have. A person's happiness is relative to their personal experiences, not that of others.  Since we are comparing downwards, the Tube is the oldest subway network in the world, beginning service in the mid 19th century. By ""the States"", I'm guessing you're referring to the NYC subway, which started operations in 1904, train services run for 24 hours, covers the most stations in the world, as well as some of the longest distances. 13 of the 15 major subway systems in the States are also older than what Singapore has. The Singapore MRT network is about four decades old, and has experienced increasing disruptions in recent years, with the highest number in 2014, and arguably the worst being the one that happened last week.  Neither the Tube, nor any of the US subways claim to be world-class. Personally, I don't really care if we are or not, but if we are going to lay claim to that moniker, should the expectation not be that we far exceed their performance? Certainly, we should be striving to minimize breakdowns, instead of seeing them increase year on year. If commuters are comparing upwards to Hong Kong, Japan, or S.Korea, perhaps it should be seen as an opportunity to improve on what we currently have, and not simply downplayed as plain discontent."

Singapore's MRT is world class compared to most major cities. Compared to London, New York, etc., the MRT is rarely ever broken down. Those other systems have major disruptions all the time. Why are a few minor disruptions seen as the end of the world in Singapore but normal occurrences in other major cities?   because it's part of the Singapore brand: we used to be the ""everything works"" place. It is that simple.  You don't go to HK expecting even a risk of a disruption. Likewise we hope people don't even need to consider that in Singapore.  Then again you are also right in the sense that some people are really being too fussed about it; but as can be seen from the comments here it may stem from deeper issues.  edit: removed irrelevant bits."

I've never really driven here, but just observing the traffic at times makes me boil inside. Nobody appears to give even a slight fuck about anyone else, and people use the horn inappropriately, such as honking at elderly people crossing the pedestrian walks with green light and such.. I mean come on.    It unfortunately stems from the ""Me first"" culture I guess, but hot damn it's bad."

Furthermore, if you're going to slam on brakes, you should take a look in the mirrors to check if its clear.   Also doesn't explain why the dude veers into the 2nd lane. Just as the bike comes up.

I'm just suggesting that there is the possibility that this wasn't intentional and we shouldn't jump to conclusions.   If my brakes were not working or having issues, changing lanes might not be the smartest idea. There is a possibility the driver was trying to change lane to second lane, hit his brakes nothing happened, or perhaps brakes were really weak. The act of suddenly braking hard many time is actually something you are taught to do in the army if a) your brakes are not 'warmed up' (heavy vehicles) b) water is affecting your brake pad effectiveness (love them shitty landrovers).   Also, the fact that it was wet and he only started braking when he was in the tunnel (dry ground) makes me suspect this could have been the reason. As for driving off, he may have been deciding whether to stop completely in the fast lane or find some place to stop further up (like in car accidents, pretty common to go to the left most lane to talk).  You may be 100% sure it's malicious but based on my own driving experience I'm not so sure. I'm not denying that the possibility that it may have been malicious is there because Singapore has really fucked up drivers but going straight for pitchforks isn't the best response either."
singapore,3dbvlu,dashrandom,2,Wed Jul 15 05:46:19 2015 UTC,"There is a possibility the driver was trying to change lane to second lane, hit his brakes nothing happened, or perhaps brakes were really weak.    That's strange because immediately before the bike falls over, you can clearly see the butt of the car jerking upwards as it slows down rapidly, which means the brakes are working fine. You will also of course note that the car had zero problems staying in lane at a good speed without any brake application in the tunnel right up to the point where the bike comes close, at which point the driver magically loses control of his steering and brakes.    The act of suddenly braking hard many time is actually something you are taught to do in the army if a) your brakes are not 'warmed up' (heavy vehicles) b) water is affecting your brake pad effectiveness (love them shitty landrovers).   No, you don't suddenly brake hard many times. You gently tap the brake pedal to use the brake pads to rub off the water which has gathered on the surface inside the brake drum. Suddenly braking many times will get you into an accident, (and a well-deserved scolding from the instructor if you're in the army)."

Anticipating jam breaks is not part of everyday defensive riding. You can say they should be more careful, but there has to be a limit to how defensive you can be. If I have to ride like I'm expecting every car to swerve over and jam break on me, I rather not ride at all."
singapore,3dbvlu,Dreamwaltzer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:23:14 2015 UTC,"Look which lane the bike was in when it made contact with the car. If it was a car instead of a bike, the driver would be getting slammed for tailgating."
singapore,3dbvlu,iwantsmoothballs,3,Wed Jul 15 03:49:27 2015 UTC,"From what I see the bike was trying to lanesplit between the two cars when the brake-checker veered over to the lane markings.

singapore,3dbvlu,mwolfee,2,Wed Jul 15 04:17:05 2015 UTC,There's a reason lane splitting is illegal in other countries. As a motorcyclist you simply cannot take for granted that drivers are going to be constantly looking out for you or staying in their lane.

singapore,3dbvlu,mayotoast,5,Wed Jul 15 05:35:20 2015 UTC,"Don't get why you're being down voted for this. But this was my exact sentiments when watching the video.   Remember in BTT where we were told to keep a safe distance, one car length for every 30km/h or so. Yeah well even if it is not followed strictly this motorcycle should have slowed down more quickly instead of tailing so close behind once he noticed the car in front started braking.   Not saying the driver of the car is not at fault, but in this accident both parties have to shoulder some of the blame. If a safe distance was maintained this would probably not have happened.   Drive safe guys, remember that you drive to get to a destination, not to show off."
singapore,3dbvlu,natoahs,8,Wed Jul 15 06:52:07 2015 UTC,I'm assuming most of these people don't drive and hence don't fully understand. The driver is a cunt but the motorcyclist could definitely have avoided this particular accident by maintaining a safe distance and not lane splitting
singapore,3dbvlu,iwantsmoothballs,2,Wed Jul 15 05:29:26 2015 UTC,Yup definitely. I have seen so often motorcyclists victimizing themselves when they could have avoided the accident if they didn't behave like they deserved to drive the way they do.   Yes there are faggots on the road but you don't have to fight them just because you're driving a motorcycle. Doesn't do anyone good at the end of the day.

singapore,3ddg24,oklos,6,Wed Jul 15 12:12:06 2015 UTC,"Selection from the longish article:   I define small advanced economies as IMF advanced economies with populations of 10 million or less. Exhibit 1 lists these countries, together with their populations and per capita incomes. There are currently 35 IMF advanced economies of which 19 are small. At one level this is a diverse group of countries, with clear differences in geography, economic structure, and in some policy areas. Singapore looks clearly different from small countries like Denmark, Switzerland, and New Zealand. And Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand are the only countries from the Asia Pacific region; with the exception of Israel, all the other small advanced economies are from Europe.   Report looks at advanced economies that are small, small being defined as those with populations under 10 million.   ...small advanced economies share with Singapore a track-record of strong economic performance, intense engagement with globalisation, and a more volatile economic trajectory. ...Small countries tend to see the world in similar ways. In particular, the acute global exposures that small countries have mean that they face a strong competitive discipline, with an accompanying sense that they need to be distinctive in order to compete with other, larger economies. Small countries think and act on the basis that they are price takers, operating with little room for policy error, and need to adapt themselves to the realities of the external economic and political environment. This leads many small advanced economies to a shared approach to economic policy. Much more so than larger advanced economies that can rely more heavily on the domestic market, small advanced economies frequently develop a deliberate policy strategy to position themselves in the global economy. The exact nature of this strategy will vary according to the specifics of the local context, but examples include FDI attraction (Ireland, Singapore), R&D and innovation-led strategies (Finland, Israel, Switzerland), and the exploitation of natural resource-based comparative advantage (New Zealand, Norway). But irrespective of the specifics, there is consistently an integrated, coherent policy approach in small advanced economies: a deliberate approach to economic policy that is designed to position the country is much more of a focus than macro policy. Singapore is a distinctive example of this structured approach to economic policy, but this is also a characteristic of many other successful small advanced economies.   Such successful small economies generally accept that they have little control over external factors, and deliberately position themselves to specialise in a particular economic strategy.   A productivity-driven growth model is the only sustainable way for advanced economies to grow. Small advanced economies need to compete on the basis of knowledge and innovation to overcome the high cost structures that they have and to extract full value from the factors of production they have available. ...there is a significant gap between Singapore’s level of labour productivity and those of other successful small advanced economies. Indeed Singapore’s labour productivity level is one of the lowest among the small advanced economy group at $21/hour worked...Although the productivity levels of South Korea and Japan are often cited in the Singapore debate, it is the small advanced economies (and particularly those without significant natural resource endowments) that are the relevant productivity peer group for Singapore. There is a 40-50% gap between the productivity levels of leading small advanced economies and Singapore, a much bigger gap than the 10-20% productivity gap with respect to countries like Japan and South Korea. Singapore is at the income frontier despite relatively low levels of labour productivity because of the size of its labour input. A simple decomposition of GDP per capita into hours worked per capita and GDP per hour worked (Exhibit 11) shows clearly that Singapore is an outlier among its small country peers in terms of both low labour productivity ($21/hours worked, 78% of the small country average) and high hours worked (1473 hours/person, 167% of the small country average). Different models can be seen in countries like Sweden, Denmark and Ireland, with above average labour productivity levels and below average hours worked. There has been no meaningful convergence towards the productivity frontier by Singapore over the recent past. Singapore’s labour productivity growth over the past decade has been about average across the small country group (and indeed, reported productivity growth has been negative or flat since 2011). Singapore’s recent growth has come almost entirely from growth in hours worked.   Singapore's productivity is rather bad when compared to other small advanced economies, and our recent growth has come almost entirely from an increase in hours worked.   In most countries – and Singapore is no exception – sectors that are exposed to global competition have significantly higher levels of productivity than domestic sectors. Firms that export or invest abroad have to be operating at high levels of productivity in order to compete successfully in international markets. And inward FDI by MNCs often leads to improved productivity as those firms bring scale and specialisation, as well as leading technologies and management practices.  Singapore, as with other small countries like Ireland, has imported productivity growth through MNCs. But to generate higher levels of productivity, the focus needs to be broadened out so that more Singapore firms are expanding into international markets. In many small countries, supporting internationalisation by firms is a key part of the productivity agenda. A strong pipeline of firms growing into international markets is a strong contributor to high labour productivity levels and growth rates. Small country firms need to access international markets to get the required scale and specialisation for sustained productivity growth. Singapore has done many things in this regard; substantial investments in human capital and R&D as well as encouraging firms to invest in technology and other productive capital. But the international experience suggests that an even stronger focus on outward expansion of Singapore firms may be warranted, including actions deliberately aimed at removing firm-level constraints on international expansion.   Sectors exposed to international competition, especially those which expand to overseas markets, tend to be more productive, and the author suggests that this is where Singapore is lacking, even though efforts have been made in this area.   Singapore, along with many other successful small advanced economies, has a well-developed national economic strategy. But there are some differences between Singapore and other small countries in terms of the extent to which this is supported by an innovative private sector. ...Most small advanced economies score well in terms of commitment to policy foundations and a good business environment, as well as enabling factors such as human capital, infrastructure and publicly-funded R&D. This is true for Singapore as well, which routinely scores near the top of the various global rankings. But measures of firm-level competitiveness reveal (as in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Reports) that there are gaps between Singapore and other small advanced economies. Singapore ranks 19th in business sophistication, with poor scores for dimensions internal to the firm (such as extent of marketing, production process sophistication) as well as external to the firm (supplier networks). This contrasts markedly with higher-performing countries like Switzerland and the Nordics. Small advanced economies are notable for producing large numbers of successful global firms. Indeed, small countries tend to have a relatively high number of large MNCs per head of population (with some exceptions such as Israel and New Zealand). For example, Switzerland (Credit Suisse UBS, Novartis, Nestle); Denmark (Maersk, Carlsberg, Novo-Nordisk); Finland (Nokia, Kone); and the Netherlands (Unilever, Philips, Shell). Singapore, of course, has large firms like Singapore Airlines, DBS, Keppel, and so on. But many of Singapore’s large companies are government-linked, and retain formal and informal networks with the government. They operate on a commercial basis, but it is a different context from many other small countries. In terms of innovation, Singapore has a lower level of business R&D spending than other small advanced economies like Denmark, Finland, and Israel. Publicly-funded R&D is high and growing, but this is less the case for business-funded R&D. There are also various measures of the ‘efficiency’ of R&D spending, which capture the relationship between the investments in overall R&D and a range of metrics in terms of innovation output. Singapore performs poorly on these measures. This may be a timing issue, as R&D spending has ramped up quickly over the past decade. But it suggests that there are challenges in Singapore with respect to translating research and innovation into commercial outcomes.   Singapore has done top-down well, but bottom-up poorly. Those companies that have done well internationally have tended to be government-linked."
singapore,3ddg24,ihazaredditz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:44:39 2015 UTC,"I think LKY's response to these comparisons was basically to point out that most of these small countries are effectively integrated with much larger markets, giving them a lot more resources, both human and natural, to work with. That was particularly leveled at the Scandinavian/Nordic countries.  I think the most fair comparison would have to be Israel."

If you're lucky enough, some gallerist will pick your work up and want to market for you. If you self-market yourself, you'll have to think of rental cost of gallery space, or art fairs (such as affordable art fair). If you have been to affordable art fair (mind you, 'affordable' is from the range of $100-$10 000), galleries usually bring in works from all over the world, and there are people buying them. There are the art collectors who buy because they like the painting. There are also those that buy as an investment (value will go up base on the artist). Learned these info from a relative who is part-time gallerist, and art collector."

Instead you should be exploring ways to delay your enlistment and spend more time with your father. Stage IV lung cancer has very poor survival rate (it depends on the histologic subtype (i.e. how it appears under microscope) small cell, large cell, adenocarcinoma etc and where it has spread to (liver, bone, brain?)) - 12 months is really really optimistic, talk to your doctor for something for realistic.   I think you should actually aim to defer your A LEVELS (just talk to your principal). Take the rest of JC2 off, spend invaluable time caring for your father and with your family. Your studies CAN wait a year and I don't suppose you would be able to concentrate well and study for your A levels which would begin in 2-3 months when your father is lying in hospital/home/hospice. Upon deferment of your A levels you can also defer your impending enlistment from MINDEF.   Sorry to hear about your situation. I hope he is comfortable in his remaining time.

singapore,3d8q49,90DaysNCounting,4,Tue Jul 14 13:34:58 2015 UTC,"Fucked up.  I thought if immediate family pass away they are required to give time off?  To OP: Depending on where you go, there really are such people serving in our military. However in vast majority of units you should be able to find at least one superior officer who is not a complete jackass and who is not out to ruin lives. If your immediate officer is uncooperative just go to his immediate superior. They may make claims that you are ""jumping chain of command"" but that is nonsense if you have already spoken to the officer before him; you may get some trouble after that but all in all worth the risk given your situation.  Medical downgrades are really made purely for medical reasons. If you do not have any it will be troublesome (although there are some who fake psychiatric illness etc., possible but it will be a lot of trouble). Try the legit route first it is still more likely to get you something."
singapore,3d8q49,MrDLTE3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:34:54 2015 UTC,"Officially yes. But theres a limit. IIRC its like maybe a week or less. The guy wanted more for mourning or maybe he was just depressed over the passing of his dad and I kind of understand because not everyone handles grief the same way but this kinda of compassionate leave/off is quite under table and not official so yeah you know what I mean. Technically the commander did was right but morally, well yeah."
singapore,3d8q49,thunderskain,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:15:45 2015 UTC,Yes compassionate leave covers only 3 days. Any more you might have to use your annual leaves.
singapore,3d8q49,90DaysNCounting,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:42:23 2015 UTC,I'm sorry I did not read closely enough.  In that case I guess it was appropriate. I guess a more typical course of action would be to offer opportunity to use annual leave to extend to at least a week or so.  After all come to work and spend whole day crying and unable to work also no use.   But I don't doubt there are some really black hearted type who will act at all costs to deny extra leave.

singapore,3d8q49,lee_guan_you,30,Wed Jul 15 01:11:23 2015 UTC,"Although I appreciate the kind intentions of the community, I'm a bit pissed with the replies in this thread. Everybody seems to have come here to reminisce about their time in army and regurgitate their knowledge about the inner workings of the SAF, completely neglecting the fact that this guy has half a year away from NS. If you have served your time, you should know that you are subject to a fuck ton of regulations as an enlistee, and matters such as OP's case get complicated when he is supposed to be stuck on an offshore island for at least 9 weeks, not to mention confinement period. It is far better for him to act now, not when he enlists later on.  To OP, if you still have half a year to NS, disregard all the advice in this thread (for now, some of it is useful when you enlist) about talking to SAF commanders. Go for your upcoming Meet the People session, and seek help from MP. Remember to talk to your MP directly. With any luck you could defer your NS by a few months for compassionate reasons. Bring all supporting medical documents. I don't know if there are any laws or military directives that can help you, but it is better to try your luck now. Time is of the essence."
singapore,3d8q49,dashrandom,-4,Tue Jul 14 16:37:00 2015 UTC,"Never heard of any case where recruits were allowed to delay their enlistment because of such reason before. Would also strongly recommend against it because it would mean being placed into a different BMT batch than you were originally supposed to be assigned. Lastly, if you're not in NS yet, your MP may just ignore you and ask you to enlist before they help. Various reasons why he should enlist first.  Your anger at us giving him advice on how to apply for time off strange if you ask me, especially since that was his very question."
singapore,3d8q49,cameocamel,5,Tue Jul 14 23:39:55 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why you would prioritise OPs being in the assigned to his original bmt batch above spending time with his dying father. I think speaking to an MP is good advice.
singapore,3d8q49,lee_guan_you,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:34:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not very angry, just strongly annoyed. This guy is only 18 years old and is clearly confused about how to act in this troubling matter. He may not have the presence of mind to decide on the right course of action and ask the right questions. If we see that he is unaware of better options, we should point him the right way instead of blindly aiding him along the path of asking for time off during NS. That can come later if all else fails."
singapore,3d8q49,dashrandom,42,Wed Jul 15 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"Hi, 3SG(NS) here who used to deal with cases like this.  For BMT: Probably not. The unfortunate truth is that for BMT it's probably too troublesome for you to take the last ferry back and forth to see your dad as well. By the time you reach home, it's too late and he'll be asleep. When you leave home to make your way to Pasir Ris, he won't be up yet.  The greater chance you'll have is when you're posted to your unit. Talk to your superiors/instructors. If you want to be well prepared, gather some evidence for your superiors to make the story as believable as possible; doctor's note, insurance claim, whatever. Bring them to your superiors and ask if they can accomodate you. Even if they can't grant you time off every day, they will probably try to find some arrangement. Back when I was an instructor, I granted my trainees Nights Out twice a week. One trainee who was in a similar situation to you had a report-in timing of 0830Hrs the next day at the training centre. This is the most important part: If you are granted such a privilege, never ever turn up late or do anything that would lose your superior's trust in you. The trainee who managed to ""stay"" out those 2 nights a week showed up at 8.30am on the dot every single day.  As for the process, it's usually (from superior POV)   Get request Speak to OC/CO Conduct house visit to verify Grant time off   Whole process takes 1-2 weeks. If there is any blocking point in the situation, write to your MP, go down to your MP's office, whatever, get an MP letter. Those have quite a bit of power when it comes to these sort of situations (if you have a good disciplinary record and there's no special reason to bar you from visiting your dad)."
singapore,3d8q49,discmon,13,Tue Jul 14 12:03:38 2015 UTC,Thank you so much. I'll definitely do so once I enlist.
singapore,3d8q49,TRex_Eggs,-11,Tue Jul 14 12:53:58 2015 UTC,"Used to be a sgt as well. Yes, this is the procedure that you should be following. Don't try to downgrade your PES status, it may create trouble for you next time because of your medical history when you apply for jobs, go to university etc...  You're a great man, don't try to beat the system. Work within it, commanders are people too."
singapore,3d8q49,centurence,14,Tue Jul 14 12:20:56 2015 UTC,nobody outside the defence forces gives a flying fuck about PES status unless the interviewer is someone who has some misplaced pride in his NS stint or is a noob/unprepared at interviewing candidates.
singapore,3d8q49,dtwn,3,Tue Jul 14 13:39:32 2015 UTC,"No problems now, but when shit hits the fan and your records are as that, it MAY work against you.  No record is better than anything else."

singapore,3d8q49,mediumdeviation,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:58:13 2015 UTC,I was wondering about that also but that's just the minority. It doesn't have a big impact.
singapore,3d8q49,tjhan,2,Tue Jul 14 15:50:33 2015 UTC,"That's strange. The PES is Physical Employment Status, and each code corresponds to a very specific set of rules regarding the deployability of the soldier. It's not very useful outside of the army because of how specific those rules are, and I'm not even sure if your PES is considered restricted personal information - it's quite unlikely that a civilian employer can actually verify the PES grade of their employees"
singapore,3d8q49,hannorx,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:20:30 2015 UTC,"PES status only affects jobs like police, SPF  and of course the armed forces. If anything, PES E and C people don't have to do reservist, so that's a hella advantage."
singapore,3d8q49,loonylovegood,10,Tue Jul 14 16:22:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with the advice given by /u/nerradchoo and /u/lee_guan_you.   Since you are not yet an enlistee, have you explored either one of two options already mentioned by the above folks: (1) defer your A-levels by a year and consequently, your enlistment date to spend time with your dad or (2) talked to an MP about deferring your enlistment to a much later date? If you haven't yet, please do that.  I lost my mother to late stage cancer as well in 2010. I deferred my poly studies by a semester, and frankly, it was the best decision I made. The last few months of her life spent at the hospice were the happiest for me. Treasure the time you have left with him. I know it's hard, but make good memories. Remember him not as a sickly being, but as the father you knew before cancer defined him.  I hope you and your family find peace following his death. If you need to talk to someone, you can PM me. I'm happy to offer you my time online or over coffee. My treat. :)  In the meantime, stay strong. I'll be keeping you in my thoughts."

singapore,3d8q49,Dwarfield,4,Tue Jul 14 16:37:13 2015 UTC,Hi there!  My dad passed away with the same condition october last year . He was a smoker though.   He was diagnosed on the same year and died within 6 months. I was in singapore working and had to fly to japan for my dads chemotherapy. I made a post before asking for help on this sub.   You got to keep your chin up and make your dad happy all the time during his therapy. Will he be undergoing chemotherapy?
singapore,3d8q49,athlonaces,2,Tue Jul 14 17:00:31 2015 UTC,"First of all I am very sorry to read about your situation, I hope that your family will rally behind your father in these sad times. Now on to the reason you posted.  I hope that your studies are not overly affected by your father's illness. Although that may appear a bit heartless, but I am sure your dad will not want your grades to be affected by what's happening around you. I hope that you can persevere and do him proud in your upcoming A levels.  Now onto the army part of your question, calling relevant hotlines here who can actually help you will be very useful, rather than trying your luck with your commanders once you are in BMT. Speak to them and see if any arrangements can be made prior to enlistment, such as a letter for compassionate ""off"" days on top of the mandatory compassionate leave - which honestly would be too late. To clarify, ""off days"" are privileges awarded to you for good performance or other special circumstances. 14 days of leave are a right given to you once you're out of BMT, subject to approval of course.   Be sure to be proactive in getting your off-days and leaves in order before you enlist, by the time you're in Tekong, many things could take a long time to process. Even the simple task of acquiring an offpass takes 2 signatures by 2 seperate commanders on top of taking the ferry back (with special permission) to the main island.  I really hope I gave you some useful information and not just a wall of text. Stay strong!"
singapore,3d8q49,successannothingless,2,Tue Jul 14 11:44:44 2015 UTC,"I recommend talking to your MP, there's no harm and it's always good to have a letter. Barring that seek out anyone you know who is a general, like maybe a friend's dad or something. One phone call is all it takes from a general.  If you want to downgrade you can try, pm me."
singapore,3d8q49,davekor,2,Tue Jul 14 11:58:22 2015 UTC,"Hey there,  I was a plt cmd in both normal/pes e bmt and had personally witnessed cases of delayed enlistment, and this should be your best course of action if you can prove to the relevant authorities that your dad might pass very soon.    My suggestion for you is to gather whatever relevant documents that will support your claim and contact MINDEF. Should you hit a brick wall situation with them, seek help from your MP.  No matter how compassionate your commanders are, in a training school they are always many rigid rules and regulations that binds them. It is almost impossible for them to give you extended time off training to spend time with your dad. Servicemen on mandatory courses will always suffer from time inflexibility even if their commanders are willing to help.   PM me if you need more detailed information! I'll try my best to answer. Contacting MINDEF will be your best course of action now!  Stay strong!"
singapore,3d8q49,hokwongsoon,2,Tue Jul 14 14:00:39 2015 UTC,"Very sorry to hear about your Dad, my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family.   I know the uncertainty must be agonizing so I wanted to help with some advice and set the record straight for you on some things.   Firstly your PES status won't get downgraded based on this as it reflects your own physical proficiency. That being said PES doesn't confirm anything in terms of vocation or stay in/out. Plenty of PES B personnel find themselves in stay out jobs and vice versa.   At no point will a commander, wospec or officer, tell you they don't care. Post 2005 that simply doesn't happen anymore. And if it does and you report it, rest assured there will be very serious consequences for the person.   From day 1 of BMT you will be able to bring this up with your superiors. In fact you will have to attend mandatory interviews with your officers. They can't stop you from seeing a higher authority if you still have doubts (if your platoon commander tells you to f*** off, you can see the company commander, even the CO as long as you follow the chain of command).   Soldier's have clear-cut rights in the SAF and compassionate leave is one of them. I have personally witnessed NSFs flown back from overseas training in cases like these.    As already said here, most commanders are not monsters. Special arrangements can always be made for special circumstances, let them know you need help and know what you are asking for and why you think you need it. Once your in a unit, things become a lot more flexible. Again revert back to chain of command if in doubt.   Now the advice bit.   Call the SAF hotline since you have not enlisted yet and let them know of your situation. Take note of name, department and position of who you spoke to and write everything down.   The problem in this case is you won't be able to tell your dad's condition in five months. You won't get indefinite leave and changing enlistment dates around may not really help.   So unfortunately the best advice i can give you is:    Tell as many people as you can about your situation, SAF hotline, MP, Counselling (your school should have one i suggest this first, if not your community center will be able to point you in the right direction).  Always have supporting documentation. Get your Dad's doctors to write you a note. Obtain a letter from your MP if you decide to see them. Show that this is no joke.  Don't stress too much about NS. Its still a while away and like I've said there are procedures in place for people in your situation.  Do enjoy your time with your Dad and focus on school. Make him proud, give him TLC. Stop worrying and start cherishing.    I really hope this helps! Sorry if its blunt but i don't want you to have false hopes and get yourself into an even more upsetting position. Feel free to PM me if you need any clarifications on anything. I wish you the very best."
singapore,3d8q49,Hope83,2,Tue Jul 14 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"Make a request to talk to your direct officer in charge. If possible, try to make it an interview so there's some official black and white documentation of your family's situation. Always be respectful and polite.   Usually, the commanders are human and are usually quite understanding and will do their best to help you, either officially or through non-official means. This will probably come in the form of granting you extra day-passes and off days. Although they may even be kind enough to transfer you to a more ""lobo"" unit where you don't have to stay in-camp every day and can go home every night."

This is out of my area of expertise, but I am gonna suggest that when you go for the medical review, you bring this issue up and see whether the doc can do something, maybe excuse stay-in or something. If not, then I would suggest that you speak to your PC (Platoon Commander) when you enlist and let him do something about it.  I do believe that something can be done based on compassionate grounds.  Lastly, please do not try to handle this all on your own. I'm sure your friends would want to be there for you."

On the day I went to Tekong, my dad spoke to my OC to highlight to him the situation at home, and to confirm that I could leave in the event that a funeral was to take place.   Well about 1.5 weeks later the call came, and I was sent packing for the mainland in the middle of a PT session. Later on I heard that my dad demanding that I be released for the 3 days required for all the funeral processions, even though the officer said I was allowed for only 2 days max.   In this case, do get a fellow relative to tag along with you and explain the situation to your OC during enlistment day. They should understand."

We allowed a guy to head home and stay out to take care of his grandmother who just had an operation.    As long as you have supporting documents and your commanders are decent people(which they should be, or you should just up the chain of command), there's a really high chance you get to stay out(booking in by 7am, booking out at 5pm). Your OC should be able to have the power to do this.   To stay out for longer periods, you will need the permission from CO/DIV level(not too sure)"

As a few others have mentioned, it will differ from superior to superior, but if you have documentation to prove it, it'll help a lot! I know my officers/sergeants also visited the family of a fellow recruit who suffered a loss in the family. Like all organizations, you'll run into good and bad people in the SAF.   A lower PES is extremely unlikely to offer you more time, though I wonder if you could apply for a deferment on compassionate grounds. Maybe you could look into that.   All the best for your A's, and you're a great son!"
singapore,3d8q49,Azuredrak,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"Hi, ex ACC here just ord-ed.   1) Most units within the SAF should be very willing to help you in your situation so long as you put in the effort during training and gain your commander's trust. It might be a bit more difficult to arrange during BMT due to training issues but it should be much easier when you get out into a unit.   2) Staying out within the unit for the evening is a process that is approved by the CO of a unit. It can very easily be given for compassionate reasons, however, experience tells me that just wanting to spend time with him is usually not a good enough reason. Nights out and the weekends are for that purpose. Try to substantiate your point, especially if you are essential in the process of taking care of your father in both the medical and psychological sense.  The general process to ask for stayout is to tell your commander, who should direct to S1 branch to look for an investigating officer to do a short investigation and house visit to ascertain the facts before your CO makes the decision.  3) Downgrading in PES is probably not probable. There are no medical issues unless you might be psychologically affected by it. If you are, do call the SAF Hotline etc to speak to the SAF Counselors and such who can help you out in that area.   4) Perhaps my best advice is to just be a good soldier and ask your commanders for a favour. Most of the time, we all turn a blind eye when good soldiers bend the rules for reasonable reasons.   5) If your father is facing imminent death touchwood, there is a compassionate leave of 3 working days that you may apply even at BMT. Just tell your commanders and it should be immediate.   Whatever it is, I wouldn't worry too much, and focus on life now with your dad as well as study for your A Levels. Army will sort itself out after you enlist.  Good luck with everything!  Edit: some redditors have mentioned about deferring from enlistment altogether. That is IMO an extremely good idea and there has been precedence of this as well from my memory. Your local MP would be a good place to start the process. But start this process quickly, the report will take a while to complete and you don't want to run out of time. Get the medical reports prepared as well on your side."

IMO, if you can take the stress, go on and prove to your dad that you can do it. but if you can't, take a rest, let your school knows your problem and have them keep a secret if you do not want it to spread.  bring your family out, gathering, makan session, just hang out. take many photos. videos. tell your dad you love him, just say it man.. i would tell my dad i love him if it was my case even though my ego wont allow.."

I worked in a whisky bar for a while before leaving to study in the UK (British expat who grew up there) and I'd say from my visits to other bars as part of the job, many were frequented by mature and level headed people (who knew how to have a good time).   If you're a fan of whisky & spirits check out Fine Spirits by La Maison du Whisky, the guys I used to work with were awesome and if there's a French guy with long hair he'll make a killer cocktail for you. Some other spots I used to go too would be 1-Alitutude (min age 25 for males last I went) and great views of the city on a good night. Lantern for an outdoor lounge feel with food/cocktails. Lastly New Asia Bar which is I suppose leaning a little more towards the club feel. If you're really looking to club then yes, Kyo on a Thursday should be fun, that used to be their best night out.   Let me know if you'd like any other recommendations!"

I understand that you have already lied about having gone to the doctor and now backtracking is not a fun option, but it is a much easier way than trying to find a doctor who is willing to forgo professional integrity for some pocket change.   Admit to the fault. It is a simple case, requires minimal investigation, and your honesty will help mitigate the offence.

Some things to take note when you start gym-ing is to ensure you always have the proper form for any exercise you do, you can read it up online before u hit the gym. This is to prevent any injuries.   Always make sure your body have ample rest before your next gym session(like 1/2 days or when you dun feel that sore already). Since you are quite skinny, when you start gym-ing ensure you eat enough/well to make sure your body have nutrients to grow/repair.   Remember to train your cardio(running) too.

They laughed it off until someone said in a sarcastic manner ""stop masturbating with your balls"" (hats off to that guy, though I didn't actually see who said it. I almost burst into laughter). They left the train on the next station after that to probably catch the next train instead since they didn't walked over to the escalator and one of them sat on the large bench while the other two continues ""wanking"".  Even buses are not spared, and neither while queuing up for that soft serve at McDonald's.

The dance scene is small and closely knitted so it just spread like wildfire. I don't have solid evidence to this,but most of the guys running the jams are dance people and there's a crew that has their own brand of kendama here so I think it's proof enough to know they probably started it."

Not to say Japan is not good, it is great and i love the country, and this is definitely an isolated case. my point is singaporeans ought to have a more balanced view and stop going bananas over everything from Japan.   anyway back to the topic. In Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point, he studies the smoking patterns among teenagers and concludes that the culture kicked off because several 'cool kids' on the block were smoking. maybe the phenomenon is at work here too. a few cool kids started playing it on the playground (must be a somewhat centralized area) and next thing you know everybody is catching balls.

I can't remember the video but I remember watching one where the norm was for everyone to leave their slippers in a neat line and everybody honoured the slippers. That IMO is the optimal queuing system, I guess we have it in the form of those ""take a number"" digital systems."
singapore,3d8s5p,iemfi,3,Tue Jul 14 13:20:35 2015 UTC,Why?
singapore,3d8s5p,iemfi,2,Tue Jul 14 13:28:50 2015 UTC,That's kinda like using tissue paper packet to chope table.
singapore,3d8s5p,iemfi,5,Tue Jul 14 13:54:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same idea. Instead of having to make someone wait before they can order everyone gets to orders at the same time. The end result is the group finishes faster and more people get to use the table."
singapore,3d8s5p,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz,2,Tue Jul 14 14:34:50 2015 UTC,"Doubt it would work. It would be the same, one person come bring 20 pairs of slipper. What then?  It is a possible solution but in the kind of society we live in with so many scumbags, i have my doubts."
singapore,3d8s5p,iemfi,2,Tue Jul 14 14:44:14 2015 UTC,"Well that's still sub-optimal in that the table is wasted during queue time. And also the guy/girl sitting at the table can easily get someone to buy for him/her in the same order. If the arrangement is to start queuing before a table is found because there is a person running around looking for a table, then it can be more efficient than the tissue paper method.  I would prefer that people only start looking for tables when they are actually ready to eat. Probably will increase the capacity of the place by 30% or more (no table waste during queues, groups likely to break up if no table, more table sharing, shorter meal times due to less chats, less lingering), which may (or not, if somehow this kind of scheme attract even more people) improve the table availability in the first place.   Even better if people can avoid dirtying the tables and clear the trays.   But some people feel the need to eat in groups, use resource wasting methods to ensure that end (in the process making it harder for everyone else to find seats, which makes them employ said wasteful methods) and remove trays before eating (more likely to dirty tables), which is their prerogative unless the eating establishment has clear rules against doing such things. I just hope they aren't also the same people whining about how crowded the place is, how few cleaners there are, how dirty the tables are without considering the impact of their actions."
singapore,3d8s5p,KB-Jonsson,2,Tue Jul 14 14:57:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, ideally the table doesn't get wasted with queueing. But simply making people not queue until they get their food isn't realistic since there's a good chance some people end up with food but no table for a long time. So you would need some sort of system which could predict demand well and allow people to order food only if it knows there's going to be a table available. Not really practical..."
singapore,3d8s5p,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:48:52 2015 UTC,Why wouldnt that be realistic? Booking tables is a waste of free tables for people that already have their food. Dont be selfish
singapore,3d8s5p,iemfi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:05:06 2015 UTC,"If such a large increase in capacity still leads to a table availability problem, the location is under-served in the first place, and without such a scheme even more people will not find a seat at that timing in that place.  If a person is not confident of finding even a single seat (this will start to happen at around 90% of the improved capacity), he should go elsewhere before queuing. The amount of people turned away due to this will be lesser than the number turned away if the capacity of the place is 30+% smaller due to wasteful practices.  And it will also likely mean that the people turned away have a much higher chance of finding seats someplace else nearby, because the crowd must be coming from somewhere right?"
singapore,3d8s5p,chocfreckles,0,Thu Jul 16 06:27:38 2015 UTC,"Everyone is waiting for their turn to purchase food, so let's have ""friends buying for friends"" again. So when does the queue end?   Huh, what you talking? When the auntie make the food finish lah. That is ultimately the bottleneck for how fast you get your food.   If there's one lone soul without friends, does he/she have to wait for everyone to take their turns, then get his food? Same concept.   The thing is if the social norm becomes ""cannot chope place for friends"", the friends won't suddenly say ""aiya, don't eat lunch anymore lah, everyday ramadan"". They will still be there, queuing. The only difference is that people will take longer since someone needs to be the one choping the table."

Local prices for drinks range drastically but I live in the UK now and prices there are pretty similar when going out to somewhere nice. Bottle of beer at a local food court could be $5-7 while a beer at a nice bar will be $15-20+."

A pint is like $12 to start at beirwerks. I think that is pretty average. And mixed drinks are fucking nonsense, and they measure the poor. It is not like the states where just pour and say, yea, that seems decent. I had some dumb ass bartender at white nuts pour a 1/4 of the shaker on the counter and then have the audacity to charge the S$22 or what ever it was on saturday. Go to a real craft drink bar or whisky bar and he is going to blow his entire  stipend in a night.  wait, and what? $5? What hawker center is this? somewhere in Jerong West? The cheapest I have seen in central is 6.5 and that was in dhoby ghaut on Bencooline. And may I ask, what are you doing up at 4:30?.. I though I was the only night owl here."

singapore,3d9ihy,ocinus,3,Wed Jul 15 01:50:39 2015 UTC,"Food and literally food. Don't eat at restaurants, eat at all the hawker centers, try all the speciality food we have. When you get here, make some friends and ask them if there is anywhere nice to eat. I can grantee you, when you leave here, the thing you will miss the most is the food.   Also because Singapore is so small, it's easy to get to many places. I recommend visiting some historical, like the botanic garden.  Another thing is that since we are so small, it's fun to walk around the CBD area and you can cover a lot of ground in one day and discover a lot of cool and hidden places.   If you want, I can go walk with you and show you around. I love walking.   Also one of my favourite things that I've done is to go to the CBD to have dinner, then walk around around the area till the next morning and take the first train home. I've done it once and it was interesting walking along the most crowded area in singapore at night seeing it practically deserted of cars and people. Another thing you can do is to walk from one end of the country to the other end (this was what my sis did) it would take you roughly 12 or so hours but it's fun.   Because I'm going to be honest, most tourist attractions like sentosa or Singapore flyer are expensive and only worth it if you come only once a year here. There is a lot of shopping to do in singapore but like wise, it's expensive (at least to me), so I rather do something else cheap. I'm not saying you shouldn't go for these attractions, but if you have the cash; go for it."
singapore,3d9ihy,Probably_daydreaming,2,Wed Jul 15 01:37:10 2015 UTC,"Take a walk. Don’t go out with a place in mind, just wander and see where you end up. Singapore is a nice place to explore, especially in Chinatown/tanjong pagar/city area"
singapore,3d9ihy,corgiofpeace,2,Wed Jul 15 00:43:51 2015 UTC,"The great thing about Singapore is that you can get almost anywhere on the island on public transport. So if you're feeling especially adventurous you could actually just hop onto a train or a bus and see where it takes you. You won't get too lost in Singapore anyways - it's that small.  Anyways, assuming you're not absolutely loaded with cash to spend, exploring Singapore's food courts will probably give you the most bang for your buck. Off the top of my head, Simpang and Blk 85 in the East are places with a high concentration of pretty great food. Chomp Chomp in the Northeast is also a great. Nearer to NUS, where you're headed to, there are some pretty good tze char (google it) places you  could try - I'm in the more remote NTU so I'm sure your peers in NUS will be better able to recommend those to you.   Lastly, Singapore is pretty close to both Malaysia and Indonesia, so you could head towards Johor and Batam respectively for a whole different experience."

Just hop on a train to anywhere you want on the map (Singapore is so small that you can easily make your way back), find a hawker centre and eat your fill. Singapore has the best food.   Drinks are definitely more on the pricey side, but it depends where you go. You can go check out some thai discos at orchard towers. It's relatively cheaper, and quite an interesting experience. If you want more recommendations just PM me or something, students know where all the cheap stuff are at. ;)  If you're into exploring the different cultures in Singapore, head to Little India/ Chinatown etc. You should check out Haji Lane too.

singapore,3d7zw3,CaiPngIsLife,34,Tue Jul 14 07:21:59 2015 UTC,Gerrymandering is the reason why the electoral boundaries are so skewed. They most likely use some sort of algorithm that makes use of past voting results to determine the best fit line that needs to be drawn in order for a certain party to win. I've heard of some of my friends being in 3 different GRCs despite never having moved from their house for a couple of decades.  If im not wrong it can be used to make a 40% minority voting into a 60% majority result  I also live in Serangoon but am part of marine parade GRC. My best friend who lives across lorong chuan votes for aljunied GRC
singapore,3d7zw3,R_Creation,2,Tue Jul 14 06:11:55 2015 UTC,"If im not wrong it can be used to make a 40% minority voting into a 60% majority result   Not exactly wrong, but the way it works is that it dilutes the opposition votes by throwing into noted ""strongholds"".  For context:  (Assuming 2 neighbouring GRCs have the same voting population.)  A had a 65:35 result.  B had a 85:15 result.  Based on the results, GRC A has a higher chance of going over to the opposition. One way to prevent that is to redraw the election boundaries to include some of the housing estates which had a tendency to vote opposition into GRC B. So let's assume that an undesirable 10% of A is transferred to B, the ratio would have easily become 65:25 for A and 85:25 for B. Reworking those ratios would get us to 72:28 and 77:23 respectively. As you can see, B is able to absorb the opposition without losing too much of it's overall score, and at the same time improving the score of A while maintaining the same number of proposition voters.  I'll admit, this is an extremely simplified manner of calculating the effects of gerrymandering and does not take into consideration the effects of new voters, relocation of previous voters, the fact that no 2 GRCs have the same voting population etc. But I hope this helps to demonstrate how the constant redrawing of electoral boundaries could potentially affect the results of an election"
singapore,3d7zw3,potatetoe_tractor,9,Wed Jul 15 03:21:58 2015 UTC,"What do they use to draw the boundaries?   Anything but crayons and magic markers. But seriously, with lots of data from sources undisclosed to the general populace. *wears tinfoil hat*"
singapore,3d7zw3,tsukuruu,8,Tue Jul 14 06:42:07 2015 UTC,"No tinfoil hat necessary, just a willingness to look beyond immediate surface details.  How does a party that once propagandised heavily about transparency have decisions made that are based on unjustifiably secret data? If you can't evaluate the data for yourself, as a citizen and a voter, does it really matter if decisions based on that data are arrived at transparently? And why doesn't it bother more people that they haven't even bothered to go through the motions on that?  It's legal because the Minister and Inner Party do it. That's hardly anybody's idea of a parliamentary republic with open, free and fair elections operating under the rule of law. If we're to be an absolute hereditary kleptocracy, let's at least be open about it — to ourselves and to our foreign investors."
singapore,3d7zw3,jdickey,7,Tue Jul 14 17:33:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, really strange (or not) that they are so uptight about this.  Our Government is usually quite open when empirical data is used to calculate stuff (like the PM's pay)."

Ang Mo Kio took in a part of Cheng San as well.  If PAP were to pull the same shit again, it would be like Potong Pasir being absorbed into ToaPayoh/Bishan GRC.  till the day our elections department is fully independent, gerrymandering is the most likely answer."

singapore,3d7zw3,ceddya,7,Tue Jul 14 09:09:19 2015 UTC,"I agree that first-past-the-post benefits PAP. That's very clear.  Gerrymandering refers specifically to the drawing of electoral boundaries to disperse support of opposition parties and prevent them from winning seats. I don't believe that's occurring.  The usual argument 'district A is not in GRC A' is not an argument in itself for gerrymandering. For gerrymandering - district A has to be more pro-opposition and split from a GRC leaning opposition to reduce opposition support, or more pro-PAP and included in a GRC leaning opposition to increase PAP support. This sort of micro-management would eke out a percentage point or two. The PAP is generally winning by 10% or more.  There's another usual argument - district A is across the road from district B and both are in different GRCs. There are always going to be some roads which divide GRCs, are we going to giggle about gerrymandering over all these roads?  It's just really bizarre to me how so many people like to claim widespread gerrymandering. That's really not the reason the opposition is losing.  Get your act together and consolidate your resources into a single huge centre-left party. Now that will really send the PAP into a panic. Squealing about gerrymandering is useless."

Also it's not like Singapore is diverse enough to have agricultural and urban regions where each group's concerns are vastly different."

singapore,3d7zw3,irlando,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:43:43 2015 UTC,"The area matters, the names just highlight that you have constituencies which are removed from each other being treated as if they are related. Is your issue with the other comments that you don't think gerrymandering is happening (i.e. you think these disparate areas are not being grouped together to gain some meagre advantage), or that you think it's happening but that it is irrelevant because it's not massively changing the outcome of the elections?"
singapore,3d7zw3,sg_no_comment,3,Tue Jul 14 10:34:30 2015 UTC,"The areas matter, absolutely. The names can clue you in that something is not right, but people treat names as some sort of proof that gerrymandering is occurring. That irritates me because this is the source of a lot of vitriol and not a lot of critical thinking.  Whether any actual gerrymandering occurs, and whether it matters - honest discussions don't irritate me. I'm usually happy to learn. It was from here that I learnt about the history of Anson, here that someone pointed out that younger voters lean opposition, and Punggol-Seng Kang has many young voters and is oddly divided. These are valid points to think about. Complaining about GRC names is not."

You're a 40 year old dude, who probably never banged another chick aside from your partner who is your first, and now you're seeking a FWB relationship.  The problem is not FWB, its the fact that you're in a marriage and you're seeking to cheat on your wife. Of course everyone will say ""hmm dude I dont think this is a good idea""  And replacing FWB with a prostitute doesnt change the fact you're seeking to cheat on your wife.

No decent person is going to say go for it. It's cheating on your spouse.  Whatever the reasons to why you end up being in this marriage, it was your own choice to sign on the dotted line.   If you are finding your sex life unsatisfactory, be mature enough to communicate with your wife. Seek marriage counselling if required. Or if you really want to get your sexual needs met cos you believe nothing will change even after you communicate with her, then so be it. But for goodness sake, a grown MARRIED man asking for approval online whether you should go for a fwb/paid relieve just smacks of plain absurdity.   So in conclusion, you are not a fool to want to have your sexual desires met. You are however a ridiculous fool to think that thinking with your head down there will get approval and validation here."

From an independent point of view, the change could have been to streamline the appointment of board members, imagine the hassle going to so many different parties to appoint members.

So basically, unless you are head hunted or posted here, you are not likely to get an offer here, nor get your permit approved."

singapore,3d9uw0,mayotoast,6,Tue Jul 14 17:02:57 2015 UTC,"Ok, a couple days old news that I've just came across. Can't disagree with it.   Since the last AMA, I'm no longer suggesting for anyone to drive for Uber / Grab Car on a part time basis anymore.   Also since joining, I've also started noticing more hate from cabbies, and have removed all Uber and Grab decals from my own vehicle. Here is a picture taken by another Grab/Uber driver.  As usual, feel free to ask me anything with regards to GC/Uber, getting many PMs on the same questions, might as well update on the situation for aspiring drivers and new riders based on recent changes."
singapore,3d9uw0,mrmeowman,9,Tue Jul 14 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"Then cabbies just need to step up their game I guess. I recently started using UberX, and I don't think I'm going to go back. The rating system makes everyone accountable for their actions, and I feel that most rides I've been on so far have been pleasant – the mood is more cheerful with Uber drivers, and the driving much safer.   I certainly haven't had to deal with the stupid frustration of 'Ah, where you wan go?' or cabbies 'changing shift' to Chinatown when I'm in Chinatown at 10.30pm at night. Or cabbies who force their way through three lanes of traffic just to get that slight edge over the other cars on the road.   I'm glad the game has changed. Now can someone step up and disrupt the telco industry too please?"
singapore,3d9uw0,jerry_182,7,Wed Jul 15 01:19:47 2015 UTC,"To add on to your points, I feel like taxi drivers just want to complain and not do anything about it (just like we Singaporeans are famous for).   Why do they wonder why people prefer Uber over regular taxis? Ubers don't ""mysteriously"" disappear from 1130pm onwards until 12am just to earn that extra midnight surcharge; Ubers don't decide that your destination is too far away and they don't want to travel there; Ubers don't swerve across lanes drive recklessly to overtake a couple cars.   It's a mystery!"

singapore,3d9uw0,dashrandom,4,Wed Jul 15 07:21:02 2015 UTC,"Had a conversation with some taxi uncles about this. Their hate seems to stem from the fact that they think uber is an illegal business model where people are allowed to use their own private cars to act as taxis. Even when I explained to them that a vehicle with commercial insurance is required and that if that is a personal car, they are basically paying commercial insurance and won't be covered for 'personal' accidents when not on the job, some of them still refused to believe me with the ""No la, uncle know better than you"" attitude.   It's hard to change the mindset of uncles who have been working under a specific system for so long that anything that disrupts it and competes with them for customers is seen as 'incorrect' and 'illegal'. And not to mention they are fucking stubborn."

singapore,3d9uw0,Godcheela,2,Tue Jul 14 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"Do you think Uber/GC/whatever drivers should be subject to the same regulations as taxi drivers and require a taxi license, or are they distinct?"
singapore,3d9uw0,Godcheela,4,Tue Jul 14 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"If Uber/Gc drivers are  subejected to the same regulation, does that mean they can pick up customers on the street just like taxi operators? If so, yeap pls do.   If not, cut some slack and come up with a private chauffeur licence scheme, that will ensure the driver is being monitored and have safe driving techniques. The rating system though, really do monitor better than LTA licensing of cab drivers and only investigate upon serious allegations and complains.  I am all for regulation so long as it serves its purpose in improving passenger safety."

It is the exact opposite of where you want to be as a foreign guest of Singapore.  A couple German morons learned their lesson the hard way after defacing an MRT train and then fleeing to Malaysian then Thailand.  The long arm of the Singaporean law got them anyhow and now they're serving 9 months in jail + 3 lashes.

singapore,3d6fr6,androktonos,3,Tue Jul 14 11:39:10 2015 UTC,"There's reasonable rates at Healing Touch, several outlets all over the city. http://www.healingtouchspa.com/   And if you're only looking for foot massage/reflexology People's Park Complex in Chinatown is great. Choose the ones with both men and women masseuse, the old ones, those tend not to be dodgy. If it's all covered up ie there's frosted glass and it looks dark and staffed by women wearing tight dresses then they're the ones offering special services.   Batam is great for a spa weekend, there's several packaged deals if you want to go as a couple or even a day trip with girlfriends. My mum does it all the time and they've got a chauffeur and all, and it's still cheaper than a full day spa in Singapore. I've gone for spa visits all over the region and I've yet to encounter any shady services, but I'm a solo female traveller anyway so I stick to places that look alright and follow my gut. It's not true that ""happy endings"" are in every spot and that every place in say Thailand/Vietnam/Indonesia are dodgy, that's just dudes being creepy dudes. As long as you respect the place, the unwritten rules and see that people are just trying to make a living, you won't be filched."
singapore,3d6fr6,dreadpiratewombat,4,Tue Jul 14 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"Oh hey, something further down the thread today reminded me of a challenging part of having moved to Asia.  You will, for the first few months, experience some odd gastro-intestinal issues while your body adjusts to the new constellation of microorganisms that live in this part of the world.  This is entirely normal and it has nothing to do with how clean the water or food are here.  Stock up on a little Peptol Bismol and charcoal pills when you first get here and expect to occasionally need an urgent visit to the toilet."

singapore,3d6fr6,rainforest_runner,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:25:43 2015 UTC,"Spas in Singapore are truly expensive...a simple shoulder massage can go to 50 SGD/hour or so. More expensive when you go for the full treatment. It can go up to $300-$400.   It's way cheaper when you go abroad to other SEA countries, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia or Indonesia.  I don't know how the rates are in Batam, Indonesia (although I heard it was 20 SGD for a full-body massage) But when I was vacationing to Yogyakarta with my gf at the time in 2014, we went for a couple's massage which include full body, sauna, facial, manicure and pedicure, and it only cost both of us 30 SGD.  So that's how it is!  The guys and I went to HCMC recently for a bachelor's weekend and finding a suit as well. We went for a couple of massages along the way...  Don't worry, they are all (usually) clean massages. Although they'd ask for tips, which would probably cost you around the same amount as how much you paid for the service. Just gotta be firm with them though, they can beg for it with puppy dog eyes...  Get a leash for your boyfriend though! LOL"

It's been a year since I was warded at imh and at this point I don't know if I'm any better,  then again I stopped going for appointments since they never called me back after missing one, and then me just hating that place. Always feel like doctors are thinking that I'm faking something,  because I 'look normal'.   Oh well. On a slightly happier note I unlocked Kongo in World of Warships yesterday. Got rekt I'm the first match I  played though."

It may take a while to find the ideal psych for you, but don't give up! Try others if your personal situation allows for it :)  ...also ZEN HOUMON FIYAHHH"

singapore,3d6fr6,crisisd,3,Tue Jul 14 01:48:57 2015 UTC,"Hey man, everyone has guilt from time to time, but I am not sure if you have more of it, so I don't want to presume, and say that it's a phase or something.  I know that maybe you feel that you aren't a good friend, but socialising takes a lot of practice. And if you are really guilty about it, you can simply try apologizing to them. Won't solve matters, but at least you tried, and hopefully it brings you closure.  Please just let it go.  In fact, the people who you thought you hurt may have already moved past it, so there is no point dwelling on it.  If anything else, exercise and sunshine may do you some good. Meditation may help as well.  Not going to tell you to 'just move past it', but I think it's really important that you try to.  I'm not you, so I can't speak for you, but dwelling on guilt isn't going to make things better."

singapore,3d6fr6,rainforest_runner,3,Tue Jul 14 15:44:06 2015 UTC,"Yo redditors, I've had a blast on climbing yesterday, and will be making it into a weekly thing with my friend (although perhaps not Climb Central)  We're both committing to each other to be each other's accountability partners.   SMART Goals for each of us are simple and tangible. The only opponents are ourselves.  Me, to finish ALL the challenges of the Spartan race in November (no failures/burpess to be executed)  Him, to actually reach the top of one of the climbing walls. (Out of the 20 times we were climbing, I've climbed like 14 times. And the 6 that he was climbing, he couldn't go more than 5 meters...)   The method, is to meet twice a week. One time for climbing, one time for body conditioning, and cardio is to be done by ourselves at anytime. Secondary goal is that we're gonna be way fitter than our current sedentary lifestyle's body is now, so definitely gonna be healthier as well (food is another thing, but that's another goal)  Both of us have standard practices every day, me, starting with planking 60 secs and 30 burpess every day, him with pull ups and...stuff (he still doesn't want to elaborate)  Deadline will be the Sunday of my Spartan Race, November 15, 2015.  Currently still trying to figure out how to review our progress...  Anybody (especially fitness warriors) got any other advice to make this work?"

singapore,3d6fr6,acsim,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:33:00 2015 UTC,"You just do you and most importantly, enjoy it. Slowly ramp up and adjust your work out as your fitness gets better. That's really all there is to it. Same goes with diets: change one or two food items per week/month. There's no magic workout or diets.   Those people whom you'll see doing superbly well for the Spartan race, don't be surprised if they tell you they've been working out regularly for years.   So don't treat it like an exam, i.e. Having a deadline and such. Fitness is a habit. No point trying to be fit until the Spartan race get done with it and slack off. You wanna be a beast everyday all-year-round.  I sense that you are just starting out I suggest you avoid premature optimization. Some people treat their workouts like punishment for pigging out yesterday / last week.. Then start on workout routines - 5x5, p90x - and diets that their body haven't adjusted too. Happens to people who just see their first gains too.   Slowly working your way up will help prevent waking up sore as fuck and compounding the misery by eating blend tasting chicken later in the day. Unless you're a misochist, it's a sure fire way to demoralize yourself and have your workout plans fall apart."

If you don't have friends(I'm sorry ) or they are lazy asses. I suggest listening to podcast of your interest. If you want I can recommend you some.

Maybe the next person you meet will enlighten you in some ways or you able to find something that you like to do.   If teaching is truly what you want to do, then don't give up.

Of course the more the world open its knowledge to the common man the more we revolutionize our culture.   The Malay culture as you know it derives from Hinduism and a lot of the cultural similarities are borrowed from South India or Thailand. I wont go deep into the history of Majapahit and what ever it is. Our culture from being a mix of Hinduism and Arabic Culture in the sphere of Islam is an identity for us. Recently the spread of Wahhabism in Malaysia has sparked a lot of controversy where some of our customs that was brought over from Hinduism was frowned upon. The strict rule of adapting to hadiths and demonizing our culture that means nothing but customs for example a sign of respect or hospitality or devotion a good example u/shaftronics just mentioned. Ask a Mufti and they will say its nothing wrong with these traditional customs as long as it does not misrepresent Islam.. Just that there are always purist who thinks anything that is hot in the Hadith is basically Haram.  While most of us are in this to follow the ways of Prophet Mohamed PBUH in terms of clothing and stuff, there's nothing wrong with that. But some of them who really adapt to Arabic culture with everything they got is pretty pretentious..   I'm basically Javanese by blood and we still adhere to some of the Javanese customs. The Malay culture is slowly phasing out and I think its pretty scary to know. I hope we especially Singaporean Malays don't lose our identity and get swallowed by the Arabisation."

We had racial riots in our history. To reduce friction, they did not tell Singaporeans to ignore race. Instead, we sort of celebrated it. We told ourselves that we are a melting pot. We recognise that there are different races in Singapore. We taught one another our differences. We are sensitive to being different.

Before Islam was the prevalent Religion for Malays, most Malays practiced various other religions, such as Hinduism. Inevitably, a lot of cultural norms stemmed from religious norms or rites.  There's still quite the debate going on about Malay ""culture"" and Islamic norms. For example, the practice of Malay weddings. Many still have antiquated rites like splashing water on the bride and groom with banana leaves,  throwing rice, and even the payment of dowry is being questioned.  Also, the usage of Iftar and Solat isn't wrong. Sembahyang or Sembah is a general word for worship. Solat is specifically Muslim prayers.  It's an interesting discussion, but personally, I don't really care. Religion should come first, and any antiquated practices that have roots from a previous religion should be phased out."

I don't mind some Arabic words when it makes sense. Iftar is short and sweet and so is Solat.

singapore,3d3per,g_77,7,Mon Jul 13 08:58:41 2015 UTC,"I think you have a very valid question, and its interesting but not surprising you were down voted for it.  I will try to explain from a non religious point of view which will possibly answer your question from your point view but shaftronics will possibly not appreciate my answer. Hopefully my answer will assist in providing some insight into why this is so and the difference of opinion.  You are asking for a reason for a religious action or point of view. However the corner stone of religion is faith and not reason or rationality. Delving into this statement what you will find common in religion in general is reference to something super natural often defined as something spiritual. In Ibrahimic religions like Islam that reference is to god or Allah. That is something not of this universe, and something specifically that we are unable to explain or predict and is not dependent on us, but instead often implied may have absolute power over us. Generally implied is it is something that science cannot predict where science is the methodology of explaining causality and relation of effects within our universe and thus the term super natural. Thus the super natural thing is often taken as non causal from our point of view.  Thus faith is a corner stone of super natural concepts because by definition you cannot explicitly prove it. If you were able to prove it then faith would not be required. Faith is thus used as a concept to propagate such beliefs and thus tends to be a very strong element in religion. Often implied or explicitly stated is that a follower who does not have faith is bad, specifically for their lack of faith. Strong faith is taken as a sign of high religiousness which is associated with a high level of morality from the religious point of view and thus encouraged via a feedback cycle within follower or those who they wish to follow their faith. Remember religion is usually fairly specific with regards to its implication of good morality with religiousness and belief or ""faith"".  From a scientific point of view this tends to bring about a problem because a key concept for the propagation of religion is that you must believe and not question it.Thus if a religious leader presents an idea, followers tend to take on that idea with out questioning it because the leader can use their questioning as  and indicator of a lack of faith and thus condemning the follower. Thus a culture of not questioning things tends to propagate through religious communities. When there is a large number of religious followers, each will propagate their own independent values as being religious and that those who do not follow their values as lacking faith. Thus various random traditions tend to get mixed with religion and its hard to distinguish what is religion and what is not. It is also hard because the lack of reasoning means there may be no valid reason or interpretation, because the cornerstone is not reasoning or rationality but faith. Thus many contradictions often propagate through religious communities and their values tend to take a random walk. In the case of the middle east it is significantly responsible for the current violent anarchy like or barbaric situation in a large number of their states. In the Philippines catholic obsession with not using condoms has largely led to massive population growth and staggering poverty.  From a scientific point of view we know that most if not all religious texts have massive amounts of contradictory information in them like for example of creation of the world in 6 days at the extremes. There simply was not the information available at the time of their writing for them to be accurate and valid and thus they tend to reflect local knowledge or beliefs where they were written.  Thus the only ways for their followers to agree to follow them is via faith, because if reasoning and rationality or criticality were encouraged then the texts would not propagate as a valid belief due to the number of contradictions within them.  Thus your question to a follower why must religion supersede old customs doesn't really make sense from their point of view. From their point of view faith in religion is good and thus must supersede all else is the obvious answer regardless of repercussion to local customs that may have value that they don't consciously recognize. An example of this is that women must cover up in Islam. The middle east is a very high sun brightness climate where people from light skin color regions and dark skin color regions are immigrating too historically. Without covering up nearly all the light skinned people would like die of skin cancer and most people dont realize this significance of this. To give reference to this, a similar climate in Australia and over 60% of white Australians currently get skin cancer within their life. Without modern medicine Australia would have a massive skin cancer death toll and even with modern medicine still does have a very significant death rate from skin cancer from sun exposure.  Thus for example it is fairly obvious why the religion of islam in the middle east evolved to have an obsession with covering up(note most Arab men also tend to cover up a lot) and not covering up is thus propagated by cultures emminating from the middle east as bad.  This however may create problems with people with darker tones of skin who do not eat fish(high in vitamin D) and do follow islam as they will likely not receieve enough vitamin D. Interestingly low vitamin d in pregnant mothers has been shown in a number of studies(which have nothing to do with islam) to be correlated with schizophrenia in babies. Thus darker skin populations may likely have problems with adopting islam(unless they have high fish/vit d diets) as they need more sun exposure to adsorb sufficient vitamin d.  This may also be related to the odd(violet behavior) of islam in northern African countries for example where often darker skin Africans tend to adopt Christianity while Arabs tend to adopt Islam more aggressively. Obviously this later part is hard to prove and there are many other issues complicating things but i would say science tends to point to it as an implicating factor or at least something as food for thought or in need of more study."
singapore,3d3per,dashrandom,2,Mon Jul 13 09:52:03 2015 UTC,"Very thorough and well-thought out answer. Just some additional questions:   Thus your question to a follower why must religion supersede old customs doesn't really make sense from their point of view. From their point of view faith in religion is good and thus must supersede all else is the obvious answer regardless of repercussion to local customs that may have value that they don't consciously recognize.   If they don't contradict nor complement each other, but are ""neutral"", is there any reason for them not to co-exist?  Also, while it may be a stretch to say this, I find that even if there is a custom that contradicts religion or at least some aspects of it, as long as it greatly and directly benefits said practitioners of religion, they tend to disregard it's blasphemous quality. An example I'd quote is Chinese Christians and Chinese New Year. The root of Chinese New Year is rooted in superstition and if you look really far back, it has religious implications, but many Chinese Christians still choose to celebrate it as part of Chinese culture. I'm guessing Hong Baos and good food are too good to pass up.  Really fascinating phenomena if you ask me..."
singapore,3d3per,g_77,6,Mon Jul 13 10:42:53 2015 UTC,"Yes its a very interesting aspect of humanity. I often find myself in disbelief at the results, but at the same time when I think about it a bit more in depth I suspect its a highly probable state or set of states for an evolving species. While historically people have been taught that ""life"" or consciousness is special and somehow different to the physical world, I have concluded somewhat different. This is however not new, a famous physicist Schrödinger who was a pivotal founder of quantum mechanics once pointed out that life may be a result of the thermodynamics of a system with an external energy source as opposed to just chance. Life is an inherent physical aspect of our universe and nothing special. As such life is bound by the laws of physics and thermodynamics.  If we take this further then that life is bound by thermodynamics is quite interesting as it means life may be modeled statistically in a way analogous to the way we model the statistics of gasses. Thus when you look at a group of people you notice their values and actions tend to form certain statistical patterns that are shaped by the enclosing(environmental) forces. For those not familiar with the statistical modelling tools and the results and predictions in thermodynamics these systems may not seem so predictable.  In the case of the religious their values and actions are shaped by certain rejection of causality or rationality and replace it with an adherence to their religion and faith.  Reasoning and rationality tend to act as a conservative field which limits the state space of values or actions an individual is willing to make(like how gravity holds down the earths atmosphere). Because faith by definition reduces reasoning and rationality many states that seem irrational suddenly start to become rational or acceptable to the religious. It can create slippery slopes like what has occurred in the middle east, because as the community shifts to become more violent they are unable to rationally determine that becoming more violent is detrimental to their existence and the nearby more violent states are easily filled as the weak rationality means it does not take much energy to shift to those states. Thus over time the values of the community can shift very significantly from their original position. This gives rise to the no true Scotsman problem because its easy for one group to reason that the other is not true to their faith, when the real driver of values is not the original texts but that the lack of rationality driven by faith enables them to shift between values along a somewhat random walk. Thus you end up with problems like the Protestants and Catholics in Ireland where by they are essentially of the same faith and yet derive completely different values over time due to this random walk of states. They end up in states so far from each other that they cannot reason each others values and thus start a conflict.    Thus trying to determine if a value is neutral to a religion doesn't always make sense because it depends on the current state of that religion as opposed to the actual religious text. At different times and with different groups you will get completely different answers and they will all be sure that is how their faith should be because that is the state which they are in. A non religious person will of course derive a completely different answer but at the same time that does not mean we are immune from unconsciously accepting certain values without questioning their implications. While we may consciously encourage rationality our mental capability is still limited and thus as imperfect beings we also have a tendency to weakly reason and move to detrimental states. One only hopes that our conscious effort to encourage rationality minimizes these problems.  In the case of religious extremism faith is absolute and tends to act like a brain dividing by zero on rationality thus they will be willing to jump to any state that supports their religion even if the substantiation is completely irrational. For those who are less religious, their faith is not extreme and thus has some uncertainty. That uncertainty may be small but it means rationality is divided by a small number and thus can still conclude reasonable numbers. We all need some uncertainty in what we think we know to maintain rationality because uncertainty is an important aspect of reality.  Sorry long winded answer. Thus if you ask a religious person weather a given custom or value is wrong, it will likely be determined by their level of faith(uncertainty) and weather they consider that value or custom to be supportive of their faith as expressed by their values in their current state.  Remember the ideology of faith tends to puts it above all else by definition and only uncertainty will limit that."

The Hindu version has deities at the left corner of the pit, while the Muslims has white marking at the same spot but no deities and such because its prohibited by Islam. The customs the same just different rules and style to adapt to Islam. There is nothing wrong with it and the marking on that corner is just a marking to be in line with the standard Kalaripayattu pit protocols which has been there for centuries..

I find it ironic myself when the Malay language is said to be ""evolving"" instead of ""devolving"" by some of the posters here, but not practicing antiquated wedding rites that aren't even neccessary is being picked out more.   People do many things that aren't necessary, antiquated or not. Why should Malay cultural practices be discarded in favour of Islamic ones simply because they are seen as antiquated and unnecessary? What makes them antiquated and unnecessary, and why do those factors mean they should be discarded? One can just as easily argue that the belief in a god that grants entry to a promised land, via judgment of arbitrary deeds, is equally old-fashioned, and largely unnecessary in these times."

Malays do have Silat as a Martial art, and for those who practice it at a deeper level (basically, the spiritual aspects of the martial arts itself, passed down for generations) would know that there's plenty of arabic verses that are almost like short prayers. There is no need to change that part of our culture because it doesn't exactly clash, or affect the practice of Islam in any way. If anything, it promotes it.

The importance of Islam in the political life of many countries where it is the predominant religion is underscored by the large percentages in these countries saying that they think of themselves first as a Muslim, rather than as a citizen of their particular country.  Large majorities in Pakistan (79%), Morocco (70%) and Jordan (63%) say they self-identify first as Muslims, rather than as Pakistanis, Moroccans or Jordanians. Even in Turkey, with its more secular traditions, a 43% plurality among Muslims identify primarily with their religion rather than their nationality. Indonesians are closely split with 39% self-identifying as Muslims first, 35% as Indonesians and 26% saying both equally. In Lebanon, however, just 30% of Muslims (this question was not asked of Christians) say they view themselves primarily in terms of their faith, rather than as Lebanese.   http://www.pewglobal.org/2005/07/14/iii-how-muslims-see-themselves-and-islams-role/"

In any case, I'm just pointing out how easy it is to find studies like these through some googling.   Religion is central to the identity of European Muslims. With the exception of Muslims in France, they tend to identify themselves primarily as Muslim rather than as British, Spanish, or German. In France, Muslims are split almost evenly on this question. The level of Muslim identification in Britain, Spain, and Germany is similar to that in Pakistan, Nigeria, and Jordan, and even higher than levels in Egypt, Turkey, and Indonesia. By contrast the general populations in Western Europe are far more secular in outlook. Roughly six-in-ten in Spain, Germany, and Britain identify primarily with their country rather than their religion, as do more than eight-in-ten in France.   http://www.pewglobal.org/2006/07/06/muslims-in-europe-economic-worries-top-concerns-about-religious-and-cultural-identity/"

singapore,3d30wp,kosherjellyfish,16,Mon Jul 13 15:34:25 2015 UTC,I used my free time to build a website that works like Reddit where users submit the latest deals or happenings in Singapore and we can choose to upvote the links we like.  I made this website as I always see my friends jioing their friends on Facebook to this and that. So I hope all those links can be categorized into a list in one website so we no longer have to find the links we seen and missed.
singapore,3d30wp,kosherjellyfish,11,Mon Jul 13 03:06:50 2015 UTC,"A suggestion: build up your community via a Facebook Page, or a group. Loads of the lobangs I see are via Facebook groups these days."
singapore,3d30wp,alphygian,3,Mon Jul 13 03:35:37 2015 UTC,Yup! I've created a Facebook page alongside with this website. Will be posting these links on Facebook too as well as allowing people on Facebook who liked the page to tag Get Jio on deals they shared.   The Facebook page is https://facebook.com/Getjio

singapore,3d30wp,omfgitsasalmon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:22:15 2015 UTC,"Not a problem :) Personal observation (for myself lah)  1) I only visit a few sites a day. Mainly Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Company Website and Instagram because anything that's meant to be known are already on those channels. I used Google Reader to read blogs too until they shut it down. I'm sure there are still people using RSS Readers, but not for myself anymore.  People wouldn't want to add another site to their daily visits, because people are already busy enough. Your site has good intentions, but it may get buried by loads of similar sites.   Build up your community: perhaps prepare some darn attractive giveaway prize when they LIKE your facebook page? And yeah... when there's a community, it's time to monetize the thing!"

For Facebook, I'm going to find ways to allow people to the Facebook page onto their shared post. What I will do is manually post these tagged posts on the page as well as the website.   For monetizing, I'm focusing on expanding user base first. Monetizing will come into consideration at a much further date."

singapore,3d4hde,cheesesauceboss,25,Mon Jul 13 13:24:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely sounds like you got a case for fraudulent misrepresentation. Threaten him, give him a couple of sleepless night, then go to CEA; we can do with fewer slimy salespersons in Singapore.   300 for cleaning and 300 for a light    Before asking for that specific amount, they have to at least produce the quotation from the contractors they intend to hire. Which you either have the option to remedy it for cheaper, or accepting their request.  Secondly, if you have solid evidence that such was not the condition that you handed over in, you definitely have this case in the bag.   singapore law demands i also pay him one month rent as a fee   No. This is not the law, it's just common practice. If you have written evidence (e.g. SMS, email, etc.) that he did say something like that to you then BOOM 1-2 punch! That siao eh can kiss this career goodbye."
singapore,3d4hde,GunkyEnigma,3,Mon Jul 13 14:31:48 2015 UTC,"Not entirely sure what the circumstances are, but to add on to this,  assuming that you are the tenant and the agent acts for the landlord, the agent is prohibited from collecting any fee from you. See this document from the Council of Estate Agents: http://www.cea.gov.sg/cea/content/binary/pdfFiles/No%20dual%20representation.pdf   Extract from that PDF:   ""If a salesperson collects a fee from the tenant/buyer and also collects part of the fee from the landlord/seller, it will be a case of dual representation and is an offence under the Estate Agents Act."""

singapore,3d4hde,VPee,2,Mon Jul 13 14:16:57 2015 UTC,"Instead of threatening him to go to CEA, draft a formal complaint to CEA explaining the facts. Make copies of all texts (sms), verbal conversations, emails etc that you have exchanged. Next send a copy of this to the agent and inform him that it is okay if he doesn't return the whole deposit as the stakes are now higher as you will also claim for damages and harassment. This is enough to have him scampering to save his career. I once met a very rude agent who would keep advertising a property and never show. She sent me an sms once about owner not being comfortable with a few races. And when I confronted her she told me she would go to my company HR to complain against me etc. Heard it all. Then told her that I had made a copy of her sms's and was going to CEA with complaint of racism, coercion and harassment. I had 16 apology messages after that. Play it smart. In fact incite him to send you some sort of an sms that you can use as a basis for a complaint. It doesn't necessarily have to be anything to do with the deposit. Could be about your race etc."
singapore,3d4hde,UnparagonedWisdom,2,Mon Jul 13 23:35:49 2015 UTC,"Can I asked if You have received your deposit? If You did, then I can tell You it's all good. Don't pump any money back.  Reason being: during the handover, if he wasn't happy with the conditions, he would have voiced out. So I have to ask if You received your deposit back. And I'm guessing you're not local."
singapore,3d4hde,km55,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:29:49 2015 UTC,"in my opinion, your options are:   to call him out on it. say you will replace the lightbulb and settle the cleaning yourself. If they do not accept, it means they were intending to deduct those 2 amounts anyway. yes, feel free to report to CEA, but they can do very little, from my experience. it will cost you $50-$100 to go a very basic letter of demand through a neighborhood lawyer. Serve the landlord and the agent to show you mean business (but make sure you have evidence and a clear case, otherwise your legal fees with ratchet up) anything more than a basic letter of demand would not be worth your while, since it will eventually come to more than $600.  your final option is to tell the owner to deduct $100 (or whatever amount you deem fit based on the condition you left the place in) for ""changing of a lightbulb"" and apartment cleaning. tell him the remaining deposit must be returned by XYZ date, 12noon, failing which, he is illegally withholding your deposit (make sure your agreement doesnt allow him to hold it for up to 2 weeks, because thats what im able to do with my problematic tenants) and you will reserve all your legal rights and any delay will result in him also having to bear the cost of your legal action, if any.   personally, i would refrain from following /Vpee/ 's suggestion because you simply want to get your deposit back. be above board and dont try to incite someone just to be able to point a finger and blame them for something you incited.   i really dont think $600 is fair for cleaning and changing of lightbulbs, since my management's handyman will literally clean the entire place, touch up minor damages where possible and change a few lightbulbs for $100-$150.  good luck!"
singapore,3d4hde,km55,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:11:08 2015 UTC,Thank you for detailed reply. The thing is the handover is complete. My agent knew this guy is slime so he had him sign a written note that everything is satisfactory. With this letter what course can i take.
singapore,3d4hde,rod_of_war,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:54:09 2015 UTC,"If you have it in writing that the handover was done satisfactorily (and kudos to your agent for being thorough), then legally, your landlord has zero right to hold your deposit.   Send an email to your landlord with a scanned copy of the written note saying everything was handed over satisfactorily and ask them to explain the basis of their action.   Finish the letter by saying based on the signed hand over letter, that you will give them XYZ amount of time to refund the deposit, failing which, you will have no choice but to refer the matter to a lawyer. Emphasize the fact that the written note is binding, since after handover, it could have been anyone who dirtied the place and the fact that the slimy agent took it over without much fuss says a lot about the standard it was handed over in.  Just a piece of advice - give about 5-7 days for them to ""process"" the deposit. If you ask for an unreasonable amount of time (ie 12 hours) to refund the deposit, and if you really have to go through litigation (which i hope not, it wont be worth it), it will reflect poorly on you. This is just the way things are.  tldr; you are in a good position based on what you have told me. ask for your deposit back courteously to show you want to resolve the matter without involving legal action unless your hand is forced."

singapore,3d8tr4,aktsukikeeper,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:49:56 2015 UTC,"Corruption happens due to a couple of factors.  1) Punishment: The harsh punishment for the crime is severe.   2) Stigma: The social stigma from taking a bribe means you are likely to be shunned for the rest of your life.  3) Financial well-being: You are more inclined to take a bribe if you're not doing so well in life.   Singapore is fortunately because we do well in all these factors. Most Singaporeans are well taken care of and therefore not inclined to take the risk of corruption.

singapore,3d7d1g,mydevilsride,3,Tue Jul 14 02:22:37 2015 UTC,Stick to the one year warranty and then once it's almost over buy yourself a 3 -year apple care. Most people will do that because its a cheaper option.  Apple store you can upgrade your specs  Licensed resellers you get freebies and pay installment   Refurbish is cheaper but not a wide range of laptops will be available and mostly previous gen too
singapore,3d7d1g,mortichro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:35:43 2015 UTC,"You can pay using instalment with the online Apple Store too, you just have to call them to set up the instalment.  Also, the edu store offers discount ranging from $140 to $200+. AppleCare will also be cheaper on the edu store. Most of the time the ""freebies"" resellers bundle together with new laptops are rubbish anyway, so if you can do without those, just go for a refurbished model or get one from the edu store. You'll also get free shipping to your doorstep."
singapore,3d7d1g,MachDiamonds,2,Tue Jul 14 02:58:01 2015 UTC,The apple store instalments only accept Citi-bank. Resellers accept various cards but you need to check.

Call to check the price as it's usually somewhat cheaper than the Apple store for some models, especially the higher end ones. (I think they get some stock from other Asian countries.) I've found the accessories to be the same price though.  For Apple Care, you can buy it any time within your 1 year warranty. It's cheaper to get it from Amazon if you can. I had no problems registering my MacBook with Apple Care from Amazon.  One difference is that retailers like NuBox often give you some freebies like mousepads, generic mouse, etc."

singapore,3d4e8k,ItsNotMyFirstRodeo,25,Mon Jul 13 12:52:53 2015 UTC,"BMT=basic military training, where you learn the very basics of being a soldier (how to fire a gun, how to touch trees, how to not march like a penguin). Depending on your PES status (how fit/injured you are), your BMT may vary from 1 week to 2619 weeks.  You will not get to book out during the first two weekends. After that, you can book out on public holidays and weekends except for that one week where you have field camp and SIT test. If you're wondering, field camp is not done in an open field, but in the jungle. Also, you don't sit much in the SIT test - it's a test of how you react during certain war-time SITuations.  You will have your first ever Passing Out Parade (POP), which is usually done after a 24km route march (72km if you're gonna wear a red beret).  After that, you will be assigned a vocation (something like a job). You can go to command school to be an officer (lieutenant) or be a specialist (sergeant), or you can be a man (private/corporal).  Either way, you will have to go through further training. E.g. if you're a signaller, you will spend a few months training with signal sets, if you're a armor infantry, you will spend months running behind tanks. Unless you're PES C, it's likely that you will be spending some time out in the field too.  After completing further training, you will have another POP, where you get your rank if you're in command school or your beret if you're a man.   You will then be assigned to unit, where you will serve in the vocation you are trained in, until the end of the 2 years, which is your Operationally Ready Date (ORD) - also the biggest milestone in NS.  Edit: Bolded the important events  Re-edit: Reduced weeks in Tekong for Pes B(P)"

singapore,3d4e8k,yongjunjie,2,Mon Jul 13 13:56:11 2015 UTC,How do they determine whether who goes to OCS and who doesn't?
singapore,3d4e8k,DarthDanial,2,Mon Jul 13 17:56:20 2015 UTC,"Factors such as education, overall performance in BMT and the sit test results. Mono-intake recruits(direct enlistees to units,therefore bypassing tekong) have their sit test omitted most of the time."
singapore,3d4e8k,mrdoriangrey,2,Mon Jul 13 18:00:49 2015 UTC,"A few factors: The first is the test you will take at CMPB during the medical check-up. It's kinda like an IQ/personality test, and it will determine where you will end up.  Your performance in Tekong matters too because your BMT commanders will have to recommend you to leadership positions.  If you do well in the IQ test but fail as a person in Tekong (give lots of trouble, etc), you probably won't go to command school.  Getting at least a silver in IPPT will also be a huuuuuuuge boost. You may still get in if you just pass your IPPT, but those cases are few and far in between."

singapore,3d4e8k,hexacoto,24,Mon Jul 13 13:08:07 2015 UTC,"Let me share my story (long story warning) but it might give you an insight to the intellectual stresses of NS for me:  I was given PES A/B status, don't remember which. JC kid, had a solid idea of what I wanted to in university and later on in life. As such, NS to me was holding me back 1 year 10 months from being on track to what I wanted to do with my life.  I excelled in BMT, was thought of very highly by the enciks and peers during SIT test (I was not pushy, I was always willing to help people and such), indicated ""No"" to both SISPEC and OCS to the dismay of my enciks and my parents. I eventually was vocated to reconnaissance (recce) as a man.  I was already very independent before NS so I had no problems doing my own laundry, folding clothes, sheets, etc. I did not ""become more independent"" or discover any life skills worth talking about. Some of my friends did, and learned those life skills. I didn't.  If anything, and I always tell people when they ask about my NS life, the only think I took away was that there was no lower point in my life than NS. Today, in my life, I can basically tahan any shit thrown my way because of how lowly I viewed my time in NS. Crappy living conditions? I've slept under a literal bush during outfield whilst raining with bugs crawling all over me. Maddening superiors at work? I've dealt with superiors with only primary school education asking me to apply shoe polish to the undersoles of my boots to elude Australia's quarantine laws, much to the disgust of the quarantine officers when they had to touch our belongings (you'll realise there are 2 universal solutions to everything in NS: electrical tape and Kiwi shoe polish). Bad weather? I've ridden a bike in a typhoon in Taiwan.  What was problematic was I did not take pointless orders very well, and there are a lot of those in NS. You just had to follow the orders, even if they were very inane. Even if you had a more efficient solution to a problem, suggesting it to your superior could either land you their gratitude or make you liable for insubordination (and some superiors like to threaten that a lot). One prime example was when I was in a team in Taiwan for training and we had to get to a rendezvous point, our platoon sergeant wanted to take a straight-line route. His route involved climbing over and into someone's backyard, and he was barked by the dog (and he barked back). My teammate and I simply walked around the house and met him up at the front when he finished crashing through the property.  A portion of superiors tend to be regulars who usually don't have a lot of formal schooling, but are usually quite street smart, and some don't take kindly to JC/poly upstarts who have eaten less rice than they have salt. Learning to deal with such people become a skill to develop I guess, maybe that's something useful I learnt.  NS will make you dumber intellectually. A year in and I realised I forgot how to use certain words that I would have no problem back in JC. The lack of practice of reading and writing just makes your grasp of vocabulary and discourse weaker. I made an effort to not only keep up with reading (and you'll have a lot of time to read in your down time), I kept up with writing essays, poetry, and my thoughts. Playing XBox/PSP/video games is a nice and easy distraction, but fulfilling yourself intellectually is just as important, because it'll make you seem less stupid when you do start university.  Many parts of the 1 year 10 months were spent learning how to deal with incredible boredom, especially on outfield. I had guard duties where I had to stand in a guard box of hours at a time and you're not even allowed a book or a phone. I learnt to stare at the graffiti on the walls of the box and made up stories in my head about the people doodling in the box.  I didn't make a lot of friends whilst in NS because I was the weird one who felt like NS was a waste of time and wanted to start college ASAP. My peers who didn't approach NS negatively probably viewed their time in there more favorably. Didn't help that I spoke funny and had a weird accent but people got over that soon enough. Sometimes I look through Facebook at the batch mates that I bothered to add as friends and wonder what their lives are like now, and whether they're still chummy with each other. Then again, I wonder about everything.  I've ORD'd and went to university overseas. People are constantly amazed that I ""did the military"" but I don't think the experience compares with what people in South Korea or Israel have to do, where there are actual confrontation possibilities. Ours is a bubble where people play their own games and anything gleaned within might not necessarily translate out of it.  Go in with neutral expectations. Going in pessimistic will make you miserable, and going in optimistic might make you disappointed."
singapore,3d4e8k,KaseyRyback,7,Mon Jul 13 20:42:10 2015 UTC,"the only think I took away was that there was no lower point in my life than NS.   I can't say for sure whether NS was my lowest point but it was definitely memorable for all the wrong reasons. To add on, it was all those ridiculous restrictions and rules on your freedom [which persists even after you ORD] and how they could just arbitrarily dole out punishments without what normal people would consider due process. All the regulations are set to the lowest lowest lowest common denominator.   The sad part is that the people with power (even NSFs) act like it's all normal [some would say of course they should] and treat NSFs like they signed up for it.   pointless orders    yes. It's interesting how NS is like a separate universe. Reason and rationality have no place in it [I get it - war and all].   NS will make you dumber intellectually. A year in and I realised I forgot how to use certain words that I would have no problem back in JC. The lack of practice of reading and writing just makes your grasp of vocabulary and discourse weaker.   so much fucken yes. The sad thing is people think they know this feeling, but when I ask them how their BMT or other training is like they told me their entire company (or at least platoon) was filled with JC or poly kids and I'm like 'lol'. [I don't want to reveal too much about my NS experience but suffice to say it's different from the usual]  I've nothing against people from other backgrounds (I take them as they come, good and bad one has to accept and learn from each other) but damn I'd be lying if I said I didn't sometimes wish my platoon/company were different.  Until this day I think I permanently lost a part of my JC-self due to NS.   you're not even allowed a book   What's funny was while that applied to me, I saw a regular doing it and well it's all about the rank.   weird one who felt like NS was a waste of time   so much yes. Although I did manage to find people like these there were too few of them; and also I actually didn't slack off during NS [something which I now find pointless, not least because I saw the extent of malingering people would go through with just to slack off but in the end nothing happened to them]"

Sure, the money is better but the added ""responsibilities"" were no more real than the war games NS makes you play. I did not begrudge being in a position unable to lead or effect changes, merely lamented at how inept my superiors are.  2) I'm not quite sure what you're talking about or trying to say. I took the time whilst in NS to prepare for college education. I read, wrote, and studied in my spare time. Certain academic skills inevitably become out of your reach no matter how much you study.  3) I did get to mix and hang out with people from all walks. I just did not necessarily click with them, nor were many on the same wavelength as I was.  Without that determination or conviction you spoke of, I would not have taken the time to take the SATs during NS and applied for university overseas.

This is a huge misconception. There are many important life lessons one can easily pick up as a ""leader"" that are relevant to many things later in life, be it personal, social, or professional. Learning these lessons early on in NS means a person have a better chance of having an early start."

I probably learned a lot more about human empathy and working with people at the ground level because we're all under the same umbrella stuck in the same shitstorm, but then again that is a continuous life lesson one learns even back in school, when doing school projects. This is going to be a bit of a horn toot, but even before NS I've already been comfortable in a leadership position; assigning work and roles to teammates, understanding how individuals come together to achieve larger goals, entrepreneurship, taking charge and stepping back when needed, etc.  I was that annoying gungho JC kid that did debates, aced presentations, raised hands often in class to ask questions. NS taught me to shut up and sit down, and not raise anything. But I learned that people of that ken existed and I learned how to work around them (or at least survive them)."

I made full use of it. if only you are able to visualise that all these are opportunity instead of roadblock. the most important things that i gotten was the PR, 3 of my NS mate are my closest friends and we basically go overseas every time together with families, we of course build our own company and there isnt any trust issue which is the greatest thing you can have for forming a biz."
singapore,3d4e8k,hexacoto,7,Tue Jul 14 10:00:14 2015 UTC,"I'm glad that NS worked out well for you, and that you found good mates who have become life-long friends for you.  While I was probably very fit physically due to NS, I was already leading an active lifestyle prior to NS, and even after NS I am still keeping up with physical activities. So I still consider myself at a level of fitness commensurable with fit people my age.  I did not make any lasting or close friendships during NS. That is down to being in a right group of people who aligned enough with your ideals to form those friendships. I was not in such a position. Despite being among JC/Poly peers in my intake, I had a very different outlook in life that just is not common among many other Singaporeans/people going through NS. This is neither their fault or mine, it's just circumstance. Even in JC I had only 1 or 2 close friends, that was it. I have found like-minded friends later on in life and I do not begrudge never having found close friends in NS.  My ""mentality"" was not honed upwards, but I've learned better to tahan bullshit. Would I have been better off never having been put through the grinder? I can't rightly say. Am I better off having learned how to tahan nonsense? I guess it never hurts. Would I have been better off having gone to university 2 years earlier and be able to enter the workforce earlier? Definitely. Especially with the rampant age-ism in Singapore, people do not realise 2 years make a big difference in job hunting and contributions to the economy (taxes, savings, etc. etc.).  I am already a Singapore citizen. I'm happy NS helped with your immigration status. I'm glad you've managed to eke out business opportunities with friends you've found in NS too, that's a rare opportunity to be cherished."

singapore,3d4e8k,wryyl,5,Mon Jul 13 13:37:49 2015 UTC,"So far I've seen a number of people here give overviews of the 2 years as well as a couple PES C people sharing they're experiences. I thought I might chip in with what a infantry unit is like. Normally such units are made up of the mono intake, though there's a chance to get posted here after you POP from BMT, or graduate from command school.   I came from 1SIR, consisting of 3 rifleman and 1 support companies, with each company being about a hundred strong. Don't let the term 'support' fool you though, they're still combat ready and have a wholly shitty life in this unit. Support companies consist of scouts and I forget what else.  You start off with a 6 week (?) basic infantry course. A series of PT, route marches, and a few outfields. Basically like BMT, but not quite as ez.   Life in 1SIR was split into 6 rotations (I think that's the term?). Basically evaluations where your company and unit gets a score according to the performance of the men. Different rotations evaluate different things.   Probably the first rotation would be to evaluate the men's technical handling (IBOS). Things like weapon stripping/assembling for SAR/M203/SAW, handling of the matador/LAW, night vision operation, first aid, field navigation, etc.   Then you have a few rotations whereby it's essentially missions and missions on top of one another. When you do field camp in BMT, you'll probably think to yourself, ""this fucking sucks"". Really though, BMT field camp is complete ezmode lol. Missions range from single night ones (move out in the evening, attack at dawn, return to camp by noon), to 3-4 day ones (attack, defend, quick-attack; not necessarily in that order). Missions can be conventional (jungle warfare), urban, or both.  For us we had a lot of missions at the Lim Chu Kang, Yishun, and Lor Asrama areas (just outside our camp, hooray). Urban missions often took place at MUTF, also near LCK.  Then there's Brunei, which was simultaneously pretty cool and really, really shitty at the same time. And Taiwan, which was just completely shitty all the time. I don't think I can adequately describe the experience in words, so I'm not even going to bother, heh.  We also went to Thailand and Hawaii as part of bi-lat exercises, though this isn't part of the normal 'curriculum'.  We were part of the National Day workforce with probably the best attachment of being ushers and managers for the civilian participants. Fun as fuck. Probably the most interesting part of NS for me.  After we finished the rotations (ATEC in Taiwan is the last), there was a few months where very little went on. During the last few months, our schedule was reduced to simply breakfast, lunch, dinner. Lots and lots of admin time, a nice break from the crap we went through.  ---  It's fucking shitty when you're going through it, but in hindsight... I wouldn't say the 2 years were worth it, but it wasn't not worth it, you know? Life gave you shit and now you know that you can take it."
singapore,3d4e8k,highdiver_2000,3,Tue Jul 14 03:00:04 2015 UTC,"Support roles in infantry goes to Poly or JC.  The idea is that easier to train and use.  eg GPMG, etc.  So you have a platoon infantrymen of quite possibly different educational background, eg Hokkien peng + you  The experience can be interesting for NS and reservist life.  One reservist was asking anyone to visit his nightclub.  Things might changed"
singapore,3d4e8k,mediumdeviation,4,Tue Jul 14 10:07:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm, a lot of PES C people in this thread. If you're PES C JC graduate, you might just end up like me - transport supervisor, which basically makes you a PES C 3rd sergeant. Not the best life by a long stretch, certainly not the worst.   For what it's worth, try very hard not to be a 3SG in transport. It's a thankless, horribly tiring job with very few benefits. You don't get the respect or pay of combat sergeants, and since you're limited by your PES you'll probably be doing below what you're intellectually qualified to do. Being a specialist you're stuck in what is basically army middle management, and in transport formation at least it's really not fun."
singapore,3d4e8k,veryfascinating,2,Mon Jul 13 16:20:17 2015 UTC,"Transport is the whorehouse of the army. Literally.   I recall during my time, a particular combatant high ranker came to draw a vehicle, but his name was not on the detail sheet. This was at 4.30am. He made a big fuss, activated a whole lot of our people including our bosses because his name wasn't on the list and we didn't have a vehicle prepared for him to drive away. He insisted that it was our fault and our oversight that was wasting his precious time and that we are the reason he is late for his meeting in another camp. Vulgarities were hurled at us, threats to charge us were thrown towards us for this matter. Finally after close to 2 hours we found out where the problem was - his clerk forgot to indent the vehicle for him. He then got into his own vehicle and drove off without apologizing or saying another word to us.   That's how transport is - combatants not happy/got problem, come here fcuk us in the rear then pat pat backside walk away. Their problem becomes our problem. Like i said, the whorehouse of the army. But even whores get paid more than us..."

A rule of thumb is you will get training for 6/9/12 months for men, specs and officers respectively. ~3 months BMT for all, and then 3/6 months additional training courses. After you finish all the courses, you enter your unit and usually there's another 3 month period to familiarize yourself with whatever your unit does.

singapore,3d4e8k,chavenz,3,Mon Jul 13 20:02:46 2015 UTC,"What's your PES status? if you get pes C or lower, your experience may differ from what most people write about.  I was pesC9L3. BMT in Tekong was only 3.5 weeks. During this period I had footdrills, light exercise, lectures, live firing, grenade throwing and outfield, but the outfield is only 2 days. Also, we don't run much. It's mostly stuff to increase general discipline, and to get you used to army life. If you've ever been in a uniform group, you won't have a problem.  Then we transferred to Sembawang Training Camp(STC) for vocational training. In my case, I was an Ammo Storeman, so even though I stayed in STC, we were taken to Rifle Range Road daily for lessons. The rest had their lessons in STC. At the end of our stay, we had a ceremony which was like a really small POP without the long march.  After that was complete, I was sent to Paya Lebar Ammo Depot, sent back to Rifle Range Road for more training, and then finally to Hendon Camp Ammo Magazine, which is like a really small facility that holds ammunition. Hendon Camp is the commando camp, and mostly we supply the ammunition for the commandos training exercises. My duties included keeping stock of ammunition, going to other depots to check their stocks (usually Tekong), packing ammunition according to the orders we receive, and being around 24hrs a day in case shit happens and ammunition or explosives need to be used (usually some construction site finding an old bomb). Most of my army life was spent here. During this time, I went from private to corporal. Very few of us ever go higher than that. Becoming SGT is nearly impossible unless you up pes.  Aside from our day to day work in camp, we spent most of our time playing monopoly and uno, watching tv, eating at the canteen (not to be confused with the cookhouse), and spotting local fauna (like hornbills, otters, snakes, and monitor lizards).   It's pretty boring. And I spent one or two weekends in camp every month.  I also spent a 2 weeks in Brunei to support a commando training exercise, but I volunteered for it, so most people in my position don't actually go overseas. Some Supply Assistants (storemen) are given the opportunity to go overseas for long periods of time. If you don't mind being away from friends and family for a long time, go. The pay is significantly better (~$1.7 for CPLs in brunei), you won't spend much since you're in camp most of the time, and you'll have a nice sum saved up once you go home."

singapore,3d4e8k,chuck6726,3,Mon Jul 13 18:00:36 2015 UTC,"Yet another thread about army... but I'm glad to help.  BMT is the first phase. Depending on whether you are in PTP or enhanced, the training starts differently. In PTP, you have like a month of physical training, very little in the form relating to military stuff. You also have more time to settle in with your bunkmates and make good friends. Days are usually spent running, swimming, or doing strength exercises. Your enhanced friends come in after that initial phase, but different companies. After that, you start learning how to operate a rifle, throw your grenade, go range, and yes... the dreaded field camp. Field camp in BMT... is just crazy man. And that's because you cannot do whatever you want to. It will be the first time you are pushed to physical and metal exhaustion. After that, SIT test, and POP LO.   What to take note in BMT, be a nice guy to everyone. Help to do mundane stuff like filling water bottles, arranging shoes, helping to take snacks etc. This would hopefully show you as a genuine guy, and not some wayang guy. Go win the hearts of your platoon mates, and when you step up to help your commanders, they won't feel you are wayang, and would support you.  Learning curve here 3/10. Because everyone is as noob as you.  I somehow made it to OCS. I wanted to avoid it, but at the same time, I wanted to go through BMT peacefully. So I just did everything I was told to do in BMT, and helped to do the mundane stuff because really, the faster you do, the faster you get to rest. I guess that's how I stood out. In OCS, it's a different story. No one is able to skive. It's at least 2 - 3 officers per section. They will know whether you are slacking or not. There are plenty of lectures to attend as well. Do not fall asleep. The outfields in OCS are even more fun. There's a element of letting you put what you learned into practise. It's really really tough. There are days where you want to crawl into a hole and die. Stick to it really. The greatest reward is not the money or fame. The greatest reward as an officer is that you get to gain some control of your life when you commission.   Learning curve in OCS - 8/10  So what do I mean by control? After you comms, you are an officer. You go to a unit. You don't really have to answer to anyone.. except higher ranked officers. You can do what you want, and go where you want. But, with great power comes responsibility. You have a ton of shit to do. Prepare for events, go for meetings, do a fuckload of office work, train with your men, and when shit blows up, you will get fucked if it was your area. If you cannot gain the respect of your men, you are fucked. My unit guys were all ah bengs with tatts, I was a poly kid who has never really been in a fight. I started out by just talking to them. Asking them questions like ""nice tatt, why you put? Where to get tatts ah? Intro leh"". Slowly I managed to make friends out of them and hell man, it's worth it. I was chosen as an instructor after a few months in unit, so.... I won't go into it because it's really too slack already.  Learning curve in unit - 10/10 get rekt  Closing words. Be a nice guy really. Don't complain. Don't victimize people. Take it as you have no other choice but to go in, so MAKE THE BEST OUT OF IT."

singapore,3d4jd0,khiladi-,3,Tue Jul 14 05:24:18 2015 UTC,"I have made an observation about forums (in general, not just in Singapore) a while ago that may be relevant to you.  Gone are the days of general-purpose, standalone forums because of:  1) Rise of social media. People can better select what they're interested in, and therefore only view what they want. Also, people naturally are indisposed to opposing ideas. Social media creates a kind of echo chamber where people need only be exposed to ideas they find agreeable to.  2) Size of internet with the prevalence of Google. The bigger the internet, the more knowledge is stored, and the easier it is to find with Google, and therefore the lesser general purpose forums are needed. Think about it: posts on forums and social media often include citations from Wikipedia. If knowledge management is the primary reason for the forum, then the internet+Google is already doing a great job.  For a few years now, the first question a person should ask before creating a website is: ""Can you do this on Facebook?"". If so, forget it. Therefore, for a forum to be successful, it should be part of a broader website, wrapped around the forum that provides additional information or services that are not general but specific (eg hardwarezone website vs its forum)."
singapore,3d4jd0,hannorx,4,Tue Jul 14 06:04:05 2015 UTC,I always introduce Reddit as a super forum.
singapore,3d4jd0,hannorx,2,Mon Jul 13 15:30:41 2015 UTC,"Forums that cater to a specific community interest such as photography are still alive e.g. Clubsnap. But forums like SGClub is pretty much inactive IMO. The primary reason I suspect is due to changing attitudes in establishing an online identity. Teenagers are now more likely to write shorter messages, and it's not surprising then that Twitter and Facebook groups appeal to them.  I agree with you that forums are great for knowledge repository. An example of this is Stackoverflow (and all the other subforums). I also believe that forums provide a better medium for expressing yourselves as compared to Twitter where you are limited by the number of characters. Knowledge management and retrieval is also much simpler in forums. Personally, I still do actively participate in forums (reddit, stackoverflow, google groups), but only if it falls in my interest.   Edit: If the forum you're building has an audience, I see no reason why you shouldn't run one."

As in, anything that is covered as i am in the car.   I am only here for a month more and I don't think that the distance between my home and work (about 5-7km) should cover more than a full tank of gas. Of course should it be more, I will not hesitate to put my share."

singapore,3d8hos,fellatemoi,23,Tue Jul 14 09:32:46 2015 UTC,"Not many 40 year olds here, but I'm one of them. I'm quite similar to your description, good boy type in my youth, married my first girlfriend for 15 wonderful years now. Never went clubbing, drinking, etc.   Married life is not easy and takes effort. Romantic love evolves to a form of caring love. You have to accept that your wife is not going to behave the same way as when you were young and dating.   About 12 years ago I had my one and only temptation at work. Had a pretty young thing who worked closely with me, often late into the night. We flirted with each other  but only verbally. I had a big crush on her. As tempted as I was to go further, I wouldn't cheat on my wife. Somehow I knew that I would regret it for the rest of my life. Eventually the girl was posted to another department and had an affair with another married man there. Ended in tears too when that guy dumped her after the one night stand. Everyone in the office knew about it. Bullet dodged.   I haven't been tempted since. I even feel guilty for being tempted, imagine how guilty I would feel if I had taken action."

I think you should go ahead and enjoy yourself... not to much but perhaps find a willing friend and get tested for stds and use birth control if your partner is female. Have an agreement with your wife. Dont do something behind her back. That will probably ruin your relationship a lot. Just be honest and safe.

I'm the last one to talk about morality here. Still, you gotta understand, you have a partner who is most likely going to lose her trust in you when she finds out. IF you are ready to face the fallout, then satisfy your urges by all means.  Trust me when I say this, I've seen a LOT of friends, colleagues and acquaintances get caught breaching their spouse's trust. NONE of them have ended well. It's messy, it's painful, and it eats at BOTH of you, even if you think you can handle it.

Edit: To think of it Singapore is kinda boring and usually money is a main concern. What do we youths do anyways? Hang around at town, window shop, watch movies, eat. Alcohol is expensive. A night out at a bar is expensive. Clubbing is expensive. Go to the beach or a cafe? Lol. That depends on your clique.   The more photogenic people I know spend time visiting places recommended by local sites espeically thesmartlocal.com, mainly as a photoshoot outing to add that one more pic to their insta.   The more hip people pick up dancing and chill out at the Scape, Somerset district.  Just throwing out stereotypes I know. Mainly based on Instagram browsing. Take everything with a pinch of salt."

I second that recommendation to check out Chinatown or the bazaar at Geylang. It's the kind of local flair that sometimes even locals miss out on and don't see all the time.   I also second boardgames, especially the more social ones like The Resistance or Cash &amp; Guns. I love me some video games but board games are more interactive and easier to pick up sometimes. Man I miss playing boardgames; my boxes are sitting untouched.   I'm beyond the age range but somewhat bored too; can't really relate to my peers since they have all moved on to other things that I can't quite relate to.

They seek ""dignity"" through labor after retirement - ya, getting shouted at in mcdonalds and collecting cans is very dignified. This is the kind of self reliance that the govt loves I suppose.

singapore,3d5cmh,heyitsmeandrew,6,Mon Jul 13 17:28:05 2015 UTC,I've always wondered how these bomb shelters work. So what..? When we are bombed the whole building collapses except a few thin columns of shelters protruding from the ground?   I suppose trying to get out of them at the upper floors will still end up getting you killed...  ...by gravity.
singapore,3d5cmh,andrewhahalee,3,Tue Jul 14 02:00:20 2015 UTC,"Someone was telling me before that the theory behind them is that in the event of an attack by neighbouring countries, they're likely to use artillery attacks to try to terrorize the population. Artillery is more likely to pepper the buildings than outright demolish them, so bomb shelters are useful for protecting people in that scenario. You're right that they're completely useless against aerial bombing which would flatten buildings."
singapore,3d5cmh,irlando,2,Tue Jul 14 02:36:55 2015 UTC,"What the other guy said.   It's surprisingly difficult to knock down current buildings with artillery or bombing, but you can certainly blow up sections of the building. Just look at the damage to buildings during the Chechyna War, Gaza, or any urban conflict. The bomb shelter offers extra protection from shrapnel and other attacks, rather than keeping you safe from all attacks. Adds survivability rather than grants it."

An attempt to silence ST with a defamation suit was hastily dropped once ST started dredging up more evidence. In 2009 the AWARE takeover attempt was crushed with another ST siege, which eventually culminated in the Straits Times Chief Editor Han Fook Kwang publicly demanding that Sin Boon Ann, a then-PAP Member for Tampines GRC, substantiate his allegation in Parliament that SPH coverage was biased. To my knowledge, Sin declined to do so. It's hard to tell who won that one - Sin retired in 2011 and Han in 2012 - but SPH does not seem inclined to pull its punches.   in the post-Cold-War environment media attitudes are heavily shaped by the FEER affair; if you are foreign-based media, expect a low tolerance for scandal coverage."

singapore,3d2oug,Kosmicheskaya,9,Mon Jul 13 14:04:35 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify - there isn't a specific 'field' called investigative journalism.   Each journalist will be assigned a 'beat' under each department (e.g. local news: environment/education/health/housing). The journalist will have in-depth knowledge and contacts in the field, and will be relied upon to deliver news.   Anyway, the real reason is that we are discouraged from 'investigative journalism' by higher-ups. This is true especially for the local papers.   The reason given is that sources usually cannot be identified for the sake of security. This means less credibility and a little more sensationalism.  Also, it's really time-consuming. Not many departments can afford to be a man short for weeks.   The main reason is that there isn't much going on in Singapore. Any financial irregularities will usually be flagged up by audits (see Ren Ci hospital scandal), any politician messing up won't be spared by their own parties (see Michael Palmer/Yaw Shin Leong).  The papers are also more than willing to investigate a lead when given the evidence. The NKF scandal came about when a Straits Times journalist saw Durai's amazingly expensive toilet.  Edit: Source - am (kind of a) journo, have journo friends."

The latest FIFA arrests, for example, is the culmination of several investigative reports.  For an example closer to home, you may remember the NKF scandal back in 2005? That was also the result of investigative reporting, so yes it does exist in Singapore. The main impediment is our culture, which generally steers us away from questioning authority.  There is nothing in the law to stop you from investigative reporting as long as you remember to always back up your claims with extremely solid evidence. To use a current headline issue as an example, if you want to claim that Lee Hsien Loong criminally misappropriated CPF funds, make sure you have irrefutable evidence in black and white that backs you up. Otherwise, you'll just end up being sued, and frankly it'll be your fault for being an idiot.   To do this, you have to start as a junior reporter first, then spend a long time on your beat or area of interest to deeply understand the industry/field, and then start to pry away layers to look for the questions are most people are not asking, and keep your eyes and ears open for anything fishy.

Monkeys over around MacRitchie Reservoir are kinda cute and really interesting to look at. Other that the part where they try not-so-sneakily to steal your food or whatever that you're holding but seeing them being playful is rather fascinating.
singapore,3d4fzl,chuck6726,3,Tue Jul 14 15:45:52 2015 UTC,"Not sure if OP meant endemic or native species, because there aren't that many species known exclusively from Singapore (which is what 'endemic' usually means, biologically speaking).  If we're talking about endemic species, my personal favourites are our 3 endemic freshwater crabs:   Singapore Freshwater Crab (Johora singaporensis) - Found only in forest streams in hilly terrain in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Bukit Batok and Bukit Gombak; Johnson's Freshwater Crab (Irmengardia johnsonii) - Found only in forest streams in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment Nature Reserves; Swamp Freshwater Crab (Parathelphusa reticulata) - Found only in Nee Soon Swamp Forest  I know it shouldn't be surprising that an island would have its own unique species (look at the Galapagos, Madagascar, and Hawaii, for example), but considering that we're not some remote oceanic island, how close we are to Johor, and the fact that Singapore was most likely connected to much of the rest of Southeast Asia during the Pleistocene, it's amazing that some species in Singapore have actually managed to diverge to the point that we classify them as distinct species from their Johor counterparts.  (Of course, that's provided these supposed endemics aren't lurking somewhere in Johor's forests as well)"

singapore,3d42vl,jonandlind,7,Mon Jul 13 10:37:54 2015 UTC,"You chose the pug life, eh?  I'm subbed to a bunch of dog welfare and adoption agencies, and it's quite rare that I've seen a pug up for adoption. You can try subbing to them in any case, and perhaps giving them a visit eventually! Search for SOSD (Save Our Singapore Dogs) and ASD (Action For Singapore Dogs) on Facebook~  And yeah, the general consensus is that most vendors at Pasir Ris Farmway get their puppies from puppy mills. Hell, I suspect some proper looking pet shops in other parts of SG also get their 'stock' from there. I think the safest route to purchasing a dog would be to go through the Singapore Kennel Club, whether you find a pug breeder thru the list they provide, or asking pet shop owners if their (local/imported) puppies are registered with them.  As for vets and pet supplies, that's usually up to what's closest to your house! :)"

singapore,3d42vl,tjhan,2,Mon Jul 13 15:18:43 2015 UTC,Pugs are really problematic dogs health-wise and a lot of the ones here are smuggled from Malaysia drugged and hidden in car boots.  My boss has a pug which she adopted since it was from a confiscated smuggling case and had bad bad skin problems. Not an easy pet to have.
singapore,3d42vl,ritx,3,Mon Jul 13 15:39:33 2015 UTC,"I'm going to second this. My friend has two pugs, rescue, and she spends a lot of time taking care of them. Off the top of my head, they shed a lot, so the house needs to be cleaned often. Their face structure makes it easy for them to have breathing problems or something while they sleep. And she has to clean the folds of their face daily else the dirt starts to accumulate and they start to smell.  Have you considered what will happen to the dog if you guys separate? I may sound callous, but getting a pet is like having a child. You really need to think ahead for the pet's wellbeing if anything happens to your relationship."

singapore,3d21n9,mwolfee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:45:21 2015 UTC,"There's figure 8 too :D IIRC there were two lessons that had fig8, one near the start at low speeds without a time limit, and one more (well, more like a S curve) with a limit. Could do both, but never get the crank. Urgh."

singapore,3d21n9,jkohlc,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:35:26 2015 UTC,Bike course is around 1000-1400 depending how fast you can clear (i.e. no repeating lessons/tests).  Second hand can range from 1000 to 4000 for a bike with 3-4 years of COE left (basing on Honda Phantom TA200).  You can check out SBF (Singapore Bike Forum) for bike prices and lesson tips.

Amiami is the second line of shops that I'd consider because preorders and stock clearing usually give a good discount, unless you're getting it for the GSC bonus, that is.  After a while you'll realize the shops (and carouhell sellers) in SG are wayyyy overpriced once you've enough homework. I've sold some of those goods at base price so everyone else could enjoy it without having to pay ridiculous prices, though chances of it occurring often are kinda... rare."

Which is needed when you climb!)  If you just want to do bouldering or just climbing, then there's no need for that (there're techniques, but I don't do that as well...not yet anyway) Your partner can tie the knot for you, but then that also means your partner won't be able to climb since you won't belay him/her.  I recall you just need to register some indemnity form if it were your first time, but that's about it. Just bring socks and work out clothes. Shoes, harnesses, carabiner and ATC you can rent there"

singapore,3d05h4,MMApple,4,Sun Jul 12 15:04:57 2015 UTC,"For those interested, I compared the grade profile 'a few years ago' (AY 2010-2011) with the recent one (AY 2015-2016).   I picked the relevant ones by assuming NTU has highest percentage of poly students; courses that most poly students go to and the 10th percentile.   NTU 10/11   Mechanical Engineering - 3.60   Electrical & Electronic Engineering - 3.57   Business - 3.64   Chemistry & Biological Chemistry - 3.39    NTU 15/16   Mechanical Engineering - 3.50 (down 0.1)   Electrical & Electronic Engineering - 3.44 (down 0.13)   Business - 3.79 (up 0.15)   Chemistry & Biological Chemistry - 3.57 (up 0.18)    Basic conclusion and explanation: It's easier for poly students to enter university in an engineering course. This is because most of the courses offered by SIT (started 09/10) are engineering related.  Other possible explanation: Engineering course grade inflation. I don't have numbers to back up this theory, though I got a lot of convincing reasons."
singapore,3d05h4,Wheat-gen-stein,6,Sun Jul 12 15:06:01 2015 UTC,"The real reason is that there is simply a shortage of local engineers. Less and less students are attracted to engineering. Having less demand means that it becomes less competitive to enter. The impression has always been that engineering is hard to learn(true), low pay (not very true) and the work is 'dirty' (not true at all)."
singapore,3d05h4,MMApple,2,Sun Jul 12 16:17:46 2015 UTC,"IMO, I see the shortage of local engineers as an effect, not a cause for easier engineering course entry.  Do you think a BCC/C 'A' level student would choose engineering if he got a better score and have more options? A significant number of 'A' level students have no clue of their career ambition. Even among the better students, they just want to do a general degree (engineers is seen to have an 'analytical mindset' useful for multiple industries) and do something else later.  This theory applies to 'O' level students as well. Engineering is relatively easy to get into as well.  Honestly, I don't think people truly believe that engineers are low paid jobs. At worst they think it's hard work and so-so pay as compared to other established industry jobs (uh-hum finance, chem engineering)where the linear relationship is hard work and good pay. It's not a chicken and egg problem. It's a cultural problem of Singaporeans not adapting and taking risks."
singapore,3d05h4,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz,2,Sun Jul 12 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/gradeprofile/sprogramme-igp.html  Every engineering course in NUS has a grade profile better than BCC/C even at the 10th percentile level, and all of them are straight As at the 90th percentile level.   So yes, people do still choose engineering when they have better score and more options.   And how are chem engineers not engineers?"
singapore,3d05h4,MMApple,2,Sun Jul 12 19:13:49 2015 UTC,"Chem engineers ARE engineers! We just dont lack of them as much as electrical and mechanical engineers. Sorry if I give the impression of exclusion.  I believe that people who choose to do engineering in NUS do so by choice. NUS is seen as more prestigious and selective. As for the 90th percentile, I'm not too worried about the next Larry Page or Sergey Brin. There aren't many of them to say engineering is desirable or undesirable. NUS can afford to be a lot more selective since their slots can be less than half of NTU.  NUS 10/11 Mechanical Engineering - BBB/C (3.79) Electrical Engineering - BBB/C (3.67)  NUS 15/16 Mechanical Engineering - BBB/B (3.89) Electrical Engineering - BCC/B (3.74)"

More importantly, if we're still talking about universities it's inevitable the focus will be on the academic; so even where universities come up with alternatives to the standard national examination they're probably still very academic in nature [e.g. LSAT, GMAT, MCAT. I heard some UK unis just basically came up with a harder A-level system]. i.e. University is not trade school.  Then comes down to efficiency, is one going to set a test for every specific discipline?   In any case, where polytechnic courses are similar (or precursors) to the uni courses I don't think there's great difficulty for them to enter anyway [e.g. engineering]."

The GMAT is like a ridiculously harder version of the SAT I. (I reckon anyone who scored A1~B3 for O Level A Math can tackle the math section of the GMAT easily.)  From my understanding of the LNAT, it tests reading logic, which can be trained by doing exercises over and over (almost like playing sudoku).  Both don't test content knowledge and can be tackled easily by very smart people from any discipline.   The MCAT seems harder since it requires physics/chemistry/organic chemistry/biology knowledge, probably of A Level standard.  Honestly, I'm not sure what these tests actually test for. Maybe it's learning aptitude, logical thinking and grit? I guess they'll be useful in providing a standardised way to filter out the less academically-competent (or lazy and not-so-smart) poly students."

singapore,3d05h4,stridered,-2,Sun Jul 12 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"If they don't study in JC, how are they going to take the entrance exam for uni? The point of A level is to give them an academic education. That does not mean they are 'better' or 'worse off' than poly students, vice versa."
singapore,3d05h4,why_do_anything,6,Sun Jul 12 16:24:41 2015 UTC,"basically they can just have poly, since JC makes no different because everyone would have to take entrance exam anyway. Furthermore depending on how the entrance exam is set, it would definitely be biased against either one of the stream.  If the entrance exam is made up of mathematics and theoretical subjects (normally year 1 modules), JC students would win hands down. Otherwise if the exam is based on contextualized application based knowledge(year 2-4 modules), poly students would get the advantage.  So having an additional exam makes no sense seriously."
singapore,3d05h4,swifterrr,3,Sun Jul 12 16:36:11 2015 UTC,"There is no quota. There is no proof that there is. The universities are autonomous, the only thing they have in mind when admitting students is to take in the best. Why? Because simply, better students do well and that pushes up university rankings as a whole. Also, taking in weaker students is a stupid move because they have a higher chance of dropping out, wasting precious resources. So they would want the best, regardless of where the applicant is from.  The universities would take in a poly student if he is good, period. There is no preference for JC students, nor should there be. What logical reason would a university have for preferring JC students over poly students? You also have to consider that most of the top O-level students are choosing to go the the JCs instead of polytechnics. So you would naturally observe that more JC students would gain admissions into university."
singapore,3d05h4,Wheat-gen-stein,4,Sun Jul 12 16:58:37 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the fact that Poly trains students to be work ready be one of the reasons why the Uni's are less obliged to take them.  Cause if someone screws up their A's, jobs available to them are very limited due to their lack of skill and knowledge of different industries. Comparing that to Poly students who atleast have learned some sort of specialized skill, the poly students seem better off.   So it seems like a must for JC students to go through uni to at least learn a certain trade. Therefore uni should have more slots for JC as compared to Poly, since they don't have any skills to get a ""good/rewarding"" career."
singapore,3d05h4,swifterrr,3,Sun Jul 12 16:34:15 2015 UTC,"Sure, if the universities were purely under govt control, I wouldnt be surprised if they did something like that on the orders of the administration. As a country, it would be a very pragmatic move.  But the universities are not under the govt's control. They are independent. They dont care what happens to an A-level grad if he doesn't make it to university. The university looks out for the interest of its own students. Why must they consider weaker A-level students who did not gain admission? What's it to them if they have a limited job scope? They are not of the university's concern at all.  Yes, poly students are better off than A-level students if they both do not go to university. However, that still would not compel universities to pity the A-level student and take him in instead."
singapore,3d05h4,pkismeyea,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"So you would reward jc students who fucked up their a levels by letting them into uni? Why would the unis do this? If they fuck up their a levels, they always have the option of going to poly if they can't make it into uni."

Had this one teacher in primary school, here signature phrase was ""bloody shit!"", which to a 9 year old was shocking and funny as hell. She was great though old and wise.  Another was my form teacher in P5. Was my maths teacher too. Would regualrly bust me reading books in class. Instead of shouting or punishing me she just tell me kindly tell me to pit it down. After a few times of this, she told me to stay back and talk to her. I thought I was in deep trouble. But no, she actually telling me how impressed she was that I was reading the types of books I was reading. And told me how I should read more and more widely.  And I had this bio teacher. Hands down besy teacher I have had. Many students from her class will tell you the same. We all loved her because she got us. She knew that we were all individual human beings. She was extremely fair. Never saw us as ""Express"", Na or Nt. To her we were all equals. She was so gentle in her approach and you would know if she had ever spoken to you that she truly cared.  And then I had a form/maths teacher in JC. She was that cool one. Young, attractive and popular. Which confused me as to why she was so nice to me. Maths was one of my weaker subjects and I would take multiple explanations to get certain stuff. She would patiently guide me through hours of consultations.  Once I was in a rut and developed a bit of an attitude. So I just did not do her work one day. She sent me out of class. After the class she was the last to leave and caught me just as I leaving.  She aksked me if I was okay. I nodded.  ""You know how painful it is for me to see my Maths rep standing out there in the rain snowcroc.""  Snapped me the fuck back to reality. She truly cared.   I saw her cry once (NOT my fault) and it was one of the times I felt truly sad.  I was not special, she probably was nice to every student but she surely made you feel like you were.  ...  Also had a bit of crush on her. Almost all the boys did."

I transferred into school late (had to appeal in) and ended up having no friends in class, that coupled with me being a socially anxious 13-year-old obviously meant I was an easy target for her. I was bullied by her the entire year, she roped in my form teacher and forced my parents into a PTM because ""she has no friends"" (I would go to my sister's class during recess and talk to her friends instead). She constantly said my work and attitude was shit -- only because she fucking terrified me and I was a poorly adjusting Sec 1 nerdy girl in a school where everyone already knew each other from primary school. I don't deny that I was weak-willed and a complete wreck, but one day she called me out after class and fucking destroyed me by laughing about how it was ""no wonder [I] couldn't get into a better school"" because I had a bad attitude (???? bitch I did fucking well in every other class). I just remember hiding in the toilet after that and fucking crying for hours. Sec 1 was probably the worst year of my life because I had to deal with her bullshit and ostracism from my class because everyone who wasn't a target of hers idolized her; she was the kind of teacher that favoured the sociable sweet-talkers.  Anyway though my secondary school life got marginally better after that because I managed to make friends I channeled all my rage and feelings of injustice into studying for O Levels.

She told my friend about it and my friend took it that I hated her, thus our friendship was completely ruined.  Another time, it was the end of the school day and that same teacher asked me if my bag was heavy. I replied cheerfully, ""Nope! It's not heavy at all!."" And guess what she said? ""It's easy because you're a turtle. TURTLE."" What the shit I never even did anything wrong to her in my life and she constantly bullies me with hurtful remarks.  Just to add, she also made fun of the obese kids as well. It was a good thing though, that most everyone hated her   and our parents knew about it too. Sadly it took a few years before she was dismissed from the school, for reasons that were quite unrelated to her bullying.  The worst part of this story is that the classmates who weren't bullied by her, threw a reunion party years later and invited her. They must have had been pretty oblivious.  Oh and there was this math teacher who was extremely fierce and would resort to punishment if we didn't understand what she was teaching. I was so scared I tried to stay away from school."

Remembering that teacher just makes me smile as he such an inspiration.  Mr Kamal, you really are a wonderful teacher and a person.  I'm from NA. During the Sec 3 and 4 period, my class was filled with ah bengs and lians who were really disinterested in studying and the subject that we loathe the most was history and social studies. You could see that the entire class was asleep and nobody liked the teacher then. Once history lesson came me and another friend were probably the only ones awake listening to her talk. 80% of the class failed history and social studies. Nobody gave a fuck. My principal stepped in and decided to assign a newly posted in teacher.  The first day he came in, he didn't teach right off. He made sure we were all awake and instead of teaching, tried ice breaker games. He got to know each and everyone of us and made the lessons interesting. He would use analogies and funny examples to illustrate things in history which made remembering them easy. My class gradually started being interested in history and social studies. We then always looked forward to his lessons and even my class's ah bengs and lians even start to communicate with him. Gradually my class grades started improving. Although admittedly sometimes the bengs and lians would try to overstep boundaries but he would firmly set them in place. The teacher that was teaching us eventually got assigned to an express class and even they petitioned the school principal to allow him to teach them!   Despite being a teacher, He also liked to brag that he was really good at soul calibur on the xbox360. He suggested to bring his xbox360 at a school carnival and allowed us to buy tickets to play it and he would donate the proceeds to the school fund/charity. Of course, he brought soul calibur and we had a mini tournament. When it came down to it, it was me against him and the match was so tense as we both were left with a slither of health and I eventually won.. and he told me that it's been awhile since he played but we could always have a rematch at his house.   Unfortunately, I never got to say sorry to you Mr Kamal, for doing badly for my O levels. You always saw me obtaining the highest for social studies and history amongst the sec 4 and 5 NA cohort. But I had a bad mental block that day and didn't perform up to standard. I'm really sorry Mr Kamal.   Maybe one day he can read this and know how he was such an inspiration to me and my fellow peers. He eventually left the school a year after I graduated as he was awarded an MOE scholarship. I hope he's doing well now. I would love to have that Soul Calibur rematch. :)"

singapore,3d0b9m,dfuinghl,3,Sun Jul 12 14:44:33 2015 UTC,"A teacher I can never forget till today is the PE/CCA HOD of the secondary school I studied in. I've never understood why PE and CCA had to be combined into one department. It isn't as if every CCA in school is a sports CCA.  He was one of the school's most notorious teachers.  Being the social reject I was, one day I had lunch during recess time alone. All of sudden while I was eating, he sat himself across the table in front of me and threateningly interrogated my food choices.  ""Why are you eating rice? Are you new?""  I was so frightened that I just nodded at whatever he said.  ""You'd better watch out. Very soon you'll be under my care.""  True enough I was eventually enrolled into the TAF Club scheme, which was supervised by him and took up half of our daily recess period.  I was very lucky I never got him as PE teacher throughout all four years. During one year, my class would have PE lessons next to his class... and we would be witness to some of the worst PE lessons ever taught in history.  For the first lesson of the year, he sat his class down and embarked on long stories about his glorious past as an athlete. Word was that he would do this at the start of every year for new classes.  He also particularly picked on obese students in his own class. He would ask that one obese student in his class to continue his push-ups while the rest of his class move on to other exercises. To think that I would be THAT student if I were in his class.  Being the HOD for CCA too, he treated my IT Club (was President then) as a dumping ground for performing arts CCA rejects - choir, band, drama rejects. Those who'd always skip CCA would find themselves being sent to IT Club, and ironically enjoy being there because they could play computer games all day. It was so frustrating because our IT Club was soon infested with uninterested people who just weren't serious at all."

He was very tall, even as an adult, and loved to show off his athleticism (running, basketball). And typical of us kids back then, we still respected him because he's ""an adult"" and probably knew better than us. Now that I think of it though, I should've said something about him back then.

I bring it in to school, approach my teacher to tell her about it thinking it wasn't a big deal.  When my teacher saw this, she picked me up by the collar off the ground, while shaking me and yelling in my face. I was crying uncontrollably and ready to shit and wet myself in front of the class right there. I'd never been so scared in my life at that point.  Luckily my parents stood up for me and went back to give her an earful the next day. JUSTICE. I still don't react well to people yelling at me to this day (boy, NS was fun), so fuck you, bitch teacher.  Edit: I also had another teacher in first year of JC who told me I was a being a spoiled brat when I was having an anxiety attack in her class.

I was an unpredictable and loud kid at that time so it bothered her loads. We obviously didnt get along. P5 camp came along. T, being the form teacher, had to oversee us on the campgrounds so she witnessed a very very 'disturbing' thing I did. What did I do? I found a huuuuge hammer at the base of a tree and began playing with it, hammering away at the poor trunk just for laughs. Then, I hid the hammer away as T approached me and asked me what I was doing. I said that I wanted to come out at night and play with the hanmer jokingly and she just flipped out inside.   So we were put to bed and in the fuckin dead of night this bitch T woke me up and told me to pack my things because I'm going home and that all the teachers want me to leave. So ok I packed my things waited for my parents. While T was on the phone with me nan, she cried about how scary and unpredictable I was blah blah that she was afraid of the safety of other students and that I would hammer them in their sleep and stuff like that. Fast forward 5 minutes later, something me nan said made her cry like a baby and she apologized a ton saying she was preggo and her mood swings made her say that.   Later in the car, me nan said T should take maternity leave and that shes in no condition to teach. It's 12am and T made me nan drive past cemetaries and dark stretches of roads in order to pick me up. Fuck T and her ineptitude for education. She isn't fit to be a teacher because she doesn't know how to make accomodations and good decisions.   Secondary 1-2: Lets call her N and him, H. N and H worked as a team throughout our secondary 1 to 2 life and got most of our class into the best classes of sec 3 (pure sciences, A maths and stuff). We considered N our friend, a mentor and a role model. Although she joined our school the same year we did, she proved herself to be the best form teacher we had. We eventually attended N wedding, then H's wedding, multiple bbqs and chalets and still keep in contact 5 years later.  Speaking about H, he changed his handwriting for us-what I consider to be the most challenging thing to do in the world-he did it anyway. He would also invite us over to his house in order to revise certain subjects before hugely important tests and this helped us a lot. After secondary 2, H had to leave because he needed to help out in his family's business. We missed him.  What happened to N? She became the form teacher of the smartest graduating class in our school and taught pure sciences. Nevertheless, my classmates in her form class did well for the O levels and moved on to awesome poly courses. You could say our class made her career and at the same time transformed us into outstanding individuals.  Grade 12: Lets call her S. S is an AP English teacher who has taught for many years but this year was horribly hard for her due to a shortage of teachers and as such, her schedule was tightly packed with classes back to back. S was also in charge of teaching the dimmest to brightest students in Senior year of High School so it was extreme hardwork and dedication not to break down.   One time I had to make up 11 hours of school just so I can keep my credits and I choose to stay in S's class after school everyday in order to make those missing hours up. In the process of this, I learnt more about S. I saw S more than a teacher. She was a friend, advisor and also a confidante. I wasn't the best student but she was patient with me and helped me understand literary concepts. As a result, S made me think deeper and opened up my mind about everything in general."
singapore,3d0b9m,oneqeightyfour,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:10:42 2015 UTC,"When I was in Sec 2, we had this trainee teacher from NIE. Obviously she was young and didn't know better (or did she?), because of all days, on the day that we were having our Science class test, she decides to wear a khaki colored skirt that was quite see-through. How did we know? We could see through the skirt and see that she was wearing a G-string! Mind you, this was a class test so during the entire lesson she was basically walking up and down the rows of tables in our classroom. The boys in the class were very delighted and what made it fun for them was that everybody were thinking the same thing and were trying to communicate that to each other, but at the same time having to keep quiet and pretend to focus on their work because it was class test! Needless to say, an incident like that never happened again throughout her stint at our school.  Another story occurred when I was in J1. It was right after the June holidays, and we expected nothing from the morning announcement but usual boring stuff. However, apparently we have a bunch of new teachers and one of them was this really good looking guy who looks like a cross between a Hollywood and Bollywood actor. The girls were already swooning from afar despite not having a clear view of him. Soon after, we found out that we were privileged enough to be taught by him. I swear the girls almost wet their panties. Anticipation was very high, and then we went for our first lecture with him. I must admit, he looks really really good for the eyes. The girls were just batting their eyelashes and such. And then.......... he spoke."

At least Heroes is casual enough to just pick up and play usually though, so that's something.

It's just not a thing I can do any more. If that means I play the Fischer Price MOBA, then hey, if I'm having fun, why not?   Half an hour of my time is worth a lot more than however many dollars HOTS is asking from me, not that I've actually paid anything yet. But I wouldn't hesitate to do so. I've already spent hundreds on Hearthstone, making money is not a bad thing.  In fact, if you care about the game, making money is a good thing. Hero Academy is by far the best game that I have ever played. The game design is outstanding. The monetisation is horrible. And because it's not earning money, it's getting dropped."

Not as much as the technical failings of LOL and DOTA2 (how is last hit still a thing), but in general, I dislike games in which you have to play to a meta. Pick/Ban is the worst thing.  I guess I'm coming from Street Fighter, where there were 8-2 matchups, but unless you were playing in a tournament you were more or less sure that you would have a reasonable fight. Hearthstone is practically all meta all the time, which is why I'm looking for an alternative, but if it turns out HOTS is like that as well.. meh. We'll see. Anyway, MOBAs are so big, I should at least know how they're played, maybe my son will play them in the future. I just hope he's not into FPS. >.>"

If you're in winners you have the advantage of not counterpicking first and forcing your opponent to deal with the counterpick if the bracket is reset for example. The pick/ban thing is sometimes used to play against the players rather than used to play the meta. It doesn't matter how good you are at a certain character that has a good match up against mine if I know the match up perfectly and you don't. Lamenting how a game is played won't make you any better. Learning how to use every aspect of the game to help you win will.    I guess I'm coming from Street Fighter, where there were 8-2 matchups   8-2 match ups assume a few things: perfect execution and perfect knowledge. I main cody and the Sagat match up is supposed to be like 7-3 but if the Sagat doesn't know how to or when to Kara Tiger uppercut, I'd say the match up easily becomes 6-4 in my favour."
singapore,3d0w0o,bjarkebjarke,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:55:19 2015 UTC,"Nope, I meant knowing how to play the game. When to push, when to capture objectives, when to take bosses or merc camps, when to leave a guy on lane to soak experience, etc. You can be mechanically gifted but if you don't know how to play the game, you're going to lose. Since you come from an SF background, basically you can have godlike execution but still lose if you don't understand the match up. Knowledge > skill in HOTS.   That's cool. I like that.    Lamenting how a game is played won't make you any better. Learning how to use every aspect of the game to help you win will.   And I don't like this. I know that it's part of the game (from a macro perspective, including the parts that are not part of the gameplay), but I don't like it. Pick/ban basically means that you don't have character specialists, it basically admits that characters aren't balanced against each other, and that you need a safety valve to allow a character or composition to not be played. I only mained Rose in SF4, if there was a pick/ban system, I would just not be able to play. Nothing to do with my spacing, reactions, mixups - if my opponent bans Rose, I just flat out can't play. OR, the developers are like ""well Rose vs Yun is a 8-2 matchup but you can just ban Yun so we'll leave that matchup alone"". That's just not acceptable, IMO. If you implement a character, the implied promise (to my mind) is that I will be able to play that character. Sure, if you scope the ""game"" out to include character selection (literally, ""meta""-game means the part of the game that's outside the game), that's just part of the game, but I don't like that. I want to play Rose because I want to play Rose, I don't want to have to pick sub characters just because Yun is popular this month.  That's just my view though. I understand people in general are ok with ""the game outside of the game"", to the point where picking characters is just considered part of the strategy, but I don't like it."
singapore,3d0w0o,tehokosong,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:28:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah but not having bans is how sf is played. You can't apply the same logic to mobas. It's like an MK player saying that crossups should not be allowed in sf because they don't have it in MK.  Bans and picks are part of mobas. It's not that you can't have character specialists, you can. But your best character might be banned against you OR teams could develop a strategy where they bait you to pick your best character by not banning it, but rendering them worthless because of team comp (watch EDG vs SKT T1 for reference, they left LeBlanc open for Faker and rekt him for that choice). As mentioned, it's not a matter of if characters are imbalanced but a matter of strategy. Sometimes you want to play a certain strategy, so you ban certain characters that would interfere with this or render that strategy useless/harder to do. An example for this is aoe cc strategies in dota involving blink daggers. If you want to play that strategy, you want to ban spectre because haunt prevents you from utilizing your blink daggers in team fights. If you ban spectre first however, the opponent will immediately suspect something like this and may ban magnataur or enigma in response.   It's like a minigame of chess that determines how you will play the actual game later. To me I find ban/pick phases the most fascinating to watch at the professional level (if you understand it) because it demonstrates a certain level of trickery and deception and yet the aim is still to get a suitable composition of characters to win the game. Even pick and ban order is essential to this entire mini game of chess.  Edit: you might want to read David Sirlin's Play To Win."

Even pick and ban order is essential to this entire mini game of chess.   I agree with everything you said in this paragraph, but I still don't like pick/ban. Like you said, it's like a minigame before the game, and I don't want to have a minigame before the game.   No other game does this, and while it does give some form of additional complexity, it's not complexity that I like. Can you imagine if say, you could ban a formation in football, or ban a player? To take your aoe cc/haunt example, I feel that the game should be balanced such that if I want to do aoe cc, there shouldn't be a ""hard counter"" of haunt. Soft counters that I can play around, fine, but to have such a hard counter such that if the other team picks this I lose, I feel that's just poor balancing of the game.  To pick a Hearthstone example, Kezan Mystic vs Freeze Mage. Kezan Mystic is a tech choice that absolutely prevents Freeze Mage from being played. It's such a hard counter that once the meta gets a significant number of Freeze Mage, Kezan comes right out and stops it cold (haha). I really, really dislike this. It's like the developers intentionally designed a 10-0 matchup, but then said ""well just ban it then"". Same for aoe cc vs Haunt - if there was no ban in place, either aoe cc would not be a thing, or if it were fun, then there would be more soft counters rather than just a hard counter than you could ban.  The nearest similarity I can think of is in RTS, actually, where you had to scout or face a build order loss. In that scenario, scouting is ""kind of like"" the pick/ban phase, where each of the players isn't really interacting, but rather finding out the other player's strategy and attempting to counter. At the very least, that was in-game, and there were ways to deny scouting etc, where information on what you are doing has real value."

Can you imagine if say, you could ban a formation in football, or ban a player?   I think you're misunderstanding something. While no other game has a ban/pick phase, many other games have some form of pre-game strategizing that would be similar to the ban/pick phase. They may not be equal or complete substitutes, but they are similar.   You don't need to ban a formation or player in football because selecting formations and placing players in then IS the pre-game phase.    To take your aoe cc/haunt example, I feel that the game should be balanced such that if I want to do aoe cc, there shouldn't be a ""hard counter"" of haunt. Soft counters that I can play around, fine, but to have such a hard counter such that if the other team picks this I lose, I feel that's just poor balancing of the game.   You don't lose. There are many workarounds. Force staff/Lothar's edge, but all unoptimal choices for the said aoe cc strategy. It's not a hard counter, but for the most part, people would rather not have to deal with it. If spectre is banned there are other substitutes, but non-optimal too: Zeus and his ultimate for example.  Street fighter has an exact equivalent to ban/pick imo. It's the first round of the first game. Most players will try and get a 'feel' of their opponent and what they can do. Throw a fireball, see if he can counter. The opponent likewise, has a choice: choose to counter and show his cards, or act like a fool and be 'trapped' by the fireballs. Jump and see if his aa is good. Opponent can choose to aa or play the fool again. It's all very similar to the ban/pick where everything has a risk and reward.   Well but at the end of the day, it's just a preference thing. If you can't deal with the ban/pick phase just don't play the game I guess."

There's no real easy way to deal with this type of situation, although some other subreddits have tried. For example, /r/forex has a hard rule that news articles posted should include a comment by the OP with his/her own analysis or question relating to the article. This would hopefully discourage individuals from spam linking news articles related to the subreddit, while at the same time allowing for a restriction on not editorialising the post title as the OP is allowed to state their own personal opinions or slant in the accompanying comment.

It does not usually cause disease in healthy individuals. However, in adults, GBS may occasionally cause infections of the skin, joints, heart and brains. The risk factors for GBS infection include underlying chronic or co-morbid conditions."

This riot is one of the most famous and important riots during the Prisoners' Rights Movement. The riot was based upon prisoners' demands for political rights and better living conditions. On September 9, 1971, two weeks after the killing of George Jackson at San Quentin, about 1,000 of the Attica prison's approximately 2,200 inmates rebelled and seized control of the prison, taking 42 staff hostage.  During the following four days of negotiations, authorities agreed to 28 of the prisoners' demands [citation needed], but would not agree to demands for complete amnesty from criminal prosecution for the prison takeover or for the removal of Attica's superintendent. By the order of state Governor Nelson Rockefeller, state police took back control of the prison. When the uprising was over, at least 43 people were dead, including ten correctional officers and civilian employees, and 33 inmates.    Image i - Attica Prison entrance.

Well there used to be a subculture a decade or so ago - not sure if it's still as prevalent - of the 'sarong party girl'. Go look it up. Basically, there are some Singaporean girls who are absolutely obsessed with having a Western boyfriend (what we call an 'ang moh') because Western men are apparently richer, better in bed, etc.   I think it's just a novelty thing. If you were white in another Asian country which has a small white population, you'd probably get the same reaction. Media stereotypes of white men also play a role in this - for many Singaporean girls who don't have white friends, the only white men they 'know' are Brad Pitt and co. so there is an idealised image.   Just make the most of it. I don't think Singaporean girls are more open when it comes to hookups at all. Of course, exceptions abound. Beware that some of them may just be flirting with you for the fun of it/just to tell their friends that an angmoh guy bought drinks for them last night."

singapore,3d3mkz,GreenTea-San,3,Mon Jul 13 10:43:14 2015 UTC,"Many people have a thing for white people, it is common in Asia. I'm one of them. I like white girls more than I like Asian girls. And the girls who hit on you at the clubs are the same. They like white. There is a level of exoticism in snagging someone white, and we also like the social proof that comes with it. White people here tend to be higher paid and considered a few strata above locals, and we like to be upwardly mobile.  There is gold-digging behavior too, but it is easy to sniff out. Most of the girls who hit on you don't fall into this category. Personally speaking, I have had trouble hooking up with Singaporean girls, but my white friends don't seem to have any problems with that. It's not racist or gold-digging: it's simply the rules of attraction that apply. A girl finds white attractive, hence finds you attractive, hence she's more open to going home with you.  Pro tips: stick to clubs where regular people go, and not the ones with hookers. They are hard to avoid these days, but if you're new here, this is a list of places where you have a much better chance of interacting with normal girls, and you can see if you're still being hit on.   Attica One Raffles Place Kyo One Altitude China One   I'm not including Ku De Ta (now Ce La Vie), because there are so many Asian girls just ready to latch on to the first white guy in sight."

singapore,3d2feg,irlando,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:15:53 2015 UTC,does this count for higher skilled jobs as well such as market research analysts and business analysts?
singapore,3d2feg,Axewhy,5,Mon Jul 13 00:22:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, we have lots of uni grads and not enough suitable jobs for them. Despite the low unemployment rate, youth unemployment rate was quite high last year iirc and there were loads of reports about many fresh grads being underemployed.   So S/E passes are harder to get and with the foreign worker levy you are basically 10-20%+ more expensive to hire than a local worker so you have to be really outstanding to get hired in an entry level position.  edit: An easier way to get a job in Singapore is to get hired overseas in a company which has a posting in Singapore. Usually these positions are niche or has been open for some time which makes it easier for them to justify the pass approval."
singapore,3d2feg,irlando,-2,Mon Jul 13 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"don't really know why that was downvoted, but ok.  Thanks very much for your reply!

singapore,3d2feg,HaaNotSure,2,Mon Jul 13 01:56:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. When issuing work visas (which must be sponsored by a potential employer), the government will look at not just your educational qualifications, but your work experience to date too. The question in the government mind is always ""Could they hire a Singaporean to do this job?"" At graduate level, the answer is almost always yes."
singapore,3d2feg,HaaNotSure,2,Mon Jul 13 03:18:16 2015 UTC,"I have a few friends who recently started out in the financial industry in Singapore, some foreign and some local. Best example is probably a friend who just started in wealth management at J.P. Morgan and is earning $100-110k as an analyst. For other firms & back/middle office roles you could probably benchmark against UK salaries as they range depending on role, probably looking at $35-70k.  I suppose the J.P Morgan guy is the best example as he is a Belgian resident, he applied to the J.P Morgan private banking graduate role which had global scope, lucked out a little and ended up in Singapore but he was able to put a preference in. If I could recommend anything it would be to start applying now and see if you get any bites, it'll be quite hard breaking in on a dependent pass as work visas aren't easy to get as I'm sure you've heard.  Let me know if there's anything else I could help with. FYI I'm a British xpat with PR status in Singapore, served my 2 years of NS but am living and studying in the UK atm.

singapore,3d2feg,xxcoldfuzionxx,2,Tue Jul 14 20:58:22 2015 UTC,Thanks very much for the reply! Glad to hear it worked out for your friend. Did your belgian friend intend on moving to singapore to start out with or did it kind of just happen?  What sort of things are you considering that may make you want to stay in the UK?
singapore,3d2feg,chipmunk7884,2,Tue Jul 14 21:29:26 2015 UTC,"It just sort of happened. Obviously it being J.P he knows he will probably only be in Singapore for a short period but it's a killer start for him and opens plenty of doors in the future. It was probably his flexibility and lack of commitment that probably helped him secure it as it was a toss up between Singapore Dubai and the States.   As I'm also looking at entering the financial industry and am currently getting a first hand experience and look at the work-life balance and corporate climate here in the UK, so far I much prefer it. I'm basing my experience off various friends who have done internships or are working right now and it generally seems a little more conducive for maintaining sanity here, this of course heavily depends on the type of role you want. My friends liken the fin. district (Raffles Place) to an Asian Wall St and your head is basically on the chopping block but the executioner isn't quite ready to do the deed. But hey the pay is great and tax is hard to beat!  I get asked this question whenever I speak to the other guys here and it's quite hard to nail down all the factors that would make me decide to stay. I'll probably know a little better in a few months :)."
singapore,3d2feg,alexong5011,4,Tue Jul 14 21:45:32 2015 UTC,"Hello, similar boat to you, but 4 years ago.  In Singapore's current political climate, the following criteria will be quite important for you:  1) What your nationality is 2) What school you graduated from 3) The salary you can get in the market  Based on this, you would get an employment pass (and worst case, an S-pass).  Your gf will have no impact on your application as she is neither a Singapore citizen nor permanent resident.  You would need to be working on an employment pass for a period of 2 years - 6 years before you're considered for PR under the PTS scheme.  Will be longer if you're on an S pass.  From my experience, this is the breakdown of starting salary of my peers who work in finance (analyst role) in SGD and not including bonuses (take it with a pinch of salt, this is 2011):  Harvard - 14k Berkley - 10k Michigan - 9k Singapore Management University - 5k National University Singapore - 4.5k Nanyang Technological University - 3.2k Management Development Institute of Singapore - 2.6k Monash University - 2.2k  As for housing, it can range from $250 a month per person for a 4 person shared bedroom (2 bunk beds per room) to $800~ for your own common room in someone's HDB and/or condo.  If you're looking for your own studio apartment or your own HDB (government housing) flat, expect to pay in excess of $2,500 per month.  The market is definitely in favour of tenants at the moment.  The role you're aiming for is a role many young Singaporeans are capable of doing and it's a job they want.  The best bet would be to get hired overseas and then ask to be posted to Singapore later on.  You would also get a higher salary as well as a better position."

It's insanely hot due to all the people cramped in the shaded areas (where the shops are) and if you go out of the shaded area then you bake under the sun. The shops are all cramped inside the shaded areas and the walking area is only around 4 people wide, so at peak period it's insanely difficult to browse the stores. However, it is quite good if you go there just to take pictures of cosplayers since theres alot of open spaces there. Though they aren't as many cosplayers at EoY as other conventions like AFA, CharaExpo and CosFest simply because of how bloody hot it is. Imagine wearing a full suit of armour under the hot sun for hours. Yeah  TL;DR: EoY is alright for taking pictures of cosplayers but terrible if you want to but stuff."

In the posting order, there were a list of 37 SAF items that I needed to bring in. I noticed some were not inside (e.g. camo cream, water bag, elbow/knee guards, assault pack etc). Do I need to bring in everything including those or just the 37 items listed? Do I book in with everything (incl. field pack) in my duffel bag or can I book in carrying a field pack on my back and dragging the duffle bag (i.e. 2 seperate bags)?   Thanks in advance."
singapore,3cycjj,dashrandom,4,Sun Jul 12 03:50:21 2015 UTC,"Usually there's an emart to buy these things. And you won't start exercises so soon, they'll have to train you vocationally first.  I used to be able to survive one week with just a very full field pack every time. Shouldn't be an issue if you bring 2 separately but might be a little overkill."
singapore,3cycjj,dasaher,2,Sun Jul 12 04:11:22 2015 UTC,"I know that. I already have those items, just that they are not listed on the posting order so I'm not sure if I have to bring those. Yeah, I tried stuffing everything in my duffel bag and there's almost no space to put in my personal belongings such as washing powder and snacks so I wonder if I can take out the field pack from the duffel bag and carry it on my back instead. I'm asking because the week before POP we had to stuff everything in the duffel bag when we brought everything that wasn't needed home; so I'm wondering if there's some kind of SAF regulation/rule that states you must put everything into your duffel bag/field pack in CV world."

singapore,3cycjj,dreadpiratewombat,3,Sun Jul 12 01:01:21 2015 UTC,"There are tons of grocery stores around CBD. Cold Storage will be most like what you're used to, fair price is really variable and giant is like an Asian take on Walmart. You'll quickly figure out which places to go for what you want.   Check with your boyfriends company to see if they have deals with any mobile carriers. I've been happy with StarHub but don't really have any other points of reference.   Definitely don't stress and try to do it all the second you get here. Take your time. It takes some adjustment. It'll take the better part of a year before you feel truly comfortable."

singapore,3cycjj,dtwn,2,Sun Jul 12 01:00:55 2015 UTC,Best bet would be the NTUC supermarket about ten+ minutes away at Amara/100 AM. Chinatown is also fairly close and has a lot of shops with the stuff you're looking for.

singapore,3cycjj,benfires,3,Sun Jul 12 21:33:36 2015 UTC,"For electronics I think SLS (Sim Lim Square) upper floors would be a good choice, but be prepared to walk a bit to compare prices.  Household appliances like hairdryers etc can be found in stores like Courts, Best Denki, etc. You'll have to see which one's more convenient for you I think.  For a cell, some telco may offer to give you a phone for free or at a discounted price when you sign up or renew a plan with them. Check them out. The 3 telcos in Singapore are M1, Starhub and Singtel in no particular order. There's plenty of outlets everywhere but I believe you can see the models they carry online. Bigger outlets also have the tendency to carry more stock and have a wider variety."

singapore,3cycjj,SoYppah,2,Sun Jul 12 12:35:08 2015 UTC,"It's nearer to bugis that side. If you're buying stuff from sim lim it's better to get a local to go with you if you'rs a foreigner cause they tend to jack up prices. I personally recommend fuwell or pc themes as I have patronised them before and their prices are not bad. (Then again these 2 shops are for pc related items)   If you're looking for run of the mill household items just go to courts, best denki or Harvey norman.    About han phone and plans: please ask for whatever they're including because some of them are tricky. e.g. For caller ID it's 5.35 a month but I don't think they will mention a flat one time first time activation charge of $20(I think it's 20). Exceeding data usage costs 10.70/gb exceeded(even if u exceed 0.00001 gb it still costs 10.70. Certain telCos have their own prices. bear in mind that you have a 24month contract with the telcos - terminating it prematurely will cost you money(a few hundreds)"
singapore,3cycjj,Asyrol,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:50:04 2015 UTC,Yikes! Sounds as bad as in Canada! I'll make sure to read all of the fine print carefully. Thank you :-)

singapore,3cycjj,dashrandom,-4,Sun Jul 12 08:50:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's a matter of priorities. At a certain age, whether they admit it or not, most girls no. 1 priority in a guy is sexual attraction (usually when they are young), they can describe it as many things like 'special feeling', 'emotional security', etc but they just basically wanna get fucked by that guy. That's the time they are most likely to cheat.  Of course that doesn't apply to everyone. Some people recognise that sexual desire is just a primal instinct and if we all gave in to our primal instincts, we'd pretty much be no more than animals. There are some other very important things to consider in a relationship; some of which we only learn from experience."
singapore,3cycjj,iwantsmoothballs,3,Sun Jul 12 16:01:04 2015 UTC,"most girls no. 1 priority in a guy is sexual attraction   Young or old, women can't help what they're attracted to. Men as well, for that matter. The guy they choose to marry, in most instances, isn't the one that they're most sexually attracted to. Rather, he's the most reliable and able to provide for her and their future offspring.   What's so funny is the cognitive dissonance that the girls I've met have when it comes to cheating. They know how fucked up it is, they claim they wish it never happened, but they know if they could cheat with no consequences they'd do it anyways."
singapore,3cycjj,dashrandom,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:53:32 2015 UTC,You can't choose who you're attracted to but you can choose how you react to it.   Yeah agree with the part on the cognitive dissonance.

It's common in this state to hallucinate, basically you're still dreaming, and when I get sleep paralysis I often see or feel a scary presence near me, and my body shakes uncontrollably.   For years I thought this shaking was the bed shaking and a part of the hallucination/dream. However, recently I discovered it was just my body and if I calmed myself down and ignore the dream I could stop the shaking and wake up.  This all might sound farfetched, and it probably is unlikely in your partner's case.. but sleep paralysis is real, it runs in my family, and it's fucking scary!"

singapore,3cwe6j,hazevanilla,19,Sat Jul 11 09:54:13 2015 UTC,"Like the other 2 teachers who have responded (hello colleagues!), I'm not really sure why reddit seems more subversive to you than any other site. I teach in a boys' school and over the course of 4 years have seen far worse things than reddit in their browser history (""black salami"" comes to mind for a start - don't google it unless you have /r/eyebleach up on a separate tab!).  My students do know I reddit and some are redditors themselves; then again, I keep any sensitive information about myself on a throwaway. Like most of the Internet, reddit is neither a tool for good nor for bad, it really depends what you make of it. Several of our graduands use /r/worldnews for General Paper, etc.  On a separate note, the Ministry of Education is a large and popular employer among fresh grads in Singapore (source: http://m.todayonline.com/singapore/ministry-education-tops-employer-choice-survey); consequently, there is diversity and a mix of ages in our education officers. If you do intend to teach, it may not be helpful to join the service with the lingering idea that your colleagues are a bunch of stuffy pedants. My colleagues in school and HQ are some of the most interesting, active people I know. Additionally, most of us take care to separate our professional/public selves from our private lives, so I can be browsing /r/avocadosgonewild outside of class and no one need know :-)"

To elaborate a little, many of the topics here also come up on local sites like Stomp and HWZ.   Unless one of my kids suddenly experiences a drastic change in behaviour, it's unlikely I'd notice or care unless I'm particularly well acquainted with them. And if they exhibit drastic changes in behaviour, I would not consider Reddit as the catalyst as family or friends are far more likely causes.

singapore,3cx1i0,GrandBuffet,3,Sat Jul 11 22:29:54 2015 UTC,"Just to put some context on how small Hong Kong and Singapore flats are.  I asked a friend who works in HDB on the space planning norms for Singapore and Hong Kong public housing, because I had similar concerns. He told me that the Hong Kong government plans public housing at about 8 square metres per person (meaning a house for a family of 4 is about 32 sqm).   In Singapore, the planning norm is at least double. More for flats with more rooms. I believe new 5-room flats are at least 100 sqm each today."
singapore,3cx1i0,palysg,2,Sun Jul 12 01:41:22 2015 UTC,micro living is definitely not for me. So claustrophobic from the lack of space. sure it promotes a minimalistic living but I would rather that be an option instead of a restriction.

singapore,3cx1i0,milkmatchatea,0,Sun Jul 12 05:38:46 2015 UTC,"Home prices have been falling steadily for about a year now. Hopefully it keeps falling. Someone will lose no matter what. High price of homes means that young couples and first time buyers lose out. Low prices means that home owners will not be happy that the value of their homes are decreasing. So its not quite so simple. One group of people will eventually lose out no matter what the outcome is.  One way that you can get a bigger HDB for a lower price is to buy in non-mature estates. What you have to realise is that when our parents bought homes for cheap, they were in non-mature areas. Jurong East wasnt what it is right now. Back then there was only Shaw Entertainment Centre and IMM. IMM only had Giant and a bunch of furniture shops. Now of course homes in Jurong East would be expensive because of all the facilities that have sprung up around the area. So if you want to buy a home that was of a comparable(not similar) price to what your parents bought, you'd have to buy in an area that similarly has the lack of facilities that they faced.  And how is a house utilitarian? Do homes also have normative ethical value?"

If there was a communication breakdown between the nursing side and someone else's (say the lab's side)...ooh wait for it, NURSE'S FAULT. I got an Australia nursing degree and what do I do at work besides my usual? I check the printers in our dept to make sure there's enough paper so that the doctors won't flip when they can't print, I remind doctors to fill in the prerequisite paperwork before the patient can go into surgery (basically I'm reminding them to do their job), I have to CALL them to come to OT to remind them they have surgeries to do, I double check ALL their paperwork to ensure they type out the correct stuff, I book meals for them...and after all these, I get yelled at because just we're slow at handing them 10 instruments at a time (nurse, artery please, blade, roberts, do you have a lahey? Get a 10mm clip NOW! Where's my 5/0 Prolene???? throws instrument on my table) And if we complaint about this, the usual reply is it's the nurse's job (flips table). Wanna know the worse part? Our nursing managers are usually old and clinging to older traditions and hardly ever back you up. They don't even stand up for their younglings!   In Australia, well...doctor=nurse.   I'm sorry, I'm just ranting. I'll delete this once I've cooled off.

If you want your cousin to read, start with a book with lots of repetitive words and one sentence per page books with pictures for cues.

Honestly, many people buy cameras that they end up not using because it's too bulky/troublesome/heavy. The best camera is the one you have with you. (so your iPhone or Android), and personally I think they are good enough for most people nowadays for scenery and family funshots.   Then again, if you really insist on an entry level camera, you can get a second hand one on carousell or clubsnap at about $600-800. Some basic DSLR models around that price are Canon 650D or Nikon 5500D. If you want brand new, check out canon 100D or Nikon 3300D.   If you want mirrorless cameras, you can check out the sony a6000 for about $900 brand new.   And I personally prefer TKfoto."

singapore,3cwgea,eStonez,3,Sat Jul 11 11:30:51 2015 UTC,"Go mirrorless   Lighter than normal DSLR. Price of good mirrorless is similar to DSLR body without lens. DSLR quality depends on the lens, mid range travel lens cost about S$800 .. mirrorless usually come with similar (lower spec) travel lens. S$800 is very low budget for DSLR. You may get one/two step older DSLR kit (body+kit lens) for 800$ but those kit lens don't work for most inexperienced people. S$800 is good budget for mid-range mirrorless.  Due to high humidity Singapore weather, you need bigger dry box for DSLR + lens. For mirrorless, normal air-tight container with a couple of Silica Gel bags should do.   P.S : I have 2 DSLR bodies, 4 lens, 1 mirrorless and a camcorder. Usage-wise mirrorless is the lightest and required almost no amount of care."

Cameras I would consider are   Panasonic Lumix LX7 10 MP ( 24-90 mm ) S$550 Samsung NX3000 20MP (16-50mm ) S$700 Panasonic Lumix GF7K 16 MP ( 12-32mm) S$700 Olympus Pen Lite E-PL7 16 MP ( 14-42mm) S$800   Based on 800$ budget, I would go for Lumix GF7K.

Sensor size is also part of the consideration when getting a camera. Panasonic and Olympus has micro four third sensor. I personally don't like micro four thirds. But to each his own.  Google a6000 reviews or go youtube and watch review.  But in the end, photography is more of the lens than the body. So if you're in for the long run. Do look at what lens system suits you best."

singapore,3cwgea,BishyBashy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:22:45 2015 UTC,I use the 15mm F1.7. It's a Pana-leica lens and probably one of the most sharpest m4/3 lens. My go to lens for my street photography. That's the only lens I need.   The A7rII is an awesome camera but 42 megapickles? It's abit too much for me to be honest unless I'm shooting for commercial prints. But for the price it packs a punch. The leica q however is around the same price but the quality is so good and the lens is of course superb because it's a leica..

The problem is that I haven't had any ""user reviews"" outside of those on websites so I'm a little bit doubtful to whether I should break from the norm and get a Pentax, or if I should be considering a mirrorless instead.

singapore,3cwgea,MachDiamonds,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:50:46 2015 UTC,I heard good things about Pentax as well but to me the only downside is the smaller user base so buying second hand lens and when you want to sell your gear it becomes a hassle.

I'm definitely deliberating on it, but not too sure how it handles since nobody I know uses a Pentax. Gearswapping becomes an issue, too.  Thanks for your recommendation on the Sony a7 series - will look into it!"
singapore,3cwgy5,trinitynox,7,Sat Jul 11 10:42:15 2015 UTC,Go to a private university located in Singapore like the 90% of poly grads do. It's cheaper than going overseas and you have the option to do a part-time course so you can study while working.
singapore,3cwgy5,purebluejp,2,Sat Jul 11 11:43:59 2015 UTC,I think ST ran a front page article today. The numbers are up to 20% for poly. No longer 10%. And the entire cohort will have 40% in local universities by 2020.
singapore,3cwgy5,Wheat-gen-stein,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:44:57 2015 UTC,It's partly because people are getting wealthier and can afford to send their children overseas for Uni.
singapore,3cwgy5,LlamaNakama,4,Sun Jul 12 07:37:17 2015 UTC,"Realistic options are Unisim(full time), Unisim(part time), SIT or SIMGE. Your GPA could probably get you into NTU engineering or science courses. But because you chose to study non-science, that option is not open to you. That said, UniSIM and SIT are not bad options. Both are new local programs but are Govt backed and subsidised.  If you choose the private route, SIM-UOL is quite reputable among the available courses. And it's not that expensive either.  IMO, don't waste money overseas. If you can't get into a reputable uni overseas, you'd just be wasting your money. The ROI from going to SIM-UOL would be higher than going to most low-mid tier overseas uni."
singapore,3cwgy5,Wheat-gen-stein,3,Sat Jul 11 13:43:49 2015 UTC,"Going overseas is only ever a good option if the university in question is more reputable, or at least on par with, the local big 3 (NUS, NTU and SMU). I don't think it will be nice of you to have your parents pay for your education overseas otherwise, especially since you don't have anyone but yourself to blame for this predicament in which you're mired.   I would advise you to work very hard and pull your GPA up as much as possible. You might not end up in any of the local universities, but it'll be nice to know that you've at least put in effort. This will make you feel better.  Signing on is not something I would recommend. It is essentially chaining yourself to a life that you may not like."
singapore,3cwgy5,twentysevenpercent,3,Sat Jul 11 14:40:51 2015 UTC,"Hi OP, have You considered Finland as a course of study? They require You to take SATs though.  The education is free for foreigners there as well. Just need to show proof that you're able to live there. Need to deposit money In a bank account and they will allow You to withdraw a certain amount every month from it. Think Finland Education is pretty reputable, so Your parents should approve of them.   Austria, Germany also offers the same option. However, there are more courses available in English for Finland as compared to the rest."

singapore,3cwgy5,Locnil,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:56:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I got an offer but I didn't go in the end. Couldn't get them to offer me the 5 years masters program. Thing to note is that application starts in Jan, ends around June. (: cost of living is about 9000 Euros a year? That's what they ask You to put in the bank account."
singapore,3cwgy5,UnparagonedWisdom,3,Sat Jul 11 19:12:14 2015 UTC,"I don't have anyone but myself to blame for the situation that I've gotten into.   I don't think you're doing terribly. 3.14 out of 4.00 is decent. Not spectacular to gain admission into the Biz schools in Singapore, but not terrible. Think positively!    I suppose the best path for me is to try to get into a management course or something equivalent but it will be tough to gain admission into local options.   Do you actually enjoy management? If you do not, may I suggest taking some time to think of your interests? For instance, are you good in Mathematics? Are you good with your hands (or enjoy practical work)? Just some examples.   I think it is great that you have some luxury of time while serving your NS obligations. I am not completely sure how admission works, but you could look at SIT/SUTD/SIM. I think these are more ""practical"" options as compared to overseas universities. Assuming that you are looking for a job in Singapore upon graduation, these options are more viable. While it is true that foreign schools in Europe/Scandinavia offer subsidies/grants/whatever-you-call-it to foreign students, hiring managers in Singapore may not look upon them too well.    My parents are willing to fund me for university but only if they approve of the school.    It is only fair that they give their approval for the school, considering they are the ones funding you. An overseas, reputable education does not come cheap. Should you decide to pursue an overseas degree, my advice would be to think twice and seek out seniors/professionals in that field.   SIM does have Biz courses. Like others have said, the ROI is better. Most hiring managers would look upon SIM more favourably rather than XYZ Uni from a far-flung country...    signing on? Is that a viable option?   Not without a degree... I think your cGPA will be decent enough to go to a Uni (just which one). Don't waste that. The progression is very slow without a degree. I'm female and I don't have to serve NS, but I've heard enough to know.  Cheers, OP, I hope you will think positively and enjoy the rest of your poly life :)"
singapore,3cwgy5,gnomesrome,5,Sat Jul 11 16:13:01 2015 UTC,SIM is calling you.
singapore,3cwgy5,nyvrem,2,Sat Jul 11 12:40:20 2015 UTC,Why not at least try to apply for unis in Australia? Research on viable universities and talk to your parents about them. And don't even think about signing on when you only have a diploma. You will be at the bottom of the food chain in an environment of good local degree holders and overseas scholars.
singapore,3cwgy5,myepicdemise,2,Sat Jul 11 11:37:53 2015 UTC,"Is it really a must for you to go for a university education? I'm not trying to stop you, its your choice.   But think about it  before making your decision. Will it really help you in your future? Ever considered going straight to the workforce? Sign on?  I know it will be hard for you to accept this but education is not something to mess around and expect everything to be handed to you. You should have worked hard, plan for your goals etc.. instead."
singapore,3cwgy5,deeazy,3,Sat Jul 11 11:39:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. my poly gpa was even worse than yours (I blame myself too....) and I decided to start working instead of going to a uni. I'm a girl so no ns.   after working, I realised that I lost all interest to continue my path in science. instead, I gained more and more interest in my current job. now I'm working in the day and studying at unisim at night pursuing smtg related to my current job. the course I'm studying now is totally smtg i did not consider when I graduated from poly.   when you work first instead of jumping straight to uni, you get to realise that sometimes, the job you wanted may not be the job for you afterall.  good luck, OP."
singapore,3cwgy5,notyoursoulsister,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:34:27 2015 UTC,"What course are you looking to study? Business schools are highly competitive so its tough. And personally, I don't find that they are worth the effort.   If you're open to studying other fields like social sciences, engineering, design, chances might be higher. Most jobs require a degree but don't specify what kind of degree anyway. And i think taking something more specific, rather than generic like management, makes you a little more marketable."
singapore,3czj60,holllatmee,23,Sun Jul 12 05:07:53 2015 UTC,"Oh god. Before you try to get switched into a combat vocation, talk to some of your friends actually in those vocations before you make that decision. I don't mean those who were newly posted in either; talk to people who're finishing up or at least in their 2nd year.  One thing I advise is that if you choose to do it, do it only because you want to. 'Cause no one outside of NS will care whether you were in some sort of chiong sua, do ATEC type of unit or if you sat in an air-con room from 8-5 doing admin work.   ever heard of a PES A clerk?   Yes. It's actually rather common. I get the idea that you're feeling self-conscious about being a clerk. Really man, no one judges or even cares, lol."

You better be damn sure it's what you want if you somehow get the opportunity to switch to a combat role. Because ultimately, NS doesn't matter at all, it's not gonna define what you do later in life. Imo, best to be as comfortable as possible for the 2 years you're in there."

singapore,3czj60,NSsucks,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:12:02 2015 UTC,"Hmm... School (up to JC) is actually kinda easier than stay out life (or stay in life, or anything to do with NS to be honest).   I was out of training for 3 months, half way through OCS, and hence also had experience as a clerk.  I would say my time as a staff officer is the most fulfilling, since I was doing actual work that mattered (well..). However, the most fun I had was during my training days (BMT and OCS). Contrary to what most believed, my lowest point was actually my 3 month clerk posting, where I was truly useless, did nothing and practically invisible. All I could do to keep my morale up was bring in self-learning books and occupy my time."
singapore,3czj60,awesterdam,0,Mon Jul 13 01:12:31 2015 UTC,"Then you had a shitty experience being a clerk.  I was a clerk. We played dumb pranks on each, trolled forums, went out on dispatch, yum cha tcss session, and a whole bunch of other fun shit that I will not mention. I don't know what it was like in your unit, but your time is what you make of it. Also, as an officer, you need to make yourself available to your men, and bring yourself down to their level hierarchy-wise. The grunts are usually the ones who do all the dumb and fun shit. If you don't open yourself up to them, then they'll never show that side to you, because you're an officer.   my lowest point was actually my 3 month clerk posting, where I was truly useless, did nothing and practically invisible   That is your opinion, and I respect that. However, for many out there, we do not believe in giving our all for NS. I'd already given 2.5 years of my life. I did not, and still don't, believe in giving anymore for NS. Doing as little as I could, and staying invisible, were all part of that."

If you believe you possess such great potential, then save it for your life after NS. Literally no one gives or will give a shit what your vocation is, and it defines nothing about you. However, say you are indeed able to switch to a ""more important/prestigious/etc"" vocation, and you tell others about it either during a normal talk cock session, or when trying to sell yourself to a potential employer. While not overt, their reactions will likely be similar to the comments you've already gotten so far in this thread.

Every man has their role to play in the army.

OP, good on you for wanting to do it.  Speak to your department head as well as warrant officers in your department. If need be/ if it exists, speak to the S1 of your unit. Only asking them once will probably not be enough. Bug them at least every week just so they know you're serious.  The thing is though, the SAF tends to have already planned out everything nicely, meaning that it's hard to switch as it will disrupt what has already been planned. Your unit will have to find a new clerk, you might be taken up an extra slot in leadership training, etc etc. So go in with an open mind, and be happy if you succeed!"

As many people have said, it won't really matter in your later life. NS is just a short stage of our lives, and I barely remember the time I spent as a clerk.  Ultimately, I do think only you can decide what's best for yourself, but you should consider your immediate and future health the first and foremost priority. If you think you might slip back into depression if you are inactive, then yea, it might be good to pursue something more to your liking.   My suggestion, gym gym gym and more gym. You won't find more free time in your life to do so, clerk or not! I used my free time to gym and I was at my fittest in NS, and at the same time I wasn't risking my health doing more physical tasks. You may think the risk is insignificant, but if you break your leg, tear a tendon, you COULD be still feeling the after-effects 20 years down the road, and for what? Those 2 years of NS?

Coz you're in a relatively grey area; a Pes A whose medically unfit. So you gotta clear that up first.

singapore,3cwrhl,Stealthstriker,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:36:29 2015 UTC,"It'll be significant for discretionary admission. I've seen a few friends obtain the extra edge using non-academic achievements to get in... It'll help if you have some leadership positions, or competition achievements! Does your school do CIP? You can include that in your SGC too. / Decent grades are definitely a must, but year after year the cohort seems to be improving as a whole, so with that competition rises as well. The difference between two people with the same grades will be their non-academic achievements. But if your grades are decent enough to put you in the higher bracket of all the applicants, then you're safe. But must be higher bracket lah... And that's quite an ambiguous thing for us students to judge also :/ Errrr... Better not. If there comes a point in time when you have to attend an interview and they ask you questions about what you wrote in your SGC, I don't think it's that easy to paint a perfect picture with no loopholes... I think they'll know if you're lying. (EDIT: I forgot about this... You can't lie about your achievements, your school won't let that happen. They check everything.) The easiest way for me was via my CCA. If your CCA goes for competitions, try your best to get into one. Award or not, it'll be enough to write about as one achievement in your SGC. If your school does CIP and it's compulsory, then good, because that counts as an achievement too. I went to apply to be an OGL for Orientation because I thought it was fun (and it was fun!) and that also turned out to be quite an experience... Included that in my SGC too. (But please don't apply to be an OGL just to have it in your SGC!! You need to like what you're doing while you're doing it!)   Bottom line is... Don't worry too much about your SGC. It'll come together properly by the end of your JC life. Don't participate in stuff left and right just to have a ton of things to include in your SGC. Focus on your studies too, if you got that rock steady everything else will be fine for you. Enjoy your JC life!!! I graduated last year and I kinda miss it despite the stress and all :("
singapore,3cwrhl,junnir,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:19:24 2015 UTC,"It is very insignificant. All you need to get into Uni courses here are good grades. Even with a sterling SGC, you will still not be considered for discretionary admissions unless your A-level grades are also pretty good. IMO, don't bother about the SGC. Focus on your grades."

singapore,3cv1f4,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz,2,Sat Jul 11 04:31:36 2015 UTC,"Interesting point. The next thing we know the hawker/groceries stalls where the prostitutes get their food from will be prosecuted.   Persons living on or trading in prostitution  146.—  (1)  Any person who knowingly lives wholly or in part on the earnings of the prostitution of another person shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years and shall also be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000.  (2)  Any male person who is convicted of a second or subsequent offence under this section shall, in addition to any term of imprisonment imposed in respect of such offence, be liable to caning.  (3)  Where any person is proved to live with or be habitually in the company of any prostitute or is proved to have exercised control, direction or influence over the movements of any prostitute in such a manner as to show that the person is aiding, abetting or compelling her prostitution with any other person or generally, the person shall, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be deemed to be knowingly living on the earnings of prostitution.    I guess the keyword here is aiding?"
singapore,3cv63f,rebrander,5,Sat Jul 11 01:10:50 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Choosing what you would choose as if the money doesn't matter is a pretty good way to go about it. There is however a caveat that sometimes the place you want to live in doesn't have the kind of job you want to do.  NUS Chemical Engineering grad here, with 3+ years of experience in the oil & gas industry as a process engineer, changed industry and now working as a software engineer in the tech industry.  Biggest U-turn (8 years) of my life.  Is there anything in particular that you would like to know?   Classic chemical engineering industries are oil & gas, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors.  If you really want to know more about chemical engineering/oil & gas industry/maybe bits of computer engineering we can meet up and have a chat. I don't mind spending 1 afternoon (or more if you need) to lower chances of someone else making the kind of U-turn I am making. Of course I won't be able to give a very wholesome perspective like a 15 yr old industry veteran can. You should also visit on-campus course sessions held by the departments to hear from faculty (all you need to know is Newton's 3rd law ;) ) and sometimes industry vets.  Do some homework, have a look at http://chbe.nus.edu.sg/curriculum and similar pages for the various fields you want to enter. If you have curiosity about specific modules and I happen to have the course textbook/notes (of course chemical engineering only) I can bring them along and you can have a feel for what you are getting yourself into."
singapore,3cv63f,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:13:03 2015 UTC,"Wow! I would definitely like to meet you face to face! I'm still undecided about what industry to go into as a chemical engineer, if I still want to be a chemical engineer."
singapore,3cv63f,MrBottle,2,Sat Jul 11 07:36:32 2015 UTC,"Are you in the graduating batch? If not have you gone for your industrial attachment/internships? Did you like the work that you did, and the kind of progression your colleagues had? If not you should interact with seniors and take their advice into considerations when you get the chance to.  Is there any kind of work that you imagine yourself doing? A career path is more about you than the industry. Do you like sales/negotiation? Do you like design/engineering/calculations? Research? Project management? Analyzing things? Do you like sitting at a desk all day in an office job or running around in a plant? Do you want to be in Singapore most of the time or are you mobile (mobility is really important in some industries)? Work-life balance? Is a good pay non-negotiable? Some of these will be incompatible with others, some paths can eventually get you to where you want to be, some faster than others. So do your research.   Do you know yourself well enough? Have you explored and placed yourself in enough uncomfortable situations to learn more about yourself? You may think you hate something but actually like it once you have thrown yourself into that situation. Have you considered interning outside of typical chem eng roles?  I can't really give any insight on how to choose between the industries as I only worked in one, and I barely understand my old one given how huge and far reaching it is.   There are of course particularities of industries. The exploration, development and production of fields part of oil & gas (upstream) is pretty cyclical and dependent on oil prices (like reaaally dependent). This is even more so for consultancies as they have neither assets of their own to operate nor manufacturing backlogs to count on and will crunch quickly when projects get delayed or halted due to low oil prices.   I know of people who went to sell insurance during the previous crunch, and then came back to the industry when it recovered. And apparently this is quite a normal thing, and due to retrenchments and hiring freeze in bad times, you might get a better package when the boom starts again, because there would be a severe lack of experienced personnel for projects.   And that's just one aspect of one small portion of the O&G industry. It's so huge that I am sure there are positions for all sorts of people, as long as they like the industry and can stomach its implications.  So if not a chemical engineer, what else are you considering? Govt job? Banks? Teaching?"

singapore,3cv63f,michaelconnery1985,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:16:44 2015 UTC,Made a similar Uturn just before my graduation. And started working as a Software Engineer right from the start.  Are you considering a MS in CS? I'm considering doing one but need to seek the Pros and Cons of it. What do you think of it?
singapore,3cv63f,dnyy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:52:35 2015 UTC,"Much more decisive than me :)  I had the chance to U-turn before graduation and after during job search too but I said no.  I am considering graduate programs in computing in general, not sure if it's going to be exactly MS in CS, though that is high in my considerations. In fact I was just discussing with my manager about it yesterday.  Cons is a weird thing to put on an academic credential. Probably by large it would be the non-trivial commitment, and then cost (if the school is really good)."
singapore,3cv63f,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz,2,Sat Jul 11 11:36:46 2015 UTC,"Cons also because some people in our industry believe that portfolio and experience count much more than a CS MS.   Considering that a part time MS course is not a trivial project with the amount of time needed for it, some may choose to invest that resource into a more specific area of their career. I can understand why.  It would be interesting to meet you up to discuss more! I haven't had that many friends in this industry. Let me know if you are interested!"
singapore,3cv63f,dnyy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:16:27 2015 UTC,"Well, there's that way of looking at things, because those people definitely exist. I would say that point of view (MS CS is low value add) works much more strongly for someone who already has a Bachelor's in CS. I don't think it would hurt much (or at all) for someone who was from a completely unrelated field. It's not like you would have absolutely zero experience and portfolio if you attended a MS programme. Besides, it could signal commitment to the field if you attended a rigorous programme to patch any deficiency in fundamentals you might have.    If going the projects/portfolio route you should be prepared to think deeply about architecture and technology utilized in them, deeply enough to defend your choices and in general talk intelligently about the projects. It should also either solve an interesting problem or solve something in an interesting way. That would give you something to talk about.  Either way you choose it wouldn't be the wrong way, it would just be your preferred way. And if someone (potential employer?) says otherwise, then it's just a bad fit anyway. No loss there.   Of course if you have some precise preferred state you really want to end up in, then you should find out exactly what is it going to take to get you there. Going on alternative paths would make it a lot harder."

singapore,3cv63f,notyoursoulsister,3,Sat Jul 11 08:19:38 2015 UTC,The PEB considers the 4-year engineering degrees here from NTU and NUS as equivalent to a UK Masters in Engineering.   It's the same reason why a graduate from a Masters in Engineering from NUS/NTU wear the exact same gown/hood colours as their honours degree counterparts. Because they are considered as equivalent to each other.
singapore,3cv63f,Wheat-gen-stein,3,Sat Jul 11 08:55:48 2015 UTC,"Civil engineering is actually a very broad engineering degree. We deal with structures (bridges, foundations, essentially buildings), fluid mechanics (pipes, fluid flow, think of PUB), geomatics (soils, rocks etc). I just completed my year 1 so this is my limited knowledge. IMO, like what /u/wheat-gen-stein says, a 4 year masters from UK is completely equivalent to 4 years bachelors from Singapore. Other than the obvious Imperial or MIT etc university, it is not essential to go overseas. I am of the opinion that in a technical degree like this, obvious a 4 year bachelor (Singapore) is better than a 3 year bachelor (UK).   Note : I'm a little biased cause UCL's civil engineering is a little of a mess and sometimes I regret coming here for it. Must as well stay in Singapore where I can eat my hokkien mee every day."
singapore,3cv63f,charbby,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:19:30 2015 UTC,"Oh man, you really lost out. The curriculum here in NTU engineering is really very well structured. In terms of both within modules themselves and also the entire course as a whole. Its like a nicely structured MMORPG job tree.  But UCL itself is a great school! However, in terms of civil engineering, both NUS and NTU are ranked way higher than UCL. Engineering seems to be our forte here. In terms of humanities/social sciences, overseas would be a much better option."

singapore,3cv63f,notyoursoulsister,0,Sat Jul 11 08:15:13 2015 UTC,"TL; DR. Go for passion. No passion, keep an open mind.   Like what other redditors said, loving that subject will make your life better. But not because you won't feel pain studying/working. Its because you more willing to sacrifice other commitments and are better able to innovate when others do not.   Its not unheard of to get first class honours without a drop of passion.  If you don't have passion. First and foremost is to have an open mind. This is hard. I'm not sure why you limit to 3 engineering disciplines. Find out more from various veterans. Go ask /u/zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz. Ask the good times and bad times, ask working hours, ask why he change and what happened to those who stay.   I have seen many of my friends who is just working at a job.

The bureaucracy in the SAF can sometimes be of an advantage.   By right, you have to go through PES A/B BMT if you up-pes. But lots of units dont keep track of who downpes and up-pes every single time. So you might go unnoticed.

singapore,3cropd,Syptryn,4,Fri Jul 10 09:51:31 2015 UTC,"If everyone in the world lived packed close in to each other, resource distribution would become far easier. Also, densely packed cities are far, far greener on a per capita basis than rural areas, so having as many people packed together as possible would probably be much better for our environment than our current situation. The reason Singapore produces so much waste is because its people are used to using a lot of energy and all kinds of material shit, and that isn't a problem that would be exacerbated by having people live closer to each other."
singapore,3cropd,myepicdemise,4,Fri Jul 10 10:32:29 2015 UTC,"If everyone in the world lived packed close in to each other, resource distribution would become far easier.   The govt, bureaucracy and people themselves have more to do with that than the population density. A badly managed city is hell on earth simply because so much can go wrong. I'd rather live by myself in a Borneo jungle than in Karachi.    Also, densely packed cities are far, far greener on a per capita basis than rural areas   I know, I was talking about the effect 10s of Billions of extra people will have on the total production.    The reason Singapore produces so much waste   ... is that its a successful city. Such behaviour is a hallmark of all rich, urban societies. That was my point. The sad reality is the world can't handle everyone being rich consumers.   And apart from all this you have remember that people aren't Sims. They won't do things just because someone shows them some figures and says its more efficient for the entire planet. Everyone wants creature comforts and for a vast majority of people everywhere (who have a choice in these things), living a 3 bedroom room flat in a high rise is very far from it. There's a reason such living conditions are mostly only seen in Asian cities where we have too many people and not enough land."

So the new fine will bite hard, but it's not as financially crippling as the bottom line for their bus operations.  The bombshell will be the govt giving them more public funds to upgrade the whole infrastructure (something which I think is inevitable), like how it paid for new public buses to help out the bus operators a couple years ago.

I think it's a cool concept, and it certainly looks flashy and fun- but I have a problem with how they dress this up as being practical fight training.  Some snippets from their videos and website:   All our sessions are based on actual martial arts.   When it comes to saber dueling, we believe in teaching you REAL skills that can be used in REAL life or self defense situations. We don't believe in fictional styles or make-believe combat. Why spend time learning something that does not help you in any way?  You get to keep FIT, have FUN and all the SKILLS you learn can be used in self defense situations in REAL LIFE.  The primary source of technical and tactical proficiency of the Combat Saber System comes from Tuhon Tim Waid of PTKGO.   Based on the videos, this is anything BUT practical. Running at your opponent while twirling your weapon around? Turning your back on your opponent? Kicking off the wall to strike from mid-air? Yeah, that's how you die in a real sword fight.  take this video for example. This guy is being taught how to swing his sword in a complete arc over his opponent's head. Great if you want to give your opponent a haircut, horrible if you want to not die.  ""Why can't you just leave them be, though? Let them have their fun, they're not hurting anyone!"" Wrong! They're telling people that they are learning something that's practical in a real self defense situation, when the skills they are learning are probably more useful at a rave party.   They are basically misinforming the participants, which is terrible and irresponsible. They are giving them a false sense of security, and a baseless sense of self confidence in armed combat. A person who would have otherwise fled in a street fight might instead choose to stand his ground, thinking that his hours of training has made him a master, when he's actually in for a butt whooping, or worse.  tl;dr: Lightsaber battles are designed to look cool, and if you are going to take that and turn it into a fighting style, you're going to get the most impractical fighting style on the planet. If you want to play Jedi every Sunday that's great, but please don't even try to pass this off as practical."

singapore,3cs8s0,rindojustrindo,12,Fri Jul 10 10:38:42 2015 UTC,"Singapore has the company/regional headquarters of so many banks and corporations. We also field a lot of R & D. This is through a combination of low corporate taxes, low income taxes,  low GST, an efficient administration, English as an official language, which makes Singapore one of the few cities in the region that expats are happy to live in long term (i.e., with their families). These beneficial policies ensure that it is viable for companies to build their research/administrative centers in Singapore, which in turn ensure that Singaporeans have much better job prospects than their neighbors.   In addition, Singaporean universities pull far above their weight with respect to Singapore population. Despite having a population of only around 4 million, Singapore has two Universities in the World Top 50. For comparison, a similarly developed country of similar size (New Zealand), can barely squeeze it top Uni above the Top 100.

Transfer pricing, is the name given to the practice of companies setting up shell companies in low-tax countries that hold their parent company's critical patents/assets, often ""purchased"" for a low price, whereupon huge fees are charged for use of the patent/assets.  E.g. Coke Inc. is in the USA, with a 35% corporate income tax (IIRC). Their net revenue is say, 10 billion dollars. So they have to pay 3.5 billion to the US government. So, the people at Coke Inc. set up a new company in the Cayman Islands (or maybe just Delaware), Coke-Coka Inc., and sell Coke's recipe to them for $1. Then, Coke-Coka Inc. turns around and charges Coke Inc. $3 billion to use their intellectual property (the recipe). So now Coke Inc.'s net revenue is now ""only"" $500 million, and they pay just $175 million in tax instead of $3.5 billion (plus whatever the tax rate is in their chosen tax haven, which can well be 0%).  Do note the example I gave wouldn't actually work under current laws and is extremely simplified, but it serves to explain the concept."

Thus, non-bumiputra have to either buy the license from them or set up business overseas?  Ignoring this seems to be huge oversight imho."

singapore,3cvnad,malaysianlah,6,Sat Jul 11 09:24:22 2015 UTC,"Well, that doesn't answer anything.  If Malaysia has no competitive advantage... why set up shop there?  Tax can't be the ONLY reason businesses are having shell companies in Singapore right? Bumiputra policy, rampant corruption, business unfriendly regulations, I could name a whole lot more reasons why I'd avoid the heck out of Malaysia if I wanted to set up a business as a Chinese Malaysian. Could you name me some reasons why I should set up shop in Malaysia instead?  You can blame Singapore what has Malaysia to offer?"
singapore,3cvnad,dashrandom,-11,Sat Jul 11 09:32:08 2015 UTC,"No. What I witnessed was malaysian companies, having running businesses in malaysia that shudve paid malaysian taxes instead pay dummy royalties to a singapore shell company to pay a low tax rate, when their business is almost entirely conducted in malaysia.   Thats what I find terrible."
singapore,3cvnad,malaysianlah,9,Sat Jul 11 09:35:49 2015 UTC,"You are once again not answering my question.    Is tax the only reason to do this?  Could bumiputra policy and the inability to obtain a license to register a sdn bhd business have been the cause for setting up the shell pte ltd company in Singapore to conduct business in Malaysia?  Could it be that locals companies are more subject to being asked for coffee money vs a Singaporean company?  Or are there 2 registered entities, one in SG and one in Malaysia?   Stop avoiding the questions. This is the 3rd time I'm SPECIFICALLY asking about bumiputra policy and you're ignoring it. If you are wrong and don't want to reply and make yourself look bad, then don't reply. Don't reply and then ignore the question."
singapore,3cvnad,dashrandom,-12,Sat Jul 11 09:44:12 2015 UTC,"No. Its 2 companies. A sdn bhd with a pte ltd as its holdings.  Bumiputera policies are not the issue because business licenses wont matter if u do ur business  in malaysia regardless of ur a pte ltd or sdn bhd. At the sme level the 30pc rule does not apply, as it only applies at the public limiyed liabilities and certain businesses (which if ur a pte ltd u wont get to conduct in malaysia anyway)  Coffee money will be asked either way as well. So u dont get special treatment, especially when they know the ultimate business owner is malaysian.   Tax appears to be the main reason."

singapore,3cs0b6,Erique,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:54:25 2015 UTC,"Doesn't ""living off the earnings of a sex worker"" mean the photographer has to actively collude with his clients in getting THEIR clientele?

However, I do see my dad getting really good deals when purchasing stuff there. Then again, he's been shopping there for 20 years + and has a bit of a silver tongue, so YMMV.  For fruits and meat, I usually get them at Giant.  I tend to notice Giant selling their older fruits on sale with really low prices (eg, $2.20 for 400g of grapes), which is good for me, seeing I usually finish them on the day itself.  As for meat, imo they have the cheapest beef and lamb amongst the supermarkets, iirc, 300g of lamb shoulder blade only cost about $4.90.  I usually get my chicken and fish at Sheng Shiong.  3 big ass drumsticks at only $2. 1kg of frozen fish around $4-$8 (depending on the type of fish).  Tend to get my veggies here as well, noticed that SS carries more variety of veggies then Giant.    Cold Storage tend to be more expensive, but carry stuff that the others often don't have (eg, Lindt's 90% dark chocolate).  As for NTUC Fairprice, imo, I dislike shopping at standard Fairprice the most.  The prices are cheap for in-house goods and daily items like sugar or cooking oil, but slightly more expensive for meat and as I tend to eat a paleo'ish diet, this is a no go.  Also the Fairprice near my place is ALWAYS crowded like phuck.  NTUC Xtra and Finest are great tho.  Just a 2 cents from a dude who cooks his own meals and don't really care about quality, as long as its palatable and healthy :)"

singapore,3cs5i2,redcountrybear,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:24:21 2015 UTC,"I hear ya.  I couldn't stay on true paleo or keto as well.  I don't call my current ""diet"" a diet, just a lifestyle change. In a week, I just eat healthier food 70% of the time and leave the remaining 30% for whatever I desire.  On a strict keto diet, I lasted 2 months, 3 for paleo but for this change, it has already been a year.  I have lost a good amount of fats and generally feel energetic and good each day.  So while the way I eat isn't fully paleo, I personally consider it ""paleo'ish"", because I subscribe to what paleo believes is a healthy diet - just that I don't really have the willpower and fortitude to eat a pure paleo diet 100% of the time.  What's important imo is that its sustainable and has been working great for me so far :)"
singapore,3cs5i2,blahhh87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:41:31 2015 UTC,"what's the difference between paleo & keto, if you dont mind my asking? :)"
singapore,3cs5i2,AsksIfYouAreATree,2,Fri Jul 10 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"Alright here's my understanding.  Keto = low carb, high fat.  Low carb is defined as around 20g of carb per day (depends on individuals), mainly from vegetables.  This is to get into a state called ""ketosis"" where your body uses fat for energy, rather then carbs or glucose.    Paleo = Caveman diet.  Eating natural, wholesome food that our ancestors ate in the paleozoic era.  I interpret it as eating food grown in nature that doesn't come in a packaging/made in a factory, processed or have ingredients which I can't pronounce.  So looking at a potato, a keto guy will scoff at it while the paleo dude will embrace it.  On the other hand, the keto guy will embrace cheese while the paleo dude will not touch it.  Experiences with keto = Effective like phuck for losing fats if you keep to the 20g carb limit.  Fats are very filling and without even counting calories, I only ate 1500-1700 cals a day and still felt full.  You can go nuts on food like cream, cheese coconut milk and fried chicken skin.  However, I really find it hard to stay away from carbs (potatoes being one of my fav food), usually fall off the wagon on the 1 or 2 months mark.  This happened a few times before I decided that keto isn't for me.  Experiences with paleo = Not as effective as keto for losing fats IMO, but still feel energised and good throughout the day. I was able to stick with paleo for a longer period of time, but fall off the wagon now and then.  Eventually, I realized that a strict diet isn't for me, so I adopted a semi-paleo way of eating for almost a year plus and it gave me good results - am in my late 20s and am in better shape then I was in NS.  There are some people who adopted the keto-paleo way of life (eat only natural low carb food) and I admire their discipline.  For more info, head on /r/keto and /r/paleo."

singapore,3cs8io,alexong5011,5,Fri Jul 10 14:01:20 2015 UTC,"My top food options / 'go-to food' in hawker centres for 'clean eating', with meat for protein, some carbs & low fat. These are pretty common so there shouldn't be an issue finding them anywhere :  1) Steamed Chicken / Duck Rice, swap the flavored rice for white rice, no oil no sauce. I also remove the skin before eating.   2) Grilled Western food like chicken chop or baked fish, no fries & no sauce & no coleslaw. I usually swap my fries for steam vegetables, if not then maybe fried egg (I don't think fried egg is that bad if eaten in moderation or under your macros if you're into bodybuilding etc).   3) Soup based dish such as fish soup with tofu, or beef soup.   Some people are worried about sodium intake, but I don't think its a cause for worry as long you keep yourself well-hydrated & do cardio to sweat it out.   One key reason why hawker food can be labelled 'unhealthy' is coz of high-carb, high-fat local food such as char kway teow (fried noodles w/o meat), roti prata (flour) & laska (soup noodles with minimal amount of meat). So just steer clear for those, reduce / cut off sauces from rice-based dishes that have sufficient meat and it should be healthy enough"
singapore,3cs8io,mminsy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:19:02 2015 UTC,"Very informative! I think most of us being Asians are use to having rice as a main component of our diet, if not full enough just add another bowl of rice.

singapore,3cs8io,redryder74,5,Sat Jul 11 04:34:45 2015 UTC,People generally say no because the healthy options (like yong tau foo without the processed stuff) are very much in the minority.

Yong tau foo soup without any deep fried stuff and lots of veg, Hakka thunder tea with brown rice, and Cai Png stall order only veg with no rice.    Yes, I've gone vegetarian for four months now and have lost about 10kg. I usually bring cooked brown or black rice from home and eat that with the yong tau foo or Cai png dishes. The black rice especially takes a long time to digest so I can eat less without feeling hungry.   At home I may eat a salad for dinner or just Chinese cooked vegetables.   Occasionally I allow an indulgence and eat some meat or noodle dishes. I still enjoy wanton mee."

singapore,3crnlc,Acataeono,8,Fri Jul 10 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"Its a seasonal thing, so getting together to eat it is a cultural/social thing that has developed over the years. While durian isn't particularly seasonal anymore, the tradition still stands. I believe the durian parties/gatherings are just regaining more limelight due to the news of durians becoming supposedly cheaper.  It's just another way to chill with friends and family."
singapore,3crnlc,pandasforkarma,6,Fri Jul 10 05:47:44 2015 UTC,"Ok I have a theory, and please tell me if I'm wrong, which I very possibly could be.   For a country as small as Singapore and only 50 years old, there's not much solid items of culture to look forward to. Especially because it's an amalgamation of other cultures like Chinese, Malay and Indian heritage. Other than the practices belonging to those races, there's not much physical things Singapore can attribute it's original culture to. And that's why we cling to the things we can define as Singaporean.   There's nothing wrong about it, it just happens to be that way."

When I was a kid, my late grandpa & granduncle would drive out to the plantations in Sarimbun (or Johor) to buy a wicket basket's worth & then distribute the fruits to our families as well as their carpentry workers.

singapore,3csgxh,Karma_Turret,2,Fri Jul 10 12:14:26 2015 UTC,"Hi,  DPA student here.    Do research on topics that hover around your course of study (For example,  if you are going for a DPA interview in aerospace engineering, be prepared to be asked questions like your future career aspirations in the aerospace industry, and also questions related to the course of study such as the materials used in aircraft construction etc.  I'm not sure what business/humanities/life science/IT DPA students get asked though.)  They might also ask about your mid year or prelim results. Questions may range from why your English grade is not that good, why you are applying for a life science course (example)  when your chemistry results aren't good.  They will also ask what measure are you going to take to improve your results.  Of course,  if you have maintained stellar academic results consistently then questions regarding your results shouldn't pose that much of a problem to you.    Oh yeah,  the projects/competitions that you have done that is related.  They will ask about it.    I can't really remember any other details of the interview as I had it almost 4 years ago.  Most importantly,  don't be too nervous,  and be confident about yourself! All the best for your DPA interview :).   If you have any questions regarding the preparatory programme or anything else related to DPA feel free to ask me."

Show them that you would really like the course and show/imply that you are committed to spending 3 years in the course without dropping out/messing around.  DPA is limited in slots, so it helps to let them know that you won't do a last minute pull out at any moment, should you get approved.   If you don't get the approved, but have other similar course interviews after this, and manage to impress the interviewer enough, it miiight be ok to go out with a limb as politely tell them that you have another similar course and ask them for a recommendation letter to that course.  Only if it's similar and in the same school! I can't guarantee anything, and to only try it if you're brave enough, but having a recommendation letter penned by a teacher from the school itself can be your biggest asset.

You will be dispatched to your unit to wait to be sent on class 3/4 course. The wait can be a few weeks to a few months long. During this time you will probably do sai kang like washing vehicle etc.    When you do get sent on class 3/4 course, it will be at Kaki Bukit camp. Here you will be driving manual vehicles. Class 3 is land rover, and is probably the shittiest, and oldest of vehicles to have roamed the roads of Singapore. Class 4 is 3 tonner. Your first lesson on that will be terrifying simply because of the size difference.    This phase will take 2-3 months. There will be a test at the end, on the 3 tonner, which you MUST pass to continue. Or else you will OOC and be posted somewhere else probably.    Note that neither the 3 tonner nor the land rover are used any unit in ops. Why we still have to learn? Because fuckin SAF said so.    Your next phase will be at Kranji or Mandai camp. This will be approximately 18 days of familiarization with 5 tonner and OU, both auto vehicles.    Everyone else thinks that drivers damn slack, damn easy. But it really ain't so. Especially when we get fucked daily by driving instructors, screaming at us inside the confines of the vehicle. It can get nerve wrecking at times. But once you get the license and move on to auto vehicles, life gets better.    Feel free to PM me for more info. After all, drivers damn fucking slack /s"

There are legit brothels in Geylang for locals. From what I've heard they don't entertain foreigners because some foreigners just want to look rather than buy the services (""I want some hip edgy black and white photos of trafficked women for my instagram!""). Geylang is basically the red light area for locals. There are street walkers there too, though that's illegal. Most of the prostitutes in Singapore are from Vietnam, Thailand etc and are here illegally, so the brothels might be legal but the women working in them aren't.  The ""four floors of whores"" Orchard Towers is a shopping mall with a lot of bars in it which are full of hookers. This is where expat men go. If you want to feel your skin crawl, go for a couple drinks there and people watch. The prostitution in four floors is illegal but the govt turns a blind eye.  There are other places to go, but Geylang and the Four Floors are the ones everyone knows.  One tip a friend gave me years ago is never to be openly judgemental about men who use prostitues or have affairs here, because it's so widespread that you might offend someone if you criticize it."

singapore,3crtgk,Phlork,2,Fri Jul 10 06:52:10 2015 UTC,"Hmm, just wondering, what brand of beer are you planning to send over? Craft beer imports to Singapore are pretty vibrant, and German commercial beer is sometimes lumped into that category. If the beer is available here, you might be able to order it from a Singaporean site and save on shipping and any possible tax.   About your questions, I'm not sure about the declaration, but I've ordered beer from Denmark before and even though it wasn't marked on the shipping label, Customs here in Singapore was able to pick up that it was alcohol I was getting shipped into the country. I had to go to the Customs' office to pay for the alcohol tax in order to eventually pick up my package. It was a pretty seamless process, but still a bit of a pain as they only operated 9am to 5pm on weekdays, so I had to get up early on a Saturday morning to pick up my loot."
singapore,3crtgk,mrmeowman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:16:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm, the recipient having to pay is kinda taking the fun out of sending a present. What sum are we talking about? I googled a lot, but all I could find was that it does cost something, not how much it actually costs. Is there any way for me to spare her the hassle of paying duty and collecting the package? Can I somehow pay it upfront? Or are there maybe even exceptions for small amounts declared as a gift?"
singapore,3crtgk,mrmeowman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:36:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, exactly. There is a calculation. Something like $80[alcohol percentage eg][volume in litres]. My American beers didn't have a percentage printed on the bottle so the guy just took 5%.   I don't think there's a way to pay this upfront, and I don't think there are exceptions, unless customs somehow didn't manage to pick up that you're sending bottles. I only bought two and they picked it up.   Again, what beer are you hoping to send her? Because you never know, it's available here. And if it is, I don't mind even helping you bring it to her or mail it to her if you're afraid the former's too creepy."
singapore,3crtgk,Nikuhiru,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:13:32 2015 UTC,Customs regulation: you will need to declare the contents. Your postal office in Germany may not ship alcohol.

They have been paying out pretty good rates compared to Singapore so I'm not sure if Singapore's rates look as fine when compared to theirs at face value. Perhaps someone can explain whether CPF performs better than EPF.  You're right that CPF return rate is similar to SGS 10-year bond yields which is averaging 2.6 now. Except that you have the power to decide which bonds to buy and how long you want them to be. But you don't have the same freedom nor right with CPF.

singapore,3cpsj1,very_fierce,3,Fri Jul 10 03:39:34 2015 UTC,Most pension or provident funds invest in govt bonds and generally this forms the floor of the returns that they get. Epf for example has abt 300b in malaysian govt debt which pays abt 4% interest.. so from there alone they shud be able to raise 4% in returns.  Given that singaporea debt is only paying interest at abt 1 to 2% naturally this has a consequent impact on the returns the cpf will generate...

It might be a hack (lots of those going around nowadays), or it might be just good old-fashioned politically-unaccountable defects.  source: 35+ years as a software developer, at least a third of which was working with security-oriented systems."
singapore,3cra3j,StopAt2,8,Fri Jul 10 03:28:29 2015 UTC,"This article misses a key point. The F-35 isn't an air superiority fighter, that's what the F-22 is for. In modern air combat you use a radar plane like an AWACS to spot the targets and communicate them to the fighters who shoot them down from a very long distance. If the F-35 is getting in dogfights, its already being used incorrectly.   I'm not saying the F-35 program isn't a mess, it is. But at least criticize the right things."
singapore,3cra3j,dreadpiratewombat,8,Fri Jul 10 03:42:12 2015 UTC,"There are some issues with this.   First, we have to look at how the F-35’s sensors compare to its rivals. The latest Russian radars, such as the one on the new Sukhoi Su-35, at least match the JSF’s APG-81, according to data compiled by Carlo Kopp at Air Power Australia.   Kopp is highly biased, to put it mildly. He thinks that Australia should have bought the F-22, and skews statistics to make everything else seem awful (by applying complex analyses to US systems while taking manufacturer claims verbatim for Russian ones). I would cite the line in the article linked, but that one doesn't even mention the AN/APG-81, only the AN/APG-77.   But take a look at the F-35’s engine nozzle. It’s round. Highly stealthy planes such as America’s B-2 bomber and F-22 fighter both boast flat engine nozzles that spread out their exhaust plumes, cutting back on the telltale IR signature.   As demonstrated by LOAN, this is false. You can get substantial IR signature reductions from a circular nozzle. The F-22 has them because it uses thrust vectoring.   “You can’t stealthify against long-wavelength radars,” says Pierre Sprey, an experienced engineer who worked on both the F-16 and the A-10 ground attack plane.   Sprey is not a reliable source - and moreover, is wrong. You can reduce RCS against long wave radars, in one of two ways: use large shapes (B-2, not possible in F-35 or F-22 scale), or use RAM or other materials measures to absorb incoming longwave radiation. The F-35 uses the latter techniques, so while it's not as tiny as it is in the short wavelengths, it's smaller than the alternative.   These giant arrays can detect tiny objects at great distances. Tehran insists its Ghadir radar can spot jets more than 300 miles away. Russian arms-dealer Rosoboronexport claims the Rezonans-NE can detect stealth planes nearly 750 miles distant.   Remember what I was saying about buying manufacturer claims verbatim? There's a lot to radar detection, none of which these numbers account for.   The American AIM-120, the Russian R-77 and the Chinese PL-12 are all comparable long-range missiles, each with a nominal range of around 60 miles. But the F-35 is slower than rival Russian or Chinese fighters, making it a less effective missile-shooter.   No - this is only true at the most superficial level. Yes, the AIM-120A has the same range as the R-77 and the PL-12, but the AIM-120D has a much longer range (140km). Also, R-77 has really substantial production issues.   Not that the F-35 has much room for different kinds of missiles. In stealth mode, with its weapons tucked into an internal bay, the F-35 can only carry four AIM-120s. And that’s only if it’s not also carrying its standard load of GPS-guided bombs.   6 in 2020.   The Chinese J-20 apparently has room for four missiles inside its main weapons bay, along with two more missiles in smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage. The more conventional Su-35 can carry a whopping 10 missiles under its wings and fuselage.   Which says a lot about the reliability of the missiles. The F-35 and J-20 both carry 6 missiles - so why the extra?"

singapore,3cra3j,NEWater,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:40:15 2015 UTC,"My bad. Rafale.  Honestly, the fuss about stealth is superfluous. I know folks at RAND and elsewhere in Washington who reckon Russian equipment bought by China can easily defeat that stealth anyway. Also, scramjet missiles are probably going to replace the F35's stealth in defeating Chinese A2/AD."
singapore,3cra3j,ckfinite,3,Fri Jul 10 05:43:38 2015 UTC,"I know folks at RAND and elsewhere in Washington who reckon Russian equipment bought by China can easily defeat that stealth anyway.   And they're wrong. VHF band radars can't defeat stealth, not entirely. While they're more effective against it, stealth aircraft include features to reduce longwave RCS, reducing detection range. Furthermore, these radars are highly inaccurate (due to physics), and are large and slow to move (also thanks to physics). You'll never guide a missile with one.  VHF reduces the effectiveness of stealth, but doesn't eliminate it. A VHF radar will detect a LO aircraft at a much shorter distance than a normal one."
singapore,3cra3j,NEWater,0,Fri Jul 10 05:48:36 2015 UTC,"It's not the radar signature, but the F35 airframe which burns so hot at lower altitudes, even old systems like the BuK could find it.  The F35 is a money sinkhole which will probably never yield anything of use in the 21st century, and the USAF knows it."
singapore,3cra3j,ckfinite,3,Fri Jul 10 05:53:45 2015 UTC,"It's not the radar signature, but the F35 airframe which burns so hot at lower altitudes, even old systems like the BuK could find it.   The F-35 has a lot of thermal mitigation systems on it - it was one of the hardest things about the design, apparently, and was the reason for the fuel temperature limits that were in the news some time ago. What's more, the Buk series doesn't have an IR sensor (too old). The targeting camera in that uses visual light only (and monochrome, at that).  Furthermore, IR and visible light based sensors are very limited in terms of range. Yes, lots of systems can detect it, but it requires the aircraft to approach near the sensor in order to do so. The very best sensors can detect it 45-60km away - and range drops exponentially from there."

singapore,3cre2y,Wheat-gen-stein,2,Fri Jul 10 04:23:54 2015 UTC,"Let me just say this here. Although animals are more 'responsive' to sensory datum, that does not mean vegetables/plants do not react and do not 'feel' either. In fact, plants do react to being harmed all the time. Albeit at a slower rate than animals.   For example, if anyone remembers last year, after a long dry spell, trees reacted by blooming quickly and in large numbers in order to reproduce because the trees' survival was threatened. Source: http://mothership.sg/2014/04/crazy-weather-patterns-in-spore-causing-unusual-mass-blooming-of-flowers/  So even plants do know when they are being threatened or harmed. Should we stop eating vegetables too then?  And the vegan argument from suffering is flawed. If animals should be free from suffering, shouldn't we ensure that carnivorous wild animals don't eat other animals too? Why is it that its okay if a cow is mauled to death by lions but not okay if its eaten by humans? To the cow, what's the difference? If you retort by saying that 'lions are part of nature' then guess what buddy, so are humans. We evolved together with the other species on this planet."

Fear of being insulted for trying to do what reddit was intended for. This will lead to an overall lesser content for the community and thus making this sub reddit that much worse."

singapore,3cre2y,dashrandom,-2,Fri Jul 10 08:18:04 2015 UTC,if you dont want people to share stuff they found interesting and relevant to the subreddit   It's not interesting and it's not relevant. It's controversial. There's a difference.    It's people like you and comments like yours that negatively affect the community and the content that is being shared here.    Yeah I'm pretty sure about that. Maybe I should stop and be a lurker and this place will be more fantastic /s

Another thing is that if you think this is worth sharing, then so be it.

Although from my work experience (in SMEs), it seems like local employers have no bias? My colleagues were from overseas Us but they're Singaporeans. My dad is a CEO of an SME and he also doesn't care about which U. IN fact, his hiring decision is based on 1) past work experience, 2) interview performance, 3) EQ of the candidate & the willingness to work hard & learn - this one is super important.

QS is doesn't rank school by their quality if I remember, only research stuff is ranked. This means it's more applicable to post grads.   Either way, it depends on what you are doing. If you took finance from NTU and I had it SIM with a CFA then the game changes. Assuming we both have MBA then the HR pretty much looks at the MBA only. Degrees right now is pretty much like water. Since our man power so tight I feel like we are competing SG vs FT. So an overseas cert might not be too bad."

singapore,3cnnmg,cutifiedwaffles,13,Thu Jul 9 08:52:34 2015 UTC,"There are generally 3 levels of probation. I will just leave what i know here, correct me if im wrong.  Level 1: Guidance Program(Below 18)  You will not be reporting to any police officers or whatsoever directly. But you will be reporting to social workers. The program includes a curfew, and 8 individual counselling session with 2 or 4 counselling with parents. (sorry if amount is wrong, its been long since i got out of this shit) Then there will group activities with the other people who got into this program during your school holidays every week. everything is a must to attend, no excuses. Some fun is still there in all these.  Level 2 : Probabtion  You will be receiving calls at the stipulated timing of your curfew every night. sometimes its a voice recognition system, sometimes its your officer. They just want to know you are home. Then some times inbetween they will do random spot checks and call to see if you left house after listening to their call. You need to report back forthnightly or monthly (?) back to your officer. There will most likely be Corrective Work Order and if you do well, you might be let go one or two weeks earlier. All depends on officer, be nice to him/her.  Level 3 : Tagging  The famous rolex on the leg. You get the tracker, they fix triggers at your doorsteps. You are not home by curfew? They know. You are standing near your door during curfew? They know. Your leg cant leave the door during the curfew. And you cant cut the tracker too cause instantly police will be at your house door. And you still have to do call, reporting and CWO same as Level 2.  Thatz all folkz"

singapore,3cnnmg,meep_feep,3,Thu Jul 9 09:32:39 2015 UTC,"It's a bit of a hassle, but most people can continue with their daily life (school/work/etc) throughout the sentence.   They'll have to report to your probation officer every day, and he/she (usually a counsellor) will speak to the parents at least once a week to report on progress.  The officer will usually also 'recommend' programs like community service or rehabilitation courses for the juvenile (basically counselling sessions).  If the juvenile doesn't report without a valid reason, a warning will be given. Repeated warnings will end up in an a breach of the court order.  Breaching the probation order can force the court to extend the duration of the order or even punish the juvenile with the full sentence instead.

singapore,3ciw2o,alvingn,12,Wed Jul 8 09:13:48 2015 UTC,"and for your next breakfast, try kaya butter toast with half-boiled eggs. kaya is a coconut-egg spread. coupled with butter and served on toast. To feast, firstly crack open the half boiled eggs and pour out into the provided saucer. Add pepper and dark soy sauce to preference and mix everything up (dont be afraid to break the yolk..). Dip the toast into the egg and gobble everything down! my canadian friend was doubtful of eating like this at first, but first mouth and she was a convert!  another thing is Bak Kwa. not so much a main meal, but more of a snack. this is a staple during Chinese new year, but is also available all year round. same said canadian friend calls it ""Candied Bacon Jerky"", so you can imagine how it tastes.. :)"

singapore,3co0q0,malaysianlah,2,Thu Jul 9 11:52:15 2015 UTC,"Well. If you bought 1 stock for $100, and the stock rises to $200, you, in fact have $200 and a 100% TSR. Your concern, I'm guessing, it's between realised and unrealised profit. So yes, you do have that $200 on paper, but not as cash or something you can use, but that stock is still worth $200 dollars and you did make a profit.  Using this link, the Change in Net Portfolio Value, Starring Net Portfolio Value and Dividend Income should be used to calculate, which I assumed you used to get your value. So (266-223)/223 = 19.3%?"
singapore,3co0q0,MehMehEatGrass,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:58:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but considering that the fund did receive a capital injection of $18b, using ending Net port value over beginning port value doesn't seem right..  And in the financial highlights, returns on assets and equity is only about 5%, 7% respectively, i'm not sure what is uplifting the TSR to 19.2% from an RoE of 7%"
singapore,3co0q0,MehMehEatGrass,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:27:51 2015 UTC,"Well that's the definition of TSR. Like how for ROA and ROE are strictly defined as well, nothing really you can do about it.   But in the end, this exercise is actually good. Temasek claims such a high TSR because it sounds impressive, to make themselves look good. To know truly how well a fund is doing, TSR is not sufficient, other indicators, like you've mentioned above must be taken into account as well.   In conclusion, no there is nothing wrong with the calculation of the TSR, but it should not be used as the only benchmark."
singapore,3co0q0,greenteaapple,2,Fri Jul 10 01:42:33 2015 UTC,"Haven't looked at all your links, but this says capital injections from shareholder are excluded:   Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is a compounded and annualised measure, which includes dividends paid to our shareholder and excludes capital injections from our shareholder. As a long term investor, we track our TSR over various time periods."

singapore,3ck6pe,dashrandom,4,Thu Jul 9 02:16:51 2015 UTC,"Precisely. And even if you took a right route, passenger might claim the other way. Eg I took customers requested route which wasn't the best, after which he was stuck in jam and he lodged a report. Fare was discounted and taken out from my fare.   All these issues and lack of support makes it difficult to view ourself as partners with uber. Also, the various incentives are quite bullshit and I have to keep reminding old drivers to sign up for incentives weekly else they wouldnt be eligible. The structure is also confusing leading to many older drivers miss out getting the perks as they didn't understand the many conditions they have to satisfy.   On the other hand, I've taken quite a few Grab car employees and the all expressed genuine concern to both drivers and passengers constantly tweaking stuff to make it better for everyone.   It's not surprising since there is an actual office with brains working on our transport office, as compared to uber throwing everything to offshore outsourcing with zero local knowledge, that both passengers and drivers have been flocking from Uber to grab.

All messages are on the cloud, so once you sign in (on phone or any device), you will see all previous messages/pics/docs. Never worry about losing your conversations again! No need to backup!

singapore,3cja2p,mrkiasume,6,Wed Jul 8 11:11:18 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone so negative ah. I think it's good that the PM is even commenting on this even though he's busy with many other issues internationally (technically this is not really his area of expertise, but Tuck Yew's); would everyone rather the PM not comment and share his ""concerns"" on this at all? PM show concern alr means he is keeping his eyes on Tuck Yew he'll have to step up his game or face the consequences. I'm really hoping after the great SMRT meltdown they will sit down and implement changes for improvement. It's too early to tell but at least have hope lah."
singapore,3cja2p,ImInUranus,2,Wed Jul 8 16:46:38 2015 UTC,"To put it in the context of a MRT system that has been reliable until 2011 (first major breakdown), there's reason for all of us to be negative. We have been sold to the fact that our MRT system is impeccable, and recent years have shown otherwise. To fuel the unhappiness, posters trumpeting the improvements (more trains, better signaling, etc.) are now becoming practical jokes because the system isn't what it was. It's more of ministers and the SMRT management dropping soundbites than genuinely wanting to get to the root of the problem.  The root of the problem is they don't even understand the root of the problem. Management is still playing guessing games."
singapore,3cja2p,tsukuruu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:03:53 2015 UTC,"to be honest, things even now works pretty well - which is precisely why when once in a blue moon there is a breakdown, it stands out so glaringly. Of-course there is room for improvement, both to reduce such incidents, as well as response time to such incidents, but MRT in SG is probably run better than anywhere else in the world even now ... and there may not be a single golden bullet to figure out and solve the problems."
singapore,3cja2p,evereddy,-4,Fri Jul 10 09:35:20 2015 UTC,"I think SGreans should cut the MRT and it's management some slack; some of the earliest stations started ops way back in 1987 - that's 28 years ago. I'm sure it has failed occasionally bc the tracks and system have been worn out throughout these years, and also when it was first built it was probably not prepared for the now population of ~5 billion.   And also, despite the numerous breakdowns, it is still arguably more reliable than several railway systems of some of the world's leading countries and cities, eg UK, NZ, NYC. I mean of course we shouldn't be complacent and not strive to improve and work on our problems just bc other countries are doing worse than us, I'm just saying this is a common problem everywhere.   However, having said so much, I am pretty sure you misunderstood my initial statement. I was actually questioning why everyone was so negative towards the PM's comment regarding the MRT situation. Not so much SG's reaction to the double breakdown itself. But it's all good :)"
singapore,3cja2p,ImInUranus,5,Thu Jul 9 04:31:02 2015 UTC,"I think SGreans should cut the MRT and it's management some slack   How about a no? Because it's a public transport corporation with private stakeholders, so there's an obvious conflict of interest.   earliest stations started ops way back in 1987 - that's 28 years ago   There are subways in Asia that have been operating as early as the 1920s (Japan) and they're still functioning fine. If a 28 year-old system is consider antiquated, then what about older subways with less advanced technology that is still chugging along well until today?   it is still arguably more reliable than several railway systems of some of the world's leading countries and cities   True that. But the main arterial line having an epic breakdown? For the efficiency we pride ourselves on, we should be not merely concerned with the problem and look at why two major breakdowns have happened within a span of less than a decade.   I'm just saying this is a common problem everywhere   Discounting the problem is never an option. We fucked it up dramatically, brushing it aside is the last thing we should do.   why everyone was so negative towards the PM's comment regarding the MRT situation   Because we want a leader who's affirmative, not dropping sound bites like the rest of the leaders do. I don't give a hoot if he's ""concerned"" or not - what should we do to solve this problem? Having initiated the SmartNation initiative, his statement on the MRT station is nothing short of being unthoughtful. An affirmative answer, like ""we will ensure this will never happen again"" instead of ""this is a problem that will randomly happen at any point of time, and we don't know if this will happen again"" would be very much preferred."
singapore,3cja2p,tsukuruu,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:39:42 2015 UTC,"you cannot ever say ""it will never happen again"" ... complex systems like public transport does not work like that ... which is why he cannot say it. in fact, what he is saying is, that they don't even understand the root cause if the problem/failures - and this may take time to sort it. So how can he promise this will never happen again?  Better a leader who is realistic, than one who will just say whatever   someone may wish to hear."
singapore,3cja2p,evereddy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:39:44 2015 UTC,"Fair enough to all the above mentioned points, however my opinion still stands that Singaporeans are hitting too hard on PM'S comment on the breakdown. If I'm not wrong this was his first time commenting on it, proving the severity of the issue. If it recurs and he issues the same type of statement with no improvements made, then yes, it's all for PR purposes (all talk no action). But it's still too early to tell. (Cannot say for Tuck Yew lah, I'm talking specifically about the actions of PM).   Also I wouldn't like it if he promises that it'll NEVER happen. Never over-promise something you can't guarantee you can keep. Honestly I'm OK with his statement of him being concerned that it will happen again bc it means that he doesn't want it to happen and so will take preventive measures to make sure it's doesn't repeat, but there's no guarantee there. At least to me, he's not making empty promises but also saying that he'll do his best in combating this problem."

They have been living their entire lives aside from the issues faced by Singaporeans- COE, ERP, HDB balloting, culture clashes from living/working with swaths of foreigners. What's fucking worse is that money corrupts, power corrupts; so don't tell me the ministers ""grew up not well-off"" and can empathise. You can tell how power corrupts by how your normal friends start turning into assholes when they get into their BMWs and Volvos and start driving. Much less, the corrupting power of wealth.  So the point of Lui Tuck Yew standing there is to show the peasants that he cares OR that he's on-top of the situation at ground zero. If it's the former, the peasants would rather he show concern at 730am, JE/Bedok Stations.

So he should never step out of his office lah, great that sounds so logical when the problem isnt in his office room, or even in Transport Ministry HQ.  I love how you immediately assumed the worst of his behavior simply because it is Lui Tuck Yew."
singapore,3chmh0,raymmm,9,Wed Jul 8 04:52:07 2015 UTC,"Why do you think he's only there to have a photo taken. I love how you immediately assumed the worst of his behavior simply because it is Lui Tuck Yew.   I'm simply commenting on the photo that his team have chosen for the press release. It's clear that the intention is to show the govt ""at work"". That's the whole point of publishing such photos isn't it?  Even then, let's give him the benefit of doubt and assume that he is there as you say, to ""monitor some of the situation with his own eyes"". That begs the question of ""what situation?"" As others in this thread have pointed out, this location is cherry picked to show a highly unrealistic picture of what the morning rush crowd is like.   Furthermore, does he not have men who can do this groundwork for him so he can assess the situation more effectively from whatever control room he has? Doesn't this just give opportunity for critics to say that he is wasting time by not doing Minister level work(million dollar salaries, etc)? The timing of pictures like these is extremely poor as well, people wouldn't get so worked up about it if he does things like that a month from now.  I love how you assume that I have some sort of bias against Lui when all I did was comment on ONE instance of poor decision making for publicity."
singapore,3chmh0,pkismeyea,0,Wed Jul 8 05:38:13 2015 UTC,The photo is not from his team. It wasn't a press release. CNA reporter took that photo. Source: https://m.facebook.com/ChannelNewsAsiaSingapore/photos/pb.93889432933.-2207520000.1436351938./10152988782132934/?type=1&source=42

Why is our transport minister 'deeply concerned' but the CEO if the SMRT 'no news no sound'?  It just shows (to me) that the minister just treats this as another PR exercise.

singapore,3chmh0,hamsalamibacon,5,Wed Jul 8 01:20:18 2015 UTC,I expect him to do his job at the level that is equal to the pay we give him and not have the single largest public transport system failure under his watch. A system failure that was even bigger then the one under his predecessor.   If we do not hold him accountable then who will?
singapore,3chmh0,oklos,17,Wed Jul 8 02:56:59 2015 UTC,"Allow me to rephrase the question since you seem bent on blaming him/someone.  If a system has been ill maintained for the past 10 years, how can you expect ANYBODY, including yourself, to be able to fix it in a mere 3 years? It isn't even a physically possible task.  He's doing a pretty decent job given the shit that he started with."
singapore,3chmh0,raymmm,9,Wed Jul 8 03:05:55 2015 UTC,"thank you for providingg a fresh breath of perspective. i'm sure he isn't the only one to blame either, and even if he is at fault, i doubt it's constructive to go around blaming him like this. :("

singapore,3chmh0,sjioldboy,4,Wed Jul 8 03:31:52 2015 UTC,So your idea of a decent job is having an even bigger system failure then his predecessor? When do we stop giving him chances and making excuses for him and holding him accountable?

singapore,3chmh0,oklos,6,Wed Jul 8 03:40:50 2015 UTC,The question then is how the public is supposed to make any sort of assessment as to whether he is helping to improve the situation.
singapore,3chmh0,Slavor,-6,Wed Jul 8 04:03:23 2015 UTC,"For this incident? Unless you know ppl within SMRT who can tell you what LTY has said to them or how he has planned things, there's no way you can make an informed judgement call."

singapore,3chmh0,Bearswithjetpacks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:34:55 2015 UTC,If they admit that the trains have been ill maintained for the past 10 years and assign some blame then maybe I can close one eye. But they didn't. Why should we begin with that assumption for them and give whoever is in charge now a free pass?
singapore,3chmh0,aintcoming,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:33:01 2015 UTC,I didn't make the assumption for them. They did admit that there were severe lapses in maintenance at SMRT and it wasn't adequate for the system.  You can read the SMRT COI Report for the breakdowns in 2011; it's a 358 page report though and I'm not sure if you want to bore yourself with it...
singapore,3chmh0,hamsalamibacon,6,Wed Jul 8 15:50:23 2015 UTC,"Bro, we are all exasperated but yunnnn's right: the damage isn't under his watch. When he took over the Transport Ministry & realized how bad the infrastructure is, he announced a 8-year MRT upgrading plan within a year. This being 2015, we're only into Year 3; the renewal process will take 5 more freaking years.  At least he puts himself in the public limelight & take the flak. You see how much the LTA CEO &, until recently, the SMRT CEO hide behind him? They are the ones actually in charge or overseeing the rail network. Do you recall their respective predecessors -- Raymond Lim the MOT minister, Yam Ah Mee (yes, that elections results announcer) & assorted LTA heads, or Saw Phaik Hwa the SMRT boss -- ever coming clean to this day? They are the ones more accountable for being so irresponsibly neglectful."
singapore,3chmh0,aintcoming,0,Wed Jul 8 19:18:54 2015 UTC,"I just feel there isn't much point now in directing all the blame to him just because he's all the way on top. Ministerial salaries have been and will always be a matter of contention that has been and will always be discussed extensively elsewhere, so there's no need to keep emphasizing that he should be doing a job that matches how much he's being paid (as much as I agree with you on that, really).  Rather than assigning blame, wouldn't it be more constructive for the discussion to revolve how the problem can be solved?

singapore,3chmh0,sg_no_comment,4,Wed Jul 8 09:25:47 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the million-dollar salaries can never be ignored. As long as they are being paid that sort of money, the political expectations will just remain that high, even if they are arguably irrational."

singapore,3chmh0,Slavor,4,Wed Jul 8 10:02:59 2015 UTC,"Not at all, actually. Ministers are elected MPs; they are supposed to be politicians, which implies some ability to garner public support.  It's just that many ministers/MPs, including him, seem to be rather bad at it."

singapore,3chmh0,croissanwich,10,Wed Jul 8 04:00:51 2015 UTC,"There is a simple solution, take SMRT and SBS out of for profit privatisation and take it back to the public domain where it should have been in the first place. However you are right, we can't do anything about it since no one will listen to us as there is no accountability at the top and they are just going to do what ever they want anyway."
singapore,3chmh0,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz,6,Wed Jul 8 06:07:13 2015 UTC,"Our government loves to create artificial competition to promote efficiency. I do see dismantling monopolies could work in some industries, but I'm not sure about public transport  Can different companies compete to provide the fastest travel at lowest cost between point A and point B? That's what it would take for us to benefit from induced competition."
singapore,3chmh0,aintcoming,5,Wed Jul 8 01:46:08 2015 UTC,"To add on, I'll repost what I said   Especially since MRT service is effectively a monopoly - I'm normally for privatisation but when other companies can't effectively compete there's little point.   As it is, there is limited land to build tracks, and in any case even if the government allowed more to be built by private companies it will take a long time to build. Competition between say, taxi services can work, since the roads remain public property, but that model cannot be applies to individual trains and the MRT tracks."
singapore,3chmh0,MaddST,3,Wed Jul 8 02:51:15 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the government's initiative to buy back buses from SMRT and SBS and then awarding routes on a contractual basis with conditions and rewards for service standards met.   I believe they studied models from countries like Britain and Australia where such systems are in place. I think it's an idea worth exploring, because it does induce real competition.   I'm sure if it was financially viable at the moment the government would certainly want to do the same for the MRT system too. But buying back trains aren't as cheap as buying back buses..."
singapore,3chmh0,Razorwindsg,0,Wed Jul 8 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"This privatisation was not to induce competition for the benefit of the consumer, it was privatisation for the sake of profit"
singapore,3chmh0,aintcoming,-9,Wed Jul 8 10:29:06 2015 UTC,Sure. Why don't you write a blog post about your theory.
singapore,3chmh0,scalarp,3,Wed Jul 8 03:07:04 2015 UTC,"it has been shown in many studies that private companies work more efficient than public ones. that means more production with less resources.   in a private firm, SMRT, in its bid for more profits, will need to lower costs in order to satisfy its shareholders. they can also afford to take more risk and maneuver faster to changes in the economic climate.   if SMRT is reverted back to a govt agency, the costs will ballooned due to the many pitfalls of a govt agency. the bureaucracy, the red tapes (ever tried Gebiz?),  and the unwilling to cut costs (sacking someone in govt svc is almost unheard of).  guess who will be covering these costs? yes, you and me. it helps to think two steps ahead rather than giving a kneejerk reaction."
singapore,3chmh0,dtwn,10,Wed Jul 8 03:11:59 2015 UTC,The major caveat to your first point is that real competition must exist in offer for your point to be true. Thus I hope the government can move towards awarding train lines on a contractual basis.
singapore,3chmh0,scalarp,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:28:29 2015 UTC,"Easier said than done. Now that the genie is out of the bottle, to take then under public stewardship would cost millions, potentially even billions. Trains and buses aren't cheap.   The best bet we have going forward would be the government awarding train lines on a contractual basis, although that too would be very expensive."

singapore,3cj3zo,Jofnd,2,Thu Jul 9 03:16:11 2015 UTC,"im saying that private school is also rigged, though not as shitty as the mills are. just put 1 question to you, how do you compare yourself to a NTU/NUS same sub student? is the knowledge transfer similar? have you gain as much as what they did?  at least from what i see among all my mates who took private vs gov uni, the knowledge is totally incomparable.   so now, im a employer, i will definitely give you a university level question if you come to interview in my company, the question will be fair and relate to the job and is something you suppose to know and learn in mid lvl university.  after interviewing so much candidates, im quite honest to say, many private school graduate cannot answer basic theorem and solve problems of uni subject which relate to real work.   of course if you are like me who have a passion for what you studied and attended private, you would find out more and learn more on those. but if you were just a private degree grads, sorry, those things that was taught to you isnt enough compared to NTU/NUS. period."

Ethnically, yes, the natives of the land are Malays, from Vietnam to PNG, but to say immigrants are other races coming onto this island is recent is factually untrue.   The Chinese and Malays have always coexisted together, at least, since way back in the 14th century back when Singapore was already part of the active Indonesian archipelago. Singapore was never in a vacuum on its own.   The idea that the Chinese/foreigners stole land is very, very, untrue, and ignorant. It puts Malays in the kind of light whereby hundreds of years later they still can't learn to live with other races. It's the Malay superiority/inferiority complex.  Another fun fact, Singapore was practically given to the British by nobody else but the Malays (Sultan of Johor) in exchange for material wealth.    So, please. Nobody stole land from the Malays. They sat on it, gave it away, lingered around and woke up one day to realise someone else turned a profit and now the kampung wants to claim it as their own."

I believe that since the whole cemetery is earmarked for a future public housing estate, it may be good to petition for a World Heritage status, to ensure that the government does not do anything funny to a site that has been the resting place of a lot of pioneers of Singapore.  However, I have to emphasise the fact that the government really does not give a single damn about status, as Rochor Centre was marked as a 'Protected Landmark' by URA, but you all know what is going to happen to Rochor Centre, am I right? Just shows how much lip service is done to protect, but in the end, national interest and pragmatism takes precedence.  However, we are also to blame for the systematic reallocation of our heritage sites, as the people of Singapore do not give a damn about our heritage sites and landmarks, till the day it is announced that it will go. I believe that most of us who did not know about Bukit Brown and its history (including me), did not give a damn about it, till we hear from the government that 5,000 of its graves must go. We must raise awareness amongst ourselves, about the sheer amount of heritage buildings that are still standing in Singapore. By doing so, we could show the government that we really care about our sites. Until then, haizz."

If you're living in the Central area, there's Hobby Art Gallery at Sunshine Plaza.  In the east, there's Hobby Art Workshop (Hobby Art Gallery's main office!) and Hobby Point at Tampines.

I was just starting out and I kinda spammed pics trying to ask them how to improve and stuff and they say that I always have a problem of oversanding and stuff. They're full time workers so I guess they got kinda pissed I bombarded their phone. Plus, I mostly do OOBs with the occasional painting and detailing if I like it.

singapore,3cho46,mayotoast,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:18:40 2015 UTC,"Paging for /u/mayotoast to give his thoughts.   On one hand, price hikes are expected because there is more demand. Want to get home quick then pay more lo. The same goes when the demand drops too.   Unless its a natural disaster or its an emergency medical situation, dont see why the prices cant go up.   On the other hand, 5x is a bit expensive. But the price is made clear with the app.   Whether it is possible for Uber and the drivers to abuse the system and inflate the prices is unclear to me (i never use before). But i do know that even normal cabs abuse their own system like by parking at tanah merah ferry terminal and wait for arriving passengers to make booking instead of flagging."
singapore,3cho46,PavanJ,2,Wed Jul 8 09:52:16 2015 UTC,"There isn't a way for drivers to game the system and refuse booking till it surges. In fact one common mistake for us is to chase the surge, only to enter surge zone and surge ends.   I think normal surge up to 2x is quite ok, anything more or due to natural disasters as in the States, or due to trains failing, the surge should be capped at, say 3X.   Driving for uber is stressful, cause you keep thinking and looking out for surge, chasing it, or upon getting it have to deal with picky customers since they are paying for surge pricing. That's why I'm still sticking to driving for Grab only.   Edit: surge pricing and estimate is clearly shown in passenger app. They will ask you to key 5x go confirm they know the fares are 5x before booking goes through.   Complaining after knowing that's going to be the price, oh man, quite retarded to be honest."

singapore,3cho46,bibibabibu,2,Wed Jul 8 00:50:36 2015 UTC,"Uber informs you of the surge pricing before you request the vehicle.  Don't really see a problem with it to be honest.  They are a private business, they do not owe anybody anything."
singapore,3cho46,damjancd,4,Wed Jul 8 08:41:46 2015 UTC,"I understand it's within the rights of uber to charge as much as they like as a private enterprise. However, I don't agree with that as uber markets itself and acts like a public transport taxi service but at the same time uses such predatory business tactics. If they want to market themselves as a taxi alternative, then play by the same rules with regulation of drivers, cars, availability and fares. If they want to be private car hire then market themselves as that. That's a reason for regulations to safeguard interest of the public with regards to public transport. Looking back to the days of unlicensed taxis in the past, I would say that a dose of regulation is good for this industry. If free market was in play for public transportation, then your bus and mrt fares will be 10 dollars cause who's going to compete with them? You might understand their business model and identify them as not a public transport, but is it the fault of the commuters not understanding that, as uber has marketed itself as a taxi alternative and not a private hire alternative."
singapore,3cho46,zed_j,2,Wed Jul 8 04:24:20 2015 UTC,"If they want to market themselves as a taxi alternative, then play by the same rules with regulation of drivers, cars, availability and fares.   Totally agree. I cannot argue with surge pricing model as that's their entire business model. But Uber is essentially touting themselves as a taxi alternative but is refusing to be subject to regulation."
singapore,3cho46,damjancd,-2,Wed Jul 8 07:59:49 2015 UTC,Want safeguards? Then you won't get cars. Simple as that. Fucking idiotic reasoning that surge pricing is bad.
singapore,3cho46,dingjer,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:22:14 2015 UTC,"You clearly missed the context of my argument. What I'm saying is surge pricing is bad for public transport, because public transport is to cater for the public and not just the rich and fares are regulated to prevent pricing out the folks of a certain income level. If uber doesn't try to portray itself as a public transport provider and instead portray itself as a private chauffeur service with variable prices, there's no issue with that. If essential goods with not much substitutability are based on demand and supply alone, things that are essential such as transportation will be priced out of reach of people of certain income. Just like public and private hospitals, there's nothing wrong with private hospitals charging more, but don't advertise themselves as public hospitals and charge private prices as that is preying on most people's preconceived expectations on public goods."
singapore,3cho46,Karlypilkboys,0,Wed Jul 8 10:03:02 2015 UTC,"Pricing out of certain folks already is happening. ERT? Supply and demand is not just about profit and greed, but about infusing a system with structure so it could function.  Have you ever seen an ad by uber publicizing itself as public transport? What the hell is public transport? How can you advertise yourself as a public institution or service?"
singapore,3cho46,happyh0rse,13,Wed Jul 8 10:40:39 2015 UTC,"Not mentioned in the article: that Uber states price surges expressly on the app before letting users book their rides.  Now if users weren't happy with the price surge, why even book the ride in the first place? Demand was certainly high at that point of time, and a price surge is one incentive to get more Uber cars on the streets.  Uber's 5x price surge (which, I agree, is ridiculous) was probably an automated mechanism that was triggered due to extremely high demand (my guess). Disabling surge is only an act of goodwill on Uber's part and wasn't something Uber had to do; they're after all a business that survives on profits.  Whether Uber decides to refund the surges charged is also entirely their choice, but I guess in their best interests they would."

Uber did not cheat or pull a fast one on anyone.   However, people will be angry because this seems exploitative, especially because it happened in their hour of need. It's like hawking medical supplies in a disaster zone. True, the commuters need not take Uber; they could have walked home, choose to get squeezed out of buses, or fruitlessly try to hail a cab .  I really don't understand the hate for people who got ripped off ITT. They may have had an emergency or personal urgent matters to attend to. Uber may be entitled to their price hikes, but commuters are just as entitled to grumbling about being exploited. For some reason people here have chosen to fixate on the culpability of commuters."
singapore,3cho46,mwolfee,4,Wed Jul 8 03:15:51 2015 UTC,"I believe the surge system is automated and monitors demand for Ubers in a given area and adjusts the surge accordingly. To their credit, they took away the surge pricing and offered to refund riders who paid the 5x surge."

singapore,3cho46,Karlypilkboys,0,Wed Jul 8 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"How is this exploitative?  The entire business strategy of uber is to match demand and supply. They are not the taxi company,  who because of the increase in demand refused to pick passengers off the street just to wait for a booking.  That is economic dead weight loss right there.   Having a pure demand and supply mechanism is much better. It's like being angry at the sun for shining. The customers were not scammed or hoodwinked into paying more  they choose to pay more and yet they complain. They should be directing their  anger at smrt,  so did not do their job properly."
singapore,3cho46,onique,5,Wed Jul 8 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"This actually happened 2 years ago in the Northeast US during Hurricane Sandy. Uber was raised by 6x at one point. But there is a non-evil reason behind this.  Uber's marketing point (maybe not clear in Singapore) is that you will always get a car when you request for one. Price is the way it differentiates between the urgency of a customer. A passenger heading to the hospital to see their parents on their dying bed would have gotten a car while a rich office person may have just decided to spend the 5x surge fee on a nice dinner in the city. The price serves as a mechanism to allocate drivers to the most in need passengers.   Without the surge pricing, there would be no way of allocating cars based on need. Whoever presses the button first would get the car. Uber would not have cars available in that area, and no one can get a car. Surge pricing makes the passenger reconsider.  Credit card payment of Uber also means you don't have to worry about the cost yet as you rush off to your important destination. Uber can also refund some of the fee after negative PR pressure before the bill comes in."

singapore,3cez4p,mediumdeviation,6,Tue Jul 7 15:42:16 2015 UTC,"As /u/nssucks so succinctly put it, you really can't. The logistics of it is quite impossible. Your typical transport node plans it's resources in advance carefully, so there's usually not that much spare capacity left. Even if there are spare vehicles and operators, activating them would take too long - transport operators are not on 24/7 standby for this (and before you say there should be, remember that having them on standby eats into the resources too), so you'd have to rouse them, force them to change, attend to their vehicles, and move out in an organized manner. That's going to take half an hour if we're very optimistic (45 minutes to an hour is more realistic). Your typical SAF camp is pretty far from any MRT station. Give them another 15 minutes to reach a station. That's 45-75 minutes already.   A 5-tonner is woefully inefficient when it comes to moving people compared to a bus. It's capacity is about half of your typical bus, since there's no standing room. It's very slow to load because you have to use the tailboard, and it's incredibly uncomfortable because of the lack of air-conditioning and it's very stiff suspension and tires. It's also slower than a bus, so it's probably going to be making less trips.   And finally, there needs to be the command resource needed to coordinate, plan, and authorize the movement of these vehicles. That's probably the hardest, and although I have no idea how long this might take in theory, experience tells me by the time the organization catches up to this the entire thing will probably be over."

singapore,3cez4p,merovign,3,Tue Jul 7 22:54:29 2015 UTC,"If an operator and vehicle are put on standby, they can't be doing anything else. It's like reserving a table - if you ask them to do actual driving details while on standby, then it defeats the entire purpose of being on standby"

The spillover onto the bus services and the public roads was terrifying. Saw tweets saying traffic was practically locked in town. As a fully urbanized country, such a breakdown is not simply inconvenience, it's a matter of grave national security :/"

During operations, trains will arrive at average intervals of five to seven minutes. Commuters may also encounter intermittent short delays until the problems are definitively resolved and the system stabilised. SMRT will provide free travel for commuters exiting stations on the NSEWL until normal service resumes.  Services on the NSL will be suspended for a few hours from 11am to allow LTA and SMRT engineers to conduct further investigations to determine the cause of the power trip that led to the shutdown of power across the entire network yesterday.  While LTA and SMRT engineers have narrowed down the possible causes of the problem, and are in the process of rectifying the faults discovered, it is not yet conclusive, and they would need more time to ascertain the situation definitively.  Service on the EWL will continue to operate throughout the day but at reduced speed as a matter of precaution and safety.  If the trains run normally during the morning, and continuing investigations during the morning pinpoint the fault conclusively, it may not be necessary to shut down the NSL from 11am to 4pm.  However, commuters are advised to plan, for now, on the basis of such closure, and to check for updates before starting their trip. Information will be available on the SMRT website, LTA and SMRT Facebook and Twitter accounts, LTA Traffic News and MyTransport.SG. We will keep commuters regularly and promptly updated throughout the day.  With the rail network not operating at full capacity, commuters are encouraged to adjust their travel plans or use the alternative services provided by the bus network and rail lines in operation.  Free bus service will be available from designated bus stops and bus interchanges in close proximity to NSEWL stations. Up to 100 additional buses will be deployed to ply the affected rail corridors. Commuters can continue to use services provided on the North East Line (NEL), Circle Line (CCL) and Downtown Line (DTL). The NEL and CCL will extend their morning peak period by two hours such that trains will run at intervals of between two and three minutes during the morning peak hours.]( https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=971520436202519&substory_index=0&id=566549713366262)"

singapore,3cez4p,joeyfjj,3,Tue Jul 7 13:35:51 2015 UTC,"Pure speculation : Company reduced work force in order to save money. Most of the old senior technicians are their target because they are the one getting high salary by serving long time there and having enormous experience about things they have been working on for many years.  The company reduced more than half of them, remaining people are some sort of rehired or something, replaced the required manpower with new generation but lesser in quantity. In this way the company need to spend lesser money in two ways, lower salary + lesser manpower.  That's the year the mastermind got hefty million bonus. I have heard from those old timers saying that there is not enough manpower and new comers cannot know every little thing and they don't have enough time to do everything. Anyway major breakdown happened later that year.  Things are not getting better from that point. Looks like that department is not really get back to what they once were. More breakdown than ever.

Swimming?"
singapore,3ch8hu,irlando,6,Wed Jul 8 00:49:15 2015 UTC,"Yes but in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand. The beaches in Singapore aren't great and the sea water is pretty dirty do people don't swim in the sea afaik. Dragon boating, kayaking are popular and some people do wind surfing, sailing etc.  Another thing to know about sports culture here is that due to the heat people go early. I know a lot of people who get up at 4am or 5am for training."

singapore,3ch8hu,MrBottle,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:56:41 2015 UTC,"Yup, I'm referring to that. I've checked the price but it's too expensive. $35 for 2 hours of K1. That'll quickly burn a huge hole in my pocket."

Now I feel bad that I rarely go to the beach/never surfed before/can't really swim. I went to Lazarus Island last week with some friends, the beach there was really nice! I think you'd enjoy it. Apart from that, you can spot the usual beach goers at Sentosa's various beaches, suntanning, playing volleyball, the likes. The biggest issue is that it is ridiculously hot and it feels like a beach (weather-wise) everywhere else in the country as well.   P.S. Don't think there is a big surfing culture in Singapore? Unless you count wakeboarding and that expensive looking thingie in Sentosa"

singapore,3ch8hu,mhawks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:38:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm there isn't a big beach culture here. We have no high waves (we build a surfing simulator, how about that?), clear waters, or pristine beaches. This is mostly due to the high sea traffic we have in our waters. It's not surprising to see rubbish on our beaches that were brought in by the tide. Your best bet is to go to Sentosa where the beaches are alright.  Nice beaches are a short jaunt away from here. Check out places like Phuket (Thailand), Tioman (Malaysia) or Halong Bay (Vietnam)"
singapore,3ch8hu,Asyrol,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:04:40 2015 UTC,"Is it common for people to go there for beach days, or is it more like a long weekend getaway? How long does it take to get to those three? Cost?"
singapore,3ch8hu,mhawks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:37:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah mostly for long weekends. All three places are within 4 - 5 hours away. You can spend as low as $500 to an upwards of $2000. It depends on what you want.   For normal weekends you can try Bintan or Batam (google please). My friend goes there like every fortnightly to get a massage and just relax. Not much to do there though. Or if you just can to lounge on a beach, Sentosa will do fine.  People here also like to go for ""staycations"" where they book a hotel or resort in SG and just relax."

singapore,3ch8hu,rainforest_runner,-1,Thu Jul 9 10:57:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to hear that you will be parting with your best friend :(  Anyway, for your last question, no unfortunately.  The only ""beach culture"" that is most popular in Singapore is the Tanjong Beach Club thing that happens every Sunday for all the ""pretentious, wealthy, beautiful people"" that us normal people don't really gather around, or perhaps something like Zouk Out that happens every year end at the same place. Basically clubbing at the beach.  Other than that, unfortunately there are no waves to talk about for surfing here. There's a big running, marathon, biathlon, aquathlon, Triathlon culture however. And if you want waves? Indonesia is just one flight away...I heard the great ones are in the West side of Sumatra island however. But I don't know what the actual names of the beaches."
singapore,3ch8hu,sghookupthrowaway,6,Wed Jul 8 00:56:30 2015 UTC,"Tanjong Beach Club thing that happens every Sunday for all the ""pretentious, wealthy, beautiful people"" that us normal people don't really gather around   This is bullshit advice. If you don't like it, that's fine. Don't shit on it. Tanjong Beach Club is a great place to chill out by the beach. Contrary to what you think, all sorts of people go there, and it's not as pretentious as you make it out to be.  /u/Asyrol, ignore this advice. The Tanjong Beach Club is popular among foreigners, and this sub generally has a problem with expat hangouts. I know you're moving in soon, and it is great for you to immerse yourself in local culture. But you really have to take some of the advice with a grain of salt. The general population here are people studying or doing NS, living with their parents, and with limited spending power. Their opinions about what is fun and what is not fun differs from the average foreigner moving in who has quite some money at his/her disposal.  There is a reason why expats choose to frequent expat forums instead of this place: /r/singapore is overrun by holier-than-thou Singaporeans who really haven't had much exposure outside of their island."
singapore,3ch8hu,irlando,5,Wed Jul 8 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"I'm a Westerner and I don't like TBC, to each their own :)  I do agree with you though that a lot of what is discussed in this forum is very locally oriented, not that there's anything wrong with that. Heck it should be locally oriented, it's /r/Singapore :)  Your caveat is right though, once Asyrol moves here, the odds are high that her and her partner will be mostly hanging out with other Westerners who are earning more than some of the people on this thread and spending their money in very different ways too. That's just the way a lot of Westerners end up living here. So it's good advice to understand where the advice is coming from. It's not bad advice, but some of it will be at odds with what she hears from other Westerners (and from richer Singaporeans) when she moves here."
singapore,3ch8hu,Asyrol,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:41:25 2015 UTC,"Ooooh I take everyone's advice with a grain of salt, but as a true Canadian do so graciously. I'm aware of the anti-foreigner sentiment that can sometimes come across and I do frequent expat forums which sometimes have a very anti-local vibe. I come to both to get a wide variety of options to help inform my own :-)  even before your comment I had decided to check it out at least once to see what it's all about, keeping everything I've heard about it (good and bad) in mind :-)  Thank you though for your insight! :-)"

singapore,3ch8hu,rainforest_runner,-2,Wed Jul 8 06:00:40 2015 UTC,Sluttica has more Asian girls than white ones. OP wants white girls.
singapore,3ch8hu,oratorioo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:00:37 2015 UTC,really? Usually the level one has lots of Asians but the second level is quite okay. Got to know an Irish gal from there . Love it when they say fuck.

singapore,3ci0lj,dashrandom,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:35:11 2015 UTC,Listening to oldies every once in awhile puts things in perspective for me too. It's crazy to think how music has lasted through time and still remains relevant!

singapore,3ci0lj,hkxz,3,Wed Jul 8 02:20:31 2015 UTC,Did you just grad too? Haha. Well... Finance because I have a finance degree and I have a love hate relationship with it. I'm at that point in my life where you don't really know where to step next.

singapore,3ci0lj,ARE_U_FUCKING_SORRY,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:58:08 2015 UTC,Don't stress me man :(  Applied to a lot of places but very few have gotten back to me. Guess my resume just isn't good enough.  Do you work in the industry as well?
singapore,3ci0lj,ImInUranus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:04:19 2015 UTC,"I've just graduated in May 2015. NUS Biz too I assume?  And regarding jobs, I started applying for jobs in September 2014 as that's when the banks open their program hiring for the following year's intake. I think right now only direct hire positions are open. My friend was offered a direct hire role at a bulge bracket recently."
singapore,3ci0lj,ImInUranus,2,Wed Jul 8 09:20:32 2015 UTC,"So many of us here. If OP posted this thread before 7/7, I would've felt... gaowei."

Had a wild idea to start this kind of get-to-know-you thread when I first joined /r/singapore too but I was afraid of people accidentally doxxing themselves.   Anyway, here's some non-private facts about me -  female, 21, waiting to start uni in SIT, I love listening to the Oldies (Carpenters, Bee Gees, Chicago etc). What I like to do in my spare time.... uhh.. listen to more music? Hahhaha I like music a lot, so much so that I worked in the music-industry for a while after graduating from poly but sadly I can't play it as I suck at reading scores. So yeah. :)"
singapore,3ci0lj,ivyliciousme,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:34:54 2015 UTC,"That's rare ! Any chance you listen to America, Bread and Electric Light Orchestra too? Those are my favourites !"

singapore,3ci0lj,ImpulseAurora,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:57:43 2015 UTC,I used to play in a guitar ensemble and we played ELO ALL THE TIME. Amazing songs they have that make you just wanna smile amirite. It's hard to survive doing music in Singapore. As much as I would love to follow my dreams I cannot survive here doing it. So that's that :/
singapore,3ci0lj,ARE_U_FUCKING_SORRY,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:20:35 2015 UTC,What did you do in the music industry? (Broad term)
singapore,3ci0lj,ImpulseAurora,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:50:06 2015 UTC,I did PR and Marcomm for one of the record labels

singapore,3ci0lj,BarneyLovesYou,-1,Wed Jul 8 08:08:40 2015 UTC,I love oldies too! Looks like a lot of young people love oldies these days.
singapore,3ci0lj,BarneyLovesYou,2,Wed Jul 8 02:48:41 2015 UTC,I think it's got to do with the fact that a lot of pop music these days don't make any sense; lyrics are meaningless and there's excessive use of electronic effects. Lyrics are the most impt part of the song to me and Oldies have the sweetest and/or most heart-breaking lyrics to them. I love it!
singapore,3ci0lj,_HR,2,Wed Jul 8 02:58:30 2015 UTC,I think we're the same kind of people who value the meaning of the songs more than anything else. It explains why I can't enjoy k-pop. It's just gibberish to me.

I started delving into Korean music through Leessang and only because of Running Man. I'm discovering new tastes in Korean indie too.
singapore,3ci0lj,kopi_peng,2,Wed Jul 8 11:30:38 2015 UTC,"Lol, do i know you? Yeah had both contracts infront of me, two routes, guards then SOF or RSAF.  Signed the latter then and never looked back.  Same here, watching running man due to being TAC-ie -> leessang -> khiphop -> SMTM."

singapore,3ci0lj,HamTheManVII,0,Wed Jul 8 06:21:37 2015 UTC,There's so much fantastic hip hop outside of USA too. My favourite is this Belgian-Congolese rapper called Baloji. His album Hotel Impala is one of the best produced albums I've recently heard.

singapore,3ci0lj,Feelgoodfood,3,Wed Jul 8 07:25:25 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be brutally honest with you.   The Singapore music scene is pretty shit. And I say that from almost 7 years playing in the scene. For one, you can never get enough support playing the music you love. At every show it is the same few faces. There are people who are very passionate about the scene and I respect that, but it will never reach a stage where there is a good crowd of people.   Sure there are a few bands that have made it pretty big overseas (think wormrot), but most of the people playing in bands here have no idea how to market themselves. They think it's all just fun and games but don't realize having a band is no different from managing a business, but even harder.   It's not easy and if the scene were to ever flourish a lot more effort is needed, plus the fact that we do not have enough people interested enough to build a subculture.   But have a great time playing what you love man! Meet people and play your heart out :D Maybe I'll see your band at a show one day."
singapore,3ci0lj,IamAnoobcake,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:58:11 2015 UTC,"I echo your comments about marketing! We're having a figuring out our shit to make things serious, we're also in nac's noise music mentorship getting schooled about that too . We'll see each other around soon I hope!  😁"

singapore,3ciy0y,mwolfee,7,Wed Jul 8 07:56:45 2015 UTC,"Paged!  Trains have battery that can support auxiliary systems such as lighting and ventilation (and maybe comms? Not too sure).   In fact, there are gaps in the power-supplying third rail that allows different sectors on the track to be isolated, as well as at track crossings. The on-board battery ensures the lights and systems continue working when travelling across these short power gaps, as opposed to cutting out and back in."

singapore,3cfhkd,KeythKatz,5,Tue Jul 7 15:34:03 2015 UTC,"Nope. There will still be a cost. It might turn out similarly to the new bus model, where SMRT could be kicked out for a new operator, or it could simply be SMRT paying a fixed cost to the government, and in turn the government pays for everything.  Either way, it's better than what we have currently."
singapore,3cfhkd,joeyfjj,2,Tue Jul 7 15:47:56 2015 UTC,"To add and clarify: bus contracting model works like this:   Operator is paid a fixed amount for their services Government owns all operating assets They may be given incentives or fines based on performance (for example, such as headways and deviation from schedule) All fare income is retained by LTA, so this risk is now absorbed by the government."
singapore,3cfhkd,joeyfjj,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:33:35 2015 UTC,"It should be similar to the Bus Contracting Model as /u/KeythKatz mentioned.

They're the same type of people who cannot see the forest for the woods.  The key reason for all these train failures is that the early MRT system was never designed to take the load and thoroughput capacity of so many passengers.  And why did this happen? We all know who opened the floodgates.  And did they foresee this and make million-dollar salary worthy plans ahead? We all know.  Just like how housing prices and demand  skyrocketed during that period and yet the supply was never adjusted for the increase. We all know.  So go ahead, down vote this comment so that it'll never see the light of day because you want people to read the right things. I don't give a single fuck.  Edit: So after down-voting this comment to 0 and below for sure, no brave soul dares to refute the substance of this comment I wrote? You lot are disgraceful brainless cowards."
singapore,3cfhkd,DarkInsight,6,Tue Jul 7 15:43:43 2015 UTC,"First off, some disclaimers: I am not trying to argue with you or counter your argument, I am genuinely curious with what happened.   The key reason for all these train failures is that the early MRT system was never designed to take the load and thoroughput capacity of so many passengers.   Are we sure if this is true? Are you an engineer? What are some of these inherent weakness in early MRT system that fails to scale up, can't they be patched up in future upgrade?   And why did this happen? We all know who opened the floodgates.   Well this is obvious, the government did plan for a higher population target, results in an increasing housing price as well as this load on public transport system. Do you think Singaporean government should have ""aimed low"" for the population instead?  Again, I am not refuting any of your argument. I just want to hear more on what you think."
singapore,3cfhkd,oklos,9,Tue Jul 7 17:09:36 2015 UTC,"the government did plan for a higher population target   Part of the criticism is precisely that they seem not to have actually planned very well for the higher population (primarily in the decade or so after 2000), but had somehow decided that they would accelerate immigration despite this. No proof of this per se, but the impression I get is that they somewhat abandoned the previous MO of managed growth in favour of opening up the gates to increased immigration, partly to take advantage of an economic boom, and partly to address worries over a shrinking population. My guess (based on the technocratic bent of our government and civil service) would be that they expected some difficulties with this logistically, but didn't really expect the scale of the socio-political backlash that it would generate.  Somewhat vaguely, I recall that during a talk/seminar conducted by Liu Thai Ker some years back, he remarked (in passing) that the current population numbers were originally projected to be reached several decades down the road. Coming from someone known as the 'master urban planner' of Singapore, I found that rather telling, even if he didn't really follow up on it."
singapore,3cfhkd,invenue,-11,Wed Jul 8 00:25:03 2015 UTC,"[Again, same caveat to Mods if I cross the line] I answered the part on whether it is true above.  And what the fuck does being an engineer or not have to do with that? Is it about credibility? Another tactic to discredit people who make scientifically factual remarks?  Do I need to tell you about the technical specifications for the early batches of trains and compare them to ride volume, load and frequency? Do I need to tell you to dig out the Hansard excerpts of the targeted population that the MRT system was designed for in the early '80s?  [Edit: I realized I did not answer your question - inherent weaknesses were the lack of adequate expenditure in maintenance during one of the CEO's duration. This information is available in the financial reports and can be compared across the decades. The lack of expenditure can be ""patched up"" by future upgrades yes but it requires the entire ecosystem of maintenance and rolling stock to be upgraded. The problem is that the rolling stock is not something you order and it arrives within months. Some components require advance orders and time for shipment.  Aging trains which should have been retired and replaced with newer ones in a timely manner. The real issue is with management. Management that did not listen to the SMRT engineers of the '90s and '00s especially who kept sounding the alarm.]  And does my floodgates remark automatically imply that I mean the government should aim low? Or are you putting words in my mouth? Assuming I think that way, insinuating or asking me a question?  Let's say you're asking me the question genuinely, then my answer to your question is that your question wasn't even the right one to begin with. It was never about aiming high (wrongly) or aiming low. It was about the government planning and managing the inflow carefully enough that the recent and current problems such as PMETs being replaced by foreigners were reduced to as minimally as possible. But did that happen? No. It was actually the root of all these clusterfuck problems of transport, housing and healthcare.  And if you go back further to the root cause of why the need for inflow, we can point back to the low population growth. Point further, why low population growth? Not simply because of rising standards of living, rising educational standards of people and rising aspirations/selfishness/individualism of people like the government would have to believe, but because people increasingly see how difficult it is to make a living, how costly it is to start a family, how costly housing amongst so many other interlinked issues.  And if you want to further consider housing as one of the root causes, why was housing (apart from the skyrocketing prices caused by the recent floodgates) rising dramatically? Take for example, the Gen X parents - father only usually - in the '80s would only take less than 10 years to pay off their mortgage for a 3-room flat. Now, it takes BOTH parents working 25 years to pay off their mortgage. And little left in CPF for retirement. Tell me - is this progress to you?  Again, point back at CPF - what was the root purpose of CPF? Do you need me to point you to Hon Sui Sen and Goh Keng Swee's Hansards explaining their original purpose?  There are so many other interlinked issues that the scale and complexity of them fully need million dollar salary ministers to deal with. So what's the problem? Our million dollar ministers are not dealing with them and failing!  So tell me, do you still want to engage me further on what I think?  It took me less than 5 minutes to type all this out and this is all the time I will waste online on issues which any thinking Singaporean should reflect on and vote wisely in the next election.  Enough for you? [My apologies seriously if it's too harsh. The frustration is not with you]"
singapore,3cfhkd,CervezaPorFavor,2,Tue Jul 7 18:04:54 2015 UTC,"You made some decent points. But I don't think you need to be hostile about it. It makes people take you less seriously. And you probably get downvoted because of that, not because they disagree with you.  (I am personally affected by skyrocketing housing prices and MRT overcrowding and breakdowns. I sincerely hope these costly mistakes don't become a trend, because we as a country cannot afford it. We used to be envied for our efficiency, foresight and meticulous planning. I hope we can be known for these qualities once again.)  Coming back to topic. As a lay person, I don't think privatisation is really the issue. Japan's railway has been widely acknowledged as the poster child of successful privatisation. Other countries want to emulate this model. In my opinion, the key is great governance (good is not enough), something which we seem to lack, on hindsight."

This is a typical tactic used to detract from the point that this major fuckup has been allowed to drag on over the last 5-10 years. Every time someone makes a critical comment, they are expected to ""suggest"" what needs to be done. What's the key point here? That suggestions have been already made in the past COUNTLESS times to the government on what could be done, some online, some documented in the Hansard, but nooo... this clusterfuck is allowed to perpetuate. [If you ask me to quote Hansard, why don't you go google it yourself?]  Let's say this is not a means to waste people's time in fighting a war of attrition online, then to your comment about load and maintenance, it doesn't take a genius to figure that heavier loads and higher train ride frequencies wear our tracks, wheels and various mechanical parts of the train faster, which leads to higher maintenance. Do I need to be a fucking engineer to tell you facts which are common sense and anyone who has been through secondary school education can tell you?

Everyone can whine and criticise, but not all criticism is useful and constructive."
singapore,3cfhkd,movingchicane,6,Tue Jul 7 21:10:14 2015 UTC,"FYI they supposedly have finished upgrading the north south line this year, and was about to start on the east west line. Also, it seems that it was the north south line that was the issue, and again it seems that it was a train that led to the system failure and not the tracks.   This leads me to 2 questions.    Why is an integral infrastructure of our nation this fragile? And why is there no redundancy built into it.  Since the initial reports suggest it was rolling stock that caused the issue this time, does this mean the rolling stock is not being well maintained?"

For fuck's sake, what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander right? Since the pro-establishment people like to shove their views down the throats of people who voice out with constructive criticisms in the past and still continue to do so, do you expect frustrated people who suffer these breakdowns to sit by, mumble meekly and wave it off?  Grow a fucking pair of balls and learn to swallow criticism of ALL kind just as I accept that pro-establishment people do so.

This is especially important for you because you have a history of back injury. Focus mainly on your core muscles; remember your lower back as well.  Then when you are ready, start with top rope. It's generally very safe and the impact on your back is not high compared to lead climbing and bouldering. If it's possible, go with someone more experienced. Maybe jio your khakis from reddit?  Learn the proper techniques when you climb. It will be safe. Most common injuries are not actually spinal, at least from my experience, so don't worry and have fun!"

singapore,3cj5k3,soulslicer0,3,Wed Jul 8 09:09:39 2015 UTC,"I notice many who are unable to secure a local place seem to easily secure a place in Australian universities. This is certainly not the case with European (eg. TUM) and most certainly American universities (eg. UC Schools) and Asian one's too (eg. HKUST, Tsinghua)   First of all, I know plenty of people who have gone to pursue American and European education, almost as many as Australia. While I've gone down the Aussie path, my brother simply applied to a few UK unis after his poly and NS and was accepted to one in England. I don't think there are any differences in difficulty of applying to US vs Aus vs Europe, especially with the help of agencies.  Where students choose to go depends on personal preference, how much travelling you can put up with (Australia is the closest in distance and this is a big reason for more ppl choosing Aus), and the costs involved.   Are Australian degrees easy to get?   To answer your main question, short version: yes and no. Long version: You CANNOT generalise by country for ease of degree, OR cost of the degree itself.  The choice of degree, I feel, is the biggest determinant on difficulty. Medicine > Hospitality, to give extreme examples. For cost, to give my uni as an example, a medicine degree costs about 20,000 more PER YEAR than most other degrees.   Another important factor is the uni itself. I'm studying in a public university in Australia, and I have heard, just like back home, that certain private universities in my state have reputations for being more relaxed and easier. If there is any truth to those reputations, it likely is NOT consistent across all the courses they offer. There are just too many factors at play. Conversely, if you are accepted into Oxford, you will probably have a tougher time than in University of <Random Unknown State>.  In terms of cost, while my public uni studies are not cheap, it's cheaper than private universities here.  I haven't graduated yet, so I can't answer your question about job ops. :("
singapore,3cj5k3,Cataplexic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:01:06 2015 UTC,thanks for your answer. interesting points. there just seems to be this stigma around aussie uni's somehow and i wanted to clear it up

singapore,3cj5k3,Syptryn,3,Wed Jul 8 15:10:17 2015 UTC,"Second tier Australian Universities (any not in the Group of 8, especially those that place ads all over the MRT) look at international students as a source of money. Rule of thumb is  If its easy to get in, its probably not that great.  Ultimately it depends what program you go into. Generally, the ones that are marketed towards people who want to get jobs (Tourism, Accounting, Business...) are degree mills. Traditionalist majors (hard sciences, mathematics) will have respectable degrees - especially from places like ANU, Uni Melb, Uni Queensland etc."
singapore,3cj5k3,iomur,8,Wed Jul 8 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"You've a grave misconception of what exactly constitutes a degree mill. A degree mill is an unaccredited institution, which awards degrees without any form of real academic assessment and accepts things such as ""life experience"" as course credit. While there is no doubt that such ""institutions"" exist in Australia, every university you can find on this list http://www.australianuniversities.com.au/rankings/ are public institutions with government funding and regulations, these are the universities that Singaporeans typically attend. Most professional courses are regulated by professional governing bodies e.g. Accounting-CPA Australia, Veterinary Sciences-Australian Veterinary Association.   My point is that, students of these universities have worked hard for their degrees and to label their universities ""degree mills"" is frankly quite insulting. However, I do not disagree that there are different standards between universities, of course there are, but we should not discount the fact that these students, all of them, had to attend lectures, complete assignments and sit for exams, typically for three or more years.

Irregardless of degree, and G8 or not, they make more money off international students because the locals are subsidised and price-controlled.   Anyway, in my degree, I'm unhappy because they blatantly try to fail students, since they took in too many students, both local and international - if you fail a course, you must re-do it. There are no electives to make up credit, so failing means you are kicked back a year, just like secondary sch.   They do this by make the exams harder than previous years and making random shit examinable. 2 years ago, there was one exam where almost 1/3 of my cohort failed, and were held back. And, of course, you have to cough up another 8000 to re-do a course!   There a reason why there's an education glut. Everyone wants their kids to go to uni, course then they'll get a good job.

singapore,3ceohj,flyingfudge,3,Tue Jul 7 13:57:51 2015 UTC,The point is that PM should account for use of state resources on personal matters. I'm sure going on holiday he just pays out of own personal pocket. Does he pay out of own personal pocket when civil servants are writing letters in support of his case? He's very clear on the fact that he is suing Roy in a personal capacity.
singapore,3ceohj,daveonhols,5,Tue Jul 7 14:21:54 2015 UTC,"There is no need for litmus test. He shouldn't use State resources for private business at all. It should be obvious why...  Generally we don't need to bother asking this type of question because we trust that PM is not stupid and knows why this is a problem. Also we suppose that there are auditors to make sure State resources are used on the right stuff and not the wrong stuff.  The problem here is that state resources have quite clearly been used, since his secretary wrote a letter that was published in overseas media. So now the need for PM to explain is pretty clear cut."

singapore,3ceohj,NEWater,3,Tue Jul 7 23:03:38 2015 UTC,"it is a valid question, but seriously, with the PM's pay, is there any doubt that he can foot the legal fees? (just to be clear, I am not making an endorsement of the PM's pay - I do think it is excessive) More importantly, with such close scrutiny, it seems unlikely that he would make as basic an error as conflating state and personal resources for his suit.  as for whether the suit compromises his official duties, well, everyone is entitled to personal leave, even ministers, and I am assuming that the PM took personal leave to attend to said matters. everyone has the right to seek justice in the courts as a fundamental component of the rule of law (regardless of how busy you are) - even the prime minister. So yes, while the RP has the right to ask that question, I seriously doubt that the PM would not have considered these (fairly obvious) considerations beforehand"

singapore,3cdq1i,Locnil,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:17:46 2015 UTC,Nothing like the minority report. Big data can't catch criminals before they commit a crime lol.   But what it can do is identify which areas are more prevalent in crime at which times of the year. So more police can be sent to patrol those areas to reduce crime. Big data simply helps with manpower distribution to areas whereby police presence would be required the most.
singapore,3cdq1i,damjancd,2,Tue Jul 7 05:47:45 2015 UTC,"Big data typically identify trends, instead of individual acts, yes. But as was covered in one of the Freakonomics books, certain groups, like potential terrorists, do tend to fall outside of the norm in key trends. Someone who doesn't buy life insurance, buys large amounts of fertiliser without reason, makes bank transactions at certain times and has just quit his job abruptly has a high chance of being a suicide bomber. In the UK, they managed to use big data to narrow it down to 30 highly probable suspects, and police observation was then apparently able to foil a plot in the making. For certain criminal fringe groups, big data can in fact help with identifying potential members, though by itself it doesn't prove anything."

Quality is still fantastic though, many times quite usable, even in professional settings (if you know how to get around the obstacles)  I did a lot of research into this and bought a Panasonic 30x TZ60 because of it's RAW ability but it turns out, unless you have a tripod and want to click the button 50 times to get the same picture at high noise (for median blending), you are kind of fucked when it's even slightly not middle of the day.

singapore,3cf7wl,choonggg,2,Wed Jul 8 00:37:29 2015 UTC,"Get fit. NS is one of the best places to create a solid healthy lifestyle that will save and serve you for the rest of your life. Starting when you're in your late 20s is often difficult because of inertia and many guys then have already given up. In army you will always find that gymhead chiongster who will be more than enthusiastic to have a workout buddy.  Prep for life in the real world. Start reading non-fiction books worthy of your time. It should be regarding philosophy, sociology, economics, business or whatever you may want to do in the future.   If you're going to university, start looking at your course syllabus and planning ahead. I'm not saying to study in advance, but get an idea of what the course would entail and begin learning more about it. E.g. If you wanna be a banker, you can begin reading finance guidebooks and learning basic modeling. If you're looking to be a entrepreneur, coding is important but so is understanding business model and the startup scene in Asia.   Create new habits, and use them to replace old and useless ones. It could be excessive facebooking or buzzfeeding which are often brain-wasters, or even cutting down on excessive drinking/smoking.   Finally as a comment regarding coding: Having had some exposure to startup scene and VC, I've seen a TON of people say they ""want to learn coding"" and giving up 2 hours into codingacademy. This is like fat people resolving to ""get fit"" every New Year. It's a lot of work and it's like learning photoshop where photoshop manuals are pointless. Instead, you need to pick a pet project and use/google techniques to trial-and-error your way to the end.  I suggest you do some testing and find if it's to your taste. It would suck to have a grand plan to master coding while in NS and getting demoralized when you absolutely hate it. Sorry if it's a bit naggy, but if you're still saying ""planning to learn some sort of coding language"" I'd assume you haven't even picked a language yet and thus it's still unexplored territory for you.

I've faced racism before but I've never been blocked and silenced by Chinese Singaporeans or White British because of my views on race, only by SJWs who claim to speak up because I need their protection.

The fact that you're using tumblr. The ones who are truly disadvantaged have no time or resources to scroll through tumblr and contribute to the page. Its isolated to just one economic class of people and it is by no means a representation of those who have been truly sidelined in society. Your 'conversation' on tumblr is totally inaccessible to those whom we actually need to start helping.  So in effect, all you get is a bunch of already very privileged people complaining that someone else is more advantaged than them.   Yes, being told racist jokes hurt.

singapore,3cegvp,dtwn,2,Wed Jul 8 03:11:55 2015 UTC,"Probably referring to how people expect Singlish rather than English in more casual social situations, and also that their understanding of Singlish often involves heavy use of Mandarin/Hokkien terminology.  In such a situation, a non-Chinese may well feel that he/she is effectively being expected to use some Chinese to communicate. Hence, Chinese privilege."
singapore,3cegvp,oklos,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:39:32 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I just think it's a bit of a stretch, seeing as to how a command of Singlish also requires a decent colloquial knowledge of certain Malay terms.

singapore,3cegvp,dtwn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:52:33 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem is that there are effectively different 'levels' or 'versions' of Singlish. In some cases, it may skew much more heavily towards Hokkien or Mandarin."

What welfare? Im sorry, unless you have actual evidence and proof of such welfare, then I disagree. Im a Malay and I've never tasted welfare. The ONE and ONLY thing low-income Malays get over other races that is of any tangible benefit is the Mendaki Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy. This covers tuition fees for low-income students in local universities. It was implemented to improve malay representation in local universities because Malays are still under-represented in higher education. Unlike in the west where they have Affirmative Action policies for minorities. The funds also come from Malays in Singapore. Working Malays have to contribute to Mendaki on a monthly basis. If you feel sad, you can apply for Navy or Air Force. Then at least you wont have to see any Malays around."

After the IPO of Alibaba in September 2014, Temasek monetised around 10 per cent of its long-held stake. It fully exited Mosaic, Cloudary, Kunlun Energy and Medreich.   It seems they have been locking in profits, also they were probably in the Chinese market way before this crazy run up. Who knows what they've been doing in the past 3 months (a wise fund manager would slowly divest on the way up to prevent over-exposure), so IMO it's not a big deal.

It's not like we're an uncivilised third world country executing a kid for being stupid, we're simply punishing a guy for pissing everyone off. 4 weeks in jail might seem harsh but in the whole picture of things, he didn't really lost any significant portion of his life. The real punishment is the record he now has, which I highly believe is deserved for his arrogance and insensitivity.  People are comparing us to North Korea when in reality I'm actually more afraid to live in America than I am over here. If the cost of living in Singapore was much lower, I'd even call this place a paradise. You hear all kinds of bad things living in America like student loans and expensive healthcare and corrupted government whereas education in Singapore is highly subsidised and greatly affordable for everyone. Healthcare can be expensive but it's also still affordable. I can never know how corrupted government officials can be in any country, but even if there are any in Singapore, it's definitely not to the point where we can feel the effects of their corruption.  Even young ladies walking alone at night in any dark alley in Singapore wearing skimpy clothing probably wouldn't even feel scared. Crime does happen in Singapore, nobody would deny that, but it's on the scale where we still do not need to worry much about it. Whereas there's so much news about gun violence or dangerous cops even in the good neighbourhoods of the US. The fact that a distinction between good and bad neighbourhoods even exists is worrying.  You can come to Singapore with 0 knowledge about the place and you can do mostly anything you want wherever you want granted you have the $$$. Go to the US and you have to do research about where you're visiting and common scams and tourist traps found there. Seems to me like Singapore more fittingly embodies the phrase ""land of the free"".  It's not like Singapore's numerous laws require a profound understanding if you wish to visit or even live here. A general rule of thumb is just don't be an asshole or do asshole things and nobody will look at you twice. I think that's pretty much true worldwide and not just in Singapore, but it's something Amos Yee doesn't grasp the concept of and is something people in /r/worldnews greatly disagree with because they hold the mindset that ""free speech"" is a free pass to be an asshole.  /rant"

singapore,3ccpz2,NXMT,22,Tue Jul 7 03:41:54 2015 UTC,The level of hate of Singlish here is so bizarre considering almost all of us here are born and bred Singaporean from birth. You've never had the occasional casual Singlish thrown here and there in a casual setting when conversing with friends and family? Or does your level of English have to be so immpeccable and perfect all the time? I'm almost tempted to tip my fedora.
singapore,3ccpz2,wojar,15,Mon Jul 6 23:23:56 2015 UTC,"i use Singlish when i'm talking to friends or family. but i cringed when i see companies using Singlish on social media as a way of communicating (i'm talking about you Scoot).   edit: speaking Singlish is really different from typing it. when you speak in Singlish, it's almost instinctive. but when you're typing, it goes through a thought-process and you're able to control it. makes sense?"
singapore,3ccpz2,konadora,13,Tue Jul 7 04:47:12 2015 UTC,"I'm a Korean who just only got my citizenship this year (yay) after living here for 19 years (and yes I served my NS too :p), gotta say that I really love Singlish. Not to say that it is appropriate to use at all times, but I just love how the language is actually more detailed and specific than it is. It took me up till Sec 4 to fully understand and utilize Singlish (or maybe it was NS LOL), because one does not simply put ""lah"" at the end of any sentence to make it Singlish. In a way, it is a beautiful language (dialect?) on its own."
singapore,3ccpz2,tehokosong,7,Tue Jul 7 00:57:01 2015 UTC,Korea also has it's regional dialects too right? It's sort of similar.
singapore,3ccpz2,konadora,10,Tue Jul 7 01:43:35 2015 UTC,"Yep correct! For example, I have a hard time understanding my relatives from Pusan because they have a very slurry accent, and they use different words and expressions. It's pretty unique to Pusan people haha. But theirs is more of just words being changed to suit the local demographic, not an entire language system like Singlish."
singapore,3ccpz2,shqippotato,12,Tue Jul 7 03:34:33 2015 UTC,The language sounds absolutely horrible but I love Singlish. It's one of the few things that constitutes our national identity. I can't speak Chinese for nuts but 100% can into Singlish

singapore,3ccpz2,NHL_mumps,5,Tue Jul 7 00:59:46 2015 UTC,Tbh I love Singlish but I would want to poke my eyes out if my friends typed like HWZ. I like it in speech and text. Short forms not so much.

singapore,3ccpz2,tsukuruu,8,Tue Jul 7 03:36:36 2015 UTC,"You've never had the occasional casual Singlish thrown here and there in a casual setting when conversing with friends and family?   Depends on the context man. I suppose Singlish is very contextual - I'd usually turn on my Singlish just to get along with people whom I feel are cool with it. Army buddies - Singlish gao-gao. University professors - British English.  In fact, I do especially realise that online Singaporeans tend to be hostile when someone uses non-standard english, like ayyy LOL IRL. Experienced that hostility on the Fabrications Against the PAP Facebook page, which brings me to...   Or does your level of English have to be so immpeccable and perfect all the time?   I realise that when the local folks here think that they have impeccable English, in reality they don't. I know someone who is particular of all the grammatical errors, but she speaks like one coming from a Chinese-ed school. Then again, it can be argued that there is no absolutes in the mastery of a language, especially when there are creole variations of the English language (i.e. Essex). You just need to be understood, why so serious?"
singapore,3ccpz2,gydot,2,Tue Jul 7 01:50:59 2015 UTC,correct. different people different level of singlish.
singapore,3ccpz2,pkismeyea,16,Tue Jul 7 05:31:29 2015 UTC,maybe they think singlish = low crass/peasant-speak?
singapore,3ccpz2,guoshe,3,Mon Jul 6 23:38:31 2015 UTC,"true. from a sociolinguistics perspective, Singlish (vis-a-vis Standard Singapore English) is a low prestige dialect/variant on the continuum.   also everyone here seems to take the definition of Singlish for granted when it isn't. different people may have different points on the linguistic continuum in mind."
singapore,3ccpz2,gydot,2,Tue Jul 7 07:37:12 2015 UTC,"not really what, unless you from birth socioeconomic class up there one then maybe one might think so. otherwise everyone else speaks singlish."
singapore,3ccpz2,AbsurdGoat,6,Tue Jul 7 05:29:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's because Singlish's versatility is also a major hindrance on text. Singlish as a language is versatile and useful partially because of its ability to use the same words and few words to mean a variety of specific thing. The caveat is this relies on tone and inflection a lot, which doesn't convey well over text, leading to ambiguity.  Or people are just judgmental idk."
singapore,3ccpz2,gydot,2,Tue Jul 7 01:10:00 2015 UTC,just using the common singlish isms that most people use. it is hard to misconstrue the tone of the most common 20 phrases. until you start getting complicated with your multi hokkien + tamil + malay phrases where it may be harder to read/picture the tone.
singapore,3ccpz2,c_is_for_calvin,2,Tue Jul 7 05:30:40 2015 UTC,just means we're excellent at shorthand speech leh.
singapore,3ccpz2,c_is_for_calvin,5,Tue Jul 7 03:48:54 2015 UTC,it's the pinnacle of excellence when you can singlish and then speak perfect english just to troll. then continue to mish mash with multiple dialects.

singapore,3cdzhx,onionguy4,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:06:56 2015 UTC,"I've just learned a language in six months despite being very busy with work. About 100 hours of lessons. Was painful dragging myself to classes but I could never have learned this ""fast"" and understood this much if I tried learning by myself.   Structure in actual classes is REALLY good and important. It gives you strong basics/foundation and you understand the language better and are able to build on that understanding to learn new things more easily.  Some misconceptions - a phrasebook is not enough, if you can, go ahead and do a ten-week course first. Better to arrive in Japan and continue your lessons with a good start at least, rather than arrive and start from nothing, which is fine, but a good start with basics is better than nothing. The classes force you to learn and you WILL leave with at least some useful basics, how to introduce yourself, talk about yourself etc. plus it's fun!   I DO think you should grab the chance to speak as often as you can in front of your colleagues once you become friends with them. Anyone in their right mind would know you're learning a language and therefore are bound to make mistakes. The biggest issue for me was overcoming my embarrassment of being wrong in front of local speakers. Once I shamelessly got over that fear and embarrassment, I just speak it with all my mistakes. People help correct me sometimes but they definitely understand everything I said. But I didn't get there from being afraid to speak with anyone and just reading my textbook and talking to my teacher only, I had to speak it with local speakers."

Also, it wasn't the State which pressed charges - it was some 30 people or so, including his own mother.   I go with the stance that the treatment rather mismatched the crime. On the other hand, Yee had a penchant for flouting just about every other rule as well - he didn't give two hoots about probationary regulations and schedule, falsely accused his bailor of molest (a very serious accusation - he was extremely lucky the latter didn't press charges), wasted the media's time, and in general, was a giant douche.

There are a lot of misconceptions out there and people like Goh Meng Seng will use those misconceptions to sway the people. It's a scum move but it's effective against the uninformed. At worst the PAP will be forced to cite exactly how the case went and how they did not intervene in any way in Amos Yee's case.  From what I can see, if you think 2 steps ahead this Amos Yee's case can be used to PAP's advantage against the other parties if they aren't careful about how they bring forth their arguments. It's honestly better to let this case die.  That being said I'm more worried about Singapore's social condition right now, it seems that the almost total media silence has brought forth a generation full of passive-aggressive people.

Yee has practically ruined his entire life, and Ngerng will probably file for bankruptcy.  JBJ, on the other hand, was a viable opposition leader, and Mr Lee was rather power-hungry. I don't like to think of it, but that's how it was. He could've live and let live and continued to hold majority power by sheer charisma, but no, he really wanted to stay in power - and jailed JBJ, CST, etc.  Mr. Low Thia Khiang and the scrubs who are the opposition today can barely hold a candle to the opposition members of yesteryear."

You're in class doing a test, and the teacher accuses you of cheating (maybe peeking at a classmate)  however you have not cheated, and feel duly insulted and feel the accusation is arbitrary. The teacher knows he has no way of really proving that you peeked, so he says that he won't affect your test scores, but will note in your discipline record that you have behavior and discipline problems.  At this juncture will you feel that you've been treated unjustly? Will you not fight?  Young people often have an exceptional sense of justice and right and wrong. Many can't stand hypocritical situations and see things in black and white. To Amos this might be the case. He sees that the system is treating him unfairly; remember what Amos did was voice out his opinion but called for no concrete social action, albeit in a rude manner. What he got was 4 weeks of prison. I do not for the life of me believe this punishment fits the crime (I actually believe no amount of speech without a suggestion or call for action should ever be a crime)"

When we have to jail him for ranting is indicative of the fragility of our societal psyche.  That being said the problem lies not in any one individual or party since I think a large majority of our citizens agree with the terms of arraignment of Amos.  My concern is that far smarter kids than Amos, will clearly not try to express themselves in ways not expressly allowed.

A more accurate analogy: you cheated in the test and even admitted to doing so, but you argue that cheating shouldn't be a crime.   The analogy of cheating already presumes what he did was wrong. I would argue a better analogy likens to him indirectly asking the teacher which topics would be tested on in advance and the teacher inadvertently dropping helpful hints which the student picks up on. Does this count as cheating? That the student had an unfair advantage over people who did not receive similar info? Consider also that students in other schools routinely do this without any repercussions. See the grey area here?   People like yourself keep harping on this ""harsh"" sentence, while conveniently ignoring the fact that both the prosecution and judge wanted to give Amos probation, but he rejected it and even asked for a jail term[2] . That is the only reason why he was given a prison sentence.   As explained by others, Amos does not feel that what he did warrants punishment at all, be it probation or likewise. Come on, how can a country jail 16 year old kids for posting controversial Youtube videos? Did those videos lead to racial riots, religious spats? It's crazy to think that a country's prosecution arm can argue for jailing a 16 year old kid over remarks he made online. What is this? Ancient China where criticising the emperor lands you in jail?  Additionally, almost no one knew who Amos was before the media decide to widely publicise his posts and videos. Haters are going to hate.

singapore,3ca1fn,Cedosg,-3,Tue Jul 7 15:00:58 2015 UTC,"That was a clear cut assault case caught on multiple cameras in the mass media. It would have been impossible to not prosecute him and impose a stiff punishment.   I'm talking about Jason Neo  and Anton Casey. Why were charges of sedition not brought against them? Is it as Amos says, that he is charged because these guys have lost their job or suffered other consequences, but he has no job or anything to lose and therefore this is the only way to punish him?   That's selective prosecution and using the law as a punishment tool which should not be the case. And why now suddenly turn the sentence around because he ""shows remorse""?"
singapore,3ca1fn,onionguy4,7,Mon Jul 6 15:30:41 2015 UTC,"It's easy.   Because both Jason Neo and Anton Casey provided a public apology no matter how disingenuous it may have been.  Amos was afforded an opportunity for probation and to apologize and even retract his video.   He didn't comply.  tl;dr: Those you mentioned made a remedy of the situation that was presented by issuing a public apology. Amos was also afforded the opportunity, he just didn't take it. So there's a legal consequence to not complying."
singapore,3ca1fn,Cedosg,-5,Mon Jul 6 16:07:30 2015 UTC,So why should he have to apologize and retract his video. Because Christians were hurt?   The level of hurt can't be compared to the other guys at all. He barely even got 20 comments on the original video. And the judge also determined that he was a nobody. In fact if not for the charges the vast majority of people would not give a shit about the kid's rantings.   Let's face it a huge number of Singaporeans are racist/religiousist even though they are outwardly tolerant. I don't feel that his rantings were any more seditious than the anti Christian/Muslim/etc ones on HWZ/sammyboy/reddit.  He was just unlucky that his went viral.

Nobody rioted over such comments. People are capable of seeing criticism without forming riots, and the leader himself felt free enough to make such comments.

You can't just quietly piggy back those on to another charge, that's not how the law should work.   SRSR333's comment was a bit inaccurate, but the gist is there. Amos didn't break more laws, but he broke the terms of his bail on purpose, and that's why he went back into remand. He also rejected probation and explicitly asked for a jail term.   And you seem to be missing the point of civil disobedience, if he cared about not disregarding the rules he wouldn't have posted the video in the first place.   And you seem to be missing the point that civil disobedience doesn't magically make you immune from laws or consequences. Amos is simply facing the legal consequences of his actions."

Amos is simply facing the legal consequences of his actions.   Imagine a school bully goes up to a kid and says ""give me all your lunch money or I'll beat you up."" The kid says that's bullshit, I won't do that. The bully proceeds to beat the kid up.   What you're saying is basically the bully did nothing wrong, the kid turned down the offer from the bully when he offered to take only half the lunch money. The kid knew the consequences of not giving the bully his money so he deserved the beating.   Now you may disagree that the law is unjust, you may argue that the law is required. At least then you would be making a proper argument. But the bullshit about how Amos deserves it because he's a dick or was disobedient is just rubbish."

His parents told him to apologize but he didn't want to. His parents gave a warning and he disregarded the warning.   He even accused this kid of licking his face when all the kid did was gave this bully some coins to buy a soda so that he can play nice. But hey, that kid definitely deserved the shove on the floor, right?   Now he is also saying it's not wrong to bully people and he shouldn't have been punished for bullying those stupid kids.   The parents with the private playground down the road is now protesting that the bully should not be spanked because he should have the freedom to bully whoever he wants because they didn't give their children a rule not to bully kids."
singapore,3ca1fn,Cedosg,9,Mon Jul 6 08:58:17 2015 UTC,Worst analogy ever. The laws are there in order to prevent people from inciting violence from religious and racial grounds. But he did it anyway. In fact if he left out the part about Christianity he wouldn't have been charged at all.

There were people on the road, fighting to get into buses, old being pushed, people in the gap between bus and the pedestrian path even as buses were moving. At one point due to buildup of buses the intersection got jammed, and the pedestrian signal went Green, people started crossing dodging buses and other vehicles on the road even as the traffic on the side is moving. I think we are lucky that there hasn't been an injury reported. It's not a big thing to see such a scene in other less developed countries, but problem is that in Singapore we are not used to this and it can become overwhelming."

If the file was accidentally deleted, you can try file recovery software like Recuva which can take a long time depending on how big your harddisk is. Also, it would be better to put the harddisk into another computer and run the recovery software there so that you don't write any data onto the harddisk you want to recover data from.  If the harddisk cannot spin up, you will need to engage professionals who will open it up and scan the data on the disk platters and put them onto a separate harddisk for you. Most expensive option.

singapore,3can84,Land-strider,28,Mon Jul 6 12:29:21 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference will be your peers. The top JCs will have people who are more motivated/smart. This can either motivate you or stress you out. The school will force you to retain, make you take 4 H2, drop subjects etc  The lower ranked JCs are more chilled out. I am not saying that they are lousy. Certainly not, i would know. But the yeah it is more of a ""Do the best you can"" instead of ""You must be the best"" This can also cut both ways. You keep calm and study well or you slack off.  You have to decide what is better for you. Distance is huge thing for JC. You will have to stay back a lot. Especially for PW and stuff. Try to find one nearer to you. But if want a particular JC then go for it.   My friend who lives in Yishun went to MJC because he wanted the name. But he came out well so..."
singapore,3can84,snowcroc,18,Mon Jul 6 12:52:55 2015 UTC,My friend who lives in Yishun went to MJC because he wanted the name   LOL who goes to MJC for the name?

singapore,3can84,snowcroc,3,Mon Jul 6 13:10:07 2015 UTC,"So... what? Go on  But all things considering, a lot of my teachers said I will thrive in VJ. I am ridiculously (outmatched? Is that the word for it? Like the difference between me and second position is stupidly high) in my neighbourhood secondary school. I feel that I would be able to cope. The main factor I'm worried about is travel time. If it is really important, I might settle for NYJC  Thank you for your input"
singapore,3can84,snowcroc,10,Mon Jul 6 13:03:56 2015 UTC,"Dude no one is asking you to settle. For now just focus on your o levels. You will have plenty of time to choose later.   That said. It is different for everybody. Are you planning to be active in council/house cheer/sports etc. If so this will consume a lot of your time. But some people manage it.  If you just plan to study. The distance should not be a problem. If your teachers think you can do well, they may be right as in you will be able to handle the academic stuff.   If your dream is VJ then go for VJ. No use being is NY thinking about VJ. But take your time. Go for open houses. Talk to alumni."
singapore,3can84,gnomesrome,4,Mon Jul 6 13:26:10 2015 UTC,"a lot of my teachers said I will thrive in VJ. I am ridiculously (outmatched? Is that the word for it? Like the difference between me and second position is stupidly high) in my neighbourhood secondary school. I feel that I would be able to cope.   Contrary to some of the opinions here, I feel that VJ will be a better choice for you, based on what you said above. It will challenge you and let you grow. Like /u/snowcroc said, your peers will influence you. Teachers, too. I may be generalizing, but I have a better opinion of VJ than NYJC (since you have presented us with these two choices).  On the bright side, you'll only be commuting a long(er) distance for two years. What I can suggest is that you rest/try to get some shut-eye while traveling. Also, it's a good option to travel back home during off-peak periods so you don't have to squeeze with people, etc. It may seem like a minor point, but I find that this helps. I have traveled a lot for JC, Uni and internships - not dead yet ;)"
singapore,3can84,gnomesrome,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:19:34 2015 UTC,Thanks. I guess mainly what I'm looking for is different opinions.  Will the benefit of VJ outweigh the cost of the huge travel time.. everyday
singapore,3can84,snowcroc,3,Mon Jul 6 13:26:58 2015 UTC,"Will the benefit of VJ outweigh the cost of the huge travel time.. everyday   That is up to you :) For now, study hard and score well so you can have a happy dilemma later on."
singapore,3can84,Thorberry,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:30:52 2015 UTC,There is no inherent benefit to VJ. Whatever JC you have to do your. Quality of teachers will be the same. Quality of papers will be the same.   Its the environment. If you belief VJ will make you a great student. It will only be becuase that belief motivates you
singapore,3can84,Thorberry,6,Mon Jul 6 13:33:52 2015 UTC,"This isn't correct. The top JCs attract some of the best tutors, who will craft their teaching material differently because their students are expected to be more clever. This is especially true for the humanities subjects because there is barely a national curriculum to follow, only broad themes and topics.  There's also the matter of resources -- at my JC (better than NY, worse than VJ), there was a grand total of three tutors in one of my subject's departments. They were crazy overworked and most of them have left the JC now. The top JCs generally have more resources to work with, although I don't know where it comes from.  Quality of other students matter a lot too. If you might ever want to study in groups, it is much more difficult when you're at a disparate standard from your peers."
singapore,3can84,ceddya,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:28:08 2015 UTC,Yeah. By benefit of VJ I meant the atmosphere
singapore,3can84,SRSR333,4,Mon Jul 6 13:35:07 2015 UTC,"I think there's enough difference between VJC and NYJC for you to do the long-distance traveling. I did it thru my JC years -- you can definitely get by with good planning of time. Catch a nap and do last-minute homework on trains/buses, don't spend too much time surfing the net etc."
singapore,3can84,gnomesrome,4,Mon Jul 6 14:44:55 2015 UTC,"The neighbourhood JCs have their fair share of top students who should be sufficient benchmarks for you to push yourself against. I really don't think it makes a big difference in terms of motivation if you're already self-motivated. In terms of stress though, I can certainly see a difference because there will be a much greater number of top students surrounding you.  If you're looking for value-addedness though, I would avoid neighbourhood JCs unless you're very personally resourceful. The top JCs tend to provide their students with more out of syllabus content - things like a greater push to take H3s, more training for the various Olympiads and even greater help with applications to international universities (i.e. SAT, BMAT). Heck, I know RJC arranged for their J1 students to shadow doctors at NUH while I had to contact NUH and set it up myself. Anyway, these are the things that can make a difference when it comes to applying for the top unis or the very competitive courses, so keep that in mind."
singapore,3can84,SRSR333,0,Mon Jul 6 16:34:13 2015 UTC,Dunno leh - SRJC's promo and CT1/2 papers are damn difficult.
singapore,3can84,gnomesrome,10,Mon Jul 6 12:57:12 2015 UTC,"Papers being difficult is one thing, questions being relevant is another thing.  Papers also aren't necessarily representative of a school's ability in other aspects..."
singapore,3can84,SRSR333,-1,Mon Jul 6 13:04:01 2015 UTC,Just saying.
singapore,3can84,HnNaldoR,9,Mon Jul 6 13:08:14 2015 UTC,"Lol. I'm also just saying. Have done papers from all schools, finished my A levels. I just find that some JCs set their papers of a difficulty that isn't realistic. And not as if their students do well (internally and externally)..."
singapore,3can84,snowcroc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:14:19 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I was sure as heck surprised their papers are so difficult...
singapore,3can84,AstherFenix,2,Mon Jul 6 13:20:15 2015 UTC,Some schools make their paper hard so students study hard after prelims.
singapore,3can84,hotdogexplosion,3,Mon Jul 6 13:40:09 2015 UTC,And YJC's maths papers are known to put the fear of god in students. Means nothing though
singapore,3can84,summer_petrichor,12,Mon Jul 6 13:08:18 2015 UTC,My Sec 4 form teacher advised us all to go VJ cause they had the shortest skirts.
singapore,3can84,salientlife93,7,Mon Jul 6 16:51:30 2015 UTC,NYJC seems like a very good choice they start school at 8.30 3 days a week and 9 for the remaining 2 but they end quite late (5+) VJC has an extremely strong school culture and produce consistently good A level results. Even though the commute to school is very long you can maybe sleep during the commute or study One mistake you can make when you choose a jc is choosing it because your friends are going there. DONT let your friends choices be a major reason. This is because you guys will most likely be in different classes and wont see each other often in school.  If i were you I would choose VJC
singapore,3can84,doombringer50,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:34:40 2015 UTC,"I need to note something: the starting times for NYJC is really dependent on your timetable. If you get a timetable with many 'supplementary' (but obligatory) lessons that starts in the morning, like 7:30am, then sucks for you. Don't go and think that you'll definitely only get to start school at 8:30/9am for two years there."
singapore,3can84,gyrfalcons,6,Tue Jul 7 08:51:44 2015 UTC,"I was from VJC. Firstly, I must caution you that distance is really a huge deal of a factor, it may not seem that bad at first but the hours will stack and it will take a toll on you eventually. Will you have the determination and discipline to complete your tutorials and revise after the long travelling time? I think you'd have to consider that carefully before coming to a decision. What I did was I read my notes on the MRT back, or stayed in school till late nights to revise with my friends.  As for VJC, the sports culture is flourishing, school spirit is generally extremely strong and cohesive, and the folks there are no slouches in academia either. You'll be meeting people who are fiercely determined to go into medicine, law and other distinguished fields, people who want nothing less than 3 As, 4 As, or even 90 rank points for their A levels. It is a very competitive environment and it brings out the best and worst in people that you will meet, but it is a good stepping stone and precursor to what entails later in life.  As for staff, I met the best teacher in my life in JC and suffice to say, I had never once believed that teachers could make a difference on me if not for her, and she changed my life at one of the most critical turning points, when I was going through a very deep depression phase. If you are into CCAs, leadership roles, and don't mind the arguably greater academic pressure as compared to possibly NYJC, VJC is the place for you. Ultimately though, if you don't go the extra mile and study hard, I guarantee that you will flop A levels. Don't ever harbour the complacent mindset that being in an elite JC means that you will ace the A levels, my friend did and he was brought down to earth pretty hard. Your peers and tutors can only help you that much, most of the  motivation has to come from within. If you can live up to the relentless attitude and spirit epitomised by the school's motto, ''nil sine labore'' or nothing without labour, you can be sure that you will excel regardless if which JC you go to, and regardless of wherever you go long after the A levels have ended. And that is something that will carry you forwards for the rest of your life."

singapore,3can84,SRSR333,3,Wed Jul 8 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"Culture is a big thing for JCs, even if it's only two years. I don't know about now, but some JCs are VERY heavy on feeder schools and if you're not from that background or used to how it is, it can be a huge fucking surprise. And not a pleasant one. I speak from my own experience here- went to ACJC after first three months, had never been in that kind of place before, was completely blindsided by the whole religion thing. Yeah, I did expect some, but not to the extent that it was...   I mean, I don't think it's a bad school per se, but it's definitely not for everyone. I've also heard from a lot of people I went to uni with that they had similar adjustment issues coming from different backgrounds. Especially with 'top' JCs like Hwach and RJ that the majority of kids feed in from the associated secondary schools, finding a place for yourself where you can feel comfortable when literally everyone around you has known each other for the past four years or so can be murder.   I'd say for NYJC and VJC you shouldn't have too much of a problem with that though. I know people who have gone to both, they're good places. All things considered it's not too big a deal and you should just go to the one you feel more comfortable with, environment wise."
singapore,3can84,jetonator,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:25:27 2015 UTC,Damn. I love the ACJC culture tho I'm not christian (Buddhist lol). Culture is something that can really make or break your JC experience IMO
singapore,3can84,Thorberry,8,Wed Jul 8 00:22:32 2015 UTC,"VJ is ridiculously far away from Yishun - it can take up to an hour and a half to get there solely by public transport. The fastest route: Yishun MRT to Bishan, transfer to Circle Line, get off at Paya Lebar (or MacPherson/Dakota) then take one of several busses (43, 135, a few more) to VJ. A very long route. I assure you there are equally good or better JCs much closer to you.   Also take your current L1R5 into consideration. If you're already getting single digits for your L1R5 and several A1s/A2s in your school's internal exams, you'll probably get 6-8 points (if you work consistently) easily in the actual 'O' levels. Remove 2-4 points for CCA performance and Higher Mother Tongue, and you're well in the territory of getting into RJ/HCI.  SRJC, NJC and NYJC are very decent choices. You might consider throwing SAJC into the mix as well."
singapore,3can84,nckb,5,Mon Jul 6 12:40:19 2015 UTC,"Seconding this, trust me, distance may not seem like much of an issue right now when you're not commuting there every single day, but it quickly becomes the siannest parts of each day and one of the largest wastes of time (cos you definitely won't be doing anything productive when crammed on public transport). And VJC is already relatively intense when it comes to academic expectations.  I'd choose NYJC if I were you, I've heard good things about it, the culture seems good and their results are also decent. Of course if you can aim for RI then do it since its closer to Yishun, but RI really isn't for everyone."
singapore,3can84,banyt,4,Mon Jul 6 13:07:47 2015 UTC,"I commuted 1h 10min everyday for JC, it sucked ass but it's not insurmountable.  If he can choose NJC, of course he should just choose it instead. RI and HCI are in their own league, VJC/NJC/VJC/A few others follow very closely, and everything else is a bit of a mishmash.  I agree with whoever said it that the biggest difference is school culture. Being a big fish in a small pond is nice for your self-confidence but gets old very quickly."
singapore,3can84,tjhan,3,Mon Jul 6 14:49:17 2015 UTC,"What CCA and activities are you planning to pick up in JC? If it's going to be time-intensive (e.g. sports, performing arts), then you are probably better off going to a JC that is nearer to you. Reaching home on a tiring CCA day after 9:30pm can really impose a toll on you and your academics.  Otherwise, go for the academically superior JC (VJ). The learning environment there is definitely superior and can play a huge role in your academic performance. VJ produces good results consistently (top 4?) unlike NY. Sure, you can score 90 rank points in NY but it would be much easier in an environment like VJ's.  If you're looking for a combination of both, then go to AJ. Better academics than NY and really close to Yishun. Doesn't have a campus as swanky as NY's but you're there for only 2 years.  All the best for your O levels!"
singapore,3can84,very_fierce,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:32:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you!    I pass by AJC everyday on my way to school. Every time I look at it it just seems so... cheap? (I'm sorry)      I'm interested to know. Anyone who chose AJC over something else, what are your thoughts? How is the school from the inside?"
singapore,3can84,very_fierce,2,Mon Jul 6 22:34:16 2015 UTC,"I was from AJC a few years ago (I'm a rising 4th year in NUS now)  the facilities do suck, but they are better now than when I was there. yes, it doesn't look very nice, but everything is more or less serviceable.  the school doesn't really cater to unique subject combinations. if you're just intending to take something common like PCME (I did), then that's fine. stuff like Chinese Literature, on the other hand...  your fellow students will not be very intelligent, creative, or driven, if they are like my batch. almost none will get into the highly-contested university courses. they will tend not to participate in interesting extra-curricular events.  the school itself provides plenty of opportunities. this means that if you are intelligent, creative and driven, the lion's share of those opportunities can and will fall to you, and you will pull ahead easily. that is the benefit of being a big fish in a small pond.  in-house exams are fairly difficult for the average person. when I was in J2, most subjects had something like 50% Us. that means that if you are planning to go to an overseas university you will need to do exceptionally well (admissions may be using your preliminary examinations' results)  my tutors were quite good, I think. but I'm different.  if you want to know anything else, feel free to ask"
singapore,3can84,shxwn,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:39:03 2015 UTC,"My wife was from AJ and it seemed fine. Like there were smart ppl there, the uni acceptance rate was pretty high. But NJ should be better for you I think."

If you go VJC, your friends will tend to turn out to be doctors, lawyers, etc. NYJC? Engineers, govt workers.   It's a harsh fact. You will be there 2 years, suck it up with the travel time. Go VJC, it's a no-brainer if you want a better life in your adult life. Choose NYJC for an easier 2 years now."

singapore,3can84,xhienider,3,Tue Jul 7 01:46:36 2015 UTC,"another thing to consider is, what do you want to be in the future? it will be important because you have to choose the topics in JC. For example, you need double sciences to get into NUS Meds, Physics for Engineering, Maths for IT, GP for Law.   Start with a goal (which uni course) in mind, and the rest will be easier to plan for. If travelling time is a real concern, you can consider renting or staying with a relative. Personally, I stayed with my uncle for a few months for my A levels. What I am saying is, don't let the little things affect you. Eyes on the prize, go VJC, make friends, study hard, play hard and get into the Uni Course you want."

singapore,3can84,resurrexia,2,Mon Jul 6 17:27:35 2015 UTC,"My bro was from NY while I'm from VJ! Hahah.. theres so many gd responses from everyone. I stay in Serangoon so its pretty darn far travelling to school yes, it gets tiring and all but if you are motivated its definitely worth going to VJ. School culture is good and sports/performing arts CCAs are active and doing well, you can make many friends, and most people are studious but not so crazy like RI or HC though, so it wasn't too crazy. But yeah lessons can drag to 4pm or so, and CCAs to 6-7pm so it might be kinda tiring. I survived through though, joined Bowling and had trainings at Yishun till 8pm, reached home at 9pm and quickly did my homework before I crashed hahah.     If you're aiming for more I would say VJ, but if you feel that you would struggle in JC (which is a lot harder!) and be just focused on academics I think NYJC is a good school too, they have been on the rise and the most important thing is whether you are motivated to study or enjoy/achieve in your CCAs. My brother was from NY and hes doing well now too, entered uni although his A levels werent fantastic but I could see he enjoyed his time in NY.     Feel free to ask me anything!"
singapore,3can84,fuwafuwayui,2,Tue Jul 7 04:55:35 2015 UTC,"I used to travel from Sembawang to VJC. I would actually take 858 from Khatib MRT to the bridge just before the Changi Airport and switch to 36 on the opposite side. On a good day it is only a 45 min journey.   As for which to choose, since I'm a VS VJ boy, my answer is going to be very biased. (VJC of course)  Do feel free to ask questions on the travel time or my experiences. Even though that was 17 years ago for me."
singapore,3can84,thehf45,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:18:31 2015 UTC,Could you elaborate on the travel part. I had always thought buses took longer
singapore,3can84,junnir,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:22:59 2015 UTC,"Sure! 858 will actually take the expressway CTE - TPE - ECP if I recall correctly hence during early hours in the morning around 6:10, the traffic isn't that heavy and it's pretty smooth sailing 30 mins to airport. I notice now that there is a small stop in between at Seletar but I am not sure how it will change the timings.   Then 36 is just 10 - 15 mins ride from the airport to VJC.   I am unsure why this route doesn't show up in Gothere.sg. Maybe someone who frequents this route can chime in on whether the routes are still accurate. Haha."
singapore,3can84,dappercroe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:49:02 2015 UTC,Thank you for the info. If it is really that way then it makes for a very strong case for VJ
singapore,3can84,Stealthstriker,2,Tue Jul 7 10:23:30 2015 UTC,"Just to also put in some of my non academic related experiences in VJ that you might want to hear.  1) Having East Coast just within walking distance is such a good outlet for destressing after a study/mugging session. Sitting on the breakwater and letting that sea breeze melt your stresses away was awesome.   2) For me, having Changi Airport as part of my route home provided me a place to hang out just before going home. Grabbing a small bite or mocha frappacino and drinking while watching planes can be relaxing.  3) Orientation Week was the most fun I have ever had in any school. 17 years ago was a long time but I still remember my O group and the school dances that we had to learn.   Wow. Thanks for making me go for a trip down memory lane. :)  All the best and I'm sure whichever JC you choose, you'll fit right in!"
singapore,3can84,vanilluff,2,Tue Jul 7 10:47:26 2015 UTC,"Heh, batchmate found.  I think it depends on what you wanna do in school?  My elder cousin's experience in a 'neighbourhood jc' was that the teachers refused to give more than two shits when he proactively wanted to take up more work (more H3, more academic competitions, etc). The heads of department he dealt with just gave all sorts of bullshit excuses and delayed replying to him as much as possible so that he would not have to trouble them to play teacher in-charge to him. He did try to negotiate with the VP, though, and he's doing super well in uni now.  This can be pretty damaging if you want to aim high as the opportunities you see in front of you aren't yours to take."
singapore,3can84,KeythKatz,2,Tue Jul 7 15:57:52 2015 UTC,"Aiya. Don't care what JC you go to. All the same one lah  I would say that distance plays a huge part especially as a JC student. You're going to end school at around 5pm (after CCA: 7pm-8pm) on most days, and if you spend too much of your time travelling, you may be worn out.  There will be tons of open houses after your results come out and that is also a time when you can ask your seniors and friends about the school you want to end up in.  Ultimately how well you do is largely determined by your attitude.   I'm a poly student and am happy doing what I'm doing. And one important thing to note is - if you're not used to high-level stress, and find studying for your 'O' levels a really stressful thing already -  it would be better to consider not entering a JC. Because I have seen people suffer.  But of course I do not know you. You could be a super good student getting superb grades. So following that assumption you may most likely have no problem coping with high-level stress.  NYJC has been lowering its COP. From 9 points to 6 points in just three years. On the other hand if I'm not wrong VJC's COP hasn't really changed.   I don't really see any factors to consider when it's one school versus another as long as you do not let your environment affect you to a very large extent.   If you're one of those kinds of people who stops being motivated because everyone around you stops being motivated as well, then maybe going to a JC with a lower COP is great for you in my opinion. Because people there can push you and give you stress.  I feel that NYJC is a good choice. I mean, it's closer to your place."
singapore,3can84,doombringer50,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:07:11 2015 UTC,"It would be good to check out the open houses next year! I feel that open houses, while obviously not very accurate, gives me a good feel of the school and its ""culture""."
singapore,3can84,KeythKatz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:31:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not from any of the schools mentioned here but I do live pretty damn far away from my JC... Graduated last year so thank goodness there's no more traveling across the country every morning.  It's true that if there's a big distance obstacle to overcome each morning you'll get jaded early on in the day. It may affect your spirits for the rest of the day, which will definitely become something to worry about because I feel that you need stamina to tahan in JC, be it through lectures or tutorials or CCA or homework or whatever. If you get sick and tired of the rather tedious routine, everything else will be that much more lehcheh and tough in comparison.  JC is also about perspective, I guess; if you feel that you entered this JC for a reason that means a lot to you (be it for reputation or culture or whatever) then distance may not be that much of an obstacle for you. I chose my JC over another one which was slightly better academically because I loved how the culture was there (from what I saw at open house). I know I was too quick to judge and it came across as a rash decision but I didn't regret it at all. I went in believing that if I had picked another school, I'd forgo the culture that I could enjoy here, which wasn't a sacrifice I could make.  At the end of the day, it boils down to what you judge a JC based on, and that will become clearer to you by the time your O Levels come and go."

Logic tells me that a shop can't survive by giving free stuff so eventually I'm sure they're selling stuff that doesn't work to gullible folk.   Sigh...
singapore,3c9mvo,RancidBurgers,11,Mon Jul 6 04:29:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly! There is one of these near my grandmother's house and she used to go there very often until it got closed down. I sat in once and the people promoting were spewing bullshit out of their asses. There will limited 'seats' in the shop and so like in the picture, many people will be seen waiting outside. They will give small samples of free things, inline with the 'theme' of the day. (They sold different things everyday) I managed to find out what they sold: like a tiger balm size container of 'horse balm' and it was 80 bloody dollars. And even worse, almost of of these elderly folk are buying this expensive bullshit. Luckily, this shop was only there for about 2 months. It's really unscrupulous of what they are doing like what OP said. Smh"
singapore,3c9mvo,evereddy,6,Mon Jul 6 05:38:54 2015 UTC,"what I have seen from those free sample, free test stuff are the following:  Free sample - somehow they give a pitch to scare you on how badly will do, and then speak of some of the miracle medicine with which to fix those issues ...and try to push sell it.  Free test - they will find something potentially dangerous, but with a caveat that the free version of the test is not accurate enough, and recommend you to get a more accurate but paid test done. They will offer a ""discount"" for the said test, if an appointment is taken immediately for some advance payment.  Both ripoff ... ways to sell people an overpriced (and possibly needless and useless) product by scaring the shit out of them ..."
singapore,3c9mvo,PsauL,4,Mon Jul 6 06:06:23 2015 UTC,I wonder if they are breaking any laws so that we can report such shops to the authorities for cheating the hard-earned savings of the old folk.

singapore,3c9mvo,ballistics64,3,Mon Jul 6 06:53:28 2015 UTC,"Well, you can look at it that way. During a typical session (or at least, the only one session I went to), they'll get the aunties and the uncles who are regulars there to give testimonials on how effective the treatments are. The were those that say they slept better at night, less aches, hair turning from grey to black, etc. From what I heard, the device is very expensive, and only perhaps a few can afford to buy it.   Also, it's mostly retired people there, who can afford to wait around  for one of these (hourly) sessions.   Yes, I entered the place as a skeptical person. I thought I was going to be forced to sit through a sales session. But nah, none of that happened."

singapore,3ca97z,greenteaapple,17,Mon Jul 6 09:20:30 2015 UTC,"""I’ll readily admit that many people around the world use freedom of expression selfishly and irresponsibly. But I would request that we also acknowledge that the same is true of many in power who curtail that freedom. Neither side holds the monopoly on either virtues or vices. But there should be absolutely no doubt about which can do more damage to society. The irresponsible exercise of freedom of expression can be harmful, but the danger pales in comparison to the miseries caused throughout history by powerful men who silence speech."""
singapore,3ca97z,KaseyRyback,5,Mon Jul 6 09:22:11 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth I've bought and enjoyed reading 2 of Cherian George's books. However, as it's waaay easier to just agree with this well written article, I'll try to poke some holes for my own entertainment.   So while Mr George isn't really suggesting for anything that controversial (at least not in my view), it was telling when he used empty phrases like ""shared humanity"" and ""deeply selfless act of citizenship"" as his closer.  If I understand correctly, Mr George is basically just saying freedom of expression is not a selfish nor irresponsible right.  My main disagreement with the wholen thing is Mr George doesn't come up with a fully thought out counterfactual, some 'what if' scenarios. He's just saying free speech, ????, profit.  He neglects to consider the direct costs. As free speech gets closer to his ideal, not only would the 'legal' (he uses the ICCPR as his basis) exceptions be correspondingly diminished but they'd really just fade away because it becomes harder to enforce them without looking political. Yes, incitement to inflict harm on X community is distinguishable from merely hurting the 'feelings' of X community; but imo, really this kinda distinction really breaks down when society gets to, or when the law is at such a stage. To the extent that the distinction is enforced, it may be tainted as political by people whose interests conflict with the enforcement, regardless of whether it is.   In other words, close to the advanced liberal democracies of the West. It just makes the divisions and distinctions within society - that may or may not already exist - come out in the open. You just end up with a lot of of voices here and there, yeah you feel good about the debate. People talk about differing viewpoints etc, but they'd never thought about what happens if in a Parliament of 100 seats you have 100 different parties in it.  Mr George also says defamation actions against political opponents are disproportionate to the aims set out in the ICCPR. While I do personally think it can be overreach there perhaps might be good reasons for PAP politicians to do so [not that PAP are the only people that do it in Singapore or indeed in the world]. If some accusation throw around is indeed false on the facts, PAP might be of the view that it's just generally unhealthy and unproductive for such untruths to be circulating. Not only would they constantly spend resources discussing a non-issue without hope of convincing the other side [because if you invoke the Singapore is exceptional argument, you'd find that some things are kept hidden from us for our own good. for further reading see President Ong]; but you'd have fringe groups latching on to such sensationalism and lapping it up. Then at the end of the day, it's like 1 step forwards for free speech and 2 steps back for the country and its people. Nothing substantial is achieved.   SCOTUS's Justice Scalia once said ""People look at rights as if they were muscles — the more you exercise them, the better they get."" Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for some) there's some truth in that. There's gonna be a lot more people talking and talking. Then one day you'll get all these fringe groups that used to be fucken jokes suddenly being taken seriously and getting interviews and shit because now you know, everyone's view is impt. That of course is no real biggie, but really at the end it's gonna be a lot of people talking over each other than to each other.  Mr George then says he recognises there are "" forums where ensuring the quality of discussion and getting real work done takes precedence over people’s need to speak up"". Unfortunately, as we have seen on the internet, everyone is an expert or at least thinks their view should matter on everything. It's my understanding that in some parts of the US intelligent design is taught as an alternative to evolution.  Mr George also cites ""public funded but politically independent broadcasters"" as a way to ensure voices are heard. It is enough to say these ""politically independent broadcasters"" are often defending themselves against accusations of political bias. [Their whole existence is contrary to the views of some political views]  Mr George then says ""Democratic theory does not deny that certain public institutions, while ultimately in tune with the national climate, must be kept insulated from the vagaries of day-to-day public opinion so that it they can make just and long-term decisions. The challenge, instead, is to strike the right balance between responsiveness and autonomy"".   He also says ""Singapore does not appear to have found the right balance."" Perhaps.  Mr George talks about how power is all set up within the Singapore system with little fail safes other than an elected President so if PAP loses everything can go pear shaped real fast. If PAP does indeed lose and to Singapore gets governed by some 2nd rate people, I'd think free speech would be the least of our problems. And indeed if the electorate were capable of forming their own view as to what is in their best interests, why would Mr George be concerned as to how they exercise their power. If the electorate and the government indeed acted in a way which some might say was contrary to the long term interests of the country, it is a choice they made.  Lastly he talks about how ""[t]he selfless and responsible thing for people to do is to invest in the insurance policy of democratic checks and balances, chief among which is freedom of expression, even if this means slower governance."" Again, if Singapore can function and maintain or continue to have good standards of living under such a model, why the fuck not. However, imo it all comes down to what I posted the other day on about the pace of growth/happiness issue. If happiness is the aim, and if a lower standard of living leads to that aim, yeah why the fuck not. Note my premise is that you can't have your cake and eat it. Without Temasek and GIC Singapore already runs on a deficit. To Mr George, the whole thing is an insurance policy, to me that goes without saying, but it is fundamentally a gamble: a gamble that if lost we can never come back from but if won, we'd be the better for it.    Sorry for what may be an incoherent post but it's kinda difficult to argue against something that I'm not really against in principle."
singapore,3ca97z,hamsalamibacon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:48:04 2015 UTC,"Hey, I thought it was a well-written comment with good points, even if I don't agree with your overall stand.   The fact many people forget is that the majority of SGians don't really give a shit about ideals and stuff. It's their bank account and the immediate economic outlook that is way more important.   Which is why PAP will keep on winning and winning and winning unless the SG economy becomes a huge mess (whether it is PAP's fault or not).  Even then, I'm not convinced by the quality of our opposition. I'm even more unconvinced by the arguments by people who say we need a fresh start. But at what cost? Dismantling the mechanisms PAP already put in place to run the country will be a futile task.  And it doesn't end with the G. Unions are linked to PAP. Religious groups, charities, etc.   Change for the sake of change is dumb, and as long as the opposition maintains that stance, they will remain irrelevant."

singapore,3ca97z,deeazy,5,Mon Jul 6 12:07:13 2015 UTC,"He summarized it nicely for you at the bottom of his article   In summary, freedom of expression is about giving all the right to be heard, not just giving ourselves the right to speak. It is about recognising the shared humanity of total strangers, including people who may have very different values and interests from us. In this respect, committing oneself to freedom of expression as a universal right is a deeply selfless act of citizenship."

singapore,3ca97z,condor_gyros,5,Mon Jul 6 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"What he's trying to say is that freedom of expression doesn't just mean everyone having the right to say whatever they want. It also means having the right to be heard. Certain individuals shouldn't have more of a right to be heard than others, because we are all human beings, and each of us having differing beliefs and value systems doesn't change that.  Being able to say whatever you want doesn't matter if your reach is being suppressed. Therefore, as a citizen of your country, it is your obligation to ensure that freedom of expression is a universal right."

Otherwise, freedom of express is everywhere. Especially in social media. On a daily basis, tons of site are condemning the G and the Lees.   Anyway, I find the AGC statement on Amos Yee very much sums up Singapore's stand on free speech. Here is the excerpt   At the outset, it is critical to reiterate what this case is about. It is most certainly not about the freedom of speech and the diversity of views. It is about the abuse of these freedoms. Unbridled speech without limits does not exist in any known society. Each society defines its own values and protects them. Religious harmony remains a key value in our society. So too is public decency. Under our laws, lines are drawn against acts that deliberately wound religious feelings and against the publication of images that have a tendency to deprave and corrupt. Amos Yee crossed those lines withcdeliberation and calculation. His actions led to his conviction."

singapore,3ca9y3,dashrandom,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:41:44 2015 UTC,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Empire   Sunshine Empire was a Multi Level Marketing (MLM) company, set up in 2006, based in Singapore. It is now defunct, with assets frozen by the Singapore Court. The company is listed by the Singapore Government's Monetary Authority in its Investor's Alert List, for possibly running investment schemes without authority. After investigation by the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) of the Singapore Police and a court trial, Sunshine Empire's Directors were charged with and found guilty of fraud, criminal breach of trust and falsifying accounts.  [...]  It was reported that there was also a group of middle-aged people who were trained separately from the majority and who drove luxury sedans like Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs despite being only in their early twenties. These ""car achievers"" were also known as managers who always dressed smartly in black suits and carried Montblanc pens and wallets. According to a former member of Sunshine Empire, these managers would take other members out for supper after the training sessions because they said it would foster bonding and that it was an opportunity for other members to see the cars they drove.   Lol just also saw a documentary describing how Sunshine Empire came about."
singapore,3ca9y3,dingjer,3,Tue Jul 7 00:37:12 2015 UTC,"I was conned into going for one of these ""meetings"". Ns friend who I didn't talk to for a long time asked me out for a meal. At some curry png place at Orchard. When I reached there there were a SHIT TON of people dressed like they were going for some formal wedding dinner... Eating 2.50 scissor cut curry rice. So he talked to me about ""business opportunities"" blah blah blah. I tried to leave asap but he kept asking me to stay till someone sir (can't remember the name, but they addressed him as name+sir) arrived. So this guy driving a BMW (they park by the road next to the curry png stall so you can see their cars) comes out and suddenly everyone is greeting him like he's the fucking prime minister or something. Dude talks to me and tells me how his pen is worth more than all the clothes on my body. He can probably see me controlling my laughter at this point and asks me what's so funny. I tell him my dad drives the same car as him and my mum drives a merc. He's a little stunned and realises this approach isn't going to work so starts trying to sell me some bullshit about how working for them doing sales will help boost your confidence, how my friend found a girlfriend after he started working there, etc.   I managed to walk away after realising they weren't going to end the conversation. Just got up and left. Not heard from that friend since and don't want to ever hear from him again."

After more than 100 years under UK rule, the Lee's tough stance and never-bow-down attitude irks the local people. When they were handed over to the Chinese, it irritates them even more to the extent that they boo their own national anthem during a HK soccer match.  In the eyes of the Hong Kong people, SG is independent, more successful and they are stuck with rude chinese tourists. Stuck because if they don't have them, their services industry will be screwed.  So, when the other side does not confirm to their ideas of Democracy, adhering to the iron laws of Human Rights, they make a big fuss. Well, if you have nothing to call your own, pride and respect is what you value the most.  Just saying..."
singapore,3c8tez,StopAt2,8,Mon Jul 6 02:33:28 2015 UTC,"Hong Kong cannot survive with independence. There was never talk about Hong Kong becoming independent because everyone knows it won't work.  The boos that rang out during that match was because of the racist comments made by China FA. The anthem is played every day, and you don't see people booing it.  The rude chinese tourist is a fact, but it is because of the bigger knock on effect they had on the market everyone is annoyed about: Shops everywhere all cater to the chinese tourists, driving up rents and getting rid of small businesses. Have a walk down CWB or Mongkok now. There's so little privately owned shops. Everywhere are ""pharmacies"" selling seafood.  Finally, HKers do know what works for SG may not work for HK, and vice versa. Two completely different demographics and locations.   The groups that are protesting are Scholarism (People behind the umbrella revolution, which was great when it started, but started losing support as it dragged on for months without any resolution) and League of Social Democrats (known as the group that throws bananas and disrupting/having fun during legico meetings.) It is a small group of 50 people protesting, not the entire Hong Kong going up in arms like what the media is presenting it to be."
singapore,3c8tez,Snowstormzzz,-7,Mon Jul 6 06:12:52 2015 UTC,"That's the way you'd like to imagine HK people view Singapore, however it is not. Can you also explain how Singapore is more successful than HK?   I would say it's Singapore that has nothing to call its own. A cultureless and intellectually dead nation with no identity that is full of zombies that think any harmless difference in opinion or behaviour should result in harsh punishments. Anyone would prefer HK to Disneyland with the death penalty. At least HK isn't a family-run dictatorship. How long will it take for Singaporeans to realise that something is wrong? When Singapore is still being ruled by the tenth successive member of the Lee dynasty hopefully they'll start to realise something just isn't right."

No idea why you'd not like Disneyland with the death penalty - unless you want to do something that could get you hit with a death penalty, you're really only experience disneyland.  And 10th successor of the Lee dynasty? Really? Lee Hsien Leong is only his son - and he is of his own merit to a decent extent (NOT denying nepotism - but the dude was also top in his level in Cambridge for Math IIRC. He speaks 3 languages as well. I would call him fairly intelligent and his PR skills are pretty good at as well).  Odds are the Lee dynasty isn't going any longer than LHL. I mean there isn't any capable successor to it as far as I see. Someone else will step into the shoes of benevolent dictator.  But ultimately I think a lot of people in SG will agree that having an enjoyable/comfortable life (which, having come from India, I assure you we do) triumphs over some silly ideals of freedom.  Granted - this lasts as long as the dictators are nice and effective. But for all that while, I'm afraid I will take disneyland any day of the week."

It's as safe and has as a high standard of living as Singapore, except it's not dull and you don't feel like you're living in North Korea. You only probably prefer Singapore because you find it easier to integrate into as an Indian rather than ethnically homogenous HK.    No idea why you'd not like Disneyland with the death penalty.    Because I'd rather live in a city with a pulse. I don't live just for working.     And 10th successor of the Lee dynasty? Really?    Why not? He doesn't even feel secure in his own position seeing as he sues journalists for writing that he gained his position for nepotism. His academic accomplishments are meaningless in the context of top level decision makers. I don't believe it's a coincidence that out of all the competent people available the son of the head of state was chosen to succeed him.    But ultimately I think a lot of people in SG will agree that having an enjoyable/comfortable life (which, having come from India, I assure you we do) triumphs over some silly ideals of freedom.   Singaporeans don't have an opinion on anything, which is why it's easy for the state to control them. Freedom isn't a silly ideal, and you can have a high standard of living alongside having freedom (SG is the only developed country with no freedom). Everybody should be concerned that you can't even make YouTube videos without fear of being arrested. The problem is that there is much debate as to why there are virtually no cultural achievements in Singapore, why despite its huge investment in education it hasn't produced one outstanding scientist, engineer or writer, and not even one Nobel Prize. The root of the problem is that you are not allowed to think independently in Singapore because it's practically illegal. Same reason why Singapore has no real culture."
singapore,3c8tez,ashbourne10,3,Mon Jul 6 22:23:45 2015 UTC,"I would say it's Singapore that has nothing to call its own.   Im not sure man. The Singaporean accent is one that we do call our own.

Intellectually dead   NUS beat HKU to the rankings.   harmless difference in opinion   Differing opinions is fine. But it should never cross the line to insult race and religion(which is what Amos did). Unlike Hong Kong, Singapore's demographic is more racially diverse. We don't want to see a repeat of the racial riots.   Anyone would prefer HK to Disneyland with the death penalty.   The death penalty only applies if you're a murderer or a drug smuggler. If you are either, then I hope you choose HK over Singapore too.   At least HK isn't a family-run dictatorship   At least we have a democratic electoral process. Don't like it? We have a chance to vote them out every 5 years. Cant say the same for HK."
singapore,3c8tez,Wheat-gen-stein,-1,Mon Jul 6 14:49:41 2015 UTC,"An accent isn't a culture. Does Singapore even have a language to call its own?  HK has historically been part of China so it's not a poor reflection of HK to have a connection to mainland China. Furthermore, you underestimate how autonomous HK is in itself. It is practically an independent state, not that this matters though or changes the fact that it has a clear and identifiable culture and national identity that is world famous.  University rankings are not everything. Has Singapore ever won a Nobel Prize, Booker Prize or Fields Medal?  Furthermore most of Singapore's academic success is due to its immigration policy favouring gifted Chinese students.  So Amos cannot insult race or religion but Lee Kuan Yew can? What kind of bullshit is that?  HK has an electoral process and ranks higher than Singapore in the democracy index and press freedoms. Simple as that."
singapore,3c8tez,ashbourne10,2,Mon Jul 6 22:36:15 2015 UTC,"An accent isn't a culture. Does Singapore even have a language to call its own?   Singlish. Its not an official language by any measure. But if only Singaporeans can understand then its our own.   University rankings are not everything. Has Singapore ever won a Nobel Prize, Booker Prize or Fields Medal? Furthermore most of Singapore's academic success is due to its immigration policy favouring gifted Chinese students.   Haha. Success of Chinese students? Please, you give them too much credit. Looks like you still have those Chinese roots deep in you seeing how much you praise them. International students only take up 18% of the local university population. Not even half of that are China students. Not to mention that our academic standards were already great even before the liberal immigration policies.   So Amos cannot insult race or religion but Lee Kuan Yew can? What kind of bullshit is that?   I never said that. Im against what LKY said about Malays as well. And I believe he should have been held responsible for them too.   HK has an electoral process and ranks higher than Singapore in the democracy index and press freedoms. Simple as that.

singapore,3c8tez,Syncopat3d,37,Mon Jul 6 00:57:47 2015 UTC,"Having a greater demand for it doesn't equal to better understanding. Most of the people protesting on the streets have only a one-dimensional understanding of the situation - That the expression regulations are more stringent. They raise their voices over the lack of anything, yet, they do not understand what impacts that actually has on the society, what led to that state of affairs, or why that is so. As have been pointed out numerous times, there has never been unfettered freedom of speech in any parts of the world. Expression freedom has always been bound by the unique needs of each society.   People say that freedom of speech is a right. Yes it is, but what makes a right? Rights are normative rules to societies, normative, meaning that it depends on the views of the people belonging to that particular society, it can change, it can take up various forms. Rights are never universal, otherwise, non-American citizens would all have the right to arm themselves seeing that bearing arms is a right in the US."
singapore,3c8tez,Azuredrak,7,Mon Jul 6 01:01:25 2015 UTC,I don't think the issue is about freedom of speech. The level of freedom of speech in Singapore has always been consistent throughout the years. They seem to be protesting over the treatment of AY by the authorities.

singapore,3c8tez,Locnil,15,Mon Jul 6 03:36:21 2015 UTC,"So... What was the point you were trying to drive at?   Human rights are arbitrary because humans are well, humans. Minimum group effect and insider-outsider distinction mean we will never naturally consider others equal. It actually takes deliberate effort to treat others with a 'basic' level of respect and afford them a basic level of rights.  Culture also plays a role. How accepting is a certain culture of certain beliefs / lifestyles / choices? These naturally affect the arbitrariness of human rights.   Tl;dr: human rights aren't universal."
singapore,3c8tez,dashrandom,-6,Mon Jul 6 03:46:24 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But you are being obtuse; in context, I was questioning his choice to dismiss free speech as important based solely on that fact rights were arbitrary. I'm still not sure why you jumped in."
singapore,3c8tez,Locnil,3,Mon Jul 6 05:50:44 2015 UTC,I don't think he's wrong. Free speech is more important in some societies than others...
singapore,3c8tez,dashrandom,-8,Mon Jul 6 06:02:37 2015 UTC,"And yet, he failed to give a cogent defense for why free speech is somehow less of an issue in Singapore than other countries, especially since responsiveness is one of the few advantages a small country has over a larger one. As have you, for that matter."

We all have our one dimensional understanding of the situation and it is foolish to believe that those in power knows better than you, they may have more feedback or indicators than many of us but cannot completely understand what happens on the ground.   The only way to achieve a proper understanding of any situation is by starting to listen to what every parties have to say, even if it may sometime be too simplistic or, as you put it, one dimensional. Unfortunately it is not always easy nor legal to be able to voice your opinion or your concerns too loud and a demonstration is one way to achieve that as in group we are less vulnerable to abuse than an individual. There would be no need for demonstration in a society where information flows freely and the decision making process made transparently."
singapore,3c8tez,zabadap,5,Mon Jul 6 06:22:31 2015 UTC,"There would be no need for demonstration in a society where information flows freely and the decision making process made transparently.   That's a rather naive view of things. Most protests occur because the protestors are unhappy with the decisions made by those in power, whether it's people clamouring for political reform or wage disputes between worker unions and their company. Even if the decision making process were 100% transparent, there will still be protests if people are unhappy with the outcome of said process."
singapore,3c8tez,cowbungaa,-2,Mon Jul 6 07:56:19 2015 UTC,"You bring a good point that I forgot to mention, it is not only about transparency but also wether the decision was made regarding everyone's interest or not. Of course, if the decision was made in a way that left some parties unhappy, they should voice their discontent.   You should always try to put yourself in people's shoes and understand that if they are protesting, they certainly have genuine reasons to join the protest. As mush as I would like, protests are not so easy to set up and usually results from several disapointment that built up over the years.   I would argue that public demonstration is a healthy way to voice an opinion in a society that lacks the tools to bring that opinion up the officials by other mean (free press, associations, access to information, education, etc.) and even then, if you ever had the opportunity to join a public demonstration, it reminds the citizens that they are many and that the people in power are only there with the consent of the people. I think it is an healthy exercice to keeps the balance of power, well, balanced."
singapore,3c8tez,zabadap,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:47:33 2015 UTC,"Of course, if the decision was made in a way that left some parties unhappy, they should voice their discontent.   That's the problem. It's impossible to please everyone - no matter what decision you make, some people are bound to be unhappy. If everyone starts a protest whenever they disagree, society will be in perpetual chaos. Then you'll get extreme situations like Thailand, where Red Shirts and Yellow Shirts were taking turns to protest/riot depending on who was in power, resulting in the military junta we see today.   I would argue that public demonstration is a healthy way to voice an opinion in a society that lacks the tools to bring that opinion up the officials by other mean (free press, associations, access to information, education, etc.)    That's what democratic elections are for. Part of representative democracy means having to accept decisions made by your representatives even if you disagree with them. If you really dislike your representatives so much, then direct your energies to getting them voted out at the next elections. Public demonstrations (eg. the Thai protests) are much more disruptive to the lives of common people than the political elites they are targeting."
singapore,3c8tez,cowbungaa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:41:07 2015 UTC,"I am not a big supporter of representative democracy for the reason that I don't think they know more or are more capable of than anybody else.   Then, of course you will never take decision that please everyone, but the least you can do is listen those you displeased. Yet again, if your society is not organised in a way for the information to flow in an healthy way (which is being able to voice your opinion, access to information, having structures to filter and process the information), you'll be vulnerable to manipulation (from parties, government, rioters, extremists or your every day joe)"

Personally speaking I don't think we have a dissociative disorder, I get the feeling the HK people are protesting for the sake of protesting, plus the chances of them getting persecuted are less.   And lastly, these idiots are calling for stupid measures. The courts have found him guilty of two charges, and you think we will change our courts decision simply because a bunch of idiots overseas are whining? They obviously don't remember Michael Fay."

singapore,3ca406,evilplushie,6,Tue Jul 7 02:05:11 2015 UTC,"It's hardly a new argument.  Whether Singapore is actually meritocratic or not is actually debatable, given issues such as socioeconomic differences at birth, preferences for children of alma maters in prestigious schools, and the definition of merit in heavily academic terms.  If you hold that Singapore isn't actually meritocratic, and combine that with the widespread belief that we are meritocratic, then it simply follows that it's a myth."
singapore,3ca406,oklos,6,Mon Jul 6 13:52:39 2015 UTC,"So what would a ""true"" meritocracy look like, then? I've never had a decent answer, because if you remove parenting and social circumstance from the picture, then it boils down to genetics and that's the most unfair lottery we humans take part in. A ""truly meritocratic""  society sounds almost like an argument for eugenics."
singapore,3ca406,fuzzybunn,2,Mon Jul 6 17:38:53 2015 UTC,"If you take that argument far enough, then yes, what would be 'truly meritocratic' would be to alter everyone's genes to be exactly the same. Everyone would be the same sex, look the same, and have the exact same dispositions. The exact same education and the exact same opportunities and even eat the same food. So nobody has an added advantage in any way possible. Then everyone would be equal and we would all be robots. But we would be equal robots."
singapore,3ca406,Wheat-gen-stein,2,Tue Jul 7 04:34:38 2015 UTC,"In some ways, you are right that a 'true meritocracy' would in effect just be another genetic lottery due to accident of birth; in that specific sense, it wouldn't be that different from a traditional aristocracy. There are, however, at least two main replies to this. The first is that meritocracy at least rewards ability and is thus beneficial for society as a whole, rather than the relatively irrelevant criterion of whether one happens to be born into a particular family line. Furthermore, rewarding merit may not be merely reducible to the 'genetic lottery', since ability is arguably not only due to the natural talent one is born with, but also dependent on the work one puts into improving oneself.  Meritocracy is primarily defined in opposition to more traditional societal models that favour family connections, etc. Purportedly, meritocracy instead rewards those with ability, who would deserve to rise to higher positions in society. As with most (if not all) ideals, you won't get any 'true' or 'perfect' examples of meritocracy; nevertheless, given the above, we can at least spell out some likely features:   equality of opportunity  ability to detect merit social mobility   Mass education (and to some extent, healthcare) is often critical in allowing the masses to overcome established privilege and achieve comparable equality of opportunity, and Singapore is one of the countries that have achieved this fairly effectively. In line with that, we also have a stringent selection process for identifying top students through various public and private institutions, and in many cases those selected for these top posts have come from humble backgrounds, providing strong examples of social mobility.  Where this breaks down is arguably in three main areas: a subversion of meritocracy over generations, a failure to properly identify merit, and too much faith in the meritocratic system working despite these problems.  The reliance on tuition (and the financial costs associated with that for families) is the most obvious factor that suggests that equality of opportunity may have been eroded over the generations. Better socioeconomic status is also tied to better home support for students, ranging from simple things like a more comfortable home environment to favoured admission into preferred schools through parents' alumni status. Social mobility, in this sense, becomes less common as those who succeed in the first round act to give their own children advantages that, while not insurmountable, do make it harder for those less privileged to succeed.  Our overwhelming focus on tying notions of merit to academic success further exacerbates this at each level. The focus on streaming means that those initially disadvantaged will find it that much harder to get back on equal terms in schools, while the fast-tracking of scholars in the civil service and military means that we may well be narrowly placing too much emphasis on prior academic performance as a primary measure of merit, when arguably on-the-job performance should count for more.  Meanwhile, despite these flaws, there is a generally strong belief that we are indeed meritocratic, to the extent that some see it as almost perfect in that respect. Not surprisingly, this will especially be so for those who have succeeded within this system; even with advantages, a lot of work is usually required for one to succeed in our competitive environment, and this feeds into the idea that success is the result of one's own talent and hard work, often ignoring any privileges that one may have. Beyond the dismissal of those who do not succeed as lazy or stupid (a social problem in itself), it also gets in the way of establishing a 'better' meritocracy because those who are successful under the existing system would resist the idea that it may not actually be working that well, and this would mean a reluctance to entertain changes to the system that might make it more meritocratic. It would, for example, probably make the system more meritocratic if favoured admission to 'elite' schools for the children of alumni was eliminated, but it's almost certain that this would not go down well with many of those concerned.  tl;dr: 'true' meritocracy is probably impossible, but we need to keep looking to improve the fairness and accuracy of the system in identifying merit and rewarding it, and not assume that it will work because it has in the past."
singapore,3ca406,oklos,0,Tue Jul 7 08:43:45 2015 UTC,"TOC is a community with different authors. Not all of them share the same opinion.  The second post doesn't attack meritocracy.   It says that ""natural aristocracy"" being established doesn't mean that they deserve respect. Respect needs to be earned.   Would you call all our current ministers a ""natural aristocracy""? If you do (and I don't), I still don't believe Chan Chun Sing or Lawrence Wong are worthy of my respect until they earned it. Also CCS was floated in, I'm not convinced it was ""natural""."

Even if it doesn't explicitly say so, they will work from 100-250v AC, 50/60Hz.   The TV standard these days is all signals over HDMI - you would get a set top box from your cable provider (Comcast, Verizon etc) and plug that in to your TV. Everything will work on 720p and 1080i/1080p.  However, digital tuner standards in the US may differ from what your TV is capable of. If connected to an antenna your TV may or may not be able to tune the channels. This is easily overcome if you buy a TV tuner from Amazon, which should run you $30 or so - antenna in, HDMI out.  If you are getting relocation, by all means take your TVs to the States. They may be cheap but why start off with unnecessary expenditure if you can avoid it. Just get them packed with the beds, dinner set and children's toys (all of which are cheaper here as well, but doesn't make sense to buy all over again).  If you have an Xbox, that may be a different story - they are region locked. Singapore Xboxes are NTSC-J and USA Xboxes are NTSC-U. If you buy a disc from Gamestop, it won't work."

singapore,3cbpsw,Heroicdeath,3,Mon Jul 6 17:55:41 2015 UTC,"Hi there!  Thanks for the article. I was deciding between taking the current SAT or the newer one, and decided on the current one because I thought the format of the newer test would be more obscure, and there would already have been tons of material prepared for the current SAT. However, after reading that article, I might reconsider again.  I can choose to take the SAT reasoning test or the ACT plus writing, along with 2 additional SAT 2 subject tests. Do you think that the ACT might be a ""better"" test?"
singapore,3cbpsw,onique,3,Mon Jul 6 18:07:55 2015 UTC,I took the SAT (also know as the saturday afternoon test) a long time ago. The scoring mechanism has completely changed since then. I think at the time the max score was 1600 and you would need like a 1540 to get into MIT. Think the new total score is something like 2400. Back in the day there was no test prep services. I might suggest Kaplin or something.
singapore,3cbpsw,hansbolo,2,Mon Jul 6 18:25:10 2015 UTC,"Chinese American, lived in Singapore for 1.5 years recently, (one of the reasons I still come back and check this sub-reddit occasionally) took the SATs about 15 years ago when I was applying to colleges...  1: 1550: 800 math, 750 verbal, they didn't have that third section (Writing I think?  Or is it reading comprehension?) when I took it.  2: Take practice tests, take as many as it takes until you feel comfortable with the test process and your score.  I don't know the value of paying money for test prep courses, I never did but did attend some offered by my high school that were free.  I don't really feel like prep courses that cost money offer any value, but a) I can only speak for myself and b) my experience was a long time ago.  Just find practice test or past test (and you probably have to pay money for them, but less than for a course) and take them until you get comfortable.  3) I think the main thing will be your knowledge of the subject themselves.  So like, if you know the math, and have the vocabulary/reading skills, all you're really doing is getting used to the test, and hopefully that won't take too much time/practice.  If you are learning the subject as you are practicing for the tests, that's probably not ideal and it might take longer.  4) No clue what JC1 or the extra info you mentioned means, (sorry) so can't say.  What I do know is that the math portion of the regular SAT (not the SAT II math specific tests) was quite simple.  When I took them I think it only went up to trigonometry, so no calculus or anything.  The SAT II subject tests are different and get into slightly (but only slightly) more advanced topics, if I remember correctly.  5) Not sure how it works for overseas students, but when I took them you can take the tests as often as you want (and can pay for, limited by the scheduling in your area) and they will take the highest score for each individual subject out of all of your tests and send that as your score to the college.  The college you apply to will have no other information regarding how many times you took the test.  So for example, if in your first test you got a perfect score on the math but not the verbal, and vice versa on your second test, the score that gets sent to the college is a 1600 (in the old days, when those were the only two subjects) and they can't tell how many tests it took for you to get that 1600, or what your score was on the two separate occasions.  I ended up taking it only once, because I'm a slacker and didn't care about not quite getting that perfect score, or so my parents tell me. :-)"
singapore,3cbpsw,shxwn,2,Mon Jul 6 19:26:40 2015 UTC,"You will do well if you start preparing now for a Jan 2016 test.   Head to your JC's library and borrow the SAT book. I think it's blue and green in color, has the word SAT printed huge across the front, and is thick as f. Then also find a place to buy the SAT wordlist (preferably with definitions). In my JC, i bought it from the photocopying shop.   JC 1 students should be able to do the SAT tests with little problem. The math section is honestly very easy (just dont make careless mistakes). The vocab section might be hard if you aren't thaaat good with your words. The essay section is another part where I think there's a so-called SAT format of writing. Try reading up on the internet or the SAT book about the essay section."

I was never a scholar, and in fact booked the SAT a year in advance and completely forgot about it. Seriously until my calendar reminder went off 1 day in advanced and I crammed the night before.  SAT I is a test really catered to a very wide audience and you'd be surprised how basic it is.  Math section was shit easy for a Singaporean and looking at your bckground it should be a cake walk. English is also decent with 2 parts. I've forgotten the first part, I think it's MCQ/Fill in blanks. The second is a essay which is where most people have trouble... but if your critical writing is good you'll be okay. I was a Poly student (albeit I think I tended to be very good in English) and I found it really easy."
singapore,3cbpsw,spammechuck,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:36:39 2015 UTC,"2330/2400 Divide your preparation into 2 phases: theory and practical. Get a solid grasp of the theory, esp. for the grammar in the writing section. Create (and memorise) canned essay introductions and topics for the essay. Review topics covered in the Maths section. Study techniques for CR and use what works for you. I did 15 days of full-time (8 hour) preparation with a daily practice test. You have plenty of time, but manage it well. I go to an international school cracksat.net has less than legal SAT tests. Use Erica Meltzer's guides for writing and reading. They are superb. Memorise 25 words a day from a flashcard set online.    Take the ACT if you're a 'good' student; take the SAT if you're a good test-taker."

Considering the amount of stress homosexuals face due to their acceptance(or lack thereof) in society and in their family, it wouldn't be wrong to say that some of them do face great personal and social problems. A few of my gay friends were on anti-depressants while in NS. Most of them lack a social support system they can rely on when it comes to problems related to their sexuality or their relationships. This can easily lead to depression. Not everyone is as lucky as you to have been born in an accepting family and community.  Edit: And that is why the MO wants to know.

singapore,3c7t5s,evereddy,11,Mon Jul 6 06:10:50 2015 UTC,"I was equally bewildered when I saw this in my pre-enlistment medical questionnaire. But I chose to see it this way:  Decades have passed since the time when homosexuality was removed from the list of mental illnesses. It would be stupid if the medical authorities in CMPB still see homosexuality as one.  That said, I choose to see that there has been an unfortunately poor choice of wording and phrasing involved in that contentious question. While, homosexuality wouldn't be considered a ""medical"" problem anymore (this is where their error lies), it could well be a social or, of course, a personal problem for some people especially in a country like ours where homosexuality is still seen as abnormal by, ahem, some people in our communities.  One cannot deny the atmosphere in this country does contribute to some gay men struggling with living double lives, coping with their emotions, and being discriminated against for their sexual preferences. It's no wonder why ""homosexuality"" could well contribute to, or even be, a social or personal problem.  And that's why the question is being asked like ""do you have ~~ problems that you wish to tell the medical officer in private?"" not ""do you have ~~ problems?"" or worse ""are you homosexual?"" I feel like the inference we can make here is that you have the choice to declare or not declare. If you feel your being gay will not be of any obstruction in your service to the country, why should you have to tell? Conversely, if you feel that your sexuality will pose as a problem (perhaps because you feel uncomfortable in an all-male environment, which is fine), then jolly well tell the MO so he/she can make the necessary arrangements.  All in all, I feel like the system in place here looks like a don't-ask-don't-tell policy like what the States used to have. But I may be wrong. Here's why:  I personally have a friend who was stripped of his officer rank right after OCS as someone sent an anonymous tip-off to the authorities about my friend's social media etc. Apparently this was because the directive states that officers cannot be on declared 302 status, and that my friend did not have the integrity to declare so from the beginning - which is ridiculous. Nowhere in that questionnaire states that gay pre-enlistees must declare, and even if it were so stated, that's not reasonable at all.   TL;DR: I feel that the question is erroneously phrased to the effect it considers homosexuality a medical problem, but homosexuality could well be a social or personal problem for some. Phrasing of the question seems to tell that one doesn't have to declare if it's not a problem in his life, yet anecdotes I've heard seem to mandate a declaration of being gay to avoid potential trouble.

However, poorly phrased text is still poorly phrased."

singapore,3c7t5s,drewiepoodle,3,Sun Jul 5 23:43:39 2015 UTC,"Don't lose hope - such issues have a habit of gaining a surge of abrupt support in short periods of time. In Singapore, for example, I believe a large portion of the conservative/anti-gay segment are such purely out of cultural inertia, instead of any true vitriol towards homosexual people. Changing their worldviews in that regard can in fact be quite easy."
singapore,3c7t5s,Locnil,2,Mon Jul 6 08:35:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a problem in the traditional sense. But in terms of how society perceives it and perhaps the lack of social acceptance might lead to the individual having issues coping with their sexual identity.    Most of my friends have trouble opening up to their parents regarding their sexual orientation, it does place a fair amount of stress on them."

Do I think it is a disgrace that nobody can be bothered to phrase the form in a respectful way, in accordance with basic human dignity? Of course.   But do I believe that this reflects the attitude of most Singaporeans, or of most Singaporeans in the SAF? Nope. Hence I think stuff like this will melt away gradually. We are now a forward-thinking society trapped in backward-facing infrastructure. Religious nuts like Lawrence Khong will always exist.

I've think yes. It is a problem for individuals in the army, it would be better to declare it early and avoid any potential problems. The way it was phrased may not have been kind (let's face it, the way army handles some issues harkens back to the stone age), but it isn't entirely wrong.   You can't expect everyone to adopt your worldview because you possess it. That's exactly what religious homophobes are demanding. Don't be like them, be better than them."

There is a shit load of evidence that there are huge issues for homosexual staff in the US army, just do a Google search.  I'm all for equal rights but refusing to accept the reality that discrimination happens and that steps need to be taken to protect homosexuals serving in a conscription based army is stupid imo.

singapore,3c7t5s,drewiepoodle,2,Mon Jul 6 06:14:42 2015 UTC,"So you would rather these individuals be bullied and discriminated to the point of contemplating suicide while you champion your beliefs regarding the disclosure of their sexuality? Sure, people are always the problem. Religion isn't evil, people are. Guns don't kill people, people do. But keep in mind there are actual individuals out there, right now, suffering because of these people. It's easy to take a stand and say your beliefs are right and no one should be afraid when you aren't suffering the backlash like an armchair critic. Yes, your beliefs are right, I believe that homosexuals should not have anything to fear about the disclosure of their sexuality but the reality is that they have a lot to fear, especially in the military.   You're hundred percent right. Bigotry is the problem. Unfortunately, in this case, being able to sit in the comfort of your home and champion your views while others are out there suffering just because they share the same views as you but are in a different environment make you the bigot.  If you are truly for homosexuality and human rights, don't you think in the certain homosexual-unfriendly contexts they need some level of protection? Or do you truly believe they should continue suffering while you champion that those institutions or organizations take years to change and become more accepting? It's easy to talk about your causes and rights when you aren't the one suffering as a result of it. Fuck off."

YOU  do not get a say.   end of story. there's no big discussion to be had. sexuality has nothing to do with how well you do your job. the only problem arises when OTHER people go out of their way to make it a problem.  get over it, people are gay. people have been gay since the dawn of time. people will continue to be gay, wanna know why? because they're born that way.  seriously, join the 21st century already, we're moving on, so come along or get out the way. no one is stopping for you."

There are many gay men I've seen in the force who do not behave effeminately at all, and can function fully as a useful member of the military just like any other guy.  But yes, indeed, gay men who have effeminate behavior may find it difficult to go through NS undeclared. In fact I've heard that one of the criteria that the assigned vocation of any individual who declares is based on is how effeminate he is."

singapore,3c8hmd,Asyrol,9,Mon Jul 6 08:56:33 2015 UTC,"Good Morning Singapore! Last night was our going away party (hence the absence of my winning personality yesterday). We've got more family visiting as well so it's nice to visit and be a little distracted from our pending move. We're down to 10 days!!! Today's question: what bank do you use? Do you like it? Why? Some countries don't do separate credit cards (for example here in Canada you have a debit card tied to your account, and a separate credit card issued by your bank with its own limit. In parts of Europe you just have one card and you choose debit or credit and the credit balance is basically like your overdraft)... What I'd getting credit like in SG?"
singapore,3c8hmd,fanofippo,6,Mon Jul 6 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"Good morning back to you. Hope the party was a blast.   regarding credit - there are tons of banks in Singapore. The big local ones are DBS/ POSB, UOB, OCBC. Each of them have their own credit/ debit cards with their own rewards schemes. There's also overseas banks like Citibank, HSBC etc.   Our bank services are of a high standard, opening a account/ getting credit cards should be a breeze. Here's a good link I found  Personally I would avoid DBS/ POSB.. They are the largest bank in Singapore with the most branches/ ATMs, but also have the largest number of users so I find there's usually a queue for their services heh.   Just ask if you have any questions."
singapore,3c8hmd,mwolfee,3,Mon Jul 6 00:48:00 2015 UTC,"UOB have a decent network of ATMs, and can use OCBC ATMs as well,  though I think you have to pay after certain no. of transactions"
singapore,3c8hmd,random_avocado,2,Mon Jul 6 03:25:43 2015 UTC,"Hmm I think they remove the fees for using UOB atm with OCBC card, vice-versa. Only NETS services will be charged on the third transaction onwards each month"

singapore,3c8hmd,straydog1980,2,Mon Jul 6 01:17:54 2015 UTC,There may not be as extensive an ATM network for the overseas and smaller banks too.
singapore,3c8hmd,MehMehEatGrass,3,Mon Jul 6 03:18:53 2015 UTC,"To answer the other questions, yes, we do have the Debit/Credit card split, with annual income as a requirement to qualify for the various cards out there. The fun part is due to the competition, banks really want you to use their cards, so annual fee wavier is quite easy to obtain. Cancellation is somewhat hasslefree as well, with none of those hidden fee things that American banks are notorious for (personal experience, of course)."

singapore,3c8hmd,czhihong,3,Mon Jul 6 04:05:20 2015 UTC,All preserved; there was a bit of information overload for The Deep but it was atmospheric and pretty cool. Made for a good combi with the colourful Dreamworks.

singapore,3c8hmd,czhihong,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:13:53 2015 UTC,"Off the top of my head, the more heavily featured ones were Shrek (and Puss), Kungfu Panda, HTTYD, Madagascar (and penguins), Prince of Egypt, The Croods. Some others featured were Antz, Bee Movie, Rise of the Guardians, Over the Hedge, Flushed Away, Wallace and Gromit claymation, Mr Peabody and Sherman.  It's not a ton of content, but if you go slowly listening to all the audio, looking at the exhibits and reading the texts it'll probably take the better part of 1.5 hours.

But I went to the museum with low expectations (due to some slightly underwhelming exhibits previously; to be fair I think they were cheaper though) so was pleasantly surprised. $20 was a fair price for both exhibitions I thought and should be the way to go if you're going even to 1, since 1 is $15."

singapore,3c8hmd,nassux,6,Sun Jul 5 23:45:09 2015 UTC,Uni is basically the whole of JC condensed in 13 weeks. And then rinse and repeat for every semester. So uni is much harder by far.
singapore,3c8hmd,mimolo,6,Mon Jul 6 00:28:02 2015 UTC,"I found JC much harder for me to cope because of A levels, in uni I could spread my marks across different assessments i.e. projects, indiv assessments and exams which I much much prefer."
singapore,3c8hmd,MrBottle,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:06:34 2015 UTC,I'm the exact opposite of you. I perform better in JC because I just put all my effort towards one final assessment. It's sort of all or nothing gamble. But I'm not good in multi tasking. So having to focus on one thing only at a time helped me to succeed.   I guess it's up to the individual.
singapore,3c8hmd,crisisd,3,Mon Jul 6 11:46:14 2015 UTC,"Uni was way easier than JC for me.  I was in Business, in one of the local 3 unis though, so YMMV.  I would think those in Sciences or Engineering would think different though."

singapore,3c8hmd,Falwing,2,Mon Jul 6 09:50:00 2015 UTC,Highly suggest that you invest in braided charging cables. You can find some for cheap at Sim Lim and the like but the quantity could be suspect. Better to look online for those that go around $15 that are more sturdy.

singapore,3c8hmd,Falwing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:29:27 2015 UTC,Basically it's woven into a sleeve consisting of 3 nylon cables making it thicker and stiffer. It's usually molded into the ends of the cable which use metal instead of plastic to encase the cable cutting down on the damage pulling and stress on those areas.

singapore,3c9e3n,dashrandom,2,Mon Jul 6 09:12:49 2015 UTC,"IT Fairs dont really sell IT parts, but more of IT products (pre build systems, laptops, monitors, etc)  The prices between IT fair and normal prices is not that different. Sometimes there will be a thread were people compare market prices and IT fair prices. The only real thing you get is a lot more freebies, like thumbdrives, power banks etc  The big difference / savings happens when   1) limited time deals, eg I got a xx system, selling it for reduced price to the first 5 customers! First come first serve!  2) Last day, they want to clear stock, may be open to bargaining. Also, a lot more limited time deals happen then.   In any case IT fairs are not really meant for PC builders. They are meant for aunties and uncles who want to buy stuff. They sell completed systems, and peripherals. Not components. If you're building a PC and getting all the components, the Sim Lim square is your go to place.  Also, PC parts in Singapore are not cheap. Infact buying online can be considerably cheaper, specially for video cards. So you might want to research online first."

Also, shipping is free above US$125, but of course it has to be directly from Amazon and eligible. For heavier stuff such as PSUs and cases, you are better of buying from Singapore since the overseas shipping is a deal breaker.

singapore,3c7y0t,myrares,2,Sun Jul 5 23:18:00 2015 UTC,"There is one important step that many people missed - which means no proof of the validity of his claims are relevant to the fact of this trial.   Roy makes statement about CPF, implying PM has abused CPF PM demands apology, not satisfied with a half-hearted apology and sues Gets handed a summary judgement pronouncing Roy guilty (this is a step that most people seem to gloss over) - the reason is because Roy had given an apology and that was taken as guilt As a result, this current trial is just for determining damages and not the validity of Roy's claims. As such the only relevant information is how much reputation damage PM suffers.   So lesson learnt is never hand an apology or you will get a summary judgment, and not have your day in court to argue the validity of your claims.  For some reason Roy dismisses his lawyers (I have no idea why). This leads to an ineffectiveness in his line of questioning - how can a non-lawyer understand how to argue before a court of law such a complex topic as assessing damage due to defamation?  I think he will get a judgement of around 350K damages, and will be declared bankrupt (unless foreigners can donate) and not be allowed to travel out. PM will donate all proceeds to charity."
singapore,3c7y0t,very_bad_advice,2,Mon Jul 6 08:29:21 2015 UTC,"Roy compared PM Lee handling CPF funds to City Harvest financial management.  Since City Harvest people have been charged with the crime of misappropriation of funds, PM Lee took it to mean that Roy was accusing PM of the same crime.  Roy apologised and offered 5k compensation, but PM took the apology as an admission of guilt and rejected the compensation offer as ""derisory"".  After that it went to court, but since Roy already said sorry for defaming you, PM Lee got a summary judgement ruling that Roy defamed him.  So there was no case and no trial to determine guilt.    In the last week or so, there was a court hearing to determine damages that Roy would have to pay PM Lee for defaming him.  Roy cross examined Lee and then Roy was cross examined by Lee's lawyer, former PAP MP Davinder Singh.  Now we just wait wait for the court to rule how much Roy has to pay Lee.

singapore,3c9qus,mydevilsride,2,Mon Jul 6 05:10:26 2015 UTC,"Hey there OP I just passed this year - learnt Auto. (yes my license is stamped with that SG 50 logo.. Geez)   Here are some tips :   Book BTT first. Having passed BTT is a prerequisite for practical driving lessons. Buy the BTT guidebooks (they are similar in nature so I don't have particular reccomendation), do the test questions inside. Also, you can download this app called BTT SG. It has test questions inside for you to try and practice on the go!!! Super useful.    Btw I didn't sign up for theory lessons in the driving schools. I self learned within a month before taking the test as a ""private candidate""   Now you passed BTT ... Congrats! Now you can sign up for practical lessons as well as take the FTT.    FTT - similar as BTT. Read and study guide book as well as download apps (FTT SG)   Practical lessons - I took at SSDC / woodlands. It's the newest out of all the driving centers. Traffic-wise, afternoon ain't crowded so pick your test during that period. I heard BBDC isn't bad as well. Ubi traffic is rly the worse. A lot of heavy vehicles at every hour and lowest passing rate.   Some people feel private may be better / can ""finish lessons faster"" and cheaper. Personally I prefer the structure of learning from a school, coz there's a set lesson plan. Plus, school students get to practice the circuit without paying extra. Private students need to pay extra fee to enter schools for circuit practice, hence some private instructors don't rly let their students practice and end up failing in circuit!"
singapore,3c9qus,mminsy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:29:32 2015 UTC,Study for your BT test. Most people assume it's easy (it is) but don't study and then fail. Shame ensues. If you're a hands on type and have good psycho-motor skills then private should be fine. If not schools provide a good structure to learn but the speed of your progress likewise is limited.

singapore,3c9qus,bamboostuck,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:54:19 2015 UTC,"(Accidentally submitted my response before completing it)   Where are you learning to drive? One of the driving schools or with a private instructor?  Anyway you have to pass your Basic Theory Test (BTT) first before you get a Provisional Driving License (PDL) which is needed for you to take driving lessons.   At the same time, you will have to sit for the Final Theory Test (FTT) and pass it before you can register for your driving test.  There's nothing much to the theory part. You can register for mock test sessions with the driving schools and practice that way. I remember that the schools issue theory books when you register and you just have to learn and memorise the road signals. BTT is quite easy to pass, mostly common sense questions. FTT is harder, with questions like what certain hand signals mean, what kind of road markings correspond to what, etc.  Give yourself about six months to complete your driving course.  Source: Got my driving licence seven years ago."

singapore,3c9qus,wornmedown,2,Mon Jul 6 05:30:58 2015 UTC,"I'd say the schools are better as opposed to private instructors because the learning is more structured. And you also get priority in booking practice sessions in the circuit. But it is slightly more expensive.  In terms of the driving schools, I think they're the same? I was with SSDC when it was in Yio Chu Kang and had a pretty good experience. Cleared my driving lessons in three months and test in five. Just go to one that's nearest for you cause it's a pain to travel and you'll be going once or twice a week for a couple of months.  Go to the school, sign yourself up and they'll offer lessons on the theory as part of the package. Book your BTT, pass it and you'll start your practical lessons. Book your FTT and pass it. Book your TP (the actual driving test) and you get your driving licence!"

For CDC, if you stay in the northeast area, you can opt for the Oneteam program where you get to learn how to drive around the area. Saves you time from travelling to Ubi area.   That being said, I don't recommend CDC. The Oneteam program is supposed to also be helpful because you don't get to change instructors too often, but it's a lie - they told me maximum 5 different instructors for each student, and I have 7 already - and I have 7 lessons so far. They have A LOT of people wanting to learn, and booking lessons is a pain. Plus I haven't even gone to the circuit yet, and driving on the roads is pretty scary (I have driven in the Ubi area, it's not easy).

Then rinse and repeat everytime I get a craving. Eventually minutes turn into hours, into days."
singapore,3c7hko,jswk,6,Sun Jul 5 19:41:36 2015 UTC,It's just a matter of perspective. The first step is to realise that lighting a stick is more of a want rather than a need to. Overtime things will get easier and you'll stop the habit of lighting up eventually. I've been smoke free for close to a year now and I don't feel the temptation anymore.
singapore,3c7hko,ragingbileducts,5,Sun Jul 5 18:05:38 2015 UTC,"I smoked for over a decade and was an insanely heavy smoker. I stopped on 1st January this year and I have only smoke 2 sticks since then.  I have tried many times and this is the longest I have quit. To me, the most important factors for success were fixing a schedule, finding important reasons to quit, and looking back on the sacrifices.   To elaborate, I always told myself I would quit this year so I did prepare myself for a bit. I placed a lot of emphasis on reasons to quit, mostly due to my occupation since smoking caused me to have sore throats very often. In the process of quitting, I put on a crapload of weight (it's normal). Everytime I feel like relapsing, i just think back on the weight I gained and that usually works for me.  From experience, the key to quitting is a positive attitude towards cessation. If you feel like you're making a huge sacrifice, you'll have a high chance of failing. You must have the desire to quit.  Good luck all."
singapore,3c7hko,TRex_Eggs,5,Sun Jul 5 17:55:04 2015 UTC,I started midway somewhere during poly. But I stopped during NS.

Non-filtered, cloves, etc.  To me, it's all about the decision to quit and when to do it. Quit when you are least stressed with life. I decided to quit before being a father as I knew that the stress of raising a child will make it impossible to quit.  Find a hobby like running.  BTW. You'll put on weight in the initial phase as the mouth needs to keep moving doing something.  And any perceived savings is just relative. It goes elsewhere like a good pair of running shoes."
singapore,3c7hko,Mrvstr,5,Mon Jul 6 00:54:36 2015 UTC,"I know how to smoke around 14, addicted at 16~17 became full blown smoker at 18 (always carry cigarettes and lighter everywhere everyday.) Because of work related stress, I smoked heavily (sometime chain-smoke) for about 12 years until I arrived Singapore.   A lot of people said they have more stress in Singapore. I am having the opposite experience. I don't have to drive, I cannot afford it and I don't need it. For the first time in my life, I work 5 days, 9 to 6 job. These two are the huge factors, I can reduce smoking without effecting my happiness level. Still I smoked two packs a week and never thought about stopping it.  Several months after marriage, me and my wife were discussing about having a child. First thing hit me was my Dad, he smoked but he quit it before I was born. And I don't have to grow up as a second hand smoker. This thought led me to stop smoking. I don't want my son grew up with stinking Dad and my wife, she deserves better. (my wife was never asked me to quit it.)  I talked to my doctor friend who was working in NUH, gave me very good reading materials, offered help (in case I need special consultant but I don't). They explained me about habit and body depending on nicotine.  I took nicotine patch and totally stopped smoking for six months, I kicked the habit first. Then move on to pills (less stronger but still equal to 2 cigs a day) 2 months later I stopped pills and took one cigarette a day or every other day. At this point smoking became a burden and I am very comfortable to stop it. It took me about 10 months total and I became nicotine independent. It has been five years and I don't have to smoke anymore.  P.S : I don't like the word ""Quitting"". I like the word ""Nicotine independent"", I don't want to depend on nicotine and I made it. You can do it too."

Whenever I feel like smoking, I will snack or drink coffee to curb the habit of smoking away. Most importantly I think you need to learn to say ""No"" when people ask you to go for smoke break.

My flat looks way bigger than when I first got the keys before renovation despite the addition of cabinets and furniture.   Also you're bloody exaggerating here.

singapore,3c72p4,mrkiasume,6,Sun Jul 5 18:36:46 2015 UTC,Generallly it's expensive as hell.  But if you lower your living standards/expectations. You should be able to get by with 1/2 a soccer team.  But don't expect being able to give the best milk and pampers and education to them.. unless you're loaded.
singapore,3c72p4,fanofippo,3,Sun Jul 5 23:53:36 2015 UTC,"Father of 2 kids here.  Generally, yes there are some subsidies (like childcare, injections) and cash grants given by the government when your child is born.   But Singapore's cost of living is high, so it's a matter of expectations.. You can't be bringing them out to eat at fancy restaurants everyday!   Personally I think it's a matter of priorities when you have kids.. We dun go for expensive overseas trips, instead there's plenty of cheap/ free experiences for them in Singapore too.    Just ask if you have any questions."
singapore,3c72p4,loonylovegood,0,Mon Jul 6 00:38:35 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: This may sound marginally racist. <End>  In Singapore certain minority races get subsidies for some parts of everyday living, such as free education etc. Also now with the government's efforts to booster the failing birth-rate with pay-outs, there are some portions of Singaporean society that have chosen to have great big honking families. But sad to say even counting that in, it's still not at all affordable or practical to attempt properly raising that many leg-muggers in the Red dot city."
singapore,3c72p4,tehokosong,7,Mon Jul 6 00:18:12 2015 UTC,"I wish to point out that the free education for certain minorities (read: Malay) is not true. Many people mistake it as government-funded, but the free education program is funded by Mendaki, which only receives contributions from the Malay community. It's also for low-income groups.   Just clearing up some misconceptions."

The matching cap to MENDAKI is up to $2million, AMP $1million and the other MMOs $1million"

singapore,3c72p4,Wheat-gen-stein,2,Mon Jul 6 02:11:12 2015 UTC,"In the first place, education in Singapore isn't even expensive. Primary school education is free for all Singaporeans and Secondary school education only costs $5 a month."
singapore,3c72p4,palysg,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:53:46 2015 UTC,"As a Malay myself. I am at the receiving end of the TTFS subsidies. But its based on income so not ALL malays get it. Only the lower-income groups get it. And it pays for local university tuition fees.   Its positive discrimination in my opinion. The percentage of Malays in local university is smaller than the national percentage of Malays. So its an incentive to boost Malays representation in higher education. Which I think is much better than the Affirmative Action that is practiced in USA. Instead of lowering educational standards, they incentivise with free university education."
singapore,3c72p4,KeythKatz,4,Mon Jul 6 11:39:59 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason is that HDB's new architectural design tries to mimic the ""condo-style"". The chief culprit is the existence of a corridor inside your house that is used to connect your living/dining area to the bedroom/toilets. Some of the newer HDBs now also have balconies.  The corridor and balcony effect makes the unit feel more like a condo unit, but at the expense of floor space. Precious square metres have to be taken from your bedroom and living area to make the corridor and balcony.  If you visit the older HDB flats, you will seldom see balconies and corridors in the unit. All the bedrooms tend to connect directly to the living area. It helps explain why the older units look bigger."
singapore,3c72p4,ARE_U_FUCKING_SORRY,3,Mon Jul 6 03:03:38 2015 UTC,"It's to fit more people in a smaller space. There probably wasn't a ""let's multiply to 7 million"" plan when the HDBs were built, and there were likely other factors that led to the increased floor size. The fact that ""executive"", ""jumbo"", and 2-storey flats exist is pretty telling that the government did a U-turn recently on having large flats.  That said, I love living in a (now discontinued) jumbo and would not trade it for any condo."

On another occasion, he shared an extremely misguided article with the point ""You say we are forcing our views on LGBT people, what about this?""

I would feel happy for any of my friends if they find refuge/solace/peace/purpose in any religion, and I do feel happy for some of my friends who have done so. But it just puts me off how some just lose all logic and sense while being in the thick of things.  Recently had a friend who told me he joined a church originating from Korea called Church of God situated in Tai Seng. Most of the word online calls the church a ""cult""; it believes in God the Father and God the Mother. It worried me for a while, but he told me he was so happy that he found that church and was convinced by the evidence he was presented to justify the church's belief. He was so truly happy he found such a purpose in life that he made me promise that if I would ever return to Christianity, I must visit his church before anywhere else.

They made their decision because they are financially able, and their relationship is stable. (Rhymes!)  OR...  Parents who stupidly shoot the sperm inside and accidentally got pregnant so they hastily get married and begrudgingly keep the child? Even if they have only been dating for a month, or if they don't have the financial capability to raise a kid? After that they throw the kid to grandparents to take care.   This isn't a true comparison. If asking would I prefer a crack-addicted single mother over two wealthy and well-adjusted gay men, I'd have to be really messed up to not believe the latter is better for the child. However, what if all things were equal. No difference between the gay couple or the straight couple. Same occupation, same income, etc. Which would be chosen?"
singapore,3c99pj,jollybot,2,Mon Jul 6 05:21:52 2015 UTC,"Are there many people who are actively intolerant? Very seldom do I meet someone who is outright against it. Most people seem indifferent. Even the person she is saying is anti-gay marriage posted something regarding how they must accept gay marriage.   Actually, the person she referenced regular posts things that are rather anti-gay. This was mentioned in the post.   This blogger is no better than BuzzFeed, Gawker, etc., and is just using the cause de jour to generate fake controversy for clicks.   That has been how XX operates, but that doesn't mean there's no validity to her post. I frequently see many of the cliched arguments against same sex marriage that she debunks, and while her writing may not be to your liking, her rebuttals do contain some degree of cogency. It's just a little uppity to dismiss the post entirely just because certain part are a little sensationalist.   This isn't a true comparison. If asking would I prefer a crack-addicted single mother over two wealthy and well-adjusted gay men, I'd have to be really messed up to not believe the latter is better for the child. However, what if all things were equal. No difference between the gay couple or the straight couple. Same occupation, same income, etc. Which would be chosen?   The argument against allowing same sex couples to adopt is that it will have an adverse effect on children. In the first paragraph alone, she links to sources that debunks that claim.  I agree that her argument makes a few sweeping assumptions, but it raises a good point though. We don't screen straight couples for competency at raising a child before allowing them to have one, and since same-sex couples are held to a much higher standard and screened thoroughly before being allowed to adopt children, what exactly is the opposition to same sex couples adopting based on?  The last part of your argument also isn't a true comparison, because we live in the reality where more kids are given up for adoption than there are couples willing to adopt. Personally, I'd rather they find a good home that wants and is able to provide for their needs than remain orphaned, even if that home doesn't fit your view of what a family nucleus should be."

singapore,3c651r,omkaram,4,Sun Jul 5 04:52:31 2015 UTC,"I think one factor they're really neglecting is that kids nowadays aren't really interested in football, or anything involving physical activity. They keep trying to promote technology in schools and everywhere, and children are used to instant entertainment from technology where they don't really have to put in effort for a reward. Kids nowadays just don't have the same lifestyle so it's an uphill battle to interest them in football.    It sounds weird, but I rmb talking to a few guys here on separate occasions, and I found it really weird that they didn't watch football. Football is one of the things I grew up with, and it was generally assumed that every guy watched football and supported a club. It was a bit of a culture shock for me that most (I was told) people nowadays don't grow up watching football. Kids these days prefer to play computer games or something instead."

We used to be able to pick up our ball and move to another patch of grass if we didn't like playing with people we don't like. But now they build only one street soccer court some place else forcing the kids to play with the big boys.   football isn't unpopular here. Every week my friend and i can hardly find pitches to play at the futsal places. But the prices for these places are not for kids..

Our more successful footballing era (before we have foreign talents) were many years back when the national team had a race ratio closer to that of the country's population. I'm not saying which race is better (you know what I mean), but something must be wrong if we have so little Singaporean chinese in the squad. There are many reasons of course; social, economic blah blah. One of which I feel strongly about is that many parents wouldn't want their kids to play football professionally. As such we have so little pool to pick from, and many good student players would quit playing competitively to pursue studies. I still believe given the right strategy, we can achieve much better, there are many small nations in the top 100 ranking."

singapore,3c39g9,siaoginazakum,-5,Sat Jul 4 17:26:57 2015 UTC,Surely you cannot be serious. It might be a boring place to visit but Stonehenge was built around 4000 years ago.  No one is saying it is not a pretty garden. It is whether it should belong to the UNESCO list which is a very limited list. If this garden is in then all other similar gardens around the world should be accepted on the list. There are 37 heritage sites around South East Asia. That's not that many. I don't think a botanical garden belongs among those.   why are you so guys so against everything that our nation has achieved?   Such a xenophobic nonsense comment.
singapore,3c39g9,sleepyhead,12,Sat Jul 4 18:26:06 2015 UTC,How is that even xenophobic? I am just being frank from my experience. People online always put down achievements and sort of Singapore's achievements simply because it is not as great as compared to other great places..      This garden is probably listed under UNESCO because of its history.. it spans way back before the war even starts to the generation where Sim Stamford Raffles was still kickin' ..     Surely Singapore's botanic garden isn't as historically rich as a Romanian 5000 year old  era vampire mansion but it is what it is. Just imo I feel that it is one of the most culturally rich place in Singapore (not that this nation is as culturally rich as China's one) but for once can we appreciate things for what it is?    Cheers mate.

Singaporeans are too critical of the government these days, and mostly it is because it's 'cool' to not like the government.

And you're seriously comparing the Stonehenge, a world-renowned site that has been around for thousands of years, to the botanic garden? Some people travel to the UK only because they want to see Stonehenge in real life (despite how unimpressive it is to those of us who've been there).

singapore,3c39g9,siaoginazakum,-9,Sun Jul 5 15:34:29 2015 UTC,Your comment was clearly made because I am not Singaporean. It's generalising nationalistic bullshit. I think Singapore is fantastic. I think all countries in the world have a lot to learn about how the Singaporean state works. But it's still just a garden.

singapore,3c39g9,cowbungaa,5,Sat Jul 4 23:05:26 2015 UTC,"Well one reason would be because it is in South East Asia?  I don't think 1022 sites is that much. There are almost 200 countries. And places like Greece, Italy, Iran, Egypt, China, India obviously have a lot of historical sites with great significance. Thus 1022 still means that the entry to be listed is quite high. I do recognise that this botanical garden is both nice and of historical importance, I just don't think it should be on the UNESCO list."

(10 December 1855 – 24 October 1956) was an English botanist and geologist.  Born at West Harling Hall, Norfolk, England. Ridley was the first Scientific Director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens from 1888 to 1911.   Ridley spent many years promoting rubber as a commercial product, which he was known for being passionate; therefore, he was nicknamed ""Mad Ridley"".  In 1895, he discovered a means of tapping which did not seriously damage the rubber trees.  Ridley was also largely responsible for establishing the rubber industry on the Malay peninsula,  where he resided for twenty years before publishing, in 1930, a seminal and comprehensive work on plant dispersal. This work was the culmination of his own observations over several years, and a review of widely scattered literature on the subject.

If Singapore should get a UNESCO site then why not some of the streets in Little India or Chinatown? This garden, it's just a fairly nice park.

This garden, it's just a fairly nice park. I mean, not saying it's not a nice garden but it just shouldn't be on the UNESCO list.   So you think you're a better judge of what's worthy of being a UNESCO site than UNESCO THEMSELVES? Ok.   This means that all other similar gardens around the world should be included.   That's like saying all rock formations should be a UNESCO site because Stonehenge is one. It's a silly argument that doesn't make sense, because it ignores the unique historical significance of Stonehenge and the Singapore Botanic Gardens."
singapore,3c39g9,cowbungaa,-3,Sat Jul 4 23:01:42 2015 UTC,The point is this: it is a fairly limited list. I don't think the historical value of this botanical garden is higher than a lot of other places that are not on the list. With places like this on the list it really degrades the importance of a UNESCO site.  There are lots of places that have historical value in regards to trade. And most botanical gardens feature a unique garden landscape.   So you think you're a better judge of what's worthy of being a UNESCO site than UNESCO THEMSELVES? Ok.   Well with the way I am arguing; obviously yes. In the same way I feel I am a better judge than the UN security council in many political decisions.  I do however think it is great that parks and other places become protected. So the botanical garden will be kept as it is and not developed into a condo.

What I usually do is that I'll click on the bus number that I'm on so that it shows the whole list of bus stops on the bus route. Beside each bus stop is the estimated arrival time and it's just a matter of tapping the boxes after the bus stop you boarded to find which stop says ""Arriving"" to figure out which stop you're currently at.  Pro tip: If you're going to an unfamiliar bus stop, tap the eta box of your destination first. If you feel lost during the bus ride, after using the method above to find out where you currently are, you can easily see how many stops more you are from your destination. Really helps when you don't feel confident in counting down bus stops or don't want to waste battery to turn on gps.   Tl;dr: Tap the box on Sg Buses to find ""Arr"" to get the bus stop you are at."

singapore,3c4oyc,jollybot,0,Mon Jul 6 10:10:18 2015 UTC,"6-years actually. After their first 3-year sentence, they are offered the opportunity to serve NS, if they decline, it's another 3-year sentence."
singapore,3c4oyc,Vooshka,3,Mon Jul 6 10:22:05 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about this? It wasn't like this when I was serving as an MP 15 years ago. Back then they had to serve 1 year after their first court-martial, after which they'd be given the option to recant and serve NS, or else serve an additional 2 years in DB for a total of 3 years."
singapore,3c4oyc,ketsugi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:45:41 2015 UTC,"I thought it was 3 years & 3 months too. There are 2 phases of court martial, as you said. The first is for 15 months, the next is for another 24 months.  Used to see them doing morning area-cleaning outside after the SAFDB was built. I was doing sentry duty next door, in Kranji Camp (now Mowbray Camp)."
singapore,3c4oyc,sjioldboy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:00:45 2015 UTC,"From my recollection it was 36 months (the max sentence in DB without getting sent to QRP) with (I think) 12 months remission and a recharge. However, half-way through they changed it to 36 months with no remission and a recharge since they were considered to be unrepentant SUS's. This also absolves the JW's from any reservist obligations. There have been NSMen who converted post-NSF and they got the same sentence.   They have the option to recant at anytime and to begin serving NS.  However, that may have changed to the more lenient system you remember."

One million people believe in a magical man in the sky, they're a religion and now they get to impose their views on others"
singapore,3c4oyc,DingyWarehouse,6,Sun Jul 5 01:52:30 2015 UTC,"When the word cult is usually used colloquially, it's in reference to organizations where they try to cut members off from outside society, from family, etc etc.  Mainstream religions are usually relatively open by comparison, they don't tell you to stop talking to your atheist brother or to stop living with people who aren't in the same religion etc."

singapore,3c4oyc,Heazen,3,Sun Jul 5 08:44:55 2015 UTC,How much they're willing to do what the government tells them to do.
singapore,3c4oyc,AveLucifer,6,Mon Jul 6 04:48:58 2015 UTC,"The Constitution provides that every citizen or person in the country has a constitutional right to profess, practice, or propagate his or her religious belief so long as such activities do not breach any other laws relating to public order, public health, or morality.   The type of religion doesn't matter, no one is preferred over another...unless it goes against the government or is deemed harmful to the society. Jehova's Witnesses is banned because the members refused to swear allegiance to the state and participate in military service.   The bottom line is, the government can make use of loopholes in the laws to screw any cult religions over so long as it is necessary, this includes de-registering such religions, putting a fine on public gathering of members, confiscating materials etc.   ""You can practise it in your own home, but once you go public, we will make life extremely difficult for you."" That's how it rolls. The freedom of religion is guaranteed unless the government is shat on."

singapore,3c4oyc,statelesspirate,2,Sun Jul 5 03:52:16 2015 UTC,It's more like a freemium philosophy
singapore,3c4oyc,evilplushie,2,Mon Jul 6 15:04:22 2015 UTC,Nah I beg to differ. Scientology has beliefs too. Like many other religions out there it should and can also be considered a religion. Just because Scientology is publicized weirdly by the media one does not have to succumb to saying that it's not a religion when it clearly is a religion.
singapore,3c4oyc,statelesspirate,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:01:17 2015 UTC,"Freedom of freedom has a few restrictions in Singapore. The Unification Church and Jehovah's Witnesses are proscribed in Singapore. The situation of the latter is more complex but the restrictions usually come into play for being detrimental to racial/religious harmony or the social contract as defined by the government.   Scientology probably wouldn't get in trouble since while it has acted against the US government, particularly in Operation Whiteout, there's a lack of a similar history in Singapore that they would seek to suppress. If the government sees it as potentially destabilising, then it's a whole other can of worms."
singapore,3c4oyc,dtwn,-1,Mon Jul 6 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"since freedom of religion is like a massive thing for SG   I'm kind of amazed that somebody would think this. I can't think of any metric where Singapore would score in the top half of religious freedom by country. All gatherings involving religion require a permit, some religions are banned, as are some religious text (Scientology texts being one of those).   Sure, if you want to practice a popular and state approved religion, you're free to do so. But that's not exactly religious freedom."
singapore,3c4oyc,EnjoysMangal,3,Sun Jul 5 01:03:52 2015 UTC,"The freedom of religion is circumscribed in Singapore - in some ways it is a freedom to internally profess a faith - which is a little ludicrous since even the most draconian state cannot take away your freedom to believe in something. The Supreme Court has held before that while no limits are placed on what religion you profess, religious activities, materials etc. and religious proselytization can be limited. It's a tough balance to strike - on one hand this freedom cannot be emaciated, and on the other hand it cannot become too broad or religious groups may be given special treatment under the guise of constitutional freedoms"

singapore,3c71ks,DrugRaised,5,Sun Jul 5 13:49:16 2015 UTC,"Just because it isn't labelled ""Made in the USA"" doesn't mean it isn't authentic. It says on Oakley's site that some of their products aren't made in the States. Oakley, and a whole bunch of other brands of sunglasses, are owned by Luxottica, which has a monopoly in the market. It is not uncommon for various brands under the same conglomerate to merge/share similar manufacturing facilities, as it allows for cost reduction.  Also, I highly doubt that Tangs will risk 80+ years of reputation by selling bootleg items. If you're afraid of getting cheated, then just stick to the reputable stores and chains."

singapore,3c71ks,gyrfalcons,3,Sun Jul 5 14:28:43 2015 UTC,"Well, according to their own website...   Is Oakley eyewear made in the U.S.A?  All Oakley eyewear is designed and engineered in California and it has been that way since 1975. In addition to manufacturing at Oakley's interplanetary headquarters in Foothill Ranch, California, some eyewear components and finished products are also manufactured in facilities owned and operated by our parent company, Luxottica Group, or by select 3 supply partners around the world.  Can Oakley eyewear be stamped with a marking other than ""Made in the U.S.A.?""  Yes. In addition to manufacturing at Oakley's interplanetary headquarters in Foothill Ranch, Caifornia., some eyewear components and finished products are also manufactured in facilities owned and operated by our parent company, Luxottica Group, or by select supply partners around the world. Oakley eyewear purchased from Oakley authorized retailers is authentic Oakley product that meets our rigorous standards for quality and performance.  Why has Oakley expanded its optical manufacturing outside of the United States?  All manufacturing facilities utilized in producing Oakley eyewear are efficient and consistently demonstrate their ability to produce the high quality products that customers have come to expect from Oakley. The process for selecting a manufacturing source is based in part on the competencies of the facility for the specific Oakley eyewear product.   So pretty sure it's fine and the ones you looked at are legit."

The ones where you use for casual skype and gaming or those that people use to do recordings for youtube videos? Because if you're going for the casual skype mic... I'd just go on ebay to get one of those $5 ones or one of those simlim shops which sells them for under 10. I swear i saw one of them at Valore which is sort of owned or is actually a rebranded challenger...   If you're looking at mics for professional use.. Its going to go for more than 50...

singapore,3c78tv,EH_DONT_LEH,6,Sun Jul 5 15:12:34 2015 UTC,"Didn't study business but generally, local universities aren't very poly friendly.    It starts even before you enter uni. Unlike your 'A' level peers, your 'O' level grades contribute 20% to your university admission score. Some poly courses allow module exemptions of up to a year's worth. IMO, it's a double-edge sword at best. On closer inspection, the courses you are exempted from are mostly the electives (the easier modules). Sometimes, they do cut some core year 1 modules. Sometimes, you have to take bridging courses. Sometimes, this creates a headache of planning special programmes (SEP,uTown,minor programmes...) Okay, so you don't mind taking the full 4 year course. (Not uncommon for poly students to take Arts related courses) It's not a problem although economically speaking, you lose 1 year's worth of income/experience. I guess this apply more to the technical courses... Do keep in mind that these are research universities and academic brains are preferred. Poly may give you the hard industry skills but most modules are very theoretical and academic."

singapore,3c78tv,Futurol,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:13:18 2015 UTC,"It depends on the courses and universities. I'll only link the source for business related courses.   My example refers to NUS which exempts 8MCs (about 2 modules) of ULR and 12 MCs (about 3 modules) of UEM. 'Mainstream' undergraduates usually use these to count for the special programmes without increasing their workload. NBS and SMU are slightly less 'generous' and require you to read them all anyway.  As for SIT, exemptions are case-by-case basis.

singapore,3c78tv,MMApple,2,Mon Jul 6 02:34:44 2015 UTC,"I'm from a biz-related course in poly and went on to a biz course in a local uni (graduated a couple of years back). Entered as a normal year 1 student without any exemptions.  Not sure how much details you are looking for regarding coping in uni, but in general I did pretty ok and graduated with decent grades. Believe that's the case for my poly friends too! I've always been the study-last-min kind of student so the biggest challenge for me in uni was being consistent. If you need further details let me know!  On tips for getting into uni, the most important one is to keep your grades up. Aim for the Dean's list and maintain your GPA above 3.7. My GPA was much lower than that so I suppose my O level grades made up for it. Never did participate much in CCAs throughout my poly life.   As for how to get good grades in poly, study smart, not hard. Know what works for you. I used to always wait till the exam period to start cramming cause it helps me remember things better. Always try to look for past year papers to do, and get your tutors to look through your answers if possible. Listen out for hints during lectures. Find good project mates to work with so that you capitalise on each member's strengths (your good friends may not necessarily be the best people to work with). Make sure you understand the content taught, otherwise find a way to get help.  Side on on it being easier to get into uni through the A level route: Largely true, as most of the seats in uni are ""reserved"" for A level students, but I believe that you should always play to your strengths. I did a year in JC and if I had continued, I would never have gotten a place in uni.  Hope this helps and all the best with your studies! :)"

singapore,3c78tv,mminsy,2,Thu Jul 9 14:32:13 2015 UTC,"I'm from biz in poly. Most of my friends in biz continued on doing biz.   1) yes, you need a high GPA. The ones I know - min 3.6 but above 3.7 is a safe bet. It starts from day one. Do your schoolwork. Study. If unsure, ask tutors. Email the heck out of them. But if you do badly in first sem, ALL IS NOT LOST, don't give up. I have a friend who scored 2.8 in his first sem, he pulled up his socks and graduated w 3.66 GPA and got a placement in NUS.   2) beef up your portfolio. Join CCAs such as biz sch society, whatever other society and clubs. Land yourself in the committee and have a leadership role.   3) get reccomendation letters from tutors, cca advisors and even your previous employers from intern or part time work. build relationships w them.   4) participate in voluntary activities inside and outside sch to make yourself well-rounded   5)  take part in business competitions! Ask your tutors if they know any or do a quick google search ;)   Hope this helps somehow!"

If you do make it to uni, don't make the mistake of thinking your jc peers are better than you or vice versa. You are all on equal ground. Uni is just as hard on both parties  Study smart. Figure out the best studying habits for yourself and carry that to uni. Never study for grades but study to learn.   Be humble and learn what you can from those better than you.

singapore,3c78tv,mminsy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:32:16 2015 UTC,"Hello,  I was previously from poly and went to uni.  So long your results is good enough in poly (mine was around 3.8+), pretty sure you can qualify for uni. I have friends who didn't participate actively in CCA but still made it to university. With my GPA, I didn't go for business course though I was previously from a business faculty. Reason being was a change in interest but only to realize it was too tough for me since it was science related. Imagine you study biz 3 years and forgot all about the sciences you learned back in secondary and suddenly, thrown back to a science environment. The brain really couldn't take it so I transferred back to business.  Well, I would say you might have some advantage in the first semester due to the exposure to presentations and the knowledge of certain modules back in poly. However, after a semester pass, everyone is pretty much on the same level. I would say I've learned a lot in poly but was expose more in uni due to the different people I've met. The way they talk in class and how they present their ideas are something worth learning since I can't really think on the spot so I struggled with class participation.   All in all, just work damn hard in poly if you want to go to uni! :)"

Getting good CCA standing is important, but ultimately your grades still hold final sway.  I have poly friends that finished a whole year earlier than me, but they had to take on more classes than the normal students. This can affect your grades if you can't handle the workload. I'm finishing half a year earlier than my batch people, but at a more leisurely pace. The number of modules you are exempted from depends on what you take in poly and how relevant it is to your uni course."

Mobile column, we were parked at Kallang Leisure Park before the first rehearsal of the day. This isn't unexpected, given that my unit strongly discouraged (i.e. forbid) us from loitering inside the mall to blow air con.  Most of the NDP/NS personnel aren't there to shop (and can't anyway). Apart from heading to 7-11, they're not going to go anywhere else in the mall. Instead, they'll hog all the seats, throw away their trash inside the mall (we saw photos of an amazing amount of litter) and absolutely rape the toilets. Not to mention going to eat at the mall instead of the indented outrations, resulting in food wastage."

Most of the time, the parade personnel would always be standing by their vehicles doing maintenance/checks/posing for photos anyway. At the start, we weren't outright banned from entering the mall, but was just strongly discouraged.  In 2010, the big issue that actually got us forbidden from going inside the mall was both the logistics personnel in charge of setting up the staging area and small groups of NS parade personnel sneaking off into the mall to enjoy the aircon, and they left a lot of litter behind (and stuffing the mall's dustbins with out-ration boxes).

singapore,3c2fpo,btcprox,3,Sat Jul 4 03:25:31 2015 UTC,"I'm really curious what the government's plan here is. Reducing carbon emissions in Singapore won't be easy - traditionally the biggest emitters are transport and energy. The government has done almost nothing to help with either of those - no big push for hybrids or infrastructure for electric cars, and the existing CNG station coverage is very poor. There also don't seem to be a huge amount of room for energy, given that most renewables aren't accessible to Singapore, and while the EMA has plans for increasing solar to 5% of Singapore's peak power usage by 2020 and seem to have introduced the option for consumers with excess solar power to sell them back to SP, it doesn't seem to be enough"
singapore,3c2fpo,mediumdeviation,1 point,Sat Jul 4 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"Actually what you said suggests that achieving the target is possible. Bear in mind that the target of emissions intensity is measured on per unit GDP.  More public transport can reduce emissions per unit GDP compared to cars.   As for energy, Singapore is still using lots of fossil fuels, so any movement towards renewables or coal will improve emissions intensity."
singapore,3c2fpo,palysg,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:25:40 2015 UTC,"The pledge suggests both a reduction of carbon intensity to 36% below 2005 levels (I believe, though I need the stats to back this up, that Singapore's carbon intensity has been decreasing for a while now, so this seems plausible, as you said) and to stop total emission from growing by 2030, which seems much less plausible, because the government still expect the population to grow, which means a much lower per capita emissions level, and that doesn't seem possible without some radical changes to the way transport and energy in Singapore are produced."

singapore,3c2fpo,NO_LAH_WHERE_GOT,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:15:55 2015 UTC,"Lets see, Singapore used 46TWh in 2014. Which is an average of 5248 MW of power needed. From a google search it seems modern PV can get around 90 MW/km2. Which means around 60 km2 of land is needed. So it seems we could use solar for a large fraction of our energy needs if we really wanted to.  I actually find it kind of strange that we don't see more solar on private housing. With our sky high electricity prices and super strong sun the ROI is probably really low. So why aren't more people installing solar and why aren't there companies aggressively selling residential solar?"
singapore,3c2fpo,iemfi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:04:59 2015 UTC,"Solar Business Owner here.  Solar power is still expensive with a long ROI for residential customers unless there are government subsidies/rebates in place (most other countries have them).  Having said that, there are many opportunities for commercial solar installation which are being overlooked.  For example shopping malls have large roof spaces.  Although the shop tenants have to pay for their own electricity, the mall owner/management still have to pay for building infrastructure such as lighting/escalators/aircon.  Solar installations would offset or even cancel these costs.  Likewise HDBs have significant roof surfaces which could also be tapped (by the government/SP in this case) to push additional daytime power into the grid.  There are many opportunities for solar power out there... it's a pity residential, commercial, and government consumers are not considering it."
singapore,3c2fpo,Luo_Yi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:58:59 2015 UTC,"How long is long? I've invested heavily in Solar City and they claim a ROI of around 10 years. And it seems around half the cost is installation costs. With labour much cheaper here, our tropical sun, high electricity prices, and year round requirement for air con shouldn't the ROI be much less than that here?   I mean it seems the return you would get from installing panels would be much higher than the 7% average from normal investment. So what happened to the efficient market. Why aren't you aggressively selling solar to residential houses?"
singapore,3c2fpo,iemfi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 11:06:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with solar city, but an ROI should be less than 10 years anyway (most of that is material not labour).  A 10 year ROI may not sound that bad to you, but to most (short sighted) residential consumers it is far too long.    I am trying to aggressively sell to residential customers (in other Asian countries... not SG), but they generally:   don't trust a $4000 up front investment which will take years to ROI don't trust the 20 year manufacturer's warranty (the products come from China) don't have a government RETS incentive to buy any excess power they make don't trust that it is ""legal"" because they don't see any of their neighbours using it and they are afraid the electric company will tell them they cannot (after they have spend $$$$ on it) don't want to be the first to do it (basic, general distrust)   There are other reasons too, but that is generally what I see.

Giving more opportunities for higher education. Bursary amounts have also increased for uni students. The public universities have also been kept on a 18% cap on international students. On top of that, its now harder for foreign students to find employment/get PR after graduating. Signalling that more graduate jobs are going to Singaporeans instead. Local universities are also expanding, providing new courses for a diverse student population.   As a university student, these are the things that concern me.

Air-conditioned business centres built in SAF camps to cater to the working needs of reservist personnel, with Internet access and PC terminals housed. Increased the IPPT incentive by $100 across all levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold). New IPPT consisting of only 3 stations (easier to pass in some sense). Flexible schemes for RT personnel (those who failed their IPPT), even allowing them to carry out their training sessions in the parks around the CBD (instead of travelling to military camps).

singapore,3c1h29,ARE_U_FUCKING_SORRY,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:27:05 2015 UTC,"well, my suggestion would be to get 2 different ones. IEMs for running, headphones for csgo.   for running IEMs, there's one from Klipsh that i tried that were quite good, and they're sweat and moisture resistant. I personally just use my RHA MA750 for running. They're brilliant in both sound and build quality, but its above your price range, 120ish off of amazon.   For headphones with a mic, at that price, maybe a bit more, Kingston HyperX, or Steel Series Siberia V2 (not the v3s, they've got a ton of build and software issues), plus, the v2 are going for about 120ish right now.   Alternatively, what are you using now? It's not unheard of to just get a cheap desktop mic or clip on mic and use that with what you have currently."

My foreign gf is really struggling to find a job here :( The problem is that her work experience is just as an English teacher (not in a school) and call center work, and S-pass jobs are really tough to get nowadays without handing over like 2 months salary and lying to MOM etc (it's shocking what these agents recommend!). She's also a qualified nurse but with very little hospital experience so she hasn't had luck finding a nursing job even though there are a lot of open positions.  Any tips? She's currently training to be an insurance agent in the hopes of getting a visa doing that, but she was really hoping to work in healthcare.  I really want her to stay in Singapore.. :("

This is how I got a job here without any work experience. I didn't use any agents (stay away from them). It took me about 1.5 month to find one.

To be on the safe side I would advise you to try your best to get good results for the current and next semester to pull up your GPA as much as possible. The first thing they will look at is your GPA when considering your application but that is just the first step and ultimately whether you get in depends on how well your interview goes so it would be good for you to ask some of your seniors who are in SIT about the interview process/things to look out for.

I don't follow local politics, but I imagine it not easy for the average Singaporean to tell whether a Minister is more capable than the other ministers. To clarify, I am not saying that Tharman is not capable. But how do you tell he is more capable than say, his opposite number Teo Chee Hean?   edit: Follow up question: Tharman seems to be popular among younger people, with the word ""capable"" being used most often to describe him. Followers of local politics, why do you like Tharman?"

singapore,3byzq0,hamsalamibacon,9,Sat Jul 4 03:03:19 2015 UTC,"The younger SGians like him because he sounds capable. Is there any way we can gauge his actual capability to run a country? Look at what he has done in his portfolios as Finance Minister, Education and even earlier. Then decide for yourself.   I do know that he is very highly regarded by foreign politicians and economists in particular."
singapore,3byzq0,hamsalamibacon,13,Fri Jul 3 10:09:24 2015 UTC,"From what I recall (ie, this needs checking), he was finance minister during the 2008-09 global financial crisis and so oversaw some of the more novel schemes rolled out to tide Singapore over that period: jobs credit, wage credit. Also, significant changes to workfare + making taxes more progressive these past few years."
singapore,3byzq0,hamsalamibacon,4,Fri Jul 3 12:11:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, a lot of the jobs/employee training packages were suggested or even practiced by unions before the government implemented them en masse. If anything, it shows Tharman is a Minister who knows how to take in and implement good policies. Which is what all our Ministers do anyways."
singapore,3byzq0,hamsalamibacon,6,Fri Jul 3 12:38:22 2015 UTC,"Agree about taking in/implementing good policies. But I think MOF/govt (if not a single minister) can take a bit more credit for the ones mentioned above. Jobs credit scheme wasn't about training right? It was about saving jobs during the recession. S$4.5b to pay employers to retain Singaporean workers (they got a % of the first xx of each employees' pay I think). Quite a bold move, since companies that weren't suffering would get the cash too - but it worked, unemployment stayed low."
singapore,3byzq0,neatoli_,6,Fri Jul 3 12:59:27 2015 UTC,"Agreed.   Anyways in my opinion I'm largely supportive of all our Ministers because they focus on solving problems, not focusing on stupid politicking that goes on in the West."

singapore,3byzq0,flyingfudge,4,Fri Jul 3 16:02:58 2015 UTC,"Look at what he has done in his portfolios as Finance Minister, Education and even earlier.   This is exactly what I am inquiring about. People say he did a good job. I don't doubt that, but referring to his portfolio alone isn't a good enough explanation. In that regard, could you as a Tharman admirer, offer some examples of the high points of his administrative efforts at various government bodies?  From a quick gander at his Wikipedia page I would agree that he is highly regarded outside of Singapore.  Back to my earlier point, which was not to question Tharman's credentials. I was curious about why Tharman seems to have the most support. Where are the Teo Chee Hean fanboys?"

I honestly don't know about his performance in the ministries, although one can point to the phasing out of the streaming system as a plus point for his term as Education minister. As for his time currently at MoF, seems okay with no blips.   I had the pleasure of speaking to some foreign dignitaries during a forum I worked at a few months back and they all had glowing praise for him and LHL.   I think it's a bit weird for SGians to call for a politician to be PM purely because he/she sounds good, especially given SG govt's practical realist stance from day 1. Look at Greece for that end result."

singapore,3bzkci,kanev91,11,Tue Jul 7 15:33:57 2015 UTC,"So does this mean I don't count as Singaporean?    So i found an old comment I put here on /r/singapore about some stuff K Shanmugam said, the comment is reproduced in part below:  2 relevant clips on youtube, both featuring a talk given Minister K Shanmugam at NUS in 2013.  The fundamental issue here I thought was explained rather well by him in this clip: Defining the quality of life; How much do we need to be happy?  I extracted the stuff he said that starts at around 4:45 in that clip.   ...if you were a Buddhist or a Hindu or many of the other religions you could say, 'I really don't need any of these things, any of the material benefits - happiness is a state of mind'.   It is indeed a state of mind. But do you think as a minister I can go out there and tell someone who doesn't have a job, doesn't have a house, or doesn't have some things that he wants and tell him or her that, 'you know, it's a state of mind, you really ought not to be unhappy'. Shall we redefine the paradigm and say to you, 'why don't you just try and be happy with whatever little you have. It's got to come from inside.'  I'm one of those who believes that happiness comes from inside here. The moment you say, 'I need this, I need that, I need that', you get that car you think you're going to be happy? Somebody's got a bigger car. You want this particular type of house, someone's got a bigger house. So you'll never be happy so long as you look for positional goods.  But as a government, I cannot impose my personal values. I cannot say to people, 'oh you shouldn't be striving for this, striving for that'. My role is to provide a framework where everyone strives to the extent of their wishes and there will be many who will say like you, 'I don't need to, I'm quite happy taking a different path.' I've had lawyers in my firm after two years who has come to me and say, 'I wanna do something else'. I understand entirely. But what does a government do? We can only provide a framework. I can't tell people don't do this or do that.  And at the same time we have to make sure that we instil of course the right values system.  ...   There's another clip about Can Singapore Slow Down? which I thought was a natural complement to the first clip.  And for those with the time the full talk is available here. It's 2 hours long but I found it very worth the watch; although for many it might be nothing new.  also, another clip from that talk: Does earning more equate to happiness?    interesting eh."

So if you triple that it hurts, but it's no biggie, only a fraction of their gross income. They'll probably have a net gain from the increased taxes since the money will probably go into programs which benefit them.  On the other hand the median household spends most of their income on stuff which has GST. Tripling the GST means they now have to pay 14% more for that stuff.   I think taxing capital gains is a bad idea for more complicated reasons. This is something which Singapore gets very right."

One solution is to copy the Nordic countries, and that is where the work life balance thing comes in.  But is it possible to increase procreation without following the Nordic countries.  Yes, but they all require money and sacrifice.  One solution is to copy Israel, which allow free IVF for all families, provides free day care etc. Another solution is the Iranian solution is to ban contraceptives (they actually subsidize them before), restrict women to less marketable degrees and give make firms give preferences in hiring and promotion to married women with 2 or more children.  Throwing the kitchen sink at the problem would say, ""The fertility rate must be increased to 2.0 in 10 years, no expense will be spared and will use some very creative solutions. Here is throwing the kitchen sank.  1) Women have to serve in the SAF.  People will only able to end their SAF service if they get married and when the first child is born.  Special provisions will be made for couples who are infertile, they will be assigned a child to adopt.  2) People who have more than 2 children will be exempt from reserve duty.  3) Restrictions on abortions  4) Pay single women who get prego to have the baby. The baby will be setup for adoption or the upkeep will be subsidized by the state.  5) Free fertility treatments  6) Promote birth tourism.  7) Give priority in hiring and promotion to married women with 2 or more children over all others.  This is putting the procreation above wealth creation.    Someone is going to be inconvenienced or its going to cost money, and a lot of money. There is no getting around it.  The problem is when people are inconvenienced, Singaporeans are more likely to leave, than say an Israeli or Iranian."

As to whether this means there's an immediate right to counsel, the Court of Appeal said in James Raj v Public Prosecutor, a 2014 case:   ...an arrested person who wished to consult a legal practitioner of his choice was entitled to have this constitutional right granted to him by the authority having custody of him within a reasonable time after his arrest...  ...what a “reasonable time” would be, it could be surmised that an allowance for police investigations and procedure was intended to be incorporated within the framework of a “reasonable time”..."

To have diversity allows differing opinions to be heard, prevents group think, engagement across social-political group, awareness of social preferences, and increase adaptability to changing situations.  Of course, you would maintain the ruling party has encompass all that. But this is changing the role of diversity as not important to something internalized by the party.

Back then the Christian Brothers Mission published school annuals that included all class photos of its primary & secondary schools (the graduating students were also identified). Someone like me in Pri. 1 at St. Anthony's Boys was in the same periodical as the Sec. 4 guys in SJI.  So I got to spend my school years researching my yearbook collection for these seniors after they became public figures. Initially, these were younger SJI alumni like Dick Lee, Leong Kok Fann/Lim Tang Boon (national footballers) etc., although I never got around to checking for the Flying Dutchman, Jeremy Monteiro, etc. who became famous later. I don't know them personally, but got the impression that they all hailed from the pai kia side of SJI lol. (Kok Fann did captain a lot of teams, as I vague recall & have always admired about.)  When I got to SJI, I went to the school library & looked up older CBS school annuals, even managed to buy a couple of these later at the second-hand stores in Bras Basah Complex. The classes from this early-1970s era produced the opposite: i.e. high-fliers like George Yeo, Teo Chee Hean, Matthias Yao, Charles Chong, et al. (It was a delight to find their schoolboy faces, I tell you.) Davinder was their peer (I didn't get to look him up) & is clearly a very smart man, so I was wondering why Goh Chok Tong didn't take advantage of that. Maybe his current profession is indeed his true calling."

Imo it's just a lazier and less crisp pronunciation that can in some ways feel less Chinese [i.e. you'd cringe if the news were read like Singdarin]. Kinda like how many people say Singlish isn't English.   Although I guess there are many Singaporeans that have the capability to try to sound more 'standard' (e.g. like a mediacorp newscaster or pretend they're in some theatrical production).  In my experience, ironically I found that for the people I know whose main exposure of Mandarin is from school lessons, it's less of an issue for them cause their accent will lie closer to the standard; whereas if you also use it in daily conversation with other Singaporeans (esp the older generation) then you may end up with the 'incorrect' accent that is more 'dialect' (Min, Yue varieties) influenced. So people in the latter category may have that kinda stilted, unnatural/artificial accent if they try to do 'standard'. Of course I can't generalise for those who come from more educated backgrounds; I wouldn't suppose any of this applies.  It's different for Singlish, for practical purposes Singlish isn't accepted as just another accent."

You can feel when someone is Singaporean. You can sense it from across the room. I think being Singaporean is knowing when to complain, and who to complain to. And knowing what to complain about. For example, take our reaction to the AMAgeddon. We talked about it in the daily thread, and had some differing opinions, but as far as I know we aren't going to shut down the sub for it.

In other words, becoming Singaporean means becoming a bigger person even though Singapore is a small country. Needless to say, those of us who are already citizens should also manifest this same largeness of mind and spirit.   edit: not that I have to point out the obvious, but this was merely one requirement, i.e. necessary but not necessarily sufficient."

ICA will issue you a passport that explicitly states on the first page it is only valid for use in Israel. I only had one occasion where the Israeli people asked me about it but I think the girl was just flirting. Cost is $70 and ICA is used to issuing it. This is also the preferred method for traveling into Israel by land as the customs officer on land may not have the paper referred in the next method.  2) No need for a separate passport. Upon entry to Israel, request the customs officer to stamp on a separate piece of paper. YOU MUST TELL THEM because they may not give a flying fuck otherwise.

singapore,3byh1t,Brikandbones,9,Fri Jul 3 04:54:11 2015 UTC,"1) Get backpack with zip on the front instead of the top. This makes it so much easier to access your stuff without pouring everything out  2) The bottom bad with straps should sit at your hip bone position, not above at the waist. This will help support the weight better  3) Spread the load evenly, not heaviest at bottom  4) Pack light, its no joke lugging a backpack up and down trains, stairways. A luggage actually works in more western Europe, so you can still switch if you want. Luggage with wheels is so much lighter on your back and legs  5) Roll up your clothes (not fold) and put into zip lock bags which you can get from Daiso or supermarket. Zip lock and squeeze all the air out to make it compact.  6) Not sure how many days you are going, pack some soap powder to wash your underwear. Then wash your clothes in your hostels' washing machine. They accept coins  7) Did i say pack light ? Since you are going in Summer, you probably just need lotsa tees and probably just 1-2 nicer shirts for fancy restaurants (if needed)  8) Survival kit - medication, torchlight etc  9) Nice pair of waterproof walking shoes.  10) Thick sweat absorbent socks. Those army PT socks are good for me  11) Some lock if you are sharing rooms in hostel with strangers.  12) Get a day bag along, most trains stations have day lockers, if you are only hanging out for a few hours in a city, chuck your backpack into the lockers and bring your day bag  13) Portable Kettle. Ok, this is controversial, it adds on to the weight. But water is still expensive in Europe, so can save $$$ to boil and bring your own water  That's all i can come up with for now."

singapore,3byh1t,hannorx,4,Fri Jul 3 05:51:21 2015 UTC,"Bring clothes that are easy to mix and match for different occasions. On my trip, I brought 5 pairs of shirts (2 polos, 2 shirts and a flannel), a pair of sleeping attire (singlet and shorts) and jeans. The shorts I used to sleep in is also casual enough to be worn if I don't feel like wearing jeans that day. You could roll the shirts as suggested by another Redditor, but I used color-coded compression sacks for clothes and other things I want to keep super dry. It keeps me organised so I don't have to rummage my backpack to find what I need.  If you intend on camping out, the compression sacks I mentioned earlier will be useful. They really reduce the size of sleeping bags/tents by so much more than the standard sacks issued.   You should have a pair of good walking shoes and sandals. If you intend on using your army boots, make sure they're in good condition. My Gortex pair fell apart halfway climbing up a mountain. It was so painful walking in it. Fortunately, a couple noticed what happened and let me borrow their extra pair of shoes.  Buy a compressible day pack that you can flatten and keep in your main backpack. Useful especially if you want to save money and are not checking in your main bag at airports. Budget airlines in Europe usually charge you extra money for the second bag onwards.   I didn't bother with toothpaste and other toiletries (except for toothbrush). The rest, I bought overseas (usually in between transits). I washed my clothes once a week. I buy the washing powder from the hostel or another backpacker (who often gives it for free, lol). These didn't cost that much anyway so I didn't mind.  Don't bring too much cash on you. I only bring enough for the day's worth and go back to the hostel/ATM if I need more. Whenever possible though, I pay everything with a credit card.   Feel free to talk to strangers. That's the best part of travelling. But be extra aware of your surroundings. I almost got scammed in Paris. Two people distracted me with a map (claiming they were tourists and wanted to go somewhere) while another searched through my back pockets. It took me some time before I realised it, but when I did realise what was happening, I went all, ""WHAT THE FUCK"" and started making a scene.   Edit: Forgot to mention. I brought a jacket too that served as a windbreaker, raincoat and to keep me warm. Also fyi, my backpack weighed 20kg altogether. More though on the flight home cos of all the goodies and souvenirs."
singapore,3byh1t,littlepinches,3,Fri Jul 3 05:49:25 2015 UTC,"Day bags are super important. You don't want to be THAT tourist.  Locks cause, hostels be nasty and humans can be just the worse sometimes. Do your laundry along the way, so bring enough clothes to last from a period of time till you'd be able to do your laundry. i recommend 3 days. So this lightens the load. A waterproof toiletry bag that packs the essentials and that you can very easily bring into the bathroom and carry everywhere with you. Ideally with some kind of an ability to be hooked.  One GOOD pair of walking shoes is enough. Stress is on GOOD. What you wear on your feet, make or break your trip. Flipflops"

Remember you'll have to take all of your things with you on your back - I would keep mine under 10kg. Only need 2-3 sets of clothes depending on climate of destination, you'll be able to wash them in a sink, river, whatever often enough.

singapore,3bybty,SausageTrance,2,Fri Jul 3 04:06:13 2015 UTC,"Here's how I did it a few years back.   1) Wait till around 2 months before ORD. It's important to give yourself some leeway because the appointment dates might be far away from the when you book. It's important you do it before your Dental FFI.  2) Call the Nee Soon Dental Centre (NSDC) for an appointment. I can't remember the number but you can try asking your camp's medical centre for the number. Don't call during lunchtime because no one will pick up. Usually the appointment will be a 2-3 weeks later.   3) Head over to NSDC (it's in the same bulding as the Nee Soon Medical Centre) and get your teeth checked by the SAF dentist. The medics will then help you to arrange an appointment at either KTPH or NUH. Head over to the respective hospital and go for another checkup there, and arrange your own dates. Your actual extraction will be maybe 1 week or so after this appointment.  4) If you're taking out all 4, your extractions will be split into 2 days, with the 2nd a week after the first."

The extraction though was a 2 months wait.. I think? If you plan on doing the extraction at one the SAF dental centres, you'll want to book early.

singapore,3bx6r0,llosa,17,Fri Jul 3 04:41:34 2015 UTC,"Reddit admins, in their infinite wisdom decided to randomly fire Victoria, an /r/iama mod who has been instrumental in organizing most if not all of the high profile AMAs. /r/science, /r/askreddit and several other major subs have gone private in protest.  I suspect it's because Victoria has been consistent about keeping AMAs free or something, whereas Reddit probably wants to monetize it. Also, the whole retarded policy about how all employees must relocate to San Fran or be fired. Because y'know, the rent in SF is totally reasonable."
singapore,3bx6r0,dreadpiratewombat,8,Fri Jul 3 01:50:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think we can make a judgement on why she was fired. For all we know, she could have done nothing wrong. For all we know, she could have been embezzling money or whatever. For all we know, she could have been martyred defending the free liberties of Reddit. The bottom line is that we don't know why she was fired, and we don't know whether she was unjustly fired."
singapore,3bx6r0,llosa,5,Fri Jul 3 04:05:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a lot of speculation going on as to why she was fired.  I don't think its helpful to add to the speculation, just to react to the asinine decision to do it without giving all the subs she was supporting fair notice so they could do a proper hand-off.  Between her being fired and an apparent ongoing lack of support by the site admins to various subs, things are getting interesting quickly."
singapore,3bx6r0,Locnil,3,Fri Jul 3 04:40:18 2015 UTC,"This shouldn't be about WE HATE PAO, this should be about 'Reddit, you have failed in your admin duties by failing to ensure a smooth transition between employees, resulting in a poor user experience.'"
singapore,3bx6r0,pm_me_for_happiness,3,Fri Jul 3 06:12:24 2015 UTC,"Indeed. But the point was, Reddit didn't even inform the /r/IAMA modteam, which were left scrambling (apparently, a celebrity was sent by his PR guy by plane to NYC or something to do it, only to find that his AMA had to be cancelled when he landed). Combined with what the mods claimed have been an increasing lack of support from the admins, many have now shut their subs down in protest. Incidentally, /r/Singapore may end up being one of them."

Would probably be better to just wait for the new 6S to be out then resell it. Problem is no doubt my phone will eventually reach a point where it needs to be replaced.

When they pushed their $50 1gbps fibre plans the other isps dropped their prices to compete - making $50 for 1gbps pretty much baseline, which my family took advantage of when we recontracted fibre to M1.  Personally I'm not exactly keen on becoming a MyRepublic customer myself - you can do a search on the teething service problems a lot of folks here and on EDMW have experienced - anecdotal, yes, but well, you'll never know which side of the anecdote you'll be on when it happens to you.   I'm hoping their plans to offer unlimited 4G data will spur the other telcos to try to match it. I don't even really need unlimited data, just that they'll take away my grandfathered 12gb 3G plan when they pry it out of my cold, dead hands."

Usually its a couple larger police boats doing what looks to be small craft interdiction.  2 large boats pursue a smaller boat, one chases, the other cuts the smaller craft off until they're in a really tight circle and the small craft has to stop.  Its been going like this for the better part of a week and is pretty neat to watch.  Today there's a group of 4 rigid hull inflatables doing what look to be coordinated maneuvers in the shallows.

singapore,3bz4ot,bitflag,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:15:25 2015 UTC,What's the source for this data? Singapore is actually below the world average in terms of CO2 emissions per capita according to the world bank.
singapore,3bz4ot,cowbungaa,3,Fri Jul 3 12:33:36 2015 UTC,Probably EIA. I think I saw the source in the original page. The problem with those numbers are that bunker fuels count as domestic energy consumption and Singapore being one of the most important bunkering hub in the world has all that consumption under our account.
singapore,3bz4ot,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:47:45 2015 UTC,"Is the EIA the only agency using that particular definition of CO2 emissions?

singapore,3bz4ot,cowbungaa,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:59:45 2015 UTC,I have no idea. Though I think your linked document explicitly excludes international bunkering from the countries' numbers but also admits that Singapore's numbers might be a little borked. CDIAC numbers (which also leaves out international bunkering)(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions_per_capita) are in the same ballpark as your linked article and also much larger than the world bank's one. Really have to dive into what's counted and what's not when you compare between sources.
singapore,3bz4ot,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzdz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:17:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess it's complicated, especially for laymen like myself. Thanks for the discussion though!"
singapore,3bz4ot,cowbungaa,0,Fri Jul 3 13:19:20 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to say it's merely the result of our geographical circumstance and fairly high average standard of living.  While some people may be right in saying that it's due to Singaporeans being some kind of energy wasting people/culture; my own experience tells me if you transplanted the average middle class European/Western standard of living and adapt it to Singapore it'd be even higher.  I've come across some people who live in temperate climates that believe air conditioning is considered a basic necessity for summer. [don't even have to talk about winter heating]  and MURICA SUVs lel.   I mean just the general waste man...   So my opinion is if anyone thinks Singaporeans are as resource wasteful as other Western countries, maaybe, but  shiiiit."
singapore,3bxre4,bimtroublemaker,3,Fri Jul 3 01:00:08 2015 UTC,"It's new enough that there is no ""standard"". Just be thorough, have plans and procedures in place in case of accidents, and be aware of the various prohibited zones.

singapore,3bwjr6,chaotarroo,5,Mon Jul 6 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"The best thing to do would be to visit a food centre. It's like a huge market with dozens of individual stores selling different food by people of different cultural background.  Some of the famous food centres in SG are Newton Food Centre, Maxwell Food Centre and Adam Food Centre.  These are all located at the central of Singapore. You can find directions by googling them.   Some other equally good ones(or even better) that are less pricey and touristy will be ABC Food Centre, Bukit Timah Food Centre, Old Airport Road Food Centre and Chomp Chomp Food Centre.  Most of these are at the outskirts of SG though.   Also, be warned that most food stores in SG aren't Halal and many of them use lard to flavour their food, especially when it's a stir-fried item. If you suspect there is any, you can always ask the store owners to remove the lard when cooking the dish, majority of them will be more than happy to do so.    Have fun in SG and enjoy the food!"
singapore,3bwjr6,Pollenset,8,Thu Jul 2 22:03:43 2015 UTC,"... Id avoid Newton. I find it over priced as its full of tourists and honestly, the food there isnt all that great.  Maxwell is awesome!  Also, Geylang rd is a favourite place to browse for edibles too!"
singapore,3bwjr6,SG50cent,2,Fri Jul 3 02:05:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't completely write off Newton for halal options.  The nasi padang stall at Newton Circus Food Centre (right at the end of the inner row of stalls) is cheap and good, plus you can take as much complimentary keropok as you like.  The nasi ayam stall directly across it has very tasty nasi ayam and nasi briyani, fresh steaming hot sambal for you to scoop onto your plate or a seperate bowl (from a heated pot), and a selection of garnishes (like fried shallots and fried chicken batter).  Try it, you won't regret it.  Edit: oxford comma etc"

singapore,3bwjr6,sporespore,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:13:12 2015 UTC,"Yup. chaotarroo's advice about food centres is pretty good. I prefer the less touristy ones he listed too, for the slightly more local atmosphere if not just for the food.  Lots of other useful comments too. One kind of food that hasn't been mentioned yet is Peranakan food, one of my favourites. It might be described as a Chinese-Malay fusion, but really it has its own identity. The best restaurant in my opinion is Peramakan at Keppel Club ($30+ per head maybe). Not sure where to find good Peranakan food in town, you'll have to Google that.  Which area will you be staying at?"

Their food is both very affordable and amazingly delicious. You can call ahead at 6291 0109 to make sure that they're open.  For the rest... I'm not sure if they're halal, but you can easily avoid the pork dishes by asking the servers.  Indian cusine: highly recommend Karu's Indian Banana Leaf Restaurant at 808 Upper Bukit Timah Rd (west side). Their number is 6762 7284.  Hokkien cusine: Beng Hiang at Block 135 Jurong Gateway Road, #02-337 (west side). You can reach them at 6221 6695/6221 6684 and their website is: http://www.benghiang.com/ (come to think of it, this restaurant may use pork lard as an ingredient, so be sure to ask before heading down).  Peranakan: PeraMakan at Level 3, Keppel Club, 10 Bukit Chermin Road (near Telok Blangah MRT). They're not explicitly halal, but they do cater to different dietary needs on request.

singapore,3bzap6,mminsy,2,Fri Jul 3 18:22:48 2015 UTC,"With your stats, that would be an almost 7-8% increase in bodyfat percentage. Next to none of it will be muscle, less than a half kilo and that's if you're lucky. Even if it was probable, no matter where you are in terms of fitness, and I can tell you, you're nowhere near morbidly underweight, you'd go from where you are now to the high side of average bf%/low to mid side of overweight bf%. Yes, it's hard to put on quality lean muscle mass, but I can tell you from experience, it's so much harder to cut down the fat."
singapore,3bzap6,thursday12th,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:28:04 2015 UTC,Happy with 15% tbh.  How much muscle mass can I gain in 2 months and what can I expect?
singapore,3bzap6,straydog1980,1 point,Sun Jul 5 10:39:01 2015 UTC,"You have 7% bodyfat, mostly untrained, at 69kgs and 5 foot 11? Not to be a hater, but you'd have to be an aspiring Mr. Olympia/training for years or on steroids.   In two months untrained you could gain around 2lbs of lean muscle mass if you're conservative with how much fat you want to gain (250 calorie surplus a day) or 3-4lbs if you're fine with stacking on a couple of pounds of fat (500 calorie surplus a day). Keep in mind for muscle growth to happen you want to be taking around 1g of protein for every pound you weigh (for you, that's 150g of protein a day), and you mostly want to be working with the 8-12 rep range per set (unless you're a complete beginner in which case what works for you is the perfect routine).  Above a 500 calorie surplus a day isn't recommended, because you'd be putting on more fat than what the muscle growth you'd put on is worth.  Sorry if I sound harsh or condescending, especially in the first paragraph. If you want more information, I highly suggest /r/fitness. It's an invaluable subreddit for advice, form checks and what not, and has a great FAQ for beginners/intermediate lifters.  /rant"

singapore,3by574,snowcroc,6,Fri Jul 3 06:37:48 2015 UTC,"The word ""Indian"" is a loaded one. India is more like a collection of people from very diverse backgrounds and you will find a lot of those groups here.  The predominant group in Singapore are the Tamils. This is a group formed when the state boundaries were redrawn linguistically. The state was called TamilNadu, literally Tamil Country.   However, you can go deeper than this. Most Tamils are Dravidians. As are most of the Kannadigas, Telugus, and Malayalis. And then you have the Aryans (Not the Hitler kind). Dravidians are generally South Indian and Aryans are generally North Indian, although is this a loose rule at best.  And then you have religion. Hinduism, Islam, Christianity,Sikhism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and various other folk religions exist and could be effectively classified as ethnic groups as they rarely intermarry.   In Hinduism and to some extent in the other religions you have the caste system and since inter caste marriages are still relatively rare. And then the castes have sub castes.  Then you have Anglo Indians, who are group formed out of inter marriages between the British and Indians during India's colonial days.  And then (this is getting a bit picky) you have the French and Portuguese Indian communities. The French are particularly numerous, so much so that French is an official language there. Although most tend to be ethnically Tamil.  And then you have Sri Lankans, technically not Indian, but many put it down as their official race.  I know you asked about Indians in SG, but it is not as simple as Hindu, muslim, tamil, malay. Many put their race as indian and take up tamil as their mother tounge due to convenience. You will find a bit of every type of Indian in SG.  Source: Am Indian, heard a lot of stories from parents."
singapore,3by574,astragal,5,Fri Jul 3 08:13:48 2015 UTC,Similar to the 'malay' community – a lot of cultural heritage is erased. Except I think (I am not malay so I don't really know) that due to the common language the cultures have become more integrated. I had a tutor in school who was very vehemently against the CMIO division and insisted that he is 'Javanese' not 'Malay'.

singapore,3by574,mott3h,3,Fri Jul 3 05:31:14 2015 UTC,"A friend who is Indian muslim that speaks Tamil once told me that sometimes when he went to mosque for friday prayers, they speak in Malay and he doesn't understand. I didn't ask whether that was due to geographical limitations [i.e. because it happens to be the nearest mosque to school/work], so my question is: is this common or are there (sufficient) Tamil language sessions in Singapore mosques? Or how does it work?  Also, at least in your view, how common is it for Indian muslims to identify as Malay (maybe they're mixed maybe not I don't know)? Related to that is, what is the extent to which Indian muslims speak Malay and don't speak or can't speak Tamil?"
singapore,3by574,KaseyRyback,3,Fri Jul 3 07:43:59 2015 UTC,"As far as I know (I'm not particularly religious btw), there are a handful of mosques where the sermons are addressed in Tamil.

These mosques are located around the Little India, Beach Road, Chinatown area where most of the Indian Muslim families once lived.  I don't identify myself as Malay. I've been in Singapore my whole life and I cannot speak an iota of.   I believe most of the Malay-speaking tamil families had interracial marriages of sorts when Tamil Muslim men married malay women. This led a concoction of languages being spoken within the household maybe predominantly the Malay language."

singapore,3by574,irlando,3,Fri Jul 3 12:04:12 2015 UTC,"Errr  small note. Islam is /= Malay and Indian Muslim /= indian marrying malays.  Islam is a well entrenched religion in India and many Indian Muslims are pure indians (from any region of india) who just happen to practice Islam as their religion. Most indian muslims will speak their native indian tongue, and (given that its singapore) they speak english and a smattering of malay and maybe even chinese dialects.  From what I know indian Muslims and malays do vary quite a bit in their practices so I don't necessarily think they'll identify themselves as malay."

singapore,3by574,dashrandom,9,Sat Jul 4 07:12:28 2015 UTC,"There are pretty much as many Indian subtypes as there are colours of the wind. There are different ethnic groups, subgroups and sub sub divides to make a man go batty.  A bit of background: India is subdivided into north and south India with the most different subtypes seen at the ends. North Indians tend to speak Hindi or related tongues and are typically fairer while South Indians tend to be darker and speak a hodgepodge of related tongues,  the root language being Tamil. (Historically north Indians are believed to be descendents of the influx of Aryan tribes while south Indians are from the native Dravidian stock).  In Singapore, historically the first Indians brought along by the colonising British were from south India, largely Tamilnadu. As a result the predominant language through our development was tamil, hence it's status as one of the 4 official languages in Singapore. (Contrast this to India where hindi is the lingua franca and tamil is often seen as inferior.. well at least by north indians)  With the march of time and Singapore's progress more and more migrants came over from all over India  to seek their fortune in our land.  When it came to schooling, many of the other indians, coming from regions  like Punjab, Maharastra or Kerala to name a few opted to take an entirely foreign language (malay) in school rather than learn a non native indian tongue.  Currently there are a whole buttload of different groups of indians in sg. The majority, second-third generation and so on largely tend to be Tamil and speak tamil.  Newer migrants can be from anywhere and will speak their own mother tongue in addition to malay, if there were schooled locally from the 70s-80s to the late 90s.  Source: off the top of my head. Dates and details may not be pinpoint accurate but I believe you get the gist."

You can identify it from the pipe that goes through the wall into your house.  Water meter is a little trickier.

singapore,3bug1d,singaporeguy,2,Thu Jul 2 07:52:00 2015 UTC,I thought so too. High beam is an 'offensive' signal.   Now what about the hazard light? Is it used here to say thanks?
singapore,3bug1d,a5ph,2,Thu Jul 2 15:15:22 2015 UTC,"Hazard light at the extremely left lane usually means the driver is slowing down and may come to a total stop. The vehicle behind should leave a distance and prepare to stop or change lane if he is impatient. Any other lanes usually mean the driver either left it on absent-mindedly (very common on lorries) or there is really something wrong with the vehicle.   To say thanks, the drivers in Singapore usually raise their left hand as though they are saying Hi without any waving motion. It is quite visible to the vehicle directly behind him and is appreciated."
singapore,3bug1d,singaporeguy,5,Fri Jul 3 01:53:07 2015 UTC,"I normally raise my left hand in the car to thank the person behind me for giving way or to apologise for a mistake I made.  I tried to follow the Japanese way of thanking people using a single flash of my hazard lights, but it doesn't really seem to work.  I do use my high-beams to indicate to people in lane 1 that they're hogging, or to warn cars exiting from sliproads/turning at junctions ."

On a serious and heavy-hearted note, I've come to the conclusion after 18 months of riding a motorcycle that riding like a retard is the best way to keep safe. Instead riding at the speed limit in the middle of the lane is the best way to invite tailgaters and people from the sides to cut in without warning.  When I'm more bold with lane-splitting and filtering, I find that drivers actually move to the sides of their lane to give space. Perhaps there's some psychological effect from having a light rapidly becoming bigger in their side mirrors.  It's extremely bewildering."
singapore,3bug1d,crimsonSoldier,2,Thu Jul 2 15:42:57 2015 UTC,"For example, if I want to tell the car in front on the adjacent lane that I'm giving way to him to enter my lane, do I flash my high beams?   Simplest way to do this is to widen the gap he's intending to enter till the gap is obviously wide and safe. If you're in motion, slow down gently to widen gap. If you're stationary, just stay still and let the car in front of you move ahead to create the gap.  Using high beams to get people's attention or convey a message is unnecessarily distracting. The horn is meant to be used to get attention, and only in serious situations.  Another thing I always do is raise my hand to thank people for letting me change lanes or wait for me when I have right of way."
singapore,3bug1d,Cataplexic,2,Thu Jul 2 10:47:00 2015 UTC,"As a rule, you should never flash your beams if you can help it, because it may dazzle the other driver, or they may perceive it as an aggression. Just slow down, and allow the person to merge in if they are indicating. If they don't take it within 20 seconds speed right back up to the speed limit and close the clearance you just gave them."

singapore,3bug1d,onique,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"I've observed this practice in my travels around Europe and even driving in Malaysia where leaving your right signal on in the overtaking lane of the expressway tells drivers in front of you to get out of your way, in a more polite manner as compared to flashing your high beams.   I do this all the time but close to no one here seems to understand (apart from a few of my driving kakis and some taxi drivers). Does anyone else do it?"
singapore,3bug1d,macabrebanana,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:43:40 2015 UTC,High beam Flipping the bird Left signal for left turn Right signal for right turn
singapore,3bug1d,bxnlxxng,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:06:12 2015 UTC,"this is what i do and it often works.  if the car is on my right lane and is signalling left, and i want to let them know that i am giving way, i signal right.   usually, the other car thinks that i want to go into his lane; and so will find it okay to move into my lane.   So, while my signalling right may not necessarily be conveying my ""giving way"", it does achieve the intended purpose. The other driver moves into my lane; and continues. I turn off my indicator and continue.  He/She may have noticed in the rear-view mirror that I had signalled right and then haven't moved into his lane. He/She may think that I am a stupid driver that can't make up my mind. But that is okay.  Am hoping more people will realize the original intent, and this will catch on."
singapore,3bug1d,telepath_2000,2,Sat Jul 4 12:58:44 2015 UTC,"Well this is ingenious. It works remarkably well too, because when I'm unsure if the driver is going to give way and he signals to enter my lane, it tells me that it's definitely okay to enter his lane."

No company takes good care of your career life without you holding any bargaining chip.

""It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a website, it's not ok to be a website with a reddit account."" -Confucius    Specific self-promotion rules differ across various subreddits but there are some guidelines that can be followed.  But really to keep it simple, I like to think of a subreddit as one big kopitiam - there are lots of conversations going around, with many familiar faces of regulars and new people alike. Would you like it if some guy you've never seen before in your life comes into this place and starts handing out his or her namecards or trying to hardsell you stuff when you're busy talking or listening into the conversations around you? You wouldn't like it, would you?  But what if it's the frequent regular you've known who hangs around the kopitiam being friendly to everyone and who's been chatting up a storm with the other folks and new faces. You know the guy, you've talked before - so wouldn't it be much more palatable if he one day then goes ""oh yeah, I did this cool thing a while back, wanna see?""

Although the name of the show plays on the word The News, the literal gallows humor of the program's name is unlikely to be missed by viewers in a country which executes people by hanging, and the use of ""neck-cuffs"". The third season began airing on June 1, 2010.   The fourth season began airing on March 8, 2011.  The fifth season began airing on December 27, 2011 and features topics such as the Mayan Calendar and doomsday and other relevant current issues. A sixth season began airing on April 2, 2013, aligned with the renumbering of MediaCorp news programmes.  Michelle Chong will not return to the cast for the sixth season.  A seventh season began airing on 1 April 2014 (April Fools' Day),  with Chong set to return to the show.

Add in the mixed vegetables last so they won't be mushy and salt/pepper for taste. Next, prepare an egg mixture with butter onto another pan and pour it in gently. Add the rice mixture before the egg fully cooks and wait a little bit. Then flip the egg and wrap it gently around the rice. Squirt a little more ketchup on the top.    With the rest of the money, buy some non-chilled carbonated drinks/non carbonated like coca cola for 75 cents and then go home and chill for a few hours. Also, a 1L bottle of green tea costs like $1.75. You can try that if you don't like carbonated drinks. Enjoy!"
singapore,3bryt2,SarahSeraphim,3,Thu Jul 2 06:13:02 2015 UTC,"Let's try something different since a lot of people are defaulting to western food. How about some home-cooked food, Mom-style?  Menu:   Stir-fried green leafy veggies - get a pack of green leafy at $1.90. Stir fry with salt and garlic (I assume garlic is available at home). Omelette with minced meat - Buy minced pork works out to around $1.70 for 100g. 3 eggs, soy sauce, minced pork, paprika, onion powder into a large bowl and mix well. Pan-fry. Ginger chicken - Acquire 2 chicken thighs at  $3.60. Debone and slice into chunks. Marinade in soy sauce, dark sauce and a bit of cornstarch. Get ginger at $2.20, slice it all up into stripes and fry in vegetable oil for a couple of minutes to release the flavours. Drop then marinated chicken in and continue to stir fry. Salt and pepper to taste. Steamed rice. You could also get a simple fried rice with salt, a bit of soy sauce, eggs and chili going. You could also throw in the bones of the chicken thighs for some extra flavour.   Total cost: $9.40. Better news? Online prices are generally more expensive.  I would spring a bit more for some stock to cook the rice in.  P/S: I assumed a standard Singaporean stocked kitchen, so I did not factor in the cost of the dark soy sauce and cornstarch.  I cooked this for my girlfriend. We're married now. 10/10 will try again. (Some might see this as 0/10, though.)"

Fry in that order. With generous amount of olive oil.  5) Remove from heat, toss pasta in the oil mixture.  6) Cut the chicken boobs into strips, fry using oil.  7) Remove and serve on the side with mushroom aglio olio  8) ????  9) Sexy times (oooohhh your ladle is soooo big)"

singapore,3bsybo,NXMT,8,Wed Jul 1 22:24:49 2015 UTC,I personally use Sheng Siong as they have very flexible timing and can usually deliver on a next day basis and even same day if you're early enough. There's also NTUC and RedMart. Always double check your goods.
singapore,3bsybo,random_avocado,2,Wed Jul 1 23:10:17 2015 UTC,Cold Storage too.
singapore,3bsybo,irlando,6,Wed Jul 1 23:46:47 2015 UTC,You'll most probably be living within walking distance or a short bus journey from a supermarket :)  I don't know anyone that uses grocery delivery so can't speak to how good it is
singapore,3bsybo,junnir,5,Thu Jul 2 00:49:02 2015 UTC,"My mom recently started using Fairprice's delivery service... I guess it's pretty alright, haven't heard any complaints or anything bad yet. Most of us here don't really use the delivery service though!"

singapore,3bsybo,LenerDee,4,Thu Jul 2 11:52:40 2015 UTC,"We mostly dont have grocery delivered to us (?). We get our grocery from the local supermarkets from the nearest shopping mall (NTUC, Cold Storage, Giant, Sheng Siong). Or you could try the wet market but you have to be up early to buy fish/vegetables from them. Most of the stall owners in the fish market are older citizens and might not be able to converse in english tho.  Or ... if you're living in a HDB flat here, there might be a convinience store at the void deck of your flat that sells groceries too."
singapore,3bsybo,Asyrol,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:47:15 2015 UTC,"Cool, I'd imagine for every day stuff that's good enough... I'm mostly concerned about heavy stuff. Do you normally do 1 weekly shop, or buy what you need every day? Or something in between?"

I was buying a case of beer for a house party and didn't want to lug it home from the nearest Fairprice.   They've got a pretty good selection of stuff, from chilled dairy to dry pantry items. They've recently expanded their options to fresh food (but still pretty limited). Service is pretty good, their delivery times are pretty easy to get, and you get discounts if you're okay adding 2 hours to the delivery window."

singapore,3bsybo,condor_gyros,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:21:23 2015 UTC,"Remember the basics, and you'll be fine. It's still a compact car, so the size difference isn't going to be too noticeable. If you don't feel confident, you can always take a couple lessons with the new car to get used to it. You'll find that the actual physical size of a car doesn't really matter as much as the sensitivity of the brakes, accelerator, transmission, weight distribution, blind spots, etc."

I was deployed as photographer for the parade in my camp.  Camp cameras were all moldy and malfunctioning (auto-focus function gone =_=), so I had to bring in my 7D like a boss with an LOA (letter of authorization) lol.   Thought it was going to be another boring parade to cover but boy was I wrong. It was the first time I got to see all my commanders lined up for the parade. There's this weird sense of feeling that you'd get when you see your commanders and all the big shots in sedia position... Maybe I suaku, sorry lah only 7 months in for NS.  Not to mention having to stand right in front of these big shots (including my CO) to take close-up of them... nerve-wrecking >.<  Later half of my day was spent going all the way to Singapore Prison Service at Changi to drop off a letter I wrote to a friend in jail. It was my first time doing this, let alone going there... and I must say the process looks painfully slow.  A notice there states that all letters would be screened and it would take 2 weeks for letters to reach their intended recipients. Boyfriend of the friend in jail came along to drop off his letter too, and said that we could've sent our letters by post to the prison service but that alone would've taken 2 weeks too, so that would make the entire process of having the letter reach the recipient 4 weeks... Mannn..."

Because the last I heard from him I came to know he was going through some problems in his relationship, a fleeting thought that maybe his boyfriend kidnapped him even crossed my mind lol.  I asked his boyfriend - he wouldn't tell me a thing except that something huge and bad happened, which didn't help making me stop imagine things lol. After some time (during which he asked my friend during a visit if it's okay for him to tell me the truth), he finally revealed the fact that my friend had been arrested three months ago. Was pretty shocked and disappointed lah.  Just glad that he's due for release sometime end of this year. :)"

singapore,3bsybo,coffeeandsex,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:28:53 2015 UTC,"More, reapply after 2 hours if sweating a lot.   From AAD:   How much sunscreen should I use, and how often should I apply it?   Use enough sunscreen to generously coat all skin that will be not be covered by clothing. Ask yourself, “Will my face, ears, arms, or hands be covered by clothing?” If not, apply sunscreen. Most people only apply 25-50% of the recommended amount of sunscreen.6 Follow the guideline of “one ounce, enough to fill a shot glass”, which dermatologists consider the amount needed to cover the exposed areas of the body. Adjust the amount of sunscreen applied depending on your body size. Apply the sunscreen to dry skin 15 minutes BEFORE going outdoors. Skin cancer also can form on the lips. To protect your lips, apply a lip balm or lipstick that contains sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. Re-apply sunscreen approximately every two hours or after swimming or sweating heavily according to the directions on the bottle."

singapore,3brav3,mminsy,8,Wed Jul 1 14:52:53 2015 UTC,"Food Science Student here.  You need to get the term Food Science right. Because many of my course mate got it wrong.  Here are some of the courses you can go to  Food Science and Technology = PRODUCTION of food. If you think you are studying food properties like those on TV or youtube you are dead wrong. Think of this as chemical engineering but the food version.   Food Science and Human Nutrition (this is offered by SIT) = Mainly studying the relationship between food and nutrition  Chemistry = The ultimate winner. Get a degree in Chem specializing on Food Science. Food chemistry more complex than you think because food is a natural product. It's not some gay ass sigma aldrich purity 99.999% chemicals. Basic chem: When you have very dirty ""reagents"" to start with. How much theory do you think you need to know to clean it up.  To me it feels like you are paper chasing and Unis don't take too kindly for this. If you some how con your way through you wouldn't last long in your course either (lack of real passion). If you are starting a business on food production go work in a food company and see their operations. Alternatively go to SIM-GE and take a degree on business management. When you start up your company get a specialist to set up the factory for you. There is a centre in Singapore Poly called FIRC and this firm helps create products from raw ingredients to ready to sell on the shelves products.   Also, Singapore production is shrinking quite badly. You may want to consider looking at our industry before stepping in.  Don't think that getting a degree would change anything. Execution does. You know this as a business student.  Because at the end of day:  How do you think the older generation bosses started making food in Singapore without a food science degree?   EDIT: I would like to start that I am the source of ""conflict of interest"". This is because I am jumping to business and OP is doing the opposite. This cert is itty gritty with the details. If you were to do a start up and run a business there's no way you can monitor your business and the fine technicalities of you day to day operation. Good networking and finding good food scientist is key to a successful food business.  Also OP go see where the majority of NUS food science graduates end up. If you see something wrong (discrepancy) then just bail out."
singapore,3brav3,Soldierducky,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:57:38 2015 UTC,"Good point about the older generation way of starting a biz without a paper. Yeah, currently hunting for internships to be damn sure of this whole thing. Although where should I be directing my efforts to - MNCs or SMEs. I keep getting varying opinions, from MNCs because ""it looks good on your resume"", ""they have resources to train you"", or SMEs ""because they need more people who can serve variety of roles"". Plus I have zilch knowledge so it's a lil hard to justify other than ""I can help you with business related and design related aspects such as creating marketing collaterals from scratch"".   Although my POV about furthering studies in biz... I feel the best way to learn is just to have your own. What I've been doing in biz was analyse existing ones or writing biz plans. To me, the learning curve isn't that steep and can be learned on my own w/o guidance from a tutor or prof. And the key point - what you write on a biz plan will not always go accordingly during execution"
singapore,3brav3,Soldierducky,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:37:37 2015 UTC,"If you are determined in food science. Choose a uni first. I interned in AVA and my upper management is like all from over seas.

It's a good way to know what the course is about."
singapore,3brav3,Soldierducky,0,Thu Jul 2 11:19:21 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that way as well. But I also realize why you need a proper proper business education  1) microeconomics  2)supply chain management   3) analytics  4) game theory or optimization   5) HR  6)much more  Go to you poly's business library and browse through the amount of knowledge it provides.   I agree that you can study business yourself (heh heh I torrented multitudes of business books) but it's way better to have a lecturer giving you a proper foundation. I suggest SMU. Schools gives you education in a professional manner. Doing it alone requires needless ""guess and check"". I'm not saying that studying makes you automatically better. But at the very least, it's efficient as it gets into your head fast.   I want you to enter Uni in a new perspective by saying: What do I want to know? What do I need to know? And what must I know to gain an unfair advantage over other poly biz peeps. You achieve this by selecting your modules.   Remember don't enter an Uni to chase paper. When doing that you are not optimizing your education. You are suppose to leverage on it.   One example would be me. I intend to enter banking because I find investing interesting and easy. I want to gain new information that is organized, precise and useful. Hence I intend to enter uni to learn the language on how the ""big 4"" does and operate. I intend to do valuation and financial modeling as my modules. Seeing that quantitative work is new trend. I am self teaching programming language (I truly wish I have a teacher through). You see, this is what I mean by knowing what you want and leveraging on your education.   You do know you can select your own modules right?"

(Probably why I don't want a business degree either because I don't intend to have an office job)  Although the people I've spoken to (NUS) said that the teaching style & culture is about the same as how it has been going all the while in poly. They said the best experience for them and where they learnt the most was going overseas on exchange programmes and working for an overseas startup there. And then they came back, graduated and are running their own startup.   Thanks for the list of recommended unis btw! Will check them out. Wa but none recommended from US..? My planned course of action is as follows: find a company to intern with, study, develop my own food product (not on a large scale though.. I want to develop something healthy. Although my dream is large-scale production of a healthy food FMCG... im sick of large corporations marketing food as healthy when it is not), set up a startup and sell (of cos before that need an NEA cert and what not), and try stuff like argiculture/farming too.

singapore,3brav3,Wheat-gen-stein,5,Fri Jul 3 07:50:28 2015 UTC,"Food sciences & technology is much more viable and diverse outside Singapore.  Several universities in States, UK, Australia have strong faculties in that industry. Just do your research and you'll come across them.  Also look at major FST partnerships with companies to get a feel of what you're eventually heading into.  Apply directly yourself as that is the best way to dig into the application details. You get a direct line to the admissions office through emails. Google about how to draft emails to admissions offices. There are websites and forums that provide tips on how to phrase your queries. If you go through an agent, what does that say about your desire and self-motivation?  Do not worry about switches. Overseas universities are less anal about you coming from a different field of study. A different background such as yours in business will stand you in good stead for private sector companies after you graduate.  The culture and mindset of foreign universities is markedly different from local universities. You may hold certain assumptions about how what works for local universities is likewise with overseas universities so always question your own mental models as you do your research.  Reach out to FST professionals in Singapore for their thoughts (e.g. via LinkedIn) and phrase your initial message to them well. Also reach out to the current FST departments in local universities by asking for informational interviews (say 20 mins of their time) - some profs or grad students might be willing to spare their time for you.  Lastly, people will convince you that local options are more advisable. That is true to a certain extent, but do your due diligence and you'll realize that it is far better to study overseas. Get a job away from Singapore - see the world, experience different working cultures, learn from professionals with diverse backgrounds. You'll see the world differently thereafter. And later on, you can make a decision whether you want to come back to Singapore to work. With the overseas experience, you are much more ""valuable"" if you wish to look at it that way."
singapore,3brav3,Thorberry,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:49:50 2015 UTC,"Overseas universities are less anal about you coming from a different field of study. A different background such as yours in business will stand you in good stead for private sector companies after you graduate.   Its not about what field of study one comes from. Rather its whether OP has the basic background knowledge to pursue the course. If a person has never taken math before, how would he survive in an engineering or applied physics course? Local universities take students from different fields all the time. Engine/Science poly grads end up in business, humanities and arts all the time. But the reverse is not that simple.   The ""hard/natural sciences"" are not something one can easily pick up. The curriculum is usually too deep and they start off at a level whereby you need to have some science and math knowledge. Whereas anyone can pick up a soft science in university because the only pre-requisite you need to have is the ability to write on paper."
singapore,3brav3,invenue,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:07:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's my POV as well... Although I took triple science in O Levels and had As for Biology and Chemistry. Does that even count for uni applications or do I need something similar as  an A Level cert.  Either way it means whatever country I go, prep school would be a must and that's 1 year of extra education to factor in?"
singapore,3brav3,Wheat-gen-stein,2,Thu Jul 2 04:28:02 2015 UTC,"Most US universities have little pre-university requirements because their cohorts comes from everywhere, so it's very possible to do a science or engineering degree with minimal math and science training. It should still be possible to finish in four years, which is the standard length in the US. Some US universities are known to welcome quite a few poly grads (Purdue, I think), but it's up to you to research and find these schools.  You don't need an agent and you shouldn't use one. But remember that US universities tend to be pretty expensive compared to local ones."
singapore,3brav3,invenue,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:30:07 2015 UTC,"This is very true in Singapore where rigour and evidence of pre-requisite knowledge is highly emphasized as part of admissions policy.  However, it is not as rigid in overseas universities due to the diversity of students and their variances in educational background and qualifications - which admissions policy has to take into account. For the sake of argument, it is a matter of degree (pun intended) whether the ""arts"" student has SAT-level maths, GCE-level maths, or IB-level maths.  I do agree to a certain extent with what you expressed and further reiterate my earlier point that ""what works in Singapore may not be the same for what works elsewhere"".  Hence I was encouraging OP to be mindful of our general assumptions and mental models, so that he will read the applications requirements as objectively as possible.  Post-script:  ""The ""hard/natural sciences"" are not something one can pick up easily.""  I would like to point out that this is an example of a mental model I was referring to.  We could modify the statement above to  ""The ""hard/natural philosophies"" are not something one can pick up easily.""  The premise would change and the mental model remains the same.  Simply because STEM has been the focus of Singapore's education system, people believe that STEM is harder to master than arts/humanities. This is not true. Try speaking with Philosophy undergrads in NUS to get an understanding of the immense depth and landscape of its study which is as varied and diverse as STEM subjects. And a subject as 'innocuous' sounding as ""Ethics of Genetics"" turns out to be as complex as STEM research.  My point is that when we have been enculturated societally in one discipline (STEM), we tend to view things with certain mental models which result in bias. Whether we are aware of that bias in our decision-making (such as OP's journey), is another matter altogether."
singapore,3brav3,feladirr,2,Thu Jul 2 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"No no. I think you've misunderstood me.   The hard sciences are easy to pick up. Just as easy as humanities. But only if you have the right tools. Both humanities and STEM courses are equally challenging at the university level too. However, STEM courses start off at a level whereby they need you to have certain background knowledge.   Im a philosophy student too, but not at NUS. Nice to meet you. And yes, philosophy is very complex. However, we don't need many pre-requisites because all you need to start learning is the ability to read.  However, for you to start learning engineering, you need more than just the ability to read. You'd need multivariate calculus, integration, complex numbers to get going. You need these certain tools. This is where it gets difficult IF you do not possess these tools.  Im not saying that hard sciences are harder to learn than soft sciences. Im saying that the former needs certain tools and knowledge before starting off at the university level. Whereas the latter needs little to no background knowledge."

I believe UCAS allows you to apply for deferred admission up to one year ahead. Agents aren't needed, or even advisable, for UK universities. Just make sure you write a very, very good personal statement, and find one of the tutors you're closest to in poly to agree to put their name to a reference (which ideally you should draft yourself as well).  If you're planning to apply to Australian universities, wait for an education fair organised by IDP. You'll get your application fees waived if you apply there. (I should add that I received offers from Australian universities for this unrelated non-science discipline too — one of them even offered me a partial scholarship.)

singapore,3brav3,invenue,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:58:36 2015 UTC,"The course sequence you show sounds like a community college in California, am i right ? Math 17 or Math 21 would be the course number and the grades required for each course (All course codes in all Cali CCs are the same).  What's your highest qualification ?  If you are entering with O levels - you'll have to sit for a community college entrance test. You do not need to take SAT. The entrance test will dictate which courses you can start with. It only test you on English and Math at a secondary level.   Grades in CCs are normally A/B/C. Some offer A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-. The GPA for all your course work is over 4.0. An A gets you a 4, B gets you a 3 and C gets you a 2. If you are looking to transfer into a competitive University, you'll normally need a 3.5 GPA and above. This more so if you intend to go to a UC (University of Cali).  A general way to give you the best chance of entering a UC is to join their TAP program. It's a transfer agreement program tied with any Cali CC. So long as you've completed X number of credit hours in a CC, and you've met the GPA requirements, you will get into the UC of your choice. UCSD, UCLA and UC Berkeley do not have this agreement. You'll have to transfer like a normal student.  A general course sequence for yourself would look something like this.  Year 1 Fall  Eng Comp I College Algebra General ED sequence Major Elective Major Elective  Year 1 Spring  Eng Comp II Pre Calculus General Ed sequence Major Elective Major Elective   That's 30 credits, then you start your application for the TAP program to enter a UC. Continue with your Year 2 Fall sem, and finish up your last 30 credits and transfer."

They'd apply for your admission to the school and accommodation too, all according to the details and preferences that you have given to them.

Chinese Singaporeans seem to be more frank regardless of class. The most extreme and unrepentant racism i've ever heard has come from Chinese Singaporeans who were borne into wealth... and i'm from rural white Australia  2) same again with your homophobia, Chinese Singaporeans seem to have a don't ask don't tell (even though you really know) kind of thing going on. 3) your authoritarianism - Chinese Singaporeans don't pretend not to be authoritarian.  I must explicitly say: I don't think Aussies are any better or practically much different on any of these fronts, it's just a weird way of dealing with these social tensions (which in both cases always work out in favour of the status quo) from our perspective."

While Greeks have stopped puting coins on the eyes of death bodies, Scandanavians have stopped burning bodies with viking ships, Egyptians have stopped mummifieding bodies, the Chinese have continued with ancenster worship. Think of it as a ""living fossil"" for culture if you will.  Sometimes when I play historical strategic games, I would think won't it be awesome if the ancient greeks, romans, vikings, presians, egyptians, Incans, Huns are still with us?

The barometer is the Hungry Ghosts Month, which hasn't been accepted in the mainstream yet despite China opening up.   makes sense. Anecdotally speaking, it all varies. Religion in mainland China is interesting, e.g. a lot of the 我信耶稣 (Christians) types can be very strict about it. Whereas (anecdotally) most people would just consider themselves non-religious, even if they do the occasional/yearly 求平安 (pray for good fortune/blessings/peace w/e) kind of things at the temples (Buddhist or otherwise).  As for the hungry ghost festival, imo it's reasonable to use the old cliche about Taiwan/HK adhering to tradition.  So I'd say you're prob right on that point; but I think there's still quite a lot of people who would continue such practices, especially in the south [again anecdotal]. As to whether the majority (i.e. >50%) of them do it I don't know. i.e. I don't know if its mainstream."

Seriously, before you respect your long dead ancestors   Your tacit dismissal of ancient Chinese practices when trying to persuade others does not help. Filial piety is considered a virtue in Chinese culture, and is probably the most important one. Ancestor worship is one of the obligations under filial piety.   why don't you respect your still living neighbours first by not giving them lung cancer?    I don't know what the extent of the smoke is, and I think one day the Chinese will have to find a way to overcome the negative impacts from burning or find an alternative. In any case, I too dislike smoke [then again, to dislike is not enough, it has to harmful which it probably is, so as to distinguish it from say cooking smoke (which is probably bad as well but not really intentional)]  I think if it affects your neighbours, better not do it; but you'll need a courageous gahmen to ban burning practices say, at the ground floor.  Back to your point however, my guess is that a bargain/compromise was struck between the Chinese and the gahmen when people were made to live in flats."

And what of Hong Kong and Taiwan?  And are you seriously comparing a tiny city-state where people live cheek by jowl in flats to a large country of 1.3billion people. People don't have a fucken village here.  I mean I'm open to the idea that people should be considerate to their neighbours but lol just cause people think the whole idea is silly is not sufficient cause to prevent others from practising their beliefs.  Besides, I'm not sure which part of China you're from. For example, I can assure you that in Taiwan, during 中元节 (hungry ghost festival), people do make offerings in front their homes or offices or shops.  In other words, your argument that 'but people do it differently elsewhere' is weak. The original argument about harming neighbours is more relevant. I wouldn't be surprised things change in the future, many young people don't give a shit about these customs anymore. When there's sufficient acceptance, it'll just die down or gahmen will legislate.   Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like? (Your sentence is incomprehensible)    I've edited the grammar, ""it dislike"" should have read ""to dislike"".  Read it again, if you don't understand it it's ok, it's not crucial.

It's not wrong if there's a valid reason for it eg. having to communicate with customers in China.   Yet almost half of the classifieds require Chinese-speaking.   I have no idea where you got this statistic from or if it's accurate. I looked through the first 20 listings on http://www.stjobs.sg/singapore-jobs and only 4 of them require Mandarin. And even that doesn't necessarily reflect the general job situation in Singapore since not all job openings will be advertised on classifieds. It simply says that some firms have to  advertise for Mandarin speakers, maybe because it's difficult to find workers that are proficient in Mandarin.   There seems to be a disconnect here if you say that retail workers need to speak Chinese but yet say Singaporeans are English speaking.   Again, it depends. If a substantial proportion of the shop's clientele comprises of monolingual Mandarin speakers eg. the older generation, Chinese tourists, then it's not unreasonable to  have a Mandarin-speaking requirement, especially if you already have enough English-speaking staff."

I'll repost my entire reply to a comment about a similar issue from another thread verbatim:   well... it of course depends on the company, industry, market, job.  Anecdotally speaking from places I've worked at if there's an employee conversant in the native tongue of the customer, they'll use it [commonly Chinese [i.e. encompassing Min, Yue etc], Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Hindi, Tamil]. Notwithstanding the usage of English as the global standard (well mostly) for commerce, using their language when communicating verbally makes things a lot easier very often. Not to mention the other often mentioned benefits associated with being able to 'speak their language'.  Anecdotally again, Chinese nationals are one of the main groups this method is useful. Sure their manager may be able to speak English, but he/she ain't always got time for you. China isn't the only place but as pragmatic Singaporeans we're going to make use of whatever historical advantage we have [it so many Singaporeans are of Chinese descent]. Of course it's also open to the gahmen to eliminate race and language distinctions and make everyone the same through social engineering; but that is beyond the scope of my reply.  I mean, to what extent really, did you think that SMRT's attempt Mandarin train announcements were targeted at Singaporeans?  I also noticed that while Changi airport had directional signs in Japanese (and no Tamil) no one cried about it, or at least not loud enough.  People want to make money off other people with money; most people with money can English well enough, but it's not the case for the rest. Chinese people have money, but a significant portion of them don't do the English.  I mean it's open for everyone else to leverage their language and cultural skills. I'm sure every community does so.  They could do a study, but I think even accounting for what I've said, most jobs predominantly use English for all purposes.  TL;DR all I can say is businesses adapt, even in Western countries, where there's Chinese money involved they'll seek to find ways to have Chinese speaking people on their team.   If i were a job seeker that can't Chinese (at all) I'd probably still apply. I mean the reality is in Singapore one can get by without Chinese. So if the employer is being a dick about it, probably not too great a workplace anyway."

It is not uncommmon for a company to want to build a certain type of working environment. They could have elderly chinese people working that could only speak mandarin, or foreign nationals that could only speak a certain language.  It is totally up to a company's discretion what type of employees or events they want to partake in. The same goes for the employees, it is completely up to their own discretion what type of company they want to join.  Note: I am not suggesting that discrimination doesn't exist in Singapore, but it certainly does not point to that in this scenario."

Chinese privileges is a cancer.
singapore,3bp5ql,mwolfee,-12,Wed Jul 1 03:32:47 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with race. It was already made clear in the article that she was rejected base on the fact that she couldn't eat pork. If a company wants to have events where every member could attend without having to specially cater for special individuals, it is completely up to their discretion. That is the sort of environment they preferred, who are you to suggest otherwise?  If we switch this scenario with vegetarians, would that still be racist?"

I guess you know something that they don't.  If things like this are allowed, people will start hiring employees based on the most ridiculous criteria. I can start a company and say I'll only hire people who can swim because I will arrange swimming pool BBQ parties for my employees and I'm uncomfortable with non-swimmers, even though it has nothing to do with their job performance.  Worse still, a new vegan CEO takes over and fires all non-vegans, because it's 'inconvenient'.  Do you see how absurd these scenarios are? If Pork consumption has no relation to job performance, then this is discrimination. You can easily get a halal set meal, it's neither inaccessible nor expensive, it is simply used as a tool for discrimination against a person of a certain faith over an entirely arbitrary matter. You're too naive if you don't see that. I mean c'mon, keep it real."

Then that company is sure to fail yes. I have not in any way defended their company policies or actions, I merely stated the fact that they are free to hire whoever they want, heck they could even send out applications for people with 3 arms.

Even if what you assume is true, there is nothing the law or anyone can do about it. Anyone is free to start up a business and hire whoever they want.

singapore,3bqs57,dashrandom,30,Wed Jul 1 12:37:01 2015 UTC,"I share the view above, but I am completely against the Yulin Dog Meat festival for a few reasons:   The animals are intentionally killed extremely cruelly. There are pictures circulating of puppies thrown into boiling water live and their skin peeling off. This is because of the irrational belief that the adrenaline that the animals will produce close to death will make their meat more 'tasty'. I cannot condone this. If I want to eat meat, I hope the animals are killed as humanely as possible. The Yulin Dog Meat festival is not tradition at all. It was started in 2009 by the dog meat industry (does that sound like 10 years according to the misinformed kid writing in?). It brings millions of tourist dollars into the Yulin territory, of course they aren't going to want it shut down. Some of the dogs are kidnapped household pets. That's fucking terrible, not only is it stealing and disrespecting someone's pet, it's killing and consuming an animal knowing full well that it belongs to someone else as a pet. Some people have dogs for pets, some people have pigs or chickens for pets, but I'm pretty sure they all feel the same way about them."
singapore,3bqs57,dtwn,2,Wed Jul 1 14:23:51 2015 UTC,I find point 1 particularly interesting as hunters generally try to avoid startling the animal as the meat is more tender than an animal that has gotten its fight or flight reflex running.
singapore,3bqs57,Nikuhiru,21,Thu Jul 2 02:55:02 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. The problem with the festival isn't about the cuteness of the animals. I love dogs but if they're being raised on dog farms for the purpose of being eaten, that's fine.  The festival glorifies torturing the animals and in many cases dogs are stolen from family homes or rural farms. Skinning them alive or boiling them alive is horrible. All in the name of 'improving flavour'. Raise the dogs and kill them humanely."

The Pekingnese is a dog bred as a pet, it serves no functional purpose. In contrast almost all Western dogs breeds have a functional value. That includes poodles, spaniels, terriers.  Even most Western breeds classified under toy group have a purpose.    There are two groups in China that find eating dogs distasteful, and they have nothing to do with the West. The first are Manchus, and the Manchus banned eating of dogs when they ruled China.  That is why eating dog is rare in Northern China, because of the strong Manchu influence.

singapore,3bqutf,guoshe,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:04:43 2015 UTC,"With that budget, you can only get a room (100% sure), which means you need to share the house/apartment with others.   To get a room in two weeks is possible as long as you have a valid student pass.  If you are renting a room from a property agent, you are likely to be charged a half month rental as the agent fee (which is 400 for your case). Some of them will not charge you, you should always ask before hand.  Bear in mind that one month deposit is required for most of the cases."
singapore,3bqutf,redrobot01,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:10:35 2015 UTC,A room in a condo will set you back around $1300 so $800 is going to be tough or you'll be living in the fringes of the city.
singapore,3bqutf,tonyp7,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:42:35 2015 UTC,Is this some sort of exchange program with NTU? You could approach the school and see if you can stay in one of their hostels.
singapore,3bqutf,x4nth3r,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:53:22 2015 UTC,"For that budget, you can get a common room. Places that are closer to train stations or are in prime areas will be a lot pricey for obvious reasons (location, amenities, etc).   If you have a nice real estate salesperson to help, they could nego a master bedroom (because you get your own bathroom!) for about $750-$850. But do check if this includes the utility bills or if that's a separate cost. Also, not all rooms will have Internet connection or air-conditioning. Some common rooms are also called common because you might be sharing it (and the toilet) with another tenant.   As you're a student and I know budget is tight, you can try getting a place without an agent (because of the agent fee, which is roughly half of the rental you are paying). But be prepared that you will need to pay a security deposit (1 month rental) plus the upfront month's rental (so if you found a place that rents at $700, be prepared to fork out $1,400.00). At the end of your lease, the deposit will be returned back to you.. It's held just in case there's any damages in the apartment when the landlord checks, they'll offset the cost from the deposit to get it fixed.   Unfortunately private apartments at that price is a dream come true... In dreamland. You can consider renting at a hostel or student dorm (since you are a student). Just note that if you're renting out a room or place, the minimum lease is 6 months.   Last I check, there ought to be a couple of rooms avail in the Jurong West area (which is nearby to NTU). Rooms are usually a lot easier to secure than a complete apartment.   Check out 99.co or www.propertyguru.com.sg as well for room listings :) you can drop me a private message if you've got any questions and I'll try my best to help.   Good luck!"

singapore,3bomj0,squeeish,7,Wed Jul 1 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"Rule of thumb, make sure the vehicle stops before you cross the road.  Right of way don't matter when you're injured."
singapore,3bomj0,erisestarrs,3,Wed Jul 1 11:56:39 2015 UTC,Yeah this. Pedestrians have right of way but it's also the pedestrian's responsibility to check and make sure the vehicle is stopping or has stopped before you cross.

Regardless, here are a couple of tips:  1) Build a kickass portfolio showing versatility in your writing.  2) Don't bother with freelancer and fiverr. Competition is way too high.   It's definitely possible to do copywriting in SG- you could even say, it's because being good in English is a rare skill in SG that copywriters are even more in demand. Good luck!"

singapore,3bomj0,mrdoriangrey,3,Thu Jul 2 09:52:28 2015 UTC,Start by doing stuff on elance? Then you'll be able to build up a portfolio and then you can apply to agencies for work. That's how most of my friends do it. Portfolio is the key.
singapore,3bomj0,frallaporg,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:06:26 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. Can I do spec ads? I've read online that some people do that first to build their portfolios. Also if I do spec ads is it acceptable to leave the stock photo watermark?
singapore,3bomj0,mwolfee,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:07:50 2015 UTC,"Yup, spec ads are fine and watermarks are okay too. Obviously it'll be best if you can do some freelancing online to really show you've got what it takes. That will help a lot more.

Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said recently that Singapore does not have natural resources, not even a waterfall to generate hydroelectricity (""Safety net? More like a trampoline: DPM Tharman""; May 20).  We do have a man-made waterfall at the Jurong Bird Park, and there is hope that we can do more.  We have the technology to build 150m-deep lift wells to reach the caverns underground for gas storage.  Soon, it will be underground reservoirs.  The Government should conduct feasibility studies to build 150m-deep shafts and install magnetic-frictionless electric turbines at 30m intervals in each shaft, for the fast-flowing water to cascade down by gravity to spin the turbines.  There should be surplus electricity from the turbines in each 150m shaft to pump the water at the bottom of the shaft up to the surface and have perpetual fast-flowing water to generate electricity non-stop in all the shafts.  Singapore should set the pace to use this man-made new source of hydroelectric generation to reduce pollution caused by traditional sources of energy like oil and coal.  Tan Kok Tim   Someone give the man the nobel prizes in everything.  Edit: for emphasis on groundbreaking theoretical physics and revolutionary technology application"

But based on what you quoted ""convert energy from water flowing into underground caverns to electrical energy. This can be used to pump the water back to the surface.""....technically it's not unreasonable unless he's claiming 100% energy efficiency.  In theory, PART of the kinetic energy of the water could be converted to electrical energy as it flows downwards, however it's likely to be abysmal compared to the energy required to pump it back to the surface again, due to losses to friction with tunnel walls/turbines, turbulence and losses in conversion, transmission and storage.  But well....the idea of underground water storage caverns seems to be storing a bigger buffer of water anyway, not producing energy. That will be more important as we adapt towards a warming earth.

singapore,3bq5ow,tongrhj,3,Wed Jul 1 06:39:21 2015 UTC,"Since I drive for both apps, shout out for Grab too, they offer a few discounts for gss sale and throw in random discounts continuously.   Both apps have pros and cons for riders. With uber, drivers have no idea where you are going and will have no option to reject short trippers. Their minimum fare is lower too and is therefore better if you are taking short trips provided that the surge pricing is not in place when you book. During peak hours though, surge pricing can make a short trip from Asia square to mbs as expensive as twenty six dollars.   Grab car on the other hand does not use a meter, thus the fare is always fixed no matter if there is a heavy traffic jam, Driver took a longer route or Driver got lost. Therefore it makes sense to use Grab during peak hour where jams are frequent.   Advise here is to download both apps and get the most out of their promos, and trade referral codes with your friends. After which, use the fare estimate function to compare prices against Grab and see which gives you a better deal. Driver pool should be largely the same."

singapore,3bq5ow,Varantain,3,Wed Jul 1 09:16:44 2015 UTC,"I can only speak of my opinion as I've not spoken to other Grab drivers about it.   Usually during weekends, I'll get about one booking every five to ten minutes. During the Grab love weekend, the backlog and demand was so high that the minute I went online, bookings flooded in I can't even access my main app page to check my prior transactions.   During the promo, I think Grab was aiming not just to attract more users, but also to reward the drivers. Let's say your fare is only eight dollars, Grab will still pay the drivers a total of $15, while only deducting commission based on the $8 fare. In addition, Grab already have an awesome incentive scheme where you get rewarded handsomely for taking X number of trips per week.   Economics 101 : people respond to incentives. The above will mean that drivers will want to take as many short trips as they can, provided that the passenger pick up point is close to them. With such a crazy demand, they can simply sit back and cherry pick for their customers, taking only a few minutes to get that perfect trip maximizing their income.   Although Grab did foresee that demand will be crazy and did post a disclaimer that not everyone might get a ride, many oof my passengers were upset that that they had to try for hours to get a ride. I'm too polite to tell them that freebies are like this, and they should have taken a cab or bus if they wanted a fast ride.   All the above are just based on my own opinion and thoughts , please do not sue me. I love working with Grab and my opinion could be biased towards Grab.   Edited auto correct"

They struck me as genuinely interested in improving the commuting experience for both passengers and drivers. It's that sincerity and dedication that won me over. Of course, the incentives they give for now plays a major factor, I can't deny it. Ultimately, it's good that there is fierce competition among these companies, will only benefit us, both drivers and riders."

singapore,3blwgz,Juicycrumpets,8,Tue Jun 30 11:25:14 2015 UTC,"The problem is whether there was truly an equal opportunity for ""the public"" to attend the bbq, rather than whether an individual got his share of food or not. I think it’s worrying that we dismiss the issue as trivial just because it is about food. No matter how trivial the subject matter, inequality of opportunity is always going to be aggrieving. Alternatively, we can go full-on TRS and blame it on the foreigners."

singapore,3blwgz,TRex_Eggs,3,Tue Jun 30 16:32:36 2015 UTC,I like how people keep talking about how cheap Singaporeans are. I know foreigners who went down for the event and were pissed off as well. You really think people from other countries do not like free stuff?

singapore,3blwgz,onionguy4,6,Tue Jun 30 12:23:55 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the ticketing system wasn't announced beforehand. Apparently only PA people knew of the plan, and it was announced to the public on the PA website on the morning of the event?  Also, inconsistent handling of the ticketing policy."

singapore,3blwgz,condor_gyros,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:27:12 2015 UTC,I think it's a purely technical definition. PA is technically a nonpartisan grassroots organization but the overlap of leaders with government roles makes it pro-PAP. Just look at the board members.  Similarly the civil service is supposed to be nonpartisan. The ministers and respective ministries are supposed to serve the people with no political bias. How many people in Singapore conflate civil service with government and the PAP?

singapore,3blwgz,ceddya,-4,Tue Jun 30 09:14:03 2015 UTC,"What the actual fuck?! Singapore has over 5 million people and they only had 10k steaks. Did anyone really expect that everyone would get a piece? I read in one shitty article that some guy had planned to have a 'Aussie BBQ Dinner' with his friend at the event and couldn't get in and got upset. Firstly, if you're really gonna make a plan with a friend to a free event which common sense dictates will be crowded as fuck, why don't you find out more!? Why would you plan your schedule around something so tentative?  It's not like people are starving or anything, and I would've loved it if this was specifically for underprivileged families or for families at rental flats and stuff. But no, everyone needs a free steak."
singapore,3blwgz,trashmaker,10,Tue Jun 30 11:36:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think missing out on free food is the major issue here. Instead, people seem unhappy with how the ticketing was handled.   The ticket requirement was only announced last minute, and there weren't any instructions on how to obtain one. The lack of transparency is the bigger issue for those unhappy with how this was handled, and it does seem like a rather reasonable complaint."
singapore,3blwgz,ceddya,-4,Tue Jun 30 14:23:52 2015 UTC,"In an ideal world, you would collect all the names of interested participants, and then do a balloting and then issue tickets. But for an event like this which is free and just meant as a minor celebration, that level of detail is clearly unnecessary. While the ticketing may have been last minute, the outcome in the end would have been the same as only a small % of people would end up with the free steaks. It's not like having slightly better organization would've allowed more people to get a steak."
singapore,3blwgz,onionguy4,6,Tue Jun 30 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"It doesn't excuse the fact that the ticketing was handled really poorly. If you initially advertise the event as open to everyone, then change it at the last minute to require a ticket for entry without informing people on how to obtain a ticket, it really shouldn't come as a surprise  that there are people unhappy about it."

singapore,3bmjb4,captmomo,13,Tue Jun 30 12:43:32 2015 UTC,I went from Hospitality to Marketing. I had enough of frontline operations and decided to go for it when my friend told me an advertising agency was hiring.   Don't get me wrong though - it wasn't like a golden ticket out of the blue like some well-planned movie plot. I had to go through a lot of rejection before opportunity struck and I gambled to take it.  Some caveats -  1) You gotta be prepared to deal with doubtful HR personnel who will definitely ask why you're changing industries. They will probe about every single thing from your degree to why you're changing jobs and you might end up questioning yourself on whether it's really the right choice to make. It's nothing personal.   2) You also may have to be prepared to take a pay cut. People who usually take in industry jumpers will tell you that you gotta start from the bottom. (Most common reason is cos of the lack of relevant experience)  3) Then you will also have to deal with the fact that the learning curve will be steep because you're behind everyone to begin with and it's all catch up from the start.  But if you're sincere and work hard to prove your mettle it'll either pay off or tell you you're not cut out for it.   Good luck!

singapore,3bmjb4,psistarpsi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:48:11 2015 UTC,"For me it was worth the switch because I really didn't see myself still doing Front Office in hospitality. To be very frank, hospitality is really about soft skills; I didn't learn anything worthwhile in terms of strategies or communication tactics that I can utilise across various industries as compared to my current career, where I'm specialising in Digital Marketing and I've gained enough experience to advise my clients. The journey was not easy but I'm definitely certain that I'm in a happier place now despite the tough start.   YMMV though. As I've stressed on previously, it really is a 50-50 gamble when you make the jump."

I just went over to NUS today and they said that they dont accept poly students with an 'unrelated' poly diploma (well, should have thought about that before I went to poly). another issue is internships - i lack education in this field so do i self-educate before i apply or what?  appreciate any insight & info!"
singapore,3bmjb4,mminsy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"1) No experience whatsoever. I had to start from scratch but thankfully I had very good mentors  2) For life sciences or anything bio-related unfortunately in Singapore they're very ""see paper"" which means they'll really only favour you if you have a) a relevant diploma and b) a relatively high GPA (local uni accepts 3.xx and above). HOWEVER not all is lost. Some entities (such as hospitals and government-owned labs) offer scholarships to sponsor your studies as they're facing a deficit in manpower in this field. Downside is there may be a 3-4 year bond to it. So what I suggest is that you try getting a diploma and then apply for a scholarship midway. It's a lengthy journey (years wise) but if you're sure about it why not?   Source: I used to study life sciences in Poly (yez I am a master in changing stuff up at various stages in life)"

I majored in communications and I wanted out of the media industry, be it journalism, pr or corp comms etc.  It was REALLY difficult because as someone stated already, interviewers were really skeptical as to why I wanted to do something unrelated to my degree and previous job exp. I also felt they didn't buy it when I was trying to sell myself based on 'soft', 'transferable' skills.   And those were for the interviews I actually got called down for. More than 3/4 of the applications I sent out, including those for jobs I really wanted, were to no avail."

But we also can't really blame HR for being skeptical...imagine having to interview 5, 10 people saying the same thing but just quitting after a while. Gotta be annoying!

Most recent interviewer asked me why the switch and why the 'colourful' resume.   Told the truth that I was trying to find myself and what suited me best. I wasn't bad at what I did, but I was t happy in a number of places I worked. So far, teaching has made me the happiest, even with the pay cut (which you will have to ask yourself if you're with it when you're making an industry switch).

I dunno, switching industries is pretty common, accepted and not unusual, and I like to believe this happens in Singapore too. Switching doesn't have to have anything to do with professionalism: a lot of factors come into play, often related to the employee's personal life and well being (marriage, moving, stress management, change in life priorities etc). Most mid-size to big companies acknowledge this, and I've yet to see any stigma associated with someone who came from another industry who's willing to pick up something entirely new.  Source: have screened resumes for a boss who favored ""diverse"" profiles.   Also, I'm not sure why OP singled out teachers.

Maybe it's just me but I feel so imbalanced. I need some red and yellow... Otherwise it just feels very.. Biased... (Not hinting on the content or anything). Also, I don't like the section headings (home, business etc) to be white.

If you're checking your phone thinking ""oh please let it be time to go home"" then obviously you don't want to be there and obviously you wont enjoy it.   The writer sounds like a socially awkward person forcing himself to do cool things to try and fit in with his peers. Maybe he should grow a backbone and tell his friends ""nar, I'm not into clubbing anymore"" instead of writing passive aggressive whines online.    That said, Clubbing is a stupid activity. You buy over priced drinks, you dance to overly loud music. it lacks logic, it defies common sense and rationality, but what makes clubbing fun is that you get a bunch of friends and you do all this stupid shit together. You dance together, you drink together, and you wiggle your eyebrows in amusement as one of you poor sods trys to hit on that girl."

He's that idiot who tags along ""cool people"", and be willing to be the sacrificial lamb for things like paying for drinks or sending the drunk idiot (who blacked out) home.

Talk to the taxi driver on the way home.  Most nights I pay $20~ because of the cab fare, and that's cause none of my girlfriends live remotely close to hougang.   (My boyfriend isn't in SG, and he knows I'm partying and is ok with it. I don't flirt with any of the guys or lead them on, they just offer us drinks and we take it.

Singapore is relatively small.  You can probably travel to the whole city in a day but to fully experience it, you'll need a few days.  It's also not a cheap city especially anything with alcohol.  I had just a few beers at a bar and my tab went up passed the $100usd mark.  I'm not sure how that compares to NYC but in Houston, TX, it's out of this world!  The food is amazing.  I always have to get the Chili Crab and Chicken rice.  Enjoy your trip!"

singapore,3bmuka,sreudian_flip,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:14:34 2015 UTC,"It kinda depends on how you travel. If you're a laid back traveler, you'll probably want to have more time on your hands.   At the same time, it also depends on what all places you want to go to. A lot of the tourists skip a couple of the touristy attractions like the singapore zoo or the bird park etc, depending on what they want to see.    The best way probably is to go to one of the touristy places in the day and then chill at one of the bars/clubs in the evening. It doesn't make you super tired at the end of the day."

singapore,3bpsdn,CatWeed,-13,Wed Jul 1 04:51:43 2015 UTC,"lol, these ""SPGs"" are mostly attracted to white guys because they have something most of the locals don't - a buttload of awesome stories and experiences, plus an individualistic charm that isn't hindered by lack of company. What do the locals talk about? NS and their jobs and ""crazy times with the boys"", which is mostly drinking and hanging around. What do the white guys talk about? Their solo trips, their crazy adventures, their take and opinion on things.  Also if you ask a white guy to do something or go somewhere, he'll do it. If you ask a local to go somewhere, he'll be like ""who else is coming? If he come then I come. If they come then I come. If there are many people, then I oso.""  If I were a girl, I'd go for a white guy too. Except the Germans. Fuck the Germans."

singapore,3bpsdn,NXMT,13,Thu Jul 2 03:46:46 2015 UTC,"For those Asian girls who read this and feel discouraged:  Don't worry - OP himself has admitted that he's shallow (nothing wrong with that. To each is own!), and I believe most guys aren't like him. I hope I'm not - I'll take (have taken) the awesome girl whom I can read and play computer games with any day over the turnip. I believe there are many people who don't conform to the stereotype out there and it's presumptuous to assume otherwise.  Also, keep this in mind the next time you hear an SPG go 'OMG white guy ftw'. This is how Asian guys feel all the time with the inherent racial discrimination.  As for the guys - before you go ahead and agree, try to empathise and imagine if a girl said the same thing:   I love white guys. It's true. I'm tired of being politically correct and denying that I prefer white women over Asian men, just so I don't offend friends. And by friends, I mean the friends who scoff at me for liking only ""white"" and who say I discriminate, while they act all high and mighty about how they show no such preference (although I know they secretly do - the humble-brag they do everytime they've even so much as talked to a white guy is proof enough).  I've always been afraid to say this out loud. I don't know why. I didn't want to be seen as racist or whatever. Or that I look for white guy arm candy because it's awesome social proof here. I've been trying to convince myself to be more inclusive, and force myself to think of Asian guys as attractive. I swear, I tried looking at guys at the buses and the MRTs and tell myself, ""Look! He's handsome! Isn't he? Isn't he? ISN'T HE?"" But I don't.  I came to this conclusion yesterday, after a date with someone I've been seeing on and off for some time. The signs that he wanted to take it to the next level were there, but I couldn't commit. And that's when it hit me. I felt I was settling, when I'm clearly attracted to men who're white. I know this sounds super shallow, but I'm going to say it anyway... given a choice between a super smart, funny, well-rounded Singaporean guy and a ditzy blonde with the IQ of a turnip, I'd choose the turnip.  I told him that I honestly didn't see anything going ahead for us, and he understood. And now I'm free to pursue what I've always wanted to do. I don't care for those who think I'm shallow. I want to chase white guys.  Another friend of mine feels the same, and we've talked about this at length. We like white guys because we find them hot (hotter than Asian guys) and that they're more sexually liberated. Don't bash me for saying ""White guyd are easy"". I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that Asian men aren't as upfront about sex as white guys are. Asian guys do so much of posturing and round-a-bout ways of showing interest, it's maddening. Anyway, we are committing to spend less time on interacting with Asian guys, and more on white guys. It just works for us.  So much for background. This is the request part: we are looking for fun people to team with us, and be part of our nightly pubbing and clubbing. We like to check out the expat places and interact with white guys. The conditions are:  Must be outgoing and engaging in her own right. We like to approach guys head on and work on that impetus. The last thing we need is someone awkwardly hanging around like deadwood.   Must be a ""Yes (Wo)Man"". Within reason. We don't do anything dangerous. We just don't want wet blankets who complain. We like people who can go with the flow, wherever that flow may take us.  Must really know how to hold her liquor. I'm serious. If there's one thing white guys (mostly) are good at, it's drinking. We encourage crazy behavior, but not stupid stuff, like puking outside clubs.  A good feel of the bar scene in Singapore is a plus. It will come in handy when taking guys to places they haven't been before.  I know this is going to get so much hate and downvotes, but still I look forward to PMs from anyone interested, and anyone who feels the same like we do. Group whose members share similar goals get things done better. Peace!"

They have careers and want to be independent. They don't care about the tai tai bullshit.   Why would you get downvoted? It's fine bro. Personally I like both.  What I don't agree with though is the sex part. Both ""races"" are equally prone to it. Maybe Asian girls won't talk about it openly but they want it as much as anyone else.

singapore,3bil7y,singawhoreAMA,2,Tue Jun 30 01:53:06 2015 UTC,"These are some incredible shots! I've been to and through the park hundreds of times and it is beautiful, especially the view from the higher units of nearby flats. But as others have said, not nearly as striking or vibrant as your photographs :)"
singapore,3bil7y,singawhoreAMA,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:31:26 2015 UTC,Its my second time there and I guess its all about perfect timing and lighting. Lighting this nice which i don't need to post process alot comes very rarely!
singapore,3bil7y,singawhoreAMA,2,Mon Jun 29 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"Wow, I been there but it never looked so pretty to me. Nicely taken! Please do a marsiling one (MRT walk out there's this reservoir and looks so serene in the evening)"
singapore,3bil7y,atxy89,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:02:18 2015 UTC,Oooo! When I've the time I'll check that place out!
singapore,3bidcu,PsshImAmazing,57,Mon Jun 29 13:52:15 2015 UTC,"Can you get to the nearest Neighbourhood Police Station now?  There's also a hotline to the Ministry of Social and Family Dev. that has a specific department for child abuse/neglect, however it's only from 8-5 during the week.  The number is 1800-777 0000  Give them a call ASAP"
singapore,3bidcu,feladirr,11,Mon Jun 29 14:04:33 2015 UTC,"I definitely can, thanks for the idea.  Is there a way where my parents don't hear about this? They are pretty serious about kicking me out if I don't obey them, and I really just want someone to help me cope through this and guide me, because I understand there is no perfect outcome."
singapore,3bidcu,feladirr,30,Mon Jun 29 14:21:31 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't think they're legally allowed to kick you out as a minor but I can imagine that there will be reprecussions for you at home if they do find out. Do you have any school counsellors or confidence teachers that you can speak to? They are legally bound to keeping everything between you private, except if you tell them that you're planning on or already are hurting yourself or anyone else. If your teachers know you, then I doubt they'd believe your parents/dad's lies about you being a delinquent.   I'd seriously suggest giving the hotline a call and asking them how to deal with this"
singapore,3bidcu,chubbypun643,9,Mon Jun 29 14:24:05 2015 UTC,"I second seeing a counselor. Put simply, it's an expert willing to hear you out. He/she'll have appropriate advice for you. I don't know about your school's counselor, but most I've met are really friendly people. Go and look for them!"
singapore,3bidcu,TRex_Eggs,7,Mon Jun 29 14:34:38 2015 UTC,"can imagine that there will be reprecussions for you at home if they do find out.    Probably that, yeah. I do have school counsellors, I'll probably go see them. I may give the hotline a call if I get the guts, thank you so very much for all your help in this matter."
singapore,3bidcu,palysg,5,Mon Jun 29 14:31:42 2015 UTC,i hope you do get the chance to get help before it becomes too late. take care.
singapore,3bidcu,PuddingDuck,2,Mon Jun 29 15:08:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the support! :)
singapore,3bidcu,j_fat_snorlax,10,Mon Jun 29 15:17:48 2015 UTC,"To be honest, being ""kicked out"" should not be seen as necessarily a bad thing. If your father can beat you now, who knows what he could do in future? We all hope that family counselling will help you find a ""happy ever after"" ending. But I hope for your own sake that you be mentally prepared for a worse outcome."
singapore,3bidcu,j_fat_snorlax,3,Mon Jun 29 14:30:34 2015 UTC,"You could approach one of the family service center near your house as well. There will be social workers and counselors there that could help you. Sometimes i encounter FV cases in my job but those are only cases that has been reported,  seeing you crying for help on Reddit really worries me."
singapore,3bidcu,banyt,26,Tue Jun 30 01:37:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of redditors have told you to talk to the police /counsellor. That's the right thing to do. But no matter what the circumstances, don't lie or exaggerate your situation. I'm not saying you are, I'm just telling you that in case you're tempted to, and I know it's tempting because my grandma tried that when she was getting away from my abusive grandfather and she lost all her credibility after that, even though most of the abuse she claimed was real."
singapore,3bidcu,palysg,12,Mon Jun 29 14:59:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, that's sad :(. I don't plan to exaggerate at all."
singapore,3bidcu,banyt,3,Mon Jun 29 15:18:42 2015 UTC,Good for you. And good luck!
singapore,3bidcu,benjiliang,26,Mon Jun 29 16:24:05 2015 UTC,"in my opinion too that's abuse  if you could tell someone at school whom you trust and/or the police I think that would be a good start  if you have friends who are mature enough (how old are you, incidentally?), it's good to reach out. it might not help, but it's very important to have someone to talk to.  left inside, the hurt will fester."
singapore,3bidcu,doxob,9,Mon Jun 29 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, do you think a counsellor would work? I've thought of it but worried the counsellor would breach confidentiality. I'm 16. My friends are reasonably mature, but I don't want to burden them with my problems.  Thank you for the advice once again."
singapore,3bidcu,Hope83,12,Mon Jun 29 14:22:42 2015 UTC,I personally know people who work as counsellors. Please be assured that they are professional people who will know what to do. You need to tell them your concerns on confidentiality and they will act accordingly.
singapore,3bidcu,Hope83,6,Mon Jun 29 14:31:26 2015 UTC,Thank you for that. I'll probably go see the counsellor as soon as possible.
singapore,3bidcu,FayBooLess,5,Mon Jun 29 14:32:15 2015 UTC,"please, please tell your friends if you can trust them.   I have seen personally what comes of bottling things up. you don't want to start on a road that ends with self-harm, depression and anxiety.   confidentiality; there are three scenarios where a counsellor can break confidentiality:   to prevent imminent physical harm to yourself or another if required by law with consent   I don't want to scare you, and I know you are under a lot of stress, but counsellors have broken confidentiality without due cause before.   that said, you should be fine. it's hard to get a good counsellor in Singapore, though. I suggest an external organisation.   check the Counselling and Care Centre out. nonprofit, $30/hour, in the Chinatown area."
singapore,3bidcu,resurrexia,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:22:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, plus i think the daily beatings would fall under preventing imminent harm part...please don't let that discourage you from seeing a counselor, just be aware that is a posibility"
singapore,3bidcu,bat-affleck,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:52:28 2015 UTC,don't worry. they are professionals.
singapore,3bidcu,wornmedown,16,Mon Jun 29 14:55:45 2015 UTC,"As redditor feladirr has written, the Child Protection and Welfare Helpline is 1800-777 0000.  Your priority should not be on whether you will end up in foster care and affording of textbooks and such. Your physical safety and sanity is more important.   Speak to your school counselor, show your school counselor and teacher all the resulting red lines and marks from the beatings. If your school counselor and teacher doesn't raise the alarm, then that means they are not doing their jobs.   The protocol is that upon alerting the teacher, the teacher is supposed to inform the principal. And if you are not under any direct physical danger, the principal is still supposed to inform the police and the ministry.   Don't allow the threats from your father to deter you from seeking help.   If you need further assistance, drop me a pm."
singapore,3bidcu,mwolfee,5,Mon Jun 29 14:48:47 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean. I sometimes focus too much on working for the future because I somewhat have given up hope on my childhood ever being something I will remember fondly. I'll speak to my counselor tomorrow.   I hope it could be resolved peacefully, but I understand maybe it can't."
singapore,3bidcu,mwolfee,5,Mon Jun 29 14:57:28 2015 UTC,Keep us informed after you speak to your counselor. Please make sure to show the counselor all the marks and bruises (if any). Don't exaggerate but do not downplay the situation in any form either.
singapore,3bidcu,mwolfee,2,Mon Jun 29 15:05:07 2015 UTC,"I actually did downplay the situation here a bit, I wouldn't do that with a counselor, you're right."
singapore,3bidcu,wornmedown,20,Mon Jun 29 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"OP, please PM me. As chance would have it, I'm working on a project regarding family abuse. I'm happy to share more information regarding the avenues of help you can consider and approach, as well as some of the ways you can resolve the situation, both legal and otherwise."
singapore,3bidcu,austinlsj,5,Mon Jun 29 14:56:51 2015 UTC,"Please see a school counsellor or the police. If they know what they're doing, they will know how to help, and possibly how to remove your from your abusive environment.  I note that in your comment below, you're the same age as I am. That means many of our peers may not be mature enough to handle the situation without causing extra problems (leaked info to their parents who might contact your parents, et cetera). However, if you've got friends who you're close to, whose families you can trust, and have parents that might be able to help you, please approach them for help. They might not be able to support you professionally, but they can provide some psychological support.  On another note, good luck for O's! Do not, do not, let unfavourable circumstances get in the way of dreams."
singapore,3bidcu,iemfi,2,Mon Jun 29 15:30:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I'll look into that, that is a good idea.  And likewise to you :) I'm rather nervous for oral coming up."
singapore,3bidcu,lawdudette,4,Mon Jun 29 15:31:27 2015 UTC,"Make a recording... Like using your phone or something? Voice record would do.  There are apps that record voice (even video) discreetly.   As in, the screen shows something else (web browser or something), So you can even put your phone in the open and he wouldn't realize.  Then bring that recording to your most trusted adult (teacher?, relatives? Professional counselors?)"
singapore,3bidcu,blindsid3,3,Mon Jun 29 18:42:35 2015 UTC,"OP, go see a doctor to get medical treatment if you need any and get the doctor to record your injuries. Then go make a police report for record. Whether you want to press charges or not, have records so you can count on them as evidence.  Do you have siblings? Do your parents treat them the same way? Is there another relative you can count on to protect you?"
singapore,3bidcu,noober98,2,Mon Jun 29 14:49:06 2015 UTC,"Go see a doctor   My parents would probably know and I'd be treated much worse. I have no siblings, and few relatives, none of which my family is close to."
singapore,3bidcu,benjiliang,5,Mon Jun 29 14:56:03 2015 UTC,"How will they know? PM me if you need any help seeing one - I'll help you pay for a consultation at the GP, and your parents will not have to know."
singapore,3bidcu,noober98,3,Mon Jun 29 15:12:45 2015 UTC,"Oh I have money (I save up most of my food money), but they insist on keeping tabs on wherever I go. And they'd probably find out if I spent quite some time at the doctor"
singapore,3bidcu,joshlightman,3,Mon Jun 29 15:17:38 2015 UTC,"Hm, I see, I see. I hope you're not going hungry saving up the food money though.  In any case, please do update us tomorrow should you go see the school counselor, I think it's important to tell someone that's in a position to help."
singapore,3bidcu,CaiPngIsLife,4,Mon Jun 29 15:20:29 2015 UTC,"Definitely, I'm wondering if I should make a update post, but I think that might also be redundant.   I'm not going hungry certainly, I eat one meal at school, so I am quite reasonably fed."
singapore,3bidcu,scribblesinthefire,4,Mon Jun 29 15:22:28 2015 UTC,"Okay, glad to hear that. Make an update post if you want to. I can't speak for everyone, but I think some of us here will be interested to hear what happens.   Until then, stay safe, friend."
singapore,3bidcu,junnir,3,Mon Jun 29 15:24:46 2015 UTC,"Sure, I will. Thanks for the support!  And don't worry, I'll be safe- this shit's been going on for years :/"

singapore,3bidcu,Cybersteel,5,Mon Jun 29 15:08:15 2015 UTC,"Hey man as a fellow 16 year old and a single child , I sometimes get verbally abused by my parents a lot. They keep saying how I'm not as good as the kids of other people like their friends and always dragging me down. All I'm saying is I'm willing to help a fellow single child out if it's within my means, let me know if you need anything."
singapore,3bidcu,thefatkittycat,2,Mon Jun 29 16:01:46 2015 UTC,"Document it well, photos of the injuries at least. I suspect the deck is stacked against you in Singapore, thanks to Asian Values and all that. Also apart from the stuff others have said are there any relatives who could help? Grandparents?"
singapore,3bidcu,teochewmueh,2,Mon Jun 29 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"Hey OP, whatever your parents did fits within the legal definition of child abuse :( Please, get out of your family home fast. You may think you are keeping it together now, and I think you really are doing a good job of it now, but there really will be long term effects on your psychological well being should you decide to stay on. Kudos to you for wanting to protect yourself, good luck and keep us updated!"
singapore,3bidcu,bedokboy,2,Mon Jun 29 18:57:40 2015 UTC,Find a place where you can set up your smartphone out of plain sight and record an incident. Thats what I'd do anyway.
singapore,3bidcu,Tusjecht,2,Tue Jun 30 03:23:46 2015 UTC,"Here are your options:  A:Tell social services/the police  B:Tell a friend that you trust  C:Tell a teacher that you trust  D:Tell the school counsellor(s)  It's best not to keep silent about it, it's better if you tell someone. Of course, document your injuries at very least and get an audio recording or even a video of your parents abusing you. Hope this helps."

singapore,3bnc1d,sense_make,6,Tue Jun 30 16:31:29 2015 UTC,"As an undergrad who has lived in undergrad halls, its not as strict as it seems. Don't make a ruckus and no one would bother you. I don't think I've heard of anyone getting evicted before either.   Do you intend to bring your girlfriend over to Singapore to stay permanently in your hall? I'd say thats a bad idea. What would she be doing? The hall space is pretty cramped. Its also not easy to get a job as a foreigner. She just wouldn't have anything to do other than to wait for you to come home from classes each day.  If she's just staying for awhile like on a holiday then I guess it would work. My girlfriend stayed with me in my hall some nights as well. But not on an extended basis.  The undergrad halls are usually bustling with hall activities. Which can be a major distraction from your studies. I'm not sure about the grad halls. I'd assume that they would have less of that though.  NTU halls are close to the jungles. So insects are more prevalent than usual. Food is easily available anywhere on NTU campus. However, note that on certain days like public holidays, nothing is open in NTU.   NTU campus is also kind of ""isolated"" from the rest of Singapore, giving rise to the nickname ""Pulau NTU"" which means NTU island. You have to take a bus out of NTU in order to reach some semblance of civilisation. The bus ride is about 15-20 minutes to the nearest shopping mall named Jurong Point.    NTU is also located at the extreme western side of Singapore. Takes about 1hr to get to the city centre by public transport. Take the bus from NTU to the train station and its about 14 train stops to town.  Although if you just want to shop and eat, you should just head to Jurong East MRT station instead. Just 3 train stops about. There are 3 shopping malls and a new hospital in that area. You can literally find anything you need there. No reason to go any further than that other than if you want to go sightseeing."

Same if I have friends coming visiting from Sweden they'd wanna stay with me instead of a hotel in town.  I've been to Singapore before and I know my way around, and now decided to do my masters in SG to be closer to her and make it easier to get a job in SG since my M.Sc is local instead of Swedish. Been travelling so much to SG all throughout my undergrad studies. Not too familiar with the NTU halls though. :P"

singapore,3bl5yz,KaseyRyback,5,Tue Jun 30 07:37:44 2015 UTC,"job advertisements requiring mandarin (for retail sales jobs of all places - doesn't make sense.   Why not? It makes sense if they already have enough English-speaking staff, and if their clientele comprise of monolingual Mandarin speakers eg. the older generation, Chinese tourists. Even in Europe, it's quite common to see mandarin-speaking salespeople that specifically cater to Chinese tourists, especially in the branded boutiques."
singapore,3bl5yz,cowbungaa,2,Tue Jun 30 08:21:11 2015 UTC,"well... it of course depends on the company, industry, market, job.  Anecdotally speaking from places I've worked at if there's an employee conversant in the native tongue of the customer, they'll use it [commonly Chinese [i.e. encompassing Min, Yue etc], Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Hindi, Tamil]. Notwithstanding the usage of English as the global standard (well mostly) for commerce, using their language when communicating verbally makes things a lot easier very often. Not to mention the other often mentioned benefits associated with being able to 'speak their language'.  Anecdotally again, Chinese nationals are one of the main groups this method is useful. Sure their manager may be able to speak English, but he/she ain't always got time for you. China isn't the only place but as pragmatic Singaporeans we're going to make use of whatever historical advantage we have [it so many Singaporeans are of Chinese descent]. Of course it's also open to the gahmen to eliminate race and language distinctions and make everyone the same through social engineering; but that is beyond the scope of my reply.  I mean, to what extent really, did you think that SMRT's attempt Mandarin train announcements were targeted at Singaporeans?   I also noticed that while Changi airport had directional signs in Japanese (and no Tamil) no one cried about it, or at least not loud enough.  People want to make money off other people with money; most people with money can English well enough, but it's not the case for the rest. Chinese people have money, but a significant portion of them don't do the English.   I mean it's open for everyone else to leverage their language and cultural skills. I'm sure every community does so.   They could do a study, but I think even accounting for what I've said, most jobs predominantly use English for all purposes.  TL;DR all I can say is businesses adapt, even in Western countries, where there's Chinese money involved they'll seek to find ways to have Chinese speaking people on their team."
singapore,3bl5yz,Azuredrak,2,Tue Jun 30 09:01:29 2015 UTC,"Well my earlier comment was only directed towards retail jobs. For other jobs,  whether it's reasonable or not depends entirely on the job scope. Say if the job requires you to travel to China to discuss business deals, then it would not be unreasonable to have a mandarin-speaking requirement."
singapore,3bl5yz,SG50cent,0,Tue Jun 30 09:06:55 2015 UTC,"Depends, lets say that your major client is a Chinese who refuses to speak anything other than Mandarin, and that you need employees to attend to him.

singapore,3bl5yz,SG50cent,5,Tue Jun 30 09:47:25 2015 UTC,I've wondered about this. Isn't it better for the company to reject the applicant after the interview while making up some BS reason rather than putting something discriminatory in the advert?
singapore,3bl5yz,Azuredrak,2,Tue Jun 30 12:33:23 2015 UTC,It would be better indeed.  I suppose some companies are unaware of the guidelines or simply don't take them seriously.

singapore,3bk6we,Pure_Moments,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:16:45 2015 UTC,Well the doctor says I'll work after a week or two. Just happens that I get the side effects immediately.
singapore,3bk6we,Aethyr314,3,Tue Jun 30 10:13:52 2015 UTC,"Antidepressants aren't fun and good luck with it!  The side effects do wear off but you'll be suffering for a bit. I was on lexapro and I had various side effects: the first few weeks my appetite just plummeted and I lost about 2kg as a result. Then it all came back with a vengeance and I ended up gaining about 6kg. When I tapered off it and stopped, I ended up gaining another 4kg. My activity levels and food consumption remained the same (I tracked my food intake with MyFitnessPal).  Other problems were nausea. There were days where I just didn't go in to work because I just felt like I was going to throw up the whole time.   Another issue I had was erectile disfunction. My sex drive became non-existent. I was put on Wellbutrin to help combat this and it did work but it was still 3-4 months of problems in the bedroom followed by a very low libido for the remainder of the time I was on the medicine.  Coming off them isn't fun either. You may experience weight gain and your thoughts become completely whacky. Things like confusion, nausea, dizziness etc (brain zaps).  Things will get better though. The meds are just there to help you improve. You're not going to be on them forever and they're just there to help you get you back to yourself. Once you're feeling better, you can start coming off them and live your life out again. It may take some time but you will get there, I promise!  Just remember that exercise is absolute key. It'll be even harder to motivate yourself to exercise but if you can make it into a habit, you will feel better. Here's a subreddit for help/motivation: /r/EOOD"

It's not that my loyalty to Malaysia has changed, rather the country itself. I don't understand the paranoia of Islam in Malaysia. Wearing skirts; we're seducing Muslims men, eating in front of them; we're seducing them out of their fasting period, non-muslims using the word 'Allah' to refer as God; we're confusing Muslims between our gods and their God, printing Malay-version bibles; we're seducing Muslims into Christianity. But every morning and evening, they air their Islam chanting from every mosques in the country so loud that the entire neighbourhood could hear them but it has never been a problem for non-muslims. The word 'Allah' is used in the national anthem but we don't care for it. We have the Malay privileges flaunting at us but we have gradually accepted it.   This is just stupid.

Imagine if everyone was normal, and how boring that'd be.  It honestly just sounds like you fall closer to the introverted end of the spectrum, and there is nothing wrong with that. It isn't social awkwardness, but you being worn out by all the social interaction, and you just need time to yourself to recharge.  With regards to the signs about people disliking you, it's difficult to discern much from what you've said, so I shan't speculate. I would just take a look at the topics you usually bring up compared to those your friends do, and then go from there.  Have you taken an MBTI test? It isn't and shouldn't be the be-all, end-all, since everyone is socialized differently. However, it has helped me in finding people that are at least somewhat similar. For example, if you visit the sub for your type, you'll find that you are most likely not alone in who you are."

What hurts my confidence a lot is that when I first got to know this person (let's call her A) we kind of hit it off (non-romantically fyi), but now I get the sense she doesn't really like me.

I've just never been there.   The uncle then proceeded to ask me how to get there and I said I didn't know. Then I hinted that maybe it would be nice to invest in a GPS or something similar.   Uncle said, ""No need lah, got street directory can liao.""  Then after a few minutes proceeded to ask me for the road to get there again. I tried to give him the directions I had from gothere.sg and I said it should be his responsibility, not mine, to know how to get there. Apparently, he said I was speaking nonsense and then refused to follow the route that I provided. He kept on asking me how to get there again... afterwards.  I'm usually quite polite, but I couldn't hold it in and I said that my name is NOT street directory.  He then accused me of providing him the wrong address. (It wasn't. I checked the address from my email, their website and google.) We actually stopped at the side of the road for about ten minutes as he perused his Street Directory to no avail. The whole trip took 20 minutes more than it should have and about twice the suggested amount on gothere.sg. I just gave him $15 and left the taxi.  I slammed the door on my way out and he shouted  ""Miss ah, you very ungrateful leh!!!"" to me as I tried to rush to my destination that he caused me to be almost late to.  My heart. It boils."

singapore,3bi3sy,Mikeferdy,29,Mon Jun 29 12:15:07 2015 UTC,"The stuff about gay marriage leading to bestiality or pedophilia isn't because the concept of consent is hard to understand--it's because they have no interest in understanding it at all. For better or for worse, it's far more comfortable for people already entrenched into social circles full of people who condemn gay marriage to repeat, verbatim, the arguments of others, without any regard for how logically correct they are.  The latter two points about drug use or pornography are more contentious. I'm afraid I can't agree that it is as obvious as you seem to think that government has no right to regulate what people do with their bodies in their own time. However, I do agree that drug and pornography decriminalization are good ideas from a strictly pragmatic perspective--there's no actual quantitative reason to oppose drug legalization, which seems to actually decrease drug use and drug overdose. So perhaps I would suggest approaching the issue from that perspective and not a moral one."

Based on the link provided by /u/onique , lifetime drug usage rate in Portugal actually increased compared to pre-legalisation.  In addition, you can't really compare Portugal to Singapore because the drug situation in the 2 countries is very different. Prior to legalisation, Portugal already had a drug problem - their policies were clearly ineffective at eliminating drug usage, based on their lifetime drug usage rate of 8% in 2001. In contrast, Singapore's drug usage rate is a ridiculously low 0.005%. To use an analogy: imagine it's raining and you are carrying an umbrella. If the umbrella has 10 big holes in the middle, you might as well throw it away because you are going to get wet regardless. But if the umbrella only has a tiny hole at the side, then you'll obviously stay drier if you didn't throw it away."

This also goes into several other issues. When it comes to cannabis, why is it so hard to understand that what a consenting adult do to his own body should not be a government's purview.  Personal possession of adult literature by adults of legal age is also technically illegal. Why is the government so controlling?   in my opinion too, a person's body belongs to him alone.  that said, there is an argument for law as a form of social engineering: you make illegal behaviour that you find distasteful in order to engender a ""better"" society. do you believe that law is not such an instrument?  to put it another way: do you believe that only acts that are malum in se - inherently evil - should be prohibited, and those that are malum prohibitum - wrong only because they are forbidden - should be decriminalised?"
singapore,3bi3sy,banyt,3,Mon Jun 29 14:00:32 2015 UTC,I don't agree that the Penal Code is suggesting that minors can consent just by saying that stat. rape is rape regardless of consent -- the idea is that minors are completely unable to give consent. Basically a minor giving consent in any form counts for nothing because they aren't informed enough to make rational decisions regarding certain issues.

You cannot deny the very fact that we live in a society, and as such, an individual's actions DOES have an affect on society at large. The government being the elected representative of society is given the power by the people. The mandate is not from heaven but from the votes of the people. So its basically the PEOPLE controlling THEMSELVES. Because majority voted for it. How does one's decisions have an effect on society? Firstly and obviously, take drugs, overdose, go to hospital, increases burden on public institutions. Get addicted, become destitute, once again, burdens public hospitals. Using CPF as an example: a Libertarian might say 'We should be able to do what we want even if it kills us'. Thus, we should be able to spend all our CPF savings and then die of starvation. Its our choice, govt shouldnt control us. But on the other hand, the Socialist will say 'No, we cant just let them die when their CPF savings are empty, we must use public taxes to help them out. For we live together in a society and should help each other out'. Government basically has to toe their policies in between the two.   Edit: Trust me. You would not want to live in a purely Libertarian state.

Yes, in principle, if it doesn't harm anyone, it should be legal. But most of the time, it is harmful to others, just that you are unaware of it. Porn itself is harmful because it exploits disadvantaged women. Sure, there are 'ethical' adult studios but when browsing porn, there is no way you can tell. By consuming porn, you create demand for the exploitation. Another example, smoking, causes diseases to the smoker. The smoker has to go to the hospital, burdening a public service, thus affecting society at large. Almost nothing you do is in isolation."

If what you mean is the lack of opportunities are causing women to turn to porn then that exploitation could also apply to fast food chains employing people aren't able to find a well paying full time job.  Conversely, countries that have harsh laws against pornography often have very limited education/jobs opportunities for women. Sexual repression however, is real. When the outlets for these frustrations are illegal, they become dangerous due to the lack of proper business regulations, ie. Abused by pimps and lack of regulated testing for STDs. Can't report to authorities about abuse without fearing of arrest themselves. This is true exploitation to me."

If humans do evolve to a stage when 14 and 15 year olds are able to give informed sexual consent just as adults do, I don't see what's wrong with redefining laws to reflect what's best for society. The principle of the law is to protect minors that are unable to give sexual consent, whatever age may be defined.  Even if it were natural to have pedophilic urges, the fact is that pedophilia is criminal because children are unable to give sexual consent.

Think about it this way - if the argument goes that same sex marriage should not be allowed because it could lead to the legalization of things like incest, then you could just as easily argue that the current form of institutionalized marriage should not be allowed either because it's what gave rise to the fight marriage equality."

The whole point is that same sex marriage is not any more relevant to things like bestiality than straight marriage is. It'd be like arguing that bestiality should be legalized because we have achieved racial or gender equality. Where is the actual connection? Regardless, the argument that bestiality or incest should be legalized just because same sex marriage is allowed isn't actually more valid than making the same argument with straight marriage instead.  The problem is that you're arguing on the platform that homosexuality should be treated differently from heterosexuality. But why should it?

We no longer have to have heterosexual committed relationships in order to breed and to ensure the species don't die off.  Women no longer need men or children to have a fulfilling life, for example.  Committed same sex couples should be accorded the same marital rights in the eyes of the law not because of some romantic ideal but because of pragmatism.  It has mostly to do with decisions that needed the next of kin to sign off. When the same sex couples are not recognised in the eyes of the law, even when they have been in a committed relationship for decades, the partners are not allowed to make eg. Medical decisions or sign off death certs etc.  I understand that there are different laws for different countries and certain paperwork to be done to possibly circumvent this, but why should a committed same sex couple be made to jump through hoops so that their combined assets and life be protected?  In Singapore, if there is no living will drawn up, the partner gets nothing... because the CPF etc will go to the parents and siblings.  Edit: In response to your ""cost of sex is lower than IVF""... You do know that there are unwanted children everywhere right? Do orphanages ring a bell? If there is a problem that I see is - straight sex is TOO cheap these days.

These days, it's more like marriage is the ultimate declaration of one's love and commitment, regardless of whether a child is involved. Marriage also involves federal benefits and protections for the married couple. Why exactly should same-sex couples be excluded from this when one's sexuality has no relevance to those factors?   I don't think Straight marriage was created or allowed from the standpoint of ""equal rights""   If marriage was created by Man, and if the concept has evolved through the years, then where is the issue with making it more inclusive?  Marriage has also existed way before religions were involved, so let's not use that as an excuse to maintain the status quo.   ? creating babies to replace the population is not a functional difference? I'm sure the costs of sex is less than IVF for everyone.   Are straight couples going to stop having babies if same sex marriage is legalized?

I actually agree with you on this. If something is not a medical or physical disorder, and if it doesn't harm anyone, I don't see the reason for prohibition.  That being said, I'm just clarifying the fallacy with the slippery slope used by many that we should not legalize same sex marriage because it will lead to the legalization of other vices (as viewed through a religious or subjective moral lens) like incest and bestiality. That connection doesn't really exist though and it merely serves as a red herring, because just as the fight for gender and racial equality were fought independently, the same goes for the movement for marriage equality.

Why not? That's how equality for the LGBT community has been achieved.  For the record though, bestiality and necrophilia are considered mental disorders if they interfere with one's ability to function, whereas homosexuality hasn't been considered to one for close to 40 years.  As mentioned above, the medical and scientific community have long had the consensus that homosexuality is perfectly normal and not a disease. Ergo, the logical and objective conclusion is that there gay people should not be discriminated against (i.e. anti-sodomy laws repealed), and this view has gained majority recognition over time.  Expanding the view that gay people should not be treated any differently from straight people, it leads to a valid argument that not allowing the LGBT community to participate in marriage construes a form of discrimination too. Hence, same sex marriage has been legalized to address that issue.  If you want to fight to achieve equal rights for things like bestiality or incest, you just have to go through the same due process a social movement like LGBT equality has. Prove that they are perfectly normal, show that current laws are indeed discriminatory, lobby for equality and campaign to get wider societal support for one's cause. For what it's worth, I'm not a fan of requiring wider societal support to act as an impetus to repeal or amend laws shown to actually be discriminatory, but it is what it is."
singapore,3bi3sy,ceddya,0,Wed Jul 1 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"I also have concerns about the methords use to remove homosexuality from the the Mental illness list, quoting   Then you should probably cross reference with sources like this that contradict the claim that there was no empirical data that led to the decision. Also, you really should check your sources better. The article actually supports the claim that homosexuality is not a disease, and the point of it is to criticize the DSM for the way it classifies things (quote: 'And if poor adjustment is critical to a diagnosis of mental illness, where was the evidence of this that justified making homosexuality a mental illness in the first place?')  That being said, it's pretty telling that homosexuality is still not considered a mental disorder despite there being multiple studies over the 40 years since its declassification. Not only that, but that view has expanded and been accepted by every credible medical organization (including our own HPB).   eh you lost me here. I thought the whole LGBT movement and gay marriage was accepting people who WEREN'T normal, as humans who still had rights. I don't think anyone is really ""normal"" and people just twist and turn the word ""normal"", you even have 7 year olds changing their gender these days.   The whole fight for equality is that homosexuality is just as normal as heterosexuality, which means that there is no justification for any discriminatory laws.  Also, your example of 7 year olds changing their gender is pure hyperbole.   some/most Laws are always discriminatory in the fact that they are applicable to some, yet not others. such as national service, isn't it a form of discrimination to pick only guys instead of all people? I'm using the definition from dictionary.com   Your analogy is wrong though. If homosexual individuals are no different from their heterosexual counterparts when it comes coupling or relationships, then there isn't any real reason to exclude them from marriage equality.  On the other hand, I don't think anyone actually denies the unfairness in making NS a male-only thing. Then again, it's pretty well-accepted by Singaporeans, which is why there isn't any impetus for change. You're free to start up a movement if you want though.   but I'm scared that ""equality"" is being thrown around so often. most people claim Humans are all ""equal"", does that make their deviant behavior equal ?   Homosexuality isn't deviant behavior though, so how exactly does it justify discriminating against the LGBT community? Whether you like it or not, fundamental aspects of a person (race, gender, sexuality) tend to be more protected when equality is involved, which is why you tend to see more momentum when it comes to such rights movements."

singapore,3bi3sy,ultronisright,-1,Wed Jul 1 01:29:27 2015 UTC,Even in the West the concept of 'consent ' is pretty new and a lot of people don't understand it.

singapore,3bi3sy,thebeautifulstruggle,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:04:02 2015 UTC,"Well let's just talk about pedophilia for a bit to understand this concept of consent.   I assume that the argument that consent between LGBT couples (or more) is mutual, but if a 15 year old kid was to agree to a sexual relationship with an adult this consent isn't mutual because the law deems that the 15 year old mind isn't mature to give consent.  Now, if you think about it carefully, if a 15 year old 364 day ""child"" is legally not able to give consent, but the very next day, is legally able to give consent, what is the logical underpinnings behind this ""age of maturity""?  To those that are above or close to the age of consent, do you yourself feel that there is a certain clarity of thought that was borne out of this particular birthday?  My point is that the age of consent is also a legal construct that was created by man. So while pedophilia for some reason is morally abhorrent, the way we legally apply it is completely incorrect too.  I'm not making any argument on or against sides, but if you think about it, we're in quite a bit of a conundrum in my opinion about our one-size-fits-all legal system."

singapore,3bi3sy,the_rumblebee,0,Mon Jun 29 14:54:35 2015 UTC,"If you think about it logically, the argument that 'animals cannot give consent' is a terrible argument against the slippery slope argument coming from the conservative side.  If we need consent from animals before having intercourse with them, then we should need consent as well before killing and eating them.   Hence, if you want to use the argument that 'animals can't give consent', then you must bite the bullet and become a vegan. Or, you can also bite the bullet and tell the conservatives that bestiality is okay. Just goes to show that liberals aren't any smarter than conservatives, both sides use terrible arguments and reasons."
singapore,3bi3sy,Wheat-gen-stein,-1,Mon Jun 29 14:57:20 2015 UTC,"The issue of consent that OP raised is not just on the level of sexual intercourse. After all, sex toys can't give consent. OP specifically brings up the issue of ""equal marriage rights"".   By simply characterising the issue as ""we don't need consent to have sex"" is a gross mischaracterisation of the debate. In the case of pedophilia (not the simply attraction, but the act), there's the additional element of providing a level of protection for the more vulnerable segment of society, based off the potential (and actual) harm that may (and will) result.  In the case of bestiality, did you know that having sex with dead animals isn't against the law?  377 (Sexual penetration of a corpse) only deals with ""human corpses""  and  377B (sexual penetration with living animal) of course, only deals with living animals.  But the above isn't the issue. Marriage rights require consent under the common law system, given that both parties are treated as equal partners to a relationship (ideally). Given that in samesex marriage, the participants are adult (and therefore able to give informed consent when signing the ROM), and that there is no quantifiable harm (unlike in pedophilia cases, additionally, see the Minors Contract Act and the Infants Relief Act for the doctrine of consent under Singapore law), why should samesex marriage be made illegal?  Of course, I am coming from the position that everything should be legal until there exists a reason for it to be illegal and sanctioned. Therefore, the burden of proof as to why something should be illegal should be on those that argue for its illegality and sanction.  Edit:  I'll just throw out a quote by Judge Posner:  ""Unless it can be shown that same-sex marriage harms people who are not gay (or who are gay but don’t want to marry), there is no compelling reason for state intervention, and specifically for banning same-sex marriage."""

But there're other aspects like the texture of the flesh, colour, size of the seed, etc. As for MSW, I've found that its flavour tends to be more...complex. As in you taste sweetness, then the bitterness then it has that slight heat and aroma like you have when drinking spirits.

singapore,3bi1lj,renasma,10,Mon Jun 29 11:49:18 2015 UTC,"TCM generally contains a lot of steroids.  Steroids are compounds that are also used in Western medicine, but with great caution, as it can lead to some pretty serious side effects in specific groups of patients who are not supposed to be taking them.   That being said, however, steroids are generally effective against a broad spectrum of common ailments and diseases. They are anti-inflammatory agents, and are commonly used in conditions such as asthma attacks, or kidney disease.   Some aspects of TCM are indeed evidence-based, and these include things like ginko. Evidence-based medicine means that objective studies (relative to TCM at least) have been conducted in populations either local or international. For instance, it may have been shown that, say, out of 1000 patients who use Drug A and B for Disease A, 900 show better improvement with Drug A compared to Drug B. Therefore, Western doctors would advocate Drug A to treat Disease A. (after taking into account a whole bunch of other factors)   However, despite TCM leaning towards the evidence-based medicine side of things these days, a large part of TCM is still practised anecdotally and based on the 'gut feel' of the TCM physician, especially in TCM clinics which aren't well regulated. Please correct me if I'm wrong about this - it's been a while since I've spoken to a TCM student/doctor, so I'd appreciate an update!   To the average patient: I am not saying that you are wrong, but if you're comfortable placing your life/part of your life in the hands of someone who prescribes you seemingly rapidly effective medications based on their 'experience', instead of evidence-based medicine, you have the right to do so. If it makes you feel better from your illness, by all means go ahead. Bear in mind that this goes the same for your average white-haired (and possibly outdated) GP who still prescribes you codeine mixture for cough.  But I wouldn't. If I really had to I'd visit the ones with like...Eu Yan Sang or the one at AMK Thye Hwa Guan Hospital.   Although I fucking love pi pa gao. I'll drink/eat it even if I'll die.

I'm sure most people here are capable of realizing what parts of TCM are blatantly flawed. What may not be so obvious, however, is that TCM has many components that do actually work in treating disease that are not fully recognized by modern medicine.  For example, artemisin derivatives are extremely well-suited for the treatment of malaria [1], and has been used for this purpose for multiple centuries. However, it has only been recognized by modern science for half a century. Perhaps more strikingly, TCM remedies for leukemia have been shown to improve treatment outcomes [2].  There is still a lot of pharmacological work to be done, and don't get me wrong--much of TCM is flat-out bullshit homeopathy. But even now, we are successfully isolating new drugs from TCM (and Ayurveda) [3] that potentially have clinical impact and significance, so I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss it as ""bogus"" or ""horse crap"" as others here have done.

You also gloss over a separate issue: TCM can also make things worse and harm you. Two of my friends have permanent damage from being brought to TCM practitioners (by their parents) for fractures. The damage isn't major, just mild deformities / bumps, but in one case the treatment was very painful (the fracture was inexpertly manipulated by the practitioner), and in both cases going to see a western doctor would have fixed the issue. The worst part for me, is that one of my friends' takeaway was: ""oh, I just didn't go to the right TCM doctor and didn't get the right TCM treatment"".   Further, as a consumer you cannot be reasonably assured about the contents / ingredients of the TCM product you obtain from a TCM practitioner, nor do you have any rigorous knowledge about its potential side effects.   It's true that there may be as-yet undiscovered drugs in TCM, but I think treating it like it has some degree of legitimacy or efficacy, and going so far as to say that it has ""nonzero efficacy, period"", is very dangerous.   I would argue that on balance, TCM has negative efficacy, its utility limited to the knowledge that scientists can gain out of exploring its tenets; regular folks would do far better to go to a competent ""western"" doctor to get their stuff sorted out."
singapore,3bi1lj,theony,2,Mon Jun 29 23:13:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clearing it up. It is exactly that TCM itself is unable to determine if its treatments are actually viable or not. Most of it is guesswork and its theories (meridian points and the like) are clearly poppycock.  What the scientific method brings is the ability to distinguish what works and what does not, what harms and what cures. TCM has only merely provided a narrowed field of herbs and minerals from which one can begin their search for pharmaceuticals."
singapore,3bi1lj,alterise,3,Tue Jun 30 03:42:47 2015 UTC,I think there might be something to it if it was scientifically tested and peer reviewed. But mostly its woo-woo.
singapore,3bi1lj,Mikeferdy,7,Tue Jun 30 10:46:02 2015 UTC,"For the longest time, I don't believe in TCM. I am a believer of science and western medicine.  But one day my wife and I went to a TCM. The doctor was able to accurately diagnose my condition just by checking my pulse! My condition was subsequently confirmed by a western doctor. So I now give credit to TCM for accurate diagnosis.  Can't say the same for TCM's medication though. I don't think it was that helpful."

singapore,3bi1lj,Clockworkkubrick,2,Mon Jun 29 13:26:33 2015 UTC,I use it for really bad ailments that don't go away like having constipation and diarrhea. Modern medicine can't cure these ailments like TCM can.
singapore,3bi1lj,chocfreckles,2,Mon Jun 29 12:45:37 2015 UTC,"Don't use TCM for ailments like cough and flu but i definitely go for tui na or acupuncture when I injure myself or sprain something. I used to be a skeptic and did not want to go for tui na when i sprained my ankle, but my parents insisted and i'm glad they did. I find that if the tui na person is good, i heal much more quickly.   Conversely, when i don't go for tui na after a sprain, i've found that i don't heal properly. I sprained my big toe once, didn't realise it was a sprain and thought it was no big deal so i didn't go. A few months later, I realised it had not healed properly when i would feel it hurt after walking too much or even during cold weather sometimes.  The caveat is that you must go to the sinseh asap, like within the day. When I sprained my thumb, i did not go until a few weeks later because i was staying in uni hostel and the tui na place was at the other end of the island. By the time I went, the sinseh could not do much for me because scar tissue or something had already formed at the base of my thumb. So while it doesn't normally hurt now, i can't bend my thumb fully. Which to me is proof that the Western 'treatment' of RICE (rest, ice, compress, elevate) doesn't work, because that was exactly what I had done.   And oh if you suspect a dislocation or fracture, do not go to a sinseh. One of their biggest weaknesses is that they have no x-ray and might not be able to tell if it's a fracture, and tui na might make it worse. A good sinseh can usually tell, but it's best not to take the risk."

TCM, like the OP says, has a lot of grey areas that Western medicine can't explain. But I've gone to a TCM doctor and he was WAY BETTER than my GP. true story. (the GP just gave me LOADS of antibiotics which I suspect was because she wanted to earn more $$$. She always hands out antibiotics like water without fail, which was what prompted me to look for a TCH physician for my never-ending bouts of flu..the antibiotics, obviously, didn't help much and only served to give me constipation)  For the naysayers, how about trying it out before shitting on the whole TCM thing?

Googled Bell Palsy, and surprise surprise:    Usually it gets better on its own with most people achieving normal or near-normal function. Many show signs of improvement as early as 10 days after the onset, even without treatment.   There's a lot of money to be gained by the big pharmaceutical companies from developing new drugs. That includes testing promising TCM methods. Whatever is useful we call medicine."

singapore,3bi1lj,kosherjellyfish,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:22:46 2015 UTC,"Gua sha:       Gua sha (Chinese: 刮痧; pinyin: guā shā), meaning ""scraping sha-bruises"", is a traditional Chinese medical treatment in which the skin is scraped to produce light bruising. Practitioners believe gua sha releases unhealthy elements from injured areas and stimulates blood flow and healing. Gua sha is sometimes referred to as ""spooning"" or ""coining"" by English speakers, it has also been given the descriptive French name, tribo-effleurage.   Gua sha was borrowed into Vietnamese from China as cạo gió. This term translates roughly ""to scrape wind"", as in Vietnamese culture ""catching a cold"" or fever is often referred to as trúng gió, ""to catch wind"". The origin of this term is the Shang Han Lun, a ~220 CE Chinese Medical text on cold induced disease - like most Asian countries China's medical sciences were a profound influence in Vietnam, especially between the 5th and 7th Centuries CE.  Cạo gió is an extremely common remedy in Vietnam and for overseas Vietnamese. There are many variants of cạo gió. Some methods use oil balm and a coin to apply pressure to the skin. Others use a boiled egg with a coin inserted in the middle of the yolk. The egg is wrapped in a piece of cloth and rubbed over the forehead (in the case of a fever) and other areas of skin. After the rubbing, when the coin is removed from the egg, it will appear black. [citation needed]  It is also used in Indonesia, and in Java it is known as kerikan (lit., ""scraping technique"") or kerokan, and it is very widely used, as a form of folk medicine, upon members of individual households.

Legit TCM clinics are actually good (there's one at Alexandra I want to recommend), while those shady TCM clinics that pester you to buy their ginseng powder non stop are quite bad. This is purely anecdotal on my part, but when I had a slipped disc, the hospital just told me ""surgery or physio+pray"". I then went to numerous TCM clinics. I initially went to a few shitty ones didnt help and were a waste of money. Finally, I went to this clinic at alexandra that charges no consultation fee, only fees for the medicine.

If anything it'd make more sense to compare Singapore to an individual US city like Los Angeles or New York City.  I also thought the comparison to east vs west is interesting. When I meet Singaporeans I feel like we're pretty much exactly the same until we get into social issues. Like where I'd argue that freedom of speech is a huge priority many SGs I met thought safety was more important. Or I argue for the legalization of drugs and personal freedom it seems many SGs argue that drugs should all stay illegal and harshly punished. Obviously gay marriage is a huge thing here and overwhelmingly accepted among young people, but that's not necessarily the case in SG.

singapore,3bjnq9,xeroorc,4,Tue Jun 30 06:42:59 2015 UTC,"I'm PES E1L9, serving in my unit's multimedia team. We get called up to cover events, which can happen in varying frequencies.  My team (we have a few PES E guys in here) just came back from a four-month stint at SEA Games. We had an exciting time doing production work (filming etc) for the Games. Two of my PES E colleagues were subsequently being deployed at this year's NDP too.  I've heard of PES E guys who also become PAs (Personal Assistants) to high-rank bosses. Depending on how well your boss treats you, your life as a PA can range from awesome to horrible. Most of the time it's the former though hahaha, based on what I've heard from friends.  Allowance is the same across all vocations for the same rank.  Not sure what you exactly mean by ""how many admin vocations are there?"" but I guess there are countless. Admin vocations exist behind any system that works in the force; they are the backbone of the organization --so we're we thought during the month-long PES E BMT training haha.  Just a heads up about the month-long PES E BMT training though: it will consist mainly of lectures about the SAF core values, basic soldiering lessons like how to fold your No. 4 sleeves and tie your boots, lots of administrative stuff like choosing your insurance and answering a questionnaire about how adjusted you are to military life, etc...  It might come across as very mundane at times, but the greatest takeaway you can expect from this is the friends you will make during the training. I recommend bringing along a book to read too. :)  The platoon sergeants and officers for my PES E BMT were awesome guys, and it was nice hearing from them about the lives that our counterparts lead in Tekong.  Another heads up - you might hear of word that PES E personnel would usually be offered stay-out vocations. That is utter nonsense. I've had a PES E platoon mate who was posted to a stay-out camp in mainland, and on the first day after reporting to said camp, he was told he would be posted to Tekong as a stay-in clerk there. Oh life...  Also, my two PES E colleagues and I are technically stay-in personnel.  I suggest having yourself mentally prepared for anything that comes even though you'll be in PES E."
singapore,3bjnq9,xeroorc,5,Tue Jun 30 06:35:44 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, doing admin work is way worst than chiong sua. you have to handle office politics. 8 years ago when i was in NS i was posted to a branch that reports to CDF, COA, chief of air and chief of navy. we practically are untouchable. but we do alot of programming and report churning. what we can see in the database was the career progression of every tom dick and harry to their nok, to their salary to their future paygrade etc. who ever u want to see we have it. there was a corporal holding a major estab, we loled at him. i remember we were informed by another department to change a NSman gender to female. I loled, they said the guy called to tell them that he have undergone sex change and have been receiving letters of reservist. she told them to stop sending the letter as SHE doesnt want her husband to Know. I LITERALLY LOL! and nearly died laughing out in office. oh and there was 1 guy literally in DB since 1987. Apparently they took the rifles from tekong and rob a jewellery store.   Food wise is good, but expensive. my time was 350 for corporal. 350 - 100 dollar transportation = 250 - (3x24) food = 178. technically i have 178 left for everymth. problem is 178 is the same as now. if you go out on weekends = gone.  how to earn more is help people do guard duty."

On a side note, I see so many synergies on this acquisition.   3- Are you wary of expanding into other regions where similar apps such as OpenTable already have strong market penetration?  4- Following up on the previous question, what is the one main thing you do better than OpenTable?  5- Were you surprised your no show rate is lower than phone bookings?

Possession or consumption of cannabis:  Up to 10 years of imprisonment or S$20,000 fine or BOTH   Illegal traffic, import or export of:   Cannabis of more than 500 grams - May face the death penalty Cannabis resin of more than 200 grams - May face the death penalty Cannabis mixture of more than 1,000 grams - May face the death penalty   however wikipedia states that only anything >15g of cannabis = presumed trafficking, so you might be able to get off on that charge. see how your lawyer argues for you, i suppose.  i'm not a lawyer, this is what i gleaned from a google search so.. best of luck either way. also, GET A LAWYER! reddit probably isn't the best place to get help for something as serious as this.  tl;dr: most likely all 3, facing jail + fine, maybe caning. probably no death penalty."

This may not be the police's or the Attorney General's Chambers' interpretation. You will need to be able to back up your claim. A lawyer will be able to help you make representations.   Be cooperative with the police, but not to the point of prejudicing yourself. If you don't know the difference, get a lawyer. If you have no money, apply to the law society Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.  Your sentence (if any) will depend a lot on your circumstances - whether you have antecedents, whether you are a productive member of society, etc. A lawyer will be in a better position to assess the range of sentences and mitigate on your behalf.  If you have the means but don't want want to spend the money to engage a lawyer, but want to understand the criminal process, spend a day in the State Courts.

If you can fight that and make it go away and you co-operate fully — as is really fully, rating out your supplier — you might be able to avoid prison.   Also, how old are you?

singapore,3bh3fc,X-Boner,3,Mon Jun 29 04:25:49 2015 UTC,"I certainly don't think it's a bastion of gay rights. It's just that there have been vocal protestations about it becoming legal which have been sidelined, and it's made global news.  I'm not from the U.S. by the way so please don't misunderstand my position as one of condescension. I love Singapore and I think it's a great country to live in - and most things here are done far better than many ""western countries""."
singapore,3bh3fc,pizzapiejaialai,6,Mon Jun 29 06:15:42 2015 UTC,"There is a great conflict resolution tool in business management called the Thomas & Killmann grid, and quite frankly, the G's playbook, with regards to gay rights, comes from there.  We're never going to reach a collaborative outcome when you have religious folk and gay advocates on either side, and competing outcomes leads to friction of a degree that leads to systemic breakdowns of the social fabric.   Gay rights is an emotive issue and many proponents may balk at this sort of technocratic toolset being used to affect their private lives, but governing is about managing people, millions of them at a go."
singapore,3bh3fc,Slavor,11,Mon Jun 29 07:29:48 2015 UTC,"The ultra conservative piece of legislation you're referring to was adopted from the British, and I would say has remained on our books due to there being no overwhelming support from the public to change it.  The government here always has stability in its mind, and such a divisive issue has and will continue to split the people of Singapore. It's really a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation, with the religious and liberal on opposite sides of the fence.   While Westerners (sorry for the generalisation) are principled people, the approach taken by the government is ultimately a pragmatic one. People are free to love as they please, in public and behind closed doors (though please observe obscenity laws here hahaha), and while the law may criminalize gay sex it's the enforcement (or lack thereof) that shows the government's stance on it.   Tl;dr it's a compromise to maintain stability in Singapore with regards to this sensitive issue."

singapore,3bh3fc,irlando,5,Mon Jun 29 04:22:06 2015 UTC,That's interesting to know - I guess I have a somewhat skewed perspective because all my Singaporean friends are very liberal. Or relentlessly gay ;)

singapore,3bh3fc,Locnil,5,Mon Jun 29 06:24:25 2015 UTC,Large minority? Do you mean vocal minority? Or majority? My brain is being divided by zero when you say large minority.  Perhaps some clarification?
singapore,3bh3fc,pizzapiejaialai,10,Mon Jun 29 04:33:17 2015 UTC,"Large minority, in that they're technically still a minority (<50% of the population), but still quite a large segment, and hence politically influential."

What is important to keep in mind as well, as that in Singapore, it's not just adherents of Christianity that are the major factor pushing back on gay rights. We have the added complication that in general, Muslims in Singapore aren't so hot about gay rights either. Look at the online uproar when Pink Dot unveiled a Malay ambassador this year."

Even if recognising gay marriage isn't on the horizon, decriminalising sexual acts between homosexuals would be a great first step.  There is a really vocal conservative religious voice here, and it can be difficult to reason with them without their faith getting in the way.

The recent legalization of gay marriage in the States have already sparked much debate and even blatant religious outrage here in Singapore.  The amount of retweets going on here in regards to gay marriage signalling the end-times is ridiculously popular among youths.
singapore,3bh3fc,guoshe,5,Mon Jun 29 17:24:05 2015 UTC,"About 377A (the law prohibiting sex between males): It was adopted from British law. A lot of people here do not want it repealed.  The following is my own opinion, so feel free to disagree. Singapore's conservatives would see the repeal of 377A as ""giving in"" to LGBT people, and as the start of a steady moral decline into Disgusting Western Values or whatever. I don't think they really want to ban gay sex as much as they don't want to un-ban it. In other words, I think that if 377A weren't already a law, people won't be pushing for it to be one."

For the most part it is believed that if gay sex were allowed, soon gay marriage would be allowed, and gays would be normalised... you know the drill.  If it were a matter of people being used to the status quo, the reaction to 377A's repeal would most likely be apathy rather than the strong opposition it currently faces (many religious institutions, Wear White, etc)."

I don't think most people would think so far ahead until gay marriage -- though the SCOTUS thing would have had an effect, which is a shame because marriage equality imo distracts from more important LGBT issues.   but like I said.. too little data on this issue (and no wonder, too)"

So you can implement laws that the majority don't like. You can implement laws without democratic processes. Just please don't call that a democracy.   Yes, death for apostasy is terrible and wrong.

The journey is approximately 6 hours, but I've been delayed two hours and another friend was delayed four. You'll be glad for the extra you paid in cases of traffic delay.   The coaches have Wi-Fi on board, but I've never used. I think it's something you pay on top of that, but I'm not entirely sure. You can call to check.

I usually have a few stocked at home. My favourite is tarako sauce.All you do is boil pasta, stir in the sauce, and sprinkle on any additional toppings if have. I sometimes poach an egg in the pasta water also (after taking out the spaghetti).Including the cost of pasta it works out to about $3 per serving. (I portion 100g dried pasta / serving) Not as cheap as instant noodles uh but cheaper than ordering mcdonalds and don't need to go out. [total cooking time about 15 mins with poached egg]  I also keep a container of muruku around sometimes but it doesn't last very long. Big box of meiji crackers lasts longer.  Other things I do when living alone:   Go to sheng siong, and check the frozen food there. Usually they'll have some kind of frozen dumplings. I like the cabbage ones. 1 bag got 20 dumplings, 10 is good for a meal. About $4.50 per packet. They're good boiled, better if you pan fry them, but pan fry = bigger mess + oily.  [takes 15 mins to boil, longer if you want to pan fry them]  Frozen fried chicken chunks. I remember this to be kinda expensive per portion but you basically get a big bag of fried chicken, and put a handful of fried chicken in the toaster oven for about 20 mins. Don't need to defrost. The chicken's been fried before they freeze it so it'll still come out crispy. I keep a bottle of kewpie mayonnaise around too. [20 mins, but no supervision required]  Macaroni salad. I learnt this from my filipino maid last time. Not everyone's taste. You boil one whole bag of shells and drain it. Let it cool. While it does that, mix mayonnaise with condensed milk. How much? Idk lol. I usually taste as I go. You end up with a kinda sweet dressing. Then I toss the whole thing together with raisins and tinned fruit. Let it chill before eating. Makes about 5 or 6 portions. [takes about 30 mins, maybe longer, and you can't eat it right away.]"

Most of these people were high-ranking generals, or at least a BG. The thing is, as far as the military/civil service is concerned, there's a huge hurdle to cross to get from a Colonel rank to a BG rank (from crabs to stars), an individual who manages that would prove that he/she is not only a top scholar, but also the elite amongst the elites. So when these people retire...they are often revocated to helm statutory boards or any other public organisations due to their track record. This means lower chance of screwing up.   Where these people are concerned, it's no longer about their field of expertise, it's about their general abilities and management skills. This is also why you often see successful non-tech trained CEOs leading the large technological corporations. The higher the level of the employee, the more strategic based his/her jobscope is, a soft-drink company CEO doesn't necessarily need to understand how to make soft drinks because he/she would have a large number of technical experts to take advice from."

That being said, a holder of SAFOS, has a quicker trajectory than a normal career officer which retires at 60. Desmond Kuek was a SAFOS holder and took 3 decades to be CDF. That means he was only in his late 40s.  As he did nothing wrong, but the government could not let him continue as CDF for too long (tenure is between 4-5 years), the next step is to retire from Military service at a young-ish age to either run for public office, or get appointed in a directorship of a Temasek Owned GLC, or a Permanent Secretary in a Ministry as a step up on their Payscale."

singapore,3becn0,pizzapiejaialai,3,Mon Jun 29 08:11:05 2015 UTC,"What /u/Azuresdrak and /u/sjoldboy said are pretty much spot on.   Most of these C-level executive appointments are based on the government's scholarship scheme. Basically, if you aren't in a 'fast-track' route, ""farmer""-level scholars have to work towards a masters in public administration. In general, these scholars rotate in various governmental agencies in DS - PA (Deputy Sec / Perm Sec) roles and pretty much have to perform or get 'culled' (nicer terms - failure to break the set 'glass ceiling' / henta kaki).  In general, these guys are all pretty intelligent but it's a whole different ball game on evaluation (execution/decisiveness etc). The downside of this system is just that these dudes aren't 'specialized' - they are very good at managing big organizations but don't have the specialized knowledge (say if they get shifted to a tech-based firm or board they need technical expertise - that's where their support staff come in handy).   In general, it's either you're a scholar (fast-track/farmer), farmer or a peasant(iron rice bowl) if you intend to work in govt (there's a scheme and unless you're on scholarship - u can't reach high levels of management, say akin to a DS or ACEO position)."
singapore,3becn0,kizdean,4,Mon Jun 29 06:59:12 2015 UTC,"Public service leadership. To get the LTC rank, even ""farmer"" officers must study for a Masters in Public Administration (rather than a MBA these days) to prepare for senior management. The high-fliers you listed typically have 3-4 of these advanced qualifications: a Masters in his preferred specialty, then a obligatory MPA/MBA, then an Advanced Management Program at a renowned business school.   Also, no, they're not business executives per se at that level, but running a stat board, government bodies or GLCs. They take charge of the corporate strategy & let their chief financial officers & business vice-presidents balance the books. So it's more of a executive director or managerial job. But, yeah, not everyone succeeds.  The board of directors of the organizations make the appointments, but the candidate pool tend to be small because such jobs are filled by Singaporeans who must have the seniority. Why aren't non-military officers ""helicoptered in""? They actually are, but to other government bodies (stat boards, diplomatic corps, universities, as perm secs to head ministries, etc.). The latter also have more leeway in choosing their Masters (Public Policy, Law, etc. in addition to MBA) along the way."

singapore,3becn0,ayam,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:28:40 2015 UTC,"My own opinion:  Our military has the biggest budget (hence being seen as the most important branch in SG). Therefore, they have the best scholarships available for the brightest minds while they are in school. They are hired and trained to do the job they are supposed to do (in SAF).  Due to the physical demands of the job (and to allow new blood to lead to keep the force dynamic and modern), it is policy that they have to retire at 45 years old. You have to give some job security to the best minds of their generation. How else can you attract the new bloods to sign on if they see that the end of the bright tunnel is so near? Besides, they have the experience (applicable or not is debatable, but they better be good in something) to lead a big organisation and had their own trials of fire during their stint.   However they could be placed in training in how the private sector works before they parachuted into their civilian roles before they actually take them on. Like under studying the current leadership of the organisation they will be leading. This time could also be assessed to see if they are the right fit of that organisation.  TLDR: they are the best in their generation. It will be a waste to let them retire."

As long as they don't keep trying to push those opinions to me I don't mind. And no, I'm not just referring to conservatives trying to push their views. Modern liberals are just as likely to push their views and can be just as nonsensical and with the same sense of smug superiority."

In any case, ask yourself: are your views valid and cogent? If they are, are you being shunned simply because they are conservative and therefore, outdated? If so, then you need better friends. Are you supporting your positions with valid and cogent arguments when you bring them up? If not, then why? No one should have to take your word for it. The burden is on you to convince them. If you choose to rely on intangible and polarizing premises such as religion, then you should be ready for others to dismiss you, simply because they are unable to relate to your personal beliefs. Stick to tangible, empirical arguments, instead of faith-based ones.  Also, are your views simply being criticized, or are you actually being ostracized because of them? Know that if you choose to air your opinions, then your audience also has the choice to challenge and critique them. Do not mistake it for shunning. Next, if you are constantly harping on your views on certain issues, liberal or conservative, your chosen audience might simply be tired of listening to them. Sometimes, people just want to talk about inane shit, and that is absolutely fine.  Finally, you seem to imply a degree of condescension in referring to the ""younger generation"". If you venture into a discussion with that sort of holier-than-thou attitude, then you have already lost your audience. Try to approach it as equals instead. Do not assume every younger individual is head-strong, and knows less. Additionally, do not assume you know more, or that your opinions somehow hold greater weight just because you have a few more years in your pocket."

Liberals views are more towards acceptance to those who are different, accepting freedoms and actions as long as it doesn't harm anyone else, accepting human rights, freedom of speech, etc.  Conservatives are traditionalist, afraid of the new and different, forgo freedom in the name of conformity, retain traditional views in the face of new facts and knowledge.

Singapore is a multi-religious society, and hence it should respect ALL religions and their beliefs.

Again, playing devil's advocate, certain religious people would feel oppressed if same-sex marriage is legalized and ""imposed"" upon their community, which may result in god's wrath and/or that they have failed their family, friends, and fellow citizens.

singapore,3bdpr2,simbunch,4,Sun Jun 28 11:54:03 2015 UTC,"and be a little honest with yourself, then the question is how do you define oppression? What kind of issue(s) is regarded as an oppression? Most importantly, who has the authority to decide what's oppression or not?   Denying someone equal rights based on one's religious beliefs seems like a clear cut case of oppression. There's probably a good reason why every credible human rights group thinks that's the case too.   Again, playing devil's advocate, certain religious people would feel oppressed if same-sex marriage is legal and ""imposed"" upon their community, which may result in god's wrath and/or that they have failed their fellow citizens.   This is such a logical fallacy though, because same-sex marriage has absolutely zero imposition on the religious community.   Churches or mosques are not forced to conduct ceremonies for same-sex marriages, and certainly no straight person is forced to marry someone of the same gender just because it's legalized.   which may result in god's wrath and/or that they have failed their fellow citizens.   Again, one's personal beliefs should not be an imposition to others. It's a very simple concept."

There's probably a good reason why every credible human rights group thinks that's the case too.   Again, I repeat this over and over again, they do not seek to oppress. They seek to defend and protect. You need to be able to see it from their view in order to even begin a meaningful conversation, else the entire effort is just a monologue within the liberal echo chamber. This is why I've never attended a single Pink Dot event, even though I am a huge advocate of marriage equality.   because same-sex marriage has absolutely zero imposition on the religious community.    Again, this is from the point of view of non-religious people like us. You cannot say that legalizing same-sex marriage will impose nothing on them. The interpretation of religion is a very subjective thing.  Also, we live in a world whereby we are constantly being imposed upon by other people's beliefs (eg paying income tax). It's called the social contract. To say that doing so is wrong is intellectually dishonest."

You need to be able to see it from their view in order to even begin a meaningful conversation,   Again, you can argue empty rhetoric all you want, but the end result is the oppression of the fights of the LGBT community.  If you want a meaningful conversation to be had, then the opinions of the oppressed are also important. The whole religious argument that it's for the 'good' of society or the LGBT community crumbles in the face of scientific and medical backing that there is absolutely nothing wrong with homosexuality.

I'm wholly Christian, just fyi, and I don't see any logical and objective argument as to how same-sex marriage affects anyone beyond those who choose to participate in it. The fact that no one will be forced to conduct or partake in same sex marriage leads to the obvious conclusion that there won't be any imposition on anyone.  Again, this fundamental concept seems lost on you, so I'll repeat it - people are entitled to their views, just don't use those views to impinge on the rights of others. People are more than free to believe what they want (homosexuality is wrong, same-sex marriage will have a negative impact on them), but those exceedingly subjective and unsubstantiated views should not be allowed to restrict the rights of the LGBT community.   Also, we live in a world whereby we are constantly being imposed upon by other people's beliefs (eg paying income tax). It's called the social contract. To say that doing so is wrong is intellectually dishonest.   And how exactly is same sex marriage comparable to income tax? What an absolutely terrible comparison this is."

singapore,3bdpr2,SirPalat,2,Sun Jun 28 13:31:47 2015 UTC,"It depends on how the issue is framed. Conservatives don't necessarily dislike change, conservatism simply espouses evolutionary change (compared to revolutionary change). This does not mean conservatives are against change altogether.   Human rights and social equality are well established values that are apolitical. So pro-gay marriage people can be conservatives, as long as the implementation is bottom-up and comes from the grassroot, and not dictated by a small group of people or top-down, and it's being framed as an issue of human rights instead of gay rights. To facilitate this, a meaningful conversation needs to occur first, and not just a bunch of loud people talking down on the rest on either side."

The video doesn't show how the kid's car got scraped. For all we know, it could have happened while the lady was parking her car.  Honestly, if they both backed into their spots, it would seem unlikely that the kid sideswiped her while exiting. We don't even see the lady's car or camera move. If there was contact that caused visible damage to the kid's car, it more than likely would have caused the lady's car to sway to the left at least a tiny bit. She would have definitely included that in the video. However, it only starts with him just exiting straight out.  We also see the kid turning right to exit the area. If that was his intent all along, it's also not likely that he would have scraped his front passenger area unless he was turning left to go down the back alley.  Not taking sides, because the kid was definitely an idiot as well. I just don't think the video tells us the full story."

I just don't think anyone should be so quick to lay all of the blame on him. The video only shows his retaliation, not what had transpired prior. We only have the lady's word for that, and frankly, I don't think  it's worth a whole lot. If she is in the right as she so claims, why not just show the full video, beginning from the time that either she or the kid began parking?"
singapore,3bay20,Cedosg,2,Sun Jun 28 04:25:55 2015 UTC,It looks like the camera recording was motion activated as she mentioned in her post. So it only activated after the impact of this guy's car hitting her car shaking it and activating it.  Also it's a one car parking lane from the looks of it so the only fault would be her parking too far away from the curb.
singapore,3bay20,condor_gyros,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:24:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you. It makes more sense now with your other explanation as well. Can't really tell from the video if she parked too far from the curb, or too close to the car behind, but it's definitely a very narrow alleyway to park in. Anyway, that's the risk of being lazy, and always looking for a spot that's as close as possible to one's destination. Most people are going to do the same, which means it drastically increases the risk of damage to one's car. Walk a bit won't die one."

It's at 1 Florence cl as Dan2188 pointed out http://i.imgur.com/hsKuTgm.jpg.  So from the video, it looks like she's at the front so if he's parked next to her, he's blocking all the cars behind from coming out. Doesn't make sense.  Since there's only one lane for parking which is the spot dbw is occupying, the idea that she dinged his car is impossible.   What seemed to have happened was that he was parked behind her or other cars and once he tried to move out into the junction, he misjudged the area and scrapped the car parked. (Or she was parked too far away from the curb.)  Rmk's gf was possibly behind trying to guide him out or just plain waiting for him because looking at that lane, it would be impossible to get in as there's a wall if he parallel parked.  Stationary Car was moved because of impact which activated the motion camera so it recorded what happened.  Most of it is theories but it's nearly impossible for Dbw to ding rmk's car."

singapore,3bdqn4,pinksamosas,5,Sun Jun 28 06:39:26 2015 UTC,"Full centres usually are a problem, so like those said earlier registering for another date is the next best choice. Do remember that registering for a later date may make you take the SAT 2 test, though, so do keep a look out.   On a side note I'd really suggest finding a test center that's not so crowded, especially since those with lots of students have extremely messy administration. If possible avoid such areas, since they can very easily prolong the test. 2h for a friend, 1h for me at the same test centre."
singapore,3bdqn4,ipainttheworld,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:18:40 2015 UTC,thanks for the advice!! btw is it very important to take SAT 2?
singapore,3bdqn4,burstapart,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:47:07 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you're applying. Some colleges don't require it, but a lot of the better ones require two SAT 2 tests, which you can take on the same day (but separate from the main SAT). So if you don't take SAT 2 your choice of colleges will be more limited"

singapore,3bdqn4,milanars,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:18:28 2015 UTC,Pretty sure it's a common thing. You can be put on a waitlist though and show up on the day and hope that people don't show up.
singapore,3bdqn4,kaya_toast,3,Sun Jun 28 09:41:43 2015 UTC,apparently waitlist status isn't available in some countries including Singapore :( I decided to just sign up anyway and hopefully CB (haha) will find a test center for me!!

These include series such as ""Webster's United Wildlife encyclopedia"", ""Ferguson New Science Library"", Macmillian's encyclopedia of science"", etc. The thing is, these books seem somewhat important and may come in handy to institutions but I dont know which, and I don't want to just hand it over to the salvation army (it may just end up somewhere useless) or throw them away to a garang guni. Anyone know any place I can donate/sell these to?"

If the content of the books are suitable for primary school children, I would suggest donating it to Family Service Centres or any charity organizations that operates studentcare centres. If you are not familiar, I can always help consolidate a list for you based on the closest such organizations near to your place to make it convenient for you.  If the books are too advanced, then redditor chococrunchbar's suggestion of donating to the universities may be the only viable option.   Alternatively, you could also consider selling them and give the proceeds to charity"

I just saw the map and generally it's fine, but it's good to bring a long.   The first 5KM will bring you up Sheares Bridge so just preserve and pace yourself. The rest of the route is pretty flat so it should be fine. You'll be running to East coast park where it will be windy cause it's facing the sea (hopefully)  30KM on wards is usually where shit gets real. It's pretty quiet through that stretch.

singapore,3b9lyk,CaiPngIsLife,29,Sat Jun 27 02:56:07 2015 UTC,"I think we will get equal marriage before that gets legalize. The image of drug abuse is very simple and entrenched here. I myself doesn't see a need for it, I don't trust people to use it responsibly."
singapore,3b9lyk,aktsukikeeper,4,Sat Jun 27 04:22:01 2015 UTC,"If something is illegal it does not stop people from being addicted to it. Prohibition does not encourage responsible use. If an harmful/addictive substance was legal, users would be a lot less discouraged from searching for help.   Singapore is a major hub for drug traffickers despite our harsh drug laws. The only thing drug prohibition is doing is driving up the prices of drugs and increasing profits for criminal organisations.   If you want your kids to stop using drugs, educate them about them instead of threatening them with pain and death. Isn't it fucked up if you warn someone about the incredible dangers of smoking weed, and when they try it, it turns out to be not only harmless but it feels great as well?  Education is the way to go, not prohibition."
singapore,3b9lyk,wildcard1992,-2,Sat Jun 27 17:32:07 2015 UTC,"Even if it's legal, it doesn't mean that users will be less discouraged to seek help regarding addiction. In the end, we are still a largely Asian society. And with Chinese being the racial majority, there is always the issue of ""face"". It's not something that can be resolved in the next decade. In fact, I'm not sure if it can be resolved within 2 generations.   Legalising the use of cannabis does not encourage responsible use either, from what I can see. It just makes it's use less of a hassle, and allows the government to attempt to benefit from it by taxation. Look at tobacco and alcohol. Would there be as many smokers in Singapore if tobacco were just outlawed? Probably not. Do I know this definitively? No. It's an extrapolation of what I do know. By outlawing it, it makes supply difficult, and exposure unlikely. By removing exposure, you will reduce the number of addicts, discounting them going overseas and getting addicted.   I can't say much about us being a hub for trafficking ever since the Golden Triangle weakened significantly. I have no information on that.  No doubt the prohibition is going to drive up prices, but I'm not sure if it will increase profits for the organisations. It will if they don't get caught every time. Getting caught severely hits your margins, and sometimes, it hits very hard.  The issue with education is not as straight-forward, I find. Firstly, education takes a long time compared to prohibitions and threats. My guess is that you are going to need to look at decades. Next, the papers about the positive effects of cannabis is not yet unequivocal. The stance I'm taking here is not that effects have to be absolutely positive, but rather just strong, peer-reviewed evidence about its effect. At the moment, it seems what is circulating is plenty of anecdotal evidence, and publications of results of its controlled use in its infant stage.   I am of course more than happy if you could prove me wrong by pointing me towards papers that have been published in journals, because I really want to know how the medicinal effects of weed come about."
singapore,3b9lyk,qasderred,2,Sun Jun 28 02:07:32 2015 UTC,"Cannabis is much safer and less harmful than even alcohol.    Everyone at US colleges and universities smokes it, and has been smoking it for the last 50 years, as do most if the professors.  When I went to law school in the US I would estimate that 90% of the students and teachers had used cannabis in their lives.  These were all smart successful people.  You cannot overdose on it, unlike alcohol, so it is literally impossible to kill yourself or seriously harm yourself with it.  Aspirin is much more dangerous than cannabis.    The US state of colorado saw a drop in crime of 10% when they legalized it, mainly because of less drunkeness.  The reason it is not legal is that it has a tendancy to make people think, and question their government.  That is something Singapore could use, being a repressive police state.  I cannot understand your willingness to allow the government to tell you what to do, people in Singapore dont think for themselves."

Randy: Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and...it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but...well, son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored and...it's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or...being creative.

I grew up in New Zealand, one of the most lenient countries in the world of cannabis, and in a school that had a very hippie culture. Two thirds of my school smoked it regularly, and only me and one other in our class didn't touch it (you can get high just standing in the boys toilets).  The result? Most of the class did not amount to anything (Only 20% passed university entrance exams, which required getting 45% in 3 out of 5 subjects). Cannabis isn't a hard drug, but it did dull motivation, drive and ambition.  Singapore's only asset is the talent of its citizens. Unlike NZ/Aus, we are not blessed with vast amounts of land/capita. To remain relevant, we really need to be highly educated and motivated...  If Cannabis becomes an uncontrollable problem, then we can legalize and tax it (at least 150%). But as Singapore is doing a pretty good job keeping it away from our shores, I don't see the need to do this."

singapore,3b9lyk,thespaniardsteve,7,Sat Jun 27 14:55:43 2015 UTC,"The issue with your argument is that it is anecdotal of your high school, but not based on any real data. In the case of your high school - correlation does not mean causation.  There can be many external factors that affected your university rate including wealth, resources of the school, etc. One must look at the system as a whole. Because if you validate your opinion only on anecdotes then you will soon find conflicts - for example my high school. While there were some people that smoked cannabis at my high school, it was mostly limited to a small clique of users. At most, maybe 20% of my school likely tried it once and that's a high estimate. Despite the low usage, only about a quarter of my class went to university - and ironically - many of the ones that did smoke cannabis. Furthermore, I went to Purdue - one of the toughest engineering universities in the US - and smoking cannabis was very common, even with the 4.0 students.  My point is - yes, marijuana does intoxicate you and the chronic abuse of it (or any drug - alcohol, caffeine, etc) isn't good for you. However, like alcohol, responsible use can have no effect, or even benefits, but my main point is that it is important for people to look at real data and draw conclusions off that rather than anecdotes like the ones given."
singapore,3b9lyk,Syptryn,7,Sat Jun 27 11:11:30 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of scientific studies showing the cannabis usage below the age of 21 impedes brain development in teenagers and young adults. See, for example:  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090202175105.htm  While one may argue to adopt a model like alcohol where only people over some age are allowed to consume it - this will make it much more easily available for youth as well. Alcohol is prevalent in our society to control - but cannabis hasn't got a foothold in Singapore yet.   Singapore has very good social support for how much taxes we have to - as we make Machiavellian policies to ensure Singapore remains a competitive society and help us rise beyond all our neighbours. I don't see how legalizing cannabis will help at all."
singapore,3b9lyk,thespaniardsteve,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:45:44 2015 UTC,"Well of course, I don't disagree with the article that heavy use among adolescents impedes brain development. There are also many studies that note its benefits and safety when used in moderation or medicinally- especially in comparison to other drugs that are legal on the market - even unexpected ones like aspirin and caffeine. But my point was that in any debate (whether it is drugs, guns, or any other policy), it is prudent that we use studies and real data to make points - not anecdotal evidence.  While a resident, I'm not Singaporean so I don't really have an opinion on one side or the other. To me it's more of a cultural question than a safety one, but in the end it is up to Singaporeans to decide what they want for their own country."
singapore,3b9lyk,Syptryn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:57:44 2015 UTC,"I agree that light use probably has only small side effects - just as alcohol. However, experience has shown again and again that you cannot just trust everyone to use a addictive drug responsibly...   What the means is that it'll lower productivity, create extra health problems, and ultimately add social cost - causing public coffers to be spent on drug related issues when they can be spent elsewhere (such as research, investments, education... ).   This is not a black and white issue, of course. For example, I suppose legalization of cannabis in Australia/New Zealand/USA. Its so ingrained in society that the costs of fighting it outweigh the costs of treating its abuse (though both are unnecessary costs if no one smoked to begin with). Cannabis hasn't got a foothold on Singapore yet, I'd rather it not suffer the same coffer drain."

In my opinion it should be illegal until 18 years old like cigarettes then completely legal. The main issue to me is that younger people with poor impulse control can waste away formative years just sitting on the couch and I saw it many a time.  That said, living in Los Angeles I saw it every day being used by people from all walks of life. It was largely harmless and much less dangerous than alcohol. I think the world is eventually going to legalize as more and more countries do. If you're around it much you realize it's largely harmless and has a lot of benefits for people."
singapore,3b9lyk,Syptryn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:05:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. The thing is, Singapore has a very Machiavellian approach here. Whenever they make a decision, they're asking ""Will this benefit Singapore as a whole?""  In US, cannabis is so prevalent that the war on drugs is a utter failure, costing immense tax dollars for little gain. As such, it is better to legalize and tax it.  In Singapore, cannabis has not got a foothold on the general society. Therefore legalizing it will make it more accessible to minors, even if it was explicitly only legal for adults. Meanwhile, there will always be a minority of adults who end up abusing it. Both of these are going go cost tax dollars. So, from the governments perspective - why bother?   It is possible Cannabis is less harmful to our society compared to alcohol, but it is detrimental nonetheless. Saying we should allow Cannabis because alcohol is already around isn't the right view - alcohol cannot be banned because it is too ingrained in society. Cannabis in Singapore is not. I am sure if any other drug had the same effects as alcohol was introduced (increased aggressive, used for date rape, correlations with domestic abuse, increased chance of violent behaviour), Singapore would ban it to."
singapore,3b9lyk,Marius_Mule,0,Sun Jun 28 01:56:18 2015 UTC,"Cannabis will reduce your alcohol abuse rates, and it doesnt cut productivity nearly as much as alcohol, which causes absenteeism.  And if you work in a creative field it can actually improve productivity."

singapore,3b9lyk,aborted_foetus,21,Thu Jul 2 18:27:13 2015 UTC,"I think people need to be educated about weed, including its possible long term psychological effects. In a bid to legalise cannabis, I think people can glamourise it a bit too much. Yes, it is nowhere near as destructive as opiates or cocaine etc, but it is not completely harmless.  How do I know? A friend of mine is nearing 50 and all he does is deal, smoke, eat, and game all day. He has become so dependant on weed that he simply does not know how to lead a 'normal' life anymore. Another classmate of mine smokes so much that it ended up really affecting his work to the stage that he might have to repeat a year. Tobacco does not do that to you,  but weed CAN. Cannabis is harmless in moderation but it is silly to dismiss how addictive it is because the symptoms are much milder. People can, and have, become almost psychologically dependant on weed.   That said, I know of many very high functioning people (including my professor) who smokes every once in a while. Everything should be in moderation, which unfortunately is not a quality a lot of people possess.   I don't think weed should be illegal. I think it should have the same status as other controlled substances, such as hard liquor."
singapore,3b9lyk,Singapura,6,Sat Jun 27 06:00:22 2015 UTC,I agree. Another thing is that weed impairs your reaction speed as well. I have friends who get stuck on the couch.

Most people who oppose legalization of cannabis are usually misinformed and blinded by old western propaganda for it is mainly due to underlying racism that spawned the film 'reefer madness' and the subsequent prohibition of cannabis.  Anyone who says cannabis is addictive should actually try it out for themselves. Cannabis is not addictive. You can smoke daily for one month and quit cold turkey without experiencing any withdrawal symptoms. Furthermore, cannabis has an extremely high LD50 which translates into an extremely low chance of an overdose. If compared side-by-side with tobacco and alcohol, cannabis is the least dangerous.  Ever since Colorado legalized cannabis, taxes from it's sale has gone to funding schools and stuff but wait! There has been so much revenue from cannabis sales that the government actually gave some money back to the people.  Legalization is largely positive. Jobs are created, a whole new economy emerges and people do not need to depend on unreliable and sketchy sources for cannabis which generally means a safer and much more consistent product in terms of quality.  However, with legalization comes the problem of underage use. Minors who use cannabis regularly are more likely to have stunted brain development and lesser grey matter in different areas of the brain which may or may not affect overall intellect. This happens because cannabis affects dopamine receptors and those whose brains are still developing would experience much more drastic changes to their reward centers. But all-in-all, research is still being conducted on the harms of cannabis but for now, the safe age for cannabis use seems to be 21 years old."

singapore,3b9lyk,spiritz89,0,Sat Jun 27 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"Doesn't really answer my qn.. For example, are there medical benefits that we can ONLY get from cannabis as opposed to other drugs? Or is the high from cannabis so unique so special that we can't get from sex, chocolate, smoking, drinking and other currently legal substances.."
singapore,3b9lyk,dirtybreakbeat,2,Sun Jun 28 01:20:29 2015 UTC,"Oh right. I don't know exactly what's been proven and what's being overtly exaggerated so now I'm genuinely curious to know the answer to your question.  I do not know how high you can get from chocolate. Cigarettes just make you giddy and nauseous if you try to feel anything. You won't get the hang over from alcohol, you eat better, sleep better. Instead of beer goggles, your senses enhance. Well, sex... I just hope that one day you'll be able to do it high with your partner."
singapore,3b9lyk,AveLucifer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:18:39 2015 UTC,"What can you get from sex/chocolate/smoking/drinking/etc that you cannot get from masturbating etc? It's a completely arbitrary cut off point that you're choosing to defend. There's always going to be a level of deescalation in what substances are able to afford you results, that does not mean we should inherently restrict the options available for no good reason."
singapore,3b9lyk,spiritz89,2,Sun Jun 28 05:00:16 2015 UTC,Not defending the restrictions but not exactly supportive either. Just genuinely curious. I'm happy with my options now so don't particularly see the need to legalise cannabis. Just want to find out if there's anything uniquely beneficial abt cannabis that might definitively convince me to throw my support behind legalization.
singapore,3b9lyk,kiasuking,3,Sun Jun 28 05:38:11 2015 UTC,"i don't really want cannabis to be legalized in Singapore. reason being that research on cannabis shows that ""Cannabis use in patients with a psychotic disorder has a long-lasting negative effect on illness outcome, particularly when persistent. Treatment should focus on discouraging cannabis use. cannabis use and schizophrenia, and the research clearly suggests the link is only in persons otherwise predisposed to schizophrenia There is also research showing increased rates of depression and anxiety in some cannabis users teen cannabis users suffer lon-term memory loss in adult hood and also because there is no conclusive research on secondhand cannabis smoke. for those stating that it is less harmful than smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol, i would like to say less harm does not mean no harm so i don't see the point of introducing a new drug onto the shores of Singapore"

singapore,3b9lyk,dirtybreakbeat,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:08:36 2015 UTC,"These are absolutely valid points but the benefits outweigh the risks by decriminalizing cannabis. Instead of full-fledged outlawing it, perhaps it be a prescribed substance in controlled environment?"
singapore,3b9lyk,kiasuking,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:38:43 2015 UTC,the government controls/ puts age limit on many tings but many of these age limitations are hard to enforce. have seen secondary 2 schools kids smoke and drink in void deck before and just in case you don't know you can wayang to dentist until he can prescribe you chewing gum and plus i stress most importantly that the second hand smoke of cannabis isn't fully studied hence we don't know it effect on a secondhand smoker
singapore,3b9lyk,dirtybreakbeat,1 point,Sun Jun 28 06:16:45 2015 UTC,"What makes you think secondary 2 school kids aren't already smoking weed? And if it doesn't do damage to smoke it first hand, what harm does second hand do? It smells great. Besides if second hand smoke from burning cannabis products can get people high I assure you the world will be a better place today."
singapore,3b9lyk,AveLucifer,0,Sun Jun 28 14:53:44 2015 UTC,Introducing? LOL. What makes you think there isn't weed in Singapore?

singapore,3b9lyk,natoahs,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:23:29 2015 UTC,"Singaporeans are not ready. Period. As hard as it is to say, the majority of Singaporeans are close minded, and legalization would only serve to sow discord in the community. However, I feel that the penalties for consumption and possession should be more lenient. I mean come on, death sentences for possessing a plant?? I can never understand that to this day. It is Draconian and serves little purpose in the society. End of the day, it is the individual's body, and he has the right to choose what to do with it. If the person has no will to do anything other than blaze all day, he probably wouldn't be a good contributor to society in the first place.  Cannabis is not bad in moderation, I believe Alcohol is so much worse."

singapore,3b9lyk,MatticusjK,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:05:47 2015 UTC,"The benefits of legalization are mostly centred around curbing use in youth, lowering enforcement costs, and promoting educated use. As cannabis use is incredibly low in Singapore, these benefits don't outweigh the cons of legalizing the drug, imo. The issue is different than Colorado, where it has been successul in a place with a very different attitude.  I don't think people should die over it, but I don't think Singapore is in a position where they should legalize"
singapore,3b9lyk,AveLucifer,2,Sat Jun 27 13:00:26 2015 UTC,Medical benefits then?
singapore,3b9lyk,MatticusjK,2,Sat Jun 27 19:02:21 2015 UTC,"I support its medical research, a little sceptical of benefits as we don't have solid evidence of its benefits (but plenty of anecdotal).

John Piper: I know this dad really well, and he has a son who had an injury. And he found, after years of therapy, that the slightest incremental dosage of marijuana that had nothing to do with getting high gave him relief. And it was the only thing that gave him relief in the injured part of his body.   So I think I probably would move in that direction. I would like for those who could get real relief from careful usage ... to have access to it."

singapore,3ba9bb,reddumpling,4,Sat Jun 27 15:54:24 2015 UTC,Second. It's good quality but it's gonna cost.  Same for loakes 1880 or herring. You can try Robinson's. They range from 300-700. It totally depends on what you want.  Full grain leather? (Or genuine leather). When it says genuine leather.  It's actually low quality leather. Full grain is the one you want. There's also corrected grain. which peels after a while at the creases

He always makes simple human errors, and is completely unmotivated to achieve his real potential.  The only health benefit that has been close to 'proven' is as pain management, and there's plenty of other things to use in it's place. The rest of the claims are completely unfounded.  Regarding alcohol, if it were illegal today, there would not be a strong case for legalizing it. The only good reason it is legal is because of the backlash that would occur if it was prohibited.    Alcohol is legal, but do we see it ruining kids lives? No   And, honestly, do you really believe this? Do you really think that alcohol doesn't ruin peoples lives?"
singapore,3b9md5,HansomMan,-2,Sun Jun 28 02:36:45 2015 UTC,"I made a mistake with what I said about it ruining people's lives. I said kids lives, which I'm sure there are some cases where it does ruin their lives too, but it is not common first hand. Of course it ruins adults lives all the time, and those adults often ruin children's lives as a direct result.   As for the proven health benefits, there have been many, such as reduced eye pressure in glaucoma patients, increased spirited and weight gain for cancer, AIDS and HIV patients, and nausea relief.   Those are just the proven studies, not mentioning it's positive effects on multiple sclerosis patients and people with epilepsy.   Further more, THC is not an addictive substance, nor is the rest of the cannabis plant. People have addictive personalities and they stick with it for that reason. Just the same as how it ""makes people"" lazy and unmotivated. That is that person's personality trait, not an effect of the plant.   I myself smoked it heavily in my youth and have have never lost my motivation. Additionally, after about 6 year of continuous use, I quit cold turkey with no issue. I've seen these same situations with many of my ""stoner"" friends. I still know many people that smoke regularly too that are very motivated.   In fact, in other places of there world where it isn't so demonized, you wouldn't believe how many people smoke it regularly. That is often because they are perfectly healthy and motivated people.   It's much healthier than alcohol. The only real negative effects are financial and making you hungry."
singapore,3b9md5,Stanleeallen,3,Sun Jun 28 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"OK think about it from a regulator's POV.   Is the current status quo ok? Yes.  Is there any big advantage or pressure to change the status quo? No.  Will there be any big backlash or possible downsides, however unlikely, whether based on science or perception? Yes.  What do you think the decision will be? I assure you these ministers are briefed thoroughly each time before they make public statements. It's impossible that he does not know ""nothing"" about your fav weed."
singapore,3b9md5,tjhan,0,Sun Jun 28 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"I haven't smoked cannabis personally in almost 10 years, but based on the claims they release publicly, I get the sense that IF they actually pay attention to real scientific and sociological studies from around the world, they are still withholding that information to the public.  The statements that this particular man is making are simply untrue. That is what is making it seem like propaganda, and it IS propaganda. Everybody here should realize that by now. We all know how much the media in Singapore shelters us from the truth.    I'm not trying to sound like a conspiracy theorist here, but when so many other countries have done so much study on the plant, proving its positive effects or almost proving its positive effects, how can our government even think they can manipulate people's opinions and knowledge like that?  Edit: that is what makes it SEEM like they know nothing, when ""respected"" government officials release statements and claims like this."
singapore,3b9md5,Stanleeallen,3,Sun Jun 28 23:57:02 2015 UTC,"Generally, public statements that do not align with one's stand are generally construed as propaganda. If the minister said exactly what you said, the non-drug supporting members of the public would say ""wtf drug propaganda"".  There is no advantage politically or socially for the minister to espouse or champion the merits of marijuana so why should he? In other countries it's up to lobbyists to do so anyway, but we do not have that system and thankfully so."
singapore,3b9md5,tjhan,2,Mon Jun 29 06:57:16 2015 UTC,"Dude, you sound like a pompous millennial. Ganja addiction was a serious menace in Singapore during the 1970s; it took a long time to wipe it out. A huge headache was the close proximity to Aceh, the biggest illicit supplier, & its cultural ties with the Malays across the Straits. If we let the guard down, the decades of improving the community's lives will go down the drain. They went through the misery in real life, & your anonymous bragging doesn't negate that historical fact.  Scientific claims aren't relevant because we're talking about drug addiction here, not drug usage. In other words, the ""demonizing"" is about the social menace, not health menace. If alcohol abuse becomes unacceptable in society, it'll be banned too, & all for the better."
singapore,3b9md5,sjioldboy,0,Sun Jun 28 17:13:58 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I'm an 80's kid, and secondly, I wasn't bragging in the least. I'm sharing my experiences.   That was the 70's. Singapore was hardly even developed then. Look how far it has come now.  People are much more civilized and the society has a much better ow now. I think it's time people are given the chance toile their own decisions regarding a plant that is completely harmless, especially when there are numerous products being sold and consumed that are far worse, such as alcohol, tobacco and sheesha.   There are much more positives of cannabis use than negatives. And scientific proof sure as hell she be in the spotlight within the argument. You don't see the benefit? Helping people through chemotherapy, anxiety, immunodeficiency disorders, epilepsy, depression and more? Wake up. This IS 2015, not the 70's. Times change and so do people.   Look at countries like Canada, USA, Italy, Australia, New Zealand and Spain... They have 10-15% of their population using cannabis yearly. Fully functioning societies, thriving.   The only thing that all countries that outlaw cannabis use have in common as a negative effect is the country's money being spent on incarcerating users. Although I should say money wasted.   Why do you think that so many countries like the USA are pushing for legalization? Do you think they are all missing some secret that only Singapore knows? Or are you saying that the citizens of Singapore can't handle it?  Remember, this is also in the 70's your talking about, when people produced home grown cannabis with low levels of THC. Now people are living in fully functioning societies where high-grade hydroponic cannabis is being grown with high levels of THC, yet they're not on the brink of societal collapse. How is that happening?  What evidence can you bring to the table that cannabis is harmful?  TL;DR: We are not living in 1970's Singapore. We are living in a smoothly functioning, modern, multicultural society that can easily make use of cannabis' benefits, rather than waste money on putting people in prison or wasting their lives by murdering people that traffic a harmless product.    Edit: spelling."

I don't think it's great to ask for help online when it comes to appealing, so what if you know a bit more about the processes? You do not make any actual progress.   Appeals are handled on a case-by-case basis, I doubt people who went through it know what criteria were being sought. Even then, you do realise that an IT course is not only about coding, yes? It's very much about documentation, project management, database design and application, and systems analysis, all of which have little to do with game development courses. You might be able to skip a few courses here and there, but definitely not a year's worth (not to mention that your results are not exactly great)."

If you are at the platform, you see no downward escalator or stairs, then the escalator that starts from the ends and go inwards up is to the top platform. (You are at the bottom most platform.) Therefore, escalators upwards starting from the centre of the platform and going outwards to the sides brings you to the middle platform.   If there is stairs or escalator going down, then you are in the middle level platform. Any escalator going up brings you to the top. It should start from the middle and go up outwards to either side.   Hope it helps. Basically figure out which level platform you are on.

singapore,3b8rqh,denunciator,3,Sat Jun 27 02:28:05 2015 UTC,Don't do it.
singapore,3b8rqh,condor_gyros,5,Sat Jun 27 02:38:35 2015 UTC,"Depends. The best reason for doing it is if you're on track for OCS, don't have any major interests you want to pursue and are able to get a scholarship + fast-tracked. You're looking at COL rank at about 33, I believe, if everything goes right. You'll meet lots of people, learn loads of things about our country (the SAF is involved in a lot of events and homeland security), lead entire units at a really young age. If you perform well enough, you could get groomed for a ministerial or leadership position (like Chan Chun Sing did). Then you're set for life, pretty much.  If you're on track for SCS or if you have any pressing interests you want to pursue, strongly reconsider. Not that being a WOSPEC is bad, of course - some of the most awesome people I've met are WOSPECs - but their lives involve a lot of ground level work, a lot of mixing with men and leading in person. Really demanding and, at least in most (not all) units' cultures, you'll always be second to officers. In contrast, officer work is a lot more about planning, and you're concerned with the running of the unit in terms of 6mo, 1y, 5y frames.  If you're going to be just an enlistee, I'd definitely say no unless you're really passionate about what you're going to be doing - like SOF, ADF, NDU, those are big attractions for people into that stuff. Most of the time though, you won't make it far - you're going to get into the WOSPEC corp eventually but that will take forever and you'll be really far behind your peers. Won't have as much experience, and you're bummed when your contract is up.  Lastly, you could also consider being a DXO after finishing up with uni. Slightly less benefits, a lot less pay but more flexibility and you get to plan your career track instead of having the SAF plan it for you."

Would you like to live a completely unfulfilled life, where you have to book-in to camp 6 days a week, sweat like a pig under your overalls that are entirely inappropriate for this climate, and shake leg while surfing shitty intranet on shitty computers? On the plus side, you can pretend to be a big fuck by ordering teenaged serfs around, while collecting a measly, but stable salary. If you like all those things, you can sign on.  Alternatively, can you survive in the real world? If your answer is no, you can sign on."

singapore,3b9nbe,xbillybobx,11,Sat Jun 27 03:01:32 2015 UTC,Same here. It's becoming a habit to think ahead on which door is closest to the exit escalator on the next station especially during rush hour.    If not in a hurry and if it's underground I enjoy the tunnel views at the front. Feels like a video game.

So when I alight with many others, I would slowly walk to the escalator and by then the escalator would be close to  empty.  Maybe this would help"

singapore,3b9nbe,xbillybobx,3,Sun Jun 28 07:55:02 2015 UTC,Japanese train stations have this board where they tell you which car to use for the exit to where you're going.
singapore,3b9nbe,luacs1998,6,Sat Jun 27 03:06:06 2015 UTC,"Several factors:  1) If the train is empty and the station is empty, then head to the door where the escalator will be when you alight.  2) If the train is empty but the station is very crowded, pick the middle doors of each carriage. Eg for the diagram below, pick 2, 3, 6 or 7. Since they are the middle doors, you can pick the left or right aisle of seats depending on which one has more empty seats.   [1 2 3 4] [5 6 7 8]   3) Train is moderate, platform is crowded. If the station is one of those where there is only one escalator down or up to the train platform, head to the door on the opposite side of the escalator. Less people would be here. If both sides have escalators then head to the middle.  4) Train is completely packed. Head to either end."

singapore,3b9nbe,BabaDuda,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:48:04 2015 UTC,If both sides have escalators then head to the middle.   I still find it amusing that the middle (usually green) section tends to be less packed than the ends of the train.

singapore,3b9nbe,cheekia,4,Sat Jun 27 12:31:28 2015 UTC,I always go to the last carriage... Since most escalators are at the middle of the station... most people bunch up at the middle carriage

If it's a regular trip I take like going to work everyday, I undertake a process-efficiency project where I progressively adjust which door I take each day until my journey is escalator-MRT door-escalator with the minimum steps and acceptable crowd."
singapore,3b9nbe,stoneeus,2,Sat Jun 27 09:50:49 2015 UTC,"If it's crowded, I'll just got for any random door with lesser people.  If it's not crowded, I'll always go for the 7th door for trains going towards Marina Bay or the 7th last door for trains towards JE. Reason being is it's the door closest to the escalator. It varies with different stations though, but that's what I'll do when I'm going home."
singapore,3b9nbe,MachDiamonds,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:16:31 2015 UTC,"But if you choose the cabin that is nearest to the escalator, wouldn't it be the most packed? I mean, people who rush into the train the last minute would definitely go into the cabin which you are in."

I board the first door I see.  2) I'm not late/in a rush, but the train arrives just as I reach the platform. I consider the nearest 3 doors and board the least crowded carriage.  3) I'm not late/in a rush, and I've had enough time to choose which part of the train I want to board (front, end, or middle). I consider the nearest 3 doors of whatever part of the train I want to board, and choose the least crowded carriage. However, if one carriage has that pretty gal I can glance at over and over again while pretending to be busy on my mobile phone, I board it."
singapore,3b9nbe,squeeish,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:47:01 2015 UTC,"Where there are less people. I find that's usually near the front of the train. Not the back. The front is the first car in the direction the train is heading.   Anecdotal experience tip: During peak hours, if you've just waited 3 mins or more for a train to arrive, check if the next train is arriving in 2 minutes. If it is, there is a good chance it'll be significantly less crowded. However, the two minute train also has a higher chance of being an old white train with narrower seats. If you are a buibui like me, this might not be a good thing."

singapore,3b9nbe,DrDolphinrider,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:20:41 2015 UTC,I always choose the third cabin from the front/back. Last cabin is what everyone normally goes to to avoid the squeeze. Many think that this can be resolved by going into the second cabin from the front/back thus it fills up quite fast too so the third one is normally less packed than those I've mentioned. I just avoid the cabins which are easily reached to when I go up from the escalator ..
singapore,3b9nbe,itsRice,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:49:53 2015 UTC,"1) first cabin 2) last cabin 3) middle cabins 3) never, EVER board at the cabin with the escalator coming up during peak hours: CROWD JAM"

singapore,3b9nbe,rainforest_runner,0,Sat Jun 27 05:53:01 2015 UTC,I pick either 2nd last of either end or 1 door AWAY from the escalator/elevator because the one closest gets bumrushed by people rushing in.

(Avoid) is there a smelly person (avoid) avoid schoolboys/girls: these fuckers have some sports activity, don't shower and smell is there an old man picking his nose and coughing (avoid) is there some eye candy (bonus)   That's about it I think."
