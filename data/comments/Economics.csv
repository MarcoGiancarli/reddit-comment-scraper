It's not some gimmick, it's exactly what ordering a ride should be like and it did not exist before, and drivers can literally opt out anytime. They don't even need to give more than a couple rides a month, as I understand. Why shouldn't there be a platform where I can essentially rent out my passenger seats? That strikes me as empowering.

Then people will decide that they dont really want a million uber drivers clogging the roads so they will come up with a new idea to keep a useful but not overwhelming number of tax... er, uber drivers on the road. Hmmm, perhaps some kind of license or... I KNOW WE CAN CALL THEM MEDALLIONS! Thats a great idea. We can have the cities that the tax.. uber drivers operate in auction them off and use the money for roads and stuff.    But hey TECH COMPANY!!! WOOHOO.

Should the average person really care whether pizza delivery drivers end up making less when a superior company comes along and starts delivering lower priced, fresher tasting pizza? Of course not. But somehow not being paid a ""living wage"" to transport people is some type of travesty and injustice. Especially when you consider that many Uber drivers, drive part time, and they are thankful for it, it represents extra income,  putting that newer car that just sits in the garage 90% of the time to productive use."

I have several friends who make twice that much working half as long. They drive on the weekends to supplement their day jobs.   It should be obvious too considering the breakdown of immigrant to American drivers. It's totally illogical to imagine an immigrant heavy industry being less exploitative than an American heavy competitor.
Economics,3dz22g,danny841,2,Mon Jul 20 20:56:17 2015 UTC,I think taxis also just pickup less people in general. If you a taxi driver takes someone from the airport to their hotel they have to drive all the way back to the airport to find a new fare and keep driving back and forth all day. An Uber driver can work any high traffic area and immediately jump into the area where their fare is going. No backtracking required.

Economics,3dz22g,eo10998,17,Mon Jul 20 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"Uber/Lyft hire drivers via independent contractor-ship. This means drivers provide their own vehicles and phone, and Uber/Lyft essentially offload risk/high capital requirements on drivers. They also don't pay fees related to taxi licensing etc.  Whether or not these are OK or bad things will find different opinions from different people, but essentially this is what makes these companies viable (for now)."
Economics,3dz22g,potato1,8,Mon Jul 20 19:43:12 2015 UTC,One could argue that the fees aren't productive and are more of a barrier to entry put in place by a cartel.

They are meant to protect consumers, whether it be environmental, safety, or other issues. If they don't work, then we need to address. OP's point was duh its cheaper, they don't have to pay for X, which is valid. Whether or not they should be is a different issue"
Economics,3dz22g,potato1,8,Mon Jul 20 20:32:04 2015 UTC,"It's not necessarily true of all licensing and fees if they actually fix an externality problem or provide value in ensuring service quality or something (like a restaurant health inspection, for instance). Uber's high service quality is generally indicative that taxi medallions aren't effective."
Economics,3dz22g,eo10998,2,Mon Jul 20 20:41:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, very true. I was hinting more towards the issue of licensing and fees isn't black and white. It's more of an ""overall opinion"" when it comes to their effectiveness. Most would agree that health codes are necessary, while some environmental requirements are superfluous. Eye of the beholder type of deal.  That being said, I think that Uber/Lyft's service is great. Some theorize that the initial drivers for these companies were from a certain demographic which was less prone to crime, but as with most large companies, the type of worker they attract changes. Hopefully Uber and Lyft's driver screening practices remain up to par, but many people would argue that there should be some sort of standard - how that is implemented is another issue"

An externality should be affecting someone, either negatively or positively, whom was not involved in the decision-making process.  Taxi medallions MAY be thought of as potentially fixing the externality of congestion in city roads.  I don't agree with this, but this is the only externality in terms of Uber that I can imagine."
Economics,3dz22g,HunterHearstHemsley,9,Mon Jul 20 20:41:00 2015 UTC,"I've talked with a few uber drivers about this. Apparently Uber is focusing heavily on recruiting new drivers then keeping new ones. Fares have been going down which cuts into the drivers pay. Essentially, Uber would rather have a bunch of part time drives that work for a couple of hours a week for 6-months than drivers who are committed for the long-term.   So it's not at the point where fares are low enough to keep drivers away, but they might be low enough to keep drivers from staying."

Economics,3dz22g,SilasX,2,Tue Jul 21 01:05:59 2015 UTC,"IMHO, the logic for limiting medallions makes sense on economic grounds, but only for vehicles that look for and pick up street hails by sight. This causes congestion above and beyond what an ordinary driver on the road would cause, when drivers have to clog the major streets looking for hails.   But there's no similar congestion for a pre-arranged service, where drivers don't vie ""shoulder to shoulder"" for people hailing them. In that case, they only go where requested and otherwise don't have to crowd the popular areas.  So it makes sense from a policy standpoint to only apply the limo limit to those taking street hails."

Uber relies on naive drivers' perception that driving is basically free after gas. Once you figure out how little you're making, you drop out as fast as you can, but at that point Uber's signed up two new guys to take your place. They use highly exploitative, pyramid scheme style recruiting, and it's not honest to present the situation as one of symmetric information."

Economics,3dz22g,Plopdopdoop,3,Tue Jul 21 11:33:08 2015 UTC,"This study comparing prices is disingenuous worth little when Uber's are artificially--but temporarily--lower. I mean, haven't they admitted their strategy is in essence a predatory pricing model--setting prices below cost until smaller competitors have been driven out?  As a user I admit I use Uber because they are far cheaper (amongst other reasons). But no one really thinks these low prices prices will last, do they? When their temporary price cuts happen--and they seem to happen an awful lot--they're still paying their drivers the original price. That's not sustainable.  Relevant articles, if a little old:  UBER JUST CUT PRICES IN DALLAS AGAIN, BUT DON'T EXPECT IT TO LAST  Uber Is Now Losing Money On Every UberX Ride  Edit: To the replies mentioning basic economic theory, that's of course understood (and assumed). My comment pertains to the study referenced here. The headline lists price as one of two differentiating factors. My point is that lower price--and by necessity lower cost--isn't a natural or inbuilt feature of the product. As opposed to speed, scheduling, and other informationally driven advantages Uber legitimately has.   Uber hasn't fundamentally changed anything about the total business cost of taxi service. What they have been successful at is distributing some of the traditional industry costs to other parties: driver insurance (Uber's driver insurance isn't primary), maintenance, etc. But I argue that's only temporary; those costs will gradually be pushed back on them as issues like contractor (vs employee) designations, liability, and others are decided against Uber. They then may still be left with some cost savings because of technology and scale. But those are only marginal minor.    Now, if they succeed in a long term plan to switch to driverless cars then they'll truly be able to reduce cost.  To summarize:   Much of Uber's price advantage is due to significantly below cost rates, subsidized with their huge war chest of funding   That situation is temporary, by necessity  Some price advantage is due to lower cost of service by successfully having distributed traditional industry costs to other (less sophisticated) parties   That distribution of costs is, too, largely temporary"

Economics,3e2jlt,bahhumbugger,12,Tue Jul 21 13:57:45 2015 UTC,"A few remarks: Many people (here and elsewhere) like to repeat how obvious it was that the euro was a bad idea. A recurrent complaint is how EU politicians and economists could fail to see its obvious flaws. This betrays great ignorance of the history of the euro pre-1999 (beginning of Stage 3 of the EMU). The supporters of the euro may turn out to have been wrong, but to suggest that there was a clear consensus is simply incorrect.  All the obvious, and many more, less obvious, qualitative arguments for and against the euro that you read over and over were widely studied and debated long before Stage 3. For an example of a US-based economist addressing the question of the supposed need for fiscal integration (which seems to now be accepted by the US press as an obvious, unconditional imperative for monetary union), see Eichengreen in European Monetary Unification, Ch. 9. This was based on Eichengreen and Hagen, 1996.   Which brings me to the next point. Without quantitative information or at least estimates, how could you possibly tell whether things like attachment to nationalist ideas and language barriers will be minor problems, or on the contrary are sufficient to dampen economic mobility to the point where it is a problem? It is obvious that language will make a difference, but it is far from obvious how much of a difference it makes.   If it is ""obvious"" to you that the euro could not work because of language barriers, ask yourself this: if someone in 1992 told you they didn't believe the language barrier would prevent Spaniards from moving to Germany for jobs, because low-skill jobs require only limited language proficiency, and highly-educated workers in Europe are largely multilingual, would you really be able to give a better response than ""I still don't think the Maastricht legal framework will be enough to ensure sufficient mobility""?  All these questions were addressed in the long and rich debate among economists on the EMU starting in the 1980s. Neither side provided truly conclusive arguments. Presenting the euro as a purely political project that was rammed through without consideration for basic economic objections a five year old would understand is extremely misleading.   For a more serious (albeit already seriously outdated) review of negative opinions on the currency union before Maastricht, see this."

Re-reading European Monetary Unification (essentially a collation of his papers on EMU from the late 80s to 1997) 20 years later is very interesting.   Even in ""hard"" sciences like physics, culture and affiliation play some role in the acceptance of new ideas and where experts stand on current controversies. Where professional economists stood on the euro was most certainly influenced by their views on the European project as a whole.   My main point was that the simple objections you read every day now were well-known to everybody, and that, after perusing the 1980-Maastricht literature (even those papers and opinions written by Euro-sceptics), it is far from clear how important each of these objections were."

And in this case it was a very valid suspicion too and I for one is glad that the no side won. Also, I think it helped that a lot of prominent economists could give real facts and a voice to the sneaky suspicion that more EU isn't always good.   But with regional currencies one would need five central banks, the USD would immediately loose its status and the richer regions would fight hard as hell not to transfer money not to mention that the Federal government would lose power.

By the time of unification on January 1, 1999, long-term yields in all four countries lay between 3.9% and 4.2%, a drop of over 8 percentage points for Italy and Spain. To get a feel for the size of this move, imagine 30-year mortgage rates falling by 8 percentage points! By contrast, long-term interest rates in the U.S. fell only 3 percentage points (from 8% to 5%) over the same period."

Blinder's Rule: ""The more economists agree on an issue the more they are ignored"".  The euro was one example, from Friedman to Krugman the whole range of economists said ""Don't!"" and the politicians just ignored them.   But there are a plethora of other examples: ""Emergency WWII NYC rent controls"" now running 70+ years and just extended again, all economists sounding in on the subject over the decades and again this past year utterly ignored.  The list is endless...  The illusion that economists have significant influence comes from the fact that when politicians fight over something and economists actually do disagree about it, the political rivals invoke and publicize selected economists as authorities for their own sides.  (Blinder's Rule again, the economists don't agree so now they become authorities.)  But this is economists being used by politicians, not influencing them.  There's an excellent little book quoting various famous economists on this subject, What Do Economists Contribute?  (Out of print now, but should be in libraries and perhaps online.)  E.g., Stigler said economists should totally forget influencing policy, and just do good work and wait for the world at large to learn.  Coase disagreed, saying economists have some marginal influence no matter how small it may be -- and if they improve government policy by just 1%, in comparison to all their total combined salaries that's a huge payoff for society.   Tullock said academic departments should require econ faculty and grad students to publish plain-English articles in mass market magazines and newspapers to educate the public to economic thinking as part of their publish-or-perish requirements, and so on.  But really, bottom line, economists have much, much less influence on policy than all the arguments in this subreddit typically assume."

We first present a model in which differences in human capital investments emerge as an equilibrium outcome of private decisions and government policy choices. We then illustrate these dynamics in two historical circumstances. In medieval Europe, states and the Church found individuals trained in Roman law valuable, and eventually supported productive investments in this new form of human capital. In late 19th-century China, elites were threatened by the introduction of Western science and engineering and continued to select civil servants—who enjoyed substantial rents—based on their knowledge of the Confucian classics; as a result, investments in productive, modern human capital were not made"

It's definitely the fixed exchange rate regime that benefits Germany, though it's not clear the distinction Sumner is trying to make between that and ""the euro itself"" as the euro is an example of a fixed rate regime. Also, europe did try a version of fixed exchange rate, a ""soft peg"" which fell apart a few years prior to the adoption of the euro for the same basic reasons the euro is currently in crisis.  As to how Germany has benefited from it, exhibit A:  German current account balance 1990 - present.   The CA surplus is simply domestic saving minus domestic investment; it’s not clear why we should care about it.   A CA surplus accumulates as savings. On the other side of the ledger, that CA surplus is a CA deficit for trading partners and that CA deficit accumulates as debt.

It doesn't tell us which of those things is happening, only that some combination of them must be true. It means the CA doesn't exist in a vacuum and directly relates to the rest of the economy. We have to care because a change in one place implies an offsetting change somewhere else.  Or to rephrase the same idea in sectoral balance terms...  NX = (G - T) + (S - I) (USA example here, blue = foreign, red = govt, green = domestic private, black = govt + domestic pvt)  ...where it's clear that none of the three sectors, govt, domestic private, or foreign can be ignored. Nor is it economically coherent to talk about targeting a change in any one of them without also explaining what you expect to happen in the others.  Unfortunately all those things are commonplace.

In all of the scenarios that I consider, a substantial portion of the intended transfer to low income single mothers is captured by employers through reduced wages. The transfer to employers is borne in part by low skill workers who are not themselves eligible for the EITC and are therefore made strictly worse off by its existence. I contrast the EITC with a traditional Negative Income Tax (NIT). The NIT discourages work, and so induces large transfers from employers of low skill labor to their workers. With my preferred parameters the EITC increases after-tax incomes by $0.73 per dollar spent, while the NIT yields $1.39."

Your point is a valid one, and amenable to me from a policy perspective, but it doesn't address the point of the counter argument, that the cost of the benefit (in the no-bundle situation) is being paid by someone removed from the transaction - the high wage tax payers.

It's the combination of the reduced margin and reduced customers which would hurt Wal-Mart. There doesn't need to be a big variation, since Wal-Mart's biggest component to their low cost is their huge scale and, thus, bargaining power.

This is a very clear line, and easy to see, and not at all exaggerated.  My point was that, when people say that taxes are subsidizing Wal-Mart, in fact, they are subsiding the low-price retailer, and this includes Wal-Mart and other retailers, but also McDonald's and other fast food, low-margin, low-price restaurants, and many others like them.   This has a multiplier effect. It keeps people working for a wage, plus the benefits they get from the government, plus it keeps their living affordable by providing goods and services that are affordable to them. By raising benefits, at least some of them would lose jobs and all of them would lose affordability. Raising benefits is a lose-lose in this situation (italics for emphasis).

Economics,3dxpjd,Slaves2Darkness,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:06:13 2015 UTC,"For a ""Happy Meal"" analogy to work well, there are a number of things lacking.  Employer monopsony - there are only a certain number of job openings for a particular skill set in an area at any given point in time.  There are more if the employee is mobile, but that increases the transaction cost.  You might only have 5-10 ""restaurants"" near you, so your options are limited to what those places are selling - whether value meals or a la carte.  If there's insufficient competition, then the employers have a lot of negotiating power here.  Tax advantages of Employer Healthcare and group plan discounts - since in the US, employer contributions to health insurance are pre-tax and insurance companies often offer lower rates to group policies, an employer can offer a service for a much lower price than the employee could buy it for.  That allows the employer arbitrage, capturing most if the economic advantage of their position.  Analogical McDonalds can sell their Hamburger for $4 and their Value Meal for $6 knowing that the Fry Shack and the Coke Machines in the area each cost $1.25, despite the Frys and Cokes only costing McDonalds $.50 each.  People who would like contract labor aren't getting compensated enough extra to make up for their reduced wages.  Job Security/Unemployment Benefits - Despite many states becoming at-will employment states, unless a termination is for some documented reason of misconduct, an employee is eligible for unemployment benefits.  A contractor is subject to no such conditions when their contract is up.  There is no good way to demonstrate this ""stickyness"" in the Value Meal fallacy for either the employer or the employee.  Social Benefits - Despite a restaurant not offering a soda with their value meal, their customers clearly will need to drink SOMETHING, so they all start patronizing the water fountain outside that is funded by everyones' taxes.  This turns into a free-loader problem whereby the customers and restaurants that do provide beverages are having to help fund the water fountain that was meant for those who can't afford a beverage, but is instead being used by customers of cheapskate restaurant.    All of these are benefits of employment that are not easily captured by the addition of additional ""side items"" on the menu."

Economics,3dxpjd,besttrousers,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:42:17 2015 UTC,"I think leaving out monopsony characteristics does weaken the efficacy of this supposed fallacy. The laid out assumption is that people are offered a burger and a combo, and are freely given the choice between the two. This clearly isn't the case. Partial monopsony power can allow the employer to limit choices of the employee's compensation.   If firms are required to provide benefits to contractors they will lower the contractor wage. But how do we know the extra benefits aren’t worth the reduction in wages? If the extra benefits were worth more to workers than they cost firms, firms would have eagerly provided these benefits as a way of increasing profits. Firms can profit whenever buyers are willing to pay more for a product than its cost. Benefits are a product that workers buy from firms. Workers buy benefits from firms by offering to work at a lower wage. Firms are happy to sell benefits when workers will accept a wage reduction that covers the cost of the benefit. Thus, if workers value a benefit by more than its cost, there is a mutually profitable deal to be made. The firm will provide the benefit and wages will fall by more than the cost but by less than the value of the benefit. Both firms and workers will be better off. It’s implausible that firms and workers will overlook mutually profitable exchanges. Thus requiring firms to provide benefits with every job means requiring firms to sell benefits that workers value less than their cost and that makes both firms and workers worse off–just like requiring restaurants to sell burgers with fries and a drink makes firms and customers worse off.   This part screams, ""let's just ignore monopsony influence!"" It's the same stuff we see with (near) minimum wage stickiness that's laid out here.  Also, you've gone from arguing for the fallacy as a whole and into arguing the obvious point of wages are substituted by compensation and pretending that some of these people are arguing on the same level."
Economics,3dxpjd,aksfjh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:53:24 2015 UTC,Partial monopsony power can allow the employer to limit choices of the employee's compensation.   How? I don't see any mechanism by which this would be true.  Monopsony allows a firm to set a workers total compensation to be below that individual MPL. I don't know of any reason to think it would have a different effect on how that compensation is allocated between wage and benefits.
Economics,3dxpjd,besttrousers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:19:46 2015 UTC,"The argument that monopsony can affect wages essentially boils down to their power to affect how employment contracts are drafted. In the most simple terms, they control compensation, but it can be expanded to include schedules and compensation composition. The idea being that they can control the supply of employees available to them through the details of the contract. They don't have to raise compensation or provide benefits (in lieu of wages) in order to get their minimum required utility from employees. They don't have to offer compensation options because there is no competitive alternative. It's a very ""take it or leave it"" arrangement."
Economics,3dxpjd,aksfjh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:09:28 2015 UTC,"The argument that monopsony can affect wages essentially boils down to their power to affect how employment contracts are drafted.   No, the argument about how monopsony effect wages has to do with how demand and supply curves interact to form price and quantity. It only would change total compensation; there's no reason to expect that it would change allocation.  If that's not true, I want to see the actual mathematics underlying it! Because it certainly isn't coming out of a monopsonistic S+D curve."
Economics,3dxpjd,besttrousers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:07:40 2015 UTC,A monopsonistic S+D curve is a model that describes the motivations behind the game theory scenario in which one party has an overwhelming advantage while drawing up a contract. It provides a useful answer to the question of how a monopsonistic (or monopolistic) relationship can arrive at a non-arbitrary price point. Here is a law paper on the subject at hand outside of the economic model and more in line with the game theory side of it. It even has a section on non-price terms (aka schedules and benefits in labor markets).
Economics,3dxpjd,aksfjh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:49:36 2015 UTC,"This doesn't change how compensation would be determined between wages and benefits. Firms will still set MC=MB; you're still reducing wages when you mandate benefits.   No, firms set MC <= MB.  Given that employers will want to optimize their costs, they will want to pay the least amount they can.   If employers are underutilizing these tax advantages, why? Why would they need to have it mandated?   The tax advantages are for the employees, not the employers.   How does this effect the wage differential arguments?   It means that the difference between an employee position or a contractor position are qualitatively different.  The difference is not just how many side items are included on the meal, but a promise of meals beyond the first.  It's the difference between an individual transaction of money for burger and a McDonalds Membership Plan where you join their club, and you get a value meal at a set price, and even if they drop you from their membership plan, they will sell you value meals at 120% of that price for a period of time.  It makes employment vs contract labor qualitatively different rather than simply this is the contract price in cash, and this is the contract price in cash + benefits.   What are the externalities or public goods you are thinking about here?   Health insurance subsidies, housing assistance, food stamps, EITC, Medicaid, mandatory ER treatment."

Economics,3dxpjd,lua_x_ia,4,Mon Jul 20 14:32:17 2015 UTC,"Sure. You see, the problem with the word ""benefits"" is that it's fungible, it doesn't describe anything, but really the only ""benefits"" with any significant price tag attached that anyone talks about mandating are healthcare and time off.   Suppose we're looking at an oil rig in Louisiana. This is all made-up and I don't know much about oil rigs, but the story takes place before the introduction of DDT.  Most of the workers at the rig work during the day and make X dollars. But some of the workers show up in the evening and make 1.5X dollars. In a number of cases someone who works during the day will switch to working evenings because of financial problems, personal competitiveness, et cetera.   Unfortunately the mosquitoes in the swamp show up during the evening and people who work evenings are six times as likely to get malaria as people who work in the daytime. So now you have a situation where people occasionally end up in some dire financial situation, start working evenings, and die of malaria.  Do you ban working in the evening? Why or why not?  If you change the variables to healthcare and social and mental health, you start to see why these sort of laws hold water. Is it offensive to people's personal freedom -- even paternalistic -- to ban them from taking personal risks for money? It absolutely is, and I think we should try to avoid it as much as possible. But as a pure economic question, protecting human capital from damage can be an important component of any long-term strategy, methinks. And the truth is, anyone stuck in that situation probably doesn't really feel like they have a whole lot of freedom anyway, so it doesn't matter quite as much exactly whose shit sandwich they're eating, anyway."

Economics,3dxpjd,lua_x_ia,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:26 2015 UTC,"Right, but now we're talking about something else: the ideological foundation of an idea versus its likely economic consequences. The mechanistic idea makes sense but thinking like that has led to very bad governance historically; the populist idea seems wrong but it's applied in plenty of successful economies (Western Europe, the Commonwealth, the Arabian Peninsula) and it's nowhere near as bad as, say, trade protectionism (Latin America). There's a reason, I guess, that we examine things differently based on who we're talking to and how near we are to a subject.  The long-term goal is people's quality of life. We can't ever imagine the whole process so we get used to doing things that seem to be associated with harmony.  EDIT: For the record, I chose to say ""protect human capital from damage"" deliberately in order to sound as coldhearted and value-free as I could. Obviously that's a pretty nihilistic way of thinking."
Economics,3dxpjd,mccoyn,11,Mon Jul 20 19:11:05 2015 UTC,"One issue, not included in the happy meal fallacy is that when the supply of available workers is high and demand for them is low, a potential worker has decreased negotiating power.  The employer will likely only accept an option that benefits them even if it does not benefit the worker.  A regulation can attempt to rebalance this by forbidding the unfair option."
Economics,3dxpjd,Lazyleader,30,Mon Jul 20 20:24:32 2015 UTC,"Your first sentence is just a description of supply and demand and applies to everything, not just workers. Then you say that there is a downward trend for wages because of a higher supply of workers. Your solution is that the government can increase the cost of workers by mandating health insurance. Not only does the government completely ignore the individual situation the worker is in, which means it applies to high demand workers as much as low demand workers, it reduces the demand of said workers even further in artificially increasing the cost of them."
Economics,3dxpjd,Zifnab25,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:05:20 2015 UTC,"If a worker yields $20/hr in labor, the employer can pay up to $20/hr in wages.  Increasing the supply of workers might dilute individual bargaining power, but it doesn't change the yield a given worker produces (as that's more tightly tied to efficiency of business capital at low-skill job levels).  A population of low-skill workers therefore has an incentive to negotiate with the employer collectively, as any single worker - when pitted against all other workers of his skill level - will be at a disadvantage.  The smaller employer hiring pool has a functional monopsony on labor relative to the higher-population worker pool.  Employers aren't going to hire fewer workers.  One way to negotiate collectively is to unionize.  Unfortunately, unionization is a difficult legal maneuver and leaves individual workers advocating for unionization exposed to blacklisting and other discriminatory hiring practices.  Another way to negotiate collectively is to support legislation at the municipal, state, or federal level.  This negotiation is more powerful as it makes higher wages contingent on access to a real estate area rather than a labor pool.  And it's more difficult to pin down advocates and blacklist them when they are advocating reforms through secret ballot across a population than advocating a straight vote exclusively among company employees.  Each useful worker yields $20/hr.  Unuseful workers yield $0/hr.  So changing the negotiated wage rate (as long as it stays below the $20/hr mark) doesn't influence the demand for labor.  But negotiating a higher salary across a general population does significantly improve quality of life among that population."
Economics,3dxpjd,Lazyleader,15,Mon Jul 20 15:30:35 2015 UTC,"Each useful worker yields $20/hr. So changing the negotiated wage rate (as long as it stays below the $20/hr mark)   But that's my point. You are arguing for something like a union that looks at what the worker could be paid without the company going broke and advocates to pay them that amount.  Mandatory benefits add a fixed cost on all wages no matter how small the gap between ""worker yield"" and wage is. It even applies to companies that already pay more than what they receive. If all companies had a gap between worker yield and wages no company would ever go insolvent. But they do because like some of them pay too little others pay too much. Mandatory benefits do not address the gap at all."
Economics,3dxpjd,KhabaLox,3,Mon Jul 20 16:23:12 2015 UTC,"So changing the negotiated wage rate (as long as it stays below the $20/hr mark)   I agree with everything you've said, but it should be highlighted that this clause is very difficult to achieve.  For example, minimum wage regulations apply to all jobs, which all have different productivity values.  Not to mention, there is productivity variance among the set of minimum wage employees."
Economics,3dxpjd,Zifnab25,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:35:28 2015 UTC,"I believe there's something of a ""natural"" minimum wage.  There's a wage below which people simply won't work, because working is more expensive than not working.  If you're paying me $.01/hr, I can earn more doing a host of other things - from panhandling to dumpster diving to subsistence farming on squatted land - such that you'll never entice me to work for that wage.  For many jobs, this ""natural"" minimum exceeds the legal minimum.  If it costs you $30k/year to live in New York, you can't work a 40 hour week at $10/hr.  The numbers don't crunch.  So the increase in minimum wage isn't going to hit everyone equally.  In many locations, the increase has already been accounted for.  Past that, there is an assumption that as wages rise you can see the cost-pie shift.  If you operate a retail outlet in a strip mall and 20% of your revenue goes to renting the location while 10% goes to payroll, an increase in payroll doesn't necessarily put you out of business.  The business owner can always turn to the landlord and say ""We need you to cut our rent in half or you'll lose our business"".  And, if costs go up across the board, the landlord will be more likely to agree given that he is less likely to find a replacement.  Likewise, you could see prices increase proportionally.  So there could be a 10% bump in retail sales prices in order to cover a 100% increase in wages.  Or a 5% increase in prices and a 25% decrease in rent.  Or whatever mix is appropriate.  So there's a lot of ways the cost of a min-wage increase could be absorbed.  It's not simply ""Fire half the staff or go out of business"".  Wages aren't the only place where costs fluctuate in a business environment, and good business owners are well-equipped to adjust their strategies accordingly."
Economics,3dxpjd,KhabaLox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"So there's a lot of ways the cost of a min-wage increase could be absorbed.   Absolutely.  I was just pointing out that a min wage regulation that requires the min wage to be below (but close to) worker productivity is hard to achieve in reality because of it applies across regions, employees and industries which all have different costs/productivities.  By it's nature, it's a blunt tool, and has to be pegged to the least productive worker."

Second supply and demand are not things we impose on others, they exist whether we acknowledge their existence or not. Because of that fact the increase in labor cost through benefits has a negative impact on wages.

Workers aren't typically factoring in the cost of moving to find new employment in their negotiation of current wages.  In fact, there are a host of risks and one-off costs that workers fail to factor into wage math, simply because the body of potential employees lack the education and long-term planning skills to account for them.  It's one of the reason we  have social insurance programs - Medicare, Social Security, UI, etc.  Individuals have proven empirically to engage as a community in poor long-term risk mitigation practices.  When a minority attempts to embrace long-term best-practices, they find themselves unable to compete with the majority that are willing to sacrifice long term health and stability for short term poverty relief.

Benefits are a transaction between employer and employee and are offered to attract great candidates, to improve morale, to keep turnover low, and to improve productivity.  Value meals are a transaction between consumer and seller to incentivize spending more money at their establishment.  The suggestion behind this ""happy meal fallacy"" is that employers that are forced to offer a certain standard of benefits will also be forced to reduce salaries, but there is no evidence to support that aside from other bad analogies. The cost of benefits can fit well within most companies ability to offer competitive salaries, so if my competitor offers $50k with benefits and I offer $60k with none, then I mostly am just hoping 1. that my competitor won't just match my offer and include benefits on top, and 2. That the value of those benefits isn't greater than the difference for this candidate.

First I will say the whole premise of this article is false, because very few people actually get to decide whether to be contractors or employees. I personally like being a contractor, but I can see how it would be hard for someone with less income and a family to support.  Benefits: I pay far less in taxes because of the way s-corps work and my ability to deduct expenses, but this wouldn't be the case for everyone.  I also can demand a higher wage because it is easier to shop around for who pays best.  Plus I can take on jobs on a temporary basis without quitting my current job.  Cons: Lack of access to credit.  I can't even get a mortgage right now despite a great credit rating, good income and large savings.  Banks require you have at least two years of 1099 income before lending, so until next year I can't get a mortgage. Also, no health insurance. I buy my own, which as a young single person is cheap, but this is really hurting some of my coworkers with families.  Don't care about the 401k.  Overall I like being a contractor. However, if you are lower income, you really can't take advantage of the tax savings an s-corp affords.  Plus you can't afford a good accountant.  I'd complain about lack of health insurance, but most jobs on the lower income spectrum don't offer it anyway.

Those that benefit least from this compensation are those that already have them or have little need for them, people who are doing alright already. The benefits are redundant or unnecessary, so the wages lost to this arrangement are just that.   What's odd about him bringing up the poor in this at all, he's aware of the minimum wage statistic that states that most of those working minimum wage are part of households out of poverty. That seems to contradict the view that marginally higher contractor wages would somehow benefit the poor any more than an increase in minimum wage would."

Its not clear how mandating that someone receive employee benefits will actually help them more accurately calculate these long term costs. And regulators are victims to the same mental barriers as normal human beings, so if the regulator creating this rule fails to calculate long term costs in some way then you have just magnified the problem you set out to fix.  Underpaying for non-monetary benefits is much more solvable than overpaying for non-monetary benefits.

I don't think it's fair to tie that to helping the poor as well, or to say that forcing ""fries and a drink"" on everybody is an outright loss for workers and firms.   If there were economies of scale to be realized, the employers would realize them in the absence of a mandate to provide those goods.   Also, with some of the things we know about firm behavior in regards to wages/benefits, we know this to be false as well.

It doesn't matter in cases where the worker doesn't want the benefit. Going back to the happy meal analogy. Imagine you don't want fries at all. The price of a burger has gone up $1 to cover the cost of the fries. Without everyone getting fries, the cost of adding fries would be $1.50.

Economics,3dxpjd,dHoser,2,Mon Jul 20 14:41:00 2015 UTC,"Not really the same at all. Auto insurance is paying in advance for any potential negative externalities you might cause. So no, asking people to voluntarily pay for their negative externalities is a bad idea. Get them to pay up front.  Job benefits aren't a negative externality. You could have maybe made an argument for healthcare costs being offloaded onto others, but the US has mandatory health insurance now, so that argument no longer works.  The choice here is whether workers want more cash or want more in kind benefits. Its a terrible idea to mandate that all workers must have one thing. Each person's needs are different and they should be able to decide for themselves what they want. They don't need a bunch of amateur paternalists/economists telling them that they have to select the 'less cash' option."

The first option can be plugged into a progressive tax system, the second option is highly regressive (since young people tend to be poorer).  How is it a fallacy? Maybe it would help if its in different terms. Imagine a cable company is offering you a bunch of bundled items like tv, internet, and phone service. Each service costs $50 on their own, or you can get the whole bundle for $100. Lets pretend you don't want tv or phone service.

How is it a fallacy?   Well, the argument is known as the ""Happy Meal Fallacy"" - it's not me calling the argument fallacious, though I don't support it. Being someone who uses the Happy Meal Fallacy (or your cable bill example) is to broad brush all bundling as negative."

You don't speak for the poor, even if you are poor or know plenty of poor people. They are not a single entity, so a single solution isn't guaranteed to help.  Even assuming you are some magical voice for the poor, and they all need security for various things in life. Employee benefits often aren't an a-la-carte selection. They are a package deal. You could easily have a situation where an employee needs security from problem x, and that security costs $50 outside of the job. The job secures him against problems x, y, and z for $100 less in wages. He didn't need security for y and z. So this is just like the happy meal problem above where they are paying $50 for something they don't want rather than $0 for something they don't want.  More money can always be used to solve an unforeseen problem. More in kind benefits increase your protection from known potential problems, and decrease your protection from unforeseen problems (because you have less money). By forcing employees to take a certain package of benefits that will protect them against some problems, you do not make them more secure. Its a tossup, and probably heavily dependent on the specific circumstances for each person. Which is why a market solution makes way more sense. Let people figure out what works for them, and stop assuming you know their situation better than they do."

This is actually a complicated problem. Consider the following. I live in a country where per law shops are closed on sunday. This is to allow workers (the main breadwinner types) to spend half a weekend with their families. It is true that without the law they could not choose or prefer to do so because from the angle of main breadwinners they need as much income as possible and they don't have much negotiation power. They must take whatever schedule their employer gives them and this is bad. However there were people e.g. college students who actually preferred working on sundays, seriously did as they had no classes on sundays. So for them this regulation is not so  good, when jobs are regulated to 9 to 18 Mo-Sat, college student workers will obviously suffer.  So this is a huge dilemma how to have regulation that protects the main breadwinners, yet allows flexibility for part-time working moms, college students, people who have different preferences.

Bear in mind that the entire concept of worker benefits came out of the post-war boom when it was referred to as ""fringe"" benefits - a way to attract the best talent in a workforce glutted with returning veterans and the winding down war industry, as well as an economy transitioning from rural/agricultural to suburban/commuter on the way to post-industrial.   Offering things like health insurance or retirement benefits through employers rather than ""on the market"" was seen as a win-win-win - employers got the best talent and their health was protected, employees got benefits without having to manage for themselves, and health insurers as example would benefit from lower admin costs in selling to large groups, community rating, etc. That's why we saw the establishment of laws around making many of these benefits tax-advantaged for the employer - tipping the scales in favor of this arrangement.  The entire thrust of this article is around the ""gig"" economy, which may be a reality for some (tech workers in large cities, designers, developers, single young professionals and ""change agents"", etc) but regular full time employment is certainly still a reality for most, especially those who are householders and have families.   Anyways, the subtext of this article seems to be around mandated healthcare coverage, which is a hell of a lot different from fries with your happy meal. The fact remains that the best way to pay for all of the needs of healthcare (trained professionals, facilities, technology, pharmaceuticals) is through prepaid universal coverage, whether single or multiple payer. (what we refer to as ""insurance"").   A staffed hospital emergency room doesn't spring into existence when a ""gig"" worker needs it, and imagining it as interchangeable with a French fry or an iphone or other fungible consumer good is ignorant."

Stagnant wages for the last several decades in much of the west demonstrate the impact of labor cost containment initiatives.   -Where there is a surplus of labor, individuals compete not only on their ability to produce, but by their ability to accept less than the competition.

They told him they couldn't pay him any more since he didn't have a degree (even though he was obviously capable of doing the job).  There was no opportunity for advancement.  It was solely to save the company money.  He received a job offer shortly after for $60,000/yr, and they wouldn't match it, so he left.

I don't see it as more critical than the employees actually doing the work, but I do recognize the importance of a figurehead and agree they play a significant role in a company's success.  My problem is mostly with the low tax rates on capital gains.  Yes, shareholders need to have a reason to invest their money, but it's gotten to the point where it's at the expense of the workers and the nation.  For example, Bezos recently made $30B in an incredibly short span.  I realize it's not that simple, and that he helped grow the company, but so did all the workers.  Also, does anyone really need that much money?  I'm even fine with keeping taxes on capital gains low until they reach a certain amount, just like the EITC.

But the changes wouldn’t exert any meaningful upward pressure on wages, they concluded.   What happened to the law of ""supply and demand""? 120,000 less unemployed on the streets = less competition for more jobs = higher salaries. And we are talking about managerial positions that require some decent skills, so that reduction in unemployment for eligible people can be quite big."

Unemployment is actually low.  u3=5.3% The difference between u3 and u6 is a little bit higher than one would expect given the non-recession trend line of the last 20 years or so @ u6=10.5. But Participation is low and there are still a couple million long term unemployed out there.  So there's still quite a bit of slack in the labor force."

Economics,3dxssv,Ateist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:17:45 2015 UTC,"I'd guess that the 120,000 new jobs are being created because the people affected by this law will have more disposable income and spend it.  The jobs being created are not the same as the jobs affected by the rule, so the labor market for those jobs won't be dramatically affected."
Economics,3dxssv,KhabaLox,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:10:06 2015 UTC,That's assuming that they will still be doing their 65-hour weeks but would actually be paid for the extra 25 hours (and at a 1.5 rate - so their salary almost doubles). But it is far more likely that the employers would hire additional help (since they would need only the normal 1x rate) instead of wasting money on overtime pay. In that case jobs created are exactly the same jobs affected by the rule or one level below (assistants).
Economics,3dxssv,HamBiscuit,0,Mon Jul 20 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"That's possible in some situations probably, but you aren't going to see a complete elimination of ""manager OT"" because of this law.

Economics,3dxssv,hollanug,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:45:51 2015 UTC,Employers start to send people home after they hit 40 hours. Or it's frowned upon. I do not see much change here.    Apart from the fact that 1) Workers have more time off for the same pay and 2) All that work that was being done in the overtime hours still has to be done by someone - either a new hire or someone who is now getting paid more.
Economics,3dxssv,PervertedBatman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:42:51 2015 UTC,More time off equals less money. And employers will just send people home after 40hours so they don't have to pay time and a half. Not every job requires people to work 50 to 60 hours a week. Those that do require someone to man the ship for over 40 will just hire someone else for a later shift and avoid paying employee A time and half while employee B could come in as a part timer and work the late shifts or balance them 40 then send them home.
Economics,3dxssv,charlesgrrr,-10,Tue Jul 21 09:53:24 2015 UTC,"More time off equals less money.   Salaried workers wouldn't be making any less money, they are paid a fixed amount yearly.   employers will just send people home after 40hours so they don't have to pay time and a half.   Which is great for those salaried employee's, they will no longer be required to work 10-20 extra hours weekly for no pay at all.   Not every job requires people to work 50 to 60 hours a week, Those that do require someone to man the ship for over 40 will just hire someone else for a later shift and avoid paying employee.   So Employee A gets his time work time reduced by half, since he is salaried he is still paid the same. Worker B is a new hire and will now be working reasonable hours as well. Employee A just got a whole lot of free time so he can spend with Kids/Family/Friends/Relaxing/Ect and Employee B just became productive again.  Whats wrong with any of this?"
Economics,3dxssv,slapdashbr,14,Tue Jul 21 14:51:44 2015 UTC,"Right, and cuts to hours of people who have to work overtime to get by.

Economics,3dxssv,Ateist,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:13 2015 UTC,"Right, and cuts to hours of people who have to work overtime to get by.

Economics,3dygs9,Newt_Ron_Starr,3,Tue Jul 21 02:32:57 2015 UTC,"The way it's usually been presented to me is something like:   Teaching as a profession has very low return to skill / talent because their effectiveness usually isn't evaluated or historically hasn't been Because of this teaching attracts a few people who could've been doctors or lawyers or engineers and just really really like teaching, but a disproportionate number of people who go into teaching because partly because they can't really do those other things and don't really mind being in a profession with low returns to skill If we can measure their performance effectively, we can figure out who the best teachers are, and pay them more; and That way we start to attract a greater share of people like the best teachers into teaching instead of into engineering, medicine, or law, which means we end up with  A much more highly-paid but also much more talented pool of teachers overall. We could be more like Finland, where teachers are paid like doctors but, like in medicine, the vast majority of 18 year olds who aspire to be teachers will fail out of that track along the way and have to do something else with their lives.   Of course, there are many good and talented and highly effective teachers already -- and if all of them were like the best fifth or even best third, our schools would be an order of magnitude better. We'd be paying them quite a lot more than we do now, maybe by a factor of three -- but probably not more than the best fifth or so of teachers could have earned in another profession if they'd chosen their focus differently in college and just after."
Economics,3dygs9,aksfjh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:41:12 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate the response.  It would seem that simply raising salaries would create more competition to enter the field, from which we could be more selective.  For example, college GPA, rigor of coursework, and presence of a degree beyond a bachelor's probably have some correlation with better teaching skills.  In other words, we could skip to 4 and then start go right on measuring teachers like we were going to.  It seems to me we would get the same thing, but teachers could feel like there was something in it for them, too.  Anything wrong with this in your eyes?"
Economics,3dygs9,slash196,2,Tue Jul 21 04:17:24 2015 UTC,"The issue in increasing pay isn't really one of teachers not qualified for the increase, it's that we haven't been able to identify which teachers qualify. It's hard to separate the good from the bad, so we essentially pay the group for their efforts, which shows smaller wages for all."
