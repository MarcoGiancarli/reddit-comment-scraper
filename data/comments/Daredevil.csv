Daredevil,3e1bfv,Heatinmyharbl,49,Tue Jul 21 04:53:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, I believe it suites his character perfectly. It shows that he has so much confidence in that people will do whatever he wants them to do because he works for a guy who controls everything and everyone. I'm not trying to dawg on you, but I think the writers really knew Wesley. He is the right hand man of the most powerful guy in Hell's kitchen who controls more than half of the police force and all of the drug rings and now promising to help rebuild HK. I think Wesley is the most confidential person and that's why he put a loaded gun on the table. And than he thought he could sweet talk Karen but to no avail."
Daredevil,3e1bfv,Bruce_Crayne,7,Tue Jul 21 05:54:27 2015 UTC,I don't think confidential means what you think it means :p
Daredevil,3e1bfv,Astrocricket,7,Tue Jul 21 18:38:18 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. I just recently got done watching the show again and loved this part even more. He truly believes that he is in control of the situation and doesn't expect Karen to reach for the gun at all.   Then, when she does, he remains completely calm and tries to play it off. And I think he is almost successful. A normal citizen like would not have shot him multiple times as Karen did.   But that's just it. We don't know everything about Karen yet. Which is even more echoed by here line that goes something like ""Do you really think this is the first time I've shot somebody?""   Great scene. Hated that he died because I really liked his character. But great scene."

Daredevil,3e1bfv,workerbee77,2,Wed Jul 22 00:19:28 2015 UTC,"Plus it gave us a chance to see Wesley try to lie his way out of a huge fuck-up, which was great"
Daredevil,3e1bfv,CryoftheBanshee,23,Tue Jul 21 23:01:25 2015 UTC,"He underestimated Karen... he is human, not God."
Daredevil,3e1bfv,JayceeThunder,6,Tue Jul 21 08:34:34 2015 UTC,Yeah he didn't think she had it in her. Even when she stole the gun he didn't seem overly concerned.
Daredevil,3e1bfv,matty25,13,Tue Jul 21 18:45:31 2015 UTC,"I literally just finished watching it. I believe it suited Wesley personality as an intimidation expert, he simple underestimated that she would be to afraid to find out."
Daredevil,3e1bfv,willadair,11,Tue Jul 21 08:08:42 2015 UTC,It was working at first... But the phone call from Fisk distracted him enough for her to react. He was in control until that moment... I had absolutely no problem with that scene.
Daredevil,3e1bfv,o7mike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hated that Wesley died, but that's another thing this show does well. It is so real that they will kill anyone. I truly believed Wesley was gonna lie his way out because the acting in this show is so freaking good. And now that karen has killed, it'll make the second season so much more interesting. Hope we helped!"
Daredevil,3dzs1w,methanococcus,19,Mon Jul 20 21:18:35 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that it's crazy that they went to all those lengths to show how skin-tight super-thin clothes can be heavily armored, but still went ahead and made a bulky, obviously armored suit.  My main problem with the cowl isn't that it doesn't look like his ninja mask. I'm just annoyed that they covered up his nose. That's never been a consistent part of Daredevil's costume in the comics; it looks too Batman-y in my eyes.  I want them to get rid of some of the black detailing, make it thinner (again, they did a whole subplot to justify its thinness), make the horns a little more prominent, and fix the nose."
Daredevil,3dzs1w,alianov,4,Mon Jul 20 21:56:43 2015 UTC,I think these sentiments are common enough I really expect them to tweak the suit before we see it again. Here's hoping anyway. I liked things about the suit but I agree with you that it just went too far from the ninja aesthetic.
Daredevil,3dzs1w,wiccabilly,0,Tue Jul 21 03:39:30 2015 UTC,"It's funny, you say it looks a little too batman-y, and in a video I saw where they complied a bunch of clips from the show, there was one where I thought it was Batman at first.  I totally agree with everything you say, by the way.  I feel like the people who designed the gut went ""OHMIGOSH WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE MOST EPIC SUIT EVER OHMIGOSH! QUICK!   I NEED IDEAS! HOW DO WE MAKE THIS THE MOST EPIC SUIT EVER?! AWKWARD EAR SLITS AND AWKWARD COVERAGE! PERFECTTTTTTT!"""
Daredevil,3dzs1w,pandakatie,5,Tue Jul 21 21:17:12 2015 UTC,"When he was given the suit, they guy told him that the red parts give the most protection. How the hell is daredevil supposed to know where the red parts are?"
Daredevil,3dzs1w,ryan924,4,Tue Jul 21 05:11:07 2015 UTC,Potter told him about the colours because he didn't know that Daredevil was blind. Matt can probably feel a difference in the materials though.
Daredevil,3dzs1w,getmuffed,4,Tue Jul 21 08:46:04 2015 UTC,"Potter said that everything on it wasn't finished up yet, so maybe there are some adjustments that will be made to the suit in Season 2. I personally don't mind the suit much, the mask definitely does look a bit weird after being so used to the cloth mask though. He goes from looking like a sort of street ninja to being a guy in a costume in one quick transition. I think if they removed the ""eye"" parts it would look much better. Though, maybe part of the reason they are there is so that his identity is further hidden."
Daredevil,3dzs1w,OMGITSJAD,3,Mon Jul 20 21:37:27 2015 UTC,The eye holes are for that exact reason.
Daredevil,3dzs1w,WhatImMike,2,Tue Jul 21 01:25:00 2015 UTC,"I quite like it, I thought it was goofy at first, but when I finally saw the last episode when he had it it really warmed up. I think the weird thing about it was that it covered the nose, which I can agree isn't accurate but I like it.  Overall it's leaps and bounds above the 2003 film."
Daredevil,3dzs1w,butterprime,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:55 2015 UTC,"I hate the black parts, wish it was full red like the comics..."
Daredevil,3dzs1w,Ramiro21,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:31 2015 UTC,"Same here.  I feel like the black parts and the mask is what ruins it.  If it was all read and the mask wasn't so much like a helmet with those awkward black eye holes, it would be so much better. I made this shitty photoshop thing to try to show what it could be.  His neck area kind of looks like a poorly knit sweater and his eyes looks like I just colored them in, but I tried to keep the fabric constant throughout.  I'm pretty proud of his shoulders, though.  I tried to do a full body one, but it kept turning out terribly and my pink hurts because I was doing it on my laptops touch area thing."
Daredevil,3dz7t1,DrStudMuffin,9,Mon Jul 20 18:54:45 2015 UTC,"Fisk has a pretty threatening presence.  I feel like he probably assumed that Ben would be scared into telling him the truth, despite everything.  Or even if Fisk knew that Ben was going to lie, he would definitely be hoping Ben would tell the truth.  He didn't really have all that many options, at that point.  He knew that at least Ben had talked to his mother, had learned of his past, of his lies.  He only found out at all because of the lady at the bulletin, and his mother couldn't tell him.  Fisk asked Ben if he was alone, because he honestly did not know, and was hoping that maybe, maybe, Ben would tell him the truth.  That's just my interpretation, anyways! Hope this helped!"
Daredevil,3dz7t1,pandakatie,2,Mon Jul 20 19:52:35 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much the impression I got from it too. I know if I was in that situation, I would be terrified at the thought of what kind of things he would do to me if he knew I was lying, even though he would probably kill me even if I told the truth. I guess it's just a testament to how loyal a character like Ben is. Thanks for the input!"

Daredevil,3dxkfp,Idk-my-name,10,Mon Jul 20 10:49:10 2015 UTC,"As much as it upset me that Wesley died, I feel like it was necessary for Fisk to transition from just Wilson Fisk to the Kingpin."
Daredevil,3dxkfp,pandakatie,7,Mon Jul 20 19:55:37 2015 UTC,"I really hated Wesley! Not in a critical/technical manner. He was written well, acted well, unique. But him taking that bullet was the biggest relief for me. Definitely a love to hate kind of guy for me."

Daredevil,3dxkfp,_venkman,6,Mon Jul 20 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"I really liked Wesley. Fisk seems kinda off in the head. I don't know if that's how the producers wanted him, but his character seems a bit airy."
Daredevil,3dxkfp,Lcar210,2,Mon Jul 20 13:10:37 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree.  Wesley killed his part.  Fisk just seemed off, kind of like Lenny from of mice of men.  Maybe it was the way he spoke. I don't know, something was definitely off with him though."
Daredevil,3dxkfp,NYYthekid216,3,Tue Jul 21 00:35:42 2015 UTC,Definitely. I would have loved to of explored more about Wesley's back story and character. It was a shame but I guess they wanted to kill someone close to Wilson for dramatic reasons. I'm hoping for some flashbacks from Fisk in the coming season. Wesley's death is an event you can't imagine him forgetting or forgiving.
Daredevil,3dxkfp,Apostle_1882,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:02 2015 UTC,Fisk will now be more confident because Wesley was his business and cultural crutch.

Daredevil,3dyk4z,BecauseRaceCar,6,Mon Jul 20 16:10:32 2015 UTC,"Having read many of the comics (Stan Lee's original run from the 60's, newer stuff,  etc.), the portrayal of Foggy is pretty spot on.  In the Stan Lee era stuff, he kept getting pissed at Matt because Karen loved Matt and not him.  He kept getting pissed at Matt because more people wanted Matt to represent him.  He felt like he was living under the shadow of Matt Murdock.  He did go a little over board in his little ""OHMIGOSH WAS ANYTHING EVER REAL BETWEEN US!"" feelings, especially as Matt was sitting there ugly-crying, but at the same time he was hurt, and he had gone along with so much of what Matt had wanted throughout the entire show.  When the bombs were going off, and he was in the hospital after getting a piece of glass pulled out of his side, he wanted to get up and find his friend, saying ""I'm the closest thing Matt has to family.""  What I like about this series is that all of the characters have their faults, none of them do everything right.  They react emotionally, they aren't always understanding.  And they aren't going to kill off Foggy.  He is too important to the story.  (Before any of you go ""SO WAS BEN URICH AND HE DIED!"", it's Foggy Nelson.  He's been in the comics since day 1.  He's Matt's best friend.  Although I feel like it's getting to the point where they might kill him off in the comics, he's not going to die in the show.  50+ years of being in the majority of issues is not erased so easily.  Unless you're Karen page :P"
Daredevil,3dyk4z,pandakatie,2,Mon Jul 20 20:05:19 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply, I guess I understand what you're saying and now have less contempt against Foggy's character/actor. Ok, maybe the character is just like that and expressly so.   I still feel something isn't all alright  but that might just be my own perspective and view.   I still love the show, best comic to TV series IMO  (not including animated series)."
Daredevil,3dyk4z,pandakatie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like Foggy will mellow out a little bit this season as well.  He'll be more used to what Matt does, and more accepting of it. And then we'll probably see Karen find out and we'll see her reaction, especially when she learns that Foggy has known for a while, which will be fun.  In the comics she actually found out first, because Matt wanted to get in her pants.    I'm just hoping the infamous Mike Murdock makes an appearance (Even though I know he won't, considering good ol' Mike is Matt's pretend twin brother...played by Matt)"
Daredevil,3dyk4z,RanchWorkerSlim,3,Mon Jul 20 22:27:22 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, I fucking hate him. But he's far too vital to the Daredevil character to get rid of; the comics have never done it, so I can't see the tv programme doing it."
Daredevil,3dyk4z,Heiroglyph,2,Tue Jul 21 21:48:03 2015 UTC,"The character is just supposed to be that way, but I agree that I'd rather he wasn't.  It's not a popular opinion, but I also think he can't act on the level that the rest of the regulars can. It's painful to watch him try, yet come up sounding like he's in a high-school play."
Daredevil,3dyk4z,AwesomePocket,2,Mon Jul 20 21:34:44 2015 UTC,"Gotta say I completely disagree. Matt and Foogy are like brothers, but Matt has been lying to him since the moment they met. Foggy doesn't just feel betrayed, he feels like a fool, which is a justifiable emotion for him to have.  However, to say he's self absorbed would be to ignore everything we've seen about him up until now. He, like Matt, turned down a well paying job at a high-powered firm in order to help the little guy. He's very compassionate as seen by his willingness to help Karen and Elena. Also, he's clearly an incredibly brave person, as shown by his determination to bring down Fisk despite being an average Joe from Hells Kitchen with no ninja moves or super powers to speak of."

She says he's worthless on his own, and she once said he has ""the gayest superpowers ever"".  She likes to pick fights about this with me, saying ""She knows more about the comic book universe than me"".  She also once said that ""Daredevil is overly angsty.""  (Mind you, her favourite super hero is fucking Batman)  I'm getting a little ranty. I apologize.

I bought two today, but I haven't read them yet, because one turned out to be something I bought two weeks ago with a different cover, and I was too tired to read.  My sister is basing her opinon off of comics, but not really any where DD was the main character, and I try not to bring anything else down, but I can't lie about being disappointed by my sister's opinion, since I thought we'd finally have something to talk about"

One of my favourite comic quotes from the Stan Lee era (although by this issue he was the editor, and no longer the actual writer) happened when Matt was leaving the courtroom and two cops were talking.  Their conversation went:  Cop 1: That Murdock's really made it, hasn't he?  Cop 2: You know it pal! Over coming his blindness...to become one of the country's top lawyers!   Cop 1: Yeah! Right about now, there's nobody that ought to be gladder just to be alive! Nobody except maybe...  ...Daredevil!""  Out of context it isn't the most spectacular thing, but in context (which would take way to long to explain) it was really powerful, especially when coupled with the words ""The end"" in the corner (iirc it was the first time DD comics said ""THE END"")...really powerful.

Punisher has different goals. He can't leave the heroes to their own devices because then his goals will not be met.

Daredevil,3dnli5,youmonsterikill,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:19:06 2015 UTC,in the 80's I got the sense Hell's ketchen was DD and King pen's exclusive  territory. Not sure how they play in the comics now but it use to be a place other heroes and villains had no business visiting and if you did something bad will happen. King pin's boy shot up wolverine so bad they almost killed him. Rapid fire hits he was taking was almost out pacing his healing powers.   As far as the Punisher goes Frank does not spend to much time hanging around anywhere so it's normally a hit and run situation.   IF anybody wants to add or take away from this perspective its fine.

Kevin Smith had a short run that is a good read before getting into the Bendis stuff.  Mark Waid's current run is good.  Of course, there's always Frank Miller's stuff that's fantastic."
Daredevil,3dcqc2,Swarley133,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:48:48 2015 UTC,I loved Kevin Smith's run.  Bendis' was good but there is such little dialogue that it felt slower than a daytime soap.
Daredevil,3dcqc2,lewd_operator,3,Sun Jul 19 01:08:51 2015 UTC,"The 3 Frank Miller Visionaries volumes are great.  #2 is excellent in particular (it contains the ""Elektra Saga"").  These are fantastic DD comics but they also provide wonderful, perhaps essential, background for ""Born Again.""  The same is true of Man Without Fear.   Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's Daredevil: Yellow is fantastic and gorgeous, but it too also provides background for ""Born Again.""    The sum of all this is ""Born Again.""  It is considered by many to be the best superhero comic ever made.  I don't know if it can be fully appreciated without a good dose of Daredevil context (hence the other recommendations), but it is a must-read for anybody who likes Daredevil or superheroes in general."

Of course, as other people have said, Born Again is fantastic and still remains my favorite Daredevil story. Other than that, though, there are other fantastic stories (and you can find them ALL on Marvel unlimited!) :   The Elektra Saga (Daredevil Vol. 1 #174-182) Roulette (Daredevil #191) Tyhoid Mary Saga (Daredevil #254-257, 259-263) The Man Without Fear (basically Frank Miller's telling of the origin story, pretty amazing) Guardian Devil (Daredevil Vol. 2 #1-8) Out (Daredevil Vol. 2 #32-40) [Really the whole of Bendis' run is pretty fabulous imo] The Devil Inside and Out (Daredevil Vol 2 #82-93) Without Fear (Daredevil Vol 2 #100-105) Daredevil: Yellow (which is another origin-ish story more from the perspective of Matt and Karen's relationship, which is also wonderful) I'd put Mark Waid's run here but I really love the whole run so much I can't exactly pick out my favorite stories from it"
Daredevil,3dcqc2,aljy,2,Wed Jul 15 09:57:50 2015 UTC,Chiming in that Born Again is definitely the greatest. Also loved Man Without Fear.   Daredevil Yellow is extremely different in tone from those two but also great and is a Loeb/Sale creation.   Really enjoying End of Days right now.

Daredevil,3d9buu,GoMac,16,Tue Jul 14 14:47:42 2015 UTC,So this is more pointing out an obvious flaw in killing people without questioning them than really having anything specifically to do with the Punisher or the Daredevil TV show.  Great casting though.
Daredevil,3d9buu,Murray85,7,Tue Jul 14 16:20:12 2015 UTC,Well let's hope Charlie Cox is a little better at stopping Punisher than Steve was. And thanks.. I'm really happy with the casting.

Daredevil,3d9buu,lurkerzero,9,Tue Jul 14 20:58:55 2015 UTC,"I get that this is supposed to be comedic, but i dont think these guys understand who the Punisher is. First, Punisher just teamin up with Daredevil like that? Nuh uh. Second, if the Punisher needs information or needs someone to talk, he has no problem torturing motherfuckers to get it. He would know if the person he's about to kill would have info he needed, he doesn't just walk around killing people willy nilly.  This video does however point out a shitty TV trope that i am kinda scared will happen in the show."

I haven't seen any Avengers movies (I know, I know), but doesn't that mean that the general populace should be a little less surprised about a man in a mask protecting Hell's Kitchen? There are a few times in the first season where Daredevil is teased for being a ""man in a mask"". Shouldn't they be used to superheroes by now?"
Daredevil,3d918u,slates-R-us,9,Wed Jul 15 07:09:20 2015 UTC,Wesley actually makes a reference to it when he's mocking the Russians for being taken out by a man in a mask. 'Maybe if he had an iron suit or a magic hammer...'

Daredevil,3d918u,Eagle713,3,Thu Jul 16 17:50:12 2015 UTC,"So far, all of the MCU have been superheroes.  This guy is just a man in a mask.  It looks a little funny.  He's the first street level hero in the MCU, and the first one taking on small crime instead of global threats that wreck cities.    Now, the rest of the Netflix shows that are coming are going to be doing the same thing.  Low level threats, such as organised crime, minor super villains, and non-cosmic stuff.  This is showing an interesting shift between the Avengers level stuff, where aliens invade, and the street level stuff where mob bosses are trying to gentrify a neighborhood, regardless of what the people that live there think.    So other than what they read in the papers, or see on the TV, most of these people have never seen a costumed hero.  It's a new and unique experience.  This is actually pretty cool, in that everyone get's the level of comic book story they want.  If you want gritty street level, you get it (WHERE'S MOON KNIGHT??!!??) and if you want the Avengers level super-team, you get it.  All in the same universe, with easter eggs and crossover potential.  Kinda cool.  Eagle  (They have my attention)"

Daredevil,3d918u,Eagle713,2,Thu Jul 16 11:14:32 2015 UTC,"5 years ago...Crap, 2 years, I would have agreed with you.  Ok, I still agree with you on the violent part.  However, the recent MK is not what I was thinking of, but more of the original run.    But let's face it, for someone who started out as a Batman clone (anyone for a Moon Knight/Shroud teamup?), MK has really come into his own as a unique, individual character.    But I think Marvel has figured out that what we want to see on screen is not something that has the essence of what we like about the character from the comics, but rather all of the aspects of the character we like.  I mean, why do you spend huge amounts of money to make Spiderman's costume look that good, then leave his wisecracks out of the script?  Moon Knight is the exact type of character that I think they could surprise us with.  And I can't think of a better place for him to appear than the Netflix  street level series.  And of those, Daredevil is where I would love to see him, just due to the simple fact that those characters have such different ideas and methods on accomplishing their goals.  Have you seen the  MK fan film trailer?  It gave me some hope what Marvel can do with it.  Eagle  (I love fan films!)"
Daredevil,3d918u,WhatImMike,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:23:15 2015 UTC,"I have not seen it. Can you PM it to me? I'm not familiar with his very early stuff, I've read the 06 run and the current run.   I agree he should show up in DD, but he needs to be a recurring character. I don't think people would grasp the multiple personality disorder that makes him so unique.   They could bring him in after Civil War since he did register. Have him be based in Chicago then relocate to NYC after he registers. I would prefer Mr Knight if that happens. He could still vigilante but be within the law doing so.   I also really wanted Vanessa's art gallery to be named Spector Fine Art Gallery. Nice little way to bring him in."
Daredevil,3d918u,Eagle713,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"Nah...I am not going to PM that, when there are enough MK fans in this sub that will want to see it.  http://www.fanfilms.net/  Click on Moon Knight.  I think the way they are doing Punisher and Elektra is the way to go, IF they spin them off once they have them established.  One of the things that I do not like about the way that Flash and Arrow have worked is that the supporting cast keeps growing, and it starts being a case of the spotlight time being spread to thin.    But MK would be a good fit for a 'tryout' in DD.  It would allow the contridiction between their two philosophies on crime-fighting to shine, and in doing so, really develop Matt's character more.  Season one was very much like S1 of Arrow, in that Matt was figuring out who he is going to be as a hero, and what his real views on killing are.  It was nice to see how it all worked out.  Eagle  (Can't wait to see S2, since both newbies are kill-happy)"

Daredevil,3cltog,ramszil,2,Thu Jul 9 04:53:14 2015 UTC,Absolutely in the same boat. All I could think of was old boy which is no bad thing.  Enjoyed seeing our hero get hurt though later on I was a bit put off by the silly level injuries... I think that's adressed by the end though?

Daredevil,3ck183,thefriendzonefriend,22,Wed Jul 8 14:50:30 2015 UTC,"I think they are going to portray The Punisher and Elektra as contrasting entities. He'll watch The Punisher, a vigilante similar to DD, start doing questionable stuff while EleKtra, an assassin, become more of an ally."
Daredevil,3ck183,leif777,12,Wed Jul 8 15:31:42 2015 UTC,"Season 2 sounds like it's gonna be all about Justice vs Vengeance, and which is the more deserved punishment."
Daredevil,3ck183,TragicEther,11,Wed Jul 8 16:08:56 2015 UTC,"Probably both, she tends to be objective oriented so while Matt doesn't stand on her way you can expect them to be in good terms, but she is an assassin after all and I'm guessing even if her target deserves it Matt is not going to ignore it and there will be conflict. She could also be the reason Punisher shows up, trying to kill a notorious assassin and then also targeting Matt."
Daredevil,3ck183,cesclaveria,10,Wed Jul 8 15:31:44 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that Elektra is sent after Matt for what he did to the Hand in first season. Punisher is doing Punisher things and Daredevil doesn't agree with his kill me all policy. The season will be peppered with Elektra/ Matt relationship stuff from college and in the end they have a final confrontation and Punisher does something way beyond what might be justifiable.

Daredevil,3ck183,wiccabilly,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:45:48 2015 UTC,"She should be an enemy first. I think part of what makes DD, Elektra, and Bullseye entertaining in their initial run is that it's like rock, paper, scissors. DD beats Bullseye, Elektra beats DD, and Bullseye beats Elektra. I would have her shown in flashback to establish her relationship with Matt and backstory, and then have her either solo or with Bullseye (depending on if Bullseye is in this season) hired by Vanessa to break Kingpin free.  Personally I would focus on DD vs Punisher in this season and build up Bullseye and Elektra as right and left hands of Kingpin who have a rivalry, and then next season it would all come to a head."
Daredevil,3ck183,Uncanny_Doom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:41:06 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna put it simply first by saying why not both?   She could start with Stick, and his boys then come back and Matt persuades her to help and then Matt and the Hand become best buddies. Sorta."

Daredevil,3ceq5i,bakhesh,10,Tue Jul 7 09:45:02 2015 UTC,I could imagine Daredevil using one to set up zip lines fast but that's it.
Daredevil,3ceq5i,TheFourGuy,7,Tue Jul 7 13:54:07 2015 UTC,"First off, I think realism is the wrong word for Daredevil. I mean, we've established that weird crap happens in universe. Street level seems more apt. Now to answer your question, yes he should. It shouldn't be something he just gets in one episode though. I mean, in a world where the Iron Man suit exists, whether or not it's seen, a grappling hook isn't that far fetched. Maybe have Matt find plans or a prototype for a hand-held grappling hook when going through a hideout. Then he can bring it to the guy who makes his suit, to tinker with, form into his cane."
Daredevil,3ceq5i,bogartingboggart,7,Tue Jul 7 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"I think it could be kind of cool if they let it happen over multiple episodes like a very small side plot. Every once in a while we see Matt work on it, do a test when trying to get away and fails. And maybe a couple episodes later he gets it finally working, like a mini victory, and it becomes another staple of his arsenal. If they do it I'd rather they do it like they did with the kali sticks where there was a bit of a story. He didn't just have sticks immediately. It gets revealed Stick trained Matt with them, then Stick comes into town lends Matt the sticks, they fight and Stick leaves the sticks behind almost like a parting gift."

Daredevil,3cc6lu,redwurm,8,Mon Jul 6 19:44:46 2015 UTC,About time

Daredevil,3cc6lu,enterthecircus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:58:47 2015 UTC,"Meh, does it even matter? IIRC in the comics Foggy's always been on the heavy side. Oh, definitely- I'm really hoping the Bullseye/Elektra rumours are true and they'll be cast soon!"
Daredevil,3cc6lu,hisrealface,2,Tue Jul 7 02:53:26 2015 UTC,"Nope, it doesn't matter there just wasn't much else to comment on in these pics xD"
Daredevil,3cc6lu,enterthecircus,4,Tue Jul 7 14:13:32 2015 UTC,"I anticipate JJ will get one season which deals with her origins and also introduces Luke Cage. Then Jess will join Luke in his show, so it will be kinda like JJ season 2 but not really. It will tell Luke's origin and be more from his vantage. Then Iron Fist will feature his origin but also show how he meets Luke first and then in the present Luke introduces him to Jess. Maybe by the end of Iron Fist,  Luke and Jess will have the baby on the way.   While Jess, Luje, and Danny each get one season, Daredevil will continue to go In between them, just cuz there is so much meat on the Daredevil bone compared to the other three. I'm also anticipating Matt Murdock to appear peripherally in these other shows when its organic to the stories, legal assist will no doubt be required which should be at least once per series, cuz Luke and Jess both tend to skirt the law. As for Danny, itd be cool if he knows Stick, or otherwise has connections with Matt on the martial arts side not legal.   However the writers will intentionally avoid Daredevil making an appearance in these other shows before The Defenders for obvious reasons. Depending on Ruffalo and Cumberbatch's contracts, eventually Strange and Banner have to get in here. Hulk and Strange are founding members from the comics. They need to at least cameo when the Netflix Defenders become official. Unfortunately Namor isn't possible.. What about Moondragon?"
Daredevil,3cc6lu,ZachsMind,5,Tue Jul 7 00:21:28 2015 UTC,"Why? I thought the idea was to have Daredevil, Iron Fist, whatsherface, the other guy, then Defenders. I'm not sure how I feel about Daredevil going loose on its own."
Daredevil,3cc6lu,xenothaulus,9,Mon Jul 6 22:46:08 2015 UTC,"That was and is still the plan. But Daredevil was so well received that they're doing a second season. Maybe that was the plan all along, but I'm not sure.  I don't know if Jessica Jones will be as well received, plus Iron Fist is apparently causing problems for Marvel Studios. They aren't sure how they're going to go about the supernatural elements just yet.  I think we'll get one season of Jessica Jones, one season of Iron Fist, one season of Luke Cage, two seasons of Daredevil (which introduces the Punisher), and then the Defenders.  I wish they didn't announce the Defenders so early on. Now they're sort of stuck since people are expecting it."
Daredevil,3cc6lu,420_BonerHitler,7,Mon Jul 6 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"I wish they hadn't either. I've always felt they had bit off more than they could chew, and made some odd choices other than Daredevil.   I am fine if they change their plans, but I do wish they would communicate it to the fans, and they could have done a better job integrating or introducing characters in each series. Iron Fist could have had a cameo in Daredevil, for example (even though I believe at least Crane Mother did), Luke Cage could cameo in AKA Jessica Jones, etc. That would be especially useful for more casual fans who don't really follow news or announcements."
Daredevil,3cc6lu,xenothaulus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:37:07 2015 UTC,Well at least Luke Cage will be in Jessica Jones.
Daredevil,3cc6lu,420_BonerHitler,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:39:59 2015 UTC,Luke Cage is a supporting character in Jessica Jones (there are production photos showing this floating around) and while I understand where you are coming from I enjoy the secrecy Marvel employs.  Mostly because since their laid out their slate of movies until 2019 it ruined a lot of the anticipation and suspense of the Infinity Stones knowing what's coming.
Daredevil,3cc6lu,Noggin-a-Floggin,3,Tue Jul 7 18:49:53 2015 UTC,"Wait, what do you mean?  They already filmed Jessica Jones and are starting Luke Cage now"
Daredevil,3cc6lu,enterthecircus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:24:57 2015 UTC,There were two Iron Man movies before The Avengers so this isn't the first time Marvel has done something like this.  Daredevil can have another singles story before The Defenders crossover.  We are getting Jessica Jones before then so Marvel clearly has a plan they are going with.
Daredevil,3cc6lu,Noggin-a-Floggin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:46:41 2015 UTC,I like it. Especially since I just hate Krysten Ritter so my enthusiasm for Jessica Jones is kinda flat.

Daredevil,3cc6lu,Dynastydood,3,Tue Jul 7 00:30:24 2015 UTC,I hope you're right. The actress just rubs me the wrong way but I've been surprised before. And Marvel does have a stellar record when it comes to casting.

Daredevil,3c12x9,MagicalTree9000,11,Fri Jul 3 20:09:34 2015 UTC,"Go with neither of those. I'd start with the Brian Bendis trade volumes and then roll right into Ed Brubaker.   Frank Miller's stuff is classic but it doesn't have the readability a modern reader coming to it for the first time may want. To me, those Bendis/Brubaker years are the best run the comic has had.  After you finish those then you can go back and do the Miller stuff and the Kevin Smith run if you want to see some of the earlier groundlaying works.  Mark Waid run is absolutely phenomenal too, but it really is better if you've read the other eras first. Part of what makes his run (especially the earlier portions of it) so amazing is the way that it toys with / flips up the conventions the series has typically stuck to. If you haven't gone through dozens upon dozens of the heavier darker grimmer Daredevil stuff before stepping into the breezy clarity of Waid you won't appreciate it for what it is / was trying to do."

Daredevil,3c12x9,Fenderboy771,2,Sat Jul 4 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly I would recommend going in order with The Man Without Fear by Frank Miller, Frank Miller's run, Born Again, Guardian Devil, Bendis' run, and then Waid's run.  Knowing and having properly experienced certain events in DD's history makes certain later/modern stories have more weight. After reading Miller's Elektra stuff for example, certain things that happen in Bendis' run are WAY more epic, and just don't have the same impact if you hadn't read it. Same goes for Born Again before Guardian Devil, and some other things."

Daredevil,3c454a,o7mike,9,Sat Jul 4 21:26:40 2015 UTC,"I think the shows doing just fine...   I thought Wilson Fisk was great, not to take anything away from Matt who was also great, but Wilson Fisk was a much more interesting character. He was unstable, conflicted, powerful, and dangerous."
Daredevil,3c454a,Tasadar,8,Sat Jul 4 18:40:35 2015 UTC,"He seems almost like he has aspergers. He's fucked up, he has trouble identifying with people and holding sympathy, he's very singleminded and sees the world in black and white. I think it's a far more realistic realization of a super villain. Also his fight scenes kick ass, he's just super strong."
Daredevil,3c454a,pjor1,4,Tue Jul 7 04:49:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't really understand how a man of his weight (and considering he always had assistants do fighting for him) was able to throw around and do some pretty good damage to people during fights. I found his speech odd but unique, and made me think of how actually complex this character is."
Daredevil,3c454a,flipperkip97,2,Mon Jul 6 00:11:44 2015 UTC,"I hated this guy so much! But that's not a bad thing. He was one of the reasons I kept watching the series. I think he's one of the best villains ever. He's shy, but also sadistic as fuck and went insane sometimes.  I hope he doesn't come back, though. I had quite a few moments where I wanted to smash my TV screen. :P"

Daredevil,3bqsbs,CamTheGringo,2,Fri Jul 3 13:49:40 2015 UTC,True. He did try to kill bullseye though even though he lived Daredevil wasn't 100% sure he would survive that fall. But ya he doesn't go around killing like punisher
Daredevil,3bqsbs,katemurdock92,4,Fri Jul 3 17:03:47 2015 UTC,"That's kind of his whole point. And dramatic story. He's so close to becoming what he hates, that if he ever crossed that line he'd be no better than Fisk or Wesley. Also he's Catholic, and they're very very VERY anti-killing. That's why he keeps going back to his priest throughout the series as he struggles with how to 'deal with' Fisk. So no, he hasn't killed anyone in the series. I'm on my third watch of it, I would know. Lol!"
Daredevil,3bqsbs,CamTheGringo,2,Tue Jul 7 02:04:15 2015 UTC,Ya he definitely didn't kill anyone on the show. I ment his overall history. Not saying he's going around slaying thugs but he fucks them up more then say Spiderman. Tryed to kill bullseye in the comics tho he lives DD was willing to let him die. But ya he's not a straight up murderer I was kinda wrong. Probably because I feel in love with DD after the first movie and still love it to this day. With in the first 30 mins he let's that guy get killed by the C-train so my first impression was dude DD will kill. But he's only really tried to kill Bullseye in the comics and set out to kill kingpin bit he didn't. Can't wait for season 2 though!!!
Daredevil,3bqsbs,katemurdock92,3,Tue Jul 7 02:14:38 2015 UTC,"Right, I can see that. That's another drama device- the line blurs after awhile. Is letting someone die really any better than killing them? That kind of thing. Me too, me too! It's my favorite show ever. lol"
Daredevil,3bqsbs,CamTheGringo,2,Tue Jul 7 02:19:57 2015 UTC,"True didn't think of that. Like Batman said I don't have to save you or something like that. Heck ya I think Punisher will be a great story line to the show. Just wish they would make a Marvel legends action figure line with Matt,the Black suit , Mark I red suit , Punisher, Bullseye , Stick Yellow comic DD with a build a figure Fisk"
Daredevil,3bqsbs,katemurdock92,2,Tue Jul 7 02:25:59 2015 UTC,And Wesley! He's my second favorite character behind Matt. I wish they had given us more background on him. :(
Daredevil,3bnaix,Eveningstar2,11,Tue Jun 30 16:21:27 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone! I finished watching Season 1 of Daredevil a couple weeks back, and I was inspired to write a short piece about Vincent D'Onofrio's portrayal of Wilson Fisk, which I thought was just sublime. I really believe he did for the Kingpin what Heath Ledger did for the Joker. I also talk a little about why I think Daredevil is a work of Gothic Fiction in the superhero genre, and why Fisk and Murdock are foils of each other.  There are a few spoilers, but nothing huge. I'd love to know what you think. Thanks!"
Daredevil,3bnaix,Teive,3,Tue Jun 30 16:21:40 2015 UTC,"I love whar you've written. I've never learned about Gothic tropes, but seeing them laid there made a lot of sense. I really like how that lens adds to the show.   But I'm curious why the violent Fisk is necessarily where the masks falls off? What makes that more 'genuine' than any other facet?"
Daredevil,3bnaix,Teive,3,Tue Jun 30 20:06:16 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm actually not sure it's necessarily where the mask falls off. I'm still a bit gunshy about spoiling the series; I know it's been around for a while now, but I'd argue there is a definite sense that...by the last episode, Fisk has decided to show his true colors.  It's still so ambiguous though, isn't it? Even when he's being incredibly violent, there's something sad and tragic in the way he commits his violence. Chalk that one up to D'Onofrio's brilliant acting.  Thanks so much for reading!"
Daredevil,3bnaix,Squago119,2,Tue Jun 30 20:44:46 2015 UTC,"That does make sense, regarding the spoilers. Maybe consider writing another piece with full scope?"

Daredevil,3b9msb,MontyHaze,11,Sun Jun 28 23:43:54 2015 UTC,"Since New York is so incredibly large, I've heard natives hardly ever say New York City itself (sometimes referring to it as The City), but basically talk about the different boroughs and districts as their own entities. For example, a guy would talk about leaving Brooklyn and visiting his friend in the Bronx or going out to Manhattan. Hell's Kitchen is another one of these districts, so it's implied that they're in NYC the whole time."
Daredevil,3b9msb,Sprintspeed,4,Sat Jun 27 12:38:29 2015 UTC,"Hell's kitchen is a neighborhood in Manhattan, so its not just the same thing. So it is a bit odd they only refer to Hell's Kitchen and not even manhattan"
Daredevil,3b9msb,fire_and_shit,3,Mon Jun 29 23:58:30 2015 UTC,"Plenty of us talk specifically about neighborhoods when we're taking to other New Yorkers. Hell's Kitchen might not necessarily be one that people talk about much anymore since not much happens there, but places like Williamsburg, Tribeca, Chinatown, Jamaica, Riverdale, and tons of others are referred to only by neighborhood name, and it's just always assumed you know which part of the city it is. Each one has a fairly distinct feel and culture, so that's why we treat them like separate towns within the massive city.  It's not a huge stretch to do the same with Hell's Kitchen, even though it probably hasn't been frequently referred to by anyone since before the 90s."
Daredevil,3b9msb,Dynastydood,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:15:51 2015 UTC,Ok I'll take your word for it. Although something just seems a tad strange when he's like' Don't destroy hells kitchen' and then suddenly 'if I see you in my city again you're dead' (not his word but you get the picture). It would make more sense to say something like 'If I see you in Hell's Kitchen you're dead'   Just seems strange how he never mentions New York or even Manhattan but calls it 'my city' when he only cares for Hell's kitchen
Daredevil,3b9msb,fire_and_shit,2,Wed Jul 8 11:29:48 2015 UTC,oh wow haha I didn't even know that. I'm not from NY so I guess I assumed it was as large.
Daredevil,3b9msb,Sprintspeed,4,Tue Jun 30 04:04:23 2015 UTC,"Nor am I :P. Your point about NYC being  incredibly large is right though. Daredevil is only a man with limited funds, he can't travel around the whole of NYC or even Manhattan to help people, so keeping his neighborhood safe is the most viable thing to do. I also think he does love NYC as much as HK, however in his fights 'my city' may be used to intimidate his opponent.   That's just my theory,"

It's a part of NYC and is a real place.  Every now and then he'll go elsewhere, but for the most part he's the hero of Hell's Kitchen.  He does specifically consider Hell's Kitchen 'his city' even though overall its just a small part of New York City itself.  New York City does get mentioned specifically, but DD is primarily focused on Hell's Kitchen since it's an area that is 'neglected' (can't think of a better word) and is where he was raised so he has a reason to want to make it a better place.  All of the NYC heroes seem to primarily focus on a different part of the city with various degrees of overlap ... hell Johnny Storm saw a riot going on [in the DD comics] and said he didn't have time to deal with those types of issues since the FF has to deal with issues on a galactic scale [paraphrased, he may have said global, but IIRC he mentioned an alien invasion or something] ... this was in the arc with Typhoid Mary if anyone wants to look it up."

Daredevil,3b7zjd,eoinster,7,Fri Jun 26 20:12:00 2015 UTC,We could see Kingpin emerge maybe at the end of Defenders.  I could see the Defender arc leading towards the Iron Serpents and the Black Sky and then at the end is the rise of Kingpin.
Daredevil,3b7zjd,BrahquinPhoenix,10,Fri Jun 26 19:54:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if they gave him one season off screen to be in jail and develop his kingpin persona without much emphasis on it, then drop him early or midway through the third season. It would be cool to start off s3 with one main antagonist then put kingpin in the mix out of nowhere."

Daredevil,3bb35f,McFeely_Smackup,12,Sat Jun 27 14:50:29 2015 UTC,I thought they did a fine job personally. I very much liked the fact that it took time for wounds to heal on the characters.
Daredevil,3bb35f,HellbillyDeluxe,3,Sat Jun 27 16:35:49 2015 UTC,I don't think it's makeup so much as lighting. The lighting - or maybe the color correction - does make the makeup look a teensy bit off to me. But I didn't mind too much because the lighting/color choices really contribute to the gritty feel that I like.

Wesley shielded Fisk from a lot of realities that he didn't want to face.  Ben's death was shocking because Ben Urich has been a major figure in the comics for yearrrrrs."
Daredevil,3azogw,CypressJoker,30,Wed Jun 24 22:19:45 2015 UTC,"I'm reading how many people were surprised by Ben Urich's death. I'm not familiar with the comics, so the moment he came on, I was like ""older black mentor figure? Dead."""
Daredevil,3azogw,CypressJoker,23,Wed Jun 24 22:56:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's a pretty big deal in the comics.  Even beyond that though he was a really interesting character that they could have done a lot with, so I was surprised they killed him regardless of being and old smart black dude."
Daredevil,3azogw,matty25,4,Wed Jun 24 23:06:18 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought he was great.
Daredevil,3azogw,pandakatie,3,Thu Jun 25 01:11:58 2015 UTC,"I'm upset about Ben's death mostly because in the comics he did a lot of bad ass stuff.  Not badass as in ""Imma go crack these names and take these skulls"" but badass as in...badass.  Like, he figured out Daredevil's secret identity and in one issue (I don't know which one) he was calling out Matt on his shit and said something to the effect of ""You let every girl you sleep with know you're Daredevil"""

Daredevil,3azogw,JimmyMcShiv,2,Fri Jun 26 21:49:07 2015 UTC,Do yourself a favor and pick up DareDevil: End of Days.   It is a Ben Ulrich story and will explain why everyone was shocked that he died.
Daredevil,3azogw,FrancisGalloway,21,Thu Jun 25 20:09:31 2015 UTC,"I'm kind of annoyed at how awesome Wesley was. He didn't even need Fisk, he clearly could have run the operation even better alone."
Daredevil,3azogw,nopurposeflour,6,Thu Jun 25 01:14:34 2015 UTC,Wesley wasn't crazy or ruthless enough.
Daredevil,3azogw,FrancisGalloway,22,Thu Jun 25 02:59:51 2015 UTC,"He was ruthless enough. And madness isn't exactly a good quality.  It just sort of pisses me off how everyone spoke about ""Wesley's employer"" with such fear, and awe, and respect. And then we see him and his an awkward manchild whose only connection to his business is Wesley."
Daredevil,3azogw,Heiroglyph,8,Thu Jun 25 03:03:51 2015 UTC,Wesley was like the missing part of Fisk's personality. The pair made one complete villain.  I can't believe how they killed him off either. Very weak way to take him out. I just can't see him just leaving it on the table like that.
Daredevil,3azogw,mastyrwerk,8,Thu Jun 25 04:21:28 2015 UTC,"Weak?  That scene was awesome!  So often I see the ""gun on the table"" trope and nobody ever reaches across and snags it away from the villain.  And then to shoot him!

Daredevil,3azogw,CeruleanRuin,2,Sat Jun 27 18:59:56 2015 UTC,Also shows she knows how to handle a gun.   There's backstory there.
Daredevil,3azogw,manabanana21,2,Mon Jul 20 05:39:27 2015 UTC,Maybe Wesley was working in overthrowing fisk and was just biding his time for the ideal moment
Daredevil,3azogw,TRB1783,2,Thu Jun 25 04:01:02 2015 UTC,I thought he was the one to order the hit on Vanessa up until Owsley admitted to it.
Daredevil,3azogw,platypuspracticus,15,Thu Jun 25 23:22:37 2015 UTC,"That's what made it perfect: it elicited such a strong reaction. I was shocked by it when I saw it and wanted so much more from Wesley but then I realized ""oh shit, Fisk just lost the person closest to him who kept him somewhat grounded"". And that's the difference between Wilson Fisk and the Kingpin."
Daredevil,3azogw,scootnoodle,15,Thu Jun 25 07:34:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, dude I disagree!! His death was actually shocking to me! When that scene happened I thought for SURE she was gunna wimp out and not kill him, but then she did and it was so surprising! He just seemed so bad ass and smart it was almost scary. You could say I was pleasantly surprised to see him go!"

Daredevil,3azogw,books-tea-gaming,5,Thu Jun 25 02:20:46 2015 UTC,"I agree, I was super bummed about him :( I'm really hoping for some flashbacks with him and Wesley, I'd love to find out how they started working together."
Daredevil,3azogw,floggable,3,Thu Jun 25 03:20:23 2015 UTC,"I agree that he was a cool character with a lot of potential, but his death was such a powerful and surprising scene, I can't be mad.  I feel the same way about Urich (shockingly untimely death, but so well done that it was worth it) but what with him being such an important character in the comics, and the deaths of some other major characters in AoS and AoU, I'm starting to wonder if there might be a plan in the MCU, maybe a couple of years down the road, to do some kind of crazy time shift, or introduce some character that brings a bunch of people back from the dead, so that some of these folks can return and fulfill their roles.  It seems a little far out for a world that is otherwise relatively grounded for a superhero universe, but we are going to get Doctor Strange, right?  So I feel like anything is possible."
Daredevil,3azogw,cocainelady,3,Thu Jun 25 08:21:43 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely love to see him in some flashbacks.  He was one of my favorite characters and I was devastated when he died.  However, I don't want him to somehow be alive in season 2.  I'd be OK with just some flashbacks at this point."
Daredevil,3azogw,DMann420,3,Thu Jun 25 12:39:31 2015 UTC,It's kind of odd but I always feel bad for Fisk after Wesley dies.
Daredevil,3azogw,enterthecircus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:56:38 2015 UTC,OK I just wiki'd Ben Urich and now I'm disappointed.  He sounds more bad ass on paper than he was in the Netflix series.

Daredevil,3ayp84,darthrich,10,Wed Jun 24 18:40:19 2015 UTC,"Eh? Where's the evidence for that?  As far as I can tell, everything in the MCU takes place largely in chronological order (with the exception of the bulk of The First Avenger, obviously), and Daredevil came out before Age of Ultron. (at the very least, there's nothing to indicate that the events of Daredevil happened after the events of Age of Ultron)"
Daredevil,3ayp84,EVula,12,Wed Jun 24 19:49:11 2015 UTC,One of the news articles Karen reads is dated September 5 2015.
Daredevil,3ayp84,likewise45,3,Wed Jun 24 21:13:44 2015 UTC,"If this is true then he better be in the index since at the end of AoU S.H.I.E.L.D. have already stabilized, not to mention they have that mega base with the avengers."
Daredevil,3ayp84,CypressJoker,3,Thu Jun 25 14:07:52 2015 UTC,"Considering his powers may be entirely impossible to prove, and have little potential for destruction, he likely went entirely under SHIELD's radar.  Beyond that, the Devil of Hell's Kitchen's identity is completely unknown, and SHIELD likely wouldn't look to a blind lawyer for their suspect.  That's been how Matt kept his identity secret for a loooong time."
Daredevil,3ayp84,AwesomePocket,4,Wed Jun 24 22:18:05 2015 UTC,"It's not about his powers since the index isn't really only about people with powers(see knife finger lady). Also, it's not about bad guys or people with destructive tendencies. Moreover, a vigilante in a mask  in one of the major cities in the US should definitely catch S.H.I.E.L.D's attention."
Daredevil,3ayp84,MasterLawlz,2,Thu Jun 25 14:10:12 2015 UTC,Exactly. The Index catalogues exceptional people. And it must have a loose standard because we know about the dumb knife finger lady. A vigilante that captures a powerful crime lord and makes national news? That's not something they'd ignore.
Daredevil,3ayp84,traceurtiger,2,Sat Jun 27 23:47:57 2015 UTC,Daredevil is more of an urban legend I think. It's not like anyone has pictures of him.
Daredevil,3ayp84,jasa159,4,Wed Jun 24 23:38:02 2015 UTC,He has a video beating cops in the news. And by the end of the series everyone in Hell's kitchen pretty much know about him.
Daredevil,3ayp84,traceurtiger,3,Thu Jun 25 14:30:41 2015 UTC,"I think it takes place after shield collapsed, and I don't think he was that active until around the time the show started. He probably never attracted enough attention, until the show.  Maybe season 2 or defenders will address that."

MAJOR FINALE SPOILERS FOLLOWING   Anyway in the later episodes when he appears at Ben Urichs flat. I was expecting a jump scare but surprised to see him there. Anyway he goes into some dialogue about his mother and ends with something similar to ""that was my mother Mr Urich. My mother. So no, I'm not here to threaten you. I'm here TO KILL YOU!"".

Daredevil,3aqgwd,Crookmeister,2,Tue Jun 23 00:26:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually seen it, but everyone I've talked to says it's incredible. I've yet to hear a bad word about it."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,falcon4287,3,Tue Jun 23 00:35:47 2015 UTC,"Definitely watch it. Matthew and Woody's acting is top notch. And the  whole atmosphere the writer gave it is very grim and eerie the whole show, it's great."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,Crookmeister,3,Tue Jun 23 01:52:29 2015 UTC,I completely under estimated Fargo. I instantly got hooked after watching the pilot.
Daredevil,3aqgwd,_y2b_,3,Tue Jun 23 06:27:27 2015 UTC,CHUCK
Daredevil,3aqgwd,jekylll,2,Sat Jul 4 03:40:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Adam Baldwin is such a great actor. His character is very cliche and rugged on the outside, but he becomes a deeper and deeper character as the series goes on, and really gets to show all the angles of his acting that I wish he had gotten the opportunity to do with Jayne on Firefly.    Oh no, you made me think about Firefly... hold on, someone just threw an onion at my eyes..."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,falcon4287,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:47:15 2015 UTC,"Chuck is my favorite show. All of the character development is amazing. I agree about Adam Baldwin. I really like him in Chuck and even though he's supposed to play the straight man, they really develop his character."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,jekylll,20,Sat Jul 4 15:24:41 2015 UTC,"Sense8 on Netflix, it's an adult themed sci-fi almost super hero type of show but it has good drama, great fight scenes and solid acting.  Also if u like martial arts & If u haven't seen marco Polo on Netflix check that out too. ""Thousand eyes"" the blind monk kicks major ass."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,azsincitymagic,3,Mon Jun 22 18:49:14 2015 UTC,"Sense8 is great show but its more of character drama with scifi superhero element, especially for the first half.  I would definitely recommend it though.  And marco Polo"
Daredevil,3aqgwd,traceurtiger,16,Tue Jun 23 03:24:17 2015 UTC,Arrow?
Daredevil,3aqgwd,Jagerbum,15,Mon Jun 22 18:14:15 2015 UTC,No no no no.   Daredevil is what I wanted Arrow to be.

Daredevil,3aqgwd,PM_me_yo_chesticles,3,Tue Jun 23 00:32:00 2015 UTC,Season 1 and 2 of arrow are really good though.
Daredevil,3aqgwd,Bojell,8,Tue Jun 23 05:10:38 2015 UTC,"You just watched the best superhero show on television. Anything else is going to be a letdown.  I really liked The Flash, but it's a little more formulaic."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,HaiKarate,11,Mon Jun 22 20:33:37 2015 UTC,Have you seen Agents of Shield or Agent Carter?
Daredevil,3aqgwd,IamUltimate,10,Mon Jun 22 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar boat, but I'm sceptical about those two. Daredevil was raunchy, and I could take it seriously. I tried watching Shield but after 2 episodes I was done with the predictably two dimensional characters and teen angst storyline. Is Agent Carter the same? I know I'm being picky but Daredevil feels like the only marvel show where I was on the edge of my seat."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,canadiancarlin,12,Mon Jun 22 20:27:00 2015 UTC,"While DD definitely has the darkest feel, I loved the story of AOS. It takes a bit to build but if you give it a chance you won't be disappointed."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,IamUltimate,5,Mon Jun 22 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"Agent Carter was a little more believable, but still firmly in the family friendly realm. AoS does get better, but never truly shakes its 2 dimensional characters or teen angst."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,_Woodrow_,4,Mon Jun 22 21:15:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I feel bad for being so critical, but ever since Watchmen I can't shake this necessity for darker characters and more compelling storytelling in a Supernatural world. To me, Daredevil was everything I was looking for. Thank you for saving me the time."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,canadiancarlin,3,Mon Jun 22 22:17:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree with /u/_Woodrow_ (sorry). It does shake the shallow character vibe later on in season one (there is a good reason it feels this way early on), and it turns into a really good show. It's your time so do whatever you want with it, but I think might enjoy AoS more than you think."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,ku976,2,Tue Jun 23 02:50:54 2015 UTC,"The reveal you are referring to does work and season 1 ended well, but any growth that was had got turned back by the end of season 2. I mean they took a character with a complex and conflicted motivation and turned him into a moustache twirling joke. Injuries that made other characters interesting were just kinda forgotten when the writers got tired of it.   Don't get me wrong, it has its moments. But my family more often watches to make fun of it rather than really getting sucked into the story"
Daredevil,3aqgwd,_Woodrow_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:41:04 2015 UTC,Ok. That's your opinion and you're entitled to it. I just thought I would give /u/canadiancarlin an opposing view point. Have a good day.
Daredevil,3aqgwd,ku976,5,Tue Jun 23 16:01:59 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing abous AoS but a friend coerced me into going back and giving it a few more episodes. That show has possibly the least predictable characters of any show currently on the air. If you enjoy the MCU I really recommend giving it another shot.
Daredevil,3aqgwd,yushinokamithankyou,3,Tue Jun 23 17:25:29 2015 UTC,Took me 5 episodes for it to click.   it's worth it.
Daredevil,3aqgwd,exoskellington,-2,Wed Jun 24 20:36:32 2015 UTC,AoS is so poor in quality. I had to ditch it. Daredevil was something else entirely but I couldn't make a recommendation for one based on the other.
Daredevil,3aqgwd,Moffee,10,Mon Jun 22 20:22:25 2015 UTC,Please do yourself a favor and just watch AOS. The first few episodes aren't indicative of the show as a whole.
Daredevil,3aqgwd,IamUltimate,8,Mon Jun 22 20:28:24 2015 UTC,The mid season Captain America episode was where it really cut loose.
Daredevil,3aqgwd,Brewer846,4,Mon Jun 22 22:13:35 2015 UTC,"While I do agree that that was where the show took off, missing all the T.A.H.A.T.I stuff before that would simply leave people confused."
Daredevil,3aqgwd,IamUltimate,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:00:46 2015 UTC,"True. It does pay to watch everything before that, but it's been a roller coaster ride since then.   If needed, they could pick up enough clues after that episode."

Daredevil,3aqiwa,ServeMyBreakfast,18,Mon Jun 22 18:14:39 2015 UTC,"It would be cool, but unlikely. It took them 13 episodes to get to the red suit, I think they'd want to keep it around for a while.  I could maybe see a nod to the yellow suit in some way, either Matt wears a yellow T-Shirt/shirt just before going off to fight crime, or Foggy makes a joke like ""Why wear a red suit, why not yellow""."
Daredevil,3aqiwa,AndysDoughnuts,13,Mon Jun 22 19:13:18 2015 UTC,"I like what Bendis did in his run. Foggy mentions Matt's red suit, and Matt's like, ""I thought it was yellow"""
Daredevil,3aqiwa,Ichiroga,8,Tue Jun 23 01:43:52 2015 UTC,"The only way I see it coming up is if during a fight yellow paint falls down and messes up the suit for an episode or two until Matt is able to clean it, or maybe someone else points it to him saying how yellow and stealth don't work together."

It doesn't work in the context of the show. It would be contrived to have it in now."
Daredevil,3aqiwa,Uncanny_Doom,1 point,Fri Jun 26 09:05:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think it will, but I kind of hope the red suit that Daredevil has right now evolves a little more.  Melvin Potter did imply that it wasn't finished yet (""I haven't had enough time to put all of it through the process yet"" or something), so I'm hoping that it will improve. That's not to say the suit he has now is bad, I just don't like the black stuff around his neck.  It makes his face look werid.  Also, he needs to get the Daredevil symbol on his chest."

As soon as I read the title I thought to myself 'yeah, he actually played a really great blind guy when he had to pretend in front of others to be blind, so I guess they would honour him'.

Daredevil,3aj85n,funnygreensquares,16,Sat Jun 20 18:51:35 2015 UTC,Isn't it because his dad put money on himself for the fight and put it in savings....
Daredevil,3aj85n,thedyctatr,6,Sat Jun 20 21:48:59 2015 UTC,His dad didn't have much money to bet. He probably put a nice bit of cash in his account but I doubt he'd have much if any left after law school.
Daredevil,3aj85n,Doctor-Van-Nostrand,6,Sat Jun 20 22:35:06 2015 UTC,"His dad took the fall money and bet it all on himself to win. He was more than likely a underdog. 5-1 odds at 25k, for example, is $125k return. And with it put in a savings Matt could only use to go to school on, it makes sense he would have go to the orphanage (if the rumors of his mom being a nun there pan out)."
Daredevil,3aj85n,WhatImMike,3,Sat Jun 20 22:41:52 2015 UTC,"Whoa, he was most likely not the underdog. That's why fight fixers fix fights, the fixers bet on the underdog and pay/pressure the favorite to take a dive. That's how they make money. Also, I don't know if they said 25k in the show but that is most likely way to high for a small time fighter like Battlin Jack , especially considering that they were pressuring him too."
Daredevil,3aj85n,Doctor-Van-Nostrand,4,Sat Jun 20 22:53:15 2015 UTC,He was the underdog. He was ecstatic to even get the chance to fight. The guys who paid him did so to bet that he would get knocked out or TKOed. He was known for never going down not winning. They were going to bet he went down in the 5th which would have great odds due to his reputation of always finishing the fight.
Daredevil,3aj85n,cbnyc,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:21:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, OK that does make sense. I still don't think Matt is rich though. Otherwise he would have at least gotten decent wifi for his own law firm."
Daredevil,3aj85n,Doctor-Van-Nostrand,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:35:36 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered his dad gambling it away. Do you think he's that type of person? I can kind of see him doing that, especially since he did that thing with the fixed fight even though he knew how it would end up. But with that fixed game, his dad told his bookie to put those winnings in an account for Matt. That's a lot of money, especially with interest. Another reason I feel Matt has to be loaded just super frugal."
Daredevil,3aj85n,sagmentus,5,Sat Jun 20 22:39:52 2015 UTC,"I like your theory, we don't get to know how Matt makes a living, because the law firm certainly is not ATM."
Daredevil,3aj85n,Semiramis42,4,Sun Jun 21 11:54:23 2015 UTC,His father left him a considerable amount of money after double crossing his bookies the night he died. Most of it probably went to pay for law school but he could have some on the side. However he is definitely not rich in the strictest sense.
Daredevil,3aj85n,AwesomePocket,3,Sun Jun 21 18:06:55 2015 UTC,"Also, we have to remember that Matt and Foggy were both at the top of their class in law school- I think it was even Columbia. Students that good usually get amazing scholarships. I don't think Matt is rich as much as he is not in need money-wise."
Daredevil,3aj85n,ChancelorThePoet,2,Sun Jun 21 21:25:07 2015 UTC,We already KNOW why Matt has money.  It was pretty clearly explained in the  show.
Daredevil,3aj85n,Colon-Dee,2,Mon Jun 22 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"Another good indication was in the episode ""stick"" when the nun asked Stick if he could help Matt and he said ""not for free."" I highly doubt the nuns would afford, and even if they could, I doubt they would even pay someone like Stick that kind of money."
Daredevil,3ag488,SilverMars,13,Fri Jun 19 21:30:21 2015 UTC,Nah. Spider-Man's suit was supposed to look a bit like a wrestler's. I think Daredevil's suit should be able to take a beating. He doesn't have super strength like Spider-Man does.
Daredevil,3ag488,jcurtiswood,25,Sat Jun 20 01:35:12 2015 UTC,"In the world they have set up, if Daredevil just wore spandex he would be dead in a month. He doesn't have Spider-Man's agility or reflexes to dodge pretty much everything.   Like Nolan's Batman's, this is a hero grounded in reality. That's one of the reasons why people loved the series. In reality, someone like Daredevil needs protection or else he is a dead man."
Daredevil,3ag488,JoeyJoJoShabadoJr,5,Sat Jun 20 01:36:20 2015 UTC,"Maybe a small amount of padding, but I feel they're overdoing it."
Daredevil,3ag488,cbnyc,3,Sat Jun 20 14:55:46 2015 UTC,Small amount of padding in the world they had set up with his powers would leave him dead eventually. They want Matt to be human and get hurt as opposed to Thor or captain America. Armored suit does that and fits in with the universe.
Daredevil,3ag488,bondjamesbond62,4,Sun Jun 21 23:23:28 2015 UTC,"It would be cool if Matt visited Melvin Potter for a repair or something like that and Potter has a version of Spidermans suit in his workshop.  Something he's working on for a ""really nice kid"" he met."
Daredevil,3ag488,WhatImMike,5,Sat Jun 20 11:02:36 2015 UTC,Spider-Man made his own suit so no.
Daredevil,3ag488,Uncanny_Doom,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:34:16 2015 UTC,No.  I'm fine with how the suit looks and the fact that he can move in it. The only thing that I don't like are the dark lenses of the eyes and the dark shade of red the suit is. The body armor look is fine and perfectly fits for the tone of the world they set up. He needs protection. If anything his suit should be more like Cap's in terms of losing more of the hard armor look but still look like it's protective.
Daredevil,3ag488,Try_Another_Please,-1,Sat Jun 20 18:25:20 2015 UTC,"Also, as a side note, does anyone else think that, apart from the headwear, the costumes for Ant-man and Daredevil look too generic and the exact same?"
Daredevil,3ag488,RhetoricalPenguin,6,Fri Jun 19 21:33:54 2015 UTC,They honestly don't look that similar so no. The Ant Man costume in particular looks excellent imo.  As for DD's costume they shouldn't do it like Spidey. DD needs the protection in a way Spidey doesn't. There is a reason he kept getting fucked up in season 1. A shirt doesn't cut it

Daredevil,3ad3gb,RhetoricalPenguin,15,Fri Jun 19 10:04:23 2015 UTC,Used to be a terrible place. But I hear it's pretty safe now. That's why they had to use The Battle of New York as an excuse to make Hell's Kitchen a shithole again in the MCU.

Since it ended with him crying and being so obviously worried about Betsy, he became one of those characters I just want to protect them from the big bad world (even though Melvin Potter is much older than I am and could easily kill me).  By my third watch through of season one I was referring to him as ""my baby"", so I know that as soon as he becomes the Gladiator it's going to kill me.

But since, as far as I know, there is no Eternals movie in the making, it would make more sense if they gradually introduced the Inhumans and somehow tied Daredevil in with their story. Matt Murdock is not Avengers or Guradians material, but I feel like he can work with a crowd like the Inhumans since they are quite alike : human bodies and lifespans but with one or two special powers."
Daredevil,3a152i,Dr__Nick,45,Tue Jun 16 12:23:32 2015 UTC,"He wasn't The Kingpin yet. The logic behind his master plan hadn't been fully fleshed out, but he thought of himself as a guy who was doing bad for the greater good. That's been wiped away. I'm sure he'll be back at some point, in full force as The Kingpin. The first season was his origin story as well.   Also, yeah. I'm not a huge fan of the costume either. I hope it looks good by season 2."
Daredevil,3a152i,Jeff0fthemt,18,Tue Jun 16 12:48:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It was time in prison that solidified Fisk's ideas into his criminal enterprise.   Matt and Fisk both see themselves in a moral morass. They both find themselves questioning their good and bad sides. In the end, they each EMBRACE the roles they've found themselves choosing. Now, all Fisk needs is to expand his contacts in the criminal world to create his own army, rather than rely on the armies of others. Prison will be good for him."
Daredevil,3a152i,LockjawTheOgre,6,Tue Jun 16 13:16:03 2015 UTC,In the comics Kingpin spent many years in jail so Fisk going to jail makes a lot sense. There was even a storyline where Daredevil and Kingpin where in jail together and had to work together. I speculate he will just operate out of prison until something bad happens to Vanessa which makes him fully transform into Kingpin. Do we know if Vincent D'Onofrio got recast for season 2? I only know that he got cast for the Spiderman reboot in 2017.

Daredevil,3a152i,pandakatie,14,Sat Jul 4 18:59:45 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt Kingpin is gone for good. He's arguably the most iconic Daredevil villain along with Bullseye so my guess is he'll be back in Season 2 in some capacity if not sooner.   I think the general consensus is that the red costume looks weird, but the designer already tells Matt it's not done yet so hopefully next season it's improved. Plus the Frank Miller costume was so simple and badass looking it's pretty hard to compete."
Daredevil,3a152i,Calhob42,12,Tue Jun 16 15:29:45 2015 UTC,"Heh, you think Fisk won't end up running the prison before long?  It's going to be like a cocoon to him... helping to solidify who he is so that a Kingpin emerges."
Daredevil,3a152i,senopahx,11,Tue Jun 16 16:26:04 2015 UTC,"Just like Matt is not called Daredevil until that very last episode, they spent the first season developing Fisk. He's not Kingpin yet but he will be. You know he won't be in prison for long.  For a truly bad finale, refer to Arrow season 3."
Daredevil,3a152i,Vestus65,7,Tue Jun 16 20:26:18 2015 UTC,Wilson Fisk has been arrested and thrown in prison countless times.  He'll either get out of the conviction or take over the prison.
Daredevil,3a152i,Ashenspire,8,Tue Jun 16 18:07:13 2015 UTC,"For me the suit (and some of the plot) was a little too Batman for me. The way he has to move his whole body instead of turn his neck just doesn't mesh with the agility and flexibility that Daredevil should convey. I think they should move away from the ""body armor"" idea of it and focus more on fluidity of movement."
Daredevil,3a152i,CoolHandSam,3,Tue Jun 16 22:42:54 2015 UTC,"They definitely plan on bringing him back at some point. The way Foggy mentioned how long it would take for the case just to go to trial suggests things.  Besides, are you saying you wouldn't like to see Kingpin in jail for a few episodes? It would be interesting to see him morph into the more calm character he is in the comics. To be put into situations where at this point, we know the old Fisk would kill someone in there, but instead get a sense of control over himself in order to not worsen his situation and get out. I think it could be interesting."
Daredevil,3a152i,Uncanny_Doom,0,Wed Jun 17 18:04:13 2015 UTC,"People have brought up good points, but I just think the rapid way Fisk went down based on a crooked cop and Foggy's ex copying law firm documents seemed a little silly for the degree of compartmentalization Fisk's organization supposedly had.   I would have bought Leland taking him down that fast...."
Daredevil,3a152i,weluckyfew,2,Wed Jun 17 18:11:04 2015 UTC,"I agree - why would they let one dirty cop know about their mole at the newspaper, the corrupt lawyers, etc.  Maybe if Leland had kept a  collection of documents too, with the instructions that they were to be sent to Murdock's law firm in the event of his death - would have the added touch of Fisk's lust for violence and murder being his undoing"
Daredevil,3a152i,weluckyfew,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:14:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, there's just no reason for the cop to know anything but more dirty cops for the level of player he supposedly was."

Daredevil,3a152i,Khalizabeth,5,Mon Jun 22 01:02:34 2015 UTC,"My problem with the finale is that it seemed like a superhero show, whereas the rest of the series played out like a crime show/character drama.   The more he becomes a superhero, the less interesting the show will become.  The Avengers movies are entertaining, but they don't move me.

But then a college friend, God bless her, told me to try again and I did. When I reached episode 5, I realized it all. It started to blow me away.

Daredevil,39yy95,wiccabilly,9,Tue Jun 16 00:01:30 2015 UTC,I have to agree with /u/The_Anus_Penetrator.... I actually do agree but I really wanted to say that in a sentence.
Daredevil,39yy95,ChancelorThePoet,2,Tue Jun 16 00:07:43 2015 UTC,I'm glad you voiced your opinion despite the fact that a lot of people aren't fans of hearing both sides of the story.
Daredevil,39yy95,diamened,4,Mon Jun 22 16:55:58 2015 UTC,"Not superhero, but try Banshee."
Daredevil,39yy95,_venkman,6,Tue Jun 16 00:58:06 2015 UTC,"In terms of overall quality? I don't mean any offense to the other marvel/dc/super hero shows, but there really aren't any. I enjoy agents of shield and arrow/flash/Gotham as much as the next guy, but let's face it, they're all extremely campy"
Daredevil,39yy95,x-CapedCrusader,5,Tue Jun 16 03:31:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I get that. Daredevil is a rare show where it has a superhero theme but matches the quality of really good shows like Breaking Bad. I just enjoy watching marvel/dc shows because they are fun to watch IMO. I might try arrow or Gotham thanks :)
Daredevil,39yy95,t0xicd0g,4,Tue Jun 16 08:39:56 2015 UTC,Arrow!  Season three was a little ehh but still good.  I would definitely suggest that.
Daredevil,39yy95,anotherandomer,3,Tue Jun 16 03:03:55 2015 UTC,"Arrow is like the comic book version of Daredevil. Instead of being laid up on a couch almost dying for half an episode after being stabbed in the side, Oliver just sews himself up and beats the crap out of twenty bad guys. Realism takes a backseat..."
Daredevil,39yy95,MacBeth_in_Yellow,2,Tue Jun 16 14:04:40 2015 UTC,"Arrow is good, Agents of Shield is good, but you have to push through the first 8-9 episodes, Flash is another one."
Daredevil,39yy95,Semiramis42,2,Tue Jun 16 11:20:47 2015 UTC,"The good news is that there will likely be several (albeit short-lived) Netflix series similar to Daredevil. By the end of the year we should have a season of Jessica Jones to enjoy, and I'm sure you're aware of the plans for Luke Cage, Iron Fist, and The Defenders over the next couple of years. If they all have the same level of success as DD, we might eventually get even more (although what those shows might be would be pure speculation at this point).  I really enjoyed Agents of SHIELD, but then, I'm kind of a fanboy when it comes to the MCU so you should be aware that I'm biased. To be fair though, the first season takes a long time to get set up before it really gets to be good; things don't really get started until after the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier. After that, the characters finally get some substantial development, the plot suddenly gains direction, even the special effects start to improve a bit. (FYI: The special effects budget must have increased dramatically when the second season was shot, because it shows almost immediately.) I'm not saying you'll definitely like it on second viewing, but it might be worth a shot if you're looking for more MCU-based entertainment."
Daredevil,39yy95,Sxi139,2,Tue Jun 16 17:20:21 2015 UTC,The first half of the first season of SHIELD is boring as hell. The second half is pretty decent. The finale is fantastic. The second season is awesome.....not Daredevil awesome but it's pretty damn good. You should give it a try.
Daredevil,39yy95,Muffikins,3,Sun Jun 21 18:23:33 2015 UTC,Eh not marvel but Sense8 is pretty good from Netflix.
Daredevil,39yy95,wiccabilly,2,Tue Jun 16 06:56:09 2015 UTC,Gotham is pretty good!
Daredevil,39yy95,lalr1,3,Tue Jun 16 00:52:47 2015 UTC,There aren't really any. Daredevil is a sort of hybrid between The Wire and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.... It's different in tone and content and pace due to the nature of it being a Netflix show released all at once. I would recommend The Wire though. It's not really like Daredevil but the folks who made Daredevil have clearly seen it and borrowed a little from it. Warning though: it's WAAAY heavier and can be downright cynical at times.

Daredevil,39y6sv,limeguard,3,Mon Jun 15 19:27:28 2015 UTC,Guardian Devil hands down is one of the best series you can pick up and was written by Kevin Smith.  As a Spider Man fan you'll greatly appreciate the villain and cameos. Another more recent one that's a little light hearted but great on story is Devil at Bay. Happy reading.

Daredevil,39y6sv,Orangebite,2,Tue Jun 16 20:57:37 2015 UTC,"The first tpb has content mostly written by Roger Mckenzie with Miller only on art or co-writing-ish, and I completely agree, they are kind of ehhhh, and they made me fearful that I would hate all of the run, then the last five or so issues of the tpb were written by Frank Miller, and from the first Miller issue, you can see an incredible quality jump. The Bullseye issue in the first tpb is quite easily my favorite issue of all time, I think I cry when I read it, not because it's sad, but because it's so strikingly well-written, so I strongly recommend it if just for that. Then the Waid run is my 2nd favorite, then Bendis and Brubaker are both very good, but not top 10 comic runs of all time material for me like the Waid and Miller runs both are."

Daredevil,39ufsa,Friendly_B,15,Sun Jun 14 21:41:53 2015 UTC,"13 episodes of Daredevil, 44 episodes of Agents of Shield, 8 episodes of Agent Carter, 3 Iron Man movies, 2 Thor movies, 2 Captain America movies, a Hulk movie, a Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and 2 Avengers movies.   So 11 films and 65 episodes (40-45 minutes each) of television.  So roughly 65-70 hours or so.  Edit: if you were to count non-MCU films and live action television, then you'd have easily over 100 hours not even including Mutant X (66 episodes.)  5 X-Men films, 2 Wolverine films and a Generation X tv movie.  5 Spider-Man films, 3 Blade films and 13 episodes of Blade: The Series. Universal's Hulk and 2 Fantastic Four films, 3 if you count Roger Corman's 90's film that was not intended to be released in order to retain the rights.  Also 3 Punisher films and Howard the Duck.  There were 2 Captain America tv movies in the late 70's and a low budget 1990 film. 13 episodes of The Amazing Spider-Man in the 70's as well as 82 episodes and 3 tv movies of The Incredible Hulk.

Daredevil,39ype3,ABear123,20,Mon Jun 15 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"Because its a more realistic portrayal of a man (not a mutant) deciding to take on a life of fighting crime.   Watch any Batman movie. He has to get his ass kicked. Why? Because he's just a man, biting off more than he can chew, who has to turn to his one asset to overcome his obstacles - his money.  What does Matt Murdok have? A particular set of skills. He has to work his way up the ladder. He has to start from the bottom beating up thugs while he works up to fighting the truly powerful. And I mean, he's taken down 10 Russian human traffickers after having been stabbed and bandaged up.   And, youre really going to count the beating he received from Fisk as getting his ass beat? He was already sliced and diced by Nobu by the time Fisk came out of the shadows to confront him, of course he was going to take a beating."
Daredevil,39ype3,MatticusVP,5,Mon Jun 15 22:01:59 2015 UTC,not saying I don't like it. I do like the realism.   Just wanted to get some thoughts on it.   I guess I grow suspicious of how he will be able to handle some kind of alien fighter
Daredevil,39ype3,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:09:36 2015 UTC,He won't handle some kind of alien fighter. He'd probably die ro barely win at best. He's not a cosmic level hero
Daredevil,39ype3,ParallaxBrew,7,Sat Jun 20 04:32:33 2015 UTC,"This show is a bit more realistic than most comic book shows. So yes, he gets his ass kicked a lot.  Fisk weighs 400 lbs and is 2% body fat. So yeah, he should be able to get a few good licks in against pretty much anyone."
Daredevil,39ype3,ThornBird_116,3,Mon Jun 15 23:16:10 2015 UTC,"Even though the fight with Fisk was a few days after Nobu, he still got his ass handed to him by Nobu and he was really messed up. That's why he was a lot weaker than usual when fighting in the later episodes. Personally, I like it because it adds more realism and it's more interesting to watch."
Daredevil,39ype3,Uncanny_Doom,3,Mon Jun 15 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"It's because he's a street-level hero who is going out every night to patrol. The way he struggles was one of the highlights of the show to me. That aspect of superhero lifestyle is rarely if EVER touched on. A guy with no protection on his body, who has a heightened sense of touch (meaning he feels pain to detailed levels that we don't), pushing himself out the door constantly every night to do what's right and suffering for it, that goes with the character, it goes with the themes of the show, and it was great.  I personally am not a person who enjoys heroes because of how strong they are. I want to see a struggle, and I want them to have something believable to overcome."
Daredevil,39ype3,Semiramis42,3,Wed Jun 17 18:07:03 2015 UTC,"When the show starts, Matt himself has just started the vigilante job. He has probably never had a real fight (other than Stick when he was a kid) at that point. It took time for him to hone his skills and even then, the man has super hearing and smelling but he has neither super strength nor incredible speed. I found his vulnerability very realistic and impressive but they screwed up with the recovery pace. It takes at least a few days to get somewhat better from multiple stab wounds. Matt goes on to have an epic fight and win just a few hours later."
Daredevil,39t198,Arkonisas,48,Sun Jun 14 14:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Netflix Daredevil series takes place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the first episode, the tragedy that they talk about, the one that cause major destruction, is referring to the first Avengers film."
Daredevil,39t198,wariofan14,2,Sun Jun 14 14:23:35 2015 UTC,This is also something that I wondered. Is this ongoing project intertwined with the whole Marvel Knights series (that I'm sure that I read was happening).  Also with that in mind how would this series trade off with agents of shield given that the two vary so wildly in both themes tones and overall quality? Just seems to me like the overall universe is falling apart at the seems somewhat.
Daredevil,39t198,Moffee,4,Sun Jun 14 19:36:08 2015 UTC,"The Marvel Knights films aren't connected at all. If you follow AOS, Skye went to certain orphanage, the same one that Matt Murdock was at.

There are several references to the events in the first Avengers movie, as well as the Incredible Hulk. When Matt and Foggy are looking at their new office in episode one, the Realtor mentions it is cheap because it was right under ""the incident"", which was the battle for New York. The bookkeeper for Union Allied Construction mentions how every time a super hero breaks through a building, their margins go through the roof. If you watch for them, you can easily find references like these."
Daredevil,39t198,altoid_lover,14,Sun Jun 14 14:24:50 2015 UTC,Ben Urich has newspaper front pages on his wall from the battle of New York.  So it's in the same universe.   Not sure if it goes deeper than that though.

Think about it like this: Normal people ""see"" with light; it bounces off objects and back to our eyes. This limits us to a 180-degree field of vision. If we want to see something behind us, we need to turn our heads.  Daredevil, however, ""sees"" everything around him, in all directions. It doesn't matter if an object is directly behind him--it still vibrates, absorbs and reflects sound, emits heat, causes odors, etc, all creating a visualization in his head. In the comics, he often describes this sensation as ""reaching out and touching everything at once.""  Hope this helps."

However, the rest of his senses are incredibly heightened, so he can sense things that let him know where things are.  So Matt is blind, because his eyes don't work.  Close your eyes and imagine the room that you're in.  That picture in your mind is how Matt ""sees"".  It's not exactly the same for him, because his senses give him the picture, rather than him just imagining it, but basically his remaining senses give him little bits of information that he's able to piece together to know what's surrounding him."
Daredevil,39nfu4,denimgremlin,19,Sat Jun 13 00:14:01 2015 UTC,"First off, I don't think he goes out every single night. I only noticed him going out on consecutive nights in the series when there was a lot going on with Fiske or one of the others. He is almost never out when the sun is rising so he is probably home by 5:30 most mornings which could give him anywhere from 3-4 hours of sleep. He could also nap in the afternoons. I imagine his meditation does something for his exhaustion."

Daredevil,39nfu4,thedumbprogrammer,2,Sat Jun 13 05:56:31 2015 UTC,"Considering Matt and Foggy don't have many clients, and when they do have clients Foggy does most of the tedious paperwork (Blind lawyer has excuse not to read paperwork), I would guess Matt has plenty of free time.  His powers come in handy for juror selection, interviewing clients and witnesses, chasing down leads, and knowing if his legal arguments are persuasive by reaction of courtroom. Foggy handles the rest of the stuff, which isn't fair, but who cares.  I would guess Matt spends less than 4 hours a day in the office or courtroom, and probably tells Foggy he is out following up on leads the rest of the time. He could be in costume as DD from 9pm to 3am every night and still find time to sleep a couple hours before and after."

Daredevil,39gbia,Ricktron3030,14,Thu Jun 11 18:13:20 2015 UTC,this is such a bullshit argument though. Punisher made the choice and not killing someone who is about to kill is not necessarily wrong. It is about what you attempt. Daredevil (as far as netflix version) is not compelled to do SOMETHING he is compelled to do anything he can outside of killing. Otherwise it wouldn't be 'no killing' it would be 'avoid killing when necessary'
Daredevil,39gbia,kslidz,5,Thu Jun 11 18:38:02 2015 UTC,Exactly. You can't control other people's actions. You can only control what you do.
Daredevil,39gbia,vankorgan,3,Thu Jun 11 19:49:07 2015 UTC,"yes and this shouldnt be a struggle for daredevil, if he doesnt think killing is worth stopping murder then he NEVER would no matter the situation. He may inadvertently kill while defending himself but if he draws the line at killing then this wouldnt so much as be a struggle for him."
Daredevil,39gbia,kslidz,14,Thu Jun 11 20:00:37 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but I sincerely hope the Ennis version of the Punisher is basically ignored. Garth Ennis has a hate boner for superheroes, so he wrote Frank as this unstoppable badass who showed them up at every turn, and the heroes as wimpy schmucks. In doing so, he lost a lot of the nuance that makes Frank such a great character."

Daredevil,397h4f,VegaThePunisher,7,Tue Jun 9 22:22:58 2015 UTC,It is deeper than that. He knows he is the only one who do the job because he has nothing else to live for but The War.

Daredevil,3981yu,Dr__Nick,2,Fri Jun 12 03:14:55 2015 UTC,Foggy did mention that Greek girl.  Elektra and the Hand and Bullseye and the Punisher seems a little much though....
Daredevil,3981yu,Veylis,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:05:46 2015 UTC,Hopefully they can fit more in now that the Matt Foggy development is fleshed out. I really liked the season but I must admit there were long stretches where I alt tabbed to read blogs while they were talking for 10-15 minutes and not much was happening.
Daredevil,3981yu,faggot_human_trash,7,Fri Jun 12 13:11:14 2015 UTC,"Man, Nelson v Murdock was the best episode of the series."
Daredevil,3981yu,violetmemphisblue,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"Season 2 is also supposed to be setting up more for the Defenders-- I think at one point, Jeph Loeb said he didn't want any individual show to run too far ahead of the others, so 2 seasons (2015, 2016) and then Defenders in 2017 would make sense...I don't know how much that will play into the whole season, or if it will just leave with a giant cliffhanger..."
Daredevil,3981yu,Semiramis42,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:35:13 2015 UTC,"I hope they either bring in several new important characters or do more courtroom stuff because season 1 had way too little going on and it was very often too slow. Frankly, this season could have done with 1 or 2 episodes less."
Daredevil,396z29,Sunuvamonkeyfiver,6,Tue Jun 9 18:28:33 2015 UTC,Jailing Daredevil in the comics was important because the prison was made in the negative zone and the prison ended up being a major point for battle where two equally large sides faced off. The MCU does not have the negative zone or many heroes established so that would be difficult to pull off. They're probably going an original route with this and the war will most likely be much smaller than it was in the comics.
Daredevil,396z29,Morty_And_Rick,5,Tue Jun 9 19:45:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think Daredevil will play into the movie, even though I want him to."

Daredevil,392ygx,ComeNoon,14,Mon Jun 8 22:38:17 2015 UTC,"Unlikely because, like horror for example, superhero stories are considered low art."

Daredevil,392ygx,dannzo_29,2,Tue Jun 9 02:36:17 2015 UTC,Hmm I think this is on shifting sands hopefully.   I think there may even be bias against streaming shows and Netflix due to the power of cable and network TV.

Daredevil,38xscx,diamened,2,Sun Jun 7 20:09:36 2015 UTC,"I would love some recommendations! I haven't read any Daredevil but I just finished the show. Just ordered Yellow, Born Again, and The Man Without Fear 1-5 (Miller). Does anyone have any must reads for a fan of the show?"
Daredevil,38xscx,mojowitchcraft,2,Sun Jun 7 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"Tonally, Frank Miller's Daredevil run, Bendis's and Brubaker's are closest to the show.   Yellow and The Man Without Fear are good to start with as origin stories, and the show is heavily based on Man Without Fear. I personally prefer the latter, but Yellow has some really nice stylized art.  Born Again is actually Frank Miller's return to Daredevil and is one of his greatest works. I recommend building up to it by reading Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller, which is collected in 3 volumes. The highlight of his original run is the Elektra story arc so if you were to only get one, you should get vol. 2.  Bendis's Daredevil is also good. The art by Alex Maleev really fits the gritty interpretation of DD. My favorites from his run are vol. 5 Out, where DD's identity is released to the public, but he denies the allegations, and vol. 6 Lowlife, which continues with the aftermath. His run is generally strong throughout and leads directly into Brubaker's run. The Devil, Inside and Out places Matt behind bars, in the same prison that holds his worst enemies, creating an interesting dynamic.  Mark Waid's run, which just finished up, is excellent and is a lighter spin on DD, who had reached some very low lows. The colorful art and clean lines match the more lighthearted take, It's a completely different approach on the character, breathing some life and levity into DD and is a fun read, but it's a very different tone from the show."
Daredevil,38xscx,pandakatie,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:38:43 2015 UTC,"Man I need to buy more Daredevil comics. I've read a lot of comics online, but I still get very confused about what's happening at any point in time because the ones I find online tend to be out of order, or missing issues, or who even knows."
Daredevil,38xscx,pic2022,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:33:14 2015 UTC,How is the Man without fear run?
Daredevil,38xscx,DrFurball,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:05:27 2015 UTC,"Frank Miller's Man Without Fear miniseries? It's a top notch reimagining of DD's origin story incorporating many of the characters Miller had introduced during his earlier run on DD. If you like it, you should read Miller's other DD work."
Daredevil,38yp5d,sillyninny,14,Sun Jun 7 23:39:48 2015 UTC,"Nobu actually took himself out. It's a little confusing, because there's a cut to DD retrieving his club just before the light gets shattered, so it's easy to come away with the impression that DD threw the club into it. If you go back and watch it, though, Nobu's hook attack clearly tears the club out of DD's hand, and then the hook and/or the club go flying into the light.  Some other relevant points:   It was probably Nobu that punctured the cans in the first place, as he was the one swinging a big blade around. When DD kicked him into the gasoline, he was badly wounded and on the defensive, so it's unlikely that he had any kind of plan at that point beyond just creating some space. Once on fire, Nobu continued to attack until he finally fell motionless to the ground, at which point Kingpin and his henchmen immediately entered the room, so there was no opportunity for DD to make any attempt to save Nobu."
Daredevil,38yp5d,CheekyMunky,2,Mon Jun 8 04:58:54 2015 UTC,"Not that I disagree with anything you said, you seem pretty on point - but it seems like a bit of an oversight from the writers to not make any kind of discussion about this. At the very least, DD should know or realise that his actions caused Nobu's death. There definitely should have been some kind of internal conflict, but it's kind of just ignored.   It just seems like the show glosses over it."
Daredevil,38yp5d,Rosetti,5,Mon Jun 8 15:07:31 2015 UTC,"He wrestled with the ""how far is too far"" question elsewhere in the show, I believe, when he dropped the guy off the side of the building.   In Nobu's case, DD was attacked and severely beaten, and while he was defending himself the other guy got himself killed. DD didn't really cause that, though; he walked into an ambush and had to fight for his own life against a lethal attacker, and that's all. I'm not sure why he should be conflicted about that."
Daredevil,38yp5d,CheekyMunky,2,Mon Jun 8 15:50:44 2015 UTC,"A lot of viewers were confused by it until DeKnight cleared it up. Nobu essentially killed himself, so Matt had no reason to be conflicted over it. Besides, Nobu could have totally jumped into the water to save himself like Matt did, but he just kept on fighting."
Daredevil,38yp5d,AwesomePocket,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:10:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe Matt did not give the final blow or intentionally set him on fire but he is responsible for Nobu's death. He is very much the main reason he's dead, so normally he should feel at least some kind of responsibility for that death."
Daredevil,38yp5d,Semiramis42,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:39:57 2015 UTC,"Matt didn't cause his death. When Nobu attacked, Matt blocked with the stick and the hook coincidentally knocks the stick into the light. Think about it like this: In Spider-Man, when Peter dodges Norman's glider and it impales the Goblin, is Spider-Man responsible for that death?"
Daredevil,38yp5d,AwesomePocket,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:20:30 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, I really do. I am not saying that Matt is at fault or that he is a killer but ... I do think that Matt is responsible to some extent for Nobu's death and for someone so religious and moral and afraid of killing, I would have expected him to at least show some kind of guilt that someone was actually dead because of him."
Daredevil,38yp5d,Semiramis42,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:29:56 2015 UTC,I think Nobu isn't dead but maybe thats just me... meditative state to survive...  Also wasn't it cool that he kept attacking AFTER being on fire I thought that was a nice touch.
Daredevil,38yp5d,shnnrr,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:52:58 2015 UTC,"I think your very last point is the biggest one for me. Baldy and the gang interrupt the scene. I'd like to imagine that if they were never there, that DD would have tried to save Nobu's life."

In my opinion it seemed like it was always on Fisk's mind after he found out) because Karen was upset with what she had done. Think about her face once the realization hit.  Then she got rid of the gun, went home, and got incredibly drunk.  She took a shower to try to wash off her actions.  Then when she talked to Foggy he said ""You can't run around killing people and call yourself a human being"".  That really hurt her because it hadn't even been a full day since killing a man.  Obviously she wouldn't go and tell people about what she had done.  To me it seemed like she really wanted to keep it a secret, understandably,  even though deep down inside she knows that it will eventually come out.  As for the suit part: I like the red suit as a prototype.  As I've stated multiple times in this sub, Melvin Potter said it wasn't finished yet (His exact words were something like ""I haven't had time to put all of it through the process yet"" iirc), so we can assume that it will be edited at some point during season 2, maybe even into season 3.

Daredevil,38mky2,YouthoughtIwaserious,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:58:26 2015 UTC,I actually don't think it's a good idea to cast him as Bullseye because it means Bullseye won't be appearing that much in the season due to how expensive he is. I would much rather have him be a really strong villain in one episode so maybe later he could appear in a Marvel movie for example.

Daredevil,38mf8h,BadPasswordGuy,2,Fri Jun 5 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"Something I like about the character is that the most interesting storytelling hinges on conflict, and his internal struggle between different notions of what's ""right"" is a big conflict for him to deal with.  Even aside the religious aspect, he's a lawyer, he works within the law - and then the law didn't work.  He had to give up some of his self-identity to become a vigilante, but he'd have to give up a lot more to become a murderer."

He agonizes over whether or not to kill Fisk, tries to but fails, and then agonizes some more about what he was willing to do and about whether or not he should try again, or try to take him down non-lethally instead. He and his priest spend all kinds of time talking about it.  Not mentioned at all?  The fact that he totally murdered the hell of of Nobu. He drenched him in gasoline, lit him on fire, and then left him to die a lingering death without ever lifting a finger to save him.

While he no longer can see, the radioactive exposure heightens his remaining sense""  Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_%28Marvel_Comics%29"
Daredevil,38hkyl,autowikibot,3,Thu Jun 4 07:35:52 2015 UTC,"Daredevil (Marvel Comics):       Daredevil is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, with an unspecified amount of input from Jack Kirby,  and first appeared in Daredevil #1 (April 1964).  Living in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York City, Matt Murdock is blinded by a radioactive substance that falls from an oncoming vehicle. While he no longer can see, the radioactive exposure heightens his remaining senses beyond normal human ability and gives him a type of sonar which acts as his vision. His father, a boxer named Jack Murdock, supports him as he grows up, though Jack is later killed by gangsters after refusing to throw a fight. After donning a yellow and dark red costume (later all dark red), Matt seeks out revenge against his father's killers as the superhero Daredevil, fighting against his many enemies, including Bullseye and the Kingpin.  He also becomes a lawyer. Daredevil's nickname is ""the Man Without Fear"".   While Daredevil had been home to the work of comic-book artists such as Everett, Kirby, Wally Wood, John Romita, Sr., and Gene Colan, among others, Frank Miller's influential tenure on the title in the early 1980s did as much to cement the character as a popular and influential part of the Marvel Universe. Daredevil has since appeared in various forms of media including several animated series, video games and merchandise, and the 2003 feature-length film Daredevil, where he was portrayed by Ben Affleck. Charlie Cox plays Daredevil in Marvel's Daredevil live-action television series.

Daredevil,38hkyl,lets_duel,7,Thu Jun 4 07:35:59 2015 UTC,"the show explicitly states it is the chemicals. When the priest says he knows murdock is the man in the mask but doesn't know how, murdock says the chemicals gave him special abilities."
Daredevil,38hkyl,pmarkland,6,Thu Jun 4 08:50:10 2015 UTC,"Ok, so if it was the chemicals, was Stick (Scott Glenn) affected by the same chemicals?"
Daredevil,38hkyl,Gav-El,2,Thu Jun 4 14:46:05 2015 UTC,Stick was blind when he was born I believe
Daredevil,38hkyl,pmarkland,5,Thu Jun 4 14:48:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, but it seems like Stick has the same heightened senses as Murdoch. How did he acquire them?"
Daredevil,38hkyl,darkpassenger9,10,Thu Jun 4 15:03:03 2015 UTC,"In the comics Stick has heightened senses because he's like a mystical mentor character. He's studied martial arts, including the spiritual side of it, all his life. However his senses are not typically depicted as being anywhere near Matt Murdock.   In the show they chose to make Stick just as powerful as Matt with no explanation. Perhaps they'll give us one later."
Daredevil,38hkyl,NoForceOnEarth,3,Thu Jun 4 17:02:57 2015 UTC,"I think the point is that, although Stick doesn't have the superpowers Matt does, he was able to acquire the same abilities through a sheer combination of intelligence, giftedness, practice and discipline. That's what makes this fictional world dangerous: anyone, like Bullseye, can do that. (Remember that Bullseye has no superpowers, either, and yet he proves more threatening than the countless villains who do.) Matt's accident simply gives him the opportunity to enter the ring—not own it."
Daredevil,38hkyl,lakattack0221,2,Sun Jun 7 14:38:24 2015 UTC,I always wondered the same thing
Daredevil,38hkyl,The_Hare,2,Thu Jun 4 16:00:39 2015 UTC,"Murdock has more of a Super power than Stick. If you go back and read the ""year One' type story of Daredevil, which the series really adheres to, you realize, Daredevil is really a super-hero and surpasses Stick's level really quickly. In the series, he should have kicked Stick's ass easily because he has sonar which isn't really explained in the TV series"

Daredevil,38d78t,fuzzypoop,3,Wed Jun 3 15:31:09 2015 UTC,"Yea I mean I think he is totally blind but the directors were probably like, ""Ok now to see in his vision make everything red or black...... no no no that looks fucking stupid, let's make it more interesting!"""
Daredevil,38d78t,SneakyTigers,10,Wed Jun 3 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"He is probably completely blind in the ""his eyes don't work at all"" sense.  However, blind people who use echolocation (this is actually a thing people do, though obviously not to the degree on TV) to navigate have been studied via MRI machines.  The part of the brain that seeing people use to make a 3D model of the world is the same part that lights up for blind people using echolocation.  So, it's not ""seeing,"" but it's using some of the same bits of the brain that seeing people use, so maybe it's sort of seeing?"
Daredevil,38d78t,BadPasswordGuy,2,Wed Jun 3 19:48:59 2015 UTC,"This. It has been confirmed that the visual cortex remains active and adapts to process information for blind people who are able to develop echolocation abilities.

Daredevil,38baa1,Morty_And_Rick,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:52:33 2015 UTC,I was considering that too. Or maybe it's a conspiracy and the foreshadowing will just continue to get more and more intense until one episodes ends with Bullseye smirking.
Daredevil,38baa1,Morty_And_Rick,3,Wed Jun 3 04:07:59 2015 UTC,The universe of the show is different so maybe Bullseye is somehow related to Jack's death. Maybe Bullseye was trained by the killer or knew the killer some how.
Daredevil,38baa1,SPWatwin,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:56:49 2015 UTC,That's possible. I'm so excited for when Bullseye makes an appearance. (IMO) He seems like such a cool dude to chill with if he wasn't trying to kill you. Kind of like Ninja Brian from Ninja Sex Party.

As soon as Stick starts to realize the kind of things Matt is surrounding himself with (i.e., nice, yuppie, comfortable, expensive stuff), he does a quick mental arithmetic, then guesses what kind of beer a guy like that would drink: ""I bet it's that German piss."" I don't think he actually knew what kinds of beers Matt would drink; he took a guess based on what he assumes about Matt's personality, and he happens to be right."

I think they did it that way because they wanted it to look like a helmet, like something a superhero that didn't have the benefit of being a super soldier or a Norse God might wear to protect his head.   Considering the tone of the rest of the show, they probably felt a little self conscious about the costume finally showing up, so they really went out of their way to justify it as armor. Like he doesn't dress up because he thinks it's cool, he dresses up because his costume functions as a suit of armor that protects him, and the whole ""Devil"" motif is just a bonus to make him seem otherworldly to criminals.   That being said, it looks really fucking stupid. Not that he wears a red suit with horns at all, just this particular version of it. They could have done a better job making it look practical and realistic without it looking so silly and dopey. It's the one thing the 2004 Daredevil film did better than this show. I'm confident they'll hear the feedback and fix it for season 2.  However, to all the people saying ""he should just go back to the black mask"": that's silly and unproductive, because then it's not fucking Daredevil. It reminds me of that story Kevin Smith tells of Jon Peters, the producer who wanted to make a Superman movie without the blue outfit and red cape because ""it looks too faggy."""
Daredevil,37zqbr,darkpassenger9,12,Mon Jun 1 02:25:50 2015 UTC,This is what I hope they try and go for next season  or this
Daredevil,37zqbr,nerfAvari,6,Mon Jun 1 07:18:39 2015 UTC,"My vote definitely goes for that second one. I like the darker colors, and it's more consistent with the whole thing with his costume primarily being an armor suit"
Daredevil,37zqbr,ShaolinShade,9,Mon Jun 1 14:22:41 2015 UTC,The black mask made him look like the Dread Pirate Roberts.
Daredevil,37zqbr,platypuspracticus,16,Mon Jun 1 08:46:13 2015 UTC,Because the suit maker wasn't finished making the suit. It was incomplete.
Daredevil,37zqbr,CamTheGringo,11,Sun May 31 23:47:16 2015 UTC,"Good point actually, it will give them the chance to justify a different suit if season 2 has a new one."
Daredevil,37zqbr,indistructo,9,Mon Jun 1 03:35:55 2015 UTC,Hell ya I expect season 2s suit to be fucking epic. Something like this.   http://comic-book-statues-and-busts.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/daredevil-lifesize-bust-sideshow-collectibles.jpg
Daredevil,37zqbr,CamTheGringo,8,Mon Jun 1 04:36:47 2015 UTC,"I've seen this complaint here and there, and I think I know what everyone's talking about: something about the design of the mask combined with Charlie Cox's mouth and jaw makes him look a little dopey. I don't know exactly why it does, but it does. Hopefully it'll get some work before that second season shoots."
Daredevil,37zqbr,MacBeth_in_Yellow,3,Mon Jun 1 00:31:37 2015 UTC,I think they'll tweak the mask in the offseason.
Daredevil,37zqbr,wiccabilly,5,Sun May 31 23:09:15 2015 UTC,"Same here, I liked him much better with the old outfit. I'm usually not a fan of superhero movies/shows, I think because the costumes make it feel cheesy and over the top. The last scenes in his costume felt like that, even though the action was pretty much the same as it had been throughout the season."

That being said the way I saw it was twofold. First, the show tends not to present us, the viewer, with the whole story. I think some things happened off screen we don't quite get to see that make the announcement work. Second, I basically think people cared because he announced like a major real estate redevelopment effort for Hells Kitchen. Basically I think he said he was going to buy up significant parts of Hells Kitchen and turn it into something new."

Daredevil,37slqz,Arctic-Elx,5,Sat May 30 01:52:26 2015 UTC,"That would be a cool spin furthering the deduction, but really there are so many blind people around (Gao's ring specifically) that I doubt his carelessness with his walking sticks are more than just to show his sense of urgency and dropping appearances. Though, I wouldn't be disappointed if it was part of his being discovered! But it's like the equivalent of Superman leaving his glasses behind in a phonebooth. Though, I guess more specific and narrowed down. Maybe he'll even stop being so careless with disposing of them, I guess we'll find out soon enough!"

Daredevil,37slqz,ColinScatt,6,Sat May 30 03:41:08 2015 UTC,"movies and TV shows are loaded with examples of things which may (or should) be happening, but we just don't see it because it would interrupt the flow or storytelling or be otherwise uneccessary. the guy's smart, I assume he has a decent memory, there's no reason to show him going back and picking up each cane he's dropped, and there's no reason to assume he doesn't go back and pick them up. out of each character's 24-hour day, how many of those hours do we see? how many things could be happening during those unseen hours which would explain questions like this? I know there's the possibility it could be a plot point as a discarded cane gets found and causes him trouble, but I don't think he's that careless, making this basically a non-issue."

Daredevil,37vnwo,fwambo42,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:33:29 2015 UTC,"yeah the old lady dying specifically was really bad. like, why would any grown man honestly have a breakdown over some random old lady he just met?"
Daredevil,37vnwo,-California,3,Wed Jun 3 00:46:53 2015 UTC,"I think his breakdown was partly due to the death but mostly due to the realization that while Nelson and Murdock fought for the good using the law, Fisk was able to destroy all of that progress so easily with violence. I say this because when Karen spoke with him while he was broken down at the bar, he primarily spoke about how fighting for good as a lawyer was pointless. Just my 2 cents but I thought it was bad acting or over exaggeration at first but seeing that he found his life choices pointless (he gave up the good lawyer job to have the meaningful job) I'd be depressed just the same."
Daredevil,37vnwo,toyskins,9,Sat Jun 6 08:09:41 2015 UTC,"Watching him in this felt like I was watching someone try to read lines, not act. Honestly every scene he was in ruined the immersion for me."

Daredevil,37s3qc,TheTacomaGuy,34,Fri May 29 23:03:35 2015 UTC,"My take is that Fisk is a man who is constantly struggling with his demons and fighting to stay in control.  The way he speaks is a reflection of that.  He is very concerned with how he appears to others and he overthinks everything, including what he says.  Those weird pauses, to me, seem to be him constantly thinking of different ways to say things before he chooses what he is actually going to say.  And, sometimes, it is him slowing himself down to keep his anger in check.  That was my take on his weird way of speaking.  I thought it fit with how they are portraying his character."
Daredevil,37s3qc,BranWafr,3,Sat May 30 19:15:49 2015 UTC,Fully. Yep. And like he's not used to using an outside voice.

Daredevil,37s3qc,Bruce_Crayne,3,Sat May 30 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"That could be it. A lot of people who get used to the same acting method that an actor does could change the way they view said actor in a different method of acting. For instance, Kevin Costner is a fantastic actor, and he does a good job in most things because of the writing and how he acts, but in 3 Days to Kill, he was awful. Yes, he was the best part of the movie, but it was still bad.  Also, a lot of it has to do with the writing. I've not seen law and order, but I feel like Wilson Fisk and whoever D'onofrio plays in LaO, are written outside of the regular feel you see him at."
Daredevil,37s3qc,Arctic-Elx,1 point,Sat May 30 01:28:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed, yeah he plays a good detective but has OCD very clean. Hand sanitizer etc. Completely opposite."
Daredevil,37s3qc,Arctic-Elx,7,Sat May 30 01:35:20 2015 UTC,"I think the voice seems weirdly strained, too.  I don't know how I'd prefer it...  But it sounds like he struggles to get each sentence out.  I feel like maybe it's to emphasize that Fisk is kind of a mousey fat kid still."
Daredevil,37s3qc,LordOfTheGeese,1 point,Sat May 30 01:34:17 2015 UTC,I hadn't thought of that! His normal voice isnt bad but its not intimidating either. That actually makes a lot of sense.
Daredevil,37s3qc,Beatnick,2,Sat May 30 01:39:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I dunno, he sounds like he's struggling to speak and the only reason for that that came to mind would be if he's trying to seem like someone naturally kinda timid.    Might be an intimidation thing, too, though, haha, who knows"
Daredevil,37s3qc,HonkHorn,3,Sat May 30 01:54:07 2015 UTC,"He's playing Fisk differently to Michael Clark Duncan and that's a good thing, Fisk isn't a cartoonish brute anymore, he's much scarier once he has something or someone to fight for, D'Onofrio portrays a strong but deeply broken man with internal conflicts, rather than a smooth talking roided out dude."
Daredevil,37s3qc,kidnapalm,2,Fri May 29 23:55:45 2015 UTC,I think his expressions and mannerisms are spot on and he plays the character well but the voice really ruins it for me. It sounds like hes trying to hard or something. I don't know I can't really put my finger on it.
Daredevil,37s3qc,bennybunny25,0,Sat May 30 00:31:49 2015 UTC,"I've honestly never thought Vincent d'onofrio was a very good actor. Sort of felt he lucked out on Full Metal Jacket, he didn't have many lines and SK probably new exactly what he needed for the part. But I don't hate his performance in Daredevil. I don't think he's gonna win a golden globe or anything, but I respect it. I think it's an interesting character."
Daredevil,37s3qc,TheExtremistModerate,2,Sat May 30 02:33:37 2015 UTC,HOLY SHIT I KNEW HE LOOKED LIKE PRIVATE PYLE. Thought he was too young to be him. My God this makes so much sense. He killed Gunny no wonder I don't like him.
Daredevil,37s3qc,violetmemphisblue,3,Sat May 30 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"Not me as I really like the acting of D'Onofrio. The way he almost pressed words out of his mouth when he was angry. Him beating up some unlucky persons or giving orders to kill adversaries. On the other hand that thing with Vanessa, admitting that he's not used to hanging around with women. The morning routine that looked like everybody else's. I think he created a very interesting, complex Kingpin that actually made me want to watch the 1st season to its end. Without D'Onofrio's acting I would have passed after the first few episodes."
Daredevil,37s3qc,BlankPages,3,Wed Jun 3 10:18:31 2015 UTC,"I genuinely think he is trying to portray him as a guy with Asperger's or mild-medium level Autism. Makes sense with his intense focus, wild mood swings, poor social skills, childish self-belief he is doing good despite being a monster...perhaps it's showing how such supposed disabilities in a civilised, ""well-adjusted"" society could actually be profitable qualities amongst the criminal element if the individual was subject to the childhood traumas Fisk experienced."
Daredevil,37s3qc,Inkus,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:35:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i definitely agree. as i was watching, i noticed his speaking patterns and how even in simple conversations his tone would be off. it caught my eye (or ear rather). I think D'Onofrio did it on purpose to show that because of the childhood dramas, he never fully coped with them and move past them and in the long run developed some kind of mental condition. He did a marvelous job portraying that."
Daredevil,37s3qc,wolfJam,2,Sun Jun 7 04:25:06 2015 UTC,"Personally, he seems like he is socially awkward. He says things like ""I'm not really comfortable being in the public eye,"" or ""I don't do this often"" when he meets Vanessa, or stuff like that. It feels like despite being a man obsessed with power and control, his people skills are... lacking. He seems like a bit of a man-child. He's incredibly prone to rage: throwing tantrums whenever something bad happens to him and taking it out on whoever is around him. He's very idealistic. He's very emotional. And the way he speaks, it sounds like he's speaking how he thinks someone who would be in control should speak.  I think all this is on purpose, and I'd like to ask D'onofrio if he acted this way to convey this, or if it's for some other reason entirely."

Daredevil,37dnh3,GreenAvoro,33,Tue May 26 21:30:49 2015 UTC,"The black suit fit the aesthetic and tone of the series.  It was cheap, got torn up easily, and didn't make him any kind of superhuman.  Which made perfect sense -- this guy is the son of a boxer who lost as much as he won, and yes, his superpower is sort of excellent hearing and sense of smell, but it's also sort of that he's got a rage so deep he'll brain a guy with a microwave and then trip over a broken door he can't see.  It just made sense for him to have a standing order with Amazon for four black long-sleeve shirts a week, because they get torn up.  But it also wasn't going to work to have him unarmored forever.  He was getting beaten up badly on a regular basis.  That was one of the best aspects of the show, but it was going to strain credibility eventually.  He was already breaking a few ribs one night and beating up 11 guys the next night as if that hadn't happened.  If the show maintained a tone of realism, then realistically, he'd have needed two months off to recuperate after the fight with Nobu.  They had to get him some sort of protection going forward.  I just hope they can refashion it for season 2 so that it doesn't look quite so...silly.  The whole 'Devil of Hell's Kitchen' idea could work, but it has to be subtle, and the point of the costume, I think, needs to clearly be so that he can take a punch with a little less pain."
Daredevil,37dnh3,autojourno,8,Wed May 27 03:52:20 2015 UTC,"That was one thing I liked about Arrow. I'm marathoning the show now, and in his toughest fight (broke a few ribs and more), he's said to taken 6 weeks off before resuming action."
Daredevil,37dnh3,xodus112,7,Wed May 27 16:00:24 2015 UTC,"It's clear that he needed protection, but based on what the tailor did for Fisk's business suits, it's also clear that he could have Matt's old style clothes with protection.  I dislike the super hero-y suit not just because it looks dorky, but more because it takes away the possibility of just looking like a regular guy walking down the street. But maybe that's gone anyway. Hell's Kitchen is not all that big."
Daredevil,37dnh3,Inkus,22,Wed May 27 23:22:23 2015 UTC,"Even though I didn't like the black suit in the promo shots, the moment I saw him wearing it I fell in love with it.  Not so much with the red suit. The concept art looks nice, but I don't like the way the suit is made. The mesh fabric seems so generic now. If Fisk can have a regular suit made with Potter's reinforced fabric, why can't Matt get a suit that looks like something normal, skin-tight, instead of the now overused faux-leather with a mesh texture. That was innovative 15 years ago, now - not so much. I'd honestly prefetr the suit to look more like the black suit repainted red.  As for the new mask - it just look terrible. It seems that when it's applied to Charlie Cox's head everything seems off. I actually grew fond of the black mask, even if it didn't look anything like the comicbook one. And I loved the fact he had his eyes covered. Sure, when we all know Matt's blind it screams ""Blind guy!"" to us. But to some thug getting his ass kicked? No one would think ""Hmm, this guy probably can't see,"" it would just look menacing, like there's something otherworldly about Daredevil. Personally, I'd like if they just slapped some horns on the black mask and made it red, but I know the covered nose is a subject of much controversy in this subreddit :D"
Daredevil,37dnh3,MauriceEscargot,3,Wed May 27 09:52:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was my exact thought about his mask, when people saw it they would think what the hell are you? Like he's an actual demon or something."
Daredevil,37dnh3,I-DragonBorn,2,Wed May 27 16:59:12 2015 UTC,"No one would think ""Hmm, this guy probably can't see,"" it would just look menacing, like there's something otherworldly about Daredevil.   My mind immediately jumps to Karl Urban in Dredd. Not once does he take off his helmet and let you see his eyes, and that makes him incredibly intimidating."
Daredevil,37dnh3,TriumphantBass,58,Thu May 28 01:27:19 2015 UTC,"I prefer him in the black outfit, but only because his suit is so darn tacky."

Daredevil,37dnh3,eec003,23,Wed May 27 00:38:20 2015 UTC,"I find that I'm in the minority, in that I LOVE the red suit and really didn't like the black suit at all.  The black suit was a little too generic, dread pirate roberts/zorro for me, and the way it covered his eyes basically screamed LOOK AT ME IM A BLIND GUY.  I have pretty much no complaints about the red suit other than I wish we'd gotten it sooner and that we could have had a few more shots of it in brighter lighting."
Daredevil,37dnh3,CypressJoker,24,Tue May 26 22:40:15 2015 UTC,I liked the red suit but not the mask. I think it all needs a bit of work in the offseason but I'm confident they'll have it ironed out by S02E01.
Daredevil,37dnh3,wiccabilly,8,Tue May 26 22:49:55 2015 UTC,"The mask took me a little getting used to, and I realized it's because his nose is covered, whereas in the comics it isnt.  While it kind of gives him a pig nose look in some shots, I think it's a solid change, particularly because of how much more visceral the show is than the rest of the MCU.  Matt could easily get his nose bashed in by a skilled enough human opponent, so having a bit more face protection is a good call.  Show Matt and comics Matt are on very different power levels.  Comics Matt can go toe-to-toe with Captain America for a bit, whereas I'm confident that MCU Cap would roll over show Matt with relative ease."
Daredevil,37dnh3,CypressJoker,6,Tue May 26 22:54:44 2015 UTC,They definitely express his human element in the Netflix series.
Daredevil,37dnh3,TheRedCack,7,Wed May 27 08:56:25 2015 UTC,As they should. It's hard when writing comics to take a super hero who isn't supposed to have super human strength or agility then try to line them up with other characters who do.   I've never really liked Daredevil for mainly that reason in the comics.
Daredevil,37dnh3,trebory6,3,Wed May 27 13:12:36 2015 UTC,MCU Cap could also roll over comics Cap/Daredevil with ease. He got the Ultimate upgrade package.
Daredevil,37dnh3,latticusnon,3,Thu May 28 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"This is true, but it's important to note that MCU Daredevil did not receive a similar upgrade and is arguably weaker than his comic book counterpart."
Daredevil,37dnh3,CypressJoker,2,Thu May 28 21:59:11 2015 UTC,"The nose thing is spot on. Also they cover the side of his face more with black, so the face we do see now is sorta glaring feeling.  They eyes feel like some kind of Batman costume too.  Not that Ben Afleck's costume was better, but just seeing more neck helped it http://www.ew.com/sites/default/files/styles/tout_image_612x380/public/i/2015/04/09/daredevil-elektra.jpg  The body suit was fine, it's just the neck/mask that needs work."
Daredevil,37dnh3,WoozleWuzzle,4,Thu Jun 18 20:46:59 2015 UTC,I think I'd like something better in between the two. Black suit is too boring boring his red suit is a bit corny.
Daredevil,37dnh3,bicepts,7,Wed May 27 04:29:53 2015 UTC,The black one had more of a ninja vibe and seems more useful for camouflage at night
Daredevil,37dnh3,sxehoneybadger,4,Wed May 27 01:13:41 2015 UTC,"I think a red version of the black suit would have been perfect.  And the final mask was a bit too helmet-like.  I guess it makes sense, he's gonna need armour in a universe populated by villains with super strength and whatnot but I agree, the fluidity of his movement in the black suit really emphasised how well-trained he was."
Daredevil,37dnh3,RedBeardofDoom,3,Wed May 27 10:41:14 2015 UTC,"I expect an updated version of the suit for season 2 as Matt has adapted to how it moves.  The final fight seen may have seemed clunky but given that he just got the suit I would be suprised if the writers didn't take that into account when they coreagraphed that fight.  As for the black being a cool suit- sure it looked good, but it was clear that Matt needed to up his game and his equipment if he wanted to make a difference at the level he wanted.  Nobu almost killed him- heck he almost died at the start of episode 2.  If he stuck with his black outfit it was only a matter of time before it killed him."
Daredevil,37dnh3,JoeyJoJoShabadoJr,1 point,Wed May 27 15:40:26 2015 UTC,"The argument is to keep the black style but in reinforced fabric. Rather than the red look, horns etc.  I can see the argument for both. The Winter Soldier moved pretty well in his get up which allegedly had a lot of Kevlar enforced fabric etc. could have done something like that, perhaps with some kind of chest etc. armor, essentially keep the same mask. Maybe done it all on a dark red. Cut eye holes and cover them in scrim to hide Matts lack of gaze."
Daredevil,37dnh3,Techsupportvictim,3,Sat May 30 04:14:59 2015 UTC,The stunt guy was incredible. anything that detracts from that power and grace needs to go. the suit needs to be red and skin tight like the comic books.
Daredevil,37dnh3,sweetgrasssmoke,4,Wed May 27 18:12:58 2015 UTC,"I actually kinda do. When I saw him in the suit, I feel like it's made out of some type of rubbery material that would definitely slow him down."

You just know you can jump in the air and you would not come back down until you wanna. The details aren't important. You don't have other powers, so if you fly too fast or too high your body can't handle it, and most importantly, if you fly in broad daylight you will be seen. You have no way to camouflage yourself. Would you really go out and fly right now? Would you want the world to know? Or would you try to find some way to fly without bringing attention to yourself? Have you any idea the consequences of people seeing you defying gravity? How much your life would change in less than a day? a week? How many different kinds of people would respond in a myriad number of ways? Some wanting to befriend you, some wanting to dissect you, some wanting to manipulate you, and some people just wanting to use you as target practice for the lulz. And other ppl I can't even imagine how they'd react. Sometimes good but more often than not, the human reactions to a fellow human doing something decidedly not human would be quite unpleasant.   The black suit was more believable. In reality, a night street fighter would not want to bring attention to himself. A red costume with horns would be something a person would wear only if they're expecting to be videotaped or otherwise have an audience. It's one of the many problems MCU and other modern day live action ""superhero"" films have. How do you use the comic book costume idea convincingly? cuz the closer to reality you get, the less believable superheroes appear. If you didn't want people to know your identity, you don't put on a mask, cuz that's just asking people to try and figure out who you are.   FOX never put Wolverine in yellow spandex for a reason. It just wouldn't work. Yellow is simply not Jackman's color. Same goes here. Charlie Cox didn't pull off the suit at the end, and he shouldn't have been expected to do so this early in the series. Maybe ever.   I honestly can't believe a blind man with stealthy ninja training would want to wear a bright red devil suit. The black outfit in most of the series is much more functional and inconspicuous. They should not have ended the first season with that. It seemed like a rush afterthought to bring that guy who made Kingpin's suits into the last couple eps. They needed to come up with a more organic way of introducing the suit."
Daredevil,37dnh3,Zock123454321,6,Wed May 27 03:09:21 2015 UTC,"He wanted to be a symbol. They said that, and they hinted on him being the devil multiple times.

Daredevil,37dnh3,wilyquixote,5,Wed May 27 14:18:47 2015 UTC,"FOX never put Wolverine in yellow spandex for a reason. It just wouldn't work.   I'm surprised that this ridiculous paradigm is still being bandied about.  I was sure this foolishness was killed dead.   FOX never put Wolverine in yellow spandex because, like so many superhero movies before them, the FOX movies have always been at least kind of ashamed about superhero conventions.    But following the first Matrix-inspired X-Men movie, we got Raimi's Spider-Man and all its gleeful embracing of the silver age.  And Marvel Studios took that ball and ran with it and proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that pure, classic superheroes in all their trappings can and do work on the big screen.  And often work better than all the ashamed, downplayed, watered-down superhero movies that idiot, money-grubbing executives with no understanding of the property tried to slough off on the public.     If you think that a classically outfitted Wolverine wouldn't work, I have to remind you that we're all watching a series of movies that will culminate with a flying, caped viking and a talking raccoon with a machine gun squaring off against a muscular purple alien with a glove full of power jewels.  And these movies will make billions of dollars.  But yellow isn't Jackman's color?  Man..."
Daredevil,37dnh3,ZachsMind,6,Wed May 27 06:19:55 2015 UTC,I can't think of a suitable rebuttal. Kudos on a well written and reasoned response. I bow to your superior position on this issue (but have you SEEN Jackman in yellow? Ew.)
Daredevil,37dnh3,TriumphantBass,2,Wed May 27 12:45:10 2015 UTC,"I honestly could never grasp how Wolverine ever wore that costume in the first place. Even in the comics, it didn't seem like it fit with his character.  First Class had the bright yellow spandex for the entire team, and I thought they executed it perfectly. That being said, I feel like Wolverine's cameo was also executed perfectly and completely in character.  It's just my opinion. I really like the look of the comics suit, but I've never seen it as suiting him."

Daredevil,37flvt,ChocolatePain,9,Wed May 27 07:19:25 2015 UTC,"I do wish we'd had more of Wesley.  I think they way he died was clever, but like...  It should've been Karen.  She's just really annoying IMO and her subplot took away from the show for me. I didn't notice Leland in the scene...  I think it's old-white-dudes-looking-alike syndrome, tbh.  Would be interesting if he were, though. It seemed like gentrification.  I mean, booting people from rent-controlled apartments isn't good...  I couldn't really tell what bad stuff he was up to and what good stuff he claimed to be doing, either, to be honest.  It was all kind of vague to me, too ^ ;; I assume the farm he was sent to was sitting on oil, lol. I think it could be echo-location-y, or like a smell/wind thing or something.  I mean, if Stick could tell the different components of ice cream without any apparent chemically-enhanced senses, I guess Matt is able to detect buildings? Vanessa basically said at some point that she finds his power hot, or something, if I recall.  I think she enjoys the combination of like, fixer-upper and kingpin that is Wilson Fisk.  We don't really know much about her besides that she's banged princes before, so she might have sketchy morals as well.  (Maybe all of those abstracts she sells are forged :P )"

Daredevil,37flvt,NPPraxis,4,Wed May 27 13:33:24 2015 UTC,"Also, wasn't Leland in the scene where they asked Jack Murdock to throw the fight or am I imagining that?   I don't think so, but it's been a few weeks since I've seen the series. I can't see Leland getting into the inner workings of the business like this. He's more of a behind the scenes kind of guy.   Anyway, what exactly was Fisk doing? It seemed like he was trying to do gentrification at worst? XD Why did he need the drug thing and other stuff? To funnel money? Where did he get the money/power from in the first place?   The drugs and cars were the illicit part of his operations and most likely the source of bribes for all the cops, judges and city officials. These funds as well as the funds from government contracts (via United Allied, the legal front for Fisk's operations) were laundered by Owlsley in order to help ""rebuild"" Hell's Kitchen, which was devastated in the wake of the Chitauri invasion. Those who stayed in Hell's kitchen after the invasion were mostly the working poor who couldn't afford to move, and didn't fit Fisk's vision of the city, so he made their lives living hell by letting crime run rampant and lowering property values and refusing even the most basic of maintenance on the properties themselves. In return, Fisk promised those who helped him a foothold in the city, either control over drugs in the area, property deals, etc.   I'm sure someone here might be able to allude more into Kingpin's past and his connections to Asia via the comics, but as far as I know in the show it is alluded that Fisk eliminated the mob from Hell's Kitchen entirely.  As another user posted, Matt has echolocation in addition to a variety of super-sensory abilities."

This whole scene was pretty out of character for him, he was far more emotional but still seemed in control.   Then, when she grabbed the gun, he barely seemed upset.  He almost nonchalantly states ""do you think I would be that stupid?"" then gets shot multiple times in the chest.  Bulletproof vest, anyone?  Squibs?

Daredevil,37dqwr,31425364Y,8,Sat May 30 19:59:48 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I think he'll stay dead, and the show might've killed him off because he was obviously the most fun to watch and if he outlived Fisk he'd have to become a villain in his own right, and killing him off would sort of add credibility.  Like, if they'll kill him off abruptly just because he had a lapse of judgement leaving a gun on the table, who is safe?   But yeah, I wish they'd've killed off Karen.  I honestly can't stand her, and my patience for Foggy is pretty minimal at this point, too.  I started skipping scenes they're both in..."

That company was a decoy and a piece of the Wilson Fisk puzzle. In the file was proof that money laundering was happening.  At least that is the way I understood everything.
Daredevil,37caru,underclass4,2,Tue May 26 16:34:12 2015 UTC,But your not supposed to say the name of my employer until like ep 5
Daredevil,37caru,PM_me_yo_chesticles,3,Tue May 26 21:18:13 2015 UTC,"Fisk was using Union Allied, the construction company Karen worked for, to launder money. Karen found proof of this when she was accidentally emailed the ""real"" ledger and the numbers were way off compared to the ""official"" ledger."
Daredevil,37caru,EveryGoodNameIsGone,3,Tue May 26 21:01:28 2015 UTC,"Union Allied Construction. It's a shell construction company used to launder money for Wilson Fisk. After ""The Incident"" (Avengers) a bunch of new construction companies popped up due to all the damage to the city. Karen was a secretary (or paralegal maybe?) for the company and stumbled upon some information she shouldn't have. Basically, using the ""pension fund"" of the construction company, Fisk was washing his drug money and spreading his influence throughout the city. Funny thing is though, they were making money off of the construction companies too. Leland (the money guy) said at one point ""who cares? every time they get knocked through a building, our profit goes up 3%"" or something like that. Can't really say much more than that without major spoilers."

Daredevil,37atbg,antihexe,14,Tue May 26 06:44:25 2015 UTC,"I think Vanessa is one of the more interesting characters on the show.  The show had several people who were wearing masks (literally and figuratively), and not only was she one of them, but she wore it the most seamlessly.  Fisk's mask was cracked from the first time we saw him, and Gao's mask was pretty thin (I don't think anyone expected her to just be an old Chinese lady), but Vanessa's mask is slowly peeled off in layers over the course of the show.  She's introduced as an attractive art saleswoman, a love interest for the villain.  At first it seems like she'll just be there to humanize Fisk and give him something other to talk about than ""this city"".  Then we get the Fight Club scene where they're watching buildings explode like most couples watch fourth of july fireworks or a sunset.  It's from that moment on that we see more and more of the person Vanessa really is - she's not just a sympathetic woman who can see past a man's flaws.  She's devious and cunning, and I think she went for Fisk because he was rich, stuck around because he was powerful, and only when he showed his devotion to her did she finally fall for him on a real emotional level.  Vanessa is just as much of a monster as any of the other villains on the show.  The difference is that she's the monster you don't see coming."
Daredevil,37atbg,CypressJoker,2,Tue May 26 22:46:40 2015 UTC,"Vanessa is just as much of a monster as any of the other villains on the show.   I don't know. I may be the odd one out here but I think mass murdering, drug running, crime god's are a little more monstrous than gold diggers."
Daredevil,37atbg,Greek___Geek,2,Fri May 29 14:05:05 2015 UTC,"Okay yeah that's fair, I'm guilty of hyperbole there, but I don't think she's just a gold digger.  I really think she was into the whole crimelord thing Fisk had going and encouraged him to really pursue the ""ill intent"" as it were.    She's not actively engaged in criminal activity, but she's certainly an accessory to all of those crimes and I'd bet she has it in her to be pretty goddamn dangerous."
Daredevil,37atbg,CypressJoker,1 point,Fri May 29 22:25:23 2015 UTC,I can agree with most of that. I don't think she'd be capable of carrying out any crimes though. I think she likes the idea of it so that is why she loves a man who does it for her.
Daredevil,37atbg,Greek___Geek,1 point,Sat May 30 12:00:23 2015 UTC,Hopefully that gets explored in later seasons either way.
Daredevil,37atbg,CypressJoker,12,Mon Jun 1 03:48:27 2015 UTC,"I would say that Vanessa is as attracted to power as Fisk is, and in him she sees that power. You have to remember that these are two wealthy, one-percent rich people. The first telling moment of Vanessa's character comes during their second dinner date. She's well aware of what Fisk is and says as much, but is still completely attracted to him and the idea that he will tear down the low class aspects of the city and gentrify it to accommodate people like him and Vanessa. He's protective of her and I'm sure she feels safe with him because of it. If not anything else, Fisk comes off pretty charming and genuine in his initial scenes with Vanessa.  While I do think her stance in the relationship could have been a little more fleshed out, her main purpose both in the comics and show is to serve as Fisk's weakness. It's worth noting that in the comics she isn't supportive of Fisk's criminal activity and pressures him to leave that lifestyle, which he actually does do for a brief period of time."
Daredevil,37atbg,Uncanny_Doom,4,Tue May 26 12:09:45 2015 UTC,"I thought this was a bit odd too. I haven't read the original comics in awhile but I remember her being more of a ""taming the beast"" type person who would bring out his human side. I could be remembering wrong though."
Daredevil,37atbg,_venkman,3,Tue May 26 17:16:11 2015 UTC,She humanizes Wilson for the audience. Don't you kind of find yourself rooting for Fisk early on in a bizarre way?
Daredevil,37atbg,BrainOfG,2,Tue May 26 21:05:58 2015 UTC,"I don't find her character believable at all. She seems written entirely in terms of what's useful to show about Fisk, not as a coherent character herself."
Daredevil,37atbg,Inkus,2,Wed May 27 23:28:57 2015 UTC,"She's up to something, I think they wrote her as somethings she's not to try and throw us off."
Daredevil,37atbg,FallenRiptide,2,Sun May 31 17:24:16 2015 UTC,I ain't sayin she a gold digger.  .  .  But this annoyed me a fair bit. I think by the end of the season she knows what Fisk is and the fact she decides to stay tells me she's equally ruthless.
Daredevil,37ae7n,Inkus,10,Tue May 26 04:06:45 2015 UTC,"Uh, yeah... I think you may be reading way too deep into their accents/linguistics. The writers don't instruct the actors how to speak or portray the characters. This is what the actors bring to the table in regard to bringing the characters to life. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't see how something like their accents would tell the viewer anything about their mothers.  Anyway- In the comics, Matt's mother is hinted as being a catholic nun."
Daredevil,37ae7n,sneechesgetsteetches,1 point,Tue May 26 04:25:59 2015 UTC,"Relatively minor comic spoilers below  Matts Mum in the comics was a nun. She abandoned him at a young age I think, and he only really met her during Born again, when he was recovering from a beating and she nursed him back to health. He asks her if she is his mum and she denies it, but he can hear that she is lying. She isn't really expanded upon to my knowlege, although I seem to recall that she featured in Kevin Smiths ""Guardian Devil"" story, as Bullseye tracks her down.  As to Matts accent... his dad managed to scrimp enough to put Matt through Law school. He would have been taught to speak like a lawyer there."
Daredevil,37ae7n,fench,4,Tue May 26 14:29:36 2015 UTC,"She was recently expanded upon in the comics in a really touching story that spun out of Marvel's Original Sin event.   COMICBOOK SPOILERS: Due to the events of Original Sin, Matt sees a vision of his father that paints him as a violent domestic abuser. He seeks out his mother to find out if his father, a hero and idol to Matt, was really a monster. In pursuing her he finds she's been arrested for vandalizing a military base, and is being illegally extradited to Wakanda. He eventually saves her, and reconnects. It turns out she left the family because she was suffering from an unusually extreme case of postpartum depression, and was a risk to herself and her family. The image of his father that Matt had seen was a reaction to a violent outburst from his mother and he hadn't hurt her himself. She had left and was searching for some way through her depression when she came across a convent and found some peace and sense of forgiveness with God. She became an activist nun, protesting pollution and the like. The story was universally acclaimed for the way it dealt with, and got a fair amount of attention.   It's included in the most recent trade Daredevil vol 2: West-Case Scenario, and the volume ends with another great story dealing with depression."

It's not a huge surprise that he might not have the local accent as an adult, some people are able to make that change. But what explains the childhood accent? That's why I was wondering about his mother's influence."
Daredevil,37ae7n,Techsupportvictim,1 point,Tue May 26 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"I got the impression that Dad wanted him to be well schooled. Perhaps he got Matt into private school. Maybe St Agnes had more than a day care. Might explain why he nagged Matt about homework so much. Good grades might be getting Matt a scholarship (I had one at that age for Catholic school). Add to that wanting him to get out of the poor life and become a doctor or lawyer or such.   At a school like that he would have been around lots of kids that didn't sound like a ""Mick""."
Daredevil,37ae7n,Arctic-Elx,1 point,Sat May 30 04:20:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's hard to find child actors that can do accents well, and I do think the writers are probably using accent as a lazy shorthand for education-level as well.  It might also have to do with the commentary on New York's changing image, or the gentrification of Hell's Kitchen.  New York accents are rarer and rarer in real life.  Who knows, I guess.  As far as Matt's mother, I don't think she seemed to be around enough to have influenced his accent."

Daredevil,373x6f,SolarFlar3,3,Sat May 30 01:50:03 2015 UTC,"I agree she's kindaof over-emotional at times.. but I think its more because she's so personally involved with the case and Fisk's men coming after her multiple times, etc. Her personality may change in the 2nd season who knows.

Daredevil,3792lc,TheUnitedSmeagol,2,Mon May 25 22:42:29 2015 UTC,"I think stupid is a poor word to describe it. The basis of a superhero is that they're going above and beyond what is normal to try to do good. It's explicitly made to look more difficult on Matt because when it comes to pain, he's as human as any of us. When it comes to being a hero, he's not the a rich billionaire that gets to sit on a big couch and wait for something extra threatening to respond to. He's the equivalent of a person working a 9 to 5 job. He goes out every night and it wears on him, but there's not really an alternative.  Personally I found the way this show displayed the everyday street level hero life to be pretty much perfect. It's something that doesn't get touched on enough. Also, I don't really see most of the trouble he has to come from lack of planning. Nobody would have expected the people working for Gao to willingly subdue someone at her command, for example."

Daredevil,36zkxi,ewewmjuilyh,15,Sun May 24 03:30:02 2015 UTC,"I think you should probably look at real DVD covers as research.  Why would there be comic book illustrations on cover for a TV show that doesn't reference them? You don't see Avengers movie posters with comic books all over them.  Fix the credits on the back. Why is everything on a separate line and centred? If you're going for a genuine cover, then you need to look at this. Again, look at how DVD covers actually look.  Reduce the size of the intro text and use something that's not a default font. Looks like you're using something like Candara currently. That has nothing to do with the TV show. Watch the opening and closing credits of the show and copy them.  Design has moved on from literally framing a screencap. Expand things, mask things, give everything more depth. Take a more layered approach.  Just take a bit more time to study real world DVD covers and you'll find some of the standards that are missing in your current design. You need to rework it, but not redesign it."

The. They would hav something similar for the bluray but add on a slip cover over it with a different design. Then for the extra special bluray package with behind the scenes and bonus footage and whatnot they would make a metal case that has more Braille and is the same red as the intro with a raised design similar to Matt from the intro footage."

Daredevil,36q1rt,chrismichaels3000,2,Thu May 21 05:36:08 2015 UTC,"We don't know the deal in the show. It's left vague intentionally, I assume.  In the comics he was bullied and did kill someone at the age of twelve, though it wasn't his father and thus, there is no farm that I know of. Being bullied in school gives him the idea that people are either going to be victims or they're going to have victims. Fisk makes it a point to learn about history and political science (among other things) growing up, and uses what he learned to get involved in controlling and uniting gangs. This goes on until Don Rigoletto (who is mentioned in the show) picks him up and makes him his right-hand man, but Fisk kills him and takes control of everything."
Daredevil,36l974,chrismichaels3000,9,Wed May 20 05:27:55 2015 UTC,"There's no confirmation for Madame Gao as of yet. However, because her heroin has the mark of Iron Fist villain Steel Serpent, people suspect she may be Crane Mother, another Iron Fist character. In any case it seems very likely she's related to all things Iron Fist.  We don't know much about Black Sky, but Nobu is part of The Hand. The Hand is a group of demon worshiping ninjas and typically anything they're dealing in will involve demonic/occult stuff. Stick is part of The Chaste which is basically the good ninja clan that opposes The Hand. The guy Stick was talking to is indeed credited as Stone, who in the comics was Stick's pupil and I think second in command. Stick is actually the Chaste's leader in the comics.  A note on Nobu: Nobu doesn't exist in the comics. Though it's possible Nobu is, or becomes Kirigi the Undying. Kirigi is an ancient warrior that the Hand resurrects constantly over time. Stick mentions that Nobu's gone by many names, and Nobu burns but tries to keep fighting. The latter of which is something that Kirigi does in very memorable fashion in the comics."

Daredevil,36grad,Doctor-Van-Nostrand,4,Tue May 19 18:19:19 2015 UTC,So what does that really mean?
Daredevil,36grad,hrhprincess,9,Tue May 19 18:25:53 2015 UTC,"It's about silent suffering from a constant feeling of guilt. Catholicism is so strict that Catholics feel they are constantly sinning, and so constantly feel guilty. It gets to the point where every hardship in life comes down to punishment for their sins. In the case of the show, Matt feels guilty for the death despite the fact it was completely not his fault because his Catholic guilt makes him think it's some kind of cruel punishment for his vigilantism."
Daredevil,36grad,Doctor-Van-Nostrand,9,Tue May 19 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"My mother in law always said, ""a little guilt's good for you."""
Daredevil,36grad,oldsillybear,6,Tue May 19 20:09:18 2015 UTC,"I really have to disagree.  It's not just about guilt, though that's part of it; it is certainly good to feel guilt when you have done something wrong.    I'm a devout practicing Catholic (daily Rosary, Mass 3-5 times a week, etc. type) and what it made me think of is the concept of bearing trials and sacrifices and uniting our pain and suffering to Christ's.    Full disclosure: I'm a 24-year-old convert, so I'm young and not raised by Catholics, and the concept of ""Catholic guilt"" that you're describing seems to be a fixture of older generations."
Daredevil,36grad,Jordoom,7,Wed May 20 04:46:02 2015 UTC,"Lifelong practicing Catholic, here - the guilt thing is really exaggerated in media. Taking sin and grace seriously in everyday life is certainly something every Catholic (and anybody, really) should do. Fixating on the wrongness of feeling guilty, particularly without a balanced look at the liberation of confession/grace, is a grave misrepresentation of practicing Catholic life that ultimately smacks of a desire to sin. That's my assessment, anyways, of a lifelong look at the ""Catholic Guilt"" thing, from the inside. While I've had my share of mortal sins to confess (and, hopefully not, but probably will in the future), life has been pretty light-hearted - paradoxically, The Cross does help one bear burdens well, both internal and otherwise."
Daredevil,36grad,AnguisViridis,14,Wed May 20 13:09:09 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree. The priest was great and I hope we see more of him. He has so much personality, like when Matt interrupted him, he got angry. He's a person with heart who sees in shades of grey, not black and white."
Daredevil,36grad,DernaNerna,5,Tue May 19 12:35:02 2015 UTC,the priests I have know were highly educated theologians who could argue either side in a religious debate. they came to their faith because of their knowledge not in spite of it so it was always fun trying to argue religion with them.
Daredevil,36grad,sweetgrasssmoke,10,Tue May 19 18:30:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about the comics, but from what I gather the religious aspect is very important to Matt's development. I can see why they would shy away from it with Cap, since there's enough America and religion controversy out there, plus he has enough to discuss. It'll be interesting to see if any of this filters over to the other Defenders shows."
Daredevil,36grad,poondi,10,Tue May 19 10:41:37 2015 UTC,"Matt Murdock is one of the few characters where religion is an integral part of the character and storyline. Other characters might have a religion but it rarely, if ever, plays into their story in any major way. So I don't think it's very relevant to bring up for any other MCU character."
Daredevil,36grad,hildesaw,1 point,Tue May 19 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. He's a good Irish Catholic boy trying to do good etc. One thing that I didn't like about the old movie was that Ben's Matt didn't seem to hesitate to maim or kill. This one does. He can't stand going all the way and killing anyone. Not if he doesn't have to. It's his Achilles Heel in a way.  That notion that he's a man conflicted about 'letting the devil out' is one of the reasons why I wish they had opened with that bit and not the flashback. Let it play out like it was a prologue, perhaps weeks before the actual fight, when Matt realizes what needs to be done. Save the flashback of the accident for later. Maybe as what he's dreaming when Foggy's call wakes him up."

The priest is a good and thoughtful and realistic guy.(I say this as an atheist who grew up in a Christian family.  That said, I've developed a fear about him: I fear that the writers will feel need to hurt Matt personally and deeply at some point by killing someone really close to him. Foggy would be the most hurtful target, but I'm guessing he's safe as a central character. So I think they may kill off the priest at some point to get Matt well and truly furious."

Regarding the AC miniseries, it was on the whole better than AoS, but still just okay.  The writers/producers of Daredevil, honestly, knocked it out of the park. I binge watched the entire series in 4 days and just loved it.  I appreciate the few tie-ins to the MCU. They came by as if they were just a matter-of-fact in that world... no big deal. That makes it all seem just to be just an accepted reality in the MCU. I liked the way handled it with subtlety."
Daredevil,36j6lj,chrismichaels3000,-2,Wed May 20 05:13:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I just haven't watched them yet. I haven't seen Age of Ultron yet, and I'm waiting until I do -- gonna wait until DVD release, as I hate the theater-going experience nowadays -- to watch those episodes in the airing order in relation to when Ultron was released. After the HUGE and INFURIATING spoiler that AoS revealed for Captain America 2, I am going to wait. They're sitting on my TiVo until I'm ready to watch them."
Daredevil,36j6lj,chrismichaels3000,-1,Sat May 23 16:14:56 2015 UTC,"The CA2 spoilier that AoS revealed was that SHIELD had been infiltrated by HYDRA. I had been faithfully watching (in groups of 2-3 episodes at a time) AoS, when all of a sudden HYDRA had infiltrated SHIELD on the show and all of the heroes were fighting in SHIELD installations to kill the bad guys and retake everything. It was made clear that this was because of all of the events that occurred in CA2.... which I had not seen yet, because I wanted to avoid all of the fanboys (and fangirls) in the theaters and give it a few weeks to thin out the crowds. But no, spoilers were revealed and a large part of the enjoyment was taken away."
Daredevil,36j6lj,chrismichaels3000,-1,Sat May 23 16:30:19 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Plus, didn't you just say ""I can't think of anything that was spoiled by AoS""?  Try again."
Daredevil,36j6lj,chrismichaels3000,-1,Sat May 23 21:06:34 2015 UTC,"Nope. There was no warning screen on the aired version, which is the version that my TiVo recorded. Maybe it was edited in for subsequent airings or for the streamed or dvd version, but not for the original airing.  Strike 2. Try again."
Daredevil,36e15g,Ontopourmama,14,Mon May 18 17:24:24 2015 UTC,"Batman and Daredevil are similar. They were reinvented by the same guy, Frank Miller, and that's what most filmmakers turn to when adapting these two characters.  I, agree, I love Daredevil taking a punch and getting exhausted. Made him more human. I'm surprised it took so long for a superhero adaption to do this."
Daredevil,36e15g,InsanityIsTrueSanity,4,Mon May 18 22:04:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't know Miller did Daredevil too. Now it makes sense."
Daredevil,36e15g,Algernon21,4,Mon May 18 22:33:24 2015 UTC,"I think what made me enjoy the series more is the development of the character itself, they chose just the right point in the origins story where it doesn't drag out too much and is extremely slow paced and where he's not past the stage of where the story is considered developed(ie the movie).  The balance and the foundation made it for a great first season, and   I really think that the follow up season would be spectacular - I am actually hyped to see him in action now, in his complete suit and in his element whereas the movie left much to be desired.  Plus, it's really gritty in comparison with the usual Marvel showing."
Daredevil,36e15g,RJCtv,3,Mon May 18 21:13:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, man, it's a, great, show, ."
Daredevil,36egw3,duermevela,1 point,Mon May 18 19:24:54 2015 UTC,"After a quick Google search, it doesn't look like Netflix has announced when Daredevil is coming out on home video"
Daredevil,36egw3,kirbyprower,0,Mon May 18 22:25:08 2015 UTC,"Netflix owns the distribution rights and they will not share it until they stop making money which may mean never, I am thinking."
Daredevil,36egw3,sweetgrasssmoke,2,Mon May 18 21:12:42 2015 UTC,You can buy DVDs for every other Netflix show
Daredevil,36egw3,kirbyprower,2,Mon May 18 22:22:49 2015 UTC,"Daredevil is a Netflix original. they can do whatever they want with it. I imagine the DVD release for Season 1 will coincide with the rising hype for season 2, sometime next year. who knows. I think the money guys are playing this one by ear because the success of Daredevil surprised everyone."
Daredevil,36egw3,sweetgrasssmoke,5,Mon May 18 23:09:08 2015 UTC,"Even the House of Cards season 1 DVD came out the same year. Give it time, I'll probably be out before winter"
Daredevil,36egw3,kirbyprower,1 point,Mon May 18 23:43:28 2015 UTC,"in time for the xmas shopping season, probably"
Daredevil,36egw3,sweetgrasssmoke,2,Tue May 19 17:58:28 2015 UTC,"Well when you have a 1:45 single shot fight scene in the second episode, you are bound to surprise people"
Daredevil,36egw3,NotQuiteFamous,2,Wed May 20 20:49:39 2015 UTC,hopefully they will keep that kind of stuff going in the second season. Arrow had some interesting fight choreography in the first season but the best stuff ended up on the cutting room floor and the second season just became boring.
Daredevil,36cge0,pleasedontabbabme,4,Mon May 18 07:21:15 2015 UTC,"Ah the all in one beast, daredevil, hawkeye, electra figure"
Daredevil,36cge0,tyranic_nero,3,Mon May 18 15:32:08 2015 UTC,Beastin'
Daredevil,36cge0,SPWatwin,2,Mon May 18 13:50:03 2015 UTC,Well Daredevil did become the Beast in Shadowland.
Daredevil,36chf2,unbrace,19,Mon May 18 07:36:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think he wanted to die. I think Wesley is extremely smart and at this point he just got severely cocky. He wholly underestimates Karen, why wouldn't be she took the plea early and everyone else simply rolls over to him and Fisk. He miscalculates her which is interesting as he often lets Fisk know his judgements of what he thinks other characters will do or react to disks movements."
Daredevil,36chf2,O_Snap_Crackle_Pop,8,Mon May 18 12:10:23 2015 UTC,"I too think it was a severe miscalculation on his part, he didn't expect Karen to get it, and when she did, he tried to bluff that the gun was empty because he didn't think she'd have the balls (Well she actually doesn't, but we're talking metaphorical balls) to shoot him."
Daredevil,36chf2,Algernon21,3,Mon May 18 21:17:04 2015 UTC,"Also, she was drugged and just came out of unconsciousness, Wesley probably figured there was no way she would be able to react faster than him. In his mind it was just a pretty solid intimidation."
Daredevil,36chf2,Doctor-Van-Nostrand,4,Mon May 18 17:52:31 2015 UTC,"I just assumed he was unsettled by the way his friend had changed, but a part of me thinks he might have wanted to push Wilson even further off the hinge with his death. Which does happen when Wilson visits Ben and kills him, all because he found out Ben saw his mother.  Or he didn't want to die and just thought he'd react faster but didn't take into account her reaching for it while his phone distracted him."
Daredevil,36chf2,Jaeryth,1 point,Mon May 18 09:48:57 2015 UTC,I am honestly a little pissed that he died lol. I loved his character!!!
Daredevil,36b33r,TheThinkologist,8,Sun May 17 22:48:31 2015 UTC,Born Again Last Rites The Devil In Cell Block D Some people don't like it but i thought Shadowland was cool. Edit: How could I forget Man Without Fear
Daredevil,36b33r,Doctor-Van-Nostrand,4,Mon May 18 01:18:59 2015 UTC,Guardian Devil by Kevin Smith is really good imo.
Daredevil,36b33r,AdddY13,1 point,Mon May 18 08:44:41 2015 UTC,Guardian Devil was def a great run by Kevin Smith. The surprise villain and all the dark stuff that happens was awesome.
Daredevil,36b33r,cajunsamurai,2,Mon May 18 17:26:04 2015 UTC,I enjoyed Daredevil Yellow.
Daredevil,36b33r,AssbuttInTheGarrison,2,Mon May 18 05:06:50 2015 UTC,"It's been on my ""to read"" list for a while now. I'll have to get on that."
Daredevil,36b33r,Doctor-Van-Nostrand,2,Mon May 18 14:44:00 2015 UTC,Check the /co/ recommendations page. We would really just be repeating that
Daredevil,36b33r,kirbyprower,3,Mon May 18 11:28:41 2015 UTC,"Its quoted below in case anyones wondering   http://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/wiki/faq#wiki_with_superheroes  The original Frank Miller/Klaus Janson run (Daredevil #158-191; collected in various formats)  Daredevil: Born Again by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli (Daredevil #227-233)  Daredevil: The Man Without Fear by Frank Miller and John Romita, Jr. (miniseries; collected in trade paperback format)  The Brian Michael Bendis/Alex Maleev run (Daredevil, vol. 2 #26-50, 56-81; collected in omnibus and Ultimate Collection formats)  The Ed Brubaker/Michael Lark run (Daredevil, vol. 2 #82-119, #500, Annual #1; collected in omnibus and Ultimate Collection formats)  The current Daredevil ongoing series by Mark Waid is a good jumping-on point."
Daredevil,36b33r,fench,2,Mon May 18 13:37:43 2015 UTC,"Its tricky. I've read over 50% of the Daredevil comics ever and there is so much good stuff. In particular, Miller, Brubaker and Bendis.... those three never really put a foot wrong imo"
Daredevil,36a286,theotacondon,3,Sun May 17 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"That comment about Marvel and TV was really weird.  He gave up after two episodes of shield and never even watched Agent Carter, even though he heard it was good?"
Daredevil,36a286,mike_hawks,3,Sun May 17 20:18:05 2015 UTC,Yeah not a great reviewer if he doesn't even give a show a few eps to find its footing
Daredevil,36a286,Exwind,2,Mon May 18 01:46:19 2015 UTC,But... Most of us have already seen it.
Daredevil,36a286,forrestdog2,2,Mon May 18 02:04:55 2015 UTC,Probably not the sub to post this in
