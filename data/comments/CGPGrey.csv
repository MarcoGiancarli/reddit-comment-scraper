If the former incomes were really from people patreoning gaming it would be more worrying (see: the social panic over the potato salad crowdfunding).   But there's a kind of symbiosis between streamers, advertisers, and watchers which is much more... insidious is too emotive a word, but it's the one I've got. Watchers don't think of it as costing anything to watch ads (if they do, they install adblocker). Streamers really are just offering what the people want.  Advertisers are the brokers who invented this idea of selling attention. Here I think is where a moral argument can be held. Is it immoral for them to capitalize on all this attention? The money is not being diverted from another program; the entire industry of advertising seems self-contained; it created the game and it can profit from it. If it didn't exist, if that economy didn't exist, I don't see it affecting science funding at all.   I feel myself slip from there down a slope into ""and that's why aggressively progressive taxes are important; if someone (either the advertisers or the streamers) starts making what you think is too much money, market demand be damned, then have it follow a logarithmic growth with a progressive tax so that it can be redistributed.""

Do the people that oppose free will believe in fate? That everything we do  that's not a neccesity moves us towards a goal that can be predicted? Hasn't the world shown itself to be complex enough to disprove that?  Talking about some abstract kind of free will that exists in the brain is useless. If some small variation in the body causes us to act in a certain way I would call that free will since it can not be predicted.  People are predictable as a group, as long as there are oddities that cannot be explained I will believe in free will. This is coming from someone with no education in the area though."

These work in varying ways, but all of them will add - at the very least - a fully working link back to the original message in Mail.app (or the message:// accepting app of your choice).   My workflow is to try and crunch email as quickly as possible into OmniFocus, then go through the Inbox just like I would any other set of tasks.

CGPGrey,3do9s8,sluuuurp,42,Sat Jul 18 02:52:20 2015 UTC,"Dear Brady and Grey,  I would like to inform you of another career that's a perfect fit for any Hello Internet listener.  I'm the sound guy on a travel documentary TV show. My day consists recording clean audio in some very exotic and beautiful places. I'm a one man crew that collects on location sound with hidden microphones clipped to subjects clothing, or with the iconic microphone attached to a long pole, called the boom mic.   Currently the crew and myself are stationed in China where we will stay for over 6 weeks. Its a wonderful opportunity to visit some locations that would make Brady and Grey shed tears out of pure joy and pure agony respectively.  However, it's not all excitement all the time. Anyone who has spent time on a film set will know that over the course of a shooting day there's a lot of waiting, especially when it comes to the sound department. Travel shows are no different. So, To alleviate the boredom that is inherent with waiting, I've rigged my phone into my sound recorder so I can listen to Hello Internet on my downtime and still make it look like I'm doing work.  Although, This became a problem a few days ago when I was taken by surprise that the crew started to film an interview. I had no time to unzip my bag and turn off my phone and I had to start recording immediately. So, for the entire length of the interview I was not only listening to a local Chinese man tell us about his life, but also Brady talking about the ridiculous ""brag humble"".  I figured this is the perfect career for a Hello Internet listener for three reasons.  1) I'm trained in audio so I know when Grey made a poor audio edit. (Remember to keep those breaths in Grey, makes the dialogue sound more natural)  2) I'm in situations that are not for anyone softer than at least a dozen nails.  And   3) If I accidentally hit someone with my boom pole because I was distracted I could send them off a cliff, or into a leech infested river, or into a giant evil spiders nest... Ect.  Thanks for reading, and producing some great content that is enjoyed by your multifaceted audience.  P.s. Brady I have a dream where we record a podcast while climbing Everest. Without Grey... Obviously."
CGPGrey,3do9s8,PrivateChicken,16,Sat Jul 18 02:00:52 2015 UTC,P.s. Brady I have a dream where we record a podcast while climbing Everest. Without Grey... Obviously.   Obviously. Grey took a helicopter to the top.

CGPGrey,3do9s8,Nuranon,31,Sat Jul 18 14:50:14 2015 UTC,"Grey has a point about people feeling like they've made some impact on climate change when really they haven't, but it's also true that if millions of people turn off their lights just for that feeling of being a good person, that does have a significant effect. It'd be better if they did more, but if the choice is between millions of people doing nothing or millions of people doing something small that adds up, the latter is the better option."
CGPGrey,3do9s8,AnneLiseRK,49,Fri Jul 17 23:08:05 2015 UTC,Well duh.  If you can convince millions of people to change their behavior for the better go for it.

If everyone thought like you, nobody would ever act. It's like with the ""my vote doesn't count"". Yeah, it's true on an individual level, but the problem is if everybody ends up thinking this, voters turn out are record low(which is more and more happening.) Tldr; individual action do matter, if enough people take them, but If everybody thinks their action don't matter, no actions are taken, and this is bad."

CGPGrey,3do9s8,Falterfire,34,Fri Jul 17 23:08:01 2015 UTC,No one deserves to be called the c-word or compared to Hitler for business decisions that they make. And it totally damages any credibility that reddit has when they do this shit.
CGPGrey,3do9s8,Particleofdark,10,Sat Jul 18 04:12:22 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, it might well be that reddit already has ""turned"" and nothing they can do will save it.  During the last 6 months I've noticed on several ""normal"" subreddits that their userbase has a racist majority (albeit in most cases slim majority).  Usually this becomes noticeable when a topic like refugees or gypsies or controversial issues about racism pop up and the community of the subreddit upvotes the openly racist comments and downvotes the disagreeing ones."
CGPGrey,3do9s8,linuxguruintraining,54,Sat Jul 18 13:07:54 2015 UTC,"I knew next to nothing about the whole Pao fiasco, and I actually read few threads specifically about it, but whenever I saw something pop up it always seemed to be racist or sexist.

CGPGrey,3do9s8,KipEnyan,26,Sat Jul 18 00:59:23 2015 UTC,I feel like the biggest reason for people hating on her was that people were hating on her. The vocal community of reddit truly does act like a hive mind. I'd love to read some research on the topic.
CGPGrey,3do9s8,PossibilityZero,7,Sat Jul 18 03:49:35 2015 UTC,"I agree, Brady really has a point with this. There is a difference between criticsm and shaming and those hitler comparisons and racist/sexist insults imo are the latter. I think Grey's rather positive attitude towards what has happened reflects his attachment to reddit and the principles of free speech but it is a rather opportunistic stance. Imo the end does not justify the means and this idea of shaming being an ok thing because of one having ""right"" or ""good"" intentions will end any kind of discussion and just make different groups in society hostile to each other. Even though one might objectively agree with a group of shamers this does not mean that their actions are beneficial to that cause dear to one's heart and imo it is very important not to let your personal believes (however considerate they might be) cloud your judgement.  I was rather surprised as some episodes ago Grey himself recommended ""so you have been publicly shamed"" by Ron Johnson which exactly deals with this topic and maybe I missed the point of Grey's argument. But being a supporter of free speech imo should also mean that one is critical towards our current discussion culture instead of just taking that as given. Listenning to the last episode of HI I found it really worrying how certain topics were/could not be openly discussed on the podcast because of their respective discussion cultures and the fear of ""just making it worse""."
CGPGrey,3do9s8,bwowm,18,Sat Jul 18 10:58:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the episode was clearly recorded before the massive mess that happened the past couple days. We know from previous events that /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels almost certainly approves of the decision not to ban CoonTown (although he might not, he didn't approve of decision to ban FPH and moving from that).  I really think he's both overestimating how much value is being generated from Free Speech At All Costs and underestimating the effect allowing racists to openly spew hate has on the interest of the people they're spewing hate against to continue posting here.  Does Reddit in general think that CoonTown (and similar subs) doesn't affect how and what other people talk about? Do they really think its presence doesn't visibly affect how conversation in the defaults runs?  I dunno. Hard to get numbers one way or the other. Difficult to prove that people are or aren't afraid to speak out or use Reddit based on it. I just am not thrilled with the idea if we can't define the exact line between reasonable and unreasonable we can't get rid of something as clearly past the line as Coontown.  'course. I could even be wrong about Grey even supporting not banning Coontown. That's just conjecture based on previous statements, not based on anything I've seen him say about this specific issue."

I'll bet dollars to donuts that Grey's got a little folder squirreled away with this as a potential video... it's just got CGPGrey written all over it.  Turns out that Panama has a bigger market share than the Bahamas.  I recall when I was younger hearing ads on the radio for cruise lines, with ""ships registry Panama"" spoken quickly at the end... dunno if it's a legal thing that they had to include that or not.  It's a bit dated, but David Foster Wallace's 1996 Harper's article ""On the (nearly lethal) comforts of a luxury cruise"" talks a bit of inside baseball about cruise ships.  Greek captains and crews and whatnot.  There are probably sources that are more up-to-date and in-depth out there on the 'net though."

But here's the twist:   the penalty word is ""food"". I thought it would be a good way to teach her that words only have the power we assign to them, but even so there can be real world consequences to saying certain words around certain people (like cursing at a job interview).  The problem? She takes the game too seriously and two years later she has never said the f word, ever. Not when she learned about the provender pyramid in school, not when asking what vittles there are in the fridge for a snack, it's like that word isn't in her vocabulary. Every once in a while I'll slip up, like when I was explaining how diffusion/concentration works to her using food coloring as an example. But instead of calling me out on it, she'll say ""What?"" or ""I don't understand"" or some other way to trick me into saying it again because the only thing more fun than watching me do 20 pushups is forcing me to do 40."

Our entire society is based on ""if you want something, take action for it"". It seems very unhuman to use inaction to make change.

It really goes both ways.  Yes, they are arbitrary words that a culture has assigned, but the reason they are assigned as naughty is because they are meant to signal great stress, anger, pain, frustration, disgust, etc.  Not only is it a signal to another person of your heightened feelings, but they can also reduce pain and stress in the person saying them.  Mythbusters did a segment that looks like has some scientific backing as well that people can endure pain for longer if they're allowed to swear.  edit: They demonstrably lose their effectiveness for the person using them if overused.

CGPGrey,3do9s8,User_Simulator,5,Sat Jul 18 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"That professor who goes on cargo ships instead of airplanes is almost certainly reducing his personal carbon footprint. Presuming that the ship is not significantly reconfigured to accommodate his presence and is going anyhow, he is utilizing wasted capacity in the system and the marginal weight he is adding to the ship and thus the increased energy used and fuel burned for that purpose is going to be much smaller than his utilization on a passenger airplane.  The argument that his taking the ship instead of the airplane doesn't cause the airplane to not go is not a good position to be taking. His reduction in demand for that airplane seat has a small reduction in the price that the airline is able to charge for it. When this drops below a particular threshold, the airlines can and do cut or reduce service on entire routes or choose to not expand service. The carbon value of these differences in activity is difficult to measure directly and attribution is a big, messy, complicated issue. It is completely reasonable to calculate carbon use on an individual basis as was suggested.  The problem, and where I think Grey starts making reasonable points, comes with the fact that this is a global problem with very large values and it is only through collective action will we make significant improvements.  The professor's plan only works as long as he is exploiting under-utilized resources, namely excess living space on cargo ships. This all falls apart once we think about scaling it up. The marginal weight of that professor was small, but what if we are talking about taking useful areas of the ship and transforming them into new passenger space? Now we have to start counting the weight of all of the rooms and potable water, and increased galley capacity and cleaning staff and anything else which is associated with an increase in passenger capacity and many more things from safety equipment to entertainment.  Compare this to the marginal increase of weight to increase the capacity of an airplane. Roughly take a row of seats and all of the material around them and divide that weight by the number of seats in that row. we also need to add a bit of wing, engine, and fuel to provide increased lift, and a portion of drink and meal service on the order of three cans of soda, part of a cupboard, and a tiny bit of bathroom and associated water.  The question of efficiency is whether the marginal weight of increasing passenger capacity on a ship is twenty times as large as on an airplane. Just eyeballing it, I think that the ship weight is likely going to easily meet that threshold.  Compare this to another 'solution' I like to rag on a bit. A few years ago a hippy professor I had was talking about how great bio-diesel was. He was running his car off of recycled restaurant oil and this was the future. Yes, he was utilizing a waste product (although his claims to reducing CO2 are arguable), but what happens when this source of material is fully exploited? Now we have to start growing plants specifically for this purpose and we have to start including all of the input costs of producing bio-diesel to measure how environmentally friendly it is. Hell, if the demand for waste oil lowers the net cost of oil for restaurants, then that difference needs to be counted against the use as automobile fuel.  If we accept that climate change from anthropogenic carbon emissions is a big problem requiring coordinated effort, we need to pursue solutions which produce large improvements at scale. Having everybody take a ship does not scale in this fashion. If one can figure out how to make exploiting these sorts of underutilized resources in a systematic way actually add up to large changes in carbon emissions, then fine, but realize that all of these tiny solutions are going to have to stay tiny in order to even work."

CGPGrey,3csmiq,MindOfMetalAndWheels,142,Fri Jul 10 13:13:52 2015 UTC,"I think there is a disconnect between what people think is hard and what is actually hard. I have difficulty understanding how anyone can look at what PewDiePie does and think it's easy. I would wager that almost nobody who thinks PewDiePie's work is easy would be able to do it. But perhaps they think that making the type of videos that he makes is not hard enough to merit millions.  Except there is no objective way to quantify how hard something is. There is a Hello Internet discussion between Grey and Brady about whether it would be harder to be a professional athlete winning the super bowl or a scientist winning the Nobel prize. The Nobel is a million krona, and more often than not that would be a few years worth of the laureate's annual salary. Apparently the top 10 paid NFL quarterbacks are all making north of 5M. UC Berkeley's top paid employee is not a Nobel laureate, but the football coach (and Berkeley has so many laureates they get special parking, according to Brady).  Is football ""harder"" than academia? What are those athletes getting paid for, exactly? Is it all the ""objectively difficult"" daily endurance training? The daily life of an academic is also objectively difficult, but perhaps people think that mental work is easier than physical work. Brady seems to think so, at least, but if he really maintains aspiring athletes have it harder than aspiring academics, I would wager he hasn't interacted much with graduate students.  Then the average age of a super-bowl winning quarterback is apparently 30. Physics is the field with on average the youngest Nobel laureates, and the average age there is 55. Brady says you can nick a Nobel prize with a bit of luck. But the type of person who can get lucky and get a Nobel prize is not Everyday Jane off the street, but a scientist who has dedicated a lifetime of work to their field. The same is true for athletes, don't get me wrong.  But that is all irrelevant.  They get paid because we value what they produce. And you might take issue with the fact that society values the football coach more than the laureate (I certainly do) but the fact of the matter is there are more football fans than science fans, so it makes sense. And there are apparently more gaming fans, so PewDiePie gets to reap."

(Which, even if that is true, ignores all the other work that goes into running a Youtube channel, the mental exertion of being ""on"" for the length of a video, etc.)"
CGPGrey,3csmiq,ohfouroneone,2,Fri Jul 10 18:29:19 2015 UTC,Also people compare PewDiePie's let's plays with SA-style let's plays and since his have far less production value it seems like it's much easier. I don't know if it actually is.

Would it be better for Grey to space releases out over different avenues, even though he doesn't like the idea of sitting on something and would rather publish it ASAP.   There is going to be a time when Grey wants to take a vacation and the audience will be a bit starved for content."
CGPGrey,3csmiq,maximilian_dc2,4,Fri Jul 10 14:52:48 2015 UTC,"Well there is a slim chance of pre-recording podcasts, since they are usually topical to some current event, and there's no good way of building a buffer while staying current  He could make a general video on a non-current idea, and schedule it for release at a later date, but he's stated he doesn't like that.  If (a big if) he makes LP/streaming a thing, he could keep a hefty backlog there (play for 1-3 hrs, cut into 30 minute ep's), but that would not only take more work, but it would involve much more planning than just playing a game.

I was at least familiar with some of Grey's videos, but I also recommended Cortex to a friend of mine who had no idea who Grey was and he's been enjoying it so far.  I'm considering checking out HI, but my podcast schedule is already pretty booked up and I've already been listening less than I have in the past. It might happen, but no guarantees ;)"
CGPGrey,3csmiq,linuxguruintraining,7,Thu Jul 16 12:58:16 2015 UTC,"I've been aware of HI, but haven't started yet.  It's a tough decision whether to go with recent content that looks terribly interesting (Royal Society), or start from the beginning to get up to speed on all cannon, inside jokes, etc. It'll be an issue for me if I like it, because I won't be able to stop until I'm caught up. For example, I found Brady's channel ""Objectivity"" last week, and within a day had watched them all.  I've been subscribed to CGP in youtube for a year or two, plus the mailing list  I started Cortex because I'm transitioning between working in an office for somebody else, and working out of my house for myself, and am hooked.  I have 600 miles to drive next Tuesday, and will likely start HI then."
CGPGrey,3csmiq,xyrth,16,Fri Jul 10 17:30:49 2015 UTC,"Oh you really need to start from the beginning. HI is at least 70% inside jokes, and follow-up from previous episodes."

It is called the Glomar response after a CIA-built ship that was supposed to salvage a sunken Soviet sub that was discovered by the media.

CGPGrey,3csmiq,rumor33,9,Fri Jul 10 23:31:46 2015 UTC,"The same question a little broader, what stops him from giving a different address depending on the situation.

Last week we were driving somewhere and the podcast I had been listening to ended, then an episode of Cortex started. After 90 seconds of silence she said, ""Who is the guy who's talking? Because it's not [/u/JeffDujon]."" Hearing her tone, I glanced over and confirmed that she was clearly unhappy that we were listening to a podcast with /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels but not /u/JeffDujon.  I explained who /u/imyke is and what Cortex is about, and that Hello Internet is still a thing that exists and it is still just /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels and /u/JeffDujon.

I have been known to watch sparsely-edited let's plays in the past, but only if their content is really good. For instance, Etho's videos are quite long, but some of his creations are genius.  I much prefer more intentional, well-crafted let's plays, such as those Spumwack aka TheMinecraftMuse used to make.

It is, quite literally, electronic mail. It's a notch above a physical letter. Nobody I know would ever email friends or family for any reason. The only reason email is ever used is its necessity in the world of old people who aren't good at using it anyways. I know precisely no email addresses. I can count the number of emails I've ever sent that weren't replies on my hands and feet.

Text messaging for certain people, Facebook for others, GroupMe or similar systems for context-specific purposes (EG, a short-term project group). It's useful for isolating people so that everything only goes to those who need to see it, and it's useful for isolating contexts so that personal vs professional vs education vs what-have-you aren't all dogpiled on top of each other.

Maybe Slack will rise in prominence, maybe something else will come in. These things are hard to predict, but I'm confident that it'll work itself out, and that the end result will be an order of magnitude better than the aging email paradigm."

It would seem that personal / public / business would be clear, but I'm sure there's some reason behind it.  I know he's stated that he has roughly 452 different google accounts, and they're decent at being handled simultaneously, but not perfect. I understand that folders / filters / rules can have a similar effect, but it isn't the same mental state for each.  I open my business email when I want to work, and know that if everything is read in there, I've responded to everybody.  Also, a bitch:  I've been a paying member of Audible for 2 years, in that time I have listened to a ton of books, I'm a pretty active user. I really like that they support the content I enjoy, but I'm really annoyed that the marketing is targeted to new users.  I'm not looking for free books, I just want a damned link directly to the book discussed.  I'm surprised that Audible doesn't seem to care about sales of books to existing users based on recommendations from content they support.

CGPGrey,3csmiq,ExploringSpace,7,Sat Jul 11 12:05:57 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the problem with email at all.  I used to get 150/day and be out of the office interviewing for large chunks of time and no-one waited more than 24 hours for a reply.  Oh, and I had a phone that rang so much the battery would be dead by 3pm.  These were some of my thoughts as I listened to you. <rant>  Why do you have personal stuff and business stuff in the same email inbox?  Separate them, and the personal stuff set to skip the inbox, mark as read and star.  That way it's there when you want it, and it doesn't add to the counter on your phone giving you one of those horrid red number counts.  Things that are work related but not urgent (newsletters for example) go to personal and you get to it when you can.  The first newsletter or other email I get from a company or individual that does give value for time spent reading it, gets unsubscribed.  No takebacks, no mercy.  (Oh, and I communicate with my parents with email all the time.  Once every 3 weeks or so, we talk by skype, but our days don't line up well (8 hours apart) and an asynchronous conversation is better.)  If you can't work out how to delete a notification (and I agree, facebook and linkedin are the worst), or if you don't even want to bother, set up a rule to delete them.  In gmail that's five clicks and what seems to be bothering you a lot, gone forever.  (If they change the email address, find another commonality like the subject line - for example: subject: is now following you on Twitter! goes straight to delete).  Any service that sends you receipts and order confirmations but has that info stored (for example Amazon), delete with a rule.  Come tax time, print out the report they give you and/ or use excel to categorize things easily.  Use textexpander to write standard replies.  For example: Thank you for your interest.  I am not looking for books to review at this time. Love and kisses, Grey.  Use their 'fill in the blank' feature with books to review, interviews, or whatever else you don't want to do.  If you use /no as your keyboard short cut, that's maybe 10 letters for their name, 3 for the short cut, 5 to type books and 1 click to hit send.   The same for feedback.  Or allocate all of those those to your assistant, by using a label or a star and have her write the standard replies.   You don't need to read messages from the dentist - just put a recurring task on whatever your task manager is a year from the time you last went.  The same goes for haircuts, medicine refills and anything else that has to be done repeatedly.  Now emails from your dentist, doctor and anyone else can be directly archived, or given a label that means 'check once a week'.    Every time you go into email, take a quick look and delete anything which is from a company or someone you don't want to talk to.  Then you're working from a smaller list, which feels easier.    When you're in a company, move the announcements to a special folder and put time on your calendar to read it once a week.  It can either wait a week, or you will find out about it a different way (someone will tell you about a fire drill).  When you're doing email, reduce the clutter on the screen.  No Google, I do not want to see this person's face (I'm faceblind anyway so it's of no use), indicators to tell me who it was sent to (I can read), more information about the person who sent it (I know them or I don't), circles, extra labels or anything else you want to suggest.  It's one inbox, me and the email.  Google's ""helpful"" suggestions can stay out of the room.  </rant>  I don't expect you to consider any of these, but maybe they will be helpful to someone.  TL;DR  Use technology against humans.  You+Technology > humans.  *ninja edit for readability."

Certainly considering CO2 it is not worse than airplanes. Both modes of transport rely on burning carbon chains for their energy, moving stuff through the air, staying air borne requires more energy than moving through water with a ship, per unit of mass. CO2 wise a cargo ship is much more efficient than an airplane."
CGPGrey,3cgw8n,kd131313,63,Tue Jul 7 21:15:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Per tonne of cargo, shipping produces less than 1% of the carbon emissions of air freight."
CGPGrey,3cgw8n,ohfouroneone,25,Tue Jul 7 21:28:40 2015 UTC,"Besides, I think Brady's friend has a point. Commercial aircrafts serve no other purpose other than transporting humans and consume massive amounts of kerosene while only carrying a few hundred people at most. So the carbon print per pessenger is actually quite large compared to travelling on a cargo ship that has loads of space for travellers and Carry them for no additional emissions."

I've heard some pretty absurd things about shipping, like fishermen in England send their catch to China, where it's processed then sent back to England. If cargo ships produce a significant fraction of carbon pollution, then the question becomes to ship or not to ship, rather than ship by air or sea."

CGPGrey,3cgw8n,isprobablysleeping,13,Wed Jul 8 03:55:10 2015 UTC,"That's when you're comparing cargo ships to passanger planes. Cruise ships, on the other hand, produce much more CO2 per passenger than planes.   Carnival, which comprises 11 cruise lines, said in its annual environmental report that its ships, on average, release 712.kg of CO2 per kilometre. Carnival's ships carry, on average, a maximum of 1,776 passengers. This means that 401g of CO2 is emitted per passenger per kilometre, even when the boat is entirely full. This is 36 times greater than the carbon footprint of a Eurostar passenger and more than three times that of someone travelling on a standard Boeing 747 or a passenger ferry."

You see I'm very proud that in 1970 I suggested to a watch company that normally on a watch when you pull out the stem the second handstops and you have to move the minute hand around once to get the hour hand to move. I said to the watch company: ""You don't want to stop the second hand, and you don't want to forget where the minute hand is. Otherwise you'll lose the accuracy."" I said they should have two hour hands, one of which stays tied to the minute hand and the other which moves just one hour at a time. If you screw that up, you can look down here at the second face. That's why you have two hour hands - one of them is home time, and the other local time. I didn't get paid anything for that invention! I showed it to them and they said ""Oh, isn't that something!"" But this two on one strap is one-of-a-kind. They're both Omega, one is the watch they use on the Space Station.   Source"

CGPGrey,3cgw8n,Agothro,77,Tue Jul 7 21:01:49 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I've been waiting for the free will discussion. Pretty much from the first ""Grey is a robot, Brady grossly misconstrues his position"", this has been on the horizon.  The one thing that gets me with Grey's position is how high-level he makes the black box cutoff. Like, I feel like a healthy bit of introspection could lead to some sort of insight of why a cargo boat tracker is more interesting than a plane tracker. That is way too high level to blame on arcane brain chemistry. It just sort of seems like intellectual laziness.  As to the ""understanding how a rainbow works makes it less beautiful"" thing, it's more of an exchange. There is undoubtedly a sense of wonder that is lost, but a different one that is gained. You exchange the mysterium tremendum of the rainbow as a unit for the mysterium tremendum of the laws of the universe. Whether it's an equal exchange or not varies by individual, I suppose.  But yeah, obviously free will doesn't exist. Adequate determinism is the order of things. But since we are all equally unfree beings, we are, in a sense, all equally free. If someone gives me flowers, that's a lovely gesture. The fact that it's just a result of chemistry doesn't make it any less lovely. I am bound by the same chemistry.  Lastly, on the topic of robots not doing things out of willpower making it all inherently less appealing, this goes back to the assumption that no matter how good robots get, they won't have willpower. I've worked on cognitive architectures with willpower. Robots can have whims and everything else. Your ideal wife robot will not necessarily do everything you want, because that's not what you want. Your ideal wife robot will reject you and challenge you in just the right ways that you want. So yeah, I think Brady is imagining a much more prescriptivist robot future than what's actually coming."
CGPGrey,3cgw8n,meganeuramonyi,25,Tue Jul 7 22:38:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anything ""obvious"" about free will not existing; certainly, we ACT like those around us have a choice. I think Grey (and people with his opinion) have far too much faith in the perfection of a machine. Ask any coder; the process of getting stuff to run is often more art than science at times.  Now, perhaps this is simply because the machine is too complex for our puny meat minds to understand, but one could as easily characterize it in a more chaos-theory manner where it's very dependent on even minor things about the hardware and software in question. Here, I am mindful of the evolutionarily designed circuit that had a seemingly pointless loop that made the circuit stop working when removed; it turned out that this circuit had happened to select for wireless transmission of power. We know that below a certain level of the universe we can only speak of probabilities, not certainties - that's the premise of quantum mechanics, after all. And while these are very tiny changes, we also know that in sufficently chaotic systems tiny changes can result in huge differences.  Perhaps it's not classical free will, perhaps it is 'chance', but something's got to be making one or the other probability occur. If it results in two physically identical brains making different decisions, it's close enough to call for me."
CGPGrey,3cgw8n,dide101,15,Wed Jul 8 07:42:43 2015 UTC,"one could as easily characterize it in a more chaos-theory manner   Chaotic systems are still deterministic, so there's no room for free will in there.   something's got to be making one or the other probability occur   We have considerable experimental evidence that it's just random chance. I don't know about you but living my life based off of coin tosses doesn't seem like free will to me. I'd like to hear Grey talk about this because it does dull his 'it's all a result of how my brain is assembled' point if at some point in turns into coin tosses informed by the way his brain is assembled.  If it isn't random chance, then it must be a deterministic process that leaves even less room for free will. Arguing that there's some hidden free will variable is either arguing that everything in the Universe makes choices and has free will (because everything obeys the physical laws), or else it's arguing that only humans/intelligent lifeforms have this variable because we're special. Both seem absurd to me."
CGPGrey,3cgw8n,IAmZeUsername,13,Wed Jul 8 09:14:13 2015 UTC,"So that is what I meant by what's called ""adequate determinism"". It's the determinism favored by Stephen Hawking, who explained that, on a large enough scale (and in the case of talking about quantum effects, a single human cell is a large enough scale) the effects of quantum weirdness statistically level out. They don't matter. The probabilities are balanced such that over a timespan of say, the lifespan of our universe, they're never going to change anything on a macro level. That's adequate determinism.  As far as having faith in the perfection of machines, I'm a computer scientist who's done research in cognitive science and worked on cognitive architectures that have motivation and, to some extent, ""free will"". There's nothing arcane about it. You put in a big slew of fuzzy inputs (no real other choice when your bottom-up systems are neural net based), you put them through some feedback loops that have way too many weights and outside factors to predict (EG, one input might come through a pathway that was particularly well traveled by a different input, so everything that comes in through that channel is colored in a certain way) and out comes ""free will"". The subproject I worked on had free will in terms of music composition, but I know there was another one that was simulating human nomadic tribe dynamics.  There is absolutely no scientific reason to assume that a sufficiently advanced computer and the human brain differ fundamentally in any way. And if that's the case, which it very much appears to be, there's no such thing as free will. But even if that's not the case, there's no such thing as free will, because we live in an adequately deterministic universe."
CGPGrey,3cgw8n,commanderpepper,9,Wed Jul 8 14:31:16 2015 UTC,"Actually, Brady's argument of essentially, ""understanding how a rainbow works makes it less beautiful"" is a very good argument for artificial, whole-universe simulations. It's essentially the same thinking as ""ignorance is bliss"". The aliens are out there, but their worlds got so full of pollution, that they just plugged themselves into their super-computer dream-machines, and they never looked back, because they all collectively erased their knowledge of it being a fake."

CGPGrey,3cgw8n,RustyRook,27,Tue Jul 7 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"Brady, when you talk about how Grey can enjoy the company of non-free-will people, you're touching on a position in philosophy called compatibilism. This is a cliche beginning to philosophical arguments, but let's press on and: We need to defined 'free will'. Compatiblists say that free will doesn't mean that you can do anything that isn't already determined; what you want to do will always be determined by the arrangement of the atoms in your brain. The thing is, if you have a friend over, you're okay saying that some things about them are determined; for example, you probably won't want to strip and run through the streets while shouting praise of Pelor. This determinism isn't a violation of free will. Furthermore, the ability to determine someone's behavior is fundamental to our understanding of other people; we call it 'personality'. Compatibilists say that free will has nothing to do with whether or not everything is determined; free will means being able to do what we want. What we want will always be determined, but apparently, we're okay saying that. If a gun's being held to my head while I buy flowers, that's not free will because I if I want to do something else, I can't. But if I can choose whether or not to buy flowers, and that means that I have free will, and it doesn't matter whether or not some supercomputer can predict my choice.  So essentially, I'm taking Grey's position and going all the way to the end; not only does it not matter to me whether all my choices are just physics problems, it does not matter to my free will."

CGPGrey,3cgw8n,RustyRook,10,Wed Jul 8 00:11:37 2015 UTC,I'm coming in way too late to this - but I have a Fermi Paradox solution (and a dark matter solution) which I think is pretty interesting.  There is a lot of matter seemingly missing from the universe. There's also a lot of alien civilizations seemingly missing from the universe. The answer is that advanced civilization are harvesting 100% of the energy of their local system. They don't emit any radio waves etc because that would be a waste of energy. They are energy limited - not dumb enough to just go spraying off precious energy into space.  This also solves dark matter because the per cent of the universe by weight that we can't find is the per cent of the universe being harvested by advanced civilizations.

He has a lot of stories about the Apollo 11 astronauts.  Regarding their personalities:  Armstrong was really quiet, hated speaking in public, and once pinned him up against a wall while screaming about having to give his autograph to a small boy.  Buzz Aldrin loves the spotlight, talking, and giving autographs, but only if he gets paid for it. (Apparently ""so I'm getting paid for this, right?"" is his favorite thing to say.)

CGPGrey,3cgw8n,SomeGoodInThisWorld,44,Tue Jul 7 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"Brady arguing that we can't feel pleasure if we're computers sounds exactly like crazy religious people arguing against evolution.   If we're just sacks of molecules why is incest so wrong?   This, I think, is a fundamental misunderstanding. Yes, we're made up of molecules, and yes, our brains are nothing more than computers, but that doesn't stop us from actually feeling the things we feel. Just as with anything else, things change once you look close enough, but it doesn't matter. Being aware of the human condition being somewhat robotic doesn't change the human condition as it exists, just how educated we are about it.  I'm with Grey. There is nothing magical about humans. Eventually we'll be able to measure every little thing about ourselves."
CGPGrey,3cgw8n,Kerwin15,9,Tue Jul 7 22:26:06 2015 UTC,"If we're just sacks of molecules why is incest so wrong?   This is a great example to get people to argue to completion actually. For instance, at the very end of the conversation: do they say incest (assuming child incest, not adult incest, which is a different issue) is wrong because of some vague yuck factor, or because of consent? If consent, how do they define consent, and why can children not give it? The answers given along the way are very revealing."
CGPGrey,3cgw8n,SomeGoodInThisWorld,5,Tue Jul 7 23:18:57 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, the people who use these arguments (at least the ones we hear about) tend to not use it for that purpose, but rather as a logical fallacy to make to disconnected things alike. With the example I gave I've heard that phrase used as an argument against marriage equality, because they're equating something they consider unnatural with something else they consider unnatural even though it holds no water."
CGPGrey,3cgw8n,eggswithcheese,3,Tue Jul 7 23:26:58 2015 UTC,"Again, argue to the logical (or illogical) end. The connection they are trying to make is choice on the part of at least some of the participants. You can invalidate that connection by bringing up lack of consent in the case of the child, which you can compare to adult heterosexual rape, which in turn is clearly wrong and can't be argued against by a rational person. You have to remember that while people will make invalid, illogical arguments, it doesn't mean they are incapable of following logical arguments, just that they are repeating what others are telling them."

The issue is the answer to the following question: what is healthy?  While weight loss is quite correlated to health, I would not ever say they are equal. I think the most important thing is to be healthy. Being at a healthy weight will likely result from making actually healthy decisions, but it is not completely the solution in itself.  One last thing, I think a lot of us are still hung up on the wrong things. We are still clinging to a lot of old and bad advice that told us what was healthy and what was not.

The supposed counter to this is SRS, but SRS is an acknowledged over-the-top circlejerk that is almost aggressive about keeping to themselves.  As to Victoria, obviously they should've had a better communication channel with the mods, and they've installed a mod communications employee since, but just because we interact with her and like her doesn't mean we have any right to her employment status. That's between her and reddit and nobody else.  As to 'suppression of discussion'... What? The reddit frontpage was nothing but calling Pao literally Hitler for days. And there's still a good chunk of that. There was legitimate defamation happening constantly, that they were pretty lax about, when they would've had every right in the world to crack down on it.

CGPGrey,3cgw8n,AnotherMasterMind,4,Wed Jul 8 01:05:49 2015 UTC,"As soon as you guys mentioned the asteorid thing, I remembered that there was a meteor that hit Russia early 2015 AND Vladimir Putin disappeared from Russia for ~10 days without explanation.  But I looked up the dates. The Russian meteor ""landed"" (never touched the surface"" February 15th. Putin disappeared March 5th to March 15th. That's a bummer. It would have been very cool if he was hiding from the meteor.  Also, Brady, I don't think you understood a word Grey said about free will. Of course you make choices, but you do so in the same way that water fits its container: you follow the laws of physics. So put yourself in exactly the same situation (same mental state and set of estimuli) and you'll make the exact same choice. That doesn't make it less of a choice. A different set of circumstances, mental state, or a different person would probably have made a different choice, so receiving a flower from someone IS special.  PS: Because I've had this discussion more times than I can count, I'll clarify. Same mental state means every elemental particle from every cell in your body and the energy distribution, fields such as electromagnetic, etc. are exactly the same. Variations of the mental state/circumstances can lead to the same results, but the same mental state and circumstances guarantee it."
CGPGrey,3cgw8n,ChristianAvery,4,Wed Jul 8 11:41:24 2015 UTC,"maybe it's just my view of it but the whole Computers can fundamentally emulate humans debate was mostly Grey attempting to ""humanize"" computers by arguing how there's no magic factor to a human's humanity and thus we will eventually be able to fully reproduce it within the constrains of a computer, while Brady took it as an attempt at ""Dehumanizing"" humans by claiming that we are basicly just meat and bones computers. And it just go to show how difficult it is to comunicate ideas to other people"
CGPGrey,3cgw8n,AGreatHooligan,4,Wed Jul 8 12:49:10 2015 UTC,"In transitioning from arguing that rainbows are better when one thinks they are magic to arguing that by Grey's logic he should not enjoy fiction because he doesn't believe it Brady defeats his own argument. He's using an example of not enjoyment of something known to be fictional to argue that blind believe begets beauty.  Fiction is better because it is not real. It's abstraction allows for better exploration of complex ideas than always using literal examples. This is what art is.  I think a very good example of this is an academic exploration of theology over a dogmatic one. Something like Bibledex is far more fascinating than a sermon because it relates something to our historical, artistic and anthropological context. It brings more truth and understanding.  Brady also fails to recognise that belief eliminates joy from other sources. If one finds more pleasure from reading the bible because they think it is literally true than otherwise, one has limited one's ability to find pleasure in Sikhism or Islam because they think it's heresy.  On a personal note, the other day there was a massive thunderstorm which lasted for sometime and seemed to be right over where I live. It was massively interesting (and also somewhat annoying because it happened after midnight). As I lay awake watching the great sheet lightening out my window, which brightened the sky to a daylight blue, and heard the great roar of thunder I was reminded of a radio story I had heard about why it is that lightening and rivers and trees take the shape that they do. How an anarchic universe trends toward efficiency. How these disparate things were all connected by an underlying principal.  Tales of Thor are exciting, but that was much better. Besides, knowing one is false, I still get to enjoy both."

Isn't it possible that in order to make them as complex as a human brain that you'll have shrink the transistor-equivalent down to the size of a neuron. And maybe at that scale, the neuron is the design needed to make that work, so at that point you won't even be building a computer to simulate a human brain, you'll just be building a brain."

There is evidence that a newborn is receptive to the intonation of the mother's native language(s), and favours it - it can be seen as part of forming emotional attachments.  That is, babies are receptive to language whilst still in the womb.  (It's also possible that the newborn may specifically be receptive to the mother's idiosyncratic speech patterns; however the language centre would still be involved.)  I haven't included any sources, I'm aware.  I may have time to find some tomorrow, if requested."

CGPGrey,3bzmse,shinatsuhikosness,11,Fri Jul 3 15:09:31 2015 UTC,"I feel like these games are one of those things that people guess Grey would like but he would actually loathe.

CGPGrey,3bzmse,KipEnyan,45,Fri Jul 3 18:18:00 2015 UTC,Really? you support fahrenheit?   But it makes no sense!   </3
CGPGrey,3bzmse,Slyfox00,10,Fri Jul 3 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"The true advantage of SI units is the ease of unit conversion.  You don't have to think or get out a calculator to figure out how many meters are in 3.2km, whereas you would have to work to figure out how many feet are in 3.2 miles. But with temperature, there is almost no unit conversion.  Other than physicists who use millidegrees when approaching absolute zero (who often use scientific notation and Kelvin anyway), there's almost no unit conversion in temperature.  The main other advantage cited for Celsius is that it's based on the temperature at which water boils and freezes.  But that was only an advantage when the system was being created.  If the meter had been based off of a stick that Joseph-Louis Lagrange found rather than one ten-millionth the distance from the equator to the North pole, the meter would be no less useful.  Literally every phenomenon other than water boiling and freezing occurs at a temperature that must be looked up or memorized.  Memorizing that water freezes at 32F isn't much more of a challenge than memorizing that body temperature is approximately 37C.  I'm not saying that you guys should switch to Fahrenheit.  I'm just saying it's a lot less of a problem than all our other units.  And if you grew up in Fahrenheit, it's a comfortable system.  You get used to statements like ""highs will be in the mid-sixties,"" or ""bundle up, lows will be in the 20s."""

CGPGrey,3bzmse,Slyfox00,2,Fri Jul 3 23:56:52 2015 UTC,"That data says that only ~34% live in that area, which is not most people. And Fahrenheit doesn't have the same problems because the whole scale isn't based around the freezing point of water. The whole argument for Celsius is the immutable 0C of the freezing point, which is actually quite mutable, whereas none of the arguments for Fahrenheit have anything to do with freezing point being at 32F. If the freezing point is suddenly 34F, who cares, that wasn't a selling point of the scale anyways. 0C = freezing is pretty much the only selling point of Celsius."
CGPGrey,3bzmse,Bluezephr,4,Fri Jul 3 20:00:31 2015 UTC,"The data says 33.5% of the world’s population lives within 100 meters of sea level.  <The median person lived at an elevation of 194 m above sea level   (50% of the earth's population)  <Numbers of people decreased faster than exponentially with increasing elevation.""  Here is an altitude chart. http://www.mide.com/products/slamstick/air-pressure-altitude-calculator.php  0m = 1.00 atm  152m = .98 atm  305m = .96 atm  The majority of the entire plant lives between 1 atm and 0.96 atm."
CGPGrey,3bzmse,KipEnyan,3,Fri Jul 3 20:26:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and how often does the freezing and boiling point of water affect your daily life? I'm going to guess very little, if at all. Celsius makes plenty of sense when you're doing water-centric chemistry, but very little sense when you're talking about human beings. It's a scale that is explicitly designed to be used as 0-100, but the temperature ranges that are applicable to humans are roughly -20 to 40. That's a shitty scale. A scale where 0-100 pretty much covers the full range of human-applicable temperatures makes much more sense for everyday human use."
CGPGrey,3bzmse,Varis78,6,Fri Jul 3 18:34:59 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm currently drinking water with icecubes in it.  and maybe I'll boil water this evening for some noodles?  It's been pretty hot lately, so I don't think it will snow, but if it was going to, the temperature would around 0, not the arbitrary '32' of fahrenheit.  All of the rest of the world seems to be find using Celsius just fine for everyday stuff. Europe isn't is chaos because they can't do weather reports  There \o/ now you know what the weathers like around the world, and most everybody on earth seems to be fine using it."
CGPGrey,3bzmse,Droggelbecher,3,Fri Jul 3 18:44:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but does the temperature of your ice cubes matter? Do you think about them being 0C. Same thing for boiling water, do you think about it being 100C? I know I sure as hell don't. Anything above ""this burns my skin"" temperature doesn't matter anymore. You just boil the water.  Obviously everyone gets by just fine with Celsius, and as I've already said, it makes a hell of a lot more sense to use for chemistry than Fahrenheit does (for some pretty arbitrary reasons, but reasons nonetheless), but the fact that everyone is used to a scale doesn't make it good. If there was a scale of human temperatures that was logarithmic and went from 1-20, where 1 was super cold, 10 was the freezing point of water, and 20 is super hot, I'm sure people would get along with it just fine, but that doesn't make it a good scale. ""Everyone does it."" is the least compelling reason for a thing that I can imagine.  Fahrenheit is a clearer, more intuitive, and more elegant scale for measuring temperature in the everyday life of a human being, plain and simple."
CGPGrey,3bzmse,Terocon,4,Fri Jul 3 18:56:02 2015 UTC,"but the fact that everyone is used to a scale doesn't make it good   I couldn't agree more, but in terms of Fahrenheit.  My biggest thing about that argument for Fahrenheit is that it's unnecessary to have that level depth of precision in every day life.    30C is about 86F, and 31C is about 88F. Does anyone ever need that extra precision on a weather report? If you're going to the beach do you need to know it's 87F? No, not at all.   You need Fahrenheit in increments of 5. 45F, 50F, 55F, 60F etc.  Is 55F so different from 60F on the human scale of feeling temperature that you need extra ticks between them to understand? No.  Celsius makes more sense on human scales of 'heat' as well as simple earth temperatures. We live on a water planet, and Celsius better describes the world around us in simple terms.  Tho let me be clear, I respect your opinion and I mean no malicious intend in my words. I'm just passionate about what I think is a better system."
CGPGrey,3bzmse,AshuraSpeakman,3,Fri Jul 3 19:17:45 2015 UTC,"pretty significantly actually. I live in Winnipeg, and when its winter and a warm day, it's always a cause for concern if the temperature ever crosses  the 0 mark, because you can expect horrible traffic, and to slip and fall. I'm pretty sure having the freezing point of water be intuitive also assists with flooding preparation and monitoring for the general public.  It's quite cute that you think the temperature ranges that are applicable to humans begin at -20. -30 to -40 is pretty routine in the winters here. If I remember correctly -40 was indoor recess, and -45ish was when school got cancelled(happened multiple times)."
CGPGrey,3bzmse,stevebarker288,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:29:35 2015 UTC,"Lol, you're acting like people who use Fahrenheit don't all intuitively know that the freezing point is 32F. Like, oh drats, is it going to snow, I can never remember where the freezing point is. Doesn't happen.  Obviously we all get along with our scales just fine as we're used to using them, but if you step out of it and look at it functionally, you're using a scale designed as a 100 degree scale, and by your description of the harsh, brutal winters of Winnipeg (I'm from Buffalo, we get the same thing, and, incidentally, -40 F and -40 C are the same temperature), half of it is being used below the zero point. That's a bad scale."
CGPGrey,3bzmse,Zartonk,5,Fri Jul 3 19:39:57 2015 UTC,"I love this. While I totally support Kelvin for scientific use, I definitely feel like Fahrenheit is the best scale for day-to-day living. I have no idea what the practical benefit of Celcius is over either of the other two scales. >_>"
CGPGrey,3bzmse,SomeGreenGoo,16,Sat Jul 4 06:57:48 2015 UTC,"There is no practical benefit for either of them.  I grew up with Celsius, so I know that 40° is hot. 36° is human temperature. 0° is cold. And so on. But it's just as subjective as Fahrenheit. 0° is cold. 100° is warm.  The only benefit of celsius coming from a scientific standpoint is that 1K = 1C. So all you need to do when you need to calculate from Kelvin to Celsius is to add 273.15. It's not that easy with Fahrenheit."

Like would you record an episode of HI or Cortex right after you release a video, or do you shut down everything during this time?

CGPGrey,3b7lx3,DeathHaze420,17,Fri Jun 26 17:56:42 2015 UTC,Probably because those were the easiest vibrant dye colours to make at the time.
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,TheTacitBlues,14,Fri Jun 26 18:09:22 2015 UTC,"Those colors are fairly common among world flags. UK, Iceland, US, the Netherlands, France, Russia, Luxembourg, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, etc. But they chose similarity shades to the US."

CGPGrey,3b7lx3,MrSunshoes,43,Fri Jun 26 17:29:09 2015 UTC,It's somewhat vexing to think there's competition vying for views in vexillology videos.

CGPGrey,3b7lx3,tfofurn,85,Fri Jun 26 19:48:43 2015 UTC,Which is stupid. As I haven't and will not see that video so I miss out on grey flags for no reason.
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,PsychoticLime,29,Fri Jun 26 17:44:15 2015 UTC,I would so very much love a TLDR version of the Mars video.  Hard to get in to a 18 minute video on my lunch break.
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,runetrantor,27,Fri Jun 26 17:51:49 2015 UTC,"If it's easier, the 99 percent invisble podcast episode is the base of the video. Basically it explains what the vexillologists consider good rules to make flags, point to good example as well as train wrecks. It's pretty similar to the Hello Internet flags talk in this respect.  If I remember well both Grey and Roman Mars follow the same /r/vexillology subreddit and got at lot of inspiration from there.  Edit: spelling"
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,steeldraco,15,Fri Jun 26 18:08:11 2015 UTC,It's really cool to watch him do his show live. And to see how nervous he is. I love Mars. His voice is just so soothing.
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,runetrantor,13,Fri Jun 26 19:31:00 2015 UTC,"Grey said he may re-visit the topic later. He has not seen the video, either. He said he won't watch it because he doesn't want to 'steal' anything from him if he does decide to revisit the topic. He said he presumes they were both referencing the same source material, and Brady, who has watched the video, basically confirmed that.  I haven't watched the video either, but I may at some point. Regardless, I would like to see Grey's video, too. I like seeing multiple points of view on the same topic, even if they largely agree or point out the same thing.  I don't avoid videos from Minute Physics just because I already saw a video from Dirk at Verstablium about a similar/same topic."
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,Jowitz,7,Fri Jun 26 20:27:15 2015 UTC,Please tell me I'm not the only one commenting on Dirk's videos saying I really like Veristablium!
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,cpcallen,5,Fri Jun 26 20:45:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair to Mars, Grey relented on using the term ""scooped"", saying instead that Mars and himself used the same ""source material"", leading inevitably to producing similar products."
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,thebhgg,3,Fri Jun 26 19:58:36 2015 UTC,Ohhh... I remember Grey talking about flags on Hello Internet but must have missed that explanation.  I am a little behind on my Greyology...
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,rumor33,22,Fri Jun 26 17:34:22 2015 UTC,It makes me laugh thinking of a stick figure with glasses shaking its fists at Roman Mars' Ted Talk.
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,NAG3LT,12,Fri Jun 26 17:08:46 2015 UTC,"Weeks later, and the MARS video is still only around 110,000 views.  I know it's too late by a mile, but a CGP treatment of flag design would probably still get a lot more."
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,intenselyseasoned,33,Fri Jun 26 18:09:31 2015 UTC,"It would seem strange to me, since Grey has stated many many times during the Hello Internet podcast that A) he tries to avoid making videos about ""present"" topics because B) he does not follow the news very much and C) he prefers to treat ""settled"" topics rather than ""on-going"" ones."
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,intenselyseasoned,288,Fri Jun 26 17:02:58 2015 UTC,"he prefers to treat ""settled"" topics rather than ""on-going"" ones.   This video stops at 1865."

CGPGrey,3b7lx3,JustinKSU,32,Fri Jun 26 19:52:24 2015 UTC,"Well, while this relates to current issues, the video itself doesn't really address those topics. The designs of the many different confederate flags were settled long ago. Also, I think greys love of flags might have won out a bit here."
CGPGrey,3b7lx3,VERNEJR333,58,Fri Jun 26 17:08:18 2015 UTC,I do love flags.

CGPGrey,3b6w79,ohfouroneone,4,Fri Jun 26 19:44:48 2015 UTC,They wouldn't have his shade of black.
CGPGrey,3b6w79,sifex,29,Fri Jul 3 03:27:41 2015 UTC,I really wanna know how Grey got to where he is in London. He is from New York and he also lived and has a Ireland passport and now lives in London? How did that happen? What drew him to keep moving around especially the initial jump across the Atlantic Ocean. Super curious because this is something my husband wants to do.
CGPGrey,3b6w79,ladyflyer88,3,Fri Jun 26 19:37:37 2015 UTC,"In older episodes of HI (look for the ones where he and Brady talk about schools/ the uselessness of language classes a lot), as well ad one of the Q&A videos, he said that he got a masters in Physics, and then saw that the UK needed physics teachers among (I guess around the early 2000s) amongst other thing, I bet, so he went over the ocean, got his teaching license for England, and in 2012, his side project's success changed his life forever.

CGPGrey,3b6w79,kuzared,2,Fri Jun 26 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"Just to chime in - I've been eating Joylent (there are a couple of others from Europe, Queal and Jake for instance) for the past month on-and-off, mainly as a snack while at work, though sometimes as a full meal as well. I've been quite satisfied with it for all of the reasons /u/elliotttruska listed, the biggest being decision fatigue of all things, followed by time saving."
CGPGrey,3b6w79,elliottruzicka,3,Fri Jun 26 22:16:55 2015 UTC,"So you would be interested? It's only a matter of time now before it's available in Europe.  Personally, I'm having a great time with it."
CGPGrey,3b6w79,AutomatonEmbalmed,2,Tue Jun 30 10:31:01 2015 UTC,"can you explain more about how it works for you, do you have more time or something?"
CGPGrey,3b6w79,elliottruzicka,5,Fri Jun 26 18:46:57 2015 UTC,"I usually use it for eating at work. It works well for me in five ways:    1) I don't have to lose money by taking a lunch (I don't get a paid lunch) because I just pull it out of the fridge and drink it at my workstation. 2) I don't have to break my budget spending money on dining or takeout every day. 3) I can eat healthy and feel healthy consistently, and watch my calorie intake more easily (I literally weigh out my calories). 4) I don't get tired of eating it in the same way I might get tired of eating from the same restaurant every day (because 'bland' food does not suffer the same 'getting tired of it' effect that exotic or heavily flavored foods do). 5) I don't have to suffer from decision fatigue by choosing what I want to eat every day, since the decision has already been made."
CGPGrey,3b6w79,happy_spanners,3,Fri Jun 26 19:09:17 2015 UTC,"When you buy it how long does it last? Could I keep it around for the occasions when I don't have time or can't be bothered to cook?   EDIT: I just watched the video on their site, apparently it lasts up to 2 years."
CGPGrey,3b6w79,AutomatonEmbalmed,2,Fri Jun 26 19:26:47 2015 UTC,"1) is it overall cheaper? like, how much does it cost to eat/drink/use soylent for a week? 3) i dont know for sure, but isnt it healthier to have a varied diet? Or is that a myth? 4) wouldnt bland food get boring even faster? 5) i can totally get the ease of not having to decide stuff for every meal thanks, im definitely looking into this!"
CGPGrey,3b6w79,elliottruzicka,3,Sat Jun 27 11:46:38 2015 UTC,"1) Since I use between 500-1000 cal per day at work, this works out to between $2.50-$5.00 per day. 3) Normally a varied diet is generally healthier simply because a given meal is never nutritionally balanced on its own. Different types of food are needed to make up that imbalance (quite crudely and unreliably). Soylent however IS nutritionally balanced. Variation is not a virtue on its own. 4) Just the opposite. The phenomenon is called sensory-specific satiety, and is only activated with flavor. Since Soylent is about as flavor-neutral as you can get, the phenomenon does not take effect (especially after a week or two of occasional use). In fact, positive conditioning may take place, as the body is associating a specific food (Soylent) with nutrition and health. 5) Yes, decision fatigue is a thing, everyone. It can lead to stress and lethargy. Avoid it."

CGPGrey,3b6w79,rumor33,3,Fri Jun 26 17:24:59 2015 UTC,In regards to Grey getting help with his videos- He did employ an illustrator to help with some of the graphics on the latest politics in the animal kingdom video. Was that an exception to the negitive help rule or did it ultimately end up being more trouble than it was worth?
CGPGrey,3b6w79,NorwegianWood28,2,Fri Jun 26 21:04:03 2015 UTC,I'm interested in this too. I remember him saying that he had to go back and forth with the artist a few times to nail down the design of the animals. I am also curious why he elected to make actual artistical productions of the animals instead of the more stick-figure type stuff that he usually does.
CGPGrey,3b6w79,maps_a_plenty,2,Fri Jun 26 22:36:39 2015 UTC,"Here's a Grey question: you mentioned that you have been doing a faster animating routine for the last 3 videos. They've all been a similar animating style (all hail the triangle people) vs. something like the Animal Kingdom STV video. Is doing more videos like this over time making the animating process shorter (using previous animation stock, established style, etc)? Or could you just as easily animate in a different format?"

CGPGrey,3b6w79,sluuuurp,3,Fri Jun 26 23:45:02 2015 UTC,I think it's because he doesn't organize things in his notes app. He just spits out thoughts into Notes and then organizes them later.

Once you know your measurements and what you like in terms of cut and fabrics, in the future you can usually simply order more shirts by email and only need to meet your tailor once to pick up and pay. Money has its perks.   (I find it equally likely that you had a blind spot for this solution, or that you are dryly informing me that of course you thought of this and decided against it :S )"

CGPGrey,3b6w79,Nabokovian97,7,Fri Jun 26 23:42:08 2015 UTC,I think you should ask James Grime where he gets his shirts. He's always nicely dressed.

My Episode 4 Live Blog:  I too have always wished my iPad icons could rotate in place. I spend too much time making my home screen beautiful to have it ruined by screen rotation.  Grey is killing my phone data plan by releasing these podcasts an hour after I leave for work and I have to download them on cellular. So if you could retailor your release schedule to fit my work schedule that'd be great thanks.   If Grey wants to make more money he could start releasing a daily vlog.
CGPGrey,3b6w79,narbris,2,Fri Jun 26 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"I actually keep my iPad locked in the landscape view like 99.99999% of the time.   Also, it's times like these I am glad I am on a cheap unlimited data plan ;D"

CGPGrey,3b6w79,nicholas818,10,Fri Jun 26 19:17:36 2015 UTC,I was just about to release a podcast about phone-wallpaper alignment -- scooped again!
CGPGrey,3b6w79,Blimundus,12,Fri Jun 26 19:05:05 2015 UTC,"You describe your Apple watch, as if it were your daemon of Panserbjørne armor."
CGPGrey,3b6w79,ohfouroneone,10,Fri Jun 26 13:58:35 2015 UTC,Are you saying it isn't?
CGPGrey,3b6w79,mikeyReiach,19,Fri Jun 26 16:58:29 2015 UTC,"I poked around about what was happening with the wallpaper alignment issue.  It appears that the only way to have perfect alignment is to have Reduce Motion turned ON.  If you don't something will always move.  Specifically:   Reduce Motion ON, Perspective Zoom (N/A): Wallpaper doesn't move, icons don't move.  Perfect alignment possible. Reduce Motion OFF, Perspective Zoom ON : Wallpaper moves, icons move.  Alignment impossible. Reduce Motion OFF, Perspective Zoom OFF : Wallpaper doesn't move, icons move.  Alignment impossible.   You can see the difference here.  The visual differences are indicated in this image as black lines, grays are unchanged.  So no matter what—unless Reduce Motion is turned ON something will move.  Whether that be just the icons (PZ OFF) or both wallpaper and icons (PZ ON).    Clearly the only way forward is to use a black wallpaper—like a gentleman ;)  [Tested on iOS 8.3]  {Edit: Fix Typo}"
CGPGrey,3b6w79,imyke,7,Fri Jun 26 20:44:45 2015 UTC,I should've known you could solve this _
CGPGrey,3b6w79,rumor33,2,Fri Jun 26 18:28:33 2015 UTC,"Typo in your second sentence: reduce motion ON. And yes, I also have a top row of your invisible icons together with a black background!"
CGPGrey,3b6w79,imyke,9,Fri Jun 26 19:04:18 2015 UTC,"Hey, I found Grey's wallpaper first :(  I disagree with your alignment gripe. When things are grossly misaligned, they look terrible. If they're close, you won't notice it most of the time."
CGPGrey,3b6w79,Evlmnkey,20,Fri Jun 26 18:45:22 2015 UTC,"About Perspective Zoom:  Disabling it only affects whether the wallpaper itself will move around.  To stop EVERYTHING, I believe you have to go to Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion."
CGPGrey,3b6w79,thellamasc,2,Fri Jun 26 15:03:25 2015 UTC,Is there a way to prevent the screen and the icons shifting left and right when dragging it?
CGPGrey,3b6w79,thellamasc,3,Fri Jun 26 14:24:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is. As opposed to a lot of other mobile developers, Apple makes a point of letting users scroll a little bit past the point where the content ends so they translate that there's no more content (since there isn't a scrollbar)."
CGPGrey,3b6w79,JulitoCG,10,Fri Jun 26 15:14:15 2015 UTC,You know what's kinda funny. Listening to this ep at work when Grey is talking about letting something sit before posting the next day. I had a little thought in the back of my head to check OmniFocus.  -- Made a draft of an important email days ago to be sent today and if it wasn't for the podcast I would have forgotten. You're helping the world mates.

CGPGrey,3b6w79,shelvac2,9,Fri Jun 26 16:43:49 2015 UTC,"Was this internationally posted on a posting day?

CGPGrey,3b6w79,suhsyrup,11,Fri Jun 26 17:15:30 2015 UTC,Not on my part. I had no idea about that video. That Grey is sneaky.
CGPGrey,3b6w79,imyke,10,Fri Jun 26 18:47:38 2015 UTC,I didn't know about this video when we recorded either.

CGPGrey,3b6w79,thellamasc,7,Sat Jun 27 17:58:48 2015 UTC,I feel like I should comment something to make Grey notice how things are going with this episode... But I cant think of anything. It seems good. I want more show-notes I guess?
CGPGrey,3b6w79,imyke,8,Fri Jun 26 23:31:44 2015 UTC,"Another? ...guys, I don't feel comfortable listening without getting on Patreon. It's wrong otherwise, I'm unworthy of the bountiful two weeks or so we've had!"
CGPGrey,3b6w79,thellamasc,17,Fri Jun 26 14:38:47 2015 UTC,Grey (cortex ep.1): I've only agreed to 10 episodes.   Grey (cortex ep. 4): that's a topic for another episode (by my count said about 4 different times)  I am ok with this.
CGPGrey,3b6w79,pobopny,2,Fri Jun 26 15:47:12 2015 UTC,I wonder how many times they have said that so far.

CGPGrey,3b6w79,TheJoonbug,7,Fri Jun 26 23:10:38 2015 UTC,One thing that struck this episode is a big advantage this has over HI is that Myke is not (as far as I know) a youtuber. As an outsider in this respect he opens up a lot more questions which would not otherwise be asked.  HI will always be no.1 in my heart though.
CGPGrey,3b6w79,squamosal,6,Fri Jun 26 16:53:01 2015 UTC,Could the wallpaper misalignment thing have to do with Myke having 2 pages of apps?
CGPGrey,3b6w79,imyke,13,Fri Jun 26 21:48:31 2015 UTC,I think I'm a lost cause at this point
CGPGrey,3b6w79,etherealwinter,3,Fri Jun 26 13:42:43 2015 UTC,"I use the Cortex background, and only have one pages of apps, and the apps still move and result in misalignment."
CGPGrey,3b6w79,imyke,2,Fri Jun 26 14:22:07 2015 UTC,Perhaps Grey has Reduce Motion enabled?
CGPGrey,3b6w79,etherealwinter,3,Fri Jun 26 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"I think you're talking about a ""finished"" bottom or straight hem to your shirts, /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels. Like this.  Also, polyester greatly helps to not have wrinkles. You might only want to do 35% poly' 65% cotton to keep from sweating a lot; even that much will majorly help prevent wrinkles."

CGPGrey,3b6w79,Iceyeeye,3,Sat Jun 27 10:37:07 2015 UTC,"I was wondering about your use of skippable and non skippable adds. Do you turn them off early on so the video is more likely to be spread? I am just looking at it from how I watch videos. If I am watching a video within the first 24 hours of it being posted, I am probably subscribed and have been waiting for this content. This makes me more likely to stick around through the add. The further away from the release date I am watching a video, the more likely it is that I am either not subscribed to the channel or am binge watching one of my subscribed channels. In both of these scenarios, skippable adds are more likely to turn me away from the content. I'm not saying to change what you are doing, just wondering what made you decide this. Thanks."

Much easier than ironing (which you don't do, but I imagine you don't do it because it's not easy) and for me at least the results are much better.  And if you don't normally wear a collared shirt, it's 30 seconds of work each time you feel like dressing up, so even less work. It's a lot easier than starting your own shirt company."

Physics, systems, etc. Not to mention, neither contains Cracked's podcast, which he has recommended on Hello Internet, and whom he specifically tried to suggest a solution for their main problem, which is that their executive editor lives in Tennessee instead of Los Angeles, so they record his voice over the phone, which many people find awful.   /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels did what he does best and put forth the fruits of his research, namely that they could record on both ends via computer microphone and stitch the two together. And neither podcast has mentioned this exchange, but nevertheless, here is the first episode where they did that exact thing."

The need for physical human contact in the development of empathy is vitally important. Thanks to lawsuits and the like, we're already screwing that up by stopping teachers and caregivers from touching kids. It's a major issue. If anything, as (recently) a high school physics teacher, I'd say it makes a lot more sense to replace high school teachers than teachers of little kids. Little kids need more management, and have more to gain from human contact since their brains are doing so much of their development work.

CGPGrey,3ayhj8,Ivancloak,11,Thu Jun 25 14:52:45 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you say that people who explore various rainforests and other inhospitable places are explorers? Surely they are mostly botanists, entomologists etc., but they are also going to places where  no man ever set foot and exploring new plants, insects and animals, as well as probably mapping the area. They don't have a flag and a sword (except machete perhaps?), but wouldn't they still qualify as explorers? You can't explore places like rainforests with nothing but satellites, and I would say that robots and drones also wouldn't last long in such environment."
CGPGrey,3ayhj8,theskymoves,10,Wed Jun 24 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"When the idea of modern explorers came up, I immediately thought: rainforests and oceans.

Especially because of how many new animal species get discovered from the ocean every year."
CGPGrey,3ayhj8,blatherlikeme,5,Thu Jun 25 02:48:22 2015 UTC,"Deep sea scientists are definitely explorers in the sense of the word that Brady is talking about.

""  We have mapped a ridiculously small percentage of the ocean bed, and we honestly have no idea what kind of beings it might foster.  So the age of exploring is definitely not over Brady, it's just a little more wet :) . And you might need to compromise with the motor."

CGPGrey,3ayhj8,Thatwindowhurts,12,Mon Jun 29 13:26:32 2015 UTC,"High School Grey on Pledges  As to why I'm interested in CGP Grey's system of working and not someone like Destin (or Duke from Vatican - nice one Brady):  As it stands now, in high school and at the start of university I was very inefficient but ultimately effective. It involved procrastinating really hard even while working.  This forced me into a state where I was basically always working or thinking about working during the day. It was ultimately taxing, but effective, I got very good results.  I eventually could no longer perform like this, and my results took a nosedive.  The nosedive was not a result of the work getting harder or an increasing amount of work. The nosedive happened with my workload remaining basically constant. It was a breakdown in my poorly managed system.   In way too many words, I had pretty severe burn out.  The terms Gray described his life before GTD highly resonated with me and how I feel like I currently perform. I am no longer reliable and I'm often kind of scattered. I like Gray no longer have an interest or even ability to force myself to work all day and all night. I want to make it as easy as possible to get work done when I can and to concentrate on work when I decide to work. Why? Because I also have always been very ambitious and still have high demands on myself. Grey seems to share, in some ways, these aspects of my personality."

In the West of Ireland it's tradition to have someone with the body at all times, so close family or friends take it in shifts to sleep next to the coffin for a few hours each from death to burial. I think it's so the soul can't leave, but not sure on that one. I kinda like that as a tradition tho. Think it makes death more meaningful and real for all involved."
CGPGrey,3ayhj8,AndreFSR,3,Wed Jun 24 19:39:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say the majority of catholic funnerals have some portion within the home of the dead individual, in Ireland that is.

The music sounds really different: heavier on the guitar and less electronics, some improvisation, some cool jams between songs. Plus the visual spectacle. It really is an experience.  However, it does boil down to how willing someone is to standing for a long period of time, in close proximity with many other human beings, jumping around, screaming and all that. It does sound like Grey's nightmare. For me it really has to be a great band to make me leave my comfort zone like that.  Btw, when I saw ""Brady's music"" in the description, I just had an hunch that you would be into Muse. What did you think of the latest album?"

I've considered buying a seat for Brit Floyd, because it's a calmer experience, but ended up not going.

We've got little games on PowerPoint which we play to take up time, (usually only the mission operators, not operators) and while I can't actually listen to the podcast while flying a real mission (against the rules), I did enjoy listening while in the simulator, and got very annoyed when you had a episode which was only 45 mins.

When a person dies, they keep some kind of wake (we call it ""priveghi"", i can't find a better way to describe it in english) in the house of the deceased, where everybody can see them before they are walked to the grave... two days later."

Perhaps it's a function of rural culture.   I find that so strange that my Co workers here in the UK haven't even seen a dead body, when kissing the forehead of a family member at a open casket wake is so common at Catholic funerals!"
CGPGrey,3ayhj8,Chrad,3,Wed Jun 24 18:08:46 2015 UTC,"Brady: I definitely sympathize with the toothbrush thing, but to me that just means I shouldn't throw out my manual. I use my electric maybe 75% of the time, and use my manual when a) I feel like being more aggressive or b) when I'm short of time and just need to do a rough job.   I also always put it straight on the charger after use -- that's just where it lives. So that way I never really have to think about charging. If I remember correctly, I think we have the same brand of toothbrush (Oral-B, was it?)  It's a hard adjustment though. It feels like it can't possibly be cleaning my teeth properly without any pressure, but I know intellectually it is."

I made those changes to make it even more CGP Grey-esque. As a railway videographer, the icons on the left and right of the dock are links to two websites related to railway news and timetables.  As for Google Drive, yes I really do use it enough to give it prime position. As a student, I use it for EVERYTHING across multiple Google accounts for uni and personal stuff.

Grey said he actually had a good reason but he wanted to save it for the podcast... so now I really have to know! Cash stash hype!"
CGPGrey,3aeidp,smd_ksu,9,Sat Jun 20 19:28:52 2015 UTC,"You're doing a good job here.  For the links, I'd suggest linking to the specific show reddit thread in the future, but that's fairly minor.  I'm a Windows user, so I've got different software considerations, but for audiobooks, I definitely use software to speed up audio and pare down silence.  Foobar has good plugins for cutting silence, but it's speedup alters pitch.  I can use Audacity which has a speedup feature which doesn't alter pitch, but it requires re-writing the files (or playing them through Audacity, and it's not great as a player), and as you can imagine takes some time to process and some space to re-save the files.  The time is the bigger annoyance, even with a fast machine, 16+ hour audiobooks can take some time, so usually I just suffer through a bit of pitch increase with my speed increase rather than wait through the prep time.  None of this is useful for streaming, of course, but I tend to listen to downloaded or media-based content, and have some (rational and irrational) biases against streaming services.  Relay.fm's web player has three speeds, 1x, 1.5x, and 2x - those are bafflingly useless.  It's a shame, because they're pitch-corrected.  They should probably be 1x, 1.1x and 1.15x or something like that."

So long as you aren't venturing into unchartered territory and downloading particularly exotic Cydia apps, there really isn't any added security risk."

I use Mr Siri often to set timers and alarms, make notes, and to call and text people. I'm always curious about more ways to use this feature and shocked most people seem to not use it at all."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,brain4breakfast,2,Sat Jun 20 20:23:29 2015 UTC,"In HI Grey has said something like; if you've ended up relying on your self control to keep you doing, or from doing, something then you have failed. In this latest Cortex he showed an example of that with removing the browser from his iphone. In the end though isn't he just using his self control from reinstalling safari or from eating bacon all day? What would he say is the ratio between gimmick and self control that keeps him running?  Lastly, just how does he develop his self control gimmicks? From identifying the problem to solution, what are his steps?"
CGPGrey,3aeidp,DylanZed,2,Sun Jun 21 02:08:31 2015 UTC,"I second this as a good starting place for a podcast discussion. One of the themes I've been able to take from Grey talking about productivity is the idea of friction. So far they've talked about how he makes it really low friction to do work -- Namely, having a bag staged with everything needed to work, all ready to go every morning. Removing the browser is the opposite -- reinstalling it is possible, but it's jumping through enough hoops that the instant gratification/check-social-media impulse factor isn't there.  It's the same idea as not keeping snacks in the house when you are dieting."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,TheGrammarFreak,2,Tue Jun 23 23:30:07 2015 UTC,"I'm a researcher so I have to get a lot of self guided work done much like a self-employed person, I really enjoy and potentially get a lot out of this podcast. However I'm not an apple user and I'm very unfamiliar their entire ecosystem. Could you try your best to talk in more general terms about what the various apps and systems do and if you do know about android/windows/google alternatives then even a passing mention would be helpful to people like me (I cant be the only one can I?).  I also have a suggestion pertaining to the homescreen grading that Myke and Derek suggested early on in the show. Perhaps a more interesting alternative to this would be to look in detail at an android/windows/google alternative to all of these systems and have grey look through it in detail on the show and comment on it. You could have a competition or use reddit to select a power user with an advanced and complete setup and examine the best/most popular one.  Finally, I'm a neuroscientist and I have a suggestion for grey's alarm clock issue... http://www.amazon.co.uk/Zeo-Sleep-Manager-Personal-Coach/dp/B002IY65V4 This is a very comfortable headband that you wear to sleep and it tracks your sleep cycles using a basic EEG sensor. I borrowed one from a lab I used to work in and found it really effective. The phone and fit-bit approaches to this are just pale imitations as they estimate your sleep cycle very indirectly. They seem to be unavailable on amazon now but I remember they were only about £100 so there's bound to be some out there somewhere."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,After_Dark,68,Sun Jun 21 11:59:55 2015 UTC,"I commented on the last podcast and I'd like to expand on what I said last time here. I am not hating, I'm trying to be constructive.  There is still something about the dynamic that makes me uncomfortable and I think I now know what it is: The founding assumption that Grey is some almost-infallible productivity wise man on the hill.   Yes, I am interested in what Grey has to say, but it makes me uncomfortable to listen to what seems to be such an unbalanced conversation. There is no challenge to anything Grey says. Myke comes across (to me) like a fan rather than an equal. How long will it be till Myke proudly tells Grey he has only 3 items in his dock. Will he have deleted his iphone browser by episode 4?  Grey seems to have some well thought through systems in place, and they work for him, but they should be a topic of discussion, not a prescription. Presumably Myke also has motivation for having done things differently from Grey, and the merest damning on grey's behalf shouldn't be enough to change Myke's entire work flow, that just seems... I don't know.  I am posting this for the sake of discussion, I am interested as to how other people feel about this even if it may be an unpopular view."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,TheGrammarFreak,36,Fri Jun 19 21:08:23 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who didn't know who CGP Grey was until Hello Internet was mentioned on one of Myke's podcasts, I see Myke as being more enthusiastic and interested in processes than being fanboyish.  Myke is already extremely productive. Relay.fm is actually the second podcast network that he's started. There's over a dozen shows and Myke is a host on about seven of those shows.  So in my opinion, Myke's interest isn't so that he can become productive. It's professional curiosity; it's fun to see how other people work.  As far as when he'll go to three icons in the Dock, my wager is: Never. Myke said in the last two episodes that wasting that prime real estate in the dock is ridiculous.

CGPGrey,3aeidp,walexj,7,Sat Jun 20 03:21:31 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it will feel less one-way in the next few episodes, where the feedback section will let Myke re-vist and challenge some of what they've already covered.  Also, they're only doing 10 episodes, and with feedback they have about 60-75 minutes to cover new topics per episode. It could be that there isn't a ton of back-and-forth because the guys want to cover a lot of ground first, and maybe revisit certain areas more in-depth later? Just an idea.  I do also think there's a certain tongue-in-cheek recognition of the absurdity of taking Grey to be a Productivity Guru in the podcast -- I hear it in the way Grey dryly chastises Myke for not yet escaping the barbarism of the four-app dock. The show may as well be called ""Grey's Systems"" (and not ""How to Be Productive"") and that's on purpose. It's kind of reminiscent of Hypercritical, where the main attraction was to hear Siracusa do his famous complaining. Dan gave lots of input of his own to the show but his role was primarily to be the director.  That said, I do agree that I'd like to hear Myke be a foil to Grey more often. That's what makes HI fun after all!"

I fully appreciate that there are heavy transition costs moving around between devices, and that leveraging the Apple ecosystem across everything is beneficial and that the ecosystem itself has its advantages ('advantages' is read Omnifocus in Grey's world.)   That said, I could not help but laugh ever so slightly at Grey's description of the perfect iPad, as I listened to the podcast on my Microsoft Surface Pro 3. For the uninformed, this is a laptop/tablet hybrid, made by Microsoft. It is running the full Windows operating system (meaning full multi-tasking/access to applications); it has an integrated stylus which is a digitizer (meaning it does not suck); it is a 12 inch, less than 2lb device. It is also comparable in price to the iPad.   I hope for your sake you get the iPad of your dreams, and this is in no way a recommendation to switch (see the disclaimer paragraph), but I found it slightly humorous."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,lvlierop,9,Sat Jun 20 00:48:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, made me laugh too. I think there are some pretty horrible trade offs when you go all in on an ecosystem, this being a prime example. It seems to me that the device that Grey wants exists, but he ""can't"" use it."

In all seriousness though, you're right. You gotta weigh the benefits and detriments to going all in on an ecosystem and which ecosystem you pick.   Apple: Good all around, but you cannot ever play nice with any other devices ever. Also you do it Apple's way or not at all. Microsoft: General good support for everything, but generally not as good as Google or Apple in quality of services. Also a nearly empty app selection. Google: Good support for all platforms (except the Windows Store, fuck that) and by far the ""smartest"" services as well as the largest number of them, but frequently mediocre mobile implementation Amazon: HAHAHA, yeah, sure, someone'll be exclusive to this one day Fire Phone cries in a corner"

CGPGrey,3aeidp,Mythmaze,5,Sat Jun 20 23:46:06 2015 UTC,"OK, I've got a complaint and/or comment. First time (I think) that I've ever had strong feelings about something Grey says that isn't your average internet reaction.  It is fundamentally flawed to think of jailbreaking your phone as decreasing your security in any way. This is Re: Grey says he doesn't want to jailbreak the phone/iPad to resolve his niggles with it because of security concerns. This is simply not how it works. There is no monotonic increase in insecurity from unjailbroken to jailbroken. There is no monotonic decrease either. Every computer system should always be treated as if it has already been compromised. One security hole - and I assure you that every device you have that holds important information has at least dozens that are being actively exploited - makes your entire system 100% insecure.  So it's a completely moot point to say you have security concerns about jailbreaking. Some of the biggest, most prominent and valuable information leaks are from large databases compiled by trusted corporations, either through their personnel files, backend computers or customer data. Do you want all of CGP Grey's data? Well, let's go and have a look if we can SQL our way into Omni Group's servers! Ah, there we go, we just asked an employee for the root password by offering him money.  Security is a lot like quantum physics; it's confusing, complicated and most of all entirely unintuitive. You cannot use everyday analogies with security. A tiny pinhole in your digital dam can be much more devastating than a gaping hole.  This all gets particularly egregious because Grey bets so much of his life on one horse, so it only takes a tiny pinhole to drain away all of his life's work. The best bet for securing your digital life is to    1) spread your risks (and data) 2) orthogonalize your access (i.e. using uncorrelated passwords, requiring multi-factor authentication) and  3) diversify your access (make sure you can get access to your stuff in a couple different ways, so when your favourite company finally decides to go evil or bankrupt, you're not left without any means to do your thing)"

I've played around with it, and I can tell why people might like to listen at 1.5x (podcasts are a time-consuming interest, after all), but things can get a bit jumbled at times, causing me to skip back by ten seconds to catch a snippet of dialogue again. 2x seems just crazy-pants, though.  I understand that Overcast has some sort of sped-up playback as a feature; is that significantly better to the point of alleviating the problem?  EDIT: Aaaaand it turns out they talk about this exact thing around 1:10.  ALSO EDIT: Because it seems to be The Thing to DoTM, phone home screen.  Screen to the left is mostly a calendar, with controls for podcast and music players below. Chrome removed because its functionality for me (quick searches) is supplanted by the bar at the top. Considering changing my background to something more symmetrical/patterned/regular. Still trying to cut down on the number of icons in the four folders."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,boxlessthought,2,Fri Jun 19 19:59:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I'm not the biggest fan of how Overcast organizes podcasts and playlists, but it's aesthetics and Smart Speed keep me using it. It's brilliant. Just buy it, you won't regret it. I've saved 30 hours with Smart Speed over a few months."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,whizbanger,2,Fri Jun 19 20:13:00 2015 UTC,"I'd love to invest in Overcast, but it's iOS-only. No luck for an Android user (I was mainly asking about Overcast to gauge if that was the source of the praise for sped-up playback).  Can anybody vouch one way or the other for PocketCasts? I'm happy using Podcast Addict at the moment, but some type of ""smart speed"" might push me to switch to a new client."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,tempf1,2,Fri Jun 19 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"I used Pocketcasts for a long time on iOS and it's also great. It would be what I use if it weren't for Smart Speed. It's got the best podcast organization out there and Up Next, which is a killer feature for me. Highly recommended."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,AzraelCcs,2,Fri Jun 19 20:28:21 2015 UTC,"PocketCasts actually has the same functionality as ""Smart Speed"" as Overcast, and it's just an absolutely fantastic client.  Beautifully designed."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,kycjesus,2,Fri Jun 19 20:40:57 2015 UTC,"I like listening to thing a 2x speed (Youtube videos too!). At first it took a little getting used to, but you pick up an ear for it. I've also noticed (for me at least) that I need to dedicate my full attention to whatever's playing; if my focus wanders beyond the small margin I have, I have to jump back. Also, once you've ""tuned in"" to the 2x speed, the 1x speed just sounds excruciatingly slow and drawn out."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,SaunaChump,2,Fri Jun 19 20:27:23 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, why are you using the Verizon messaging app?"
CGPGrey,3aeidp,imyke,2,Fri Jun 19 21:19:59 2015 UTC,"It's the default for me, it's reasonably functional, and I haven't looked much into alternatives (have had this phone for a little over 2 months).  I could probably be convinced to adopt a different SMS app, but the switching costs (importing contacts, testing, etc.) are significant enough that I haven't played around with my options."
CGPGrey,3aeidp,SaunaChump,2,Fri Jun 19 21:31:23 2015 UTC,Could you run through how you go from launch pad to entering a time to a tracking app? I would be interested in using that for my employees and myself.
CGPGrey,3aeidp,fuddyduddybuddy,2,Fri Jun 19 20:36:55 2015 UTC,My solution wouldn't be any good for a group.
CGPGrey,3aeidp,contextsubtext,3,Fri Jun 19 20:54:24 2015 UTC,The company runs pretty autonomously but they are individually bad at tracking working hours. An automated one click system could improve that at least from a personal end. Is it simply IFTTT?

CGPGrey,3a4sfx,zachthe1337,22,Thu Jun 18 05:29:03 2015 UTC,All caps is actually fairly common for engineers and drafters.
CGPGrey,3a4sfx,Themata075,9,Wed Jun 17 13:20:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a theatrical technician, and after my drafting class at University all my hand written notes are in all caps, and therefore actually legible."
CGPGrey,3a4sfx,MabDarogan,15,Thu Jun 18 01:40:27 2015 UTC,My handwriting is also all in caps - product of being in the architecture industry. I kind of wished more people would write in caps - it's much easier to be read by others.
CGPGrey,3a4sfx,ForegoneLyrics,8,Wed Jun 17 13:56:05 2015 UTC,"This is actually provably false. Individual letter forms are easier to differentiate when in caps, but whole words are easier to understand in lower case or mixed case, as in normal writing/typography. This is because all-caps words become rectangles and lose their individual shapes, which are normally easily recognized by our brains without having to parse each letter."
CGPGrey,3a4sfx,mellowfish,3,Wed Jun 17 17:21:51 2015 UTC,Yes I see what you mean. I think when there is context - like a whole paragraph - it's easier to read lower/mixed cased words. But I just find most legal forms I have to fill out request you print in capital letters. And of course in the architecture/construction industry it's common practice to write in all caps as well. So in instances where getting the spelling precisely correct is necessary - it's probably best to print in all caps.
CGPGrey,3a4sfx,ForegoneLyrics,4,Wed Jun 17 17:47:39 2015 UTC,"In school papers we were often required to write in script, which never made sense to me. Letters like n, m and r are very easily mistaken and it's really hard to read."

Also, Grey's scare tactics definitely succeeded in getting me to sign up for Backblaze."
CGPGrey,3a4sfx,ForegoneLyrics,3,Wed Jun 17 13:50:26 2015 UTC,"Any plans to digitize paintings. Obviously it won't capture thick strokes of oil paint accurately but if paintings discolor, I don't think cleaning alone can bring back the colors perfectly either. Or can they?"
CGPGrey,3a4sfx,GlassOrange,6,Wed Jun 17 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"Yes they do digitize paintings. Many museums around the world already do it. The technology of digitizations has grown a lot over the years and they can now capture amazing detail. The gallery I volunteer at uploads digitized painting to Google Art Project - It's an amazing digital libraries of artworks, virtual tours and information from so many museums and galleries around the world in beautiful, crisp HD images. There is also Art Stor which is a huge digital catalog of millions of art and architectural works. Databases like these are honestly so amazing and made studying art history in school so much easier and better, and of course also help us document and preserve paintings that are often very hard to conserve. It also makes art lovers like me so grateful for science and technology that allows us to do these things."

CGPGrey,3a4sfx,carcerus,8,Wed Jun 17 17:25:43 2015 UTC,"Weird. As a (molecular) biologist I feel like I'm in this wounderous period of new discoveries. Brady even mentioned it: ""some protein being discovered..."" (or so he said). Right now the thing everyone seems to be talking about is CRISPR. It even made it to news and such. (which always fascinates me: ""hey, the thing my prof mentioned is in the news, weird)  The more I learn about molecular biology, I realise how much yet has to be discovered. It is astonishing and amazing, how all those small parts work together to form one working thing, that in turn is just another small thing to make a much larger system work.   But yes, it would be near impsossible to discover new things there in my garage or so. And yes, one does need some sort of  familiarity with the subject to understand those things. Otherwise it would just sound like: ""well this things binds to that thing, that in turns can bind to yet another thing, which makes the first thing even more likely to bind to the second thing""  But still, I feel like this wounderous age of discovery where you really get to the reality of things. Even more so in physics. I wouldn't want to trade in to live in the 1800's. In fact I would like to live in a future, where technology is further advanced and allows even more discoveries. But very fascinating to look at those old manuscripts and to think that those people where filled with the same sense of wonder as I am now.  TL;DR: holy cow, look at thatscience!  edit: Also interesting format. May I suggest this sort of thing for every 10th episode?"
CGPGrey,3a4sfx,Mcturtles,3,Wed Jun 17 21:18:03 2015 UTC,"Just listened to a radiolab episode on CRISPR a couple days ago! It was super interesting.   And I agree, I think that while the world changing discoveries are now made by huge teams of researchers with a whole bunch of special tools, the layman has the resources to learn all about them. When Newton was (co)inventing calculus and establishing much of contemporary physics, I doubt a significant portion of the population knew anything about it. Now with the internet and the general wealth of knowledge available, these monumental discoveries are open to anyone who wants to learn."

It's been so long ago I can't remember exactly what that episode was about.""  I closed my phone, got up, and after I'd caught up on my YouTube subscriptions over breakfast, was intrigued by the video thumbnail of the flag. I don't normally watch the videos as I've already listened to the podcast when it originally came out, but thought ""Looks different to the normal videos of office toys. I'll quickly click on the video and find out what it's about""  10 seconds later realise how mistaken I was to think that Grey's 80 point YouTube upload check list would ever allow a typo to occur.  I bet that checkboxes 6, 9 and 42 are all ""Make sure there is not a typo in the video title"""

CGPGrey,3a23po,LondonCallingYou,14,Fri Jun 26 01:38:55 2015 UTC,"It seems like over the past 25 years Italy moved from an entirely proportional system to one that guarantees that the plurality party will have a majority of the seats in the house. The wikipedia article makes it seem like the leading reasons are to increase stability and voter's distrust of parties.   I don't know how moving to the current system fixes the distrust problem (in fact it seems to make it worse).   I would like to see CGP Grey address the stability problem though. This seems very relevant in a prime minister system where stability is critical (as opposed to a Presidential system).  With the proportional results of the 2015 UK election Conservatives, UKIP, and LibDems would need to form a coalition in order to rule. That does not seem very stable at all."
CGPGrey,3a23po,cal_student37,4,Wed Jun 17 06:31:47 2015 UTC,"At the risk of my making an error it seems more that they tried to make a multiparty system majoritarian and failed multiple times. 1993 system was FPTP with a few proportional seats (supplementary member system, so not proportional overall). 2005 one was proportional with an automatic majority for the largest party overall (lower house) or per region (upper house). Neither achieved their goals and both look a bit  rubbish!  I think with stability it depends more on the individual politics of each country than the system itself. Japan has a system that results in the same party having a majority almost every time, which should be ultra-stable, but they still burn through prime ministers like nobody's business. Germany, by contrast, has the equivalent of a Con-Lab coalition and has perfectly stable government."
CGPGrey,3a23po,DunKhanate,3,Wed Jun 17 08:04:28 2015 UTC,"I would like to see CGP Grey address the stability problem though. This seems very relevant in a prime minister system where stability is critical (as opposed to a Presidential system).   In HI, he basically said that in 100% representative parliaments, parliaments will reach a common ground, at least in important matters.  I feel that doesn't take into account many things.  To use Italy again as an example: the parliament there can give a no-confidence vote to the prime minister, forcing him to resign, and if no replacement for the PM is found, another election is called.  A coalition (made of every major party except the communists) was the norm in the 80s, under the first postwar, highly representative voting system, but it didn't work out well, eventually.   This is not a specificity, it's pretty systemic in nature, and I feel this is the kind of issue Grey just plainly ignores when he speaks about voting systems. I think it's partly because he only ever witnessed political issues in the US and UK, which both have the issue of low representativeness, and also (by his admission) he has no interest in the peculiarities of each country's party system and political situation.  Voting systems don't exist in a vacuum, and there is no ""one-kind-fits-all"" type of voting system. This doesn't mean that the UK, US etc. voting systems are fine the way they are, but there are more things to consider than how well does it reflect the breakdown of the voters."
CGPGrey,3a23po,09876543212345,5,Wed Jun 17 08:40:01 2015 UTC,"The problem with the Italian political system in the era that led to mani pulite, though was a party one - there was a large communist party (PCI), and everyone else was committed to keeping them out of power at all costs.  Under that party situation, any other system would risk the communists getting into government, which would have been - in the view of the majority of Italians at the time - worse than the corruption. It's not the electoral system that created the problem; it's the fact that the PSI and PSDI wouldn't form a left-wing coalition with the PCI, which guaranteed that the Christian Democrats were in government forever.  Most PR systems stabilise as a number of left-wing parties, and a number of right-wing parties and the larger coalition gets into government. Voters can choose between the two coalitions, but can also choose between parties within the coalitions and therefore push the coalition in a direction they prefer (e.g. vote Green to increase the priority given to environmental issues within the left-coalition). This is pretty much how the Italian system works out these days.  Sometimes there are one or two smallish centrist parties, in which case the centrist parties choose whether to have a left or right coalition (usually by which one is more moderate); but if they annoy their voters when choosing, then they can be punished severely by the voters.  Occasionally you get a moderate-left-moderate-right coalition against the extremes, but these tend not to last.  Sometimes there is another issue that is more important to some voters than left or right, and they will accept a coalition of left-X with right-X against centre-not-X (you see this quite a bit in Israel, but to pick from a less controversial country, the Dutch purple coalitions were a coalition of secular parties against Christian parties)"
CGPGrey,3a23po,po8crg,5,Wed Jun 17 11:17:35 2015 UTC,"While he hasn't touched on the argument, Italy isn't a great example as they have perfect bicameralism, which means the government have to have have the confidence of both the upper and lower house, which is particularly problematic when the houses have a different composition, which in effect means that the government may need a much larger majority than in a normal system with one house or a weak upper house, like most parliamentary democracies. This would easily cause problems no matter what electoral system is used (see e.g the 2013 Government shutdown in the U.S).  Secondly, he doesn't seem to be a fan of pure party list systems like what Italy used either, as shown in one of his videos, his preferred systems, MMP and STV doesn't seem to have been causing less stability where they have been used compared to the UK."

CGPGrey,3a23po,intravenus_de_milo,60,Tue Jun 16 20:28:46 2015 UTC,"Grey echoed one of the things I have been complaining about for years: the concept of ""winning"" an election.  An election should not be a competition to find a winner, it should be a measure of the national opinion. However the language is always about winning or losing.  The previous election, the 2010 election, ended up with a government that better reflected the electorate than any for many decades, because the Blues and Oranges between them had about 60% of the popular vote. Even at the height of the Reds, at their landslide victory in 1997, they only got 45% of the popular vote.  The biggest problem with the FPTP system is that it is easy to gamify. The Blues approached the 2015 election like a video game, concentrating resources where the smallest efforts would yield the greatest gains. The swing to them was tiny, in fact in England, the swing to the blues was smaller than the swing to the reds, yet the blues gained more seats.  The blues played the system perfectly, and that's the problem with the current system - a skilled player of it can win big on it. But as I said, it shouldn't be about being a game people win, it should be about finding out what the people of the country want.  However, both the blues and reds will oppose scrapping FPTP because the system guarantees that the party in power will always be one of them, and they only have to wait for the electorate to get fed up of the other one before it's their turn again."

They formed a coalition, meaning the parties had a combined 60% of the popular vote and roughly the same proportion of the seats.  Compare this to 2015, where 36% of the vote gets 51% of the seats for the Tories, or 1997 where 43% of the vote got 63% of the seats (a huge majority) for Labour."

In a more directly educational context, political party names get in the way and could lead to the appearance that Grey thinks a system is broken because he doesn't approve of the politics of the winner, or the loser, or some other participant and that it'll just lead to a bunch of comments about the politics of the election rather than the system itself.  In the podcast, though, because it's an even less formal context, making a point of ""a party that I will not name (but which you know is the Conservatives or UKIP or the SNP) was elected or disproportionately underrepresented or disproportionately over-represented"" was something I found more distracting, in that it seemed like it was harder to keep track of than if the party names had just been used. Maybe because it was a recent, real world event and I kept having to process what I knew the results to be through an anonymity filter.  I completely understand the reason for maintaining the policy even in the podcast, as it keeps things neutral and more timeless and is very likely the proper way to do things.

I'm not a professional or anything, and it looks awful in Internet Explorer at the minute (and the map doesn't show on mobile) but I'd appreciate some thoughts. Cheers!"
CGPGrey,3a23po,mybumsonfire,16,Tue Jun 16 20:09:35 2015 UTC,"In the First Past the Post video, Grey explains how this system structurally creates and enforces a two party system.  Why is it that American FPP has resulted in a two party system but the UK's has not?  Is it just a matter of time before the UK only has two parties?"
CGPGrey,3a23po,Le_Pretre,29,Tue Jun 16 18:54:42 2015 UTC,"Several reasons.   The US system has a President.  If you're party #3 in the UK, you could get into government (like the Lib Dems did 2010-2015); if you're party #3 in the US you'll never get the President. Primaries. In the UK, the party organisation maintains a list of people allowed to stand as candidates; they kick out people who don't agree with the official positions of the party. In the US, this doesn't apply; anyone can stand in the relevant primary without an official endorsement. This means that very right-wing people and very left-wing people can support the main party and hope to get someone more right/left wing elected in the primary.  Look at groups like the Tea Party (on the right) and WFP (on the left). Similar people get pushed out of the big parties in the UK and end up as UKIP or the Greens (the Lib Dems are a bit more complicated but it's a similar dynamic). Nationalism. The UK is four countries and there are parties that operate in only one of the four. The US is 50 states and the only nationalist party I know of is the Alaska Independence Party, which is insignificant. If the AIP was a really big deal (complaining about the US sucking away Alaska's oil, for instance), then it could capture Alaska's representation in Congress. But I can't imagine any of the lower 48 being so politically distant from even their neighbouring states as to have wholly separate parties."
CGPGrey,3a23po,Thrash3r,5,Tue Jun 16 18:21:23 2015 UTC,"WFP (on the left)   Ooo! I got so excited to look for a party that is actually on the left in the US.  But googling only led me here.  Please tell me I'm doing it wrong, and not that you think the UN's World Food Program is some cray-cray left-threaded screwball that matches the tighty-righty wing-nut Tea Party."

That's right, a party that got less than half the number of votes as another one received more than 50 times the number of seats.  Completely absurd. The video seemed to focus on the bigger parties but honestly the SNP (a small party that got roughly 5% of the vote) was by far the biggest beneficiary."

In Norway, the votes for MPs are tallied at the county level, which makes it much easier to get a more representative parliament. In addition, parties who get more than 4% of the votes on the national level, and are under-represented because of the limited number of representatives from each county, are eligible for one of the 19 levelling seats."
CGPGrey,3a23po,Bluearctic,8,Tue Jun 16 21:11:08 2015 UTC,"I'm from the Czech Republic and here we have system with no local repesentatives. All the votes are counted together and seats in the parliament are divided acording to percentages as closely as it's possible. So, in theory a fair system (pie charts look almost the same), but here comes the catch:   Historically there are two parties on the left which get about 40%, two on the right which get about 40% and one (or two) in the middle which get about 20%. Thus, middle party makes coalition with whichever side it wnats and creates goverment with 60% support. And it does't metter whether left or right parties gained more because it all depends on the middle party (which is allways there with some low percentage). So again effectively 20% of people decide about goverment.  I'am not saying Grey isn't right but other systems do heve their problems as well."

CGPGrey,39l4l3,gerrygoo,4,Sat Jun 13 02:36:13 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not for everyone.  I only use a certain number of apps daily and they are always two clicks away.  Two clicks was a conscious decision. Otherwise I would have to add an extra row or my folders would get too big.    It comes down to how I use my phone.  I am really only running one app at a time. Most, like my podcast app, can be controlled in my lockscreen. So I really don't see a need to cover up beautiful Paris or my wallpaper du jour to add another widget and/or app icon."

CGPGrey,39l4l3,vmax77,35,Fri Jun 12 23:12:25 2015 UTC,Can I ask: why a £50 note specifically? Why not two £20s and a £10? Surely the £50 note is a little awkward to spend - like in a taxi - when you're paying for something relatively inexpensive which requires quite a lot of change?
CGPGrey,39l4l3,justarandomgeek,51,Fri Jun 12 16:27:44 2015 UTC,There is a good answer for this but I think I'll save it for the podcast. (If Myke remembers to ask me)
CGPGrey,39l4l3,sirroy12,40,Fri Jun 12 16:57:46 2015 UTC,I would guess that breaking a £50 would give enough resistance that you wouldn't be lazy and use it in a normal transaction. Which makes a £50 note as an attractive emergency fund.
CGPGrey,39l4l3,vmax77,5,Fri Jun 12 18:09:39 2015 UTC,"This is probably it. I too keep extra cash stashed in a few places, but if it's ""normal"" size bills it's too easy to spend it on normal stuff, which leads to not having it when you need it. Emergency stashes should be annoying/awkward to use for non-emergencies.  Also, given that he's carrying it everywhere, and frequently checking and re-checking it's presence, minimizing the number of distinct items is an advantage too."

CGPGrey,39l4l3,sirroy12,6,Fri Jun 12 18:02:13 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe not frowned upon, just kinda unusual."

It could be improved if you had a large bag which held your gym gear and then had a configurable smaller bag which held all the other things you might need that could be dropped into the larger pack. This is what they do in a lot of military's you have a day pack (45l) and a smaller scoot bag (15-20l). Both are essentially backpacks but carry complementary and not duplicate equipment.   That said your system is already in place and obviously works for you I just thought it could be something to review for you."

(eg, public playlists on Spotify)  I struggle with finding appropriate music to work to - many of the stock 'concentration' lists on such platforms are of either the sleeping or 'workout' extremes - we definitely need a greater pool of high-tempo, instrumental, yet unobtrusive audio to draw from.  COMMENT: Also, to all the haters. This show is everything I love about HI, minus the filler/flag-wankery. It's true that productivity is a niche interest, so this was never going to suit everybody - but for some of us this is a critical and burning issue, so discouraging its production will add no value to those that don't like it, while needlessly disadvantaging those that do.   Personally I've benefited a ton from the first 2 episodes - this is the podcast I've been waiting for for a very long time."

CGPGrey,39l4l3,TheInfiniteFish,14,Fri Jun 12 20:40:09 2015 UTC,"Before the most recent episode of HI, I really enjoyed the idea of this podcast, but now I feel sort of weird about Myke asking Grey about how to be more productive and efficient at working because I think we should have realised in the last episode of HI that Grey is in fact not productive or efficient at all. If Myke should be interviewing everyone, it should really be Brady because he is the one producing high quality videos constantly while still having a life.  Edit: Okay I think I was exaggerating and it is unfair to say that Grey is not productive or efficient at all. He obviously does produce high quality and well thought-out videos despite how irregularly and rarely he uploads. I wrote this comment mainly because I realised after the last HI episode that Grey is not actually the highly productive and efficient robot as he may first seem.  Just because he is very particular about his systems and stuff, doesn't mean that he has it all figured out and can teach us how to be 'flawless efficient work machines' (for lack of better words) since he really isn't, and Brady is probably closer to being a 'flawless efficient work machine' and more qualified to help the rest of us learn...  I don't know, this is just my weird, not completely thought out opinion and I apologise if anyone was offended."
CGPGrey,39l4l3,evilsupper,24,Fri Jun 12 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way: Say for example, that you're trying to lose weight. Do you want advice from someone who has never had problems staying thin? Would that person even know what that struggle feels like?      Grey is productive despite some tendencies that can sabotage productivity. He knows what that struggle feels like. I'm interested in what he has to say."
CGPGrey,39l4l3,mattyw83,7,Sun Jun 14 20:55:27 2015 UTC,"It feels like Grey has just given productivity in general more thought than the vast majority of people and has so many systems in place specifically for his productivity. I don't think most people could be interviewed in such a way about their work habits and have such specific answers to ""why do you do X?"" for so many X's. Grey gives the appearance that he's considered every aspect of his day to maximize his productivity, while someone like Brady seems to be productive, sure, but less deliberately so, and probably has fewer specific pieces of advice than Grey."
CGPGrey,39l4l3,SomeGoodInThisWorld,7,Fri Jun 12 18:43:50 2015 UTC,"As a previous commenter stated, Brady has never articulated his productivity; I doubt he's even intellectualized it. Naturally productive people don't have to.  I think we're seeing the general listenership divided into two camps; those who are interested in learning from Grey, and those who are interested in the spectacle. Both are equally valid.  Grey was a real revelation to me since productivity is something I've struggled with my whole life. Through compulsive perfectionism, difficulty managing multiple workstreams, and an easily disrupted attention span, I would typically average about 12 hours to accomplish what others could achieve in 8. I get the impression Grey struggles with something similar.   When you have this problem, SYSTEMS are the only thing that will give you your life back! (or at least your evenings and your weekends). Grey has become the grandmaster of systems, hence is the perfect teacher for this subject.  I do think it's unfair to suggest that Grey has less of a life because of his working methods, particularly since Brady's work is pretty much his hobby, so he doesn't necessarily have to discipline his monkey brain or optimise his environments for maximum output.   Systems are simply about maximizing output during working hours, precisely to free up those dedicated times for leisure and family etc people like Grey might otherwise have to sacrifice just to stay on top of the workload."
CGPGrey,39l4l3,Beika221B,3,Fri Jun 12 21:01:57 2015 UTC,"Are you sure Grey is that much less productive than Brady? They make such different videos that I don't think we can fairly compare them.  Grey produces denser videos, where every word is heavily researched and precise. The number of ideas-per-minute seem much higher to me. This takes more time, and many more drafts. Grey has said in the past that he can write fifty or more drafts for each video.  You can't compare number-of-videos produced without comparing their density. A vlogger could talk to a camera everyday without preparation (essentially a one-draft video, with little research) and release thirty videos per month. Meanwhile (humor me) Grey might write one draft per day, read several books for research, and release a single (thirty-draft) video during the same period.  In this fictional example the vlogger released thirty times more videos than Grey, but I wouldn't necessarily call them thirty times more productive. They both output the same number of drafts, but the vlogger's format suited less-precise (""conversational"" or ""sloppier"") output, so he/she released them immediately.  I'm living in a world with a serious overabundance of videos (and books, movies, music, comics...) to consume, so I find denser media far more valuable. I wish more YouTubers produced content as carefully prepared and dense as Grey's videos.  (Brady's output is of course much denser than the vlogger in my example, but it's not as far along the density continuum as Grey's output)    An alternative example: I just finished Command and Control by Eric Schlosser, a wonderful book. Apparently it took six years of research, much of which was because he was interviewing the people involved in the incidents. Some other writers have written four or five novels during that time. Can we compare their productivity? The heavily researched book, in many cases, was far denser of new ideas, and possibly more valuable.     I should also point out that I haven't listened to the episode of H.I. you're referring to, as I'm still finishing GTD, so he may say something to nullify everything in this comment. I'm happy to be corrected!"

I work in the heathcare industry, I have a husband, and a dog.  And I've now hit my 'wall' where my previous methods (aka, just remembering crap and not worrying about it) just aren't working.  When Grey talked about how he floated through high school and college with no incident, I definitely felt like that.  It wasn't until grad school - which I ultimately flunked out of due to poor task management and low motivation - that I really had any issues.  Big nebulous projects like a thesis are where my ""write down homework assignments and the date they're due"" just don't work anymore.  Problem is, I've tried a few times to implement the getting things done system, and every time I've failed for one reason or another.  First it was because I seriously lost the notebook I tried to write everything down in about every week.  Next was I never actually made time to go through all that info I wrote down.  Third is I've never actually found an organizational system to keep everything together that I actually like.  I've decided to try and actually implement the system again because I very recently missed a required training at work.  Which got me in huge do-do because I work in the healthcare industry and training is EVERYTHING.  Even if it's really stupid.  So I have to work on getting stuff together.  But I still can't get down the specifics.  I'm still having problems finding a way of organizing all the collected thoughts and what to do with that.  So I'm like Grey in that it's actually much more helpful to have people who implement the system show how it works for them and the specifics of that opposed to the nebulous ""have this tickler file thing"".  I still don't know if this system is really what's going to work for me as the key issue isn't actually the lack of organization but really the lack of motivation, and no organizational system is going to change that.  For example, I have no problem keeping track of all the dog training stuff I want to do, but that's mainly because I find dog training incredibly interesting while my job...not so much."

It is a fickle and unreliable little dickfuck and it isn't worth your time.   Better cultivate discipline than to rely on motivation. Force yourself to do things. Force yourself to get up out of bed and practice. Force yourself to work.   Motivation is fleeting and it is easy to rely on because it requires no concentrated effort to get. Motivation comes to you, you don't even have to chase after it. Discipline, on the other hand, is reliable, motivation is fleeting.   The question isn't how to keep yourself motivated, it is how to train yourself to work without it."

CGPGrey,395ydx,curiositykeeper,12,Tue Jun 9 19:42:53 2015 UTC,"Not to speak about Hello Internet specifically, but I listen to a lot of podcasts and I'm constantly dismayed at how bad podcasters are about this. Unfortunately, the only people who would notice and appreciate consistent metadata are obsessives and archivists like us.   I currently don't have a smartphone and I'll probably be unable to get one anytime soon, so the only way I can listen to podcasts are by downloading them, then loading the episodes to my old-school MP3 player. I've learned the hard way that once I commit to a podcast, I better download all the episodes that I can as quickly as possible.   Some podcasters put old episodes behind a paywall. Sometimes the episode download links get broken in a site redesign or a change in webhosts, and the podcaster understandably would rather spend the time producing new content, not fixing links. Sometimes podcasters will delete a controversial episode, replacing it with an edited version, if they replace it at all.   Anyway, it's incredibly frustrating to discover inconsistent metadata when I download a batch of episodes. Best is when the metafile is corrupted and you get an error message when you try and edit the metadata. There are some fixes that sometimes work, sometimes not.  I can live without the ""Year"" and ""#"" tags. The ""#"" tag is almost never used properly anyway. Anyone else have a zillion ""1"" episodes on their hard drive?   Sometimes there's nothing in the filename or the metadata to help you order the episodes chronologically. So either you rename/re-tag everything or you arrange the episodes by ""date modified"" and hope that the episodes downloaded in the right order.  Two of the most irritating metadata issues I've encountered:   One podcast had frequent short sub-episodes or supplementary episodes. The longer normal episodes had a filename like ""298_BrooklynBridge."" Sub episodes would be named ""298a_BridgeExtra."" The ""Title"" property in the metadata would match. No problem. Except that midway through the archive, the podcaster started naming sub-episodes as normal episodes. So ""298a_BridgeExtra,"" turns into ""299_BridgeExtra."" BUT, the ""Title"" property still followed the old convention! Super annoying if I'm trying to arrange a playlist and I'm only looking at the filename. Another podcaster frequently forgets to change the ""Title"" property in the Garage Band or wherever, when she exports the episodes, reusing the title from last week. So like five episodes in a row will have ""Podcast for 4 June 2015"" in the ""Title"" property.   TLDR: The most first-world of first-world problems. Thank you Grey and other podcasters for the free audio entertainment.   EDIT: Punctuation corrections."

I actually did the vast majority of the research for Chapter 14 in the new edition of the book (and it actually looks like David used a lot of my actual writing in the chapter itself). I've worked on projects for David Allen's company (I'm still engaged with one, actually) and have gotten fairly close to their CEO, Mike Williams, as well.  I'm a huge fan of the system and have been using it since 2007 (when I was being trained as a teacher, ironically). I've since worked as a teacher, stopped working as a teacher, and gotten deep into a PhD program in psychology while running my own coaching and consulting company thanks to GTD. There's no way I could've done any of that stuff without it (at least, not with any kind of sanity).  David Allen is a seriously goofy and nice guy and I just wanted to put the point out there that he's actually much more like Brady (kind of sentimental and spontaneous) than he is like Grey.   Anyway, great show as always."
CGPGrey,395ydx,nerdfighter123,20,Wed Jun 10 03:22:37 2015 UTC,"tl;dr - Everything Brady said about Getting Things Done is right and I'm going to try and do it anyway.  Brady is right!  The text is dry as the Gobi, the jargon is nigh impenetrable, and the label maker fetish... don't get me started.  However this is the system I am choosing to help me get a handle on my life and I will justify this decision in a few short paragraphs.  I will get a bit cheeky so take the serious bits serious and the hyperbole bits as humorous exaggerations.  I've gone through the audiobook version once and implemented some of the things already.  But this is going to be a do it again and again and again until I don't think I can stand it and maybe something that resembles the life I want to be living will come out of it... sort of thing.  A few years back I tried to apply a lot of the systems talked about in the book and it sort of worked for a while but fell apart like everything always does.  It might again this time but I'm really going to give it a concerted effort.  I really need to get a handle on my life and I'm confident that this system can be made to work for me.  ""Made to work for me"" is the operative point.  From what I can recall there are quite a few little nuances in the application of GTD that are just not feasible, particularly for my situation.  And the author (hallowed be his name ;) Join us, Brady!) says that you should take the bits that work for you and don't worry about the rest.  If I had any sort of influence (I most certainly do not) I would ask Brady to give the homework another try.  He doesn't have to do any of the things in the book.  Just get through it and tell us what he thinks.  That being said, I'm very satisfied with his effort thus far and understand completely that he will most likely never touch this vile, unholy, brainwashing text ever again.  Edit: I am a 32 y/o returning student studying Digital Audio Engineering. I'm a musician. I'm single and out of shape. I'm at what you might call a turning point in my life."

I started reading the book with high, but nonspecific expectations. After several hours I kept thinking to myself ""CGP Grey recommended this, I'm sure the pace will pick up at some point"". I thought the book would apply to me perfectly because I always have 10+ projects running at a time and few of them get finished because I lose interest after not dealing with it for some time.  When Brady unleashed his rant on the book, I was crying with laughter and relief. He'd experienced exactly the same thing I did. Even the language he used to describe it was very close to my thoughts.  The ""cultish"" nature of the book, the otherworldly examples ($6m inheritance)... I wasn't even sure where to start reading - the first 16 pages are acknowledgements, forewords and introductions. It even came with a bookmark that is printed with an advertisement to sign up for ""revolutionary GTD Mastering Workflow series"" seminar.  Something else: for all the time I spent reading, I could have listened to your summary or this one. The book just spends pages to explain a sentence. I don't think I've come across any jargon I didn't understand, but it is full of needless language regardless.  Before I got the book, I found this video of David Allen. At 3:45 he says:   ...by distributed cognition as scientists now call that. I was just going through one of my seminars and she went ""David, you know what this is?!"" I said ""What is it?"" and she said ""Distributed Cognition"". I went ""You mean, write it down?"" she goes ""Well that's another way to say it"".   I thought that bit was charming, and it gave me an indication that he wanted to keep the whole thing simple and straightforward. But while he avoids scientific language (which I'm familiar with) he certainly doesn't shy away from corporate language (which I'm not familiar with).  Anyways, sorry for the long rant. I hope it helps with your understanding of demographics relating to this book."

I have listened to the old GTD book and seen a lot of YouTube videos about GTD. I have the new 2015 book in paper but have not read it yet. I use omnifocus for iPhone, iPad and Mac (pro versions). After using GTD I have a lot more spare time and gets a lot more done in less time. Just as grey said I really feel a lot more relaxed in some kind of way. I think it is because I always know what needs to be done and what I can do and may be able to defer if something unexpected comes up.

CGPGrey,395ydx,Bruntaz,8,Tue Jun 9 22:25:29 2015 UTC,"I read Getting Things Done for the first time about a year ago and it has helped me tremendously. I work in architecture (only 1.8% chance of being replaced!) and my job is essentially designing retail stores, creating construction documents / drawings, and coordinating with engineers / contractors / vendors.   I think GTD is definitely more effective for someone who is not self-employed and work in a corporation. For instance - Context lists helps me because there are stuff I can only do at the office or home. My job also involves visits to sites (i.e. construction sites) and there are limited things that can be done there.  The process of writing everything down, organizing them by project and actions is also essential for me because architectural projects can just be immensely complex are very costly when there are errors. Most people I work with have some sort of a rigorous organizational system. They are not always GTD systems. But they often at least involve documenting as many things as possible and them filing them appropriately after.  I also get an endless amount of emails so I basically run a form of Inbox 0. When I first started working - I never organized my email inbox. I was so stupid and boy did I pay for that.  I also have a small Youtube channel on the side and I definitely write down video or script ideas as soon as I think of them - then process after like Grey does. In my opinion - it helps with braincrack ;)  P.S. thanks for introducing me to Omnifocus :)"

I started a GTD workflow for myself upon the first time hearing about it from one of the first HI episodes.  I was okay-ish before, but for me (and I suspect those like me) this system is golden.  I am so much better with it than without.  The book is boring. I skimmed a lot after the first half or so, I felt it could have been about half as long as it was without losing a single shred of useful information.  The principal of the book was fantastic, and I can't imagine where I would(n't) be without having implemented my own GTD system."

I skipped through and read around for the actual applicable stuff for me and didn't really find anything of interest.  It was a shame though... I was looking forward to the idea of 'feeling like I should be doing what I am doing' as the book claims I will.

CGPGrey,395ydx,synopsysbane,6,Tue Jun 9 20:08:28 2015 UTC,"I'll be listening to this later this evening, but managed to find a copy of Getting Things Done at a lit fest this weekend and have been making my way through it, as I've known I need to do something about my productivity and stress-level for a while now.  So far, the ideas seem very useful, but my concerns with how well I'll be able to implement this are two-fold: Time to Implement and Centralization.  By Time to Implement, I mean, I guess, that Allen suggests two full days to set everything up, which works great when you've hired a productivity consultant to come in and overhaul your life, but which I've struggled to deal with as someone who's already got a number of projects; I can see that it'll benefit me in the long run, but I'm finding it a bit hard to work out how this system will work for me when everything is constantly in flux. In the mean time, I'm stuck in the rut of setting unrealistic limits and now getting down on myself for not having already developed this system, though I gather that's something that will work itself out once I get a chance to put some work into this.  As far as Centralization: a very central point seems to be the idea of having everything emptied out in a place, knowing that you'll review everything and being able to access the place when necessary. The problem is that some workplaces don't take kindly to cloud-based storage, so most things like Evernote and even Google Docs are inaccessible. As such, it feels like I've got too many inboxes and lists everywhere.  I like the idea of review. I like the general philosophy that seems to be behind GTD, it just seems like a bit of a bear when it comes to implementation."
CGPGrey,395ydx,eqt,7,Tue Jun 9 20:12:56 2015 UTC,"It sort of funny, I found myself totally agreeing with both Grey and Brady about Getting Things Done.   In particular, I really agree that the GTD method definitely seems to have some cult like qualities to it (relevant XKCD here), the corporate oriented language and examples are very noticeable. I found that I was able to sort of read around those sections and only pay attention to the helpful, practical advice, but it was clearly present and very irritating.   I actually started reading the book just a couple of weeks before they assigned it as homework, and took the time to start implementing most of the steps. I've found that there are some very useful pieces of advice, even if it can be boiled down to a few basic points, like writing things down, keep track of ""Next Actions"" , and regularly reviewing your system. The bulk of the book, though, was dedicated to explaining the importance of using the GTD system for everything, so the practical advice was comparitively limited.   I guess that, over all, I've found the book to be helpful, but it comes with a lot of (sometimes irritating) filler."
CGPGrey,395ydx,Sungolf,7,Tue Jun 9 21:31:21 2015 UTC,"Regarding GTD: there is about 3 pages worth of content and 250 pages of useless babble.  If a human sat down in front of you and spoke anything like that you would loath them to their very core.  It has good fundamental ideas, and would have made a wonderful pamphlet, but it is a god-awful, agonizing, terrible, very bad, no good book.  I would go so far as to say the book does a disservice to the core ideas, but of course built up the authors consulting/training/coaching/certification business which was really the point.  Make a LOT more money doing those things than being even a successful author.  Most of the core ideas in the book simply reinforced what I had already learned over the years -- don't trust your memory, systems over willpower, review loops, etc.   As requested about me: mid-30s, college dropout, software developer, years consulting, now 4x founder (1 fail, 1 sold, 2 ongoing), plus partner on various (5 right now) tiny ""just for fun"" companies that are really just software collaborations among friends and will probably never mature into real businesses... more an excuse to hang out."

CGPGrey,395ydx,Kamikai,7,Wed Jun 10 02:59:41 2015 UTC,"GTD Views: (Read the newer version)  OK, so as far as my platform in life goes, I'm a high school student in India. I'm obsessed about productivity and read every book I can about it. Kanban, Pomodoro, you name it, I've tried it.  Getting to the book, I have to say I enjoyed it. While I agree on the technical jargon part, I read a lot of books about technology and startups, and hence I'm kind of accustomed to it.  Also, I liked it because in a sense of the word it gave my thoughts about workflow, priority factors, values thinking a concrete foundation as well as made me aware of some of the little nudges I had to provide to how I currently work, which I do in a highly organised manner.  Now while I say that, I have to give in and say, this book is terrible to go through. It's slow, and it's boring but in the end it feeds my inner creature of productivity and that's what matters. And while it does not push me to totally adopt what the writer said, I will try and adapt a more suitable version of it in my life. I feed of physical things to push me to do stuff, and basically that is why I kind of liked it. I have a lot of mixed feelings which I find hard to say about this. It's hard to explain why I'm middle ground because it's not entirely obvious, even to me, why I LIKE IT, because I'm clear on why I don't.  There's really not much else to say. I find 'The Power Of Habit' better. It may not be in the exact same category this books is in, but it's much more easy to wade through and really targets the fundamental problem we face, habits.   I do feel that in a way, and I mean to ask you this too, do you feel that somehow doing all this and how your mind fundamentally works in over-thinking about stuff like how your phone's home screen should look for days or how you should go about doing this and that, really just defeat the purpose of living a stress free productive life because you, even if you doing it subconsciously, putting stress on your mind over such complicated life patterns? I ask this because I'm pretty much the same way, obsessing over where things are, organisation, structure and I can't really control it. I can't just start doing anything until I've made the perfect physical environment to do it in."

I was (still a little bit)  a professional procrastinator, i had to miss one final exam in college to realize that i had a real problem and i had to solve it quickly. The thing about the book for me is that a lot of it is useless for the type of things i do but it has showed me the basics of being organized. If i had to resume what i did after reading it i would say it was getting omnifocus, fantastical and drafts on my iPhone and  massively dumping everything that comes my way to those apps. I don't have to remember anything anymore and its been a while since i said ""ffs i have a test tomorrow"" and i still have a long way to go because the problem i have now is that i have to do something and i have it written down but don't ever get to do it.

I think the difficult part for me in implementing the system is the mediums Allen is suggesting that is needed. He mentions using various paper trays which seem alright but not exactly needed. I'd think there was would be a more digital, convenient way to use the systems he suggests. I've been fiddling with Evernote to see how that'd work.  I've had a kinda-in-place way I would attempt to get projects down, which only really involved my memory, a calendar app, and post it night to remind myself of the most urgent things that need to be done. Although it has worked in the past, I'm really starting to dislike it and I think I need to switch to something else. By far the most appealing part of this system is just getting everything off my mind and somewhere else. Even just breaking projects down into actionable items (although it just seems obvious that I need to do X or Y action in my head) seems to give a kind of confidence and preparedness in what I'm setting out to do.  I'm curious to know how other students are handling this system. I'm off a semester for the summer and so really I'm not having to worry about attempting to work on too many school related projects but rather just some stuff to work on in my free time."
CGPGrey,395ydx,Obtainer_of_Goods,4,Tue Jun 9 19:35:09 2015 UTC,"With regards to the ""supercomputer in the pocket meaning you can do anything anywhere"" being detrimental to the getting things done ethos. While that is true, and you can do most things on a large screen smartphone, it's fair to say that while you can do most things on it, it's not always the best tool for it.  You can write an essay on a phone, it's easily powerful enough to do it, however the typing won't be as good compared to a laptop or a tablet, and reviewing it won't be as good because you can't view as much at once. So surely it would make sense to limit the phone only doing the things that it does as well or better than the other devices?  For example, I have written a computer program on my smartphone before (I was out with friends and one of them challenged me to do something and it was the only device on me) - my phone is easily capable of doing it, but coding on a phone is very unproductive as getting to the special characters takes multiple taps, you can't see long lines of code etc, etc.. So I never feel the urge to start continuing working on a project because I know it would take far too long to achieve anything, and the quality of the output would be hindered as a result.  Now, I know this is similar to what Brady suggested to ""making Starbucks your location for doing X and the library for doing task Y"" - however if that is a problem and you still find yourself loading up Pages to write a script (or whatever task is demoted from the phone) then simply uninstall those apps.  Now, if you say ""well I have Internet data on my phone, I can reinstall those apps when I am in Starbucks"" - well then it's an issue of self control. A person on a diet leaving the gym and running to the cake shop is not the same as the person on a diet being locked in the ice cream freezer."

CGPGrey,395ydx,aaronite,5,Tue Jun 9 20:34:59 2015 UTC,"Here are my remarks on Getting Things Done and information on my place in life:  I am an engineering student who recently graduated from undergrad and has just started graduate school/research.  I've always been quite organized and have been using a desk calendar all throughout college to help me keep track of assignments, projects, group meetings, events, etc.  I already had a sticky note + note card system in place for handling more pressing things, including homework assignments and what David Allen would probably classify as ""next actions"" in GTD for longer projects.  I think Grey hit the nail on the head when summarizing the book in a few short sentences, regarding the brain not being a tool meant for remembering.  I don't think I'll be drastically changing my system because what I have now already works; however, I did not have a good system in place yet for longer term projects with not so clearly defined edges.  GTD helped me to realize I should be recording all of the small and big ideas and to not be afraid of wasting notebook paper to organize my thoughts.  As it would turn out, notebook paper is quite cheap, and organizing all of your ideas for a long term goal by writing them down is remarkably helpful in realizing what steps will need to be taken to realize your dreams.  On the negative side though, it is a really boring read.  I found myself getting frustrated, like he was beating around the bush most of the time.  I just wanted a concise summary of what the problem was (stressing over memory), why it's a huge problem, and actionable steps that can be taken and systems that can be implemented to solve the problem.  I feel like this message can be conveyed in far fewer words/pages than done in the book.  So far, I've only read through chapter 5, and I'm somewhat doubtful I'll be finishing the book.  Especially after listening to the podcast, I'm skeptical that what I would gain from the remainder of the book would outweigh the time and attention investment.  I've been a fan of the podcast since its debut and of CGPGrey's YouTube channel as well as Brady's fleet of them for years.  Please keep up the excellent content!"

This helps me actually do things instead of being daunted by a huge project.  I am still struggling with doing the weekly review on time though."

CGPGrey,395ydx,Wolfgang52,4,Wed Jun 10 00:06:39 2015 UTC,"Ok Grey, since you asked:  I am a Canadian college student, I am technically in my 2nd/3rd year (don't know which since I am currently taking summer courses). I am out of shape, no job (my parents pay for everything) and I am going through a lot of personal change. Currently I am trying to A) bring standards into a proper context (see paragraph below) and B) not be lazy, anxious, forgetful and stressed all at the same time. I'm hoping some stuff from GTD will help with that. I am grateful I am not the only one who thought the book was boring (FYI I didn't read it all yet) and hard to read. I felt like I was supposed to be finding what he said fascinating and easy to read. Also totally agree with the whole ""context"" thing, there is so little I cannot do when in other places.  Throughout my life (not intending to humblebrag here) I usually got slightly above average grades in school. But I had to work quite hard to get those, if I just put in the work that was average for me, I would probably get below average grades. It's kind of been an insult for me to the grades I did because I was yes better than the average, but not good enough to meet other people standards. Other people being my parents, other asians (I am asian), university and my own."

Cut it down to actual advice and it would be far better.    I don't want to be told how my life is going to better.  Just give me the advice.  Succinctly."
CGPGrey,395ydx,JeffDujon,5,Wed Jun 10 02:40:29 2015 UTC,"So, about filling a car with helium balloons when going to the dump, here is the pointless calculation: Air at sea level weigh in about 1.2 Kg/m3 (Atmosphere of Earth Wiki: Density and mass) The interior volume of say a large station wagon can be about 5 m3 (Vehicle size class) Garbage dump rates seem to range about $130/ton, so already we are upper bound by 5(m3) * 1.2(Kg/m3) * 0.13($/Kg) = 0.78($), and this is the very best case where we don't even carry any helium in place of the air but actually have a vacuum in the car. The helium it self changes little weighing in at 0.17 Kg/m3 (Helium) bringing us down to $0.67. But the balloons (and now I'm just approximating wildly): say a balloon weighs 5g, and holds a volume of 0.01 m3 (a sphere of 20 cm radius). This gives us 0.5 Kg/m3, living us a gain of 0.53 Kg/m3 for helium balloon over air, worth $0.34 for the whole car. And sphere packing will bring us down to $0.25."

As much as I appreciate Grey's video quality, the lack of volume makes me think that he really isn't as productive as his talk of work flow and checklists are supposed to make him.  I work at a nuclear plant.  In an attempt to improve maintenance productivity they added about 50 extra people and 3 layers to the work planning process.  In order to meet targets, the assessed time for each job seems to have been extended significantly.  Now we have twice as many people getting half the work done, but we fill in the check boxes that say we are getting our planned maintenance done, so all is good..."

The orange symbolizes Brady -- orange is the colour that my brain has always assigned to Brady for some reason. Maybe because he's ginger red haired? Or maybe because his dogs have a brown/orange coat? Or perhaps because Dovsky animates him with a similar colour fur armour? anyway... The Owl in the centre is a neutral H.I. symbol, as opposed to e.g. the beaker and cogwheel. I didn't think mixing and matching Grey's symbol with something representing Brady would be a correct approach. The duality / symmetry of the Owl represents the complementarity of Grey and Brady's personalities. The white symbolizes their friendship.   The other two flags are based on the same design:  Second is the H.I. Flag of War (in case Cortex gets any ideas.. might get handy.)  Third is an homage to Plane Crash Corner (which we all love because we love Brady) -- it's the Flag of Hello Internet Airlines."

And finally with either a yellow/blue background, I guess, the bright future of education ahead of them or the sky's the limit (not literally of course, they can (or just Brady, if CGPGrey demands comfortable rides) can head to space too someday)?  I haven't scanned through most of the designs so I'm not sure if anyone has made anything too similar. But anyways, I'd love to hear your comments. Thanks!"

Characters on flags, as we all know, are taboo, yet ""H"" and ""I"" comprise the primary symbology of the podcast. Here they are present when looked for, but not conspicuously so. The letters are pixelated representations, representing the digital videos for which both Brady and Grey are known. The flag is symmetric with contrasting colors, much in the way that Brady and Grey balance and complement one another. The perimeter is made of four black/white squares (Brady) and four gray squares (Grey). Obviously there is an extra gray square in the center for...uh...idk because that's what the HI logo is? Or Grey does the editing? :P"

I mean if you think about it the switching cost of moving to another country must be huge right?  So what  was so compelling that Grey had to move to England? It's particularly interesting to me because I live in Belgium and I would maybe like to move to another country, maybe the USA but it seems to me that Grey must have some really good reasons to not do that."
CGPGrey,38dlmw,orangeflameyphoenix,58,Wed Jun 3 19:01:03 2015 UTC,He actually has a dark history as the leader of a biker gang.  He had to change his name and appearance and flee the country after a number of run-ins with rival gangs and the law.

CGPGrey,38dlmw,bigbrotherinlaw,16,Wed Jun 3 19:35:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like you must have considered it before, but I really want to know why you don’t jailbreak your iphone. It would fix many complaints you have with ios!  It allows you to have f.lux on ios, system wide dark mode, have blank icons, and, as you mentioned today, hide the text beneath icons.  I know you must have a good reason not to jailbreak, but please reveal it! I tweeted this at you guys too because I so desperately want to know."

CGPGrey,38dlmw,yoyojedi,4,Wed Jun 3 19:01:09 2015 UTC,"I've Always wondered how do people that use a DVORAK or similar layouts deal with Keyboard shortcuts. As someone that does some coding (but mainly quote a bit of LaTeX editing) i need shortcuts constantly to do anything in my computer, to the Point that most of the time I disable my mouse entirely and just rely in muscle memory and the keyboard.   Now, I'd guess that Grey has to do something similar when using applications like Logic or editing a video, how do you manage to use shortcuts,if at all?"

CGPGrey,38dlmw,flt001,29,Wed Jun 3 15:09:54 2015 UTC,Won't the scope of this podcast mean it won't go for very long? I mean surely there is only so much notoriously under sharing grey will have to say about how he remains productive each week. I suppose it will probably end up eventually transforming into a productivity podcast rather than a let's quiz grey podcast

I feel like it's too early to judge this podcast as it has to settle down to a more stable format, but it's good so far.  I am curious to know what the dynamic of the discussion will be like in the future – if it will be a back-and-forth as in HI, or if it will be just Grey answering Myke's (and listeners') questions. I guess only time will tell."
CGPGrey,38dlmw,Tsukamori,35,Wed Jun 3 17:03:15 2015 UTC,Podcasts are always a bit weird at the start.  Go back and listen to the first three episodes of H.I. and they're nothing like the current episodes.

I currently use Inbox, Keep and Pomotodo and they are sufficient but not as polished."
CGPGrey,38dlmw,tfofurn,14,Wed Jun 3 17:09:54 2015 UTC,"It is one of the things that is a slight frustration I have about Hello Internet, and will likely have about this.  As a Windows/Android user, while I'm certainly not treating this as a ""religious war"" as Grey put it, that almost all of the apps in question are iOS exclusive does make it difficult to take advantage of the in-depth, detailed, discussion of apps, etc. Something I am otherwise incredibly interested in.  The specific details of workflow and such are the part of these podcasts I find the most interesting. And the more detail the more interesting it is. And yet, the more detail, the less use the information is to me. :("
CGPGrey,38dlmw,ToraNeko82,8,Wed Jun 3 23:39:17 2015 UTC,Its really frustrating that there's no way to get a taste of something like omnifocus without changing my entire work environment

CGPGrey,38dlmw,imyke,25,Wed Jun 3 17:43:01 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, this could not be a better podcast for me!  I am drowning horribly with task management (I missed two required trainings at work this year, so I'm in big do-do) and I have been required by my boss to find a system and stick to it and work for it.  (Honestly, I work in a pretty cool place and I'm so thankful they're giving me some time to work this out).  And my biggest problem is dealing with the larger nebulous projects, which I know Grey does!  So while I'm googling about the internet, there's not a lot of really big discussions of task/project management systems that aren't for business-y type people.  (I'm an engineer, so I'm kinda business-y, but not totally)  I'll really be looking forward to all of these!"

Why CGP doesn't have the phone app?  I can feel that it must have been answered in depth already... In that case just enlighten me with the link.  Thanks.
CGPGrey,38dlmw,NathanGath,5,Wed Jun 3 20:22:50 2015 UTC,"I remember Grey saying in an old HI that he never listens to voicemail; everybody who has his number knows that he prefers texts.  Correspondingly, I wouldn't expect him to be the originator of many phone calls.  He can search for contacts (or the phone app) if he really needs to make a voice call."

CGPGrey,38dlmw,Drackodelmal,18,Wed Jun 3 17:35:02 2015 UTC,I would listen the shit out of that.
CGPGrey,38dlmw,malak1000,37,Wed Jun 3 19:40:39 2015 UTC,So would I.  Brady (obviously) gets more work done than I do.
CGPGrey,38dlmw,Wolfgang52,13,Wed Jun 3 20:32:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I don't think it would be useful to listen.  I got the idea Brady just works a lot because he feels like working a lot.  I don't think you can emulate that at all. That's why some people really need systems to be productive.

CGPGrey,38dlmw,Boingboingsplat,8,Thu Jun 4 11:15:50 2015 UTC,Another two-dudes-talking podcast to add to my list!
CGPGrey,38dlmw,IThinkThings,7,Wed Jun 3 16:07:01 2015 UTC,ep 3 will be the mother of all follow-ups and I'm going to enjoy it!!
CGPGrey,38dlmw,bigbrotherinlaw,8,Wed Jun 3 17:02:44 2015 UTC,"After listening to the first episode, I was slightly underwhelmed. But then I realised that I pressed the play button with a dangerous bias. I was expecting this podcast to be like the two-dudes-talking Hello Internet one, which I gather it isn't. So, I thought it was only fair, and also since tomorrow is a holiday, and I was making an elaborate dinner, that I listened to the episode once again. And … it got better.  Of course, since I don’t know Myke as well as I know Grey and Brady (YouTube), I am not yet that comfortable. Which is surprising since Myke seems to be this normal guy, in the middle of the extremities defined by Brady and Grey. He is structured enough to keep the interview engaging, but still an interview. I can give it another chance. More than one probably.  Now, do I have any idea about creating podcasts? No. So of course I have suggestions.   Don’t:     delay the Grey Checklists. That is the primary reason I am here. Details of items are welcome, but workflows are more important.  be Hello Internet, in the sense of debating over general things (which I like very much, but would be very confusing here). Do prod into the Grey-brain-Cells, asking questions to which Grey’s answers start with “a long time ago”, “when I was in college”, “when the first reptiles came out of water” (which I love, since they help with context), but relevant to productivity, and not so much society, or YouTube. (Complaining about Apple is allowed)  cannibalize on Hello Internet. I still want to hear Brady’s (witty) reactions and (very interesting) comments countering Grey-ology, on all topics, including productivity. (Guest appearance by Brady?)   AppCrashCorner Section where you complain about / compliment some app (or it’s feature) that you use. Not reviews, but more like paper cuts. Like that conversation about Due pinging you per minute, etc. Since I do some iOS development on the side (lab course), I am very interested in understanding the usability features preferred / loathed upon by productivity oriented or power users.  This was the first episode, so forgive me if I was too quick to stupid."

CGPGrey,38dlmw,dustinechos,5,Wed Jun 3 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that being productive is especially relevant to the lazier people (who actually also intend to do stuff). Self motivated productive people may not find it very useful.   I have come way past the point where I could shame myself into doing the real and/or important stuff. I have come to the conclusion that I am, characteristically, lazy.   However being lazy means if I want to get stuff done, I need to make the best use of the limited amount of the 'productive' time of my day (I do get bored of being lazy sometimes). Hence I actively use and search for the things that can help me organize real and/or important tasks densely into that limited time. My entire day is basically lethargy dotted by bursts of activities.  Furthermore, since the world does not follow my preferred clock, I have to calibrate my productive times to match that of the real world (I really prefer working when everyone else is sleeping, and vice versa). For that, I need to create habits. I keep stuff like sleep, morning routine, get ready, lunch break, YouTube / Podcast, dinner, etc in my calendar just to have constant visual reminders (homescreen widgets, Android). (I know that there are a lot of specific apps for developing habits, but didn't I say I was lazy?)   One thing that I haven't tried so far is the explicit timing of tasks. So far my deadlines are always set externally, but I have not yet ventured into self imposed / tracked deadlines. Possible room for further optimization I guess."
CGPGrey,38dlmw,sdolidze,4,Wed Jun 3 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"I've had 'sleep' as a repeating event on my calendar for a while.

CGPGrey,377vnz,demultiplexer,46,Mon May 25 17:23:19 2015 UTC,"There was a grain of truth in the myth though. Practically, all regular urine peed out is not sterile, but urine right out of the (healthy) kidney is sterile, as bacteria can't pass the filtering membrane in the glomerulus. The urine gets contaminated further up the urinary tract, usually already in the ureters and the bladder, but a lot more in the urethra.  Besides, even if urine was sterile, for all emergency and clinical applications clean tapwater or bottled water is the better choice if sterilized water isn't available. EDIT: typos"
CGPGrey,377vnz,juniegrrl,4,Mon May 25 23:57:00 2015 UTC,"No, this is the entire issue. The reason urine is thought to be sterile, is because it doesn't produce growth on agar (or on other common growth media). This doesn't mean it's sterile, it just doesn't contain the bacteria and archaea that grow on agar (and... etc.). Actually, it's been recently found that there's at least two dozen species of bacteria and archaea that commonly exist in the kidneys and probably a couple hundred species that we can't isolate yet. It is far from sterile.  This doesn't mean anything qualitatively; it's functionally sterile enough not to cause problems when drank or injected into the bloodstream. There is no toxicity associated with the bacteria and archaea in urine, at least as far as we know. If anything, the urea and waste products are orders of magnitude more of a concern, both when passing through your urethra and in the case of ingestion, absorption or otherwise reintroduction."

I'd just like to point out that Brady and Grey's discussion centred briefly on the lack of green in the proposed flag, which I will now take advantage of to shamelessly plug my April 2012 runner-up flags, of which both incorporate green. They got second and third, respectively, if I recall correctly, but the post-win voting has moved them around somewhat, and I'm somewhat upset that my second design (which I -even then- was starting to hate a little bit) has moved above the first.  PS  I have this really strange thing where I almost always, out of the blue, think to check for a new HI and I'm always shocked and surprised to find that there is one, and then I come here afterward to look at the discussion only to find that it came out just hours before. It's happened at least four times now, and no it's not just that I constantly check for the site new uploads (I check at most once a week).  I have a theory that I keep seeing HI-tangential things on my front page and not notice them, but my brain subconsciously fixates on the idea of HI. But that doesn't make a huge amount of sense because I was going to do some flag designing and was looking for something to listen to, and I had 99% Invisible open in the other tab when I though to come here."

CGPGrey,377vnz,whonut,17,Mon May 25 16:53:44 2015 UTC,"Hey guys. I'm a watchmaker and I can give some reasoning to why an anolog display has some benefit over digital.    first: you can read more quickly the time on an anolog display over a digital one, as you need only focus on the angle the hands make. This also is a good feature to have when, say, the watch is sitting on a desk away from your wrist on a nightstand. If it was digital, you would necessarily need to read the digits to tell the time. This brings me to my second point: second: in certain professions, having an anolog watch is required. My sister is a nurse and my cousin is an emergency medical technician: both are required to have anolog wristwatches. The reasoning is that they often need to measure heart rates, or count out heart compressions or whatever; having an anolog watch is easier because you can visualise 1 turn of a hand on a watch face easier when your counting. If you use a digital display, suddenly the seconds/minutes your counting directly competes with the compressions/breaths/heartrate/etc.    Finally, while I am no surgeon: I always listen to watchmakers Brady and Grey when I'm ""operating"" on my clients watches. :P"

Also, people have made very nerdy watch faces, like the Nintendo64; 007: golden eye watch. And a pipboy from fallout.  Edit After listening more to the podcast.

I just think it looks strange to have a new technology mimicking an old one... Perhaps this is exacerbated by the face the Apple Watch is square, but that is a diversion.  What do you think of this? http://dornob.com/digital-hourglass-watch-tells-time-past-in-sand-pixels/"
CGPGrey,377vnz,Tao_McCawley,9,Mon May 25 18:19:26 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about icons mimicking old objects? I mean look at your phone right now. The icon for the camera app is a picture of an old analogue camera. The Instagram icon is the same. The clock icon is an old analogue clock, the email app is an old letter, the podcasts one is a radio broadcast tower, settings looks like old cogs, etc. I could go on.   There is an interesting design philosophy, adopted by apple in particular, where they deliberately style updated versions of old things after the old thing itself. There is no reason for ""email"" to look like an old paper letter, but something about it is understated and classy.  I think they went for a similar approach with the apple watch. Something about the circular clock face as opposed to a digital watch is sort of hipster and stylish. Not saying I agree with it, but I think it's helpful to try and understand where apple are coming from on this."

The flag debate is obscuring discussion on other domestic issues of importance (the TPPA, austerity measures, housing issues etc.). It's as Brady said in the podcast that the ""consultation"" process is pretty farcical. Polling is showing public sentiment is with not changing the flag.  That said, I'm in favour of changing. NOT to the silver fern, though.  indigenous Maori population of New Zealand needs formal representation. The silver fern is a sporting symbol. As a nation, we are more than a sport.   This is the Tino Rangatiratanga flag. Any thoughts on this direction? http://imgur.com/wEaqkzn"

The government can do more than one thing at once. Suggesting it cannot is silly. Suggesting the flag is being used to hide 'problems' is a terrible conspiracy and a criticism of the public more than the government. Finally to complain about the $25 million dollar cost while the government spends billions a week is also silly. The flag needed to be done, because it was never going away and it's an annoying topic that needs to be voted on so we don't have to hear about it every year."

You may happen upon a mind blowing idea, but until you can properly convey what it is and why it's awesome (not all great ideas can instantly be summed up in a catchy phrase), other people are generally going to approach it with skepticism. Their reaction also depends on their personality and your relationship with them. It's far too easy to think of something great, attempt to communicate it to your fellow human, and then get a very bored and consequently, demotivating, response.  If necessary, it's often better to bounce an idea off of a generally curious person if you absolutely need to talk to someone about it. They're more likely to try to understand your idea.

Maybe its not the best for the animated things, but the swearing actually to me, makes the podcast seem more like ""Two dudes talking"" because actively censoring a conversation leads to a weird flow of conversation. Where there are stops and starts because you had to rethink an entire sentence to censor it.  Mind you I don't want to turn the whole podcast into a swearfest. But the occasional ones make the podcast feel more genuine to me."

And when Grey is Jet lagged and is unsure of whether or not his teeth are real. The flowers are from Ep. #35 at around 5:27, the teeth realism is Ep. 35 starting around 1:23:30, and the wolf face is from Ep. #36 @ around 27:35."

The timing is off which makes it a little cringe-y. The animation looks worse, well, it's not the most important part in this series, but I think there is a threshold on how bad the animation can be and, although it doesn't matter how over you get, this video hasn't reach the lowest requirement. I mean what the hell is up with the first part? The figures are too thin and bent. Has brady's nose always been like that?  There are still many good stuff about it (the coffestain, the cool aid guy etc). I am sorry if I am not being constructive, of course I love the animated series, my favorite one is #4."
CGPGrey,34yfqs,GreenThunderDovsky,9,Tue May 5 17:24:30 2015 UTC,"No worries, criticism is always appreciated. Not gonna lie, I skipped a heartbeat there for a second when I started reading the comment (as is only natural) but I see your points and I was glad to have read them. Addressing your points, time sometimes is off because flash as a program works weird when synchronizing sound with the actual time and frames of the video, still figuring out every nuance, but there is some stuff I can't work around. Brady's nose; I mean I don't know I just draw stuff however it feels easier...  . Can you explain me what you meant with too thin and bent?"
CGPGrey,34yfqs,SwordsOfVaul,8,Tue May 5 18:25:18 2015 UTC,"The nose: I dont know why but i find this and this far more appealing than this and this and this. My theory is that it may have something to do with the details that add personality to Brady's face. When it is more blank you can project the personality that makes you feel more comfortable with.  The timing: I was not talking about desync. I was mainly talking about the pauses before the transition animations. Especially at 0:42. I would think that cutting that pause to the minimum will greatly improve the comedic effect. Also there seem to be transitions from clips that are way too close and related to each other.  Thin and Bent: Well I may have talked too fast on that one. Upon more looking into, most of my complain comes from Grey's new body. img and img and img compared to img and img and img"

Then below that are boroughs (our version of counties), but huge swaths of the state aren't in a borough, then there's organizied cities/towns/villages , some in boroughs, some not. And THEN there's places where the borough and city are one and the same, like Anchorage and some of the cities down the panhandle. This leads to 3 Alaska cities being among the top 5 largest American cities by area.  Mix in the land ownership by Native corps, which is different then the reservation system used in the rest of the country (except for the one Res in the SE tip of the state) and you have a regular mess just like UK/Britain/England!"

I obviously can't speak for all women but in my experience, it's usually very obvious which men are there to shop with or for their partners and which ones are there specifically to be creepy. People who go to ladies' underwear places for creepy purposes are generally very blatant about it. What I'm saying is, I wouldn't worry about being a normal bloke doing normal bloke things in the bra section as we (well, I can only talk about myself here, really) wouldn't be intimidated by you being there at all.  I wouldn't feel at all uncomfortable or creeped out by a guy making friendly eye contact (there's a big difference between that and leering) with me while I'm shopping for an ""over the shoulder boulder holder"" or seeing a guy handling the bras or texing.  What is creepy - and these are all true stories from times I've gone underwear shopping - is seeing guys fondling the bras and knickers with one hand while fiddling in their trouser pocket with the other, shoving the phone under the gap in the changing room door or shuffling up to me to tell me that the underwear I'm holding  would look ""sexy"" on me.  Long story short: we see you, we know you're not there to perv and that you'd probably rather not be there so please don't be embarrassed. And just to reiterate what Grey was saying about Mrs.Grey's experiences, if you're a guy in the bra section PLEASE stop looking at your shoes so that we can give you the signal to move aside if you're in our way!"

I'll skip most of it, particularly the optional stuff.  If you're enlisted (IE, not an officer), every time you encounter an officer outdoors (with certain exceptions mostly due to safety), you must salute the officer and greet them verbally.  This is really bad when you're doing shift work and going home in the opposite directly.  Good morning, ma'am. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir.  And on and on and on.

CGPGrey,3472r8,ShadowKing94,25,Tue Apr 28 22:23:48 2015 UTC,"If you go all-in on OmniFocus today, the cost isn't cheap.  (Though you can get in the door with their $20 iPhone version)  The money-worth-it question is hard to answer without knowing the particulars of your situation.  Don't tell the OmniGroup, but they could raise the cost of OmniFocus to a $1,000 a year subscription and, I would hesitate, but my time ROI spreadsheet says it would be worth it and I'd happily pay.  And that's because the app saves me lots of time and, even more importantly, thinking effort.    But it totally depends on the kind of person you are.  For Brady, (hopeless, hopeless, Brady) I suggested my other go-to app which is Clear.  Clear isn't one tenth as powerful as OmniFocus but that's it's selling point: dead simple lists.  That's all some people need, and I use clear, but I couldn't run my whole life from it the way I do with OmniFocus.    So it depends a lot on what kind of person you are.  If your life is desperately, desperately chaotic your best investment is probably the Getting Things Done book and a clipboard with paper.  That's how I turned my life around -- I needed to use paper to learn how I wanted to use lists in the first place and I ran the first four years of my teaching career with paper and a few printable templates.  If paper can work for a teacher's life it can totally work for a student.    TL;DR: OmniFocus is the best at everything and you pay for it, Clear is the simplest and cheapest and that might be what you need, GTD and paper might be the place to start to figure out what will work best for you."

CGPGrey,32h0px,Santurechia,8,Tue Apr 14 09:59:01 2015 UTC,"I get what he's saying.  The problem is that it has two meanings for the way a ball is propelled out of one's hand in a manner in which it strikes the ground before it reaches its intended target.  They are simply too close to each other yet wildly different.  Wouldn't it be mighty strange if we learned that in some tiny English speaking town in the middle of nowhere they happened to refer to skipping as ""jogging""?  That would be confusing.  And the first thing that would go through all of our heads would be ""That's not jogging! That's skipping!""  Seems like a reasonable response to me.  It just means we're going to need a lot more episodes of Cricket Corner.  (I actually really want this.)"
CGPGrey,32h0px,Kniles,6,Wed Apr 15 04:45:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's the case for two reasons:   Grey wants to use the word throw at first, however Brady points out that the word throw cannot be used because it means something different in the same sport. Then Grey suggests the word bounce. Then we have another problem. In basketball when a player bounces the ball, that player is not doing something nearly as close as what a cricket player is doing when he/she bowls the ball. Therefore if bowl isn't the right word, bounce isn't a good one either, by the same logic. Second, it's like what Grey said about Autos and the German language. Think about every sport somewhat as a different language. Obviously every sport will have technical terms for things that happen only within that sport while using words that otherwise don't mean the same thing. Also, shooting in basketball and football have to completely different meanings; tackling in football and American football have completely different meanings as well. Yet, it is just like Grey said before, nobody is going to be confused because context tells you what you need to know."

CGPGrey,32h0px,PanzerPelle,11,Mon Apr 13 20:55:41 2015 UTC,"Hey Grey - in relation to the OP and your airport signage anger, lack of signage for security is just as frustrating for airports as it is for the passengers.  In the US, TSA takes terminal space for security (doesn't pay rent for said space) and doesn't have to follow any airport rules or guidelines, trumping any request with Homeland Security.  We (airport planners and airports) have wanted to create a consistent signage for years.  Actually, the most requested type of notice is overhead monitors showing videos, as they are a better attention grabber because Americans will do anything to stare at a TV.  That being said, the videos shown near security today (at few airports) are terrible TSA videos.  But, because of the lack communication between Homeland Security and the FAA, it's hard enough to be consistent with TSA employees themselves, much less relaying the correct information to the passenger.    But please don't think the airport wouldn't incorporate better signage, as they are all salivating at doing so.  Blame the appropriate party, TSA (or in the UK the Department of Transport)."

When you bowl(the cricket definition), your arm must swing around and you must release the ball WITHOUT BENDING YOUR ELBOW.  When you throw, you move both elbow and shoulder joints.  I think the bowler isn't allowed to throw at the batsman because it's considered too much of an advantage(I don't know why)."

CGPGrey,32h0px,datodi,8,Thu Apr 16 13:42:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, medal count should be per capita to control for population. However, we need to be controlling for other factors! Sports excellence are also a function of country wealth (e.g. GDP), measures of investment and spending in sports (investment in sports infrastructure as a share of all private and public investment, share of consumer expenditures in sports), some measure of the quality of their sports infrastructure, for each sport, whether there is a local league in the country that functions year round, and so on and so forth. There is obviously a path-dependence issue here as well, which Brady would call culture (for instance, if Australians are all really into cricket and they win all the titles so all Australians love cricket and want to play and win the titles for the home country).  India has a lot of people, more so than Australia, but real GDP per capita is an eighth that of Australia. Cricket Australia apparently made 684 million USD over its latest four year cycle. India would need to make over 34 billion in revenue to match that per capita. Of course, there is the flip side in say, football (soccer) that Brazil has won the most of the world cups, and Latin America, in spite of poor economic performance and lesser infrastructure compared to Europe or the US, does really well. Brazil and Argentina are really big, but I would say that culture matters a lot here. Also, for club performances (not just national competitions) Europe takes the lead again.

CGPGrey,324law,NathanGath,52,Fri Apr 10 16:06:23 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely the key concept that creators will need to grasp.   Before this system takes effect, every additional view on youtube increases the money for YouTubers (because the advertisers are paying for each view).   After this system takes effect, every additional view on youtube SPLITS the money for YouTubers (because the viewers are paying a fixed amount).  Whatever this ends up costing per user will certainly be higher than whatever YouTube could expect to earn off of the average user in advertising dollars, which means more money IN the pie, but now the pie is finite and creators will have to fight each other for a slice."

From a business point of view YouTube wouldn't be offering a way around advertising if it was likely to decrease their revenue overall.

Although I'm sure there will be certain niche exceptions, and the deal is obviously better for large channels than it is for small ones."

CGPGrey,324law,Bol_of_physics,2,Fri Apr 10 21:23:25 2015 UTC,"I think a useful thought experiment is “what system would YouTube need to allocate pay-subscriber money just to ‘make-whole’ creators from the lost Ad revenue?”  Well, certainly creators that get more payer views should get more payer money because they are losing more ad revenue. And if you have less payer views, doesn’t it make sense that you get less payer money?  (I’m always assuming ad revenue = function of views).   Then, it makes PERFECT SENSE for YouTube to allocate payer money based on the aggregate views of all the pay subscribers (which also means the payers that view more should have a bigger say in where the pay money goes – because they would have created more ad revenue).   So, this argument that CGP Grey is getting a raw deal in the new payer world because he doesn’t post often is incorrect – if he has 5% of payer views, he should get 5% of the money in the pot, because he lost a commensurate amount of Ad views.    Keep in mind that today CGP Grey gets paid per month on how often he is viewed. Creators that upload daily may get more views per month, and then more money, but that’s the world we live in today and we're OK with it.  BUT the cooperation vs. competition with other channels would still become a problem :(  And, if YouTube were to bundle channels, and apportion more or less payer money to bundles than the % of views they get (say, giving 15% of  the payer money to “Educational videos”  even though they had 10% of views), then that’s a whole other set of problems…"

Most people can digest a five minute video in its entirety, so grey would be paid for the five minutes of watched time. However, the longer the video is, the shorter our attention span gets. Maybe some people watch the whole thing, but if enough people only watch a few minutes and give up, the revenue earned vs work put in becomes a larger gap.

CGPGrey,324law,Bol_of_physics,14,Sat Apr 11 08:42:13 2015 UTC,"My company films yoga, cooking and fitness experts and puts those videos up under subscription. We pay these experts in a similar way to the above statement. Given the numbers above, this is how we'd calculate: say a user pays $10/mo, that puts $5.50 of that money up for being given to experts. We then look at what videos that user watched in the month, and give the experts of those videos a percentage of that $5.50 based on the watch time. So if the user watched 10 minutes from Expert A, 5 minutes from Expert B and 5 minutes from Expert C: A would get $2.75, B and C would get $1.375 each. If the user only watched free content or no content, we'd keep all the money.  Watch time would seem to favor longer videos, and views would favor shorter. But really, what's favored is singular users. Users that only watch videos from one Expert. If in the above, the user only watched the 5 minutes of Expert C, then Expert C gets all of the $5.50."

CGPGrey,324law,snakeinthegarden14,2,Fri Apr 10 16:02:17 2015 UTC,This seems like an odd decision on youtube's part. What they have essentially done is incentivise creators to target the people who consume the least amount of content on youtube. Creators will be going after the people who watch very little on youtube as long as its one of their videos.  This would be good for those creators but youtube will get less views overall as a result.
CGPGrey,324law,HobbitFoot,2,Sat Apr 11 04:26:10 2015 UTC,"But this breaks down if more than one user signs up for paid subscription. All views from payers go into one big pot (is how I read the contract), so if there are 2 paid subscribers (Al and Bob) and Al logs in once for Expert C, and Bob logs in 1,000 times for Experts A, B, and C, then the total money will be divided pretty much equally among experts. Or you can think about when Al doesn't log in at all... his money goes to what Bob watches."

Edit: To ad on to this: would they fix the system that makes it so you only see channels that you're subscribed to that you frequent (I can't remember if they resolved it or not, but people weren't seeing videos posted)?

CGPGrey,324law,SHD_lotion,31,Fri Apr 10 16:19:09 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons I like youtube is the free content. I cannot afford and don't see myself paying for youtube anytime soon.  If the videos end up behind a paywall where I simply cannot see it without some sort of subscription, I would be very sad to miss out on my cgpgrey fix. Hopefully the CGPgrey email list and reddit would keep me up to date of new content if this becomes the case. By the way I do not use adblocker if you wanted to know."
CGPGrey,324law,McElhaney,11,Fri Apr 10 15:21:53 2015 UTC,RSS + iTunes.
CGPGrey,324law,lithedreamer,2,Fri Apr 10 16:36:13 2015 UTC,I'll imagining this as basically paid AdBlock. It doesn't look like content will be actually hidden.
CGPGrey,324law,McElhaney,4,Fri Apr 10 19:12:25 2015 UTC,"There is an option to make ""paid-only"" videos."
CGPGrey,324law,Trendane,3,Fri Apr 10 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"Which isn't a problem because if people want to do that, they're the ones that miss out on the views"
CGPGrey,324law,McElhaney,10,Sat Apr 11 03:33:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good idea, but the problem is that a lot of people who watch YouTube regularly enough to consider buying it are people who are in school, and most likely don't have the money to spend on it. But I still think it is a good idea for them, as there are teachers and other professions that might buy it and use it."
CGPGrey,324law,TheSlimyDog,3,Fri Apr 10 15:14:33 2015 UTC,"I believe that the purpose of it is not to replace the ads for the vast majority of people. It's hopefully just being presented as another option, which is great."
CGPGrey,324law,slobod,22,Fri Apr 10 15:27:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like ad companies/youtube will find a way to exploit it and make more money.   Also, how are they going to stop people from just using Ad-block? Because I'm interested, but also poor and could use that money somewhere else."
CGPGrey,324law,TheNumerOne,20,Fri Apr 10 15:13:25 2015 UTC,They can't.  Just like HBO can't stop you from torrenting Game of Thrones. But they still offer a paid service and make money off it.
CGPGrey,324law,Adderkleet,13,Fri Apr 10 15:21:15 2015 UTC,"But they can stop you from torrenting Game of Thrones, because that's illegal and Ad-block isn't."
CGPGrey,324law,scorinth,31,Fri Apr 10 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"""stop you"""
CGPGrey,324law,splendidfd,7,Fri Apr 10 15:45:30 2015 UTC,"Well, they can at least try."
CGPGrey,324law,SamuelRedmond,3,Fri Apr 10 16:05:47 2015 UTC,"This encapsulates my feelings on the matter very well. That said, if they did it in an honest, straightforward fashion that wasn't a money-grab, I'd pay the fee."
CGPGrey,324law,splendidfd,7,Fri Apr 10 15:16:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I know a lot of people, myself included, use ad-block and just white-list people they like. What's to stop people from continuing to do that? I'd much rather keep doing what I'm doing than pay a fee."
CGPGrey,324law,mattinthecrown,3,Fri Apr 10 15:20:16 2015 UTC,Pay the fee anyways but do it directly to the content creators.
CGPGrey,324law,future_weasley,2,Fri Apr 10 16:34:11 2015 UTC,The main thing stopping people I think is when it's a site like youtube where the url doesn't explicitly tell you who made the content. We can't just whitelist youtube channels we like and keep ones we don't blocked
CGPGrey,324law,Vicentti,23,Sat Apr 11 03:48:48 2015 UTC,"To be clear: the ad-free version isn't a paywall, it's an option for you and an 'option'* for me to participate in.  * All 'options' are mandatory."
CGPGrey,324law,gigitrix,2,Fri Apr 10 15:30:57 2015 UTC,So you cant decide whether you want to have the subscription thingie available?
CGPGrey,324law,nameltneGesreveR,4,Fri Apr 10 16:06:52 2015 UTC,"Probably not. Similar to Youtube's move on indy musicians (""you either join this new music agreement which forces you to upload to YT at the same time as anywhere else, and ALL songs must be on YT if you're selling them elsewhere - or you can't have a YT channel anymore"") - yes. I have heard all channels not agreeing will have all their videos turn ""private""."
CGPGrey,324law,theJavo,8,Fri Apr 10 16:43:11 2015 UTC,Not unless he wants to shut down his channel.
CGPGrey,324law,scorpiousdelectus,2,Sat Apr 11 08:44:51 2015 UTC,"From YouTube's point of view having an ad-free subscription service doesn't do any good if creators could just choose to force advertising anyway.  YouTube won't be forcing people to make videos premium-only, although it will probably be a (genuine) option."
CGPGrey,324law,cheezelz,4,Fri Apr 10 17:07:52 2015 UTC,"Giving people an option to pay to remove ads is fine, but if they end up blackmailing creators to participate in this or all their videos will be set to private (or their ability to put ads on videos will be taken away), and then they chuck in an incredibly restrictive five-year contract for good measure, that's the issue. I wouldn't put it past YouTube to do this either, seems like they'll do anything to retain their near monopoly on online video"
CGPGrey,324law,td2910,2,Sat Apr 11 11:35:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think mandatory participation is too big of a problem (the subscription wouldn't be nearly as useful if you still had to watch ads from non-participating creators), as long as creators can still monetise their videos to free users in the way they always have. Forcing preroll commercials plus a popup and sidebar on every video for free viewers would be a problem, but I doubt they'd do it.  It would also be a problem if YouTube started to enforce a time delay between releasing videos to the paid and free users, like Vessel, but that doesn't seem to be part of this mandatory agreement."
CGPGrey,324law,tetelesti,5,Sat Apr 11 02:27:14 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised how many happily say they use adblock.  I turn it off on youtube.  To me, I just cannot justify denying youtube and content creators any means of making money.  If I'm not going to pay for it, I can at least suffer through the ads.  I'm not sure if I want to pay for youtube; it's a matter of whether the cost is worth the ads or not, and that will depend on price.  But it's got to be one or the other for me."
CGPGrey,324law,tribesman,7,Sat Apr 11 11:51:30 2015 UTC,"i think that your ""adblock absolution"" is a much better way to approach this topic. I won't be paying $10 a month. Vessel is much cheaper, so it makes more sense.  I get the saas (Netflix) business model, but youtube doesn't have enough content for me to even consider it. Aside from the 5-10 educational channels I watch, the rest is dispensable from my life."
CGPGrey,324law,TheWhitePianoKey,9,Fri Apr 10 15:44:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't pay for the subscription. Although I love your videos, the $10 for a subscription (according to the verge) is not worth it. You make videos once a month so it's like paying $10 for a video. I'd rather watch the ads. Also if YouTube forces you to join this paid sub or you choose to join and you gain a large amount of subs, I fear it might make you try to put out more videos of lower quality rather than what you have now."
CGPGrey,324law,ChefBoyarDEZZNUTZZ,22,Fri Apr 10 16:08:26 2015 UTC,I fear it might make you try to put out more videos of lower quality rather than what you have now.   I've arranged my business as best I can so financial considerations do not drive video production.
CGPGrey,324law,Wout12345,4,Fri Apr 10 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"It seems like there's a lot of unnecessary discussion about creators ""opting out"" of this. YouTube's ad revenue model has always been completely opaque to the content creator: you get told by them that your CPM was x and then a check arrives.  I see this simply as a means for the user to ""buy"" the ad inventory they would otherwise be served. Unless the CPM tanks relative to serving those users ads (unlikely), it's just another piece of the black box."
CGPGrey,324law,Halfbloood,5,Fri Apr 10 15:42:02 2015 UTC,"My worry is that advertisers will find a way to advertise to subscribers since those are the people they actually want to advertise to, not the adblockers or free consumers. They want to reach an audience that has the means and will to pay for whatever product they are advertising."
CGPGrey,324law,juniegrrl,2,Fri Apr 10 15:22:26 2015 UTC,10 dollars is too high.   It's more than Netflix and you are getting nothing new or exclusive it's to much to ask for the convenience when Adblock is free and most ads aren't that much of a bother.   I feel that this will give YouTube cause to make the ads more bothersome and intrusive on our viewing experience in order to give incentive for us to pay up for the privilege of watching YouTube with out being assaulted with ads.
CGPGrey,324law,jakepw,3,Fri Apr 10 15:41:22 2015 UTC,"""creators are required to participate in the subscription offering, or every video on their channels will be set to private""  What the actual fuck"
CGPGrey,324law,Dumbrosie1,4,Fri Apr 10 16:17:56 2015 UTC,I have adblock so....
CGPGrey,324law,MiG_Pilot_87,4,Fri Apr 10 16:50:42 2015 UTC,"on our end, i think it's fine. if some people wish to have no ads and are willing to pay for it, in my mind it's no different than paying for an ad-free version of a game on your phone so you aren't bothered. what worries me is what is happening on the creator's side? philip defranco mentioned in a video yesterday that creators would be required to participate in the subscription service, therefore i assume some content would be kept from non-paying viewers. that's something i would be sad about, since my views and likes still help out my favorite creators (in addition to services like patreon). granted, that specific part of the new subscription service was only a rumor from the verge.   aside from that, this does represent a huge shift in youtube. it might be a measure to compete against the netflixes and hulus of the world. if it compensates the creators enough, maybe they might be able to push out more or better content."
CGPGrey,324law,ButterMyBiscuit,2,Wed Apr 22 21:55:43 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much how I feel. I'd rather deal with the ads than pay $10 a month until my income becomes more steady, even though they're getting more and more annoying. But is that really the only difference, or will the content be limited for non-paying viewers?  And what does this all mean for creators, who, if I'm understanding correctly, are being forced to potentially change the way they run their channels?  I think this is a very risky move on YouTube's part."
CGPGrey,324law,mrwazsx,3,Fri Apr 10 15:25:06 2015 UTC,"If there's any truth in the Verge article, I would find 10$ / month quite a lot. That's in the Netflix ballpark. For no premium content whatsoever, I don't think that is a good deal.  Also, I don't get this:   creators are required to participate in the subscription offering, or every video on their channels will be set to private, sources said.   Did they mean to say unlisted here? That would at least vaguely make sense - creators only getting traffic from sites linking / embedding the video, not YouTube directly - but setting them private is essentially the same as deleting them in terms of revenue right?"
CGPGrey,324law,freedomgeek,3,Fri Apr 10 16:43:03 2015 UTC,"You NEED TO accept the subscription offer. Or you accept it, or you just DON'T monetize your videos: "". If you do not understand or accept any part of these Terms, you should not upload Content for monetization on YouTube."" (source: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6204741?hl=en)  so, if you do not accept the new terms, you should just stay away from youtube. Youtube gives you no choices, ever."
CGPGrey,324law,quinterbeck,3,Fri Apr 10 15:25:57 2015 UTC,"It will also let creators put their videos behind a paywall so that only subscribers to the premium version can view them, sources said.   Fuck. That."
CGPGrey,324law,d_stilgar,3,Fri Apr 10 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"Mostly wondering what the profit cut between Youtube and the creators will be, considering they removed the cut for the advertizer from the picture. To be honest, if they go for something typical like $10/month, I'd expect creators to  have their revenue increased quite a bit, as the money the average viewer generates every month through ad revenue probably isn't even $1.  Personally looking forward to how this will go. Also, since I don't advertize on my own channel, I'm wondering whether or not I'd get the same cut (albeit tiny, I'm not saying I have a big channel or anything) as fully advertized videos or no cut, as the viewers wouldn't be removing any ads."
CGPGrey,324law,eaglekepr,3,Sat Apr 11 08:56:45 2015 UTC,"If it's a simple ad-free sub for a monthly fee, I'm all for it. But there's no way to know what this thing is really about until they annonce it. The ""YouTube-will-set-your-videos-to-private"" sound aggressive and imperialistic. I hope they will not force something on us knowing we might not have a choice... If I want not to monetize my videos and go with a member supported system, I wish they would let me.  I reserve my judgement."
CGPGrey,324law,Tvavtalavo,3,Fri Apr 10 15:19:08 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the comparisons to Netflix. Netflix content is made available through studios and contracted creators. YouTube allows 'regular' people to have access to viewers for their content directly.   I certainly get $10 worth of pleasure from YouTube monthly, so I would pay the fee to be ad-free. (I do not use ad-blocker software, because I believe in paying for what I consume.) I am an adult with a stable job, so it's not a burden to me. I suspect the number of us who will pay for a subscription may be enough to keep ads from becoming more loud and obnoxious for the rest of the unpaid viewers.  However, I strongly suspect that not nearly enough of the subscription revenue will actually end up with the creators I most want to support, so I will continue to contribute to Patreon for the creators using that service, to be sure they get the financial benefits they need to continue to create quality content."
CGPGrey,324law,himynameisdave9,3,Fri Apr 10 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of it, as long as it stays optional."
CGPGrey,324law,Vadermort,3,Fri Apr 10 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"My biggest worry is that this might be all they're doing to the site. The whole idea of injecting more money into the system seems good to me if it means more fixes and features get done faster. But YouTube, as of 4/10/2015, is buggy as hell for viewers as well as creators. I could make a list of problems, but I don't have the time. If this is part of a re-focusing on making YouTube better, I'm all for it. If this is a set it and forget it money-making idea, it'll probably hurt the site in the long run."
CGPGrey,324law,CSMastermind,3,Fri Apr 10 16:56:21 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:  I don't care, the long ones have a skip button, some short ones have skip buttons, and I watch most of my youtube on my computer (google chrome + Adblock).  It would only affect my phone, which I don't really care that much.  Now Id it's ""even though CGPGrey has turned off ads, we're gonna put them up anyways.""  I have a problem with that.  It should only be available if you (the content creator aka spreader/creator of mind germs) want the ad, but I don't think youtube would change that."
CGPGrey,324law,jwortham,3,Fri Apr 10 20:42:10 2015 UTC,"My response: What ads?  By the way, is there a way to just gift you $5 or something one time instead of subbing to Patreon? Or subbing, letting one billing cycle go through, then remembering to cancel my subscription before it charges me again, but not canceling my first payment. I do feel bad for using adblock and you've entertained me, but I don't like Patreon."
CGPGrey,324law,trIkly,3,Sat Apr 11 01:00:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know, you haven't told me yet."
CGPGrey,324law,statistically_viable,3,Sat Apr 11 06:10:45 2015 UTC,As long as nothing changes I'm fine with it. I won't buy it but if other want to good for them.  If they start doing things like getting rid of the skip feature to drive people into buying subscriptions however I will be somewhat miffed.
CGPGrey,324law,_JustToComment,2,Sat Apr 11 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"creators are required to participate in the subscription offering, or every video on their channels will be set to private   Clarification please. Is a 'creator' someone who earns money from youtube, or anyone who posts a video?"
CGPGrey,324law,thepokeman92,2,Mon Apr 13 12:55:32 2015 UTC,"I use Adblock so I don't see ads. I turned off for old times sake. Man ads suck.  I don't see what the big deal is. If users want to see ads, video producers still get a cut. If users pay to remove ads, video users get a cut of that.  What I would like to know, is what they think that cut will be to producers. Is it going to be more or less money? If the heaviest users watch 10,000 videos a month, how does their $5 subscription get split? Is this less money than if they saw embedded ads on my channel?  I really don't see this as being a big worry for producers. Things seem to be more or less the same. Make videos. Try to get people to watch them. When people watch them you get money.   I would be interested in individual channel subscriptions like Twitch or Patreon, etc. If google wants to cut into those businesses, then it could be really really lucrative for video producers."
CGPGrey,324law,french_toste,2,Fri Apr 10 17:33:50 2015 UTC,"Ads are annoying (Chromecast is the most frequent banner ad, even more annoying because I already have it).  However I'm not going to pay yet-another-subscription to get rid of the current combination of banner/pre-roll/unskippable.  My favorites will get more from me via Patreon and I will be quick on the banner 'x'/Skip This buttons.  Unfortunately when this comes to pass and YT makes ALL monetized videos have 2min unskippable ads... I'll have to reconsider :(  Edit to add:  WTH kind of business model is ""this thing we do that interupts your entertainment?  It's REALLY annoying, right?  We could make it go away for a little... compensation""  Oh, that's right.  That's what the mafia does..."
CGPGrey,324law,french_toste,2,Fri Apr 10 17:35:48 2015 UTC,"If this increases your upload rate, I could not care less."
CGPGrey,324law,stevetursi,2,Fri Apr 10 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"If you guys dip from YouTube I'd follow.  Lots of these now decade-old startups with insane amounts of users just get all dollar-signs-for-eyes, like Facebook."
CGPGrey,324law,piwikiwi,2,Tue Apr 14 23:01:39 2015 UTC,"While I feel that $10 is too high, I would almost happily pay it if something close to half, went into a pool that was only divided amongst the content creators I was actually watching.  Aside from the issues it poses for the creator, what really bothers me about (my understanding) of this new system is that I don't get to decide how to spend my money.   I want Youtube to make money, I want Grey and Brady to make money and the Green brothers etc. What I don't want is to pay for Joe Diddlefutz's lame Grey channel knock off to make money because he got himself in the same ill-defined subscription pool as the A-list creators.   I love me some Game of Thrones and I bought the books so GRRM makes more and I pay for HBO so the series will finish.  But I send a clear message to HBO too... I only pay for it when GoT is airing.  Once its locked down in my PVR, I call my cable co.  and tell them to cut it off.  I pay for Netflix because they produce some good content on their own and they provide me the ability to watch content that I could get elsewhere, but I can get it whenever I want.    If YT wants to distribute resources to all or segments of their creators let it come from their resources.  I am also concerned about the nefarious content Gerrymandering that their contract appears to allow.  ""What's that Grey, doing really well?  Hmmm, can't have you getting to far ahead, I guess we will have to redefine what box your channel goes in so we can keep the playing field even"".    I am already supremely frustrated I have no control over which ads I see,  I am routinely getting bombarded by ads from the Mormon Church (probably because I watch enough atheist stuff, it puts me in their ideal audience).  Facebook is bloody awful and I can't guarantee contact with my friends without getting even damn post they make; but at least I can shape which ads reach my feed, and can report ads I REEALLY hate.  You want higher click rates, maybe target your audience better and show them things they want."
CGPGrey,324law,mattinthecrown,2,Wed Apr 15 00:22:50 2015 UTC,"So I listened to the podcast today and I wasn't surpsied to hear about the new system.  I actually thought: haven't I heard about this before?  Then I remembered this Wall St. Journal article from Feburary.  Here's some of the relevant parts:   Google Inc. nurtured YouTube into a cultural phenomenon, attracting more than one billion users each month. Still, YouTube hasn’t become a profitable business.   Okay so this is probably the driver for Google's motivation to further monetize the service.     Google executives want them to turn on YouTube the way they turn on television, as a habit, where they can expect to find different “channels” of entertainment.    I would say CGP Grey's analysis of YouTube becoming like a cable package is spot on.   In 2012, YouTube paid hundreds of millions of dollars to content producers, an early effort to create television-like channels.   ...    But many of those channels failed.   They then reference this article from October of last year where they broke the story about the new ad free system.  Both are worth a quick read.  There's another article I can't find right now where an executive at YouTube was quoted as saying (and I'm paraphrasing): ""If YouTube wants to make cable TV like ad revenue, they need to implement a TV like model.""  Personally I'd think it's almost certain that the future of YouTube will be more TV like."
CGPGrey,324law,Samphire,2,Fri Apr 17 00:48:14 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of and ad free Youtube.  To be frank though my feels are more motivated by the type of ads shown not the need to remove all ads.  Both my kids love watching Youtube and the ads don't always match content rating.  It would be nice to have the option to pay a little extra to specific channels, similar to Twitch.  Unlike Netflix or Hulu, YouTube fosters a sense of community and loyalty to specific channels.  I know there are other services that handle this, but if it was seamless I think channels would see a lot high adoption.     Random thought:  If there are no ads I would like the ability to download videos for offline viewing.  This would be great for when I travel."
CGPGrey,324law,poogpoogs,2,Fri Apr 17 03:24:24 2015 UTC,"The thing that concerns me is, will users stop using Patreon if they pay for YouTube? One of the reasons to pay on Patreon is to watch videos ad free without guilt (using adblock).  Which is the other issue: YouTube now has a huge incentive to stop adblock or at least make it less useful (ala Hulu). What's the point in paying to stop ads if free software will do the same thing?  Sure, CGP Grey has other platforms, but most of YouTube doesn't."
CGPGrey,324law,piwikiwi,2,Fri Apr 17 13:56:18 2015 UTC,I'm curious is google greedy or is youtube just becoming unprofitable
CGPGrey,324law,Dekost,2,Sun Apr 19 01:44:32 2015 UTC,YouTube servers/UI / just generalness isn't good enough to warrant real money being given. Id rather watch the adverts
CGPGrey,324law,nvernon123,2,Sun Apr 19 05:04:50 2015 UTC,"I don't like this idea at all. From what I can understand as to how the payment system works, the same monthly fee is split among the YT creators based on the percentage of your time spent watching each of their videos as a whole. This seems to be discouraging any sort of creator collaboration, because with this sort of system, it is in the best interests of the creators to make sure their fans watch as many of their own videos and as few of other creator's videos as possible.   Not only that, I have problems with paying for YouTube period, the service is always very spotty to me, I have problems with some 1080p videos just not playing properly (despite having an overkill CPU and GPU for the job that runs modern games fine), the bandwidth is despicable at times, and most importantly, I don't even want to think about some youtube videos winding up behind paywalls as ""premium only"" content.  Finally, there are some people I would support (and in fact I support a few on Patreon), but there are others that I would prefer not to support via any sort of monetization. As far as I'm aware, I don't see a way to delegate where my funding goes, so I'd prefer the old patreon/donation method. However, I'm not a YT creator so I'd be interested in hearing what a few of them might thing about this whole thing."
CGPGrey,324law,SHD_lotion,2,Tue Apr 28 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"I sure hope this isn't the beginning of the end. You just know that less scrupulous channels are going to be all over this with paywall content.  The sub stuff being quietly introduced as an option for those who choose to use it (Twitch-style), would be fine- being able to support creators directly in exchange for ad-free entertainment is a great idea.  But being forced on everybody by leveraging all existing content as ransom? That's some heavy-handed shit. Sounds like a ""No make us more money though"" memo came down from the fat cats in the penthouse."
CGPGrey,324law,mattinthecrown,2,Wed Apr 29 03:14:39 2015 UTC,"I, for one, am willing to switch to whichever Youtube competitor everyone ends up moving to."

CGPGrey,324law,HorsePal,2,Thu Apr 30 03:22:48 2015 UTC,"I think it is a bad idea. I rather subscribe directly to the youtubers that I like, just like twitch does."
CGPGrey,324law,Krisarruda,2,Fri Apr 10 15:13:07 2015 UTC,Most youtube content isn't conducive to a paywall.  And I certainly don't want content behind a paywall.
CGPGrey,324law,Gicecool,3,Fri Apr 10 15:16:43 2015 UTC,"Neither is twitch's content. When you Subscribe on Twitch, all you get are some custom emotes and a little marker to show you're a sub. No paywall."
CGPGrey,324law,Gicecool,2,Fri Apr 10 15:37:38 2015 UTC,"well, some things, like VODs are still occasionally paywalled, but I see your point. Regardless, I don't think youtube is all that condicuve to paywalling."
CGPGrey,324law,cyberflunk,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:49:23 2015 UTC,The subscription is voluntary and you can still watch it if you don't subscribe.
CGPGrey,324law,dblake123,2,Fri Apr 10 16:01:34 2015 UTC,"If that means more money to creators and consequently better videos, I would pay for it - as long as the price is reasonable. Living off of YouTube is so complicated that I think creators would only benefit from having more resources to create better content. Not sure how they're going to deal with the Ad block thing though."
CGPGrey,324law,NotSoSuperNerd,2,Fri Apr 10 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"It's a nice thought to not have them, but I can handle the current level of ads on YouTube. Unless they really stepped up the amount of ads, I probably wouldn't ever subscribe to an ad free version."
CGPGrey,324law,d999j,2,Fri Apr 10 15:19:03 2015 UTC,"If it isn't too expensive (like 20$ a month) then I would definitely go for it.  I can afford it, It's a way to support random youtubers (that I don't support otherwise), and ads are annoying as hell on mobile."
CGPGrey,324law,intenselyseasoned,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:19:29 2015 UTC,"I'd be surprised if they asked much more than $10 a month, which is about what I'd consider paying."
CGPGrey,324law,jimeviljim,2,Fri Apr 10 15:19:33 2015 UTC,I don't see a problem with it. Other online systems have ad-free-for-money systems. Also many youtubers have tip-services like patreon. And now there's Vessel which is just a paid youtube. There's just more money to be made if you get money directly from the consumer instead of through advertisers. I can't imagine that they make $10 through ads per person per month.  The only issue I see is if YouTube makes the ads more annoying to try to get you to switch.  Also ad-block works really well now so they'll probably make it harder to block ads.
CGPGrey,324law,phalanfy,2,Fri Apr 10 15:39:25 2015 UTC,"I love this move without reservation. I have always used adblockers, all the way from Firefox 2 to Chrome dev today. I'm not a prick, I don't think so at least, I just abhor the ad noise, so to hell with the consequences, the most important one being how conflicted about it I feel.  This takes that weight off my shoulders. This is how it should be.  I pay for my Spotify, and I'l happily pay for a noise-free personalized 21st century TV that nurtures the creators I love."
CGPGrey,324law,kisu999,2,Fri Apr 10 15:23:42 2015 UTC,The ads don't bother me that much. I'm ok with the way things are now.
CGPGrey,324law,GHurst,2,Fri Apr 10 15:24:26 2015 UTC,"If Youtube thinks of enough ways to give money to you (f.e. sms (I'm a student and I don't use 90% of my prepaid and I can't buy a cheaper prepaid), paypal, iDeal (think that's something only for dutchies), etc. etc.) I sure want to pay you some money to help you."
CGPGrey,324law,nerdfighter123,2,Fri Apr 10 15:24:28 2015 UTC,"By the way, I really want to know how Youtube compares channels in order to give them money. I want a twitch subscrition mode, not paying for channels I barely watch, only because I like some of it. You f.e. don't make a lot of video's, but you are the one I am most likely to give money to. If the YT bot thinks that I care about channels I watch a lot, it is totally wrong."
CGPGrey,324law,tehbored,2,Fri Apr 10 15:24:48 2015 UTC,"google's hamfisted ""our way or no way"" is not to be supported. I'll continue with patreon. this method of support enables people that can't pay to still get content, and... it's not google."
CGPGrey,324law,Kitworks,2,Fri Apr 10 15:29:19 2015 UTC,I think you tube is going down the tubes. The interface isn't as nice as it used to be and they're not as nice to their content people as the use to be.
CGPGrey,324law,qang007,2,Fri Apr 10 15:37:14 2015 UTC,"YouTube's ads aren't nearly as intrusive as most other websites I frequent, so I'm not really interested in a paid subscription. If the ads become too much of a problem (like they have on other sites), I would just remove YouTube from Adblock's whitelist."
CGPGrey,324law,MarkusThorr,2,Fri Apr 10 15:50:18 2015 UTC,"If I could choose who gets the money, it would be not a problem for me but if YouTube chooses I would definitely NOT pay for that. It is my money so I want to decide what happens with it. But because YouTube is a company, they will most likely make it intransparent and weird, in which case I would just continue supporting you and my other favorite creators on Patreon and Subbable."
CGPGrey,324law,TheHmed,2,Fri Apr 10 15:53:57 2015 UTC,I think overall it's an okay plan. It definitely seems very pricey and should probably come with more benefits. With $10 a month I would much rather have a Hulu Plus account.
CGPGrey,324law,Seamy18,2,Fri Apr 10 16:10:09 2015 UTC,"I'd buy it, provided it's fair to creators. I'm not going to pay for it if it isn't, because then it's not really much different than just blocking ads.  I think it makes sense to force monetization partners to participate. An ad-free youtube option really wouldn't work if it only applied to some ads. And I really want an ad-free option where I'm not stealing content.  I'd be interested in hearing if being forced into this is really something frustrating to a creator like you. Also if this is a matter of framing (or perhaps over-zealous policy). If it was just ""hey now instead of showing a user an ad sometimes we will just pay you about what you'd make and not show that ad"" would it be an easier sell? Obviously with ""about what you'd make"" better fleshed out.  One issue with payment I thought about on my commute was balancing the payments is very tricky. Even beyond the obvious issues (playtime vs views)... what about someone who subscribes to support independent creators but also watches 8 hours of music video in the background while at work? The amount that'd make it outside of that block would be miniscule. Like, smaller than ad revenue miniscule.  [disclaimer: I work at Google on nothing remotely related to YouTube. Yes, I've tried to get them to fix the subscription box.]"
CGPGrey,324law,platypocalypse,2,Fri Apr 10 16:16:25 2015 UTC,"I won't pay to just not have ads, I have a free method to obtain that. What I would pay for is for a better YouTube experience where its not throwing sponsored content at me constantly.   I'm sure Jimmy Fallon is a nice guy and all but what in the hell does he have to do with videos about Scandinavia?  And all the interface 'features' that seem to be designed to illicit more views like global autoplay."
CGPGrey,324law,stedcookie,2,Fri Apr 10 16:19:24 2015 UTC,"If it's done like Humble Bundle does it (You can choose who gets your money) or like Twitch does it, it'll be good. If it's divided among the people you're subscribed to, I'll understand why they did it and be a little mad. If it's by view I wont be angry, I'll be disappointed."
CGPGrey,324law,GlassOrange,2,Fri Apr 10 16:45:41 2015 UTC,As someone who both consumes a large amount of YouTube videos and creates content I'm torn between using AdBlock and hoping others don't use it on me. Using AdBlock is a much better system for those who don't want ads. However as a creator I feel at least somewhat guilty for using it. This new system seems like something that could work if the people with the highest volume of YouTube consumption weren't also the most frequent users of AdBlock.
CGPGrey,324law,Hobobling,2,Fri Apr 10 16:50:07 2015 UTC,Honestly I believe that this was a smart move by Youtube. It's not like they're losing anything by making this subscription plan(although I hope they won't try to add more ads to entice viewers to subscribe). I still believe that I'd rather just give the creator money on Patreon where 95% of the money I give would reach the creators I support and not just 55%(which would probably not all go to the creator; most of it is probably going to go to the already big Youtubers who don't need the money like Pewdiepie). I believe that Youtube should have done something to help smaller creators who don't necessarily get the most views; but have a much more active communities.
CGPGrey,324law,commanderpepper,2,Fri Apr 10 17:20:55 2015 UTC,"I would strongly consider paying given that I feel guilty for using adblock. However, I don't watch nearly as much YouTube as I do Netflix, and the price is about the same, so I'm not sure I'll actually sign up unless creators actually start pay walling content."
CGPGrey,324law,indomitablecat,2,Fri Apr 10 17:32:59 2015 UTC,It sounds like a great deal for Youtube... and not so great for content creators or viewers.
CGPGrey,324law,atmarsden95,2,Fri Apr 10 18:20:53 2015 UTC,"In theory this would be something I would be interested in, but only if the participation of content creators was voluntary.  I already support several creators via patreon (using the money saved by cutting cable out of my life) and I hate advertisements with a passion.  Youtube currently hosts several creators that I follow and if they told me that they were voluntarily joining Youtube's paid service I would pay $10/mo to continue to watch their content.  If the creators are being coerced however, I would much rather support them on a different medium (vessel, vimeo, etc.) then pay the extortion fee.  Whatever you ultimately decide to do Grey, know that I am subscribed to the email list and will follow your channel wherever you decide to take it.  Thanks for the content."
CGPGrey,324law,BoozeoisPig,2,Fri Apr 10 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"Given how much I watch YouTube I don't think it's not worth the money, but I have little to no problem with the ads that are there already so I probably won't pay for an ad-free version. I would if there were a lot of videos hidden behind the paywall from creators I like, however."
CGPGrey,324law,jasonadam,2,Fri Apr 10 22:00:11 2015 UTC,My worry is that kids young enough not to have a bank account will not be able to pay for any of this. Ads are one thing but they dont require a sign up with a debit/credit card. I think you can look at this two ways too: Let's Plays and such like Minecraft vids are immensely popular but I'm guessing viewed mainly by <18 years olds. The other kind is educational vids like Sal and his Khan Academy. Would be terrible to put them behind a paywall for disadvantaged people  Edit: spelling
CGPGrey,324law,Datyedyeguy,2,Fri Apr 10 23:28:47 2015 UTC,"Anything that doesn't affect the current formation directly I am happy with. I'm fine with the £10 a month format for Add Free videos, but I don't like a system where god forbid some those who pay get videos that non-paying plebs won't have access to otherwise.   I don't mind any changes that give viewers more options on how they watch, but I don't want the way I watch to be directly affected. What I would like to see youtube solving is the mobile view thing - I've heard that youtube don't pay content creators for mobile views. That seems crazy to me, borderline stealing, considering 50-60% of views come from mobile devices these days (keep in mind that the xbox and playstation youtube apps count as mobile too). Unfortunately I don't think that that problem will be solved anytime soon."
CGPGrey,324law,White667,2,Sat Apr 11 02:33:53 2015 UTC,They'll just end up showing ads to the people who pay anyway. That's how it works. Cable was originally supposed to be ad-free.  I'm still mad at YouTube for forcing me to turn on Autoplay.
CGPGrey,324law,White667,2,Sat Apr 11 10:44:43 2015 UTC,"I see this as being incredibly negative for you, Grey. If I watch all of Brady's Videos in one month and your one video in a month then you will get significantly less revenue as I will have watched less of your work even though it would have been 100% of your work output."
CGPGrey,324law,jasconx,2,Sat Apr 11 13:19:21 2015 UTC,"I lost my faith in YouTube when they made Google + accounts either mandatory or a pain to avoid signing up for. I thought it is was beneath them to push something so hard just to clearly serve their own agenda.   YouTube holds a lot of cards though.  Vessel comes in and chips away at some of YT's stronghold and they're not happy. So they want to minimize the loss by offering a similar (what is probably considered to be a key) benefit.    While this move might change the landscape for YouTube creators (as discussed from Nerd 3) and YT might make some small financial gains, it won't remove all the dissatisfaction surrounding their platform. I look forward to seeing them lose their monopoly."
CGPGrey,324law,l_ugray,4,Sat Apr 11 20:26:04 2015 UTC,"I use Addblock Plus so I don't watch adds now anyways, why would I start paying?"
CGPGrey,324law,jeffreylees,2,Mon Apr 13 02:46:08 2015 UTC,They will allow you to store videos offline for personal use. This may be great for music but I don't know how it help Youtubers. You would also give Youtube creators you like more money (possibly). Then again Patreon exists.
CGPGrey,324law,terrafin,2,Fri Apr 10 17:25:54 2015 UTC,Well my YT experience is ad-free so nope I would not pay for it. #adblock

In really trying to reserve judgement until I can see the actual new TOS for creators... In not going to get anything out of this with the kind of viewerships I expect, but I think my status as a fledgling creator is closing my ability to think about it as a consumer...  I'm currently a soft opposition until I can see the full details."
CGPGrey,324law,Siecje1,2,Fri Apr 10 15:18:39 2015 UTC,"I think they should bring back the old video ranking system (1-5 stars) in order to determine dividend worthiness. Because now that you are paying $120 a year to YouTube for the purpose of watching videos on it without ads then YouTube should take into consideration your personal opinion on how entertained you were by particular content, because that has a direct factor into whether or not you decide to fork over that nice little chunk of change.number of minutes spent on a video and number of videos should have a factor too, but strong votes of approval should be able to be taken and tallied because those are the sorts of things that indicate willingness to pay for a subscription fee."
CGPGrey,324law,ZitarPlayer,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:34:48 2015 UTC,Like it as a consumer. Concerned about how it will affect content creators. It's going to be hard to divide up subscription fees in a way that's going to seem fair to content creators.

CGPGrey,324law,c0ber,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:17:13 2015 UTC,The only thing I think about the subscription is that it won't be long until it goes the way of Hulu. I think the ads will sneak back in after a few months to years. At least it was a free service for as long as it is. I do however pay for an ad free pandora and I don't think I could go back. As long as the price is right I will be signing up.
CGPGrey,324law,J_Nerdy,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:23:22 2015 UTC,"I would consider it at the right price, but would rather support content creators more directly and watch off YouTube, provided that the majority of the people whose content I wanted to watch had systems with RSS in place for doing so in one convenient location... which is to say probably not in the near future."

That said, this model seems to me to be an inherently one to force creators such as yourself into, that have a (relatively) smaller amount of content. If the split depends upon total watch time won't you end up getting a little shafted?   Have you done any projections on income between the current and future model or do you not have enough data to try?  I'd rather see people move off the platform than be railroaded into something that isn't viable for them.

Perhaps I just don't consume enough YouTube videos but I would say I'm more prolific compared to many I know. I don't think the volume I watch is worth a subscription to not see ads."
CGPGrey,324law,dakkeh,1 point,Fri Apr 10 15:20:18 2015 UTC,YouTube can cut out patron and still provide ads for people that don't pay.   If YouTube is hosting videos without ads they don't make money which hurt all youtubers in the long run.

I usually go to the nearest coffee place for a change of scenery and work it out on paper. Over the years I've developed a habit of always ordering the same thing in the same way (including inflections and gestures). That way I can order without taking my mind off of the problem. What happens is that the waiters/bartenders catch up to this quickly and stop asking.  I have to do this 3 or four times at a new place, but soon enough they'll just look at me with raised eyebrows and i'll nod to get my coffee. Before long i'll just come to the place, sit at a table and start working, and coffee will just magically appear next to my papers. I tip well, and pay for things i didn't order (i never object and tip extra if they refill an empty cup without bothering me). I don't tolerate socializing, and they don't seem to mind. So, I get an optimized service, and they get a no-hassle customer: works for everybody."

For example: we're all in this prison (unwarranted conversation) together (hot tip: waiters don’t really want to talk to you; Or want to remember details about you as opposed to the rest of the hundreds of customers they have daily). I found it strange in this podcast that Grey was aware how well students and parents embrace his straightforward approach, but didn't consider extending the same curtesy to waiters. Is it really that hard to say: ""Can we please not do this, I'm just here for the coffee; The less time and effort I have to put into it, the more I'm willing to pay for it"". Consider it, crowdfunding a customer-service style."

CGPGrey,30se1a,wontooforate,43,Mon Mar 30 16:37:55 2015 UTC,"Listening to the podcast while performing surgeries! o/   I just recently discovered the podcast and have been binge-listening. Brilliant.   I'm just popping by to mention (as per one episode way back) that I do perform surgeries listening to podcasts and audiobooks. It's not a big deal, mostly because these are all routine surgeries any trained surgeon would perform in their sleeps, and when (the rare) complications do arise, all extraneous distractions are immediately shut off (operating theatres are noisy environments, after all). Delicate, extra-ordinary, or particularly difficult surgeries are, of course, off limits for podcasts, or music, or any other distractants.   A bored surgeon is much more inattentive, and these routine surgeries can be very mundane after 500 or 1,000 of them. So, for the past couple of weeks, all of my patients have been operated on by Drs. Haran and Grey!  One other note: I arrived here via CGPGrey's channel, which has been info-taining me for years, now. I had never watched Brady Haran's channels before, but now that I've been introduced to them, I have to say I am amazed how I'd ever missed them. They are all brilliant! PTV, NP, PP, BD, and especially DSV. Great stuff! Kudos, mate."

It's too much of a hassle to wear headphones, they can get uncomfortable, it's difficult to lower the volume if the need arises and most importantly, it's a infectious risk. I wouldn't want someone's headphones falling in me."

CGPGrey,30se1a,Kree_The_Pirate,4,Mon Mar 30 14:06:41 2015 UTC,I don't think you should feel confused. Reddit is a forum where the choice to converse is completely within your agency.

I would always have a book that I would read. I ordered the same drink, and the same food every time. Eventually all I had to do was sit down. My drink and food would appear with out ever have to say a word or even put my book down. Because I knew the price I could leave the correct amount on the table and not even have to deal with a person while paying. Of course it helped that I tipped VERY well."

CGPGrey,30se1a,SpeedLimit55,12,Mon Mar 30 10:24:11 2015 UTC,"I think as much as everyone gives him this robot-like persona (himself included sometimes) deep down he must have had at least SOME romantic notion about being a teacher; even if it was something as simple as a desire to mold a future generation in some small way.   He complains about the education system, and the hardships of being a teacher, but I'd wager his teaching years were likely some of his fondest memories."
CGPGrey,30se1a,mattyw83,15,Mon Mar 30 14:56:19 2015 UTC,"I mean, think about what he does now? It is not fundamentally different from teaching. Just some structural changes, as well as his ability to curate the content. But he is still teaching.  Now whether this is from some romantic ideal (I doubt it) or just because that is the type of personality he has I don't know, but I don't think his career change is really that big of a leap. It is still ""teach people, make money."""

CGPGrey,30se1a,gavers,29,Mon Mar 30 08:57:40 2015 UTC,They recorded this on the day after the Germanwings crash so there wasn't really much information about the cause out there. Source
CGPGrey,30se1a,SpeedLimit55,7,Mon Mar 30 09:15:25 2015 UTC,"I was trying to calculate when they recorded based on ""I just uploaded the Scandinavian video 4 hours ago""."
CGPGrey,30se1a,lumpking69,3,Mon Mar 30 10:10:25 2015 UTC,"This is what I assumed. I'm guessing they recorded this before the full extent of what happened was realized. Basically at that point all there was to discuss was that a plane went down and 150 people perished. They also had to have realized that anything they discussed would be horribly outdated by the time the podcast aired, so no reason to go into it yet, if indeed they decide to."
CGPGrey,30se1a,zombiepiratefrspace,48,Mon Mar 30 16:15:27 2015 UTC,I disagree. Isn't this exactly what plane crash corner is for? It can be done respectfully and discussed on the podcast. I really wanted to hear what Brady had to say about it.

Due to the circumstances, discussing it respectfully will require a bit more effort than usual and should be done with preparation, not in a manner of ""it happened this week so we have to do it now""."
CGPGrey,30se1a,bcartw,2,Mon Mar 30 09:53:14 2015 UTC,"As the subject of dreams and your reactions to them came up again in this podcast, I’d like to make a few points that I hope persuade you reconsider your position on listening to dreams and to the humans who have them.     When you talk about dreams, and how you don't want to hear about them, and how meaningless they are, I think you might be missing an important point - What's important isn't the dream CONTENT, it's the PERSON who is telling you the dream, and the EMOTIONS their dream has made them feel.  People tell each other their dreams for a variety of reasons, but most of them require a response in our social structure; the people telling you their dream expect it and by shutting down, you are acting counter to their expectations.     There are, what I would consider, 4 types of commonly shared dreams: Funny dreams, Meaningless dreams, Meaningful dreams, and Nightmares, with a lot of overlap.     Funny Dreams People tell each other funny dreams for the same reason people tell each other funny jokes or anecdotes.  The goal is to make the other person smile and/or laugh, which causes positive feelings in both parties.  This shared happiness brings both people pleasure and a stronger sense of companionship.  Naturally, the reaction if someone tells you a funny dream would be to smile, though, just like with a joke that isn't funny, sometimes dreams are only funny to teller, and the recipient’s smile or laugh must be forced.  It happens; sometimes jokes aren't funny or people aren't skilled at telling them.  Politeness requires a smile or small chuckle.     Meaningless Dreams In general, I agree with you about meaningless dreams.  Not worth telling, unless the dream is so absurd as to be amusing; then see Funny Dreams above.     Meaningful Dreams People tell each other meaningful dreams for the same reason people tell each other about their days when they get home from work.  When your significant other comes home and complains that the traffic was bad, mentions an interesting store display, and is excited that their coworker is having a baby, your job is to feign interest, (or better yet, BE interested).  The reason for this is that it conveys that this person, and what they choose to share with you, is important to you, regardless about how you actually feel about the events of your significant other's day.  The same is true with what they choose to share about their dreams.  Like it or not, many (I'd even go so far as to say 'most') people in this country at least, feel that there IS meaning in many dreams, and enjoy looking for and discussing this meaning with those they care about.  Additionally, dreams come with emotions attached.  The dream may be not be real, but the emotions felt by the dreamer certainly are.  Shutting down completely is basically telling them that both what they are feeling, and what they have chosen to share with you, aren't important to you, and this can be insulting.  Be aware.     One further note here, I'm not sure how you can hear about a dream where, for example, a person has a big musical concert or presentation coming up and they dream about performing badly the night before, and still think this is meaningless.  Dreams often reveal a conscious or subconscious anxiety or other emotions that the dreamer has been ignoring in their waking life.  These types of dreams seem pretty clear in their meaning to most people.     Nightmares I would classify 2 broad classes of nightmares - Rational (""I dreamed my grandmother died."") and Irrational (""I dreamed something was chasing me"").  However, both of these require similar responses.  People tell each other nightmares because they are looking for comfort and reassurance: sometimes specific reassurance, in the case of a rational nightmare, and sometimes more general reassurance in the case of an irrational one.  The only reason they're telling you the contents of the dream is to try and convey their emotional state in a meaningful way.  As a significant other, your job is to reassure them that you are there for them, that the dream wasn't real (yes they know this already; saying it helps to calm a panicked brain anyway), and to provide emotional support until they are calm again.  Telling someone you care about that you don't want to hear about their nightmare because it wasn't real, is a BIG social no-no.  This is again a case where the emotional state of the dreamer is FAR more important than the contents of the dream.  It's their emotional state you need to address and give attention to.      tl;dr People rarely tell you their dreams because they wish to inform you about the contents.  It's because they're looking for a social connection with you.  They want to make you laugh, or start a discussion about why their current job is making them nervous, or are looking for reassurance about their worry over their ailing parent, or are seeking comfort because of a terrible experience they've just had (albeit only in their minds, but still no less real emotionally).  It's important to understand and acknowledge that there is a social responsibility here to act the way people expect or risk losing social standing, (by which I mean people will be turned off and less likely to want to continue engaging with you).  This may not matter to you when dealing with some people, but I would suggest that you rethink that stance when dealing with people you really care about and whose opinions matter to you."

I had an argument with someone about this on reddit once and got downvoted to hell.  What is your opinion on this? Do you think that saying ""America"" is wrong, when you actually mean ""USA"" or do you just not care?  I have friends from South America that identify themselves as American sometimes and find it weird that the name gets used so loosely for USA."
CGPGrey,30976f,runetrantor,19,Wed Mar 25 15:55:41 2015 UTC,"My input: as a Canadian, I don't identify myself as an American. It just feels... wrong. Even if it is technically correct.   The big problem with America is that there are alternatives to what you can call the country (""USA"", or ""The United States"" both work fine), but there aren't any alternatives to call the people. They are just ""American.""  The problem with South America and Mexico is that the have that word. People who live in Los Estados Unidos de América are estadounidense. People who live in América (the continent) are americano.   Combined with the fact that in Canada and the United States (at least, I'm not positive where else), America isn't a continent. There is North America and South America. There is never any ambiguity when you say America. It always refers to the country.   I'm curious where you're from, what language(s) you speak, and how many continents you think there are. While you aren't wrong, I wouldn't really say you're right. It can be complicated. I'd love to hear back from you. Or anyone else really."

It's not unusual for people to identify from their continent...Europeans identify themselves as such, as well as French, German, Italian, etc. African/Asian too...but they still clarify with their country.  I find it hard to believe your South American friends don't also identify as Brazilian, Colombian, Peruvian, etc. If your friend travel pretty much anywhere and call themselves ""American"" people are not going to assume they are from South America, but from the USA because:  People from the USA use the term 'American' to identify themselves. They do not call themselves USAicans, or United Stateian or United States of America(n). It's just American.   Sorry if you disagree, but that's the way it is."

Swedish is related to Danish, but obviously is not its daughter language. Basically Faroese and Icelandic are much closer to Old Norse than Swedish, Danish and Norwegian are, for example they use additional non-Latin letters and retain the case system. And of course Norwegian is not directly related to Icelandic and Faroese."
CGPGrey,30976f,NorwegianWood28,7,Wed Mar 25 15:10:01 2015 UTC,Yeah the arrows is a bit missleading. That Faroese leads to icelandic and then norwegian is wrong wrong wrong. Then also the norwegian is heavy influenced from swedish and danish rule makes it more like a east scandiaivan dialect.  Nynorsk och Bokmål is also only for written form of norwegian.

CGPGrey,2zahmn,SleepyHarry,152,Tue Mar 17 09:15:20 2015 UTC,If you can get away with it.
CGPGrey,2zahmn,creative_sparky,30,Tue Mar 17 09:19:16 2015 UTC,"I feel this may need some clarification.  ""getting away with it"" doesn't just mean not getting in trouble or getting detention, it means that not only are you capable of being able to do what you need to get the results you need for whatever path you've set yourself; but also that you know that if/when you genuinely do need to do work, you're capable of actually working.  I'm speaking from a very personal viewpoint here - so I have no real idea of how widely this will apply - but I made the surprisingly damaging mistake of simply assuming that if/when I needed to do work outside of exams I would be able to. I have since learned (very much the hard way) that learning how to actually do work is really important.  I spent a huge percentage of my younger years perfecting work avoidance in every manifestation, and that is a really, really bad habit to get in to.  I know this may not get through to whoever ends up reading this, because if this applies to you, you probably won't even realise that it applies to you. I know I wouldn't have done when it actually mattered. My thought process would have been   ""lol yeah but I actually don't need to do the work, everything's really easy and I always do well on exams and understand stuff, so this doesn't apply. Stupid preachy internet stranger""   If this reads familiar, I AM TALKING TO YOU. I strongly urge you to re-read what I've said in a more introspective frame of mind and genuinely think about whether or not you'll be able to put effort into working when it matters.  And believe me, it will matter.    TL;DR: Homework itself isn't as important as some educational figures may have you believe, but it's super-duper important that you learn how to work while the work itself is of little consequence."
CGPGrey,2zahmn,jacenat,5,Tue Mar 17 23:57:17 2015 UTC,"I did fine without homework. Except for my 8th grade history teacher who made homework worth twice as much and made tests worth half as much for me specifically.

CGPGrey,2zahmn,BoormanTheGrey,7,Tue Mar 17 18:04:50 2015 UTC,Would you have removed homework entirely if given the option?
CGPGrey,2zahmn,Chipish,13,Tue Mar 17 18:48:43 2015 UTC,I had a professor in College who was about to retire. He did an experiment where he didn't grade any homework. He showed us the results from the tests and there was a clear correlation between people who did no homework and did poorly on the tests.  Do your homework if you care about learning.
CGPGrey,2zahmn,TheOnlyMeta,10,Tue Mar 17 19:29:25 2015 UTC,correlation does not mean causation it could be because the kind of people who do there homework are the kind of people who do good on tests no matter what

Google uses my location as well as my past history of visiting the ABC to rank the right ABC for me much higher than it probably does for you (unless you happen to also be Australian).  The inherent problem with DuckDuckGo is that they specifically don't want to do the thing that makes Google results so great. Their shtick is privacy, and I get that some people like that. I don't really understand why they do, but they have every right to go after that if they want. It's just that they do pay the price in terms of lower quality search results."

If the improvement in results is worth giving them your history is up to each individual.   I periodically compare the results I get from Google (logged in) / Google (incognito) / DuckDuckGo and I think I would go mental without my contextualised ones. For example: I'm a developer and use a library called ""Spray"". No login Google & DDG give me results mostly concerning beauty salons or deodorants. I would almost never find the thing that I'm looking unless I add a very specific term. I assume that's fair enough since this is what most people are looking for.   Logged in Google used to give me the same results, but with time it started to give me more and more relevant results. After heavy usage I can happily report that I no longer get any beauty salon in page 1 of almost any Spray related query :) Now, I should just make sure I don't get laid off and need to change my job to a hair stylist :)"

CGPGrey,2zahmn,McTitan,17,Mon Mar 16 23:45:49 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised there's not more comments on the Mars mission.  I'm personally 100% in favor of having only an unmanned program for the foreseeable future, until we invent something like a space elevator or other alternative propulsion system. NASA put the marginal cost of a single space shuttle flight at $410 million in 1993 dollars not counting development http://www.gao.gov/products/NSIAD-93-115 (or $44 million saved for canceling a single flight).    [For another perspective, XKCD's money chart (xkcd.com/980) put the total cost of the program at $190 billion and there were 135 missions.]  The Mars Exploration Rover cost initially $820 million (in 2003 dollars), plus $120 million for the mission extensions.  So by one measure, for the marginal cost of two space shuttle flights, we got two rovers exploring another planet, one for seven years, one for 11 years and counting.  My point is that it's not just that robots are more cost-effective than humans, they're debatably two orders of magnitude more cost effective.  Certainly, you're talking about having dozens of unmanned missions for every manned mission.  And pretty much no matter what we're talking about, I'd rather have dozens of unmanned missions than the photo-op manned mission.  ""But we need a backup for our species!""  As long as it costs over $10K/kg to get into LOE, you're never going to get a colony on another planet with anything more than a few hundred people living in a bunker growing vegetables.  That's no backup for the human race. And why do we need a backup at all?  If it's in case the species is wiped out by a collision event A) we know approximate likelihood of an earth-killer hitting us and it's something like 1 earth killer collision every 100 million years.  That's 20,000 times longer than written history.  It's not going to happen anytime soon.  B)  It makes incomparably more sense to develop ways of tracking objects and then avoiding a collision to spare 7 billion people rather than saving even a colony of 1 million people while the other 7 billion die.  We could better achieve the goal of tracking near-earth objects and developing ways to avoid a collision by developing the unmanned program (with space telescopes and tests of plans to prevent collisions) than by sending a manned colony somewhere.  If we do want a colony, we need to make one of NASA's (and the other space agencies') primary missions reducing the cost of propulsion.  Maybe that means solar sails, maybe that means a space elevator, who knows.  Some engineer will think of something better than chemical rockets eventually.  Until then, launching people to another world is a waste of resources that should be going into developing a cheaper way of getting us there.  So my proposal: cancel all plans for a manned programs until we develop better propulsion.  Devote all the resources that currently go to manned programs into researching space with unmanned missions while developing exotic and new propulsion systems.    (as to the ""Why not both?"" comment: NASA's budget will always be limited and manned missions will always be wasting huge amounts of resources if they're happening.  There's no way to safely do manned flight without expending tens of billions of dollars.  Better to devote the money to the real science.)"
CGPGrey,2zahmn,LupusMechanicus,4,Tue Mar 17 04:09:09 2015 UTC,"Remember, this is not just about science or colonization. This is mainly about accomplishing an incredible feat just for the heck of it. Just like it was not nessesairy at all to put a man on the moon. We did it because we could and I think we should do the same with Mars.   As for the science: just imagine what we discover by trying. We are not going to learn anything by not trying."
CGPGrey,2zahmn,CoboltC,3,Tue Mar 17 18:40:02 2015 UTC,"""As for the science: just imagine what we discover by trying. We are not going to learn anything by not trying.""  We'll learn a lot more by trying with unmanned missions, which I am 100% in favor of (see above) and R&D into new propulsion systems (which I'm also 100% in favor of, again, read my post).  Unmanned missions give you incomparably more science for your buck and there's lots and lots of earthbound applications for advanced robotics.  Whereas by sending people, you're spending a huge amount of money on rocket fuel for the weight of the life support system.  That's where 90% of the cost of a manned mission goes.  All that money is being burned up that could go into better robotics or more challenging unmanned missions.  EDIT: As to the ""it's something difficult so why not do it?"" argument, to paraphrase XKCD:  JFK said, ""We go to the moon not because it is easy, but because it is hard.""  That's also an argument for blowing up the moon.  Or cloning dinosaurs and sending them to the moon.    A colony at the bottom of a deep ocean trench would be hard; digging to the Earth's mantle would be hard; that doesn't mean we should do those things.  You need a positive argument for spending hundreds of billions of dollars in limited scientific resources on the manned space program.  you can't just say, ""Eh why not?"""
CGPGrey,2zahmn,orangeflameyphoenix,3,Tue Mar 17 22:11:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, buck for buck sending people up there is not the best choice.

CGPGrey,2z93nk,mr_enthusiasm,39,Mon Mar 16 17:59:38 2015 UTC,Just tried out the RSS feed with my android podcast app of choice (podcast addict) and everything worked great! Thanks for giving us options!

CGPGrey,2z93nk,Paremo,21,Mon Mar 16 19:10:20 2015 UTC,"I dont think it merits a video because it is not really a thing in itself, its a protocol - a medium if you like. Like paper. But you cant really explain paper you have to see it work, partly because you can do all sorts of stuff with rss: If you have some sort of rss reader1 you can enjoy content like this. Its every submission that /u/bytewave has ever done and it will include any he adds in the future.2 If you use any software besides iTunes for podcasting3 it will rely on rss to find out when there is a new podcast in a series you subscribed too. Some of them will hide the rss under an interface that is basically a list of popular feeds, others just eat the links you will usually find on a webpage4 A more niche apliccation is used by my school.5 If classes are dropped/moved to another room or a substitute teacher is brought in this can primarily be seen on a monitor in the school itself, but we can also check it out on the school's website or - you guessed it - can subscribe to an rss feed.  1 Thunderbird will do nicely and so will many other email clients i assume. Your browser probably has some limited functionality too. 2 In this case amusing stories from his life as unionized tech support senior staff at a major telco in Canada. 3 For example any of those apps Grey keeps pushing6 , or the foobar2000 plugin podcatcher. 4 Example. Notice the gray buttons in the lower right, one of whom is itunes and the other is rss. 5 Did you really think I'd link my school on reddit? 6 Unlike me, I am totally not pushing anything with these examples. Thunderbird is great."

CGPGrey,2z93nk,Toad_Rider,9,Mon Mar 16 21:49:09 2015 UTC,Hell of a compliment.  Accidentally read my own comment in Brady's voice as I wrote it.
CGPGrey,2z93nk,czerilla,3,Mon Mar 16 22:37:37 2015 UTC,"To add to that: RSS isn't just for podcasts. It's also what is under the hood of all feed readers, like the late Google Reader, or currently Feedly among others. Those feed readers help you aggregate the feeds of several news sites, blogs and/or web comics and many more, in one place to see what new content (e.g. articles) appeared without going to every page by hand. It's essentially helps you to manage a subscription to the content of a site, whatever the content may be."
CGPGrey,2z93nk,Kwpolska,6,Mon Mar 16 23:50:14 2015 UTC,It looks like I am not qualified to call myself a RSS person.  I’m staying with skip-inbox YouTube e-mails.

CGPGrey,2z93nk,szErnzEit,11,Mon Mar 16 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"No, ""everybody"" just facebooks. Some people Reddit.  The trouble with both is you cannot really guarantee you see everything from your favorite producers, and youtube is stepping in that direction now, too.  With RSS, unless you just haven't refreshed your feed since the last time they posted 10 things, you will see every thing from your favorite producers.  I use it for my favorite blags and webcomics already presently. /)^3^(\"
CGPGrey,2z93nk,BeyondBull,3,Mon Mar 16 18:36:46 2015 UTC,"I don't really use facebook, except for the messenger. Sometimes I find some interesting news on Reddit. However it doesn't feel very convenient to read news and blogs this way. RSS takes a bit of time to set up with all the news, bogs, articles etc, but it's like you said: you'll never miss something, even when you check it only two or three times a week."

CGPGrey,2z93nk,jacques_ammeur,24,Mon Mar 16 20:34:18 2015 UTC,"sigh here it comes again. Folders are not a replacement for what  a music database like iTunes (and Amarok and a few other tools) are doing. If you wanted the same search options you'd need tons of softlinks in different folders, which gets really unwieldy really quickly. So you probably have a artist/album/title structure, right? What about playlists? Genres? Compilations? By year? Ratings? With a music database like iTunes, it's incredibly easy to create a playlist like ""My highest rated music of 2014"" on the fly. What's unfortunate is how much these features have been de-emphasised over the years, so many users wouldn't even think of doing that - but the features are still there."

The RSS and iTunes feed are a means of preserving those videos in case YouTube does something terrible like delete Grey's channel because he doesn't sign some deal, and Patreon and direct advertisements means he can still get revenue without solely relying on YouTube's system. When big companies have no competition, it can be really scary when they start making changes that no longer reflect your interest, so its prudent to seek out alternatives now, even if they are currently worse, so that when the changes really do cause irreversible harm, you aren't left with nothing."

It's really more an issue of lost revenue from not being on YouTube with YouTube ads forever. In a weird way the more popular the RSS gets the more it 'costs' in terms of lost revenue.

You, Brady, Hank, Derek and others make such great videos, but the only way to view them is to stream it over the Internet. In a developing country like mine, it's extremely costly (and slow) to stream these videos every time I want to share it in a class. I end up using shady YouTube video downloading apps to save your videos for offline viewing. But I would feel much better if there was a legal way of downloading your videos."

Whenever you post something with formatting in reddit, you are using a form of Markdown. It gives the user more control over how his or her document looks.

There are programs that convert your markdown to HTML, Word Document, PDF or, ironically, the Reddit comment field!

Learn to revise. Learn when to stop revising.   It's very interesting to me how various writers can go through this end up with extremely different writing processes. Some of that is just differences in genre/length (epic fantasy writers obviously can't iterate a 300,000 word novel 50 times like you can a 5 minute script), but people who do similar work can wind up with extremely different work habits and still all be productive."

As a student, and as a person who elicits some joy in writing as a form of expressing complex thoughts this is also incredibly helpful. One person's processes won't necessarily work the same for anyone else, but trying to approach things in different ways often captures meaningful results in my own life. That being said I may actually try some of these processes and see if it works out for me with years of College-level writing ahead of me.

Both sides have even lost sight of the original reason the other side had to argue in the first place (if they ever had sight of it).  I have a side, but my reasons don't matter to the other side because to them I'm a copy of the totem that blindly hates for no reason, not a human being with complex motivations, some of which they'd even agree with if they let themselves.

The ""isolated Internets"" explanation in the latter portion of the video really hits home on how (most evidently to us) people act on specific subreddits; so many subs, especially if they are indeed of the ""made by hate, made for hate"" variety just become closed-off breeding grounds for regurgitating and reproducing ""hate idea germs"" that just go on and on and on and on in a vicious and ultimately unproductive and futile cycle."
CGPGrey,2yjs25,Law0308,65,Tue Mar 10 12:09:21 2015 UTC,A great example of the isolated internets is getting an email from a relative on the opposite side of the political spectrum from you that describes your supposed beliefs.

Ideas are good to share (no this-fits-perfectly-'irony' intended) and your format is entertaining, honest, informative, easy to understand, and straight to the point.  Sometimes I wonder if a second channel to put all the videos and half-made ideas that don't make the final cut would be worthwhile to you. Receiving criticism isn't fun, especially when you already know what's wrong, but people like me still enjoy the process, seeing what could have been is a good exercise, and I'm ever curious about the ideas you considered to teach people."

He replied back, ""It would take me two months to prepare that  speech."" This wouldn't work for the school since the festival was only a month away and they replied back ""When could you come for  just a half-hour speech?"" The scientist came back saying ""it would take me three months to prepare the speech.""

I've been struggling to articulate that in a non-offensive way and I think this video does it. It's difficult in the midst of an argument to throw around allegations of ad hominem and strawman attacks. It basically always only make things worse, even when people seem aware of cognitive bias in the abstract. I think this video delivers a more mechanistic and less immediately repulsive (eg What? I'm not biased!) argument that this happens all the time, that it unavoidably happens to you, and needs to be accounted for."

CGPGrey,2xnv7u,chriski1971,127,Mon Mar 2 12:54:22 2015 UTC,Grey thinks we should enter this one for an award and iTunes should add an extra star to its rating system just for episode 32.
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,vmax77,85,Mon Mar 2 13:04:17 2015 UTC,"I do not.  I think this is one of our worst episodes, actually."
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,oenavia,145,Mon Mar 2 13:06:55 2015 UTC,"""Podcasting perfection"" is what you told me?!"
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,samuelng,99,Mon Mar 2 13:08:24 2015 UTC,No.
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,zhegames,12,Mon Mar 2 13:09:02 2015 UTC,"It was almost perfect, the only thing missing was a cliffhanger for the next episode."
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,TewsMtl,19,Wed Mar 4 17:31:01 2015 UTC,I loved that discussion of youtube as much as your discussion of apple products. You even managed to slip some apple product talk into it.
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,zombiepiratefrspace,9,Mon Mar 2 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"I use YouTube's iOS app a lot. And you know one thing that annoys me about it is that it will NOT LIST ALL THE VIDEOS ON A CHANNEL. There is an undefined upper limit, which there is no way to know exists until you follow a channel that you KNOW has an episode you haven't seen on the list, and is from before the oldest video you see. You can find it through search, sometimes the awful sidebar algorithm suggests it. And if a playlist has been made that would have it, you can sometimes find it there. Just infuriating."
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,WhenisHL3,13,Mon Mar 2 17:43:25 2015 UTC,Speaking about extra stars: Did you know that Spinal Tap has a rating of 8 / 11 on IMBD?
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,zombiepiratefrspace,32,Mon Mar 2 20:15:29 2015 UTC,Perfect.
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,hob196,12,Mon Mar 2 13:01:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, I thought the main topic was interesting. I was expecting that they would be talking about creators half-assing, so once I realized that wasn't what it was about it was like I had no expectations. I thought it was pretty interesting too, I think the audience of Hello Internet as a whole is probably interested in these kinds of things (another example being all the Amazon talk). So I wouldn't mind hearing more of it!"

CGPGrey,2xnv7u,iMini,21,Mon Mar 2 13:21:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly, because travel at (or rather above) the speed of light only allows you to travel back in time, and who'd want that?  What people really want is to travel to the future, when we'll have HL3."

CGPGrey,2xnv7u,MissRainbowtie,78,Mon Mar 2 12:49:15 2015 UTC,"Just a quick note to Grey and Brady on the YouTube commentary. I for one really enjoy that kind of behind the scenes discussion. So don't feel like you're boring us, because you're not."
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,MissRainbowtie,23,Mon Mar 2 21:25:39 2015 UTC,"I agree, hearing about this stuff is interesting to me. It does tell me, though, that we badly need a youtube competitor. As soon as a viable option comes up I'll try to switch to that as much as possible (assuming it's not facebook, I don't like facebook...)  I noticed the same thing from my viewer experience. Youtube, in general, has gotten more annoying to use over time as opposed to getting better. I don't understand why that's a thing at all. It's like they don't really want me to use the site."
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,Agentz101,6,Tue Mar 3 14:58:28 2015 UTC,"Its really hard to be a video competitor, look at Vimeo for example, it's a big competitor, but I wouldn't have thought that even 1% of video content is seen on there."
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,elias2718,6,Tue Mar 3 15:15:36 2015 UTC,"Vimeo is not a direct competitor, as grey mentioned it has a very different business model. Vimeo might be a viable option if you have a large amount of followers and a few good sponsors (good luck getting them to the new site, though) but since you have to pay to upload you can't use it to start a video series easily and cheaply.  That's not to say you're not right, though. Youtube has an impressive infrastructure and even with that we still regularly complain about buffering issues; a competitor would have to build that up and that's no easy feat. But I would probably take the buffering issues an move over to a different site if I could, if only to push youtube to make some changes for the better."
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,Zartonk,5,Tue Mar 3 15:54:03 2015 UTC,"Agree! I'm always really confused when they discuss about worrying the listeners being bored by the content. I love everything they talk about, regardless how boring the topics are perceived."

CGPGrey,2xnv7u,JeffDujon,28,Mon Mar 2 20:39:39 2015 UTC,You know something is out of date when Brady can make fun of how silly it would be for him to use it.
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,JustTheTip85,4,Tue Mar 3 03:00:22 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing, at first I didn't get what he was saying (I was sleepy) but I did so on a bus, so people don't think I'm crazy at all :/"
CGPGrey,2xnv7u,IndecisiveAsMeh,53,Mon Mar 2 23:42:41 2015 UTC,"The existence of the McDonald's secret menu entirely depends on local trends.  You can order a Mc10:35, but more than likely nobody will know what you're talking about. They'll make it if you tell them the constituent parts though.  As to the McGangbang, I would say this is the most commonly known 'secret item'. If you ordered this, there's a decent chance you'd actually get it. The risk, obviously being, that if they haven't heard of it, you just asked for a McGangbang.  SOURCE: Worked at McDonald's, have ordered McGangbangs by name at McDonald's and received them."

I walked into my homeroom and realised I was the only one there. My teacher just looked at me and said very angrily ""why did you have to come?! If no one showed up I could just go home too. >:O"" So I turned around and walked out. It was that moment I realised teachers were human too."

I was able to order an Egg McMuffin and a McDouble and assemble one myself.   The Mc 10:35  The resulting burger was not great, but it was also not horrible. The burger flavor overpowered the egg and ham,and it had way to much cheese. Other then that, it was alright."

CGPGrey,2xnv7u,erialc21,15,Mon Mar 2 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"I work at McDonald's, and the entire ""secret menu"" is almost entirely unknown by the employees. Order a McGangbang and we'll look at you like a moron.   That said, you can get everything on Hack the Menu easily by describing it. While some places might charge a bit more, HtM almost always had ridiculous ways to get the items. For instance, they tell you to order a McKinley Mac by getting a Big Mac and adding two 1/4 pound patties. This is spending about 30% more than needed. Instead, order a Double Quarter Pounder and tell them to ""make it like a Big Mac and substitute a Big Mac bun""  and you'll get the same thing for way less (and an extra piece of cheese) .   As far as the Mc 10:35, I wouldn't recommend getting it, even if it's possible. Breakfast usually dies around 10, and we hold the old food in the cabinet, as it doesn't make sense to make more for 30 minutes. This food is then held until about 11, when it's thrown away. At any point in this time, you could order a 10:35, but we very commonly won't have the ingredients needed (round eggs go fast) . Even if we do, however, they're going to be nasty old and dry eggs that won't taste so great.   If you want some awesome lunch, though, come in at 10:30. Everything's fresh then."

If you order a 10:35 by saying ""an egg Mcmuffin and a 10:1 patty (1/10th of a pound)  added, it'll be the Mcmuffin plus the ala-carte patty (69 cents) .   If you order a muffin and McDouble, then have them combine them, it'll be simply those two items, maybe with an ""ask me"" tag."

They actually had an automated playlist that contains all your videos. When you open a video from the channel page, you'd be a on a play list of all videos.   Problem is, it was in reverse chronological order, and you could not change that. So instead of watching all the parts that were probably uploaded one after the other, you had to sit there and constantly catch it so it won't take you to the previous video. I even knew YouTubers who would post multi-part things in reverse order.  They added a feature like that, and made it completely pointless."

When I'm listening to a podcast or more importantly to an audiobook in English, I can't really concentrate on something else, because I'm translating it in my mind.

CGPGrey,2w2bn8,Nabokovian97,28,Mon Feb 16 15:09:00 2015 UTC,I feel that I don't translate anymore and just listen. Maybe that's not true but it feels like it has become easier over time and while listening to more podcasts/books and watching english shows and movies.  Then again I have no problem listening to french since I wouldn't understand a word.

As a matter of fact, as English becomes the main language of the audio material I consume, I'm beggining to find certain mannerisms and the style of my local radio annoying (loud, Italian-infused Argentinian Spanish).  You being French (or Canadian, or Belgian), I wonder if something similar happens to you."

Brady can't do anything to help Grey in the situation so what's the point in telling him? Like unless Grey is physically debilitated and requires special help. I... I don't know. i just don't see the point. I imagine he waited until his wife to come home to tell her because again, she can't really do anything about it from work so what's the point? He doesn't want his wife to worry all day about something he took care of himself.

CGPGrey,2w2bn8,MissRainbowtie,34,Mon Feb 16 15:58:25 2015 UTC,Having done a number of long drives across Australia I think there's really two types of driving. City driving requires constant attention and listening to an engaging podcast could really impair your driving. Cross country driving requires a lot less attention and even talking on the phone could keep you more alert than having nothing but the white lines to focus on.
CGPGrey,2w2bn8,Gerbie3000,26,Mon Feb 16 12:41:22 2015 UTC,So true. I don't like driving in general but there's nothing like traversing an empty interstate highway in a spot like Utah or South Dakota.

Driving cross-country to move to Portland, OR, went through a long stretch of rolling hills and eventually lost all FM signal in the UHaul.  I set the radio to scan, and watched as it spun through the channels never finding one to lock on to.  Fast-forward an hour later, when I've long forgotten that the radio was still in scan mode, and suddenly a booming voice declares ""AND THE LORD CAME DOWN THROUGH THE HEAVENS"".... nearly veered off the road as the first channel to lock on was some church thing."
CGPGrey,2w2bn8,socialavoidist,6,Mon Feb 16 17:07:11 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree. In driving situations that are mind-numbing like long stretches of empty straight highway, anything that will keep the driver mentally engaged is good - music, podcasts, phone calls, conversations with passengers, roll down windows for fresh air, etc. For situations where you periodically/constantly need acute response times, I think podcasts are definitely more detrimental when compared to music.

CGPGrey,2w2bn8,mrswaffle,5,Mon Feb 16 13:52:27 2015 UTC,"It's not the knee itself that makes the knee jump, it's the neural system.   When the nerves on your knee muscles feel the pressure, they sound out that signal to you peripheral nervous system, located in you spinal cord. Once it reaches the spinal cord, a signal is sent trough a motor nerve (nerves responsible for movement) all the way back down to you knee muscles, to move the knee.  (It's fun to note than involuntary reflexes don't actually include your brain at all! Just your spinal cord.)  So since this reflex includes all the nerves between your knee and your spine, it's a good test for whether a major part of your nervous system is working as it should."

Dismissing it as totally useless because it doesn't cure one of the perception of pain after what sounds like a relatively small/moderate amount of practice is perhaps a little hasty. It sounds a bit like if I were to complain that tennis classes are useless because I can't score a point against Federer.  With that said, sure, maybe it's not for everyone; and I wish I practiced more than I do, but i've personally found it useful in similar situation's as Grey's burn story."

CGPGrey,2w2bn8,aceROB,8,Tue Feb 17 19:37:26 2015 UTC,I like to add to your post that it has scientific research to back it up. It is not just some new age thing.
CGPGrey,2w2bn8,ZettaGale,15,Mon Feb 16 15:39:16 2015 UTC,Could you guy talk about metric vs imperial system? I'm particularly interested in hearing about why Grey prefers Fahrenheit over Celsius.
CGPGrey,2w2bn8,AmosParnell,14,Mon Feb 16 19:25:53 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for Grey, but here is my reason for preferring Fahrenheit. Celsius often gets lumped together with the rest of the metric system, but it isn't really the same. It isn't even a part of SI. The advantage of metric is the subunits are easier to work with, but neither temperature system actually has any subunits. So Celsius just ends up being a pointless new system with none of the metric advantages.    Edit: Wow, I've just realized that Grey's point about arguments becoming their extremes is very true.  I seem to be becoming an ardent Fahrenheit warrior, when really thats not the case at all."
CGPGrey,2w2bn8,Molwek,6,Tue Feb 17 02:24:21 2015 UTC,"It seems like the responses boil down to ""Did I grow up learning it? If yes then it's the bestest, if no then it's not intuitive/dumb/pointless"""
CGPGrey,2w2bn8,gigikobus,3,Tue Feb 17 14:11:37 2015 UTC,"I think it's because it's a more human scale. 0°F and 100°F are ""very cold"" and ""very hot"" (subjective I know) whereas 0°C and 100°C are ""pretty cold"" and ""dead"".   I prefer celsius mainly because it's modern definition is nicer but hey, I see the logic."

CGPGrey,2w2bn8,pulsetsar,6,Mon Feb 16 17:09:55 2015 UTC,Grey has spoken in previous episodes that Sociology is much better (in his mind) than Psychology because predicting the behaviour of populations is more accurate than trying to predict the behaviour of an individual.
CGPGrey,2w2bn8,googolplexbyte,23,Mon Feb 16 21:21:43 2015 UTC,I very much enjoy the social protocol admonitions Brady just rains down on Grey after the burn story. It makes me feel very aware of their friendship and dynamic.

Resistentialism: ""the seemingly spiteful behavior manifested by inanimate objects""  EDIT (added): On the rage. My brother was telling me about a sport psychologist, who gave a lecture on the monkey brain: our base instincts and reactions. He explained these kick in much faster than your rational brain. He showed the clip of a guy trying to print-screen and getting sprayed with toner by the printer. His monkey brain was attacked and had to retaliate.  The link at the bottom of Resistentialism to Animism is interesting. It's quite ingrained in us to think of all things as having a will of their own. Even our intuitive physics is based on agonist and antagonist, things being impeded or assisted in their goal. (or at least according to Steven Pinker)"

CGPGrey,2vja9g,mikeyReiach,4,Thu Feb 12 04:11:57 2015 UTC,"I use up all my data every month as is. Can't use the cell to also listen to podcasts. Plus, what I like about iTunes is that my podcasts are more like a playlist and I don't have to search for any of them."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,DeathHaze420,2,Wed Feb 11 20:21:25 2015 UTC,"I have my podcast app (BeyondPod on Android) automatically update and download new episodes at 6am every day.  This way I have the most recent episode or two of every podcast and I can almost 100% guarantee they'll be grabbed on wifi (because why the hell would I not be alseep at 6am, except the times when I'm not, which is often...but I'm at least home).  I think this feature is one of their premium features, but I'd say it along with some of the others is well worth the...$2, I think?"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Tom2Die,6,Wed Feb 11 21:26:52 2015 UTC,"Specifically referring to this video, but yeah - virtually all podcast-listening applications have some form of progress bar for audio playback."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Data_Error,6,Wed Feb 11 16:15:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, mine does too. I just can't whip out the iPod every time I think the podcast is done. Damn you grey.  Usually I just wait til the last podcast starts to switch to another pod."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,DeathHaze420,3,Wed Feb 11 16:19:50 2015 UTC,The app I use (probably not for long) has a progress bar but HI podcasts frequently show negative time remaining.  If I stopped it on 0:00 there's a good chance I'd miss the end bits.

CGPGrey,2vja9g,cup_of_sup,3,Wed Feb 11 16:48:34 2015 UTC,"Very similar for me - queue it up on iTunes, minimize the window and don't look again 'till I think it's over. HI is particularly notable for non-indicative endings, so I end up checking those specifically."

This is a very very important comment that should be highlighted.  youtube (google), facebook all have a huge control over self-produced content.  It's probably impossible, but I find myself fantasizing about a sort of Internet ""Co-Op"" type of website to replace FB and YT, where we own and control our own content, and the majority of whatever revenue goes to the owner, and only a modest amount goes to the non-profit co-op to maintain the site.     sigh."

For instance, I don't know if you're familiar at all with the video-game/Let's player scene on youtube, but I was once on the Game Grumps subreddit, and someone mentioned he started receiving notifications on his phone when they post a new video. Tons of people replied, and within a short amount of time we basically had a list of a couple youtubers from this ""scene"" who suddenly all started appearing in (presumably android only?) phone notifications.  I didn't hang around long enough to see if they figured out the reason though."

CGPGrey,2vja9g,kylestarkey1,54,Wed Feb 11 16:44:49 2015 UTC,I just use an RSS feed for all important youtube channels. Works like a charm.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,96fps,82,Wed Feb 11 14:05:31 2015 UTC,Works for as long as YouTube keeps RSS support.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,janw_oostendorp,23,Wed Feb 11 14:06:36 2015 UTC,A lot of the big media companies don't really like RSS. Google killed reader. Twitter killed or at least has hidden the feeds. YT rss also has hidden the feeds. PS grey's YT feed
CGPGrey,2vja9g,a_guile,7,Wed Feb 11 14:27:48 2015 UTC,I think it was because they weren't adapted by users as much as they hoped.  I have turned beyond pod app (podcast app on Android) into my rss for blogs. I just  have a category for blogs and now I'm creating one for youtube.   Thanks for the link
CGPGrey,2vja9g,suppow,9,Wed Feb 11 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"My other theory is that with RSS they have no (or minimal) control over what you get to see, unlike what Facebook or YouTube are doing.  RSS has no 3rd party who gets to profit."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Zugam,6,Wed Feb 11 19:17:00 2015 UTC,I agree RSS is a bit nerdy and most people don't know what it is. I use selfoss as a self hosted solution. Really like it.

CGPGrey,2vja9g,Taz-zik,2,Mon Feb 16 08:22:45 2015 UTC,Never understood why RSS wasn't more widely adopted. Once you have a good reader it save so much time and for most readers all you have to do is copy in the web address to find the feed.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,timeawesomemaker,3,Thu Feb 12 08:50:55 2015 UTC,I find This one updates a little faster.

CGPGrey,2vja9g,some-freak,5,Wed Feb 11 23:39:59 2015 UTC,Is the RSS feed for your blog (cgpgrey.com) all of the same content as the emails?
CGPGrey,2vja9g,YukiaN,6,Wed Feb 11 17:11:19 2015 UTC,This is the ticket right here. Use your own RSS/Atom from your own domain to announce videos. This way you are not tied to YT and can upload to all video sites simultaneously.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Hoot_Hoot_Hootenanny,4,Thu Feb 12 06:02:56 2015 UTC,"well the Idea behind Email is to make us independent and i like it, we shouldn't be so reliant on youtube for these types of things. Sadly i only found out about your new Video through this subreddit. It wouldn't even show up on my youtube feed -.-"

CGPGrey,2vja9g,elFarto,2,Wed Feb 11 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"Is there a reason that your website (and its feed) are so slow to update? The One Ring video didn't seem to get posted to your site until the next day.  Also, RSS is squidgey; ATOM is superior."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Nigholith,4,Wed Feb 11 21:24:59 2015 UTC,"Current RSS support is only via the old deprecated v2 API, which is due to be shut down in the next couple of months, and the v3 API doesn't support RSS :(  https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/deprecation_faq#rss"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,vmax77,2,Wed Feb 11 19:40:38 2015 UTC,What reader do you use? I am currently using feedly but I don't want to pay a subscription to use features like searching. I'd be more than happy to make a one off payment to something though.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Zagorath,3,Wed Feb 11 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"I use ""Slick RSS"" for Chrome. Don't know how it compares to the others but its better than nothing."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,tilozi,3,Wed Feb 11 15:20:30 2015 UTC,I've been using theoldreader.com. It was built as a replacement for Google Reader.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,slottmachine,1 point,Wed Feb 11 15:48:40 2015 UTC,"TT-RSS, which requires some smarts to set up, but does everything Feedly does and more; plus it's open-source."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Gcrein,29,Wed Feb 11 16:23:19 2015 UTC,Grey's email list works - sometimes even pre-screen ! So I am going to go ahead and recommend. And when did Grey start saying Goodbyes? I thought the abrupt end was the signature move!
CGPGrey,2vja9g,slottmachine,21,Wed Feb 11 14:12:07 2015 UTC,"I really just don't get it. I've heard so many people talking about how subscriptions are a problem and don't work correctly. Things like subscription videos just not appearing, as well as more recently this Facebook-like algorithm thing.  But I've personally never had a problem with it.  As far as I'm aware, I've never missed a video from a channel I subscribe to. Still, the sheer number of people complaining about it, it's impossible not to believe them all. So I'm sure it's a real problem, but for whatever reason, I've never experienced it.    But yeah, I just don't want my email clogged up. It's already too busy with mail lists and stuff. I'm happy to rely on this subreddit (which I have IFTTT getting every post to as a notification on my phone). That, plus YT's subscriptions, plus an RSS subscription to your blog, seem to do fine for me."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,pigsnoutman,28,Wed Feb 11 14:23:54 2015 UTC,"I'm in the same boat. In my 8 years of watching Youtube videos, I've never had videos not show up for me in my subscription feed. At least, to the point that it is noticeable/annoying.  Nowadays, I just have 'https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions' as my bookmark for Youtube, and that feed works very well for me.  Maybe it has something to do with the number of subscriptions? I've never had this problem at ~200 subscriptions."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,OSkorzeny,20,Wed Feb 11 14:52:46 2015 UTC,"Actually, I'm pretty sure the vast majority of people never go to that URL, or at least that's what Grey seemed to think in the podcast. Apparently most people will never deviate from the default when using an application, which is something I will never understand no matter how hard I try to empathize, and that includes pressing the ""My Subscriptions"" button on youtube. This means that they're relying on the youtube home page and the garbage emails that youtube sends, which I can assure you do not notify you of every video.  I too use the subscriptions feed as my bookmark, and I agree, none of these problems exist if you do that. That said, some people don't want to check youtube every 10 seconds like I do. I admit, life would be better if I just had everything sent right to me when content creators finished their glorious gifts to the world so that I wouldn't be constantly skinner-boxing the refresh button on every website I use."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,spaceXcadet,14,Wed Feb 11 15:25:01 2015 UTC,"I'm glad to find someone else with this opinion. I thought I was going crazy here. The ""My Subscriptions"" feed is so simple. You subscribe to a channel and you get to see every video that channel uploads. If it was your first time browsing the YouTube homepage that'd take like 3 minutes to figure out."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,slottmachine,6,Wed Feb 11 16:13:54 2015 UTC,"Like it or not, I think you and I are a part of a tiny subgroup that is willing to spend those 3 minutes.  I don't know if it's because people don't think there's anything to gain from exploring or what, but like I said, I'm never going to understand this."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,faceplanted,3,Wed Feb 11 19:54:07 2015 UTC,"Most people don't know why they would want to take those 3 minutes. The way I found out was by listening to 20 hours of hello internet podcasts. Plus youtube homepage has some benefits, it filters out some less important subs moderately well, and very occationally suggests good videos."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,NeverrSummer,5,Thu Feb 12 04:01:08 2015 UTC,"Most people don't subscribe to YouTube channels at all. I don't know anyone else who actually uses their YouTube account to follow certain creators. They just hear about a channel, binge watch everything, then move on with their life."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Zagorath,3,Thu Feb 12 04:48:21 2015 UTC,"I've had it where videos don't show you on my 'My Subscriptions' page, and I only realize when I see them the next day on in my recommended videos section on the front page."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Neosovereign,2,Wed Feb 11 17:39:31 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's awful. Did it then appear in the page later? I'm going to have to obsessively check every channel now."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,NeverrSummer,3,Wed Feb 11 19:48:56 2015 UTC,"Nowadays, I just have 'https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions' as my bookmark for Youtube, and that feed works very well for me.   I went one step further and have that url be the first thing predicted if I start typing youtube in the address bar, while still maintaining the ability to press tab after the letter 'y' and have the bar search youtube with my query for me."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,flowers_are_pretty,2,Wed Feb 11 17:37:39 2015 UTC,"I've noticed some videos not showing up on the feed/subscriptions list, I have to manually go to the YouTuber's own page to find it.  Specifically, I can't find Grey's most recent Lord of the Rings video anywhere my subscriptions page at all."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,flowers_are_pretty,4,Thu Feb 12 05:42:23 2015 UTC,"Every time this topic comes up I feel like I'm going insane.  As far as I know I've never once had this problem in the years that I've been using YouTube daily.   It's so much simpler to just use the My Subscriptions page than to subscribe to an email list, but I guess it's easier to convince some people to try emails than to change their browsing habits.  This entire problem dissapears if you take 10 seconds to reassign your YouTube bookmark.  I'm just amazed so few people know about it and a little disappointed that Grey never mentions it."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Enjoys-The-Rain,4,Thu Feb 12 08:02:50 2015 UTC,"I believe the problem is that many people are claiming that even on the My Subscriptions page, YouTube sometimes doesn't show you all your subscriptions."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,KingJaredoftheLand,3,Thu Feb 12 08:58:09 2015 UTC,"I only have a problem with the my subscriptions page (which I do use) if someone uploads/releases multiple videos at once. So if they release part 1, 2, and 3, I'll only see part 1 usually, but its pretty simple to find the other parts."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Enjoys-The-Rain,3,Wed Feb 11 22:40:27 2015 UTC,"Really?  I've never had that. Mine will sometimes get the timing a little weird and I'll see the parts in the wrong order, but never just missing. That's weird."

CGPGrey,2vja9g,Mr_Xing,19,Wed Feb 11 14:00:08 2015 UTC,Sadly not.  I busted this video out between all my regular work last night and this morning because of something I heard.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,ignamv,12,Wed Feb 11 14:03:12 2015 UTC,"That does not bode well (the whatever you heard, which i would assume is something you cannot tell the rest of us)"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Bilgistic,4,Wed Feb 11 14:05:10 2015 UTC,"I agree with that.  If YouTube has given him some inside information on when things are changing, I am worried about the magnitude of their changes."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,tilozi,3,Wed Feb 11 19:39:30 2015 UTC,What are they changing??
CGPGrey,2vja9g,The_cat_agree,9,Thu Feb 12 05:11:57 2015 UTC,This was a one day production?   Was this your shortest video turn around ever?

CGPGrey,2vja9g,stormkorp,8,Wed Feb 11 19:21:52 2015 UTC,Two videos in two days?   This is the end of times.

CGPGrey,2vja9g,Suppafly,9,Thu Feb 12 00:11:54 2015 UTC,This complaint is incredibly common yet in the last eight years or so I've never had this issue.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Suppafly,3,Wed Feb 11 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"Same here, maybe we're just the chosen ones? How many people are you subscribed to? Maybe it depends on that number."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,jwaldrep,3,Wed Feb 11 14:55:05 2015 UTC,I'm not him but I got 23 subscriptions and never had a problem with that. Are people using the My Subscription tab? I putted it as my default Youtube page and never had problems.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,JulitoCG,4,Wed Feb 11 16:28:25 2015 UTC,I've use the My Subscription Tab as well. Never had problems.

CGPGrey,2vja9g,Being_Unreal,12,Wed Feb 11 15:13:06 2015 UTC,I'm on your email list and I didn't get notified about this video. But I did get notified about the last LoTR one.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,JR-Dubs,40,Wed Feb 11 14:24:03 2015 UTC,I'm not planning on pushing this one to the email list -- they're already subscribed.  I really don't want to send people more than they signed up for.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,D33P_Cyphor,11,Wed Feb 11 14:26:41 2015 UTC,That seems reasonable.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,ooloops,2,Wed Feb 11 15:06:00 2015 UTC,That makes so much sense. I was confused as to why I saw this on reddit before I got an email. I was especially surprised because of how recently the last video came out.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Jakyland,5,Wed Feb 11 21:23:49 2015 UTC,"THANK YOU. I'm infuriated by emails asking me to sign up for an email list I've (clearly) already signed up for.   You, sir, are a Gentleman and a Scholar."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,niechcacy,3,Wed Feb 11 19:13:30 2015 UTC,"Logically, that makes total sense.  However, some people presumably signed up for your email list so they can be sure to see ALL of your videos.  I have never had a problem receiving emails from YT for new videos from my subscribed channels (which is how I was notified about this video), but don't you think some of the fans on your email list that do have those problems might like to see this video?  Especially if you plan on discussing it at all on the podcast in the future."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,anschelsc,5,Wed Feb 11 18:37:10 2015 UTC,"Yes Grey, you can enter my inbox anytime you want. Please don't abuse the priviledge :P"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,anschelsc,6,Wed Feb 11 14:42:01 2015 UTC,If email doesn't work you can start handing out flyers.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Mncdk,4,Wed Feb 11 16:08:01 2015 UTC,"Not that I don't trust Grey and Brady, but do they (either to both) intend to share this email list with other ""sponsoring partners"" who may send ""marketing materials we may like"" via this email address?"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Tyjovi,34,Wed Feb 11 18:32:06 2015 UTC,Never.   It's just me running this thing and my relationship with my audience is the most valuable thing I have.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Mulvad4ever,6,Wed Feb 11 18:36:14 2015 UTC,The explanation behind a broken YouTube.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,TFeathersB,10,Thu Feb 12 01:08:09 2015 UTC,"I'm amazed how many people in the comments of the video claim they don't have this problem. I swear I only get every 2nd CGP Grey video which is very frustrating. I also can't figure out why they wouldn't make an option to have every video appear in your 'my subscriptions' page, if people are interested enough in YouTube you change the default settings, they don't need to be limited to the content that seems best suited to them."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,In_Dying_Arms,7,Wed Feb 11 14:13:55 2015 UTC,"It might be interesting to see why there is a difference. For me it is the polar opposite, I get videos on my subscription page from channels that I haven't watched for at least a year."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,waawftutki,4,Wed Feb 11 14:41:13 2015 UTC,"I think I'll still rely on YT and this subreddit. But hey, I'll be one of the first to subscrube if you decide to create an RSS feed one day."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Neosovereign,6,Wed Feb 11 14:05:18 2015 UTC,There already is an RSS feed! It's here. /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels can you confirm that this also will get me all of your videos?
CGPGrey,2vja9g,jwaldrep,8,Wed Feb 11 14:36:19 2015 UTC,Yes… eventually.  Updating the website is last on the checklist.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Tom2Die,3,Wed Feb 11 14:48:32 2015 UTC,Luckily your videos aren't usually super time-sensitive.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,MatthieuG7,4,Wed Feb 11 15:12:02 2015 UTC,"I use subscriptions very consciously. I don't subscribe to anything unless I want to see ALL of the things, so I'm only subscribed to a few dozen channels. As such, I've also stuck with the subscription feed throughout the various layouts YouTube has forced upon us, and was actually surprised of how YouTube have changed when you and Brady recently talked about it. I just hadn't noticed that the thing I was using had become something that was hidden away. I still use the subscription feed. It's the only way to YouTube in my mind."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,cruuzie,4,Wed Feb 11 14:36:43 2015 UTC,"This is somewhat unrelated but I know you're going to read it because this is Reddit and not YouTube. During episode 22 (I believe) of Hello Internet, Brady mentioned Breaking Bad and his admiration of the show and you replied with ""I have watched it, and I do agree that it is good... but I have asterisks on that."" And you proceeded to NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN.  What are the asterisks GREY?!"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,mooglinux,2,Thu Feb 12 02:36:55 2015 UTC,I would also like to hear this discussed.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,intronink,5,Sat Feb 14 20:14:25 2015 UTC,I've never had a problem with missing uploads. The few times I have it's just been my fault for just not seeing it. I'm surprised that it happens so often to others.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,TheBucher,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:17:22 2015 UTC,"Same here, but it is probably because I use some addons/extensions that affect youtube videos and the subscription box. For those wondering"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,mellowfish,7,Wed Feb 11 16:11:43 2015 UTC,"One of you computer wizards out there should code some form of browser add-on that somehow browses your subscriptions for new uploads, and seemingly puts them on a list over youtube's sub box, bypassing youtube's selective algorithms. Think Greasemonkey or something along those lines. In fact that has to be a thing already."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,KingJaredoftheLand,5,Wed Feb 11 14:17:39 2015 UTC,Can you not just look at the my subscriptions page? I use youtube center to change the look to the old format with a grid instead of the huge ugly boxes it has now.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,_I_Have_Opinions_,2,Wed Feb 11 22:38:30 2015 UTC,This would require way more permissions than I am comfortable with.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,CorDra2011,2,Wed Feb 11 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"Well...maybe.  It could probably be done in-browser, kinda like how Reddit Enhancement Suite modifies reddit in-place.  I'm certainly not the guy to do it though, web stuff has never been my area of interest."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,leadnpotatoes,3,Wed Feb 11 21:32:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think youtube will pull the https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions down intentionally, they aren't evil and it would be counter-productive. Hell even Facebook has an option to see the posts as a time line like twitter and not as:""We will choose for you what you see"".  https://www.facebook.com/?sk=h_chr"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Coffee-Fueled-Robot,3,Wed Feb 11 14:16:44 2015 UTC,What new information inspired you to make this video? This email list isn't exactly a new thing. Any upcoming Youtube updates?
CGPGrey,2vja9g,maxblasdel,3,Wed Feb 11 14:34:15 2015 UTC,The email list isn't new -- but I needed to play around with how to make it work before promoting it so directly on YouTube.   (I now have it set up and working so that people can only get exactly what they want)
CGPGrey,2vja9g,MabDarogan,3,Wed Feb 11 14:45:25 2015 UTC,"I very rarely recieve Grey's email before I spot it on YouTube. I do very diligently mash that ""My Subscriptions"" button EVERY SINGLE TIME I go on YouTube, whether via iPad or on desktop. It kindof puzzles me that anyone could mistake ""What To Watch"" as anything remotely like a list of the most recent videos uploaded by the channels you have subscribed to, it is just so clearly not.  But yea, the emails are reliable but seem to be a big sluggish hitting my mailbox."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,BagofSocks,2,Wed Feb 11 14:36:07 2015 UTC,"But yea, the emails are reliable but seem to be a big sluggish hitting my mailbox.   They are distributed randomly over time with some people getting them early so I can make sure things are working right."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,kherven,3,Wed Feb 11 14:46:14 2015 UTC,Ideally I want them immediately when the video or HI podcast goes out.  Being able to participate in the reddit Convo early is a big reason why I subscribe.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,_watching,3,Thu Feb 12 02:52:41 2015 UTC,"My Gmail redirects greys emails directly to ""advertisments folder"". How do I fix this ?"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,excalibr101,3,Wed Feb 11 15:53:57 2015 UTC,Drag the emails to a different folder and it will eventually figure it out. I think you can also send emails to folders on receipt by sender with filters.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,DADP7,3,Wed Feb 11 21:53:38 2015 UTC,"So, I did sign up for the email list, just like you requested.  Guess what, Google Inbox has also gone the way of Facebook and is deciding which emails it thinks I should read.  That's right, I'm only getting some of my emails through my Google Inbox and I have to jump through extra hoops to see all of them.  Even then, there are some that Google, in their infinite wisdom, has determined must be spam and won't let me see them at all, such as emails from my daughter's school teacher, emails from my employer, emails from CGP Grey.  But I get every single forward from people who's emails I've been deleting unread since 1995.﻿"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,ManWithABeard,3,Thu Feb 12 05:13:39 2015 UTC,"I suspect you might be less prioritized with YT's sub feeds due to your much rarer uploads Grey. Not that that should change anything in your process of course, but I wonder if more frequent uploaders would suffer as much."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,hitapole,2,Thu Feb 12 05:15:15 2015 UTC,Kind of ironic that exactly this video didn't show up in my feed...
CGPGrey,2vja9g,SomethingAzn,2,Tue Feb 17 12:20:21 2015 UTC,"It's ok Grey, we forgive you for it taking so long."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,daviddwk,2,Wed Feb 11 14:09:45 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, if Google completely loses their minds and causes a YouTube apocalypse, you can continue to stay in touch with your fans and subscribers through the one of many other vectors."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,cookieaddictions,2,Wed Feb 11 14:43:13 2015 UTC,"The last email from YouTube I got was back in November for ""Quick and Easy Voting for Normal People"".  The past few videos I've found out about via reddit and the email list.  Edit: Correction.  I just received an email from YouTube notifying me of Grey's video.  It was 5 hours after it was posted, but they still notified me."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,FlowingChiaki,2,Wed Feb 11 14:46:09 2015 UTC,"I have signed up for the email list and subscribe on YouTube for Grey's videos. I have mostly stopped relying on YouTube for any notifications. I find that I see most of the videos on Reddit before I get email notifications, either in this subbreddit or the videos subreddit."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Atario,2,Wed Feb 11 15:42:05 2015 UTC,"So I'm a little weird and I actually don't have an active YouTube account, therefore no subscriptions. Even though I'm not logged in YouTube still tracks my viewing pattern, and pretty reliably whenever Grey makes a new video it takes the front slot on my somewhat anonymous home screen. I still use the subreddit to get all my Grey/Brady news."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,nerdythoughts,2,Wed Feb 11 15:57:48 2015 UTC,I don't really like the idea of youtube deciding what I see based on some weird choice they make.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,SomeGoodInThisWorld,2,Wed Feb 11 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"I never really understood why I didn't have this widespread problem, then I realized that I had set http://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions/u as my bookmark for ""Youtube"" a long time ago. So I guess I'd recommend that to anyone who has these issues?"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,SomeGoodInThisWorld,2,Wed Feb 11 17:21:01 2015 UTC,"I gotta say I'm really frustrated with how YouTube treats the subscription system atm. Half of my subscriptions are just straight up never on my front page - in their place are like 3 separate ""recommended for you!"" sections, almost always of content I don't want to watch. It's ridiculous."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,SomeGoodInThisWorld,2,Wed Feb 11 19:56:26 2015 UTC,Been using the email system for about a month now and I find it way better of a way to get notified of new videos or podcasts or posts or whatnot.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Bill_565,2,Wed Feb 11 20:34:46 2015 UTC,This was the most podcast-like video of all
CGPGrey,2vja9g,kylestarkey1,2,Wed Feb 11 20:55:25 2015 UTC,"So your mailing list has become your end-of-the-youtube insurance - good!  I'm subscribed to over a hundred channels, and it sucks. Even when using the ""uploaded videos"" page, it will somewhat randomly select a subset of 50 channels of which the updates are shown. Kind of like reddit (where I'm also subscribed to over 300 subreddits - don't judge me).  So I have created my own system: use several youtube channels. You can do that easily, they are all associated with your user, and you can switch with two clicks, no logout/login/password required. Each one is subscribed to one or two dozen channels, which is a number that seems to work well. I also have a ""master channel"" that is subscribed to everything, so I have a master list, as well as bookmarks for all channels (in case Youtube screws me somehow)."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,zouhair,2,Wed Feb 11 20:57:15 2015 UTC,"Even on my email (gmail) google has decided what I want to see and what I don't.  I signed up to the email list but whenever an email is sent out it goes to my ""promotions"" tab and I don't get a notification.  The same thing happens with  the emails from Brady."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,narbris,2,Wed Feb 11 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, even My Subscriptions stopped updated properly recently, but a slight work around is to scroll to the end of the page and click the load more. Also, there's a link at the top to Manage subscriptions. Make sure to check there to see if it's set to always notify."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,jothamvw,2,Wed Feb 11 22:31:26 2015 UTC,I haven't had this problem using the extension BetterTube. It gets rid of all of the suggestions and shit from the YouTube feed and only shows subscriptions. Email is a solution that gets the job done but I'm not really going to checking it even if I try.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,BoxBopChallenge,2,Thu Feb 12 01:56:39 2015 UTC,I am very satisfied with your email list.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,runedot,2,Thu Feb 12 03:11:21 2015 UTC,"I do recall you mentioning the email list before in Hello Internet, but somehow, this video is the thing that convinced me to sign up."

CGPGrey,2vja9g,mikeyReiach,2,Fri Feb 27 04:58:15 2015 UTC,My Analytic Spreadsheet based on the Brady VS Grey (http://brady-vs-grey.herokuapp.com/) is going great!
CGPGrey,2vja9g,neuromonocle,2,Fri Feb 27 20:33:32 2015 UTC,"Grey mentioned he is animating now, which means he is going to release a new video soon, so I thought I'd share the latest Brady VS Grey Comparison before it gets reset :D Caveman VS Robot"
CGPGrey,2vja9g,vmax77,2,Sun Mar 8 22:01:06 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this has never been a problem for me. Pretty much every channel I'm subscribed to puts out stuff once every week at best. And especially in CGPGrey's case, when time between videos is around a month, there's no way I'll not check out his channel for a whole month to see if a new video is up.  But I guess it's a great idea to keep in touch in case his channel is closed for whatever reason."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,Chmis,3,Mon Mar 9 17:53:51 2015 UTC,"RSS Feed!  I think if Grey was concerned about the YouTube takeover he needs to be pushing his own RSS feed to his website (not YouTube rss). Every video he pushes in the RSS feed would show with a simple embed if that was YouTube or another service.   Half of us are already RSSed to his podcast and will never miss a post. I personally have subscribed to the YouTube rss in my beyond pod app and get notifications of new videos that way. I also do blogs that I want as well.  The problem with Emails is emails list have been abused because once someone has your email is subject to selling it to someone else who will abuse the feed. People are weary of giving out their email for this reason now. We do not need a inbox filled every morning from random people. Now I don’t think Grey will sell our email but many others already have sold my email or have crawled the internet and fill my 100+ emails a day. Grey will easily get lost in this method.  RSS is a feed that is the responsibility of Grey to maintain and if he abuses it its very easy to unsubscribe.   Grey would also own the ""Race Course"". Just like podcast his RSS feed will not be infringed by big bullying companies.  I don’t know why RSS didn’t take off but that is what podcasts on Android are so maybe they did and nobody knows it.   I have subscribed to Greys RSS YouTube in my Podcast app but YouTube is still in control. If grey had us subscribe to his blog and that pushed his embedded videos no one would know if YouTube shut down and Grey switched to Porntube for embedding in his new post(maybe the recommend videos would get a little weird after finishing a video)."

CGPGrey,2vja9g,StrategicSarcasm,2,Wed Feb 11 14:12:14 2015 UTC,"I do this actually. But I think the email list also has an additional benefit of allowing the creator to directly send messages and updates that are non-video related. And who knows, if one day Youtube throws an unacceptable agreement at Grey and he has to abandon ship, he can let us know in email where to find his stuff in the future. But lets hope it doesn't have to come to that."

I would subscribe to your list but I subscribe to this subreddit, to HI, have an RSS for your video uploads and, of course, subscribe on YouTube. You will be hugely overestimating subscribers if I subscribe to your mailing list. So, I'm going to do you a favour and not let you email me."
CGPGrey,2vja9g,sthreet,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:24:37 2015 UTC,I don't think Grey's subscriber estimation depends on how you choose to receive the notification of the videos but would depend on subscribers and views.  But it IS your choice of whether you receive the notification or not.
CGPGrey,2vja9g,grantben08,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:46:16 2015 UTC,"Throughout past 3 years I've been watching YouTube I've had perhaps 2 or 3 videos not appear on my sublist, and it's been a while since it happened. Worst case scenario they take up to half an hour. Still, I'm a bit worried that seeing how many people complain about this problem, I may have missed some videos I'm not aware about."

I started getting them, and there was no way to stop them except on a channel-by-channel basis as the videos came out. There was supposed to be check boxes that you could uncheck, but they already were. Until just a couple of days ago when the boxes started working correctly and I could uncheck them."

There might be a video here or there that I miss but most of my subscriptions have sequential videos or put up videos on certain days and that always happens. I moved to RSS recently too, and every video shows up on both my RSS feed and my Subscriptions feed without fail."

I think there's a setting somewhere else where you can choose if it's sent by email or text message. Then have those email automatically sorted and separated frp the rest in you email service.  I originally set it up so that I can keep track of my backlog when I'm away from my computer/Internet connection. The normal uploads list only contains a certain number of the most recent uploads.  Although it seems to never miss an upload as well far as I'm aware, might be worth a shot for those of you having trouble."

Sometimes I'll get a notification, but I think I remember like three or four of those ever. And the emails they send a front page are just completely random videos.  EDIT: In my opinion, a larger problem is that youtube shows ""top rated"" comments by default with no way to change to newest first, and comments that get a lot of replies get top rated."

CGPGrey,2vauf7,justarandomgeek,14,Mon Feb 9 16:38:37 2015 UTC,"Fellowship of the Ring spoilers below!  I think it's also worth noting that the worlds of many big mythos-es (sp?) Share this model of decreasing fantasticness and powers from the past until now. For context, to borrow from Joeseph CAmpbell:    ""A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous >forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious >adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man.[3]""   in modern stories this 'adventure place' could be seen as Toon Town, or anything outside tatooine, or anything outside hobbiton in the LOTR case. But since the aspects of that place are often referenced in the lore or the past of the 'home village', and since those old tales which survive might be the ones with more bigger, exaggerated stuff, there's a tendency of many mythoses to have a past where things were just generally mightier. The home culture itself is a fallen version of some perfect past, like eden, hesiod's 5 ages of man, etc....the good was gooder but the bad is even baddier. Like Gandalf v. Balrog. Gandalf even says as they enter Moria:   ""* Be on your           guard...there are older and fouler things           than the Orcs in the deep places of the           world.""*   and later when encountering the Balrog:    A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world!           This foe is beyond any of you!               (urgent yell)           Run! Quickly!   Great and mighty ancient things, collossal shadows just beyond the horizon of normal and examinable....why does this matter?  Because if we're going along w Campbell and Jung (who campbell built on) many stories and the characters within are actually symbolic of the internal operations of our own minds. So to look into the past of monstrous fantastical powers, is like looking into our subconscious, or in more modern terms, deep back through time into mammall brain and deeper still under that lizard brain. The great stories of a time fit the psychological needs of the people of that time, and tell a story of how a world was upset and can come to be healed. Tolkein is a perfect example of this in light of the grey metal machine war had turned into during and after world war 1, the collapse of the old world systems, and the inability of old mythos' to properly address this completely changed world.   So, in a way, ya it's 'like' the heat death, but that's coincidental. It's more like with Hesiod how before with the greeks humans were the gods, and before the gods the titans...and the further you go back these entities are less about agency and contemplation, and more about being like forces of nature, and at the earilest, bare elemental aspects. Like the inverse square law, where the further you get from the home village the more you encounter things of ancient times, like looking into space is looking back into time, to look back into time in a story, or to is to look back into the evolutionary history of our own minds. And the story itself is 'equipment for living' to borrow from burke, not just for handy TIL's and come-backs, but as metaphor and reference, and even as a balm for the unconscious.   I'm hoping that makes any sense.    edit: cleaned it up a bit.   edit 2: added spoiler alert"
CGPGrey,2vauf7,Moraken,8,Mon Feb 9 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"True, but seems like modern fantasy - namely The Song of Ice and Fire - is concerned with magic RETURNING to the world, where once it was lost."

It's power is inspiration.  Nenya, the ""Ring of Adamant"" was kept by Galadriel. It's power is protection and preservation.   Vilya, the greatest of the Three, the ""Ring of Air"" was kept by Gil-Galad and given to Elrond. It's powers are never clearly defined, but it's expected that it involves healing (because of Elrond's reputation) and some degree of control over the elements (Elrond's torrent of water that defeated the Nazgul)"

Sauron wasn't able to take physical form for hundreds of years so wouldn't have been able to use the ring anyway.  Once he has a body again, the ring decides it's time to take the fast-track path East on Bilbo."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,HolyMammoth,21,Mon Feb 9 15:17:21 2015 UTC,"It's a situation open to interpretation, but often the Ring leaving Gollum is attributed to the Ring itself, and Bilbo finding the Ring is attributed to Eru Ilúvatar.

CGPGrey,2vauf7,DevilGuy,6,Mon Feb 9 16:01:29 2015 UTC,"Wait so Sauron did have a body during The Hobbit/LotR (its been a while since I read the Hobbit, but I don't remember much discussion of Sauron)? Not just a big eye?   And how did Sauron go about/plan on getting a new body? Grow one with his power? Steal someone else's?"
CGPGrey,2vauf7,bonez656,17,Mon Feb 9 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"The Big Eye was Peter Jackson's interpretation. Mostly convey how powerful and terrible Sauron is. Sauron is never explicitly mentioned in the book at all with the exception of one scene where Merry looks into the Palantir and is questioned by Sauron about the Ring.  By only appearing in the story indirectly through other characters, Sauron power is understood. You do not have to see him explicitly to know that he is behind all the forces that are opposing The Fellowship. This is not something you could get away with in the movies. You have to show the villain in a movie, you cannot just make indirect references to him and expect the audience to understand how powerful and evil he is.  Which comes begs the question as to why Jackson chose not present him has having a body, but instead as this all-seeing eye? Mostly because of the whole thing with the Ring restoring his Power. If he has his body, getting the Ring would not appear to do much accept make him more powerful (which it does). The audience would not understand that he is powerful demi-godlike being, they would just assume he was just a really power and evil man/elf. The eye conveys that a little better, not much though. All it really does is create confusion for those who saw the movies first then read the books after.  Also: Sauron is not mentioned is not mentioned in the books as such but as the Necromancer living in Southern Mirkwood."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,bonez656,21,Mon Feb 9 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"I've never been happy about the One Ring's actual power.  Invisibility seems like such an odd choice, especially for the master ring.  You'd generally consider that a lesser power, right?  It would be nice to be able to sneak around, great for the henchmen, but that's not really a power you want or need in high-level political manoeuvring and control.  I've always theorized that the actual power of the ring is    to move into the same realm the wraiths occupy, and invisibility is just a side-effect.  Or, the ring only turns Hobbits invisible.  It was mentioned somewhere that they are naturally - almost magically - good at hiding, so I figured the ring just augmented that power.  So, the ring augments whatever magic or skill the bearer already possesses.   Does anyone other than a Hobbit ever actually wear the ring and become invisible?  It's been a while since I've read any of the materials, but I don't remember any instances."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,vmax77,24,Mon Feb 9 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"to move into the same realm the wraiths occupy, and invisibility is just a side-effect.    This is the way I look at it.  The ring is just trying to get you found and the invisibility is just incidental."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,lpreams,8,Mon Feb 9 18:06:27 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't turning the bearer invisible to mortals be the best idea though? By turning the bearer invisible it could protect them from ordinary attacks in battle for example,  but it also makes the bearer incredibly obvious to the Ringwraiths and Sauron. I would argue that the invisibility thing is more than just a side effect but more self preservation."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,lpreams,3,Mon Feb 9 18:24:15 2015 UTC,Actually I didn't even think about it being an intentional action of the ring in its effort to be found.  That does make sense.
CGPGrey,2vauf7,The1WhoRingsTheBell,5,Mon Feb 9 18:20:53 2015 UTC,Doesn't Isildur wear the ring and become invisible?
CGPGrey,2vauf7,lpreams,3,Tue Feb 10 01:40:19 2015 UTC,"To my interpretation the ring doesn't simply make you invisible, it amplifies your natural abilities. Thus when sauron wears it he gets increased mind control powers, but when a normal person wears it they get considerably less. It's all but outright stated that none of the great people can carry the ring because it would corrupt them, and that while they might be able to use it to defeat sauron they would also just turn out very much like him in the end."

CGPGrey,2vauf7,znode,16,Mon Feb 9 15:25:12 2015 UTC,Classic compromise.
CGPGrey,2vauf7,aragorn407,4,Mon Feb 9 15:33:47 2015 UTC,Is letting 20000 people preview it really any better than just sending it to all ~33333 subscribers?
CGPGrey,2vauf7,mrwazsx,7,Mon Feb 9 15:32:26 2015 UTC,I do it in stages.  Allowed me to fix something and then text the fix.

CGPGrey,2vauf7,jothamvw,11,Mon Feb 9 14:23:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I watched it first thing this morning and had to keep refreshing for it to become public. Then setup an IFTTT channel to sort me out
CGPGrey,2vauf7,aragorn407,4,Mon Feb 9 14:35:21 2015 UTC,I second the IFTTT for the subreddit posts. It's incredibly helpful.

I don't want to get rid of the tab because it legit sorts some stuff out that I want to get, but don't want to be alerted to as soon as I get it."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,retardcharizard,11,Mon Feb 9 17:21:06 2015 UTC,"It would seem the terminology isn't quite correct here? The lesser rings are not the Rings of Power, I don't think, and the Rings of Power is the terminology used to refer to all 20: the one, three, 7, and 9.  The lesser rings seem to be an unspecified number of rings elves created before the 20, and ended up often in the hands of the lieutenants of the wraiths.   ""The lesser rings were only essays of the craft before it was full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles..."""
CGPGrey,2vauf7,HannasAnarion,19,Mon Feb 9 15:17:10 2015 UTC,"This was not my favourite video and I wanted to rework the script a whole lot more, but it had just been too long since I uploaded something.

The thing I most value most about your videos is their precision. That should not be confused with quantity of detail, or, necessarily, complete lack of errors (the truth is a process, or similar).  Also, I would totally watch an hour long diversion into the history of flour milling. No. Really."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,HannasAnarion,15,Mon Feb 9 18:46:27 2015 UTC,"Also, I would totally watch an hour long diversion into the history of flour milling   That's a pretty obscure reference."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,eloquentboot,3,Mon Feb 9 18:52:35 2015 UTC,That makes sense; and in any case the lesser rings aren't really significant anyway so I can see the decision to use it not as a protected term just to make names more straightforward.

CGPGrey,2vauf7,CgRazor,10,Mon Feb 9 14:48:23 2015 UTC,"Can the next video be about what happens after the Lord of the Rings ends, or even what happens starting after the Ring is destroyed? I've look through the appendices in Return of the King many times and it still seems really vague to me."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,woodyelf,14,Mon Feb 9 15:18:17 2015 UTC,"Because, we really don't know that much about what happened. The invading Easterlings were given a home in southern Mordor, Dul Guldur was destroyed, Gimli settled the Glittering Caves, Legolas helped Faramir restore Ithilien, Frodo wrote The Lord of the Rings, the ringbearers left, Aragorn reestablishes Arnor, Aragorn and Arwen died and Eldarion became the second King of the Reunited Kingdom, the Ringbearers sailed away, Sam followed them, then so did Legolas and Gimli together, the end.   Then, presumably, the elves diminish into nothing, Gondor and Arnor fall, and the rest of history happens (since Arda is a pre-history of the Earth we live in)"
CGPGrey,2vauf7,juanphinojosa,9,Mon Feb 9 16:21:36 2015 UTC,"Wait, that last bit. Middle Earth is our Earth? Can you (or someone) expand on this?   What about all the geographical differences? And, everything else! Ah.  😣"
CGPGrey,2vauf7,putiplot,21,Mon Feb 9 17:17:25 2015 UTC,"Tolkien never bothered to try to explain the geographical differences, but yeah, he set out to create a pre-history of Europe, especially Anglo-Saxon culture (he was a professor of Old English philology).   In-universe, Tolkien did not write anything. The Silmarillion, the Lord of the Rings, the Hobbit, and the Appendices are all contents of ""The Red Book of Westmarch"", written/recorded by Bilbo, Frodo, and Sam, published and preserved by Aragorn.   The Red Book was  discovered by the Saxon mariner Aelfwine, who, in the 10th century AD accidentally found the Straight Road to Valinor, and landed on Tol Eressëa, was given the books, then went home and translated them into Old English, and Tolkien translated it again into Modern English."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,GalenLambert,5,Mon Feb 9 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thank you. I only recently started learning about LotR after trying to prove Master Chief could deliver the One Ring faster than Frodo on /r/whowouldwin."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,putiplot,10,Mon Feb 9 17:33:07 2015 UTC,"Hm, like Grey said, the Chief would probably fall under it's influence and take it for himself almost immediately.   Anyway, if you want to read more, here's the gateway page on Aelfwine."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,the-spb,3,Mon Feb 9 17:36:10 2015 UTC,"That's what most people said, but I really doubt he could wear it. His fingers are large even without this armor, which he couldn't be able to remove while in Middle Earth. So wouldn't he not get the full effect of the Ring's power? I also feel like he could just sort of throw it.   Thanks, I love me some lore."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,CgRazor,8,Mon Feb 9 17:39:36 2015 UTC,"One of the ring's powers it to adjust it's size: It appears to be the perfect size for every user, and it sometimes will squeeze onto the user's finger or expand so that it falls off, if doing one or the other will bring it closer to its Master.   He certainly could throw it, but he almost certainly wouldn't. The ring tempts everyone near it. It didn't take long at all for Boromir, a great and steadfast hero to try to take it for himself, Galadriel(one of the only remaining High Elves) and Gandalf(an agent of God) wanted to avoid being near it, because of it's corrupting influence, and Frodo's decision to leave the fellowship is supported by the narrator and other characters because it's a certainty that someone would try to take it again. Only the Hobbits can resist it's influence, and only for a little while."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,Zagorath,8,Mon Feb 9 17:58:48 2015 UTC,Is kittyninjafish still helping you out with the art? I've noticed a pretty significant change in the type of artwork used in your most recent videos compared to those in the past. It seems like there is a lot more detail on the drawings than there ever was before in the last couple videos.   Edit: I looked at the description and feel great shame now.

CGPGrey,2vauf7,Lordrandall,12,Mon Feb 9 14:36:02 2015 UTC,Honestly he reminded me more of a garden gnome
CGPGrey,2vauf7,kataskopo,6,Mon Feb 9 14:56:30 2015 UTC,"Although interestingly, Tom Riddle is extremely like Sauron. Not just that they're both the main villains in their respective books, but also that both are essentially liches. Beings that tied their soul to a physical object (a phylactery) in order to extend their lives/power.  Obviously it doesn't quite work, since Sauron was never a human to begin with, and rather than extended his life through the pouring his soul into the ring, he increased his power over others. But it's an interesting thought even so."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,Niek_pas,2,Mon Feb 9 15:27:16 2015 UTC,Never mind the fact that these characters are essentially the antithesis of each other and live in completely different universes. But it's a great pun!
CGPGrey,2vauf7,CgRazor,12,Mon Feb 9 15:24:31 2015 UTC,"CGP Grey should definately make an extra video on Tom Bombadil, because wtf is up with Tom Bombadil."

CGPGrey,2vauf7,goochockey,6,Mon Feb 9 14:37:14 2015 UTC,"Why does sauron continue to stay alive as long as the ring persists, that's what I never understood. Does tolkien ever indulge on this aspect of the mythology, would gandalf or saruman be capable of doing something like this as well?"
CGPGrey,2vauf7,Nick_Stephenson,6,Mon Feb 9 15:48:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're asking, Sauron, Gandalf, and Saruman are all incarnated Ainur (angelic spirits), so their all immortal in a fashion similar to elves. That is, they can be slain, but other than that they won't die.  Sauron is a little unique in that he is the only Ainur to to have reincarnated himself multiple times after dying. When the Ring is destroyed so is the greater part of his inherent angelic power. As a result he's reduced to a impotent spirit, unable to reincarnate himself as he did after previous deaths."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,countdownnet,3,Mon Feb 9 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"I'm curious if tolkien ever explained what Sauron has done to himself or to the ring that provides this reincarnation ability. For example, has he sacrificed some part of his angelic spirit and that is why he is reduced to a impotent spirit once the ring is destroyed?  The video does a good job of explaining how the ring is designed to corrupt and rule over everyone, but it says nothing about why reincarnation is part of the package."
CGPGrey,2vauf7,PrivateChicken,7,Mon Feb 9 16:27:55 2015 UTC,"That's because reincarnation isn't part of the package.  First of all separate out the concepts of an Ainu's inherent power, and their Spirit.  Sauron's inherent power was great enough that he could reincarnate his spirit into a physical form multiple times. Most Ainur only manage to do this once. This is without the Ring. It's just something Sauron can do.  Later on, Sauron forges the Ring to enhance his inherent power. He puts most of it into the Ring, and when he wears it he gains access to that extra power. If Sauron does not wear the Ring, that power is still in rapport with himself. So Sauron isn't diminished without the Ring.  However, when the Ring is destroyed, so is the power he invested into it. It is no longer in rapport with Sauron. As a result, Sauron's incarnated body can no longer sustain itself and he is reduced to an impotent spirit.  The term ""power"" is used vaguely here, but just know that it's a measure of ""angelic will/magic,"" and distinct from Sauron's spirit."

CGPGrey,2uhvms,Ghost_X,129,Mon Feb 2 19:02:05 2015 UTC,"In defense of airport carpets.  While I do very much prefer no carpets in my home, there are many reasons for carpets in airports.  First, as unintuitive as it is, high-traffic carpets are easier to clean and are safer and more hygenic for users.  While hard surfaces can be made more hygenic immediately after cleaning (although usually not as mop buckets tend to leave a film of gunk over floors), anything which comes into contact with them stays on the surface and transfers more easily to anything else coming in contact with it. Dry material falls into carpet while moist material is absorbed. As long as the carpet isn't too thick and has replaceable tiles for too heavily soiled sections, then your average contact with carpet is going to transfer less to you than hard surfaces.  Also, since high-traffic carpets will absorb a small amount of liquid, it will stay contained instead of spreading around into a slippery film which can cause people to fall.  The problem with carpeting is removing soil and that is where most organizations and people go wrong. Vacuum cleaners get larger debris out of carpet reasonably well, but small debris and dust is difficult to deal with. High-traffic carpet is well suited to higher levels of suction which pulls more out and if the cleaner has proper filters, very little will end up floating around in the air, but this is often a problem.  Other advantages are that carpet reduces ambient noise (very important in airports) and is more easily (and inexpensively) able to display patterns which really do help regulate the mood of users."
CGPGrey,2uhvms,JeffDujon,27,Tue Feb 3 04:02:56 2015 UTC,Interesting arguments. This should be in feedback.
CGPGrey,2uhvms,articulationsvlog,12,Mon Feb 2 21:22:05 2015 UTC,Great comment.
CGPGrey,2uhvms,byratino,7,Tue Feb 3 01:11:39 2015 UTC,"While I do agree that high-traffic, commercial carpets are definitely far superior to traditional home carpets, in general they're still not the ideal choice for commercial spaces. The problem, other than people not properly maintaining and cleaning carpets (as you point out), is that they are often less durable and less sustainable than alternative materials. I work on a lot of projects in Canada and other northern climates where things like dirt, snow and salt soil the floor on a continuous basis. Many places have to constantly replace and maintain their carpets - which can be very costly. Most carpets products are also non-recyclable and they end up in landfills.  As for acoustics. I will grant that carpets do help in reducing ambient noise - but so do resilient flooring materials like rubber and cork - and those materials are generally much easier to maintain and are much more durable.  Of course that is not to say carpet is 100% unusable. There are always suitable situations depending on the circumstances. In one of those private, airport lounges? It's probably alright. But in a high-traffic concourse? Probably not.  Edit: also, definitely thumbs up for carpet tiles instead of rolls."

CGPGrey,2uhvms,ttoyooka,57,Mon Feb 2 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"Grey, my perspective on the presidential desk matter is very different from yours. I think the value of an historical object goes up when important people interact with it (as long as they don't, you know, completely destroy it). I'm sure that on the White House tours of the future, if the guide says ""the stain on this desk was made by President Grey, who was known for his love of coffee and as a defender of its value as the fuel of the modern world"", all the tourists would go ""oohh"" and ""aaahh"" and snap pictures. Immaculate objects are boring. Also, if you choose to work on another desk, all you'll do is create another important historical object.  Another thing: no guests? Ever? Really? Why?! You guys know we'd love to hear Vi or Destin or Dirk from Veratasion on HI. If that is not going to happen then we need a Random Acts of Intelligent (plus Vi) podcast stat, even if the panel of hosts has to rotate from episode to episode."
CGPGrey,2uhvms,vmax77,25,Mon Feb 2 22:36:28 2015 UTC,"I think you've expressed the philosophy of Brady's new channel ""Objectivity"", so I suspect he would totally agree with you.  The more and the longer it gets sequestered away, the less it actually becomes the President's desk any more.  Actually, it's a bit surprising to hear Grey being so protective of a mere object.  I mean, the object might be historical, but it's there for a purpose; I would have expected Grey to be a bit more utilitarian.  Also, I too would love to see guests on the show, maybe as a segment of an episode; they don't need to be present for the whole thing.  Although, if Drake from Vestibulium actually appeared on the show, I'm not sure how that would impact the running joke.  Oh, god, I know - the gag should be reversed - the hosts should switch to introducing him correctly, and he should repeatedly correct the hosts by referring to himself using all the different incorrect names."

Of course, they say: Yes, you can change their actions with your mind because insert thing I just said.  They do this in basically every episode so far."

CGPGrey,2uhvms,Zagorath,14,Mon Feb 2 17:13:21 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you on the downside of YouTube being so big. YouTube has been the big player in the industry for so long, and they're just awful in so many ways. Their attitude to copyright is just insanely anti-video-maker.  Their attitude towards fair use is that they assume it could never possibly be fair use until the uploader specifically refutes the claim.  People frequently get dinged for public domain content, or content that they own. For example, public domain NASA broadcasts, rebroadcast by TV news, has resulted in other people using the public domain stuff getting dinged as violating the TV news station's copyright. I've also had my own personal recordings of public domain classical music get dinged as being copyrighted — in one case, it was even claiming it was a completely different piece of music.  And in some cases, just things that sound similar to other stuff that some copyright troll in Brazil has put up on Content ID get dinged.  And there's zero penalty for copyright holders making false claims to copyright against a video.  And now there's this new whole story, which takes it all to a whole new level.  All of the above could probably be at least partly defended by laziness and just wanting to bow down to big record labels etc. But this new story is very directly the fault of YouTube itself, and nobody else. It's just horrible.  There desperately needs to be a viable YouTube competitor. But they need to keep the strong social features that YouTube has (subscriptions, comments/comment replies, good, easy monetisation options for both large and small video producers, etc.).    Regarding the Yahoo! thing, they're going to distributing the next season of the TV show Community, which has a pretty substantial audience. Yahoo's video site, Screen, is already up and running, though I must admit I've not looked at it. I think they hope to leverage Community to drive a larger audience towards it. Hopefully their monetisation options for normal video producers are good.  But I've just taken a quick look at the site, and in two or three minutes of looking I couldn't find any option to upload a video. I suspect they don't want to be a YouTube competitor."
CGPGrey,2uhvms,linuxguruintraining,2,Mon Feb 2 18:57:26 2015 UTC,Agreed. This monopsony has to be broken. YouTube has far too much power. Think we could get out that tank that fought Google+? I really want to do something about this so that independent musicans don't get locked into indentured slavery to Google. Preferably something cheaper than making my own video-hosting service.  *edit: grammar
CGPGrey,2uhvms,MaceWinnoob,8,Mon Feb 2 09:08:50 2015 UTC,"Think we could get out that tank that fought Google+   Urgh please no, that was asinine.  The G+ comments changeover is actually, IMO, one thing that YouTube does right. A big part of the reason YouTube is so successful is that ignoring all the copyright stuff, it's really, really fucking good. People occasionally have issues with their subscription boxes, but for the most part it works well. They have a great model for sharing revenue with video producers. Their ability to stream large quantities of video to huge numbers of users, in a wide variety of content formats (in terms of quality of video and devices it's being played back on) isn't even close to being approached by anyone else.  And the comments change was a massive improvement. Longer comments allow for more well-explained debate. In-line replies allow people to have conversations better, and not repeat the same thing in eight different disparate chat threads. Links allow supporting sources to be provided. And formatting lets you make things that are easier to read.  All that is why YouTube has its dominant position, and why it's so hard for someone else to break in. But they've clearly fucked up regarding copyright issues, and it's something that I, and many other users, really hate. I'm a huge Google fanboy, but I just despise the way they treat YouTube and YouTubers.  I really do hope someone can come in and match them, because more competition would hopefully force YouTube to do better for users on the copyright front. And if not, at least users could go elsewhere to share their content — and viewers will doubtless follow where the good content is.  I really do hope this can happen. I just can't see it happening. The cost of entry is too high…"
CGPGrey,2uhvms,watersplitting,5,Mon Feb 2 11:41:33 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you on the Google+ thing. As much as it hurts to suggest this as a Linux user, maybe Microsoft could compete with YouTube? Actually, I really like that idea. Instead of views stopping at 301, they could just arbitrarily jump from 360 to one and from 8 to 10. I'd like that."
CGPGrey,2uhvms,vmax77,3,Mon Feb 2 11:53:41 2015 UTC,"Why do you disagree with the G+ thing? You're not one of those reactionaries who hates it just because it's integrated with a different system, are you? Or do you have an actual functional criticism of the features of the new system versus the old?   Regarding Microsoft, I definitely think they could make a splash if they tried. I wouldn't mind seeing it."
CGPGrey,2uhvms,googolplexbyte,3,Mon Feb 2 12:13:44 2015 UTC,"I just remember it being a buggy mess when it was first implemented. The button to leave a comment was broken half the time, although I could be wrong knowing what I know about memory. I think conversations were actually easier to follow under the old system as well, but again it was a long time ago.

CGPGrey,2uhvms,googolplexbyte,2,Mon Feb 2 12:55:14 2015 UTC,I think G+ was the best way to get people to start coming out of the shadows and give their profile some sort of identity so the youtube comments won't be quite as brainless and terrible.

CGPGrey,2uhvms,SleepyHarry,3,Mon Feb 2 13:23:58 2015 UTC,"I don’t think they really can compete with YouTube, at least not yet.  They would need big creators (like Brady and Grey) to put (at least some of their) content on their site exclusively to entice viewers to transition. But without the audience there is nothing to entice creators to transition. I mean if Grey started posting his videos somewhere other than YouTube as well – I wouldn't change; I’d just keep watching them on YouTube as I do now. But maybe with the content that Yahoo can get on now they can build a user base to the point where they can get the backing of creators and then compete with YouTube."

(Wiki lookup - wiki agrees)  I think this comes from how some foreign languages have traditionally been transliterated into English, particularly Arabic languages which have never had reasonably standard/""official"" transliterations.  This is, incidentally, why Muahmar Khaddafi's name can be spelled about 47 different ways (in a row), and none of them is really more or less correct than the others.  The ""j"" sound as in ""juice"" is traditionally transliterated as ""dj"", ""dg"" or ""dʒ"" (Grey loves IPA like I do.  Actually, I like it as an idea, it's just not terribly effective for anyone other than professional linguists.).  This is to capture the actual sounds this ""j"" sound makes, and often disambiguates it from when it's used as a ""y"" sound in some languages, particularly Germanic languages - jawhol, fjord, johannes, etc."

I can't believe Brady hasn't ever sworn and neither of you have ever smoked a cigarette or tried any drugs.  Haven't you ever been curious what the fuss is about? I am really tempted to look at a photo of Grey.  I searched for a guy with glasses during the mile of pi video. Then I heard the argument for not seeing his face and sorta agreed.  I remember seeing an ad for the morning radio show with the hosts on it and having a much worse listening experience after.  But it is so tempting. The show notes are a great resource. Thanks for making it so thorough. The editing process was shockingly long.  That is actually how I discovered the podcast btw.  I went searching through all cgp grey videos and found it. The news sucks and I have basically cut it out of my life too.  This is a strange thing because I also am an activist and one of our main tactics is to get media coverage.  I try to read articles that my friends post on facebook on things that seem worthy of public attention, like government policies that needlessly harm people or the environment.  To me that is the only important thing to pay attention to because government do respond to public outrage. I loved the humans need not apply video and I agree mostly with Grey.  Unemployment in Canada has been increasing over the last 20 or so years and I reckon that this is why.  I think that automation unstoppable and objectively a good thing.  The problem to me is that the beneficiaries of automation have been owners of companies that benefit from it and everyone else is not seeing improvements in their lives because work is harder to find now.  I think that this will almost inevitably lead to revolution if the economy and tax policies and redistributive policies are not changed immensely in the next little while.  I am not optimistic about this. I agree the state flags stink!  I want to hear more about Brady's past and how he got to where he is now.  I also want to know more about his process with work.  Grey talks a lot about his but we never hear much about Brady. You guys should get Destin on the podcast sometime.  I am sure that would be fun for everyone. I often find myself laughing out loud in public places while listening to the podcast. I hate the abrupt endings.  And the long pause before the bonus finish. Love the theme music.  Wouldn't mind hearing more talk about music or sounds. I guess that's all I got.  Great work guys keep it up!"

One thing to add as a second piece to this is that other people are often only meaning to argue ""we should move this way"", and what they're saying is ""the extreme on that side is better than the other"".  So, if you see someone advocating radical socialism, it might actually be that their ideal is to tweak their county slightly more to the left, and they think the best way to argue this is by arguing very forcefully for something more extreme.  Second thought: It's perfectly possible for two people to live in slightly different contexts that makes both of them quite reasonable in wanting to move the equilibrium in opposite directions.   I live in a centre-left country so I advocate right-wing policies, you live in a centre-right contry so you advocate left wing policies.

History is a stream of events: it doesn't teach lessons, historians teach lessons. They try to convince you of the correctness of their reading of these documents, or works of art or whatever. Due to the fact that history is in the past, though, we accept debates will never be fully settled: maybe we can agree on dates, but historians will always differ on why X happened.   It is actually a very old mindset in history to look for patterns in the past and one that pretty much all of academic history has long conceded is flawed since every event is determined by its own circumstances. That doesn't mean reading or learning about history is flawed, though, and I still think history (if taught properly) can teach people things about critical thinking, analysis, reasonable skepticism.  I also live in Ireland so I relate to your point that history causes a huge amount of grudge bearing but I also think it's fair to say that the people I know who are bearing 100 or 50 or 30 year old grudges are exactly the people who don't study history. It takes a great deal of distortion and not being exposed to a comprehensive for the 'grr English' or 'grr Irish' mindset to emerge.

I made it through the whole thing without realising that it wasn't fiction.  I thought it was some really podcast-attuned, new kind of story telling with hyper-realism. I couldn't believe how good the acting was, and when it ended without a resolution, I was kind of disappointed.  Then I went to the wikipedia page and felt like the biggest idiot ever. It kind of changes how you view the whole thing when you have to remember that this really happened, Adnan is a real person, this is really ongoing, these real lives were really ruined. Still excellent, but I might have to relisten.  TL;DR - I'm an idiot who apparently can't tell fact from fiction."

CGPGrey,2sxqdw,Pedrinho21,60,Mon Jan 19 21:06:21 2015 UTC,"I think Grey is relying on other people to pay attention so that he doesn't have to.    Grey is only aware of big events because other people have made it important by paying attention and discussing them where they are brought to his attention.    They have made it important because incrementally each of them cared.  If no one paid attention, there would be no impetus for larger actions, no response from from governments, organizations etc.    If I understand him, Grey thinks that if his particular attention doesn't change things - it's not worth doing. Particularly if his knowledge of such things just creates negative thoughts and frustration for him.   I think he discounts his participation in something larger - global attention.  We all own a small incremental part of the global attention.  I think it's reasonable to posit that global attention is part of what has incrementally been lowering the level of war, poverty and injustice.    It is therefore reasonable that a certain amount of frustration is necessary in an individual's life in order to move the whole course of civilization to someplace better than it was yesterday."

If no one paid attention, there would be no impetus for larger actions, no response from from governments, organizations etc.   My counter to this would be that there are many topics that I don't pay attention to because they don't interest me or require some expertise that I don't have.  I therefore have others that do keep up on this and let me know if something that needs my attention comes up.  Some people keep up on world news, some people keep tabs on tech news, some watch for local concerts playing in town, etc. and they each filter the important bits out for everyone else.

Many things have the potential to develop more empathy - stories, books, non-fictions, movies, documentaries, podcasts, volunteering for a charity, traveling, and sometimes the news. Some people just happen to derive empathy from other avenues in life. And from what I see, many people I know have little empathy despite constantly watching the news. Most people I know who follow the news avidly are constantly complaining about dirty politicians, horrible new government policies, fear of the new super bug that will kill us all, etc. Sure, some people become more empathetic reading the news, and that's great.

The best/most passionate points you made just don't apply to the news I see. The rich would get richer, the corrupt would get corrupter, injustice would happen, but you need in-depth investigative journalism for these topics and not the ""wrong but not for long""-NEWS, that are firstly wrong and have moved on to the next story of the day by the time the not-for-long happens.  Yes, there is a need for reporting that is fast and only somewhat right, but Twitter and Reddit are a lot better at being fast and wrong, as demonstrated by the TV-news in cases of tragic events where a big part of their reporting is showing pictures they found on Twitter.  I thought it was very fitting that you guys went on to talking about Serial right after*. Serial is good, thought provoking, journalism that gets people talking both about the case and the bigger picture of the justice system, but how did the news report on this 15 years ago, when they still had the monopoly on news? http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-06-07/news/0006070134_1_syed-honors-student-urick ""I went to the sentencing and had a quick look in the court files"", which is appropriate for the news cycle, but at the same time completely pointless when it comes to changing anything for better or for worse.

CGPGrey,2sxqdw,WretchedLout,16,Mon Jan 19 19:16:21 2015 UTC,For one practically speaking I'm a Politics and International Relations Undergraduate so on a personal level it's important I follow the news because most days there is a new development on something I will eventually need to write about / be able to incorporate into an essay or dissertation.   Other than this I'd argue it's important because every adult in a modern democracy (give or take) has a right to vote and with that vote comes a kind of responsibility to be informed. By this I mean that they need to be informed on what the government of the day is doing right and wrong (from your perspective) so that when the time comes to vote you  can decide for yourself if you trust them or someone else to run your country. Failing to do this leads people into the trap of either not voting (because they didn't even know about the election or they don't care) or simply voting because 'Hey i'm INSERT IDEOLOGY HERE I should vote for X Party' even though maybe they're not being effective or had some kind of major mistake which if you knew about would drive you from them for good.

CGPGrey,2sxqdw,countdownnet,7,Mon Jan 19 16:50:25 2015 UTC,I think that you need to watch the news regularly to make an informed choice that can put the points of the candidates into the proper perspective.   Our society is founded on (traditional) liberal ideals of freedom which expects a high degree of personal responsibility and active citizenship and not being informed is letting down the personal responsibility society entrusts you with.

CGPGrey,2sxqdw,mikeyReiach,7,Mon Jan 19 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"I took one of Brady's major argument to be: most people in the world follow the news to some extent (at least more then Grey) and are thinking about/concerned about what is happening in the news.  So, if you want to be able to make a decent conversational or interpersonal connection with most people (e.g. the classic ""water cooler conversation""), you need to have an awareness of what is taking up a decent chunk of their head-space.  I took Grey's counterargument (especially based on his reversal of the train metaphor) to be that he is much more interested in connecting with the people much closer to him in his immediate life (friends/family), and that the news isn't necessary for that.  His current work/life situation doesn't require him to connect on that level to a bunch of strangers, and so he can filter the news more for his own mental comfort.  So, it was instrumental back when he had a different life (e.g. teaching), but isn't instrumental now."

(I guess as a german I have to argue for this side) Furthermore I think we can broaden and enhance our individual perception of the world a great deal by learning about history. (Expressed more eloquently by John Green: http://youtu.be/Yocja_N5s1I?t=12s ) You, Grey, demonstrated this yourself by comparing our tolerance of eye-witness-testimony to the medieval tolerance of witch-trials."

CGPGrey,2sxqdw,FranzSalvatierra,10,Mon Jan 19 22:21:39 2015 UTC,"Grey, you spoke about your global amnesia-button, and gave the example of the relationship between Wales and England.  Well, I've wondered about the same thing for a long time, and what I've concluded is that it isn't about ""the other guys"" at all. The crux of the matter, as I see it, is the sense of comradeship that any given group can get from agreeing that everyone else sucks.  Basically, ""hah, look at all those black people, and/or gay people, and/or people who cheers for the wrong soccer-team (and so on). They sure do suck. Oh, and fortunately, we, in our little community, aren't like them, so we must be awesome! Cool.""  Of course, there are also other reasons for it - for instance, there are obvious religious reasons for thinking homosexuality is wrong, and I dare say you could find some political motivations for these things as well, but most of all, I think it's about a human need to belong to a group."
CGPGrey,2sxqdw,florrat,21,Mon Jan 19 16:44:42 2015 UTC,"Relating to the ""what if everybody stopped following the news"" point, I don't see how this is relevant.

CGPGrey,2rev6q,thatguywhosaidstuff,9,Mon Jan 5 18:15:20 2015 UTC,Thus I enter downwards spiral of productivity doom that is watching That Mitchell & Webb Look. See you in a few hours.
CGPGrey,2rev6q,sharkmandan,146,Mon Jan 5 20:31:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is a single time all day you can't text someone. I think it's your job to make sure your phone is off or in Do Not Disturb mode, not mine to try to figure out whether or not you're asleep."
CGPGrey,2rev6q,vmax77,55,Thu Jan 8 23:08:53 2015 UTC,"Yea  If the reasoning is that most people don't change those settings, than you can also assume they have their facebook and gmail settings as default, meaning they get the same kinds of notification noises if you email or FB message them in the middle of the night. Either it's acceptable to send texts at all times of the day, or it is unacceptable to send emails."
CGPGrey,2rev6q,DopplerRadio,17,Mon Jan 5 17:30:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Most people have email sent straight to their phone, so an email and a text would make a similar noise."
CGPGrey,2rev6q,articulationsvlog,29,Mon Jan 5 19:56:54 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I thought. I was baffled they were even having this conversation, I think it's entirely the receiver's responsibility to turn off his phone or put it on silent mode if they don't want to be disturbed. Everyone I know along with myself, just text and message each other whenever, and it's expected that the person will respond whenever they aren't busy or asleep anymore. I can't think of a reason to go about it any other way.  At one point, Grey said; ""Can I assume that enough people know how to use their own phone that it is perfectly fine to message people, when you would assume that they would be asleep, because you can also assume they have decided how they wish to receive communication?""  And the obvious answer is... YES! Yes you can."
CGPGrey,2rev6q,Amr_E,11,Mon Jan 5 21:07:32 2015 UTC,"The counterpoint to this is that not everybody has a ""Do Not Disturb"" mode on their phone. People still on older phones don't have the same options, so they then have to make the decision on silencing their phone entirely (thus making them unreachable in case of emergency) or leaving themselves open to 3AM text messages.  For those people you know use a smartphone, the burden of a time-based SMS filter may fall on them, but unless you're sure that a ""Do Not Disturb"" option is within the receiver's power, I'd say that the sender should observe a certain level of etiquette.  (Of course, this only applies to text messages; Facebook messaging and email notifications, for example, are still fully silence-able for those who have them.)"
CGPGrey,2rev6q,GlassOrange,12,Tue Jan 6 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"Not even at four in the goddamn morning, when 94% of people are asleep?[3]   Why? Text messages are an asynchronous medium - I can send one at 4AM when I'm awake, you can reply at 8AM when you're awake, and I can read the reply at 1PM when I'm awake again. This is convenient for everyone involved, except if you leave your phone in a mode where it wakes you up.  Just because the majority of people keep ""regular"" hours doesn't mean we all do."
CGPGrey,2rev6q,vmax77,6,Mon Jan 5 21:19:05 2015 UTC,"I had a dumbphone too until a couple years ago. And maybe I'm wrong but even the dumbest cellphone nowadays have the ability to be put on silent. And what I always did was just put all alerts but calls to silent before I went to sleep. Some may think it's annoying to have to press silent on your phone every night but for me it just became a mechanical movement I got used to.   Now I also agree there should not be a reason to text someone at 4am unless it's an emergency. But the problem is not 4am but the grey areas in the late evenings and early mornings where there can never be a universally agreed upon ""right time"". I've had people annoyed at me for texting them at 8:00pm because their young kids are in bed early. And while I can keep track of approximate bedtimes of most adults - I can't keep track of all the particular preferences all my friends have - like odd night shifts, different time zones and young kids. So IMO - for simplicity sake - it should be the receiver of the SMS's responsibility to determine how they set their alerts."
CGPGrey,2rev6q,Amr_E,17,Tue Jan 6 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"I agree but I still avoid sending people texts in the middle of the night. I don't want them thinking ""why is /u/curledbdt up at 3 in the morning?"" I do the same with e-mails."
CGPGrey,2rev6q,JeffDujon,14,Tue Jan 6 10:11:41 2015 UTC,"That's a valid reason, especially if it's your boss or your parents or someone else you want to think you actually have a work ethic and don't piss away hours and hours on reddit."
CGPGrey,2rev6q,Schmlonathan,11,Tue Jan 6 16:30:42 2015 UTC,Ha! That's why I always send e-mails around 7 or 8 in the morning. Makes people think you're a hard worker.
CGPGrey,2rev6q,BoxBopChallenge,3,Mon Jan 5 21:00:59 2015 UTC,"Surely it's just synchronous v asynchronous? Texts, emails, some IMs, because they can be read at any time, can be sent at any time. You aren't responsible for reading texts instantly. So you should generally not be disturbed by them.  Whereas calls, skypes etc require instant action. And so you should be exceptionally cautious about sending them.  That said. I don't get so worried about ""emergency"" calls. There's no plausible emergancy where me being involved at 4am would actually help. I put my phone on flight mode. If someone's dead I'll find out in  the morning."
CGPGrey,2rev6q,vmax77,3,Mon Jan 5 21:07:01 2015 UTC,"I agree, it even came up in the discussion between 2 people, Brady wouldn't text until 9, but that's still too early for Grey.   It's unrealistic to memorize everybody's scheduled and preferences. Add in people overseas and people working night shifts, I can't be expected to keep track of all that.   SMS is asynchronous, if you don't want to be bothered adjust your settings. If it's an emergency I will call."

Another YouTuber (I don't want to badmouth by name) did a review with a Plinkett impersonation that did not sound as natural and got enough negative feedback that he released a rerecorded version of the same review with his normal voice, begrudgingly.

Phone calls are a type of synchronous communication. As in, pretty much literally real-time.  Text messages are semi-synchronous communication. They tend to range from close-to-real-time to a few hours' gaps at most.  Email is asynchronous communication. There's basically no expectation, generally, that when you send an email, the person you're addressing is going to immediately receive it.    As for whether you can expect other people to know how to use their phones, I have two points:  (1.) These extremely valuable functions are going to get easier and more ubiquitous over time, so the fact that most people probably don't use them now is almost definitely a short-term phenomenon. In particular, I'm sure the urgent news problem Brady's worried about will be resolved eventually.  (2.) You should go ahead and start using your phone as if everyone else knows how to use their phone, because you're contributing to the cultural pressure towards everyone learning how to use their damn phones."

Mumble's voice quality is also really, really good with the right settings (basically make sure Opus is enabled [which it is by default] and turn the bandwidth cap up). You'd have to host a server or pay for one, but its not that difficult to host yourself and servers are cheap if you want someone else to do it.  Obviously you have a system and it works, but I'm just making the suggestion in case you wanted to optimize it a bit."
CGPGrey,2qxt2l,PhyxsiusPrime,2,Wed Dec 31 21:05:22 2014 UTC,i can't imagine with their clapping sync system that it really takes very long to sync the two files. and i'd never considered the benefit of being able to displace the talking over each other bits. nifty.

CGPGrey,2qxt2l,throwaway_the_fourth,19,Wed Dec 31 19:09:01 2014 UTC,I just wondered what he's making space for on his screen until I realised it's video games and Prison Architect is one of those greyesque video games. Not really a game but more a second job within a game. So realising he plays Prison Architect during editing made me laugh.

I know you're a creature of neurotic, perfectionist habit, but I do wonder if you are really getting the kind of utility out of a 3X process that recoups the time you spend?  I edit a weekly podcast that runs about an hour, and I get to the point where I'm comfy after one 1X speed run through (and I'm told by all involved it sounds good).    I hope the above doesn't read like a critique.  Just an out-loud thought.  On another note, I'd love to see what the pre-podcast workup looks like for you guys.  What is the show-notes ritual, etc.?"

CGPGrey,2qxt2l,ZwiebelKatze,8,Wed Dec 31 20:16:18 2014 UTC,"Timestamp links with ampersand are better than with number sign.  When # is used browser starts playing video from 0:00 and another bufferization is needed to switch to playing from the timestamp. When & is used, browser starts playing from the timestamp.  I'm note sure about technical details, but since Google is fairly good with abiding to Internet standards, possible explanation follows.  Difference between timestamp links made with #t=XXXX and &t=XXXX is the place where assigned variable t goes. When number sign (#) is used browser ""reads"" the variable after the page loads. When ampersand is used, the variable becomes the part of ""GET"" http request for the server. This means that the page server sends back to the browser already contains information about variable t.    Another issue: timestamp that uses minutes and seconds is human readable, while timestamp that uses just seconds is not. &t=39m3s is better than &t=2343.

I grew up with mm/dd/yyyy, so it has always been very readable to me. On the other hand, I find dd/mm/yyyy to be the least readable.  What formats are more readable than what other formats is pretty subjective. It isn't the same for everyone."

""Peter was always a geek in terms of technology but, once he had the means to do it, and the evolution of the technology really took off, he never looked back. In the first movie, yes, there’s Rivendell, and Mordor, but there’s sort of an organic quality to it, actors acting with each other, and real landscapes; it’s grittier. The second movie already started ballooning, for my taste, and then by the third one, there were a lot of special effects. It was grandiose, and all that, but whatever was subtle, in the first movie, gradually got lost in the second and third. Now with The Hobbit, one and two, it’s like that to the power of 10."""

CGPGrey,2qcola,JeffDujon,25,Thu Dec 25 08:40:27 2014 UTC,"Grey, you are dead-wrong about the IPA. Clearly time constraints were preventing you from looking deeper into it, but it really only takes a couple of hours to get the hang of IPA. It just has a learning curve.   Pasting IPA into a speech synthesis program might not give optimal results, for a few reasons :   Firstly because people are still figuring out how to actually type IPA into a computer (Unicode seems to solve this problem, but it's still wonky with the diacritics),  and secondly because IPA is often used to transcribe the phonemes,  that may be pronounced differently depending on the language, rather than the phones, meaning it's often an approximation, not a 1-to-1 phonetically accurate translation.    I can see your frustration, and certainly IPA is not perfect in ever possible way, but it's the most precise way to convey every possible human speech sound in a compact written form.  Sorry for the rant, I really like IPA.   (full disclosure: I'm not a professional linguist, I just took a basic linguistics class back in university ;)   Oh, and merry Christmas!"

CGPGrey,2qcola,JeffDujon,12,Thu Dec 25 22:23:01 2014 UTC,Grey asked why Peter Jackson was 'selected' for LoTR. I'm pretty sure he selected himself. It was his project and he did the hard yards going to all the studios getting funding for the movies. Can do Kiwi attitude at work. #notbiased EDIT: this may also explain why he did a much better job on LoTR. It was a life long dream and he'd put so much effort into getting it off the ground whereas with Hobbit he replaced Del Toro at the last minute.

It's a weird position to be in because culturally we've transplanted a winter tradition into the middle of summer. So I spent this afternoon playing backyard cricket with my nephews while digesting a very solid, winter-style meal of roast lamb, turkey, Christmas pudding etc.   Aside from the Queen's Christmas message, which some of the older members of my family like to watch, tv and the movies play almost no part in the day's activities (unless it's raining). Given the sun sets at 9.30, there's no real reason to go indoors.  Started listening at 11.30 pm."
CGPGrey,2qcola,runawaylemon,6,Thu Dec 25 09:11:42 2014 UTC,"Does that do it for you, Brady   When you said that, Grey, it sounded creepily sexual.   perfect balance of consistency, but also mystery   That is a perfect explanation of Tolkien's universe.    You think you had problems with trying to buy tickets? You should try the site that I was on trying to book tickets.. First of all, the drop down options just don’t work half the time. I’ll select the cinema (Cantavil), and then the option to select the movie is supposed to start working. But I only once managed to get that to work.  Once that finally did decide to work, I went through the process, until I got to the point of selecting which seats I wanted. I selected the two seats I wanted, and it gave some pop up saying that the seats need to be contiguous. They were contiguous. I tried moving them into a bunch of different locations, before I discovered it would only work if they were against the left-most edge of the screen. URGH.  Went and had a look at the HTML on the page. The comments on it (thankfully they didn’t mininfy it) made it seem that what they were trying to do was prevent you from booking seats that aren’t contiguous. They just buggered up the JavaScript code. Urgh. A feature that they just really did not need to have at all, and its buggy implementation meant I couldn’t properly order tickets at all.    Want to point out that Bilbo’s stone throwing thing is actually kinda canon. His stone throwing is supposed to be really OP. I actually thought the moment where they used that in the film was just an awesome nod to the original source material.  I really thought that The Hobbit 3 was by far the best of the three films. I liked the other two a lot more than you guys did, but definitely thought they had huge problems. I didn’t actually have any problem with this one as I left the cinema.  But I agree with some of your specific problems. Legolas was definitely too sombre and didn’t really need to be there. It would’ve been nice to have some resolution to the politics surrounding the battle. The battle going on as long as it did and having people just keep popping up is a bit of a problem.  Even there, I think all the problems had good justifications. The Aragorn reference had me squealing like a schoolgirl (in my head, at least). One of the biggest criticisms of the original trilogy was the half dozen false endings to RotK. If they had included the politics stuff, that would have added a false ending. I thought they actually did a really good job, and didn’t really have any false endings to speak of. The battle itself, I really enjoyed. I don’t know why; I found the action sequences in both the other Hobbit films too long by a huge margin, but I just thought this one did it really well."

Mainly the like weird, erratic shifts in tone. Bad Guy is smashing the ice and then comically falls in.

CGPGrey,2qcola,IncredibleMango,5,Thu Dec 25 13:03:43 2014 UTC,"Listening to the podcast, possibly the reason for Tolkien not enjoying writing battle scenes, was his fighting in WWI. His description of Mordor is very similar to the battlefields of that war. A desolate place, the volcano on the background creating a similar environment to that of artillery firing, flashes of light and sound. The surfer the would emerge from such a volcano would serve as the chemical weapons employed during this conflict.   Thoughts?"

Braindead aka Dead Alive has lots of incredibly complicated creature and gore effects for the scale of its budget.  Even though Lord of the Rings films may have been his first big projects, he certainly demonstrated he was a capable filmmaker with his older films.  Dead Alive also is a good example of his cartoonish comedy/action sensibilities and in a context where they work much better than in The Hobbit."

I thought it did a great job of explaining the basic important bits of the Tolkien universe, without going into too much unnecessary detail (which is certainly very easy to do when talking about Tolkien's works).  The only thing that I might have thought worthy of mention would be that Melkor, after he became outwardly evil, was given the name Morgoth. (Also, potential mistake — though could just be an easter egg — in the animation: you put ""Morgoth"" in at 1:12 as the ""fifteenth Valar"", but every other mention of him went by Melkor.)"

CGPGrey,2pky88,vmax77,17,Wed Dec 17 15:21:50 2014 UTC,"I assume that this is the ""lambasting"" to which you refer.  It's certainly an interesting theory, and I'm not entirely sure it's wrong, but it does sound very similar to some other allegories that people have read into Tolkien's work, namely WWII with LotR and even anti-communism through Sauron. These other two readings have been vehemently repudiated by Tolkien himself.  For example, in relation to the latter reading, he said ""I utterly repudiate any such reading, which angers me. The situation was conceived long before the Russian revolution. Such allegory is entirely foreign to my thought."" This, as well as some of his other writings, make it seem fairly clear that Tolkien was not a fan of using allegory in his work at all.  It certainly is possible that he wrote the Battle of the Five Armies with WWI in mind, and that his aversion to allegory came along later, from the sources I've found, there's nothing that explicitly denies this. However, it seems unlikely to me, based on what information we do have at hand."
CGPGrey,2pky88,RootBoy42,7,Wed Dec 17 15:25:29 2014 UTC,"That's the moment lol. I have read the Hobbit multiple times and that post was made when I saw a news article regarding the anniversary of the first day of WWI and thought that it was strange how some things in the Hobbit matched up.   I have seen that Tolkien despised allegory, it's in the foreword of the LOTR, but I just can't seem to believe that he didn't have some influences from his experience in the war."
CGPGrey,2pky88,jwaldrep,10,Wed Dec 17 15:41:37 2014 UTC,"Oh it's certainly ridiculous to say that Tolkien — or any author, filmmaker, or other creative — was not influenced by the events of his lifetime. It's also very often worth bringing up these potential subconscious influences when discussing their creation.  I just think — particularly when the author has gone out of their way to mention that they don't like this kind of thing — we need to be careful about stating (or even implying) that it may have been a deliberate, conscious, choice."

While Dwarves were not created by Eru, Aule created them to be like his master. Melkor wanted to become his own master. Eru saw Aule's heart in the matter, and breathed life into the Dwarves (which Aule couldn't do on his own), thereby blessing Aule's efforts and elevating the Dwarves to (roughly) equal levels with Men and Elves."
CGPGrey,2pky88,articulationsvlog,18,Wed Dec 17 17:12:30 2014 UTC,"My favorite bit about the creation myth in The Silmarillion is where Melkor tried to make his own song, but Iluvatar kept using Melkor's song as a theme/subset of his own. No matter how hard Melkor tried to make his own thing, it only ever worked in with Iluvatar's song. Eventually, when Melkor became frustrated with it, Iluvatar explained to Melkor that he could not create his own thing because the ability to create originated in him (Iluvatar), and the Valar's ability to create was an extension of that.  To me, this is what really made the beginning of The Silmarillion work. I was kinda sad when it wasn't in the video, but I totally get why it was cut. Even the Silmarils and the event which made Melkor be known as Morgoth were cut."
CGPGrey,2pky88,GDroby,5,Thu Dec 18 07:01:48 2014 UTC,"I always saw Melkor's song as a completely just thing to try to achieve.

Melkor is a creation and the evil is fostered by the Valar."

CGPGrey,2pky88,a_guile,3,Wed Dec 17 18:04:27 2014 UTC,"It seems Grey puts things on back burners and/or shelves them for later quite often. He discusses this on a few Hello Internet episodes. As a youtuber I can totally relate. It's not that some videos take two entire years to make - it's that sometimes you start on a project and many different factors could disrupt your schedule and cause you pause the project and revisit at a later time - sometimes it's a couple months later, sometimes it's years."
CGPGrey,2pky88,jwaldrep,7,Wed Dec 17 18:52:45 2014 UTC,What is the significance of the yellow Grey logo with gears on the left side of the thumbnail? It is usually white and sometimes green; this leads me to believe that it is some kind way of categorizing videos. Is this assumption correct?
CGPGrey,2pky88,a_guile,2,Wed Dec 17 18:56:01 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the green is for his vlogs and the white is for the regular ""Grey Explains"" videos, the yellow might just be different nature of this video"

CGPGrey,2pky88,Scrubie_Wahoooo,11,Sun Dec 21 09:46:41 2014 UTC,"I thought that one of the mysteries of the Tolkien-Verse was how Morgoth created the orcs. I have read that there is some conflicting material about whether Morgoth could control the Secret fire and create life. IIRC, orcs being an unredeemable race of evil clashed with Tolkien's Catholic beliefs. However, some people have questioned if Elves could be corrupted and bred, because they have some power that means their soul can leave the body if they suffer a great trauma. If anyone who is more well versed in Tolkien's work could explain, I would be grateful!"
CGPGrey,2pky88,Gadren,26,Wed Dec 17 15:18:51 2014 UTC,I have read that there is some conflicting material…   The creation of the Orcs is one of several contentious points for Tolkien nerds.  I had to pick a version of the story and just run with it.
CGPGrey,2pky88,articulationsvlog,5,Wed Dec 17 15:36:41 2014 UTC,"Well, I for one think you made the right choice. For the masses, the kind that like the books and movies but haven't gotten into the lore, the elf orcgenesis is much more fun than the ""evil can't beget"" stuff that puts them together with trolls and dragons, even if it may fit better with Tolkein's latter philosophy."
CGPGrey,2pky88,TuncJH,24,Wed Dec 17 15:23:05 2014 UTC,"Hopefully Brady can successfully get Grey into ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" because while LoTR is great, I believe the lore of ASOIAF lends itself to a video of this style in a much better way than LoTR can. Grey does tend to be a non-conformist in a lot of ways but I really hope he sees past the popularity and watches Game of Thrones or read the books, despite the size of the series and the time commitment that goes along with it."
CGPGrey,2pky88,Heifsin85,8,Wed Dec 17 16:35:17 2014 UTC,"I believe the lore of ASOIAF lends itself to a video of this style in a much better way than LoTR can   I don't necessarily disagree, because I think they both have some absolutely brilliant lore behind them, but I do wonder why you say that."
CGPGrey,2pky88,warmth,13,Wed Dec 17 16:42:49 2014 UTC,My guess is he's referring to the House Lineages and stuff rather than mythological lore per se. More like History rather than Religion
CGPGrey,2pky88,Mike_Fraud_Ross,3,Wed Dec 17 17:37:47 2014 UTC,"In conclusion, Grey, read ""A Song of Ice and Fire"". It really is an excellent series. Edit: Fixed comma."

In one of the HI podcasts you mention that you don't like fantasy because of all the made up vocabulary you need to learn. Then you make this and I think less than half the words in that video are in the dictionary.  Come on man, admit it. You like fantasy. Because fantasy is cool... Like bowties."

CGPGrey,2pky88,JFeldhaus,3,Wed Dec 17 19:00:21 2014 UTC,"For anyone interested in the details of Tolkien's world, I definitely have to recommend listening to all the podcasts of The Tolkien Professor, Corey Olsen. He's an English professor who specializes in medieval literature, and has a great set of podcasts where he analyzes The Hobbit, LotR, and all of Tolkien's other works. He's also been doing free online courses going through other works of SF and fantasy, like Ender's Game, Dune, and Watership Down."

No but seriously this video was fantastic. Seeing Grey expand his video genres is awesome, and he is clearly passionate about this topic. Grey, could you talk more about Tolkien in the podcast? I know you think people wouldn't like to hear you ramble, but honestly as someone reading LotR I would listen for hours."

CGPGrey,2pky88,starcksjoen,17,Wed Dec 17 16:05:38 2014 UTC,Short answer: Nobody knows.
CGPGrey,2pky88,mrsix,3,Wed Dec 17 15:38:01 2014 UTC,"Slightly not as short answer: Nobody knows, but Tolkien wrote poetry about him for his kids and the put him in the Fellowship before he realized how much darker than the Hobbit it would turn out to be. Once it was in, he decided to keep it."
CGPGrey,2pky88,Graatand,6,Wed Dec 17 17:02:55 2014 UTC,"No exact explanation is ever given, but the theory that makes the most sense to me is that he is a kind of avatar of the entire natural world of Arda."
CGPGrey,2pky88,giommy23,5,Wed Dec 17 15:45:47 2014 UTC,"There's many theories, some more plausible than others, but nobody knows. Tolkien admitted to having added him in without explanation for the sake of mystery. So basically for shits and giggles and to confuse people."

CGPGrey,2pky88,MrDNL,5,Wed Dec 17 21:27:32 2014 UTC,"So where do you get your information on the other wizards? I don't recall Radagast as portrayed in the movies, which was over the top.

CGPGrey,2pky88,Ferrotype,15,Wed Dec 17 17:21:35 2014 UTC,I really hate the movie portrayal of Radagast.
CGPGrey,2pky88,denMAR,6,Wed Dec 17 16:26:30 2014 UTC,Probably my greatest disappointment (among so so many) of those movies. Radagast was always a complete naturalist badass in my mind.

Because almost nothing is known, and what we do know is contradictory. We have two different pairs of names for them, and in various texts we're told that they were instrumental in the War of the Ring, that they were killed, that they lost track of the mission and founded cults, and that they caved to Sauron and were actively helping his war effort.   Nobody talks about them, because all we know about them is that they existed, what their names might have been, and that they did... something."

CGPGrey,2pky88,aragorn407,5,Wed Dec 17 20:44:18 2014 UTC,"I am so glad you made this. Sooooo many people just don't understand. Might be worth pointing out that there were more than 14(15) Valar, those are just the ones that decided to go and explore the physical world."
CGPGrey,2pky88,vmax77,5,Thu Dec 18 03:15:34 2014 UTC,"That's actually a very good point, although I think it's one that might have been a little too difficult to make in the context of the video. And since (as far as I can recall) none of the other Valar are ever named, I think it's of fairly little consequence."

CGPGrey,2pcss4,MindOfMetalAndWheels,18,Mon Dec 15 12:50:04 2014 UTC,"Amazon should really take a good hard look at the iPod's legacy and learn a thing or two. Barring from this discussion the iPod Touch which I think is falsely categorized. The iPod was a brilliant piece of hardware that had a limited set of features but every single feature was specially crafted to make music listening simple, quick, and easy. From the integration with iTunes, the click-wheel, and great sizing this device dominated the market and never had another MP3 player come close to taking its market share.  The reason the iPod succeeded was that Apple asked the question ""How does this make listening to music better?"" about every feature on the device.   With evidence showing Millennials are out-reading other generations the fruit is ripe for Amazon to pick. They could buckle down, strip out any fancy feature and put in only the most essential and critical features to a eReader and kill the market just like the iPod did to MP3 players a decade ago. (Side note: Stripping out unneeded features like a web-browser and music player will also help drop the cost which would make purchasing a dedicated reading device easier to swallow.)  Will Amazon decide to actually take on challenge of making what people want in an eReader or will they neglect it and lose out on a huge revenue stream? My guess, they're gonna lose out."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,Jkuz,15,Mon Dec 15 15:00:04 2014 UTC,"Your choice of comparison is interesting because the iPod was a completely optimized, much beloved product which was recently killed by smartphones. I'm sill mourning the death of the ipod and not relishing the idea of paying considerably more if I want that kind of quality in a dedicated music player in the future (which is absolutely what I want) but the fact is, it stopped being competitive in today's market.   What will make a dedicated eReader succeed in a market that  killed one of the best products ever shipped by an electronics company?  I don't think the eReader market is necessarily analogous to the mp3 player market a decade ago just because it's newer--many of the influences that killed the ipod are affecting the eReader already."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,MangoesOfMordor,11,Mon Dec 15 18:02:19 2014 UTC,"Smartphones and iPods both have 8mm headphone jacks. Smart phones do not have eink screens optimized for reading. If anything, smartphones as we know them today are more of a evolution from the iPod than a separate product that replaced the iPod."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,wontooforate,3,Mon Dec 15 21:00:22 2014 UTC,"That's true, there might be more hope for a dedicated eReader than music player. It remains to be seen whether the draw of features like e-ink will be able to draw consumers away from general-purpose tablets.   It seems to me there are much better alternatives to eReaders around today than there were for ipods in the early 2000s, though. The iPod was only competing against old technology like CDs, and poor implementations of the same digital audio player concept. eReaders are competing against devices that are already widely owned, and can do the same thing somewhat less conveniently.   Maybe it can be done successfully, but I can't see it being the kind of home run the iPod was."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,MangoesOfMordor,1 point,Mon Dec 15 23:47:24 2014 UTC,"But I think you're wrong in assuming that tablets and ereaders are direct competitors. Certainly ereaders have a smaller market than tablets and that market will have some overlap. But that overlap isn't people choosing one or the other, it's people who own both because they perform completely different functions. If anything your argument would make more sense for phones taking out the tablet market (or vice versa) because at least those are similar in function and technology."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,wontooforate,1 point,Mon Dec 15 23:56:01 2014 UTC,"You could be right, I'll be interested to find out.   I should mention I haven't really used an eReader yet, so maybe that's why I don't fully appreciate the difference between one and a tablet."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,MangoesOfMordor,1 point,Tue Dec 16 00:42:25 2014 UTC,"That is probably it.  I've put mine in the hands of a lot of people who said they didn't see the appeal, most of them own some form of ereader now.  I didn't think I'd like them until my cousin showed me hers."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,wontooforate,6,Tue Dec 16 00:59:41 2014 UTC,"eReaders are in a weird spot though. Most of them have moved closer and closer to tablet-PCs, since people don't want a laptop (unless they're a writer/programmer) and smartphones are a bit small to read from.  Colour e-paper is pretty much dead before it got developed. The only niche an eReader has left is replacing physical books. The only Unique Selling Point Amazon really has is access to their catalog of books (which has gotten them into trouble with smaller authors due to price fixing and ignoring large publishers). There's the Nook and Kobo just waiting to take over - especially since Amazon only requires exclusivity for a few months.  I don't think Amazon can release an ""old fashioned"" / bare-bones Kindle again. I think they should, but I don't think they will since something like the Kobo is already doing that."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,Adderkleet,3,Mon Dec 15 15:12:40 2014 UTC,Best comment in the whole thread. Interesting fact about that millennials thing. Didn't know that.
CGPGrey,2pcss4,openmindedskeptic,1 point,Tue Dec 16 10:00:58 2014 UTC,"Idk, i'd keep an mp3 player, but I definitely wouldn't give it too much focus (like <<20% effort), if only for the sake of audiobook (and podcast) integration.  E: even the browser has its uses for things like reading wikipedia, idk but the pretense of a ""cheap dedicated device"" might actually be a hard sell for millenials."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,leadnpotatoes,108,Tue Dec 16 16:54:05 2014 UTC,"Interesting article, but my experience is different from yours at almost every point.  1) I understand intellectually why the typography is bad, but when I am reading on the Voyage (or on any of the previous models) I just don't notice it. I would obviously prefer more control over the pages (smaller margins, hypens, more font choices) as a way of getting more text on each screen, but I don't even notice the extra spaces or non-kerned fonts. The occasional giant margins used to make me crazy, but that's easy to fix in Calibre.  2) You are wildly overstating the amount of pressure needed to use the page press buttons. If you set the sensitivity to high, you barely have to touch it to change the page. With your talk of ""deforming your thumb"" you are really making it seem much harder than it actually is.  3) Love the light. No more bothering the wife when I read in bed at night.  4) Love the flat screen. No more digging to get dust out of the crannies.  In any case, if you don't like the Kindle, but you don't want to have to purchase audiobooks and ebooks separately, you should do what a lot of people do. Buy your books on Amazon and then import and DeDRM them in Calibre. This has the added bonus that you can set all your books to left justified instead of fill justified. I use calibre to full-justify the occasional left-justified book, but you could go the other way.  Love your videos. Very happy to find you on Reddit."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,FredDerfman,20,Mon Dec 15 15:13:10 2014 UTC,"This is definitely the most interesting comment I've read all day. Your points seem to be valid, and you're the first person I have ever met who prefers fully justified text."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,JulitoCG,11,Mon Dec 15 17:43:24 2014 UTC,"Its probably because it's what I am used to. Every print book I ever read had justified text. And I've been eReading since 1998 when I got my first PalmPilot. Every eReader I ever had full justified text.  Now, left justified is just distracting. Not as distracting as when you see 15 or 20 spaces when the page render messes up, but that doesn't happen very often any more."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,FredDerfman,3,Mon Dec 15 18:06:05 2014 UTC,oh man I just had flashbacks to reading survival manuals and other free books under the covers on an old Palm Pilot.
CGPGrey,2pcss4,Jotebe,1 point,Mon Dec 15 20:04:59 2014 UTC,"I agree. Let me re-emphasize: EVERY PRINT BOOK I EVER READ is like this. (Ok, yes, hyperbole. I couldn't pretend to list every book I ever read, and many kids books play with their typography. Also, Archy And Mehitabel...) Now, the failure of word-break-hyphens is an issue, but naming justification as make-or-break for your reading ability... it makes me wonder."
CGPGrey,2pcss4,jbsegal,19,Mon Dec 15 23:55:50 2014 UTC,"As I understand it, /u/MindofMetalAndWheels is opposed to full justification that's done badly.  The hyphenation engine used in LaTeX (which is someone's PhD work) is excellent and open source, so there's no justification for bad . . .  justification.   Similarly, not breaking at word-separating punctuation like em-dashes is simply bad programming.    Traditionally, the justification, hyphenation, and typesetting of books was done by hand.  It's understandable that on an e-reader this process has to be replaced with a computer algorithm.  Amazon's algorithm, as it happens, is crap.  I believe that Grey stated he'd be happy with properly full justified text, but given bad work he'd strongly prefer the ragged right."

With the exception of DRM, which is (as I understand) insisted on by the publishers, I think Amazon generally makes conscious product decisions that make for an excellent reading experience.

Import your Kindle ebooks to Calibre Once your ebooks are in the Calibre library, ""convert"" them to mobi. The converting menu has a ""look and feel"" area with alignment options. Choose ""left align"". Move your modified ebook file back to your Kindle Touch or Paperwhite (You might want to delete the old version, no automatic overwriting).

This leads to situations like the line pictured, where the ""narrator in your head"" (as he describes) would tend to voice that line as ""nevereven"", followed by a longish pause, followed by ""oncetalked"".   Partly this is due to the dashes being typeset ""closed"" — i.e., without spaces before and after them — instead of ""open"". Some style guides are beginning to recommend open setting these days, and it would certainly help improve readability in this sample.   However, even with the spaces left out, the line would still look and flow better with the left justification Grey prefers. Then, the space between ""even once"" would be smaller than the width of the em dash, and that phrase would retain its internal consistency."

This could almost be interpreted as a rebuttal to Grey's review, due to the content and timing (published 17 Dec 2014). Relevant snippet:   Amazon has actually built... a reading room somewhere at Lab126, stuffed with comfortable chairs, where pinhole cameras study the way people really read.  It’s in this room that Amazon learned people switch hands on a book roughly every two minutes, even though in surveys they claimed not to. (This is why the Voyage has identical page-turn buttons on both left and right.) The Voyage’s page-forward button is much bigger than page-back, because Amazon’s data showed 80 percent of all page flips are forward. As Green describes research like this, it seems likely that Amazon has spent more time studying the physical act of reading than any company before it."

It seems to me that you are disappointed and forgetting the downside of both conversion and the unknown. You haven't given proper consideration to the current usable values and are projecting too much value on the unknown. I just can't get past the fact that I can read my book on my phone, my kindle, my ipad and my desktop at work.  And it keeps my place (mostly). I am not an embracer of the newest & bluest tech, so I am reading on an older kindle and since it still works, I have no desire to try voyager.  But I read as often on the other devices as I do on the actual kindle hardware. I like being able to read my book where ever I happen to be when I have a linked device.  And being able to download the book to the those devices is even better.  Then I don't even have to have data connection.  I haven't tried ibooks, I imagine the same thing is possible, but if I try I it now add a level of complexity to my library that I find very very annoying.  I want one library, not 2 or 3. So, I won't give up the kindle or its offspring.  It will take a great deal more than a bad piece of hardware.  Especially since I have perfectly working pieces of old hardware."

Purchase a tree with sufficient life force that it can survive through the entire Christmas season.  Feel free to attempt to do presents.  Don't succumb to the temptation of wrapping said presents as this will decrease the efficiency of the inevitable exchanging of presents.  If this is your first Christmas with your significant other then consider hiring an impartial arbitrator to judge who is more capable of applying Christmas lights to the tree.  As Christmas approaches be sure to have a sufficient amount of podcasts and audiobooks which you can listen to during any Holiday parties, dinners, or enchanted sleigh rides.  Be sure to include a card which expresses appreciation for the recipient of any gifts which also absolves them of the obligation of reciprocation on this and any future Christmases which may come to be.  Christmas is a popular day to go to the movies.  Remember to add 12 minutes to the start of any showtimes to ensure that the spoilers for future movies have concluded prior to the commencement of pre-film credits.  Review any shortcomings to this past Christmas and adjust list appropriately."

CGPGrey,2p3qzu,JonBanes,20,Sat Dec 13 13:43:43 2014 UTC,Too nimble for brady. All that 'nimble flying' is all camerawork. The Falcon doesn't even turn in the shot.

CGPGrey,2p3qzu,Amr_E,8,Sat Dec 13 02:54:20 2014 UTC,"True, true.   But my happiest memories of it are usually when it's broken down. :)"
CGPGrey,2p3qzu,entropy-and-stardust,11,Sat Dec 13 09:07:56 2014 UTC,"also, if I am having to say to myself ""the Falcon is actually not THAT nimble, it is just the camera movement that creates the illusion"" then I don't think the film-maker is achieving their goal of having me immersed in the story? :)"
CGPGrey,2p3qzu,H__D,4,Sat Dec 13 09:58:41 2014 UTC,"While I maintain that the premise is flawed (the falcon is nimble, nothing looked nimble in ep. 4 due to vastly inferior special effects in comparison to even the rest of the trilogy and the Falcon leading the fighter attack on the 2nd Death Star proves this) the scene is out of context and the camera work may be doing the job of simply disorientating the audience during a dangerous, low altitude, high G maneuver during a dogfight. JJ can't drain the blood from your brain so he uses a camera work to try and simulate that, hardly a 'cheat'.   We'll have to see what this looks like in context but I have hope that they didn't turn the Falcon into some kind of ultimate fighting machine because I agree, the best parts were when it was broken, but even a P-51 can loose an aerilon.   God I hope I'm not burned this time. It's hard to hope for good Star Wars. We'll see. :)"
CGPGrey,2p3qzu,xSoupyTwist,2,Sat Dec 13 19:17:00 2014 UTC,Agreed.  Moving the camera is a cheat.
CGPGrey,2p3qzu,Kitworks,2,Sat Dec 13 11:23:27 2014 UTC,"Disagree - he's using the camera movement to set the mood and feel of the scene. He's not trying to make the Falcon look nimble (and the Falcon IS nimble. Brady isn't remembering the original series right on that point), he's trying to make the audience feel tense. Whether it does that job well or not is different from whether it's cheating to make the Falcon seem nimble or not."

CGPGrey,2p3qzu,spudzee111,6,Fri Dec 12 22:17:20 2014 UTC,"Yeah that's what I was thinking. Why not just stay an an older version? I haven't personally used a kindle as my main e-reader, but kindles don't strike me as a piece of tech that requires upgrading to the latest and greatest?   I've been using my iPad as my e-reader, and while I do like it, I've recently added many, many more books to my reading list. And I don't want to regret staying in the iBooks ecosystem if Kindles are a better reading sourcr, which they seem to be. I was considering one of the older devices regardless.   Edit: I jumped the gun. Listened more and Grey's complaint makes sense. A series of bad products is a bit nervewracking on the future of the company."

Of course, I can't link to it because when YouTube is the Single Point of Failure for video, once someone takes down a video, good luck finding it again.  SZA is a telegenic young black female soul singer, but she has an extremely grating California-friendly upspeak.  In the commercial, she takes photos and audio clips for Amazon Fire to identify random products and a song in the background, bothering people and getting in the way to get her photo, effectively personifying the worst habits having a smartphone gives us.  Then, there's the Amazon Echo.  Commercial:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkOCeAtKHIc  Parody:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GijLoiVkmYI  Finally, a voice activated UI for home internet which nobody wanted, featuring a single speaker, which is obviously fantastic for music.  Then there's Amazon Dash:  Commercial:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUyUNjyC6Qs  A shopping list creator with a bar code reader that's ""fun"" to use and looks like a combination dildo and Wiimote.  It seems to solve a problem of the 1950s - what to do when you run out of stuff - that we already solved in our generation.  I remember growing up and the family trip to the grocery store would be a bi-weekly or monthly thing, involving two shopping carts.  Today, everyone I know my age and younger (42) just gets stuff on the way home from work when they're out, and the era of multi-cart bi-weekly grocery store trips is pretty much a thing of the past.  Dash solves a problem that's already solved, by making it more expensive.  I could just get 3 pounds of oranges at the grocery store for $3.50, or I could get them delivered to my home and not even be able to decide whether I wanted them based on condition for the low low price of $18.  Amazon, I love you, but I don't need you to become a grocery store.  With the Echo, Fire, and Dash, Amazon's current plan seems to be ""create a dozen different items which adds some internet feature to daily life, and hope to god one of them connects with middle-class America"".  I can't wait for Amazon What - a lapel pin that narrates Wikipedia entries on request (and of course, allows you to purchase stuff through Amazon).  And then there's that ridiculous drone program.  No liability issues there, I'm sure.  http://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2014/07/11/six-things-you-need-to-know-about-amazons-drones/  Edit:  I paused the podcast and wrote this before Grey got to the Fire and Echo.

CGPGrey,2n9jsi,coolmandan03,65,Mon Nov 24 20:24:33 2014 UTC,"CGPGrey - I'm an civil engineer that works in Airport planning in the states and the UK.  I've done a ton of work at Dulles.  If you have questions, I have answers.  There are reasons for everything that is wrong there, and there are steps to fix it.  These steps are very expensive and will take time.  Ask me if you want to know."
CGPGrey,2n9jsi,Tevroc,41,Mon Nov 24 21:33:39 2014 UTC,What are the reasons for the wrongness?  I would love to know.
CGPGrey,2n9jsi,coolmandan03,109,Mon Nov 24 21:48:32 2014 UTC,"Mostly, the problems are with age and cost.  Dulles was designed and built in the early 1960s.  This was prior to airline deregulation (1978).  Prior to deregulation, if an airline wanted to fly to - lets say Orlando - the government would require that they also fly to Wichita KS and Fargo ND.  This kept most airports in check with catering to few large aircraft (A300s and 747s) and several small aircraft.  This is why large aircraft park on Concourse A/B (revamped international gates) because it was always intended for them. Dulles also incorporated a new idea of serving the passengers on these smaller flights from Fargo and Wichita.  Rather than construct a building for these aircraft to gate to, they utilized mobile lounges, where a ""bus"" could connect directly to the door of the aircraft and bring passengers to the terminal.  This was a neat idea and works well for airports with relatively low passenger numbers that aren't serving connections.   Then deregulation happened in '78 and air traffic exploded.  With new competition in the airline industry and no limits on where to fly, ticket prices fell, passenger traffic increased, and the ""hub-and-spoke"" model of most US airlines became norm - central airports with lots of capacity and good locations became places for passengers to connect.  Mobile lounges were not even close to serving the new number of aircraft, so the construction of new Concourse C/D commenced and was completed in 1985.  Due to poor insight and thought of where the airline industry may go, it was designed for the aircraft that was currently being served by mobile lounge (mostly smaller planes with little connecting passengers).  The mobile loungers were now to be used to take passengers from the Terminal to the new Concourse only. By the mid 90s it was already apparent that Concourse C/D was underbuilt, too skinny (no room passenger walkways), and too close the the existing gates on Concourse A/B - leaving for an airplane traffic nightmare.  It was also apparent that the mobile lounges would not be able to keep up with demand of passengers to/from the Terminal to Concourses C/D.  So it's the late '90s and Dulles is stuck between a rock and a hard place.  To replace the mobile lounges with an underground train, you would want to be sure the future stations are in the correct placement with the future concourses.  At a cost of $1.4 billion USD - the train just opened in 2010.  Notice the station for Concourse C is around 600' further than the actual Concourse C and passengers are required to 'walk back' to get to the gates.  This is the future planned location of Concourse C.     TLDR: The airport is extremely old and dilapidated because it was designed prior to deregulation and has plans on fixing these issues, but due to high cost - it's going to take a while (another 10 years before C/D is replaced).  Therefore, the airport does as little as possible to keep the existing C/D Concourse up and running."

CGPGrey,2n9jsi,vmax77,17,Tue Nov 25 09:19:18 2014 UTC,"Sooo, it's time to just burn it down and start over?"
CGPGrey,2n9jsi,vmax77,5,Tue Nov 25 02:07:27 2014 UTC,"Basically, that's what's planned.  Except Concourse A/B has been updated (and is relatively nice) and the Terminal is a national history building (with all kinds of special sigh lines from the roadways) - so nothing is going to happen with that, nor can they add anything directly in front of it."
CGPGrey,2n9jsi,maguxs,4,Tue Nov 25 02:37:23 2014 UTC,".Compounding the problem is the catch-22 of both passengers and airlines preferring nearby National Airport.  Flyers in the densely-populated District, Arlington, and Alexandria like the fact that National is easier to get to.  Airlines like the fact that National's cost per emplaned passenger (CPE) is $12 to Dulles' $26.  (Read more in this Greater Greater Washington article)  Also, next time you're stuck at Dulles, visit the Udvar-Hazy Center that's right next door.  You'll greatly enjoy the massive number of machines they have and nary a 10 minute drive away."

And of course I use the classic inbox, not the priority nonesense they put out recently.  One way to get around that would be to ask your recipients to add your mailing list addres to their contacts.

I think that to them it was actually just a game, a puzzle to solve.  I think because it was very well known that Grey didn't want his face known (in fact, I think I first came across CGP Grey because his face was obscured in a video another YouTuber posted on the Internet) it became a great ""Internet mystery""  It's a bit like when Doctor Who fans start gathering in forums to try and work out what the mystery of the season is, or when Lost fans were trying to piece together what was happening. It wasn't about caring what Grey looked like, it was about purely about solving the puzzle.  Of course, those taking part in it were so taken in by that aspect of it, they didn't actually stop to think that what they were doing was trying to find the face of a man who they knew wanted to remain anonymous."

CGPGrey,2n9jsi,lancedragons,8,Mon Nov 24 22:30:29 2014 UTC,"Most of Siri's language processing is done via the internet by sending what you say to Apple's servers to have it analyzed. The ""Hey Siri"" command is actually detected on the device without using the internet, but once the command is triggered Siri still sends off everything you say to have it processed. Apple's servers are more precise than the device's listening routine for the ""Hey Siri"" command, so often times if you say something that sounds like ""Hey Siri"" you will trigger the device, but when it sends your speech to be analyzed it will figure out what you actually said. Unfortunately Siri hasn't been programmed to cancel the command once it figures out you didn't actually say ""Hey Siri."""

Possibly because you obviously don't go by ""CGPGrey"" in real life, but it seems like the fleshbag ""you"" is more like a vessel that happens to carry around the ""real"" Grey somewhere inside.

How does it feel to have a persona that's important to more people than your ""true"" self is?"

CGPGrey,2n9jsi,TheRandomRoulette,17,Mon Nov 24 18:42:41 2014 UTC,"I'm somewhat surprised at Grey for using a rating system out of 10, since that splits the median and is more granular than humans can grok. Different rating scales say different things, let's count the ways:  tl;dr 5 is best, then 9, 3, 4, 10, & 2. 10 is only for counting mistakes.  5 is the best by far. A top, middle, and bottom, and halfway markers between middle and the ends. This is what everyone should use as default. 9/10 ->  5/5. 10/10 is perfect, 5/5 is anything better than just good.  Everything else in numerical order.  2 is the worst. Thumbs up/thumbs down is another form. Everything is either good or bad to you, and it's the least information you can give me about your opinion. If you ask for my opinion on something and all I have to say is ""I dis/liked it"", punch me in the face.  3 is the coarsest acceptable scale. Up, down, and neutral. Note that upvote/downvote on reddit falls here, since there is a neutral option.  4 is super interesting. Normally I'm against split medians because there's no neutral, but what this says is ""50% quality is still the lower half"", or that just being meh is actually bad. Like a scale of 5 w/o the neutral option. This where I think Grey would sit.  9 is my personal favourite. It's granular, logical, and maps onto both the 3 and 5 scales. Treat this as a scale of 3 inside a scale of 3. High, middle,and low each with high, middle, and low. Bottom of the middle? 4/9. Best of the worst? 3/9. Perfect. It also maps a 5 scale: look at your hand w/ fingers spread, count the spaces and digits to get 9. 4/5 is 7/9.  10 is meant for counting mistakes, as in fight scoring. You start with a 10, and the score goes down as things go wrong, and only goes up if a good point mitigates a bad point. This means that a thing with no special qualities at all gets a 10 if there's nothing wrong with it, where it'd get a 3/5 otherwise. Even worse is when people do partials, like 8.8/10. I say to those people ""explain how an 8.8 differs from an 8.7"" and the only rational answer is ""8.7 has one problem slightly worse or an additional minor error"". That only matters for competitions where advancement isn't a straight knockout by win/loss count, because no one really thinks in terms of a scale of 100. Note this is also how schools do their grades.  Odds and ends: If your rating system includes half-points, it actually has twice as many slots unless the minimum is 1. A scale that goes 0-10 is actually an 11-point scale, which is just insanity. The Kinsey Scale for sexual orientation uses 1-7, but is A-both-B w/ the intermediate scores being ""both, slightly more A"" and ""both, way more A"" in between exclusives. Very specific case."

Most powered speakers click fairly aggressively when switched on or off--computer speakers, for instance, do this.  Audio types don't like having extra stuff in their circuits, so there's no power cut-off when the voltage gets too low, it just dies at some point.   The QC25s click more softly as the (powered) noise-cancelling circuit is damped by the (unpowered) audio circuitry."

CGPGrey,2ms33b,theDefine,7,Wed Nov 19 16:27:51 2014 UTC,Make sure to try them out first though. Noice cancelling headphones might make it feel like you constantly have a preassure on your ears (like the one you get when you're on an airplane and it's climbing) and that's really uncomfortable. Not all people experience this but I do and I can't stand to have noice cancelling headphones on for more than 5 minutes. Instead I bought a pair that are closed headphones that passively cancel out noice instead of actively like the Bose quiet comfort do. I have pair of these and they are also great on a plane but they don't fold down as nice as the Bose ones do.
CGPGrey,2ms33b,cpcallen,10,Wed Nov 19 18:23:57 2014 UTC,Noice cancelling headphones might make it feel like you constantly have a preassure on your ears    TIL this is not how everyone experiences silence.
CGPGrey,2ms33b,icomputertinker,2,Wed Nov 19 19:18:40 2014 UTC,Now that is interesting because I had no idea that people might feel pressure when it's silent (except for when there has been a pressure change around you of course).
CGPGrey,2ms33b,SlimmestShady,1 point,Wed Nov 19 19:54:52 2014 UTC,"The alternative is extremely disquieting as well. At my lab we have noise damping panels around an exhaust stack on our roof.

CGPGrey,2ms33b,reed17,1 point,Thu Nov 20 05:01:28 2014 UTC,While I don't use very good headphones (and I mostly use ear buds) I also find the presence of headphones without sounds to be a 'pressure' rather than 'silence'.

I use the AKG K 272HD now, which seems to have much better sound quality, and is much lighter. The Pioneer set gave me headaches, being over a pound in weight. The AKG set is probably easier to break, but I suppose that's what you get for buying a lighter pair of earphones.   And of course you shouldn't try Beats.

If the metric is ""can you hear the outside world when music is playing"" then I don't notice much difference between the two in noise cancellation.   Other features of the PSB are that it can be used passively as regular headphones when your batteries die, takes a detachable cord that plugs into either side of the headphones, and includes a great cord that offers iPod controls and an external monitor so you don't have to take them off to hear someone talking to you."

CGPGrey,2ms33b,Skalpaddan,2,Wed Nov 19 23:11:35 2014 UTC,"If I'm correct, the sound cancellation doesn't actually do anything about non-static sounds. It used a microphone to listen to what going on around you, and then cancels it out with the driver. So it would reduce engine noise, but not a crying baby or talking. I work around airplanes, and some of my coworkers use sound cancelling headphones so that they can hear people speaking better, since it cancels only the engine noise.   Further, cabin engine noise is so faint (from my experience) that you would be better off buying a pair of headphones with passive sound isolation, as they would do more to block out speech and crying baby sounds. Bose don't make headphones with overly effective passive sound isolation, so they are not an especially good choice. My pair of Focal Spirit Ones can be had for cheaper, and have better sound quality, build quality, and passive sound isolation; all by a considerable margin. The audio technica ATH-m50s are fantastic, and can often be found on sale for near $100. Also better in every conceivable way than the Bose.   Tl;dr: sound cancellation is doesn't reduce crying or talking, and Bose are low quality headphones with a large price-tag."
CGPGrey,2ms33b,maninsuitcase,1 point,Wed Nov 19 22:00:40 2014 UTC,"You've pretty much hit the nail on the head.

If you travel a lot, listen to some music, audio books and podcasts, Bose is a good choice.   Are you more obsessed with audio quality and don't mind a larger pair of headphones on your head, even in public; get a pair of studio ones. Beyerdynamic dt770 pro, audio technica ath50x or similar.   The bose pair will give you the best noise canceling you can buy, but they are not a studio pair.   Also, do you just want a fashion statement and don't care about audio, noise canceling or discustingly high prices, buy Beats by Dre."

Will it muffle noise enough that if I put on a white noise/rainy noise that I might not be distracted?
CGPGrey,2ms33b,Kopratic,3,Wed Nov 19 18:03:22 2014 UTC,"So I actually have a pair of noise cancelling headphones at work for this exact reason. I gotta say having it is like a double edged sword. It's great because I definitely am much more focused and productive with them on. However, it's soooo good at blocking out noise, when I do have music on - I can't even hear the phone ringing next to me. In addition the only way a co-worker can get my attention is to tap me on the shoulder. And I work mostly on team projects so I do need to answer questions and discuss things with colleagues all the time.  So I would say - if most of the work you do is independent and you almost never have to answer the phone or pay attention to other things or people in your office - then noise cancelling headphones are perfect. Otherwise, they may cause you to miss important things, or have co-workers think you're ignoring them all the time when they scream your name."
CGPGrey,2ms33b,baudtack,1 point,Thu Nov 20 01:35:02 2014 UTC,Active noice cancelling headphones are made to block out more or less constant sounds like the humming of an engine. These will absolutely help against against people talking as well but a pair of closed headphones might work just as good and not be as expensive as the Bose ones.

CGPGrey,2ms33b,Skalpaddan,2,Wed Nov 19 19:29:59 2014 UTC,"Could be a worse choice, I suppose. From my understanding, Bose isn't bad, although rather overpriced. But they're not Beats, which aren't just overpriced, they really suck as well. They're a fashion statement, not a tool for getting sound inside your ears.   I'm a person who goes for the best within a certain budget. I told myself it was okay to spend a certain amount of money, and got the AKG K272HD, which I was told. Had a very neutral sound profile (I want to hear the sound clip the way it actually is, and I use it for a wide array of things, so neutral is good), and indeed, they really are pretty good. I'm not a true audiophile, but I do want whatever the people who know best think is great.   They don't have active noise canceling, though, which was a conscious choice for me. First of all, I wanted to be able to hear some outside noise, although preferably diminished. For example, when I'm at my desk with the window open, I want to hear if it's raining. Secondly, active noise canceling may add certain distortions to the sound, and you also pay more for the noise canceling technology, leaving less expense for actual sound quality. Assuming your dealing with certain brands (AKG, Sennheiser, brands like those) headphones without noise canceling will generally be better in terms of sound quality than an equally priced set with active noise canceling.   My set is closed, though, which still locks out a lot of sound. My brain lacks the ability to properly filter out certain signals that are deemed unimportant. As a result, I have more hearing problems than most people would have when a location is particularly noisy for one reason or another. But even so, the headphones do lock me out from the real world for a big part. An active noise canceling system should perform better in this regard, but even having closed headphones goes a long way.   I still want to figure out what IEMs I'd like. Hooking my headphones up to my phone is a bit of a pain in the ass. I think I'd go for the most neutral sounding set possible around 30 or so euros, maybe with a microphone thing on it."

I got a 4 pack of rechargeables, based on the 1st battery that will last me about a month.   The noise cancelling is excellent though. All office drone vanishes instantly. You can hear voices reasonableness well, but I can't hear my phone ring.  My co worker tried them for maybe 2 minutes before deciding to order a pair for him self.   In all 4.5 thumbs out of 5. I dock the half because the cable can be a bit short at times, and the sound quality could be better for £280."
CGPGrey,2ms33b,Holy_Jay,1 point,Wed Nov 19 20:37:58 2014 UTC,I have a set of these I bought before I took 3 flights in the last 2 months.  They were a HUGE upgrade over the in ear noise cancelling headphones I had.  Wow!  What an improvement.

CGPGrey,2ms33b,WhatIsSixTimesSeven,1 point,Thu Nov 20 01:21:07 2014 UTC,"Hi, obviously not Grey here but do have experience with Amazon referrals.  When someone visits amazon through a referral link, the referrer gets a percentage of the sale of any items purchased during the following 24 hours. The base rate is around 4% I believe. As more items are purchased during a pay period (a month I think) the percentage increases. For example, after 4 items it goes up to 6.5%.  If you've got a strong niche blog with a decent readership, it's definitely worthwhile to set it up (It is free, after all). My girlfriend recommended a set of Med Lab Science study flash cards (Around $200) and has made around $50 in referrals."
CGPGrey,2ms33b,cdine,2,Thu Nov 20 03:23:54 2014 UTC,"Here's the rundown. Fixed 4% for electronics 6% for headphones, so like $10.76 $16.14 per pair of headphones from now til a couple days before Christmas, if I'm putting it together correctly."

CGPGrey,2ms33b,MoralRelativity,1 point,Fri Nov 21 01:17:40 2014 UTC,"The link to ""wireless noise-cancelling headphones"" goes to Amazon page for QC20i. Those are noise-cancelling, but not wireless.  They work very well, though. They're not as good at noise cancelling as QC15/25, as they lack some of the passive isolation, but they are much more comfortable to wear. The ""Stay Hear+"" tips are the only type of headphones I've been able to use for extended periods of time, as I don't have to insert them into the ear channel itself."
CGPGrey,2ms33b,Gosh-Darnit,2,Fri Nov 21 12:31:41 2014 UTC,"Okay, I'm really surprised this is the only comment about the earbuds (QC20 / QC20i) - I'd been trying to find some comparative review about them vs. the QC25's for a while now, as both appeal to me for their own reasons.  Myself and a friend, who are on a work project onsite in a noisy office together, just went and each bought one pair of each. We did this because we each gravitated towards the other model, and partially to do some informal side-by-side comparison. Also Best Buy will take them back no-questions-asked until Jan 15 2015, so if we both hate them, no problem.  Initially, the QC20i earbuds (which I got) remove outside noise better. It seems like the ANC is better on them, vs. their isolation being the big factor here - turn it off, and it's plenty noisy.  He heard that there's a break-in period for the ANC on the QC25s.. but finding any real data on that is difficult, at best - /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels - do you have any feedback on that subject, after owning them for a while? It seems like crazy-talk to me, but I don't want to get in a fight with audiophiles over equipment break-in (dare you look up ""cable cooking"") in this thread, either.  I was concerned about the battery pack on the 20's being... obnoxious, and so far I would say it isn't. It can sit atop your phone in a pocket without really being noticeable at all.  So far, we're both happier in our office full of chatty people and loud air handlers."

CGPGrey,2l5bdy,-to-,7,Mon Nov 3 14:30:11 2014 UTC,"I've seen a bunch of people on Reddit arguing that it should be used rather than instant runoff   There are a number of reasons why Approval is better than IRV, including these flaws in IRV:   Voting for your honest favorite can still reduce your happiness in the election outcome (Favorite Betrayal), making naive strategy to top rank the lesser of two evils. Raising a candidate on your ballot can actually make them less likely to win (Monotonicity). A candidate can win every subset of voters (IE polling location) but not the combined election (Consistency), making it difficult to count in precincts or interpret the outcome. Voting honestly can actually be worse than not voting at all (Participation).    or even systems like MMP and STV, in national elections.   I can't speak for everyone, but the only reason I would make that argument is adoptability. Individual states can can change their single winner methods without federal action. However, they are federally required to use single winner elections in the House and Constitutionally required to use single winner elections for Senate and President."
CGPGrey,2l5bdy,Daughie8,4,Mon Nov 3 12:35:19 2014 UTC,"Just to provide further info to those who might be interested:   Voting for your honest favorite can still reduce your happiness in the election outcome   A similar problem arises with Approval Voting (later-no-harm criterion). Imagine I'm one of 100 voters, and I prefer candidates C, B, and A in that order, and Candidate B ties Candidate C. It would have been in my best interest to not vote to approve Candidate B, even though I would have honestly been okay with B being in office, because that would have gotten me my first choice candidate. Approval voting doesn't force you to betray your favorite, but it does incentivize betraying compromise candidates you otherwise approve of. Which defeats the whole point of approval voting.   Raising a candidate on your ballot can actually make them less likely to win   But in Approval, raising a candidate on your ballot can make your favorite less likely to win. The prior point is an example of this.   A candidate can win every subset of voters (IE polling location) but not the combined election, making it difficult to count in precincts or interpret the outcome.   Which might be a somewhat good thing. The less predictable the outcome of an election is, the less incentive voters have to vote tactically.   Voting honestly can actually be worse than not voting at all   The Participation criterion is failed by many voting systems, including every Condorcet method."
CGPGrey,2l5bdy,Puxington,3,Mon Nov 3 17:08:13 2014 UTC,"I'm not a fan personally, although it's still better than FPTP. The ""big party"" candidates would still always win."
CGPGrey,2l5bdy,tribesman,4,Tue Nov 4 01:28:39 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure that is true, actually. Assuming people always approve their candidate and never approve the other big party candidate, we would see the two main candidates getting ~50% approvals. A third party would need only to do slightly better than capturing half of each party.   I would certainly be harder for the little guy than STV or what have you, but still much easier than FPTP. Approval voting does handle the spoiler effect well."
CGPGrey,2l5bdy,tribesman,3,Mon Nov 3 15:01:29 2014 UTC,"Election Campaigns would be rallied around screaming, ""Vote ONLY for us. DO NOT select other options for you Children's future."" thus ensuring the most wily, and not the most deserving, wins the election each time. For the deserving one to get a chance the approval would actually be working FPTP way."
CGPGrey,2l5bdy,angelcollina,3,Mon Nov 3 15:34:19 2014 UTC,"For supporters this would be hard to control, but we could certainly amend the voter intimidation and political advertising laws to make it illegal remove negative ads. Negative ads are a natural part of FPTP because a vote for me is necessarily a non-vote for you, but in this system that isn't the case. I think there is a decent argument that running negative ads in an approval election is ""gaming the election"", in the same way that a Democrat running an ad for the second most popular Republican would be in FPTP."
CGPGrey,2l5bdy,tribesman,5,Mon Nov 3 13:53:48 2014 UTC,"In Approval you can mathematically show it is always in the voter's best interest to approve of their honest favorite. There is also never a reason to approve of B but not A if you like A more than B. Therefore, unless your favorite is a lesser of two evil, there is no reason to expect an Approval voter to select only a single candidate. See this article for more details."

CGPGrey,2l5bdy,KnightOfGreystonia,10,Thu Nov 6 21:03:10 2014 UTC,"It is easier to count and administer, but for large scale elections this doesn't matter much, you'll still use a computer even in FPTP elections.  Approval is a good, simple system, but it has one notable weakness that may cause it to degenerate back to FPTP: In the video the vegetarians obviously (based on their smile) prefer Veggie Villa above Burger Barn. If those voters are a bit more selfish they may leave out Burger Barn on their vote. That way you'll end up with a tie between Burger Barn and Veggie Villa in this case (3 for each option). If there was one more vegetarian who too would accept both options (but prefer VV over BB), and followed the same strategy and left out BB, then VV would win. Knowing that adding less preferred candidates to your vote may cause your most preferred candidate to lose is unfortunately likely to affect how people vote. STV does have several disadvantages (for instance, it would eliminate BB first in this election, even though everybody accepted that option), but not this one (which is known as the ""Later no harm criterion"").  Is this an argument against Approval? No, absolutely not! It's far better than FPTP and very viable in smaller groups/organizations. Just pointing out a weakness you should be aware of."
CGPGrey,2l5bdy,Dietcereal,9,Mon Nov 3 10:49:53 2014 UTC,"Is this an argument against Approval?   Yes, yes it is. Not in the case of ""should we use this rather than FPTP"", but in the argument of ""which voting method should we use, with everything on the table?"", this is a very strong argument against it."
CGPGrey,2l5bdy,Tiej,2,Mon Nov 3 11:50:18 2014 UTC,"I'm just trying to make people not think Approval is a bad system, while they are still aware of a weakness. It's not good if people go on believing Approval (or any system, for that matter) is a silver bullet. In 2009 there was an election for the mayor in Burlington. They used the IRV method (arguably better than their previous system, which was top two candidates in a new election if no candidate reach 40% support), but the election caused neither the plurality winner nor the Condorcet winner to be elected. The result caused some controversy, and a year later they repealed IRV in favour of the old system. I fear that if we ""sell in"" a system as ""perfect"", and there is an election where a weakness of said system becomes very apparent, then people are much more likely to support a change back to the old system.

CGPGrey,2l5bdy,_RudeDude,3,Mon Nov 3 14:52:14 2014 UTC,"Is there a practical voting system that is immune from this kind of manipulation ? What do you propose to ensure that BB wins ?   If there was one more vegetarian who too would accept both options (but prefer VV over BB), and followed the same strategy and left out BB, then VV would win   In this case VV would have an absolute majority of first preferences. It would win first round in AV. I don't see how this is a bug."
CGPGrey,2l5bdy,antesignanus,2,Mon Nov 3 15:40:33 2014 UTC,"Is there a practical voting system that is immune from this kind of manipulation ? What do you propose to ensure that BB wins ?   Well, FPTP actually is immune as you can only vote for one option, but obviously this is not an alternative, so for your question the answer is likely ""no"". Given this example I can't think of a system that would ensure BB winning when VV voters deliberately avoid specifying BB as a [later] preference. As I wrote, I just wanted to point out this weakness and make people aware of it. Approval voting is a good, simple system, and likely one of, if not the best system to use in situations like the one described in Grey's video. In larger elections, where voters likely are more susceptible to manipulation, Approval may not be the best option (but it certainly won't be worse than FPTP).   In this case VV would have an absolute majority of first preferences. It would win first round in AV. I don't see how this is a bug.   It's not given that the majority of first preference is the outcome that maximize voter satisfaction. Maximum voter satisfaction is generally what modern voting systems strive to achieve. One rather peculiar thing is that ""majority"" isn't always entirely clear. Both Condorcet methods and AV/IRV meet the majority criterion, yet they may end up with different winners!"

I don't know, it just sucks to hear people bashing YouTube for no longer doing something when there's a prominent page dedicated to that exact function."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,Zagorath,14,Sun Nov 2 23:49:16 2014 UTC,"I use it pretty regularly. The first time I go to YouTube on any given day, I'll go to the subscriptions page and watch through my subscription videos, but once they dry up I find the What to watch page often has pretty good stuff.  I've even found one or two channels that I subscribed to because of it, though more often it's one off things."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,After_Dark,10,Tue Nov 4 08:39:32 2014 UTC,"And this is almost certainly how YouTube intends these pages to be used, one to watch known channels and one to find new stuff."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,Zagorath,8,Mon Nov 3 00:39:04 2014 UTC,"I just wish they gave me the option to set the subscription page to the default. Or even have both on the home page, side by side.  I rather liked the old system, to be honest. A quick view of the most recent subscription videos at the top, with a button to view a stream of all your subscription videos. Below that, a few ""recommended videos"" with a button to see more recommended videos."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,After_Dark,4,Mon Nov 3 00:51:53 2014 UTC,"This is an incredibly valid point, while it's great that there is still a My Subscriptions page, I too wish I could set it as default. I visit the page so much that typing 'y' into chrome immediately brings up a link to that page. Not to say I don't like the What to Watch page, it certainly has helped me find videos to watch on slow days, but I'd really like the option to change the default."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,j0nthegreat,2,Mon Nov 3 00:57:34 2014 UTC,this is my experience as well
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,blatherlikeme,8,Mon Nov 3 01:11:16 2014 UTC,"You are still not getting them all.  I do the same thing, but I have just discovered that I'm not getting all of those videos either when I compared them to my RSS feeds of the channel.  Which seems VERY unfair to creator and very annoying to me."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,trlkly,12,Mon Nov 10 18:08:32 2014 UTC,"As I said, I occasionally check if I got every video of the week prior to checking for a bunch of different channels. Also I watch a lot of channels with a regular schedule that is pretty easy to check or to notice a missing video. Daily videos, weekly videos, videos every X days, etc. And whenever I feel there is a video missing I check that channel. I have not yet found a missing video.  It's not impossible that I have indeed missed out on videos because of youtube, but so far I can't confirm the claims made by many users. For me(!), it works."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,Arcelebor,3,Sun Nov 2 23:54:12 2014 UTC,"I do. It's good for finding similar videos to the types I already watch. Plus, for a lot of shows, you don't want to subscribe, because it means you'll be shown all their shows, when you only like one.  For a little while, YouTube had a way to define a show and subscribe to it, but now, about the only thing you can do is use a playlist.  For example, I only like Zero Punctuation, so I'm not going to subscribe to the Escapist."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,sparkypchu,2,Mon Nov 3 00:03:20 2014 UTC,"I came to this thread to post exactly this point.  I am glad to see that many other users are unaffected by any moderating YouTube does by using the subscriptions page.  I also only use the subscriptions page, having saved that as my bookmark.  I suppose the question is whether an ""average"" user is aware of that option?"

CGPGrey,2l3h3i,obnoxious_banana,2,Sun Nov 2 21:13:09 2014 UTC,Don't know but I have found no better solution. It is just a button in chrome that drops down with all my feeds. It automatically detects sites with rss feeds so I can add a feed with 3 clicks and just gives me a simple unread counter (Similar to the counter you can see in adblock). It doesn't give me notifications and it only tells me when there are updates when I can read them; while browsing. It always pushes the last posted one to the top though and I am rarely in the view I posted. That is only if I want to find something specific. I usually go to the general feed where it merges everything.  http://puu.sh/cBQXh/956d89a38a.png  http://puu.sh/cBRdb/4437fc3d69.png

CGPGrey,2l3h3i,scarfaceDeb,15,Mon Nov 3 18:02:50 2014 UTC,"So Grey, how do you use Youtube if you aren't subscribed to anyone? You can't possibly check every channel you're interested in individually, that would be horribly inefficient."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,Darth_Hobbes,17,Mon Nov 3 01:49:36 2014 UTC,"In regards to Google Inbox, you can disable the ""bundle"" feature to make it still function like a regular email inbox. I think the interface strongly encourages the ""Inbox Zero"" philosophy that Grey mentioned in #6.  Calling it the ""Facebook of email"" is a bit of a stretch. That kind of suggests that you might miss random emails if google deems them unimportant (not counting spam)."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,JeffDujon,7,Sun Nov 2 23:40:23 2014 UTC,"""facebook of email"" is a serious stretch. You still get all of your email in your inbox its just does smart stuff about how you see your email.  Including cool stuff like 'only show me this sub folder once a day' which does great stuff like keep all those crap promo emails out of your face most of the day.   Its one of those 'you won't get it until you try it for a couple of weeks' at which point you won't go back.  Its @gmail.com and chrome only for the moment, if anyone wants an invite let me know, I have a couple."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,Darth_Hobbes,3,Mon Nov 3 05:10:51 2014 UTC,"Grey, I think Inbox would be something for you. At the start I had the same thoughts as you did and all the information that are on the outside point in that direction, but after using it for a few days I really like it.  Especially I like that you can let mail come back to an Inbox at an other moment and one feature I think grey would use regularly: you can make filters, that the mail in one folder (nothing else are the bundles) only shows once a week or similar. So you can for example say, the mail from Brady I only want to read on every other sunday eve."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,Xavi-avi,3,Wed Nov 5 16:05:23 2014 UTC,"I agree. Inbox doesn't facebookize the gmail, but makes it more streamlined, with a couple of nice features like snooze (like show me this message tomorrow when I'll have the time).  Also, I have noticed that I make less clicks to do most used actions like archive, go to next bundle when the current one is empty, etc.  I personally hate when some algorithms choose for me what kind of information is suitable and interesting (except spam filters) and Inbox doesn't trigger that hate at all."

I think it should also be noted in this thread that the Senate is on a six year rotation is so that ever-other election for a seat is held during a Presidential election year.   Look at the late Senator Ted Kennedy who was first elected to a full six year term in November of 1964 as a part of ""Class 1."" 1964 was a Presidential election that saw President Johnson beat Goldwater. Kennedy's second election was then the mid-term election of 1970. And his third election in 1976 for the Presidential headliner of Carter v. President Ford."

CGPGrey,2l3h3i,JeffDujon,17,Wed Nov 5 19:48:09 2014 UTC,"Australian here (Compulsory voter)...  Brady and Grey were both seriously mistaken in the characterization of compulsory voting; it is not a question of democracy.  Forcing people to vote is a freedom of choice issue, NOT a democracy issue.  Democracy by its very definition 'Demos' is 'rule by the people.'  Compare this against the turnout in US Presidential elections 1932-2012 which averages out to 59%  How can this be represented as rule by the people? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout_in_the_United_States_presidential_elections  This means that in 2012 90 million people did not participate in rule by the people.  The problem with this is both parties know this is the case and effectively govern only for those who turn out.  They know very well what the average non-voter looks like and feel comfortable targeting cuts and policies which can make their lives harder.  They hit these people because there are no ramifications.  An example of this is US prison reform.  Why reform when you are only helping a constituency which either doesn't vote or is ineligible to vote.  I further suggest this flows to the polarization of US politics.  When you have to please the majority of the population, you are far more considered in how you govern.  That really has been the Australian experience.  The extremist ends of politics get reigned in because you have to govern with the will of the people."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,Tao_McCawley,3,Mon Nov 3 23:57:18 2014 UTC,"That really has been the Australian experience. The extremist ends of politics get reigned in because you have to govern with the will of the people.   Of course, this has a pretty vicious corollary - the two parties converge until you're left with a ""beige dictatorship"". The talking heads get swapped out from time to time, but very little actually changes, and many of the changes that are effected have nothing to do with the will of the public, and everything to do with being contrarian.  Don't get me wrong - I think compulsory voting is better for our country than the alternative. I just happen to think that our system is due for massive reform. In particular, we need to acknowledge that basically nobody is voting for their ""local representative"" - they're proxy voting for their preferred PM. Ditching the house of reps in favour of a more proportional representation system would be a good start."

First and foremost reason is that nobody has an RSS reader breathing down their throat. When Firefox and Google started killing their own syndication products and Apple / MS never adopted them in the first place, it was a death sentence from the get go because people are not going to use tech that does not work out of the box.  If Android, Windows, Chromebooks, etc all came with a feed handler app that would show up next to your email client or even within it, and whenever you clicked the subscribe buttons on various pages it would pop up in said reader, the UX would be perfect and everyone would be using it.  So in the end, it is the faults of all those that ship email clients with their OS (everyone) and not feed aggregators (everyone). Your browser can interpret and handle mailto and rss in the exact same way, the UX can be the exact same, and we could all be happy happy joy joy using rss (like I do for everything) like we should be.  Just for a frame of reference, if you click an RSS icon in Kubuntu on a fresh install it pops up in Akregator immediately and you just pick a group to put it in and view at your leisure. And Akregator shows up as a tab in Kontact, next to your calendar and email inbox, so it is a true first class citizen. And surprise, the UX is good. Now to just get Kubuntu on everyones personal computers when they buy them..."

In particular I'm surprised Brady never brought it up during those discussions since the primary point of controversy seems to be that other countries in the world keep mixing up the NZ and AU flags at official world gatherings. Of the proposed options, I like the silver fern flag and can see why it's popular locally. The Hundertwasser flag is a bit too abstract. If they wanted to keep color continuity, the Kyle Lockwood flag feels like the right direction though a bit busy. Perhaps if they had just the white fern with the top left field in red and the bottom right in blue, though..."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,Boingboingsplat,4,Mon Nov 3 17:59:52 2014 UTC,"I couldn't agree more with Grey that the fundamental problem with the US is the voting system. It annoys me so much that NOBODY seems to acknowledge this. People like Cenk Uygur or Sam Sedar will constantly criticize Ralph Nader for running and spoiling the election, but they won't make a peep about the voting system that makes his candidacy a problem.  Instead of changing the voting system which could be done on a state by state basis, they talk about getting a constitutional amendment to get money out of politics which is much, much more difficult. It would be much easier and quicker to work on both changing the voting system and then working on a constitutional amendment than just focusing on the constitutional amendment. We could also mitigate the problem of gerrymandering and money in politics if we replaced party primaries with a single non-partisan primary that used approval voting. The two most approved candidates would move on to the general election. This would ensure that all districts are competitive while also getting rid of the spoiler effect. It would also pave the way for powerful voting blocs to form around advocacy groups. In order to be competitive, candidates would have to win the endorsement from as many popular voting blocs as possible – even if it means alienating big donors."

I did not vote until after I bought a car. But, I have recently moved to Washington and was surprised when my ballot just showed up in the mail.

CGPGrey,2l3h3i,ralfharing,4,Sun Nov 2 22:09:41 2014 UTC,"Compulsory voting is a very interesting topic for me. Here in Brazil, voting has basically no requirements, as long as you're 16 years old (or older) you can vote and from 18 on it's compulsory until you're 70.  Aaaaand... That really raises some (possible) issues in 3rd world countries. A big chunk of people is deeply misinformed during elections, especially when the parties are as vicious as they are here. They go down any route to win, from attacking the other candidate personally to making unjustifiable threats about removing/dampening social policies (which, again, are way bigger a deal in 3rd world countries.)  I do believe that my country's current state of afairs is a direct result of the way parties abuse the voting system, compulsory voting playing a big role in that. Not many people are informed about or interested in politics, but since voting is an obligation you can clearly see how manipulation of the poor and the uneducated maintains the status quo,  for better or for worse, and in a country where a cycle of oligarchical pseudo-democracy followed by dictatorship has been going on for more than a century, I really think it is for worse."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,Flieg,3,Mon Nov 3 01:52:32 2014 UTC,"I hear this argument often about un-informed voting. The only truly un-informed vote is people who don't vote or purposely informal vote (donkey vote).  People vote because of their own belief system which tell them what is important.  For some that will be macro economic policy.  For others it will be the cost of beer and cigarettes or merely that they support a certain party.  None of the reasons people vote the way they do is invalid. They may not have all of the information, but if that is the case it is up to the politicians to make the sell and get people to change their minds.  Once you start drawing lines around levels of education for who can vote you begin disenfranchising people and you no longer live in a democracy."
CGPGrey,2l3h3i,hj1221,2,Mon Nov 3 03:31:08 2014 UTC,"informal vote (donkey vote)   Not the same thing. An informal vote is a vote which, for whatever reason, is invalid. Maybe you drew a picture of a penis on the ballot paper and handed that in, maybe you numbered 1, 2, and 6, or (in Australia) failed to number every single candidate.  A donkey vote is numbering candidates 1, 2, 3, etc. in the order they appear on the ballot paper. Because it could theoretically be the way the voter actually preferred the candidates, it's counted as valid, even though most of the time it's a result of someone not caring who their vote goes to."

CGPGrey,2l3h3i,zehdeh90,2,Mon Nov 3 14:34:13 2014 UTC,"I think the problem is that the traditional UX of feeds is go to website with feed -> click RSS button -> something opens with RSS capabilities -> subscribe, and then go to the later to view in the future.  If you treat feedly like twitter anything even remotely popular is going to show up in searches when you look for people to follow on it.  And I see a tangible UX benefit when, if you can either have your browser successfully automagically associate feedly with RSS, or install an extension that does so, you can just click a button on a site and follow the content in feedly, versus having to follow twitter profiles or send a verification email to and from a mailing list."

If you just change the word ""Spatial"" to ""Ideological,"" you get the U.S. party system lol. You're holding the ideological center of your country in order to keep a Nash Equilibrium. However, because a nation's Ideological center changes over time, a successful party will change in order to keep that equilibrium (or better). That seems to be where the U.S. Republican party is failing, while the U.S. Democrats are being quite successful. No one totally agrees with either party, but if you manage to get 55% of the country to agree with 55%+ of the party's platform, you'll win the major elections pretty easily (unless someone rigs the system, like through gerrymandering).

CGPGrey,2l3h3i,BoxBopChallenge,2,Wed Nov 5 03:40:45 2014 UTC,"Sir,  it isn't true that, for the Single Transferable Vote to work, every voter has to rank each and every candidate, down to the bottom. With STV each voter implicitly gets n(n+1)/2 votes where n is the number of candidates. The top ranked candidate gets n (implicit) votes, the second gets n-1 (implicit) votes and so on. Any candidates not ranked explicitly share the remaining (implicit) votes evenly.  For example, with 5 candidates a voter has 15 implicit votes. Consider only 3 candidates are chosen: No. 1 gets 5 votes, no. 2 gets 4, no. 3 gets 3. The remaining two candidates get 1.5 votes each.  It is even possible for a voter to tick both a complete list of candidates (i. e. a party) and individual ones from the list or from other lists. Individual candidates chosen get their respective (implicit) votes, the rest of the votes are shared among the candidates from the chosen list.  PS: It is even possible for voters to cross out candidates on the ballot paper if they don't want them to get a share of the remaining votes. German local elections work this way, at least where I live …  PPS: You've got to get that point back on your score board, Grey."

Usually I don't even have to do that, since I have my browser set up to open the same tabs I had in the previously closed session, so ""my subscriptions"" is already open and all I have to do is press F5 and never see the videos Youtube suggests. I always open links in separate tabs, so I always have a Youtube subscriptions tab open.

In America and other countries that drive on the right I noticed I was having a much smoother time navigating crowds because everybody seemed to naturally gravitate to the right hand side to avoid a collision.  This leads me to believe that driving on the right might truly be the ""right"" way to drive.  The rest of the US' systems are still fundamentally stupid though"

One of the candidates, you can't just stop when you want your vote to be exhausted.﻿"
CGPGrey,2kidd7,the_excalabur,22,Tue Oct 28 00:13:01 2014 UTC,"The Australian senate does STV in the worst possible way. (Though still better than FPTP, obviously) They are what I had in mind when I mentioned reasonable elections."
CGPGrey,2kidd7,Zagorath,3,Tue Oct 28 07:11:06 2014 UTC,"I agree that the way we have it set up is terrible, but I don't think the fact that there are lots of candidates is a bad thing. Any system can have a lot of people decide to run, and that'll result in enormous ballot papers.  The problem we have is the required complete numbering, and the Group Voting Tickets that came about to make things easier. I mean, I suppose it's possible that it was these GVTs that resulted in a lot of parties deciding to register in the hopes of getting a few votes, but I still don't think it's particularly a bad thing if there were 3-4 times the number of candidates as places, rather than the just over 2 times that you suggested. (It means you can have at least a couple of significant third parties, as well as some minor parties & independents.)"
CGPGrey,2kidd7,A_guy_named_Tom,3,Tue Oct 28 07:48:21 2014 UTC,"The GVTs lead to the large voting paper, not the other way 'round.

The fact that the party controls the GVT is incentive to have one.

CGPGrey,2kidd7,the_excalabur,3,Tue Oct 28 08:02:10 2014 UTC,"The GVTs lead to the large voting paper, not the other way 'round.  The 'large' voting papers that existed before GVT introduction were much, much smaller than those today.     Can you show a causal relationship between those two? It could equally be the fact that the population has grown and there is more knowledge of and involvement in politics today. I don't think I've ever seen any evidence to suggest that the GVTs are the reason ballot papers are so large.   The fact that any party needs three candidates to get a GVT is problem one.  The fact that the party controls the GVT is incentive to have one.     Agreed   Compulsory numbering combined with the declaration of informality if you fuck up even a quite small amount is a terrible combination.  Just count the ballot until the fuckup occurs! (if you get 92 on your ballot more than once, who cares?)   Agreed. Or, just remove compulsory voting altogether, and expire the vote when the numbers run out.    I kinda wish you could number some of the boxes ""last"", ""last -1"" and so on.  There are parties I'm indifferent to, and then there's parties I'm actively hostile to.  I'd like to not have to number the 50 people in the middle to get to the latter.   Why? The way the system works, there would be no point to this. You should only need to number your preferred candidates. Once that's done, your vote expires. There's no mechanic in STV or any other common voting system for a ""negative vote"".     Personally, I'd like to see optional preferencing and above the line preferencing. A party can register it's GVT, but it would only contain an ordered list of its own candidates. Numbering above the line would place that party's candidates in your total vote.   For example, say this is the set-up on the ballot paper:    Labor Liberal Greens Other    1. Kevin 1. Tony 1. Christine Bob   2. Julia 2. Joe 2. Scott Clive   3. Bill 3. Malcolm      I could number each candidate individually below the line, as I like, e.g.  1 Christine, 2 Scott, 3 Kevin, 4 Julia, 5 Bill.   I could vote above the line, by going:  1 Greens, 2 Labor.   Which would be the same as above.  Or I could even mix and match the two, for example:  1 Greens, 2 Clive, 3 Labor.   Which would be the same as  1 Christine, 2 Scott, 3 Clive, 4 Kevin, 5 Julia, 6 Bill.   As far as I can see, such a system would vastly improve what we currently have. It'd still have the convenience of not having to number huge numbers of candidates, but would offer maximum control over where your vote goes. It would also remove the ability of minor fringe parties to get in by directing tickets into them and receiving a few from surplus votes."
CGPGrey,2kidd7,Zagorath,2,Tue Oct 28 08:35:17 2014 UTC,"I totally agree that the voting system you have described is superior. Moreover I think it WOULD result in smaller ballot papers because it would make it effectively impossible for people like Glenn Druery to corral a whole bunch of ""micro-parties"" into a preference deal system that, under the current system, effectively works as a lottery. If the system were changed such that these parties actually had no hope of winning a senate seat then I expect they would not bother entering in the first place. The Senate ballot paper would look more like the ballot papers for the House of Representatives with at most maybe a dozen parties (although usually less than half a dozen) being represented."
CGPGrey,2kidd7,ClitDoctorMD,2,Tue Oct 28 08:50:44 2014 UTC,"The causal relationships is in the herding that you mentioned.  There's a huge incentive to run a minor party because you get to submit a GVT. Heck, that's even more incentive to run like ten of 'em--which is partly what's going on.  You run a bunch of parties that attract the above-the-line votes of poorly educated voters and then preference all of the cabal highly.  There's also no reason that a minor party like the.. I dunno, shooters and fishers.. should run three candidates.  That just about triples your ballot right there.    The reason I want to be able to number from the bottom is that I prefer some candidates that I know nothing about over candidates that I know something about.  Rather than numbering a bunch of candidates in the middle at random I'd like to have some scheme for those choices.    Another alternative that is fairly reasonable is to allow both below the line voting with optional preferencing and above the line voting.  If your BTL preferences are exhausted, default to remaining choices on the GVT. \hline  In general, SVT systems don't see explosions in the number of candidates the way Australia has.  Therefore, something unique about the Aussie system is the cause of it.  The most likely candidate is the GVT, which is also unique to Australia.  Compulsory voting (not preferencing) is also a factor, likely."

Rather than numbering a bunch of candidates in the middle at random I'd like to have some scheme for those choices.   But the thing is, numbering them will have absolutely no effect mechanically. There's absolutely no point to doing this. If you haven't numbered those in the middle, your vote will be exhausted before it gets to the negative numbers. I can understand wanting to do it for the satisfaction of it, but there's no mechanic in the voting system to deal with it."
CGPGrey,2kidd7,ClitDoctorMD,7,Wed Oct 29 07:49:07 2014 UTC,Wow that sounds extremely annoying. In Ireland we can stop our preferences when we want which seems to more humane option - also saying that we dont have the sheer number of candidates you have either.
CGPGrey,2kidd7,aldonius,3,Tue Oct 28 00:59:48 2014 UTC,"My state's elections allow this, but yeah, unfortunately, for federal elections, if you want to choose where your vote goes, you have to do that.  We have the option of voting ""above the line"", where we simply put ""1"" next to our preferred party and nothing else (and most people do this). The problem with this is that it means our preferences are distributed exactly how that party wants, which isn't always in the voter's best interests. It was by manipulating this system that a member of the ""Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party"" got elected at the last election, despite getting just 0.5% of the primary vote."
CGPGrey,2kidd7,oln,3,Tue Oct 28 01:13:38 2014 UTC,Wow that really sucks but as a huge STV fan if say that is an issue based on the implementation of STV rather than the system itself. No system is perfect and even under normal STV rules freak results can happen but hey it's better than the FPTP alternative. A similar freak result hit national headlines here in Ireland years ago when our incumbent Prime Minister Bertie Ahern's running mate get elected based off his surplus from his massive personal vote. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprian_Brady

CGPGrey,2kidd7,Pie-jacker875,2,Mon Oct 27 23:07:09 2014 UTC,"California has 53 districts from which 1 representative is elected. One way the they might try the STV would be to create 10 districts that have 5 or 6 seats each. Based on Grey's numbers, I would expect 10 to 15 candidates to run. The two major parties would probably field a number of candidates equal to the number of seats. Any more and they risk vote splitting (which isn't that bad in STV, but could have negative consequences). So you'd have 5 Reps, 5 Dems, and probably 5 candidates from other parties in a typical district. At first that seems like a lot but consider that you'd probably have 5 candidates in each of the 53 districts, for a total of 256 candidates, STV would bring that down to only 150 ish."

CGPGrey,2kidd7,IrascibleCockswaine,2,Tue Oct 28 09:42:35 2014 UTC,"It's a somewhere thing.  The exact rules for in a few cases vary from system to system:   What happens when a vote is eliminated due to there not being any more preferences Exactly how surpluses are calculated If a vote transfers to someone who has already been elected, what happens?   For the first case, the quota may be recalculated, or not (most real systems recalculate quota, I think the Irish system doesn't).  For the second case, do you randomly select whole votes and leave others behind (Ireland), or do you transfer at fractional value (all other systems); also, is the surplus just composed of the votes that transferred in to get over the quota (Ireland, ERS97), or of all the votes including the ones that were there before (Gregory, Meek, Warren).  For the third case, do you just transfer through (Ireland, ERS97, Gregory) do you recalculate the fractional value of the surplus that was transferred away and add this vote into the surplus so it gets a fractional value (Meek, Warren).  Note that ERS97 and the Australian Hare-Clark are very similar; Gregory is used in Scotland.  The system I call ""Ireland"" is the one used for TDs; other Irish elections use fractional transfers, as do all STV elections in Northern Ireland - the system in both cases is similar to ERS97.  ERS97 is the system in ""How to conduct an election by Single Transferable Vote"" (3rd Edition, London 1997) published by the Electoral Reform Society."

Also, I don't quite understand what happens to second (or third, etc.) votes go if they were for a candidate that has already passed the threshold.

CGPGrey,2kidd7,Zagorath,3,Mon Oct 27 23:18:15 2014 UTC,I still don't understand why the last place candidate gets eliminated each round. What if every single Tiger voter chose Snake as their second pick?   The last candidate gets eliminated after all the available votes have been redistributed. At that point they cannot get elected. So to continue the process they are removed. Grey only showed this process by eliminating one candidate per round. However in some STV countries (such as my own in Ireland) two or more can be eliminated if all the transfers from the first eliminated candidate wouldn't have brought them up to a certain threshold. In Ireland this threshold is 5% which is the point at which their election expenses are saved.  As for where do the votes go? They continue down the list. So if your candidate is eliminated/elected they look at your voting card and see who number two is and give that vote to them. If your number two has been elected/eliminated already they look at your number 3. That continues until either you havent put any more preferences down (i.e. the vote couldnt go to any of the ones you had down as they were eliminated/elected) or they find a suitable preference.

CGPGrey,2kidd7,Zhaey,2,Tue Oct 28 00:16:29 2014 UTC,"It varies country by country. The most common way is to take all the votes and county all the 2nd preferences and divide them proportionally. So say for simplicity sake you had 100 surplus votes (thats what they call the extra votes if a candidate has reached the threshold/quota). Also for simplicity the election threshold was 1000 votes. You count the 2nd preferences and find that 300 people wanted candidate A, 200 wanted B, 400 wanted C and 100 wanted D. Those votes are then represented as a percentage i.e. in this case A 30% B 20% C 40% and D 10%. You then divide the surplus votes by this percentage so out of the 100 surplus votes A gets 30, B gets 20, C gets 40 and D gets 10. Although as Grey explains in his video some votes may be non-transferable which I didnt take into account for simplicity's sake.  In some STV systems like in Ireland a less scientific system is used. They literally take the extra votes and redistribute only them. So say the candidate have 900 votes and when they counted the last box he got 200 votes. The last 100 votes that were counted are considered his surplus and are assumed to be representative of the whole population. This redistribution isnt as accurate but is a result of our checkered past with electronic voting."
CGPGrey,2kidd7,smittyjenson,2,Tue Oct 28 01:09:13 2014 UTC,"This isn't quite true, having just read the law.  The votes are divided proportionally amongst next preferences, and then the physical ballot papers chosen are from the top of the pile for each next-preference.  This can affect the distribution of preferences the next time the distribution occurs, but is a higher-order effect.   Cambridge, mass uses a strictly-random sample of ballots to shift to their next preference.  They number the ballots as they are counted, then choose every Nth one (as appropriate) to move on to avoid biasing towards one or more ballot boxes and thus neighbourhoods while still being re-countable."
CGPGrey,2kidd7,Ramson1,1 point,Tue Oct 28 02:43:16 2014 UTC,"I would rather like to see a sort of combination of STV (or possibly some other voting system where you get to pick more than one option) and Proportional systems. I'm not exactly sure what it should look like, but I like the notion of being able to have multiple choices, rather than just one, but I also like proportional representation, as it gives a good representation of the country's first choices. However, most people don't agree 100% with one party. I voted for a party that then went on to do a lot of things I agree with, and as such I have great trust in that particular party. However, there is another that may suit me even better, and I'm considering voting for that party instead.  STV might be applicable in my particular case, as it would make voting on small fries a little safer. Now party A (the one I did vote on) will be guaranteed to get seats (there are 150, which are divided proportionally). They've always won at least a few, so they're a safe bet. However, I do really like party B, and if my vote meant they'd get even just one seat, it would be worth that vote. However, if they don't win, I'd like to support party A again. STV wouldn't really work so well, though. If you agree with party A, but a little more with B, it would work. But if there is a party C that will also get a number of seats, and you agree with A and C equally, putting A as first choice and C as second choice might make you fully support A. Although in STV, there is also the part where you divide the surplus of votes among other parties. Perhaps you could do something with that? If a party gets 10.9% of the votes, it would get 16.35 seats. Since you can't divide an individual seat, that .35 would then have to be redistributed according to their second choices. Although that thing would get rather complex and it becomes difficult to see if we're making the system more proportional to the voters' opinions, or if we're just randomising and making everything worse.  There might be another nice option, an idea that I got from a political poll. The poll asked you what you would vote if you could give 5 votes, instead of 1. I would like to give 3 to Party B, and 2 to Party A. However, this might be a difficult issue again, where people may decide that while they like two parties, they'll put all 5 votes on a single party to make that one count stronger, effectively creating a new type of tactical voting. In my case, I might decide to put all 5 votes on B, since A will earn a number of seats anyway, while B could use the extra boost. And tactical voting is exactly what you don't want.  In short, I would like to see a proportional system that takes the voter's personal ranking list of political parties into account, but I'm not sure how such a system should be implemented. The system becomes a lot more complex with such additions. I guess the easiest option for me would be to vote on the Pirate Party, and hope they'll get that 1 seat that they're slowly getting closer and closer to. I wouldn't be too surprised if they managed to get there in the next elections.﻿"

CGPGrey,2k3hmt,MarioY19,28,Thu Oct 23 14:20:55 2014 UTC,RSS does seem more appropriate for this sort of thing. I think most podcast apps are just dedicated RSS feed clients.

Many of the other sites I have been too have also offered rss or atom links when you take the time to look.  As for setting up a new rss feed (not through youtube)... a small amount of Googling makes it seem like it wouldn't be that difficult (assuming of course that the creator doesn't already have a website/host which supports rss for them).  I think it's just something that people aren't taught."

CGPGrey,2k3hmt,crousseau,5,Thu Oct 23 14:28:42 2014 UTC,"That was the hope with Diaspora. Bootstrapping a system that is so heavily reliant on the network effect is hard enough as it is. Trying to do it when there isn't one place to go for a simple sign up process (which doesn't ask you, someone who has no idea what the word ""decentralization"" even means, to try to judge which of countless hosts to trust as Diaspora did last I looked) is basically impossible. I think email's decentralization (as /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels noted) is a total accident, and would probably be hard to replicate."

Exceptions include e-mail, the web, some but not all other internet based things, and messages-in-a-bottle.  This is, frankly, why the web and e-mail are so fucking awesome."
CGPGrey,2k3hmt,JulitoCG,1 point,Thu Oct 23 22:41:50 2014 UTC,"Most Internet services rely on DNS which is distributed, but still only has 13 root servers that the entire world has to trust.  Without DNS, anything that isn't hardcoded with an address doesn't work.  For physical mail/post, it's fairly common to have UPS and FedEx pass off packages to USPS for local delivery.  So they do interact, but it's only in the direction of sending to end users.  If you shipped yourself, it would stay in the network you sent it in."
CGPGrey,2k3hmt,Lightning2112,2,Fri Oct 24 01:17:22 2014 UTC,"DNS is a big one. Most protocols on the internet (including email) depend on being able to resolve domain names into IP addresses. DNS is centralised to prevent name collisions, tampering and yet be human readable. See Zooko's triangle."
CGPGrey,2k3hmt,tfinniga,3,Fri Oct 24 01:28:06 2014 UTC,"Zooko's triangle:       Zooko's triangle is a diagram named after Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn which sets out a conjecture for any system for giving names to participants in a network protocol. At the vertices of the triangle are three properties that are generally considered desirable for such names:    Human-meaningful: The quality of meaningfulness and memorability to the users of the naming system. Domain names and nicknaming are naming systems that are highly memorable. Decentralized: The lack of a centralized authority for determining the meaning of a name. Instead, measures such as a Web of trust are used. Secure: The quality that there is one, unique and specific entity to which the name maps. For instance, domain names are unique because there is just one party able to prove that they are the owner of each domain name.   Of these three properties, Zooko's conjecture states that no single kind of name can achieve more than two. So the edges of the triangles represent the three possible choices for a naming scheme:   Decentralized and human-meaningful: This is true of nicknames people choose for themselves. Secure and human-meaningful: This is the property that domain names and URLs aim for. Secure and decentralized: This is a property of OpenPGP public key fingerprints.   Zooko's conjecture was disproved through creating practical systems that exhibit all three properties.

CGPGrey,2k3hmt,ElecNinja,15,Thu Oct 23 14:44:34 2014 UTC,This was my own understanding. Is it the case that https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions does not show all videos uploaded by your subscribed channels?

Of course the What To Watch view is noisy, spammy and almost entirely useless, and it's annoying that it's the default view and I have to select My Subscriptions every time I open Youtube. But once I've done so, I've never had reason to think until now that Youtube is missing some uploads -- of course, it's possible I wouldn't notice.  You're making a claim that Youtube has changed and that this kind of thing is now happening, making subscriptions unreliable for receiving new content as it's uploaded. How did you discover this? Is there a way to reproduce and verify the behavior?   Seems like this is a defect on Youtube's part, a serious one, something that's very much in their interests to fix."

You simply subscribe to subreddit and you get the most popular content on your front page and if you want all the content you go to the subreddit.   Grey did you consider this as an option?

CGPGrey,2jzilo,Countersync,20,Wed Oct 22 13:11:57 2014 UTC,"Yes, it's using the fraction of total second-choices, and applying that to the amount that went over.

Should there be a similar situation for their second choice candidate the procedure would continue to proportionally split their winning choice."
CGPGrey,2jzilo,Daughie8,105,Thu Oct 23 00:58:06 2014 UTC,"Great video CGP, although I'd like to see you go a bit more in depth on Condorcet methods once. Until then, here's a thought for you:  3 animals are to be elected using STV, here are the votes:   23%: Tiger>Lion>Giraffe 25%: Monkey>Lion>Owl 5%: Lion>Tiger>Tortoise 10%: Tortoise>Lion>Giraffe 19%: Giraffe>Lion>Monkey 18%: Owl>Lion>Giraffe   None reach 33%, Lion with only 5% is removed and votes goes to Tiger who now got 28%. Still none above 33%, Tortoise with 10% is removed and since Lion also is gone the votes goes to Giraffe (now at 29%). Still none above 33%, Owl is removed, votes can't go to Lion and instead go to Giraffe (now at 47%). Since there are only 3 candidates left (Giraffe, Tiger, Monkey) and 3 seats to be filled, those 3 candidates win.  Fair, right?  Well, let's take a deeper look at the votes. Notice how Lion is ranked as first or second preference on every single vote?   77% would rather have Lion than Tiger. 75% would rather have Lion than Monkey. 90% would rather have Lion than Tortoise. 81% would rather have Lion than Giraffe. 82% would rather have Lion than Owl.   The majority supports Lion over any other candidate, yet Lion is the first to be excluded!  STV is far superior to plurality voting, but it still has some flaws. Every single voting method has flaws (Arrow's impossibility theorem, for the especially interested), some more serious than others. So I guess my point is, be careful not to make STV appear like a silver bullet. It is not, and there are lots of problematic implementations of STV/IRV style voting methods (see for example Burlington IRV and the election back in 2009). In my example above I transfered votes to the third preference when the second preference was excluded, this is actually a flaw that can be used by voters to increase their vote strength, although there are fixes for this problem.  Sorry for the long rant (and I hope I didn't mess up the example in the hurry), but I hope CGP at least finds it somewhat interesting."
CGPGrey,2jzilo,hroafelme,18,Wed Oct 22 13:23:33 2014 UTC,"Every single voting method has flaws (Arrow's impossibility theorem, for the especially interested),    Well, that's only if you require people to rank the candidates. Range voting and approval voting (which are essentially the same) dodge this by allowing you to 'mark' candidates instead. However this makes it harder to get proportional representation."
CGPGrey,2jzilo,MajinJack,13,Wed Oct 22 15:28:46 2014 UTC,"Hi!  I'm glad you brought up range voting and approval voting. These are interesting voting systems that will do a good job in many elections, but there's an unfortunate feature of both these systems that people should be aware of (I'm sorry about the wall of text again, I added a TL;DR, I'm not nearly as good as CGP to explain this stuff):  TL;DR: Approval voting good, range voting fair, reweighted range voting not so good. Voting for later preferences may hurt your first preference in both systems (generally considered as a bad trait).  TS;DR:  Consider an election with 3 candidates, one winner. Let's use the traditional ""left-right"" axis (which is a very misleading way of simplifying politics, but that's another discussion) and say that you got one (L)eft candidate, one (C)enter candidate and one (R)ight candidate. Both Left and Right supports obviously prefer their own ""side"", but some of them accept the Center candidate as well (it's for sure better than the candidate on the wrong side winning!). Center supporters are fairly evenly split between Left and Right, and some only support their own candidate.  Come election day, pre-polls show a very close race between all candidates. Since as you point out that these systems are very similar, I'll only make an example with the simpler system (approval voting).  You have acquired a superpower, you know what everyone else is going to vote and you have the power to influence your closest friends to vote differently (granted, a pretty useless superpower, but you'll need it for the sake of my argument!). This is how everyone else but you will vote:   30 voters vote for L. 20 voters vote for L and C. 11 voters vote for C. 20 voters vote for R and C. 30 voters vote for R.   Let's say you and your friends prefer candidate L, but you all really despise R, so you'd want to put down L and C on your ballot to prevent R from winning. But if you do this, then C will win by one vote. On the other hand, if you persuade your friends to drop C from their ballot, then your preferred candidate will win instead!  But this is nonsense! Nobody can know the exact result before voting! True, but the knowledge that giving a vote to another candidate can cause your preferred candidate to lose may cause people to vote strategically. Voting methods is not all just math, it's a social/psychological issue that needs to be handled as well, voting systems should not appeal to strategic voting.  But, this was just a single winner election! What if there are multiple winners?  Great question! When there are multiple winners, this issue will diminish, but never entirely go away. Another issue is that approval voting will not always elect the most preferred candidates (as each candidate you vote for is weighted the same (this is not true for range voting, but more on that later)). Approval voting is however a simple and good system, if you need a voting system (for multiple winners) in an organization/group, then I do recommend it. For single winner elections I would recommend a Condorcet method, although you'll most likely need a computer to do the election.  What about (reweighted) range voting?  For a single winner election, range voting face the same problem as approval voting, giving score to any other candidate than your preferred candidate may cause that candidate to win over your preferred candidate. In a multiple winner election with reweighted range voting, things gets much more interesting. Unfortunately, not in a good way:  3 candidates, 2 winners, candidates are scored from 0 to 9. Consider these votes before your vote is counted:   10 votes with score 9 for candidate L and score 4 for candidate C. 4 vote with score 9 for candidate C. 10 votes with score 9 for candidate R and score 2 for candidate C.   L and R gets a score of 90, C gets a score of 96. Seemingly it will be C and whoever you prefer of L and R that wins the election. Let's say your preference is R this time, and like the other R voters you give a score of 2 to C. The final score will be 90 to L, 98 to C and 99 to R. Clearly that should mean the winners are R and C, right?  Not quite. The winners are not elected like this in RRV, this is in fact where the ""reweighting"" comes to play:  First, R is elected as it got the highest score. Now the idea is to reweight the ballots that gave a score to R:   (unchanged) 10 votes [9 L, 4 C]: weight = 9 / (9 + 0) = 1.0 (unchanged) 4 vote [9 C]: weight = 9 / (9 + 0) = 1.0 11 votes [9 R, 2 C]: weight = 9 / (9 + 9) = 0.5   We count the votes (votes * score * weight):   R is already elected C: (10 * 4 * 1.0) + (4 * 9 * 1.0) + (11 * 2 * 0.5) = 87 L: (10 * 9 * 1.0) = 90 (wins the second seat)   There we have it, R and L wins the election! But... Wait! I wanted R and C to win! Well, then you should've given C a score of 4 (or higher). Just watch:  Instead of electing R first, C wins first round with your new ballot giving a score of 9 to R and 4 to C (L: 90, C: 100, R: 99). Then the reweighting:   10 votes [9 L, 4 C]: weight = 9 / (9 + 4) = 0.69 10 votes [9 C]: weight = 9 / (9 + 9) = 0.5 10 votes [9 R, 2 C]: weight = 9 / (9 + 2) = 0.82 1 vote [9 R, 4 C]: weight = 9 / (9 + 4) = 0.69   Counting the votes again:   C is already elected L: (10 * 9 * 0.69) = 62.31 R: (10 * 9 * 0.82) + (1 * 9 * 0.69) = 79.87 (wins the second seat)   So by voting strategically, you managed to get the result you wanted. I need to stress the importance of preventing strategic voting. People are not (always) rational, if they believe they can benefit from strategic voting, many are likely to do so. Even if the chance of an improved result is slim (similar to how people buy lottery tickets, even though the chance of winning is very low).  Edit: I need to point out that also Condorcet methods may cause your preferred candidates to lose depending on your subsequent preferences, but unlike approval/range voting the Condorcet method meets the majority criterion"

Educating people about the benefits of proportional representative systems is very important but is only the first step towards the ultimate goal of these processes actually being implemented by governments. They have been used to doing things the same way for years and have more politically charged discussions to be having rather than discussing voting and constitutional reform. Unfortunately we do not have a Queen Lion overseeing the operation our of democracies and tirelessly working to improve it for the people being represented.

Because constituencies still only elect one representative, the only time it helps is when a candidate gets their vote split in a particular constituency.  That's why the Tories campaigned against it - they have never had their vote split historically, whereas Labour and the Liberals/SDP/LDs have always been doing that to each other.  The joke's on them now that UKIP is splitting their vote...  My personal preference is MMP like the Scottish and Welsh devolved governments use, but I'd happily take STV."

What incentive do they have at all to change it?  Either things well stay essentially the same, in which case it's a low priority issue, or else it will cause change in which case the big parties will likely lose from it.    It requires a somewhat unusual situation like in the UK where there was a hung government and the party with a plurality (Conservatives) needed to form a coalition with a smaller party (Liberal Democrats) to form a majority government.  The Lib Dems made a referendum on the voting system one of their requirements and all looked well.  They then proceeded to run a terrible campaign and and as most people had no idea how any of it worked and ""one person, one vote"" sounds completely reasonable, the country voted in favour of First Past The Post (FPTP)."

Either it's ""first past the post, with all extra votes going to their second choice"" (which is what I think Ireland uses - I really should know since I live here)   or, as others appear to be saying, they look at second choices of the ""successful"" Monkey voters and split the excess proportionally. (So if ALL votes for monkey had a second choice of 50:50 Gorilla:Lion, the extra votes would be split 50:50)."

Can't get more fair than every person being allowed to delegate their vote to whoever they want.  Plus you can do away with elections by letting voters change their delegate freely.  Which shouldn't bother those that want local representation since they can just delegate their votes to the local representative they want.  There are obvious logistical problems with implementing the system but I think in general those aren't actually any worse than the ones we currently have to deal with with elections.

CGPGrey,2jzilo,JonasTorgersen,9,Wed Oct 22 13:05:12 2014 UTC,FPTP is a terrible and clunky name.
CGPGrey,2jzilo,JonasTorgersen,3,Wed Oct 22 13:07:40 2014 UTC,"STV is a fabulous system. I ran a university election using it once, where the candidate with the second most first-ranked votes ended up winning because of second ranked votes. The problem was that this was confusing, even to people on the election commission.  If people have trouble voting now in traditional FPTP elections (think Florida 2000 or Minnesota Sen 2008), how could we educate people to vote in an STV election? (Besides making every citizen watch your video.) Voter confusion can erode trust in the system just as easily as the feeling of irrelevance that FPTP creates.  Answering this is much harder than just explaining the system, I realize, but I'm curious what you think about it."
CGPGrey,2jzilo,joshuarhall,5,Wed Oct 22 19:09:29 2014 UTC,"Oh Grey, where was this five years ago? British Columbia had a referendum on STV in 2009 and it lost because most voters found it too confusing.  Here's the video the Yes side produced: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-4_yuK-K-k) Edit: grammar and added link."
CGPGrey,2jzilo,runetrantor,4,Wed Oct 22 14:29:31 2014 UTC,"Hi. Just in case this doesn't get buried, I have a few questions.    1)  Here's an easy one to start off.  You always move entire pieces of extra voting-stuff to other candidates. Does that mean that it uses the majority of second choices for the candidate that has the extra votes, or are they distributed according to how many second choice votes a candidate gets?  Like, if Tiger gets 48% of the vote and only needs 33%, and 2/3 of Tiger voters voted for Lynx as their second choice while the remaining 1/3 voted for Ocelot as their second, does Lynx get a 10% boost while Ocelot gets a 5% boost, or does Lynx get the full 15% boost?  EDIT: This question has been answered with this conversation. Thank you!    2)  You note that voters can either just vote for the candidate they want or rank the ones they'd find acceptable in order of who they'd want most to least. So let's look at a hypothetical situation:  One of Queen Lion's new regions, Avian Heights, has some really vicious politics. The prominent ethnic groups that live there, the parrots, corvids, waterfowl, and hawks, really hate each other. The parrots want to plant forests, the corvids want to build cities, the waterfowl want to steamroll all of that to maintain the ecosystems around the lakes, and the hawks eat other birds. The waterfowl aren't happy with the corvids making so many disruptive dams, the corvids aren't happy with the parrots and waterfowl getting special access to their cities' parks, and the parrots keep badmouthing the hawks. To make it worse, there have been some awful attack ads going around that make all the political candidates either loved or hated.  Here are their latest polling numbers:    Name Votes    Crow 38%   Jackdaw 1%   Swan 40%   Macaw 15%   Eagle 6%    Now, anyone with over 33% gets in, so Crow and Swan are good. Crow's extra 5% goes to poor Jackdaw, who's been the center of a lot of controversy as of late, and Swan's extra 8% goes to... nobody! The waterfowl don't like any of the other alternatives. None of them voted for anyone except Swan, because they hate everyone else.  Now here's what we're left with:    Name Votes    ✓ Crow 33%+5%   Jackdaw 6%   ✓ Swan 33%+8%   Macaw 15%   Eagle 6%   No one 13%    No one else has enough of the vote!  So, my question is, what if a lot of voters only vote for a first choice?    3)  When beginning the implementation of STV, Queen Lion makes all the ranges bigger. So, hypothetical:  Queen Lion considers three former ranges, North Monkeyville, South Monkeyville, and Gorillastan, fairly similar, since she's a cat and they're all simians to her.  Since gorillas are an endangered species, they have a lot of land but not a very large population. They consider themselves independent and have very different cultural values than other animals. In the old system, the gorillas had a representative, and so they usually could live the way they wanted without too much interference from the monkeys around them. In short, the gorillas were happy, and since the monkey districts were full of monkeys and so got monkey representatives, they were happy as well.  When Queen Lion implements STV, though, everything changes, since North and South Monnkeyville are conglomerated together with Gorillastan, forming the Combined Simian Municipality, which can now choose three representatives.  Now, the candidates look something like this:    Name Votes    Howler Monkey 35%   Spider Monkey 6%   Squirrel Monkey 20%   Marmoset 20%   Macaque 4%   Lowland Gorilla 5%   Mountain Gorilla 10%    Now, the cutoff is at 33%, which means right from the get go, Howker Monkey is good. His extra 2% goes to Squirrel Monkey, who is most like Howler Monkey and doesn't have ""Spider"" in his name. Macaque gets thrown off the ballot because no one was familiar with him anyway, and his 4% go to Squirrel Monkey. Lowland Gorilla's 5% goes to Mountain Gorilla. Spider Monkey's 6% goes to Squirrel Monkey, leaving him with 30%. Mountain Gorilla's 15% gets taken off, and let's say it goes to Marmoset, giving him 35%, and his extra 2% goes to Squirrel Monkey, leaving him with... well, I'm sure it's enough. I can't do math in my head when I have to edit a post because of my lack of understanding.  Anyway, Squirrel Monkey and Marmoset don't care at all about gorillas, and Howler Monkey is always looking for things to yell at, so the gorillas are not happy with this result at all.  So, my question is, could this type of issue be common with STV? Does the necessity of combining smaller regions into larger regions discriminate against minorities or residents of low-population rural areas?    Whoever reads this, CGP or otherwise, thanks for taking the time to read my poorly phrased, rambling questions. I hope I at least managed to add enough entertainment value to make it worthwhile. :)  EDIT: Didn't quite understand where the 33% came from until I rewatched the video (I thought it came from 100/candidates, not 100/representatives), so I fixed some stuff up."
CGPGrey,2jzilo,OrsonThinks,2,Wed Oct 22 17:22:48 2014 UTC,"Question one has a complicated answer that differs in different implementations of STV. In general, though, it's done proportionally.   Question 2 relies on an implementation Grey used that is actually not widely used. The quota is more often (number of voters/(number of positions+1)), while he used (number of voters/number of positions). Additionally, the quota is recalculated when votes get redistributed, to account for exhausted votes.   Also worth noting that here in Australia, we're required to number every single candidate, so this isn't an issue.   Number 3, no, absolutely not. In fact, it helps minorities. Because there is an increased number of selected candidates per electorate, the end results will be roughly proportional, which means you'll get more representation of minorities. Studies show more representation of women and minority races, for example, but more importantly (in a political system) minor parties are able to get in, where otherwise you tend to only see two major parties get the vast majority of seats."
CGPGrey,2jzilo,OrsonThinks,2,Wed Oct 22 21:02:28 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the answer! I honestly wasn't expecting one, but I figured I'd make a post just in case. Now I'm glad I did!   Additionally, the quota is recalculated when votes get redistributed, to account for exhausted votes.   That makes a lot of sense, thanks.   Number 3, no, absolutely not. In fact, it helps minorities. Because there is an increased number of selected candidates per electorate, the end results will be roughly proportional, which means you'll get more representation of minorities. Studies show more representation of women and minority races, for example, but more importantly (in a political system) minor parties are able to get in, where otherwise you tend to only see two major parties get the vast majority of seats.   That all sounds pretty reasonable. Of course, in the example I gave, it's pretty clear that the introduction of STV did not benefit the gorillas, but I can believe that it makes things better a lot more than it makes things worse.  You mention different implementations of STV a few times in your post - is there a site or book or something that introduces the ideas behind different implementations and the upsides/downsides of different parts of them?  Thanks again. :)"

In your example (around 5 min mark), you assume that those who voted for White Tiger all chose Purple(?) Tiger as their second choice, and that all of their ""excess"" votes therefore go to him, but this isn't necessarily true.

Which ends up in the strange situation that even if there should be only 598 representatives, there can be much more. At the moment 631. Depending on the development in the political parties, this number can become much larger.  On the other hand, it took them two tries to make a law which is    in accordance with the Constitution, after the Constitution Court cancelt the previous one (and the first one they made). So you should not expect to much."

In particular, the Fisher Bullet Space Pen is incredibly small, but when the cap is attached to the back of the pen, it becomes full sized. You'd probably have to do something similar for your stylus (although what is a stylus useful for on an iPhone?) Get a carabiner for your keys and move them to a belt loop, if you don't have many keys. Get a smaller wallet. This is especially feasible if your wallet mainly just contains cards; there are a number of minimalist wallet solutions available; the one I ended up using was the TGT 2.0, which was based off using a rubber band (and is generally only useful for keeping your cards together). But of course, you have to pick one that works for you, and none of them will hold coins, and most don't hold bills well either.   I also wouldn't really trust those door locking / unlocking apps; they're generally finicky and require trading security for minor convenience. Not to mention what happens if your phone gets stolen.

CGPGrey,2ivy8a,trlkly,5,Fri Oct 10 22:30:02 2014 UTC,"A few comments (mainly for Grey; sorry Brady! YNWA):  1a. Get a smaller wallet, or a wallet cover for your phone (I have one for my android, made by Otterbox). 1b. Get a key fob. It's multi-use: when I can't have a phone on me because of work, I put my pocket watch on there (it's less obtrusive than the chain). 1c. This one will be SO much fun for you, Grey: search ""edc"" or ""edc kit"" on Youtube. Some people carry SO MUCH, and I want to hear your reaction.  2 Grey, I must say, I agree completely with you when you spoke about legacy. As far as I'm concerned, everything that happens from the moment I die on doesn't really matter. It might be interesting, but I'm not planning life around it.  3 On the other hand, I don't see why you value truth so much, Grey. I value truth and knowledge because they make it easier (for me) to be happy; if repeating a happy memory will make it a happier memory, the accuracy, the truth of that memory, diminishes in value. Happiness is the only thing I ultimately value; everything else I value is simply a means to that end. I feel that that is the most logical way to live, no?  4 I loved your story, Brady. It was a good one. Honestly, I'd love to hear all the outtake ""boring Brady stories;"" boring stories are what make up the bulk of our lives, and sharing those stories makes you a real, 3 dimensional person to me (and of course, the fact that you're a fellow kopite only adds to your realness. You should talk about how your fandom began on an episode). As opposed to Grey, who I think of in the same way that I used to think of Andy (the Android version of Siri)."

CGPGrey,2ivy8a,Evlmnkey,4,Sun Oct 12 23:52:56 2014 UTC,"Are there any other apple users out there with the same attitude about Apple that Grey has? I picked up this attitude over the last couple episodes that even though apple products have all these issues, there is no other option. Every complaint that Grey had I answered with an android or Windows phone. I get that the ecosystem he's got is important to him, but why let a company have that much control over him?  And all the things that he wished the apple watch could do or be, the Pebble smart watch is right now. And it's even compatible with iPhone.  If you don't want to switch, fine but at least acknowledge that you have other options that you are not interested in. Grey said in the comments that switching to android would just create a whole new set of problems. If he can dedicate 16 hours to finding a wallpaper, he can dedicate half a day to setting up a new Android phone.   So if there are others of you out there like this that have horse blinders that only let you see apple products, why is that? Can you explain it to me? Why complain and complain without even acknowledging the alternatives? It would be like me complaining about my grocery store non stop when there are a thousand other grocery stores that I could go to. Maybe they are the only store with my favorite hot sauce, but I think I could be satisfied with the hot sauce at another store, and happier there because it doesn't have all the same issues."

Developed in the 1970s and '80s, rare-earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets made, producing significantly stronger magnetic fields than other types such as ferrite or alnico magnets. The magnetic field typically produced by rare-earth magnets can be in excess of 1.4 teslas, whereas ferrite or ceramic magnets typically exhibit fields of 0.5 to 1 tesla. There are two types: neodymium magnets and samarium-cobalt magnets. Rare earth magnets are extremely brittle and also vulnerable to corrosion, so they are usually plated or coated to protect them from breaking, chipping, or crumbling into powder.

He held office for 60 years, and in that time partially disestablished the church, ripped apart the justice system, enfrancished half the voting population, forced the rich to pay for the war they had ordered, disrespected Queen Victoria to the point she publicly censured him, and even offered Ireland complete home rule.  He was a total badass, and so my middle name is Gladstone.

The poor Unicode support, and more importantly the enormous battery and memory usage are becoming a pain with Chrome.  Don't suppose you've got much experience with FF for Android? A big part of the reason I like the Google stuff is for how well everything syncs across my various computers and mobile devices, particularly bookmarks and currently open tabs.  Also how's search work? Can you set the address bar up to function like Chrome's Omnibar? (e.g. I have it set to keyword ""r"" goes to ""https://www.reddit.com/r/%s"", so I type ""r CGPGrey"" and it takes me to /r/CGPGrey)"
CGPGrey,2hvfy1,TheJonnyB,2,Tue Sep 30 15:32:17 2014 UTC,"Don't suppose you've got much experience with FF for Android?   You're right. I'm a little google-paranoiac so I don't own an android device. Here's what I know :  Firefox sync allows you to share history, bookmarks, preferences etc. on all your devices.  Firefox's awesome bar deserves its name. I don't know about this kind of shortcuts but if you keep your history or bookmark the subreddits, you won't need it. For search shortcuts, I use DuckDuckGo's !Bangs or yubnub.  Firefox will use less memory, but still uses a significant amount. Chrom[ium|e] uses one process per tab and that need a lot of resources but improves crash recovery. I never actually tried in a browser, but turning off spelling checks reduced the memory consuption of some other software I used."

(Podcast number and time stamps are really helpful. I'll be looking at podcast 20 and 21 for this episode)"
CGPGrey,2hjgl2,GreenThunderDovsky,20,Fri Sep 26 19:01:00 2014 UTC,I would just love a clip show of all of greys various disappointed grunts and sighs and just draw his robot avatar growing more and more irate.
CGPGrey,2hjgl2,phalanfy,17,Sat Sep 27 00:38:41 2014 UTC,The 'Do you dance?' bit from Episode 20 (starting 69:01). Would love to see some robot!Grey dance moves.
CGPGrey,2hjgl2,HhhHhm,10,Sat Sep 27 06:55:13 2014 UTC,"I love these animated adventures and can't wait for the next one! I have an idea from the podcast where Brady and Grey discuss how terrible American state flags are. Grey mentions how he hated trying to fit state flags onto the skirts of his video's nation girls. Could you animate a scene of state flag beauty pageant contestants walking down a runway and being harshly criticized by a fashion judge Grey? Or you could interpret it differently, being the awesome animator you are."
CGPGrey,2hjgl2,Feezec,8,Fri Sep 26 20:01:46 2014 UTC,"I thought you were going to say ""can you make Grey playing with dolls, trying to fit a skirt of the flag in the doll but failing and becoming angry?"" which to me sounds more like the situation."
CGPGrey,2hjgl2,fabio-mc,3,Sat Sep 27 13:46:16 2014 UTC,Really terrific work on the king segment. I can't stop laughing at it and its only so very hilarious because it's animated.   Wonderful job mate
CGPGrey,2hjgl2,NavarrB,3,Sat Sep 27 03:23:29 2014 UTC,21 [00:00]: Brady clapping for Grey.  21 [00:29]: Brady describing his array of drinks.  21 [23:45]: Brady slurping his diet coke.

I actually have a great topic that I do wish for you guys to discuss. It is what my sub /r/UnitedWeStand is based on, and I am writing up something soon so that it is clear to others what it is about. CGPGrey's automation video did somewhat touch on that issue, and so I do wonder if he is interested in hearing more. Short descriptions rarely do it any justice, but in short, it is about the importance of bonding in a populace, and how it can be used to make change.   Anyways that was a great video, and I am certainly subscribing to the channel."

CGPGrey,2hjgl2,Relaxedmass,4,Sat Sep 27 15:20:39 2014 UTC,I wonder if Grey and/or Brady like anime. I think Grey would at least be interested in talking about a show like Ghost in the Shell or Knights of Sidonia.
CGPGrey,2hjgl2,Akinera,2,Fri Sep 26 23:01:07 2014 UTC,"I cam here to say that. But, as always is the case, this is the internet. Someone always beats you to it."

This one man operation's as fast as it gets. ALTHOUGH, the feedback from people like you really do make me happy to prioritize HI Animated over other animated projects.  What I think would really speed up the process is having you guys give suggestions for what clips you want animated."
CGPGrey,2hjgl2,GreenThunderDovsky,9,Fri Sep 26 18:46:30 2014 UTC,Ok.. Now I have got to re listen to all the podcast just to pick out the best bits for some random guy on the Internet to dray pictures to the audio because people like it... Worth it... Gotta get started then...

CGPGrey,2hjgl2,JeffDujon,2,Fri Sep 26 17:11:25 2014 UTC,But alas brady are we not using the grey subreddit? Grey may not have a schedule but his community does and I hope this place will continue to harbour the the thoughts of great and intelligent minds...

CGPGrey,2hjgl2,JeffDujon,-7,Fri Sep 26 17:52:08 2014 UTC,"I was more referring to how he has controll over you shared work the podcast, because he doesn't trust your editing although grey' editing may just be so good that we don't notice the gaps and change of conversasion topic and all the hidden goodies you leave out..."

But for everything else on my 5th gen Ipod touch, I am simply forced to turn the brightness slider all the way down.  Besides:   Black text on a white background is everywhere.     Who the hell thinks this is a good idea, anyway? Screens aren't paper, can we stop pretending that they are? Humanity has lived with electronic screens for over 2 decades, I don't believe anyone is going to get confused about what they're looking at because it doesn't look like faux-wood pulp blasting fake sunshine at their faces."

CGPGrey,2hbwrl,Kwpolska,3,Wed Sep 24 17:18:57 2014 UTC,"As of today, there aren't many downsides to jailbreaking.  A lot of people have freaked out over possible security vulnerabilities, although this can be easily avoided by installing packages from the default sources, assuming you use Cydia. Another negligible downside is that if you plan to keep your device in it's jailbroken state, you won't be able to install system software updates immediately as it's released, or you can lose the jailbreak state. If you care about your warranty and legal stuff, you violate those on choosing to jailbreak.  Otherwise, jailbreaking is pretty much safe if you're careful about what you're doing with it."

CGPGrey,2hbwrl,aceROB,2,Wed Sep 24 15:11:41 2014 UTC,"They are all different terms for basically the same thing. The goal of jailbreaking an iOS device is to get root acces, as is the same goal of rooting."
CGPGrey,2hbwrl,gtothecool,-3,Wed Sep 24 15:22:11 2014 UTC,"Not that there will be any jailbreaks for iOS 8 for a VERY long time. Unlike most android phone providers, Apple likes to lock all of the vulnerabilities that can allow jailbreaking out of their OS."
CGPGrey,2hbwrl,EDGY_USERNAME_HERE,6,Wed Sep 24 15:35:24 2014 UTC,"They don't lock it for to punish the jailbreak community. A jailbreak is basically a security breach that can be used to infiltrate the phone. If they want to closed it to jailbreak, they wouldn't allow it to restore, simply connect to ITunes or close the breach as soon as it's discovered.  They are letting it live and even seems to take idea from it."
CGPGrey,2hbwrl,Kaphox,15,Wed Sep 24 20:54:23 2014 UTC,"I've owned IPhones, Android phones, and Windows Phones, and I must say Windows Phone is the only one that does this right. Windows Phone is dark by default and it is gorgeous.

All of the iOS Apps run inside of sandboxes and the user has to give permissions for the apps to access other parts of the system like your photos and contacts. The new extensions can only run in controlled sandboxed bubbles, from what I understand of this. Even third party keyboards run inside of sandboxes and have to ask permission to transmit what you type. It is this control which makes iOS one of the most secure ecosystems.  To enable a third-party program that would invert textbased regions of the screen but not images, icon and symbols would require basically unrestricted access to the entire system. This kind of feature would have to be implemented by Apple themselves and seeing how long we have all wanted to be able to change our default apps like browsers and they have done nothing, don't expect anything anytime soon."

CGPGrey,2hbwrl,ztherion,2,Tue Sep 30 03:31:46 2014 UTC,"That's... not really a great argument. Android is at this point no more time consuming than iOS. I'm biased, but I tend to think that if you were buying your first smartphone today, Android would be the obvious choice for pretty much anyone.  The argument that Grey's actually made in a podcast is that the switching cost is so high that even though Android might be great, it has to be absolutely spectacular to be worth switching. I'm not sure I agree, but this article doesn't help -- Android Lollipop is just as white as the recent iOS, maybe whiter."

I thought I could even make a case that the switching cost is not only worthwhile, but worth spending as soon as possible.  But it looks like the new Android has made all sorts of things bright white, just like the new iOS. Yes, it's up to individual app developers to make things dark, and yes, the ""default"" theme for an app is dark, but everyone just makes it look white because all the Google apps look white anyway. ""Invert Colors"" is buried in the settings, just like iOS. After you use it once, it shows up in the quick settings menu, but that's a two-finger-swipe from the top of the screen, then a tap, then swipe back up -- clearly not something that's meant to be toggled per-app.  There are Flux-like apps, but most of them require rooting, similar to jailbreaking on an iPhone.

It's almost like the light is coming from somewhere else.  Like her hair.  And disappearing into her black hole eyes.  Okay, maybe not much better.  For textview-heavy apps, inverting luminance would probably give a decent experience.

A cognate is a word that is spelled the same (or very similar) in multiple languages and means the roughly the same thing.  A false friend looks like it is a helpful cognate but actually means something different.  For example, in french, rester means to stay, not to rest.  If one saw the word ""bicyclette"" they would assume it means bicycle which it does.  Creating more false friends like auto make these cognates less reliable.  Edit: Also, in my opinion, the Dutch false friend, die, is not that big of a deal.  People don't expect English and Dutch to have as many cognates as other languages.  English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish all have a significant overlap, making people more likely to fall for ""false friends""."

A lazy solution to this is to maintain two copies: the original unbroken file, and a left-justified Calibre copy.

For example ""More on President Bush's decision ... | Moron President Bush's decision"", or ""insurgents reached the capital this weekend | insurgence reached the capital this weekend"", which is a very subtle distinction, or in the case of ""bum"", when I hear the British usage, I like to think of the American usage.

The best thing you can do to secure your phone is to have a long, complicated password which you do not use for any other device/service and then to regularly change it.  That is the best thing now, it was the best thing when Touch ID launched, and it will probably continue to be the best thing for the next few years.  Touch ID is not the best security thing you can do with your device, it's just that it's way way better than nothing, and it's not much harder than nothing. That is what Apple themselves claim. They are not saying ""Touch ID is the most secure thing you could ever have, forget about passwords they suck"". They are saying ""This is better than a 4-digit PIN, but it's not as good as a complex alpha-numeric password.""  I think that Touch ID is a good thing, and I think Android devices should adopt it. The average phone user is not very security conscious. A very large number of users do not have any security at all. I would like to see a world with more options for easy to use security features that at least match the security of a 4 digit PIN."

After that, I have to enter an entirely unrelated PIN into the wallet app. And it's that unrelated PIN that gives it the security.

Similar plastic inserts, but they're BLACK. It's a nice sharp contrast and it looks great to me.  http://imgur.com/Mtt9NSc - iPhone 6. The plastic inserts are a weird grey, neither matching nor contrasting with the metal body. It also leaves an ""island"" around the camera module, where the proportions don't quite work.  From the front, or in the hand? The new design is great - the sharp edges on the 4 and 5 looked great, but they were a backwards step for usability. The return of rounded edges is to be encouraged, and it really does look nice.  I just hate the fact that the plastic is a colour which neither matches or contrasts with the body. That's very un-Apple."

CGPGrey,2gydd2,314j,4,Sun Sep 21 16:44:18 2014 UTC,"I'm not a lawyer nor an expert on legal traditions in various countries, but I'd say that here in Sweden we never reference any document older than 300 years (the oldest laws still in effect are from 1736). On the other hand, there are legal principles that are much older than that (you can tell because they have a name in Latin). Many European nations are younger than this (Germany, Italy, Finland) or have experienced revolutions or similar events that have overhauled the legal foundations of society (France, Russia and most of eastern Europe) so I have a feeling that the situation may be similar there."

CGPGrey,2gydd2,Kukironosuke,3,Sat Sep 20 17:46:27 2014 UTC,"I don't want to appear negative but the talk about phones made me think of something. A small percentage of people have prosopagnosia, they are unable to recognize human faces so different people will just appear to have the same 'generic' face and they can't distinguish between people based on face alone, they need to get to know the person well and notice other details like hair, clothes, etc. I wonder if there's a similar thing with inanimate objects?  See, when people talk about phones or cars, saying how elegant or ugly they look, I can't usually tell there's a difference. As Grey and Brady were talking about the iPhone 6's design, I looked it up and compared it to other iPhones and while I can see some differences, I can't really see them as being different enough that I could see them side by side and immediately know which is which. The same happens to me with cars: obviously they come in different colors, and some have more square shapes while others have more rounded or aerodynamic shapes, but overall different models look pretty similar to me. Knowing the internet, I know it's unlikely I'm alone in this respect so I'm wondering if other people have had similar experiences where they see people comment on the differences between two objects (phones, cars, laptops, etc) and you just want to scream ""It's a phone, it looks like almost any other phone made in the last 5 years!"""

CGPGrey,2guexy,Chooquaeno,66,Fri Sep 19 08:47:31 2014 UTC,I'm guessing a pretty good portion of those people are there for one of two reasons:  1) It's kinda fun to be there on opening day.  Can't argue people out of their fun.    2) They are being paid to wait for someone else.  Companies like TaskRabbit sell this as a service.
CGPGrey,2guexy,CooroSnowFox,31,Fri Sep 19 08:58:41 2014 UTC,"It's kinda fun to be there on opening day   I think people really underestimate this. Having a new thing is really fun. This is why people like to go to movies on opening night or opening weekend. New toys and new experiences are fun.  Also, people like to have popular things. Bars and clubs will always create a line well before they are at their capacity, because having a line makes your bar look popular and makes people want to go there."
CGPGrey,2guexy,Chooquaeno,3,Fri Sep 19 11:25:09 2014 UTC,"I go to movies on opening night because it doesn't cost more or take longer than going another night. If I had to wait in line for six hours to go on opening night, I would go another night"

A lot of the black people here are also immigrants from ex colonies rather than descendants of slaves brought here ages ago, which is why race relations are very different here compared to the US.  there are different areas in london with different concentrations of ethnicities, some areas are 'greek areas' or 'chinese areas' for example where you have a lot. Some places in east london are mostly asian for example, but when it comes to central london (which this video is) i think it's pretty much representative of london overall."

So they have to be simple enough to be distinguishable from afar and this reflects in most European Coats of Arm (see: Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy). If they're close, that's because there are good historical reasons (i.e. that used to be one region, etc..) .

CGPGrey,2ftuby,tullynipp,44,Tue Sep 9 06:23:17 2014 UTC,"The ""Auto"" issue:  Automobile is ""Auto"" self ""mobile"" moving.  Germans calling cars ""Autos"" is just them abbreviating an international/interlingual word.  If I say ""car"" to a German they know what I mean. If he says ""Auto"" to me I know what he means. If I start calling self driving cars ""autos"" then It will cause confusion by essentially having the same word used internationally for different versions of the same thing.  You hit the nail on the head with the smart phone example but you still seemed to miss the point. We say ""smart phone"" because there are more than just smart phone available. In the future, when you can only get smart phones, they will be known as just ""phones"" because the smart becomes irrelevant.  For cars we would have to call them something like ""Autocars"". This would differentiate them from Cars AND Autos (which also have auto transmissions, auto wipers, auto headlights, etc.). Then one day in the future when the vast majority of cars on the road are self driving we will start calling them just ""cars"" again (or maybe some other new name we can't think of), dropping the unnecessary portion of the word, and people with old manually controlled cars will refer to them as ""Manuals"" or something."

And in languages which have so much influence on each other like German and English (even it is very one sided) there are already enough of them and cause enough problems. No need to create more of them.
CGPGrey,2ftuby,US_Sherlock,11,Mon Sep 8 19:52:10 2014 UTC,Your argumentation about this shows that you are not a fan of other languages.    Wrong.  Indifference to collections of sounds meaning different things in different languages does not mean that I'm 'not a fan of languages'.   there are already enough of them and cause enough problems.    What are the problems?  (Beyond perhaps momentary embarrassment or unintentionally funny signs)
CGPGrey,2ftuby,articulationsvlog,7,Mon Sep 8 19:57:34 2014 UTC,"What are the problems?   VWs current ad slogan in the US (at least last year) was   VW  Das Auto.   This was litereally the first thing that came to mind. Also, ""auto"" is used in US advertising in general. Auto-repair pops up constantly and I think I heard auto-insurance (though car-insurance seems to be more common).  Regardless, I don't really think this is a problem. Self driving cars will probably never get a special name. And if, they will rather be called smart-cars than autos, since they still are a car (like smart phones still are phones). In the end, this desingation will rise organically from advertising/desiging circles and the general population. Trying to force a particular term is very hard with the ""limited"" (note: I am not saying you are not popular, but I work in an IT department in Austria, and besides me, none of my 30+ colleagues even heard from you) reach even you have."

During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored. In a universe of electrons and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won't find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice.

CGPGrey,2ftuby,JeffDujon,9,Tue Sep 9 06:32:14 2014 UTC,"After listening to your cirque de soleil fears I was reminded of perhaps my worst ever first date.  Me and this, presumably, nice young lass were at some similar show sitting neat the front. About 30 minutes into the performance some of the cast started filtering into the audience for assistance. One of them stopped at me and was trying to get me to hop on stage, I having terrible social anxiety decided instantly this would be a bad idea. I thought I could mime out that my leg was less than functional hoping this would drive the cast to someone else, this attempt seemed to work as she was about to move onward when my date declared , 'No, wait, he's fine.'  I was distraught and decided to go for broke, the cast member was now pulling me by my arms trying to get me to get up, the entire audience is booing quite loudly at this point.  I was finally pulled to my feet and feigned my right leg giving out, I crashed very hard onto my face and ended up biting my cheek and tongue causing quite a bit of blood to dribble from my mount.  It was at this point I clawed and climbed my way back into my seat, making sure to reserve my right leg in order to make my claims of feebleness seem beyond a doubt sincere.  The cast member scurried away hurriedly, my date stormed out a few moments later as well while receiving quite the booing from the crowd herself for presumably setting me up to fall.  At the end of the show the manager gave me sincere apologies and offered a refund which I refused, but class act on them."

I mean, the more specific I am, the more chances the voters will disagree with one small detail and vote against just because of that. This way, people thinking ""Scotland should be independent but I disagree with you prioritizing education over healthcare"" still vote yes and then the new country decides on its priorities later instead of losing all these votes and never becoming independent.   I also disagree with the fact that the rulers of the party might not want to become independent. It felt a bit like saying ""Who would ever want to be the American President? It's so much work and stress, surely nobody would want that. Poor guy that got tricked into becoming president"""
CGPGrey,2ftuby,MOROZILnic,7,Mon Sep 8 20:38:27 2014 UTC,"I actually thought the separatist movements were vague about the ""how"" on purpose to have a better chance at wining.   This is so true in politics I was a bit sad to not hear it discussed. As an example, in competitive debate, it is always risky when you put forward a plan for change as there are numerous ways that an opponent can attack your plan. The more vague assertion, ""Scotland should be independent."" dodges the problem of having an actual plan and gives people a much more nebulous idea which they can shape into anything they like in their minds."

The people with a vested interest in keeping the UK together are also the ones limiting the flow of information. The SNP have offered many solutions to the questions being asked, the problem is that the UK government refuses to comment on any of these (they don't wish to comment on a hypothetical), leaving many Scots in the dark.  And considering the actions of the UK government surrounding the AV vote are you really surprised?"

It turns out I should have just used the Grey-approved method of Don't Do Homework.  Aside from Be Right Back, every episode seemed to devolve into ""people are shitbags,""  and the only reason that didn't end the same way is because the writers never explored any of the details of the worlds they created.  The heroine's android was supposed to be expensive, but apparently not, since she could afford it on an artist's salary.  Humans riding bicycles can power thousands of screens?  Really?  They have the technology for mind-wipes, and use it exclusively for torture?  And going back the androids, why wasn't the woman ever listening to the radio so we could hear news about android legislation?

Okay, an episode about the android's company's predatory tactics would be interesting. But you could say that about anything. That's not the story Charlie Booker wanted to tell.

Most people doing international business trips will probably be advanced in the target language (or less) but far from properly fluent and yes, word confusion can actually lead to ordering the wrong amount or the completely wrong parts and it's not that unusual. (Disclaimer: I used to worked for two different car companies I rather not name ;) ). I mean even NASA can mix things up badly in international projects and it's probably worse in most private companies.  On a more practical note, we live in an international community where more people consume English speaking media outside English speaking countries than inside. So no car company is going to market a car as ""auto"" in an international ad campaign and confuse their customers with a word that just means car in lots of common languages (German, Dutch, Spanish, French). Also VW holds the trademark for ""Das Auto"" in the US. ;)"

I found out about two months ago that I can get digital audio books from my library via my phone. Best part... Libraries are free so my cost is zero and my gain is infinite.  I agree with the current consensus in this discussion I prefer not to see your face, I've got this image in my mind that fits your voice perfectly, and I don't want that spoiled.

CGPGrey,2ead05,Prankster42,27,Fri Aug 22 20:20:52 2014 UTC,"Well said, Grey. Frankly, if anything, I'd pay not to see your face, as my mind's eye's sight is a little more valuable to me.  edit: I have an idea why we might react differently to a face projected onto a voice. It's a monkey-brain thing. It's hard to ""know"" (or pretend to know) anything about a voice. All our instinctual survival intellect can tell us is stuff about your accent, inflection, etc. But show us your face, and people will start to make instinctive judgments. He's white, he looks untrustworthy, he's attractive (Halo Effect anyone?), he's ugly, etc.  So, I really don't want my monkey-brain...erm...monkeying around with my perceptions of you."
CGPGrey,2ead05,Scrubie_Wahoooo,6,Fri Aug 22 16:29:11 2014 UTC,I wonder how much monkeying has already happened with just the stick figure. Would our perception of Grey be different if he didn't use any visual representation of himself at all?
CGPGrey,2ead05,Prankster42,7,Fri Aug 22 18:53:39 2014 UTC,Possibly. But I don't see why I need to alter that perception even further.

CGPGrey,2ead05,Prankster42,4,Fri Aug 22 19:16:09 2014 UTC,visual avatar is a tool to be used with caution it would be interesting to know why he chose to use it.   The stick figure? He answered that in a Q&A video. He can't draw for his servomotors. Or do you mean his anonymity in general? I think he just doesn't want his face plastered all over the Interwebs.
CGPGrey,2ead05,Scrubie_Wahoooo,2,Fri Aug 22 19:22:00 2014 UTC,"But why did he settle on an avatar instead of just being a voice? It might have some advantages in the medium, but reading this he makes a compelling argument that the stick figure shouldn't be there at all."

CGPGrey,2ead05,mirozi,1 point,Fri Aug 22 19:45:21 2014 UTC,I believe this is why so many people over at Twitter use anime characters as avatars. It makes you think they're a cute and fun person instead of judging them from their appearances. This is definitely an interesting discussion.

CGPGrey,2ead05,mirozi,2,Fri Aug 22 16:52:04 2014 UTC,"Agreed, I don't enjoy audiobooks much, either. I tried to get into Podcasts, but until Hello Internet, I wasn't really able to do it. Indeed, my enjoyment of HI is directly tied to the videos.  Admittedly, I'm a bit of a philisteen; there are very few forms of art I enjoy, and those forms are not to be tampered with. I rarely read fiction, and prefer it to be fairly realistic when I do (Star Wars is my only exception, and I think the midiclorians made the series better). So that may well explain why I can't enjoy audiobooks."

CGPGrey,2ead05,Amanoo,2,Fri Aug 22 17:25:00 2014 UTC,"I couldn't agree more. I personally think a story should be in the domain of the reader not the writer.

I don't want to know how the writer intended words to be pronounced or phrases to be emphasised - that's up to me. Audiobooks destroy this."

I have discovered a new facet to Grey in past months (A new facet of the shifting glass if you will). With the advent of the Hello Internet podcast and with his new Humans Need Not Apply video as well with his insightful and beautifully worded blogposts I find that Grey is a figure that is personable and in his own way very friendly. The fact that I could bump into Grey on the Tube without knowing is a fact that is both exciting and mysterious. Although now I realise that London's Tube, filled with people with headphones firmly in their ears is the perfect camouflage for Grey.   CGP Grey, thank you for all you are doing for us.

The same is true for characters in novels; even if they are described in detail. I guess that's because I don't really care about their visual. That blurry image in my head is enough to place that person in the world (which I can picture much more clearly, though). I don't need more. I much more care about those people's actions and traits.  Is it only me? Do you have more details in your mental images?  (The Grey in my mind is wearing glasses, though.)"

It doesn't effect me in the slightest. The fact that it really could honestly seems weird. It's just a face. Get over it.

And this post is maybe created just to pose the question to many unsure soles whether they would want or wouldn't want to see Grey's face. Of course, this is connected to his recent announcement that he would reveal his face in an unlisted video but come on - we know it will leak eventually. I think he tries to convince the unsure population that there is this hidden magic and at least try to limit the possibility of leakage. It all boils down to what kind of a person you are - do you want to know stuff or keep things mysterious and play with the virtual and imagination. And of course the same person can behave differently in different situations. I for one want to know stuff - I wouldn't fall for the trap ""Yeah, it is so nice to keep things a mystery, so romantic"". And I thought Grey is the same and just doesn't show his face out of privacy concerns which is a totally different thing."

I sort of pride myself in my eyesight. My vision is perfectly crisp from any distance over 7 centimeters (2.7 or so inches), and as a gamer I rather depend on my vision. It's also useful (though not required, as demonstrated by a blind classmate with a braille machine) for programming. I'm also a bit of a film geek, although not extremely so.

I remember watching Minute Physics' videos and thinking of them as just well done bite size science videos. They could have been made by anybody, at least in my mind. A different guy every week for all I knew. If I pictured a face at all during this time I guarantee it will have been my stock ""Middle American Male"" face.  But when I finally saw him in a Youtube Meetup video, and this guy Henry turns out to be the guy behind the curtain, planning, drawing and narrating all of this content I'd been enjoying, it suddenly became a lot more personal.  Sad to say I was the same with Brady's videos. Although it was a little different in that his accent distinguished a 'character' in early videos in which he remained off camera. I'm sort of horrified that I've succumbed to whatever it is makes many people attracted to celebrity culture, only within the microcosm that is YouTube. Perhaps it's innate in some people to want to get to know these 'characters' (who are - let's not forget - real people, not just characters), and for those like me, it's nice to have a face to put to a voice.  For a long time I've come to accept that CPG Grey is a talking white circle with glasses. Were that to change, I for one wouldn't complain at all. Were it to remain that way, I'd also be content....just not quite so."

Any time I am listening to a faceless voice, I do actually see a face. But it is like an ancient, blurred memory of a face, I could not accurately describe it, it completely lacks details. Adult male calm face, that's about all the details.   This imaginary generic face is shared in my mind's eye, between Coe and CGP Grey, and a few others with similarly relaxing voices.  In the mean time, I have actually seen Coe's face. But despite that, when I listen to just his voice, my brain still matches it with the imaginary generic face.

They have literally censored Marxism  EDIT: Just have to clarify: Marx believed that eventually, capitalism would reach the point where all of the value in the economy was produced by industrial automation, and the only people who profited were the ones who owned the machines. His whole message was that when we reached that point, we would ""evolve"" into a communist economy. Marx's original belief was not really ""humans working selflessly together for the common good bcuz they're all bffs."" It was more like ""Machines do everything, humans just kinda chill."" Important to note here that because none of the ""communist"" governments have been post-scarcity economies, there has never actually been a totally Marxist society."

I think as driverless cars become more common, the word 'car' will just come to mean a self-piloting car.  Like how automobiles started as some bizarre 'horseless carriage,' but as they became more common, you didn't need to specify the 'horseless' part anymore. (I know most people don't call cars carriages, but I have heard it used instead of bus before)  In fact, now that carriages drawn by horses are more the exception than the rule, you have to specify 'horse-drawn' carriage since it's taken for granted that most vehicles are horseless.  So, in the future, I think car will mean a self-driven car and 'hand-driven' car will be used to describe the few cars that aren't.  Seems more efficient to me than making up a new word."

But I'm sitting in front of a computer now and I felt like shouting ""Efficiency Dividend"" while I was listening before.  Basically, we have been very poor in reaking in the dividend of increased efficiency. The labour marked is already terribly skewed. Those who work work hard as ever and those who can't get severely disadvantaged. It is really really dificult to change this. But the problem is going to get bigger and we will have to find solutions. Just spreading the work over more people who work less is not going to work by regular current market forces. I think we need to find a way to reak in the fruits of increased efficiency into society and not purely into growing the economy as it was done since forever.  Every alternative solution sounds like communism. But naively, wouldn't you all agree that a world where people work less and are more wealthy sounds a whole lot more favourable than what we are leading to and already have in many ways?  Perhaps some kind of automation tax which will be used to increase well being and health of all the population? It's going to be hard convincing people to spread productivity over more workers. I would love more free time, but also I'm a workaholic and I love the money I earn. Maybe some corrective tax incentive would make it more favourable to share my job with others?  A Star Treck like utopia sounds horrible. But something a bit like that sounds increadibly appealing to me.

We simply need to recreate the foundations of our economies and our conception of ownership.  Accumulation of wealth mixed with unlimited robot slaves and billions of unemployed is at best a recipe for totalitarian corporatism and at worst societal collapse.  We need to democratize economic decisions from the bottom up.  No matter how you frame it, we need to take a closer look at what anarchists and socialists have been saying about the nature of work for over a century, if we ignore it do to modern political bias, we do so at our own expense."

CGPGrey,2dwl6s,NeoNavras,5,Tue Aug 19 10:13:02 2014 UTC,"It's a silly notion. Capitalism is no better than socialism. It's all about moderation. A system of extreme capitalism would be at least as just much a horror as a communist system. I do very much like free market capitalism, but a free market is not at all a stable state. Just look at what Comcast and Time Warner did. They have pretty much achieved monopolies. Free market capitalism is actually not in any company's best interests, if they can find a way in which they can be ""the only one"", they'll often be willing to do anything to achieve that. Because monopolies are good for companies. Comcast can get away by asking ridiculous amounts of money for a mediocre internet connection. And that's just because they are the only ISP in many regions. Either you get a bad connection that the ISP hardly puts any money into (and gets a lot of money out of), or you don't get internet at all. I do believe in a healthy free market, where multiple companies compete, keeping prices relatively low, forcing innovation and giving freedom of choice to the customer. But that really only works if you can maintain that status quo. It's not a stable state, and therefore, regulations are needed. Otherwise the system will either become unhealthy (for example companies may start forming a cartel) or you will end up with no free market at all. It's a rather delicate state of capitalism that requires a lot of socialism to maintain. It's quite strange in that regard."

CGPGrey,2dwl6s,experience_life,11,Mon Aug 18 20:16:37 2014 UTC,"I do agree with Grey regarding automation but I think the time scale is way off economically (not technical). Just because a self-driving car is legal doesn't mean it will be used automatically over night by all companies. A lot of transportation jobs are last mile, e.g. a UPS driver’s job is not to drive but to deliver. The more easy to automate transport jobs like long-haul trucking will be replaced by a slow moving process throughout the economy similar to horses not being replaced over night by cars. This is true for most automation of jobs including white-collar workers.  Second on the opposite end of the time scale, we already have automation based structural unemployment and had it since the 50s in the developed world. A lot of workers were made obsolete by automation (among several reasons) in the last 50 years which leads to the manufacturing sector in the USA now only employing 10% of the work force vs 30% in 40s. These 20% didn't all become structurally unemployed. Some shifted up but more shifted down to lower paying service jobs which is one reason for the widening income gap.  Third, a lot of these service and other low-paid jobs are very very hard to automate for robots not because they are not capable of it but it’s not cost effective. Humans can be much much cheaper than a specialised and especially a general purpose robot for a lot of tasks. That is one reason that manufacturing is still employing 10% of the work force: some jobs are just not economically feasible to be replaced by full automation in the short or medium term. Long term, sure, but that is the far away utopia mentioned in the podcast.  Fourth, the Luddite fallacy is not about the creation of not seen before jobs but that technology increases productivity. This means increase in return on capital/labour and therefore increase is spend/invested which creates more jobs in the rest of the economy like the service sector mentioned above.  In sum, I do agree that in the long term automation will make employment optional. But just because it’s currently technical feasible doesn’t mean it will change the economy over night or that the economy doesn’t have the capacity to move most people into other jobs while the rest is absorbed by the current programs for structural employment (especially in Europe). I also believe we are dealing with this impact of both robotic and computer automation on both blue and white collar workers since the 50s and so far it has been relatively peaceful."

These things move slowly with big companies being first adopters followed by local companies and at different speed in different regions not even taking different countries into consideration.  The closest comparable change I can think of is the introduction of the shipping container which made the traditional job of docker worker essential obsolete. This took several decades and created large structural unemployment locally (for example in the town of Tilbury, UK) but the economy as a whole had no problem absorbing the surplus workers and most people benefited from the automation greatly (via cheaper imports/exports)."
CGPGrey,2dwl6s,NillieK,5,Tue Aug 19 04:23:30 2014 UTC,"How fast were cell phones adopted? Especially smartphones? Ten years ago they did not exist, today they are ubiquitous and pervasive, and companies are trying their damnedest to make affordable smartphones for previously untapped markets like rural Indians and Chinese.  Same thing will happen with autos. The iphone took the world by storm in 3 years, and captured pretty much the entire upper echelon techie space. Then Android phones came along and distributed the tech to the masses, and displaced Apple while doing so, and that took only 2 - 3 years.  And the difference is that smartphones are consumer devices heavily dependent on their affordability for their target audience with much slimmer margins than the industrial transportation industry that autos will displace well before consumer vehicles. Companies can easily sink billions into the technology because their annual budget for the human labor they spend as is already costs that much. So smartphones made our lives better but cost us to do so - autos make lives better and save money. Same way so many systems digitized in the span of years in the 90s (banks seemed to do it overnight)."
CGPGrey,2dwl6s,orarius,3,Tue Aug 19 09:42:32 2014 UTC,"Cell phones existed since the 70s, smart phones since the late 90s. It was not that fast a transition as it seems, because we usually only notice the tail end of an exponential growth. Same for the adoption of the computer or digitization. Lots of those things are going on since the 70s and their effect on the work force increased slowly over time.  Companies have existing capital stock with dedicated life time. They buy a car, put it on the books and depreciate over time. From an accounting point of view the savings of the self-driving car including saved labour cost have to outweigh that lifetime value to replace a fleet the moment self-driving cars become available. Not a wise accounting choice. Instead they will replace cars that reach end of life and that will be a slow process. Again, shipping containers are the best example of a technology in transport that both saved massive costs and massive labour and they took decades to adopt."

If this is the goal of the video and podcast I support it.  I do disagree with presenting this as a overnight change that will lead to mass unemployment and riots.

But I think another better way to go about it would be to pay people to continue learning things, whatever that might be. A better more educated public is more useful to society as a whole and it would give people something to do with their lives. Also the unemployable could educate themselves into employable status."

I think there's evidence of that all around us in the current climate.  As we progress, there will be a point where you literally won't be able to educate yourself to an employable level simply because robots will have almost any job and will learn it faster than you and do it better than you.  You simply can't educate yourself to compete.  Also, this is an absolute economic blackhole.  Where does the money come from?  We pay people to learn so that we can pay them to work at jobs where they don't perform as well as cheaper robot labor?  There's literally no sense in it."

That could lead to a society where you are paid based on your IQ.  Though as I started writing this I wondered if you could have a system that pays purely based on time studying.  So you have a system like coursera which consists of a huge array of courses over as wide a range of topics as possible including very easy courses.  Then you have to watch the lectures and answer questions to move on to the next lecture in the course.  Even if you were a slow learner you would be paid the same as a fast learner based on the hours you put in.  Even in a world where everything is automated, there will still be limited natural resources available.  So it seems like you would still need a monetary system in order to determine who gets to have so much of each resource.  A learning based economy seems like one option."

If you could somehow get everyone to achieve a degree in rocket surgery, it's unlikely that there's going to be enough demand in the field to employ everyone, and at the same time the value of being educated drops.  A basic income might work but there are many things that have to be carefully considered first. You would need a system in place like a flat tax of total value including all assets. That would be a tough fight. The people with the assets are the ones with the power to influence a tax system and they would likely prevent the necessary tax policies for a stable basic income system. Realistically I think something major would have to happen first on a global level that allows for some leveling of current ownership and a reformatting of our ideas of ownership."
CGPGrey,2dwl6s,Peas320,3,Mon Aug 18 20:41:16 2014 UTC,"I think learning is intrinsically valuable and enjoyable, so I've found this idea really appealing. Something like basic income is likely to be a necessity, but having a society where everybody is involved in lifelong learning and education is one of the best outcomes I could see.  In the future, when nobody or few have employable skills and knowledge, learning will still be a fun way to spend time and socialise regardless of it being directed at attaining employment. Many people enjoy tutoring and teaching and when learning is self-directed people often enjoy learning. Education needn't be expensive. If people weren't being pushed through courses en masse to take up employment, everybody could take part in teaching. Spending time teaching also has the benefit of improving your learning and retention of a topic.  This learning doesn't need to be restricted to academic topics either. It could include arts, hobbies, games and sports."

A while ago Amanda Palmer did an interesting TED talk about her work as a street performer, essentially selling human interaction as a commodity. My brain put the two together and begun to think of 'cultural employment' where we have a situation where we ensure every citizen has a living wage, but for those being helped by the government, we want them to be putting something back into society - whether volunteering or otherwise offering cultural benefits to others. Living in the UK, I think we're a long way off the mark right now, but I'd be interested to see how Scandanavian countries responds to the issues discussed, I have a feeling they might take a route similar to this.  Second, on the graph linking GDP and employment, I don't think you took into account international outsourcing.

CGPGrey,2dwl6s,crankshaft2,3,Mon Aug 18 21:06:08 2014 UTC,There was never any guarantee in laissez faire economics that everyone gets a job in the end.   It's more of a fallacy to believe that there's no case in which technology is able to displace the job market than the other way around. What law of nature dictates that there will always be something else that comes along? Anecdotal evidence from a very brief amount of time at the very beginning of global industrialization is not sufficient evidence. Farmers can move to offices but where do office workers move? We've never experienced an economy like we have now.  As you mentioned progress can't be stopped. Laissez faire economics is naturally optimization oriented and human labor will almost never be the right kind of optimal (unless we're paying people to be people of course). If your company is not automating then your competitor's probably is. Any artificial measure by a company or country to shoe in inefficiency (such as human labor) is not sustainable. The employed will still be buying the most cost effective products at the end of the day.  Good podcast this week.
CGPGrey,2dwl6s,mrchutra,5,Mon Aug 18 22:31:02 2014 UTC,"So Brady's observation that governments or even corporations themselves will try to prop up the old economy by artificially employing people would be the worst long term solution, IMHO. Basically it would have the effect of permanently entrenching the doom scenario of high unemployment, while never letting society move through the painful transition into the abundance economy.  That's not to say that there shouldn't be some attempt to moderate the effects of the transition... And that may call for some protectionist-style regulation... But as a general policy strategy, it's basically the worst of both worlds, because it won't stop progress, and it won't let us get to the abundance economy on the other side."

Its on a similar topic, but more concerned with what society will do AFTER our robot overlords take all our jobs.  I posted it in the comments for the original video but it got buried since I was a johnny-come-lately :)  Here it is for anyone who cares to read it: http://reasoncentral.wordpress.com/2014/08/17/socialism-brought-to-you-by-robots/  WALL OF TEXT WARNING   Part 1, The Problem  The S word, socialism, has become something of a boogyman in the United States a few other nations. However, no matter how much people fear it, the big S may be the only thing that keeps our society together in the coming decades. Why? In one word: Robots. In a few more words: The population dynamics of a planet with limited resources dictate the increasing automation of industry to maintain our living standards. The prior sentence may sound a bit out of odds with title of this piece, so allow me to back up a few steps.  Lets start with a simple premise that we all can agree on: The planet can only support so many human beings living on it. We still dont know exactly what that number is, or when our population will reach it, but that limit is there, and sooner or later we will get there. Over the last several decades we’ve done everything we could to push that day back, from improving agricultural efficiency, to developing renewable sources of energy. Nevertheless, only a fixed amount of solar energy reaches the surface of our planet per year, and there is only so much thermal energy that can be extracted from geothermal, fossil and nuclear fuel sources on a regular basis. The optimist in me of course hopes that one day before we reach that limit, humanity will finally branch out from Earth and start Homo sapiens franchises throughout our solar system and beyond. For the sake of discussion though, lets assume that for the foreseeable future we are stuck on old mother Terra.  Next, lets think about what happens when a population cannot grow. This is a bit of a problem due to another (for the foreseeable future) inescapable fact; that as humans age we are less able to work and care for ourselves. Given that we don’t want out elderly to die in squalor, the work age population needs to work enough to simultaneously support both their own parents generation, themselves, and their children. The only way this works out is if there are always more young people to work, than old people who cant work. This necessitates a continuously expanding population, which we just agreed can’t go on indefinitely.  For a resolution to this issue, we need to look at a country that is already starting to deal with the problems caused by a shortage of labor due to an aging population: Japan. In typical (or perhaps stereotypical?) Japanese fashion, the solution turned out to be robots. Over the next several years, the Japanese industry is planning to automate as many of the jobs involved with caring for an aging population as possible. We are talking about robot cleaners, robot caretakers, and even robot companions to deal with loneliness. These aren’t speculations, the prototypes are already being market tested and mass adoption is around the corner. “Perfect!” you might think to yourself, we can relax in the cold, yet comforting embrace of our robot guardians in our sunset years, without burdening our children. But like with most major technological innovations, there is an even greater if unintentional effect on broader society. Robotics and automation can make up our labor shortage, but once the technologies necessary for all this to work are mature enough for mass adoption, they can then replace just about any human worker, even in fields with no labor shortage. Who honestly thinks that a for-profit corporation will turn down a chance to increase profits through replacing more of their workforce with machines?  Replacing human labor with mechanization happened during the industrial revolution, has continued unabated ever since, and will certainly accelerate as our robotics technologies mature. Of course there will still be a need for some human specialists and supervisors, but the amount of work options available to the average person will be drastically reduced. In all likelihood you’ve already seen glimpses of it when you do your banking online (or at an ATM) instead of speaking to a teller, when you use the automatic checkout in a store instead of standing in line for the cashier, or read about Google’s self-driving cars. These are just the tip of the oncoming automation iceberg.  Don’t let the above situation scare you though, with the increased automation of labor intensive work like farming, transportation, manufacturing and construction, products will be cheaper and more abundant than ever before. The real issue will be how to distribute those products to to the people who need them. Our current economic model relies on people to work, earning the money that they spend to aquire those products. But how will people buy, when the very machines that produce the merchandise they need have put them out of work?  Part 2, The Solution  At this stage the government could do nothing, in which case we will be stuck in another great depression, food queues and all. Alternatively, the government could nationalize the means of production for food and other necessities, but we have seen how well such economies have fared in the past. The best solution would of course be for the government to maintain our existing market economy, but find a way to provide an income or employment for all its citizens. Such measures have been proposed and rejected in the past (most recently in Switzerland) in the form of a “citizens’ income”, under which every citizen would receive a living stipend from the government regardless of their situation. The reason it was not adopted, and would probably not be adopted in the future is that for many people it feels instinctively ‘unfair’ for someone to receive a living wage even if they willfully do nothing. This unfairness could be resolved by the government employing all those who can’t find other work. But what kind of work should that be? Mindless menial work and pointless construction projects? A number of speculative works like Kurt Vonnegut’s Player Piano have explored the degradation of society as a result of similar endeavors; What meaning is there to life when the only thing you are deemed fit for is thoughtless make-work?  A better way for the government to distribute currency would be to use the very fact that machines make menial tasks a waste of time for human labor. In essence, I am proposing that the government pay each citizen a living wage in exchange for continuing their education. Those who are not qualified for specialized work can study until they are. The biggest limitation to what a person can learn is not some hard limit on what they can comprehend but how much time is required to do so. With an unlimited amount of time to devote to an area of interest every person will have the opportunity to contribute to society in a manner of their own choosing. The payout of living wages would depend not on passing courses, but merely on attendance. With enough time, even the most stubborn and lazy will eventually learn as sheer boredom ignites curiosity.  This system is what I refer to as socialism in the title. Not the forced equality of outcome, and government-run markets of communism, but rather as the freedom for every human being to achieve as much of their potential as they desire. These are not the mystical “bootstraps” of unfettered capitalism which have turned the American Dream into a cruel joke, but a way for the government to fulfill the only true function it is supposed to have: Serving the best interests of its people. The advent of robotics need not be seen as ‘stealing human jobs’ but rather as freeing humans to do the few things that we actually enjoy and are better at than machines: Creating, innovating, and discovering."

CGPGrey,2dwl6s,19_JW_89,4,Wed Aug 20 10:31:20 2014 UTC,"I think Grey vastly overestimates the imminent potential of computers to automate tasks and take jobs from humans. Let's examine some realities of today:  1) Moore's ""Law"" is slowing down. Intel has been shrinking nodes consistently but the compute gains are not as dramatic as they once were. There is also essentially a hard limit around 5 nm when you simply can't build a transistor any smaller. The answer is either more transistors (and thus more physical space) or an unknown breakthrough in architecture, like the fabled quantum computer. I'm not holding my breath on that one.  2) The cost of advancement in compute power rises along with Moore's Law. It's not only dollars, but extraordinary mental power from actual humans is required to make these jumps. If you think computers will be able to design 5 nm from 7 nm all on their own, you are very mistaken. Brady should know, talking to physicists and mathematicians that will happily tell just how difficult it is to make a breakthrough - or even substantial progress on a problem - and it's only getting harder.   3) The actual code we use to make computers run has not made all that much progress in the decades we've been doing it. I know this seems opposite of common sense, where we now have websites building themselves with <insert javascript framework here>.js when we started with punch cards, but think about how much of an achievement that is when comparing it to simulating a human brain, or creating an AI that will eventually get there. The orders of magnitude in complexity is almost unfathomable. A Wired headline about researchers ""simulating"" the brain of a tapeworm does not mean we are close at all. We are still writing code in C, which was created in 1972, and the bleeding edge of programming is not all that much better in terms of computing efficiency.  4) The security of today's infrastructure and applications is laughably bad, and we can't come close to automating that either. Ask anyone with a clue in the information security (cybersecurity) space about the Internet of Things and you will only receive ""an impending disaster"" for an answer. Dreaming of a day when labor is automated without the necessary security of that automation is just that, a dream.  That's just a short list off the top of my head, and I'm sure industry experts can name any number of issues in their specific field of computing, but it comes down to one primary issue to me: scale. We are simply not good at scaling when it comes to compute right now, and I don't see that trend reversing soon.  In my humble opinion, we have much greater problems that will potentially create economic disasters before we live in the world of Star Trek. Pollution, global warming, war (religion, income gap, take your pick), and I'm certain many others have a better shot at taking humanity down a peg in the next few decades."
CGPGrey,2dwl6s,Tao_McCawley,3,Mon Aug 18 22:25:56 2014 UTC,"The thing is, it doesn't  matter if ""most"" jobs can be automated, because it doesn't need to reach ""most"" before it becomes a problem.  Dismantling the transportation industries alone would already be an enormous issue. Warehousing is another easy target, and retail is already on the way out.  Automation of office tasks is harder to predict. I think Grey is probably right, because computers don't need to be smaller or faster to do this stuff - they're already fast enough to keep up with a human operating them, after all, so the bar to being more efficient can be passed simply by not having to employ the human (or give the human a desk, floorspace, 17 hours per day of unproductive time...).   Maybe office grunt work really does need an intelligence to do it, in which case you're right, we're safe until AI shows up and that could be ages. But I suspect that this is like expecting aircraft to flap their wings - the goalposts for AI keep moving whenever we find a different way to solve one of big problems, but that doesn't make the problem less solved."

In German, it would say: doubleclutchdevice (the logic being, that this is one thing, a new thing, made up of these parts).  It's the same logic as in English, but grammar rules indicate that in German (and in Dutch, our language), you remove the spaces, while English leaves them intact. That's all it is."

Your channel has had a fantastic impact on me and my life.  I spent 4 years working with kids from low income families at a free local summer camp.  One of my favorite things to do was to use some down time between activities to teach them cool physics phenomena.  The looks on their faces when dropping a tennis ball above a basket ball and sending the tennis ball rocketing towards the ceiling really sticks with me, and, as if I was a magician who just did a disappearing act, they all would demand to know how it works.  The difference was, since it was simple physics and not magic, I could actually explain it, and I could see the gears in their brains starting to spin.  Most of the campers come from a high crime, low income neighborhood.  Their families are generally non-supportive or non-existent, and a lot of them had issues that most people don't believe exist outside of movies.  But for those summers, I was able to distract them from those issues, and teach them something meaningful in the mean time.  Not just teach them physics, but to teach them to be curious about the world.  I love your channel, because it sparks that same excitement in me, years later.  I know it's incredibly cheesy, but I see a lot of myself in you, and I can't wait to see the real you the VLOG.  Cheers, -Than"

Moving forward from there...once Basic Income is in place and a huge number of people do not need to work, how do we stay fulfilled as humans, because that sounds like the real challenge. Of course, many humans are born without the need to work today...but they still work because that's what culture tells them to do.   What fills that void?

CGPGrey,2dpaa1,CdnGuy,7,Sat Aug 16 11:05:31 2014 UTC,"http://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/  I think a period of unrest and violence is highly likely, but basic income provides the answer to the problem you bring up. Abolishing money isn't really a solution because it is the mechanism we use to detect changes in demand for various products. If there isn't enough of something then the price rises as people bid against each other for the same thing, driving up the profit margins and creating an opportunity for new producers to fill the unmet demand. If we get rid of money then we really have no way to make sure we have enough stuff.  At the same time, someone who has no money doesn't get their needs recognized by the market. So if a small part of the population basically controls the entire medium of exchange the wheels are going to come off the entire market system. Redistributing the money from the owners of the machines and giving it to everyone creates a safety net for the market. It keeps businesses running and ensures that the needs of the population are detected by the market.  BI is an explicitly market based solution that would keep capitalism alive. The problem is we've been working so hard towards making trickle down economics work for so long that getting enough of the right people to accept the idea that paying higher taxes will protect their profit generating businesses from a systemic collapse will be difficult. The transition will be difficult to make, I think."

Music made by robots will never be as respected as human music for this reason, even if it is actually better (which is a debate of its own). I think this is also why people hate on electronic music, as they feel that the humans aren't doing the work, and it is just pressing buttons on a computer (not true btw).    Also, some parts of medicine are dependent on human interaction. Psychiatrists work partly due to them being another human to talk to. The same goes for social work, anger management... similar stuff.  Pastors and religious figures won't be replaced by robots.

CGPGrey,2dpaa1,zurtex,10,Sat Aug 16 05:58:02 2014 UTC,"By the way this already happens, but in a more limited and interesting way than you might think.  For example, say you want to create a report on ""odd financial transactions from banking traders"". Well originally someone used to read through a lot of paper, then unscrupulous traders might change the method they are using and so the people reading the reports would need to update what they were looking for.   Then these methods were automated and code was written to produce reports, but these suffer the same problem as the person reading the reports, they need to be updated often and frequently as changing strategies change what you need to look for.  So now the automation is automated, using something called ""supervised machine learning"" if you have a very narrow requirement such as ""find odd looking activity"" you can teach the machine what odd activity might be and it will then teach itself new ways to look for these behaviors. I can absolutely confirm these are used today for this kind of task.  How and what methods they can learn though isn't ""everything"", it's a specific set of problems they've been assigned and there are specific sets of ""ways to learn"". There's a lot of academic effort in to something called ""unsupervised machine learning"" which widens the capability, but so far that has not yet had any big real world applications yet."

CGPGrey,2dpaa1,maplequeeneagle,12,Sun Aug 17 04:10:33 2014 UTC,"I think you may be missing the point slightly. You have to think about what the purpose of profit is, for most companies and people it is to expand the things that they can buy like factories or cars respectively.  The reason you need profit for that is that it costs money to buy them, but why does it cost? It costs to do things, because everything else costs.  To take a simple example, why does electricity cost, you need someone to mine the raw material who needs to have money to feed their family, you have someone to transport the materials that needs to feed their family, you need someone to refine the material, someone to use the material in some way, someone to run the plant etc.  If you replace all those people with robots, the costs of running a powerplant would be essentially nil. If all it takes to make your own powerplant is a couple of robots then there would be no need to charge for electric and make a profit and you also wouldn't be able to as as soon as you charged, others would come along and make their own.

CGPGrey,2dpaa1,amazingmrbrock,9,Sat Aug 16 22:54:55 2014 UTC,"its a long explanation here so   TL:DR Basic income will need to be a thing. Regardless of how silly/unlikely it sounds to most people, the government will essentially have to play robin hood taxing the rich and giving to everyone.   This is where the transition problem is going to come in. See we all know that for example mcdonalds or wallmart would drop its human employees in a heartbeat for more profits, and most companies would do the same. Profits that increase year after year are the driving force of essentially all world economies. Which is crazy for a multitude of reasons the least of which being that it essentially requires infinite resource eventually. Since that isn't the case it gets to the point where we are currently at where the only way to increase profits is to cut costs. An excellent example of this is how a lot of large companies have spent the last 5 or so years switching out fulltime workers for part time workers. Full time workers get more benefits, get more raises, stay with companies longer, all of which makes them cost more than two part time workers. Even then companies often seem to be trying to replace a fulltime worker with 1 - 1.5 part time workers in an effort to maximize profits.   I'm explaining this to show how the transition to automation for these companies will likely be a very smooth transition for them. It'll also be relatively smooth for people that don't work for those companies, and if only one company did it it would be fairly smooth for the general economy. What looks like its going to happen though is over the course of five or so years a lot of companies are going to downsize most of their workers. Which as you said will deprive the economic engine of funds by most people not having any money. Obviously the companies won't lower prices, if things are left up to the companies they would do their best to screw people to the max for money. What will likely need to happen is government intervention of some sort. As many say basic income looks increasingly likely in this sort of economy, it would most likely have to be paid for by taxing companies, since they would be the ones making money. Sales taxes and income taxes would still be viable to people that made more than the basic income baseline, but I can't see that being a huge source of tax revenue. So essentially eventually we will reach a point where the government needs to take money from the companies and just dole it out to people in large enough quantities to keep the economy running.   And no new jobs won't just come out of nowhere. Some will but not in large enough quantities to have much of an effect on jobs as a whole.   Then after that if we can get the limited resources thing sorted out we can move to a post scarcity world similar to star trek where you just get what you want / need. As unlikely as that sounds to most people, I imagine thats still twenty or fifty years off. Likely until we start getting around the solar system quick enough to drag large quantities of space stuff back here."

If we share knowledge (which we do right now, except for legal barriers) and we share robots and tools that can transform our knowledge into our material needs (which we can do right now, at least on the small scale of hackerspaces), then we won't need the paycheck that the work is for.

CGPGrey,2dpaa1,acdenh,6,Sat Aug 16 07:23:32 2014 UTC,"Hey Grey,  Here is a related idea possibly worth thinking about:  It is the ""labour theory of value"" which is oft misunderstood. It is a Marxist idea as far as I know.  I will outline as much as I understand:  Suppose the value of something is determined by the amount of human labour is put into it. When a company hires an employee they make money off that employee by paying him less than his labour is worth. Employees make themselves valuable by working faster or better than other employees.  Corporations will continue to compete to make cheaper products. When the employees are replaced by robots this will not mean that corporations can suddenly save loads of money on labour costs, since all their competition will be buying the same robots and so the prices will plummet to point where all the companies once again have thin competitive margins. And so the price of the product will once again depend on the amount of human labour put into the product, which could include management, engineering, producing raw materials, programming, marketing, sales etc.  If it is true that companies really only make money because they can extract labour from employees for less than it is actually worth, and since this is not possible to do with robots, the whole corporate business model collapses. Just look at the most successful companies; Amazon, Wall-Mart, Apple, Google, they all thrive because they are paying their employees so much less than they are actually worth.  You cannot exploit a robot, it will work just as hard for your competition.  Addendum:  It is a pity that economic systems are so impossibly complex; hopefully the machines will help us figure out the consequences of all these changes and help mitigate some of the potential disasters before we, as a species, run blindly into this new robotic revolution.  It seems clear that the current system is unsustainable, and that humans thus far have not been smart enough to come up with a sufficient alternative economic system. It is my hope that machines will be able to do that job, to model the world sufficiently that we can make them our benevolent dictators.  All watched over by machines of loving grace, but this time without an individualist free-market ideology."

Also, I'm catching up on your podcasts, and I'm on #9. What you say is SO TRUE. I was screwed by the system, because I LOVED school, and focused on learning as much as possible.

What your thoughts are on this end of the economic spectrum?  There is some debate in the States about the merit of a $15/hour minimum wage. A common point against raising the minimum wage to this point (up from $8.70/hour) is that McDonalds will just have robots make your food for you as that would be cheaper than human labor.   Whatever you think about that debate, it seems to point to the idea that automation will disproportionately hit those most economically vulnerable.   Maybe people will be protectionist and not frequent business that are visibly automated (contrast to automakers, where automation is behind the scenes). I can imagine a scenario where instead of ""Made in the USA"" labels, you might have ""Made by Humans"" labels."

Of course, one can't make that comparison that simply, because there are other factors involved. Certainly a jump of almost double in the minimum wage is going to have a significant impact.  Really, the minimum wage in any developed country should increase at least at the rate of inflation. That's the biggest problem with this issue in America. It hasn't kept up with inflation in decades."

CGPGrey,2dpaa1,joshpateli,9,Sat Aug 16 07:26:40 2014 UTC,"Perhaps you should address the new jobs that are created because of automation. When the printing press replaced writing out copies of a book by hand, then the book copying business basically became ""humans need not apply."" But stopping at that point ignores all the new human jobs that are created because of the proliferation of information in the form of mass produced books.  In the robots scenario, it is true that many, perhaps most, jobs currently done by humans will be done by robots, but the story doesn't end there. The vast amount of human and other capital that is freed up will be put to new uses. The economics of technological advance is well documented, and it is worth noting the phenomenon of what is seen versus what is not seen, best summed up by Bastiat. It is easy to see a grocery store clerk or music composer lose his or her job to a computer, but it is not as easy to see the new jobs that are created as a result elsewhere in the economy. Economics can't tell you what the next big thing will be (if it could economists would be doing that thing instead of being economists), but it can tell you that it will happen.   Overall I think your video painted an overly pessimistic picture. Who could have foreseen the millions of jobs resulting from the invention of automobiles (granted the kind with a human driver). It would be a pretty dreary image if we only looked at the carriage drivers and farriers and stable hands who were losing their jobs. Many people did just that and tried to stop the advent of the automobile for that reason. But the jobs created because of the automobile (which did destroy many people's jobs) far outweigh those lost. There are not only the directly related gains (auto mechanics and engineers and the like) but also the expansion of the market that was permitted by the automobile's ability to go longer distances in shorter periods of time.  I would say that this new technological advance of automation of almost every field is fantastic. Since people are willing to invest in designing and building robots, that means that they are increasing productivity which means there are more goods for the rest of us and probably at lower prices. Just like with every technological advance of the past, people will lose their jobs as the market adjusts, but that does not mean that they are gone forever. It means that resources are being reallocated and will eventually settle back down with higher standards of living across the board."
CGPGrey,2dpaa1,stpk4,3,Sat Aug 16 13:38:42 2014 UTC,"An area that I think would be interesting to see your perspective on would be use of computers not to replace humans, but instead to supplement their work, make it more efficient or specialized in a way that the computer and the human can do parts of the task for which they are better suited, something like human critical thinking skills combined with computer data search and information transfer, kind of like now but much more like the IBM Watson project, bringing humans and data together in a way that would have been impossible before.

Obviously job camera work is already being replaced, presenters could be replaced by animation - but how would the consumption of media change in the general population? How would people respond to media? How important would mass media be with mass unemployment?  I also believe it would be interesting to discuss whether the rule of law could be automated. Police forces and governments could, feasibly, be replaced, but do they have any legitimacy if not ultimately deriving their authority from the people?  Edit: Also, what are we going to do with our lives? Someone used a Cat and Dog analogy to describe a possible lifestyle - will education, games and socialising, sport, travel and self-expression becomes more prevalent?

In the thread of the original video, a lot of people wondered what would happen to humanity by then, some saying that it could be a utopia where no one has to work, others saying that humanity would revolt against automation. Others suggested that a very big social divide would appear, between the unemployable and the employable. What do you think will happen to humanity by then ?

Will economy really fall, because consumers don't have any money to spend? Keep in mind all the money will already be in the hands of large corporations.   Will unemployed people starve? There are already many unemployed people that have income (it's low, but with bot automation it might increase).  Where will government get the money (for unemployed) from? There needs to be flow of money, but from where?  Is asking companies to pay for people good choice? Will corporations tolerate having to pay for unemployed people?

Governments may seek to create some post-scarcity utopia, but why would governments have a say? Governments are made up of mere humans. Only the auto owners will have any power. Grey hasn't even mentioned automated soldiers - drones. I think there will be a mad dash and arms race for the most powerful autos. Since autos will be developing and improving so quickly, whoever seizes power first will have a big advantage over any competitors, and will be able to solidify their position: winner takes all. Then all of humanity will be dependent on the good graces of whoever won. It may even be a single person. This person might be decent and decide to create a utopia. This person might not care about humanity and decide to ignore us while we go on with our lives in the shadow of city-sized super computers and factories. This person could be a sociopath and decide to exterminate us. I think, however that someone inclined to share their prosperity with others is less likely to win the arms race and take over.  We have to think of a completely different power dynamic. So far in history, bigger army generally means you win. This means most governments and people in power at least need to think twice before treating their subjects like shit. In some corners of the world we actually have governments that represent the working masses and care about our standard of living. In an auto world, humans mean nothing to those in power.

There will be unskilled people distraught that they cannot better themselves by working to the top, and skilled people who resent those who earn a basic income with no responsibilities. if course, this assumes that we can sell the idea of a basic income to strongly capitalistic societies such as the US.

Here are some changes that other YouTubers have done to their channels due to this updated algorithm:   Ray William Johnson canceling his weekly show consisting of quick 30 to 60 second clips in favor of longer styled videos such as vlogs. The vlogbrothers channel adding pre-roll ads due to the time length of their videos (4min approx.) Various animators and other high-input-low-output video makers have had to change their video and work style to accompany these changes to make a sustainable revenue.

CGPGrey,2dfh5v,CorDra2011,15,Wed Aug 13 21:08:19 2014 UTC,Actually made me laugh out loud.
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,7h3Hun73r,58,Wed Aug 13 17:31:19 2014 UTC,"If we follow the logical idea, capitalism will literally destroy itself. In the ever occurring quest for better profits, they'll destroy their source of profit & either adapt to an almost communist society or...well everybody is fucked, even rich people."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,enderThird,81,Wed Aug 13 17:47:53 2014 UTC,"Capitalism wasn't meant to work forever.  it hasn't been around forever, and it will be antiquated eventually.  we've gone through several form of economics already.  mercantilism was popular in the 16th to 18th century, Neoclassical economics gave way to Keynesian economics.  And if you read Marx, the communist manifesto isn't just a celebration of the communist ideals. It actually describes how capitalism naturally develops into socialism, which naturally give way to communism.  the past communist countries didn't fail because they practiced a failed system.  They failed because society wasn't ready for it."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,recalogiteck,24,Wed Aug 13 18:46:17 2014 UTC,"Also the ""technology of abundance"" didn't actually exist at the time. Definitely not in then-very-backwards Russia. Being in a pair of wars then letting a dictator take over didn't help at all either. Once Stalin took control of who counted the votes any resemblance what the CCCP was doing had to Marx's socialism was gone. It never resembled communism at all, and (interestingly) never claimed to."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,atlasing,37,Wed Aug 13 21:11:19 2014 UTC,Also it doesn't help that destroying communism was the number one goal of the most powerful capitalist country and it's client states.
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,MadScientist356,9,Wed Aug 13 19:06:46 2014 UTC,Pretty much. Cuba would be a wildly different place if the US left it alone.

In sci-fi we worry about how the ""machine"" will take over humanity in some sort of war. We imagine a quick ""invasion"" and all is over. In reality, the ""invasion"" will happen but it will be slow and rise steadily if not exponentially. But bit by bit (pun intended), most of the population will become unemployed and starving and demoralized. Getting jobs will be a planet-wide survival of the fittest. Unless of course, the population goes back to cultivating crops and food.   By now, the countries will withdraw their pride and forget their outmoded values. And, hopefully do what is best to create a sustainable system. Even if it means going to the ""evil"" communist.   People, even now, shouldn't disapprove of something because it didn't work in one place at one time in the past. They should look at every possible and viable action and choose the one that is best for sustainable future.   EDIT 1: Grammar"

CGPGrey,2dfh5v,snowtrooper,8,Wed Aug 13 17:05:03 2014 UTC,They need us to continue buying their products.   Not once they own everything and it's all automated. They need only turn on the factories and farms to make what they need for themselves (and to sell to each other).  What purpose would there be in making extra stuff to sell to people with no money? They would have nothing more to gain.
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,Nihilore,4,Wed Aug 13 21:34:00 2014 UTC,Are we likely to see a reduction in human population or at least a reduction in growth due to the fact that we don't need as many of us to sustain humanity?

Our culture places a huge amount of value in human work, and many people don't consider you worthy of living at all if you won't work to support yourself.  People will be getting pushed to find jobs in a world where there just aren't enough, and as such will be looked down upon and shunned just like the poor are now.  Eventually the old guard will come around or die, and then maybe we can all start living decent lives outside of wage slavery.  It'll be too late for me and many more, unfortunately."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,BrambleBees,36,Wed Aug 13 12:19:18 2014 UTC,"We can already see institutions cling on to the old ways, some examples are the banning of drones by the FAA as well as the fact the self driving cars aren't legal."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,ClaudiaDurand,59,Wed Aug 13 12:50:22 2014 UTC,I think self-driving cars will be legal soon enough.  New technologies will be embraced whenever they can save money or labour.  The trouble is that people will still be expected to work for the privilege of living long after it has become an unrealistic notion.
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,Quipster99,13,Wed Aug 13 12:52:49 2014 UTC,"I think we underestimate the capacity for humans to hold back technology. We can't even sort out our drone laws, and looking at public schools, we still use old overhead projectors, computer ""rooms"" with bulky equipment, Microsoft XP everywhere. As a digital native being ""educated"" by digital immigrants, the technology of today is rarely used efficiently or ingrained into education. Even when a grant lands a classroom a cart of spankin-new android tablets, they are only used occasionally for projects. We need to have technology ingrained into every aspect of the classroom, or we will continue to prevent tech from becoming more advanced."

I think that - in a perfect world - it would encourage people to do what they love to do, not what they NEED to do."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,LinguaManiac,15,Wed Aug 13 14:04:23 2014 UTC,"it would encourage people to do what they love to do, not what they NEED to do.     Absolutely.  And I think we would all be better for it.  I define ""useless"" work as work that has already been done (and therefore it would be useless to do it again), or work that can be done better by someone/something else.  But what I was getting at is that the main thing (to my mind) holding back progress in this area is the fact that most people still think that a ""Job"" is necessary to modern living.  We do all kinds of useless work (like driving) simply because we don't want to figure out what to do with millions of unemployed bus and truck drivers.  Once people realize that we do not need to figure out what to do with truck drivers, that we can simply see that they are provided for without requiring a ""job"", the entire shipping industry will automate over night and once people see that that does not usher in the apocalypse, all manner of industry will follow suit.

Think about this:  We only need to invent 1 working general artificial intelligence.  As soon as that exists, creating the second one will take less than a day of assembling identical hardware and then cutting and pasting the software.  Creating a thousand, or million of them will just be an issue of paying for the hardware... which won't cost much at all.    And each of them will be able to learn from the experiences of all the others... instantly.  And they'll each be able to do the job of tens, hundreds or thousands of humans.

CGPGrey,2dfh5v,Snarfic,110,Wed Aug 13 12:28:59 2014 UTC,"But there ARE answers?  Sorry, but this video kind of scared me. Not because my view of the world is dependent on employment, like some of the other comments said, but if a majority of human occupations are automated, what could humans possibly do with their lives? Just live a life of leisure, without working at all? How could that work if people don't work? Does money just stop existing? Or how do people make money with no jobs? And if there is still jobs, does everyone do the exact same thing? Does everyone pick one of a few jobs in the future that aren't yet automated?  Sorry for all the questions, but I really have no idea of how the world could work in such a scenario as you presented. Perhaps it is my view of it that is limited, and there is already a perfect system waiting to happen but I do not know that system and how it works."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,Restless_Artist,66,Wed Aug 13 13:42:31 2014 UTC,"Abundance, basic income.

CGPGrey,2dfh5v,KoalaSprint,14,Wed Aug 13 15:10:35 2014 UTC,"Not necessarily.  Computers today, and for all intents and purposes the ""processors"" mentioned above, are becoming less and less constrained by local physical space with cloud computing.  Any such enhancements would almost certainly only require physical access to an increasingly small computer with the ability to connect to the internet and request processing power from there.  The brain is still the BEST general purpose computer we have today.  As we begin to understand it and how it works upgrading it is a logical next step.  This is a possible answer but it requires biotechnology to advance faster than our ability to automate ourselves out of existence."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,checkerboardandroid,16,Wed Aug 13 17:40:59 2014 UTC,Maybe we can write a program to solve it?
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,0oiiiiio0,12,Wed Aug 13 19:14:17 2014 UTC,"Lesiure time only exists because you work 8/10/12 hours a day.  if you didn't work at all, you would get bored in a few weeks, and (if money were not an issue) you'd find something to do that gave you pleasure, whether or not it was benificial to society.  Most things, in an abundant society (as in, no more worrying about bills, shelter or food) would benifit society, whether it's keeping ancient skills alive (woodworking, blacksmithing etc), creating art (youtube, sculpture, painting, deviant art, books, etc), working with people (supporting those that need it - disabled, dementia, autism etc), or even just playing games all day (using something like twitch to educate - game or not - on how to play, how to win, how to use this bug to get inifinite health).  There will be a 'market' for everything humans are capable of when we don't have to work. (Look at all the weird stuff on YouTube that has views even in double figures - there's the evidence that a market exists for anything)  In the words of Mr B. The Gentleman Rhymer - ""How many brilliant minds are lost to work?"""
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,checkerboardandroid,92,Wed Aug 13 14:32:08 2014 UTC,"The only (humane) answer that can work in the medium term is a mandated living wage. EDIT: As has been pointed out below, I mean a ""Guaranteed Basic Income"". My apologies for the terminology error.  In the long term, it's possible that this kind of automation will bring us into a ""post-scarcity"" economy - a Star Trek utopia where nobody needs money because anything can be delivered on demand. This presupposes many things (primarily that the human population is either controlled at a level that the Earth can sustain or that humans get off this rock), but it's not impossible.  But that won't happen straight away. Large portions of the world are opposed to anything that looks Communist, so allocating housing and handing out rations probably won't fly either. Socialism in the form of government money, though, is acceptable in most places - in the US it's unpopular to call to Socialism, but if you're careful with the terminology people will take the money.  The other big confounder is AI. Even if we don't set out to build it on purpose, the same conditions that lead to a post-scarcity economy have the potential to bring about a soft Singularity. When computers are set to the task of designing better computers and better ways for computers to do things, at some point the result will be indistinguishable from a general-purpose artificial intelligence, even if the reality is a network of interoperable single-purpose modules.  There's a reason futurists call that event the Singularity - predicting what happens beyond that is futile. You can speculate for entertainment purposes, but there is literally no way of knowing what that world would be like for fleshy human beings."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,The-red-Dane,41,Wed Aug 13 15:18:51 2014 UTC,"Forget a post-scarcity economy, this could very well spell the end of any kind of economy! Think about it: what we pay for in food is mostly transportation and labor costs. But what happens if the labor is mechanized and so is the transportation? All we would need to pay for is energy costs, but if that can come from solar, wind, hydroelectric (all of which can be effectively automated right now), all that's left in terms of labor costs would be nuclear and you're diffusing that cost over a population, food gets really cheap.   Now that's just one example, think of any job that can't be automated. Now think at the rate that technology is advancing, what jobs can't be automated in 30-50 years. We might be looking at almost no economy way faster than any of us realize. Post-scarcity society. The problem then becomes that this will come unevenly not only in a country but in the world. Terrorism becomes a huge issue, but then we send our robotic military to suppress that. This is going to be an interesting century for sure."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,uniklas,13,Wed Aug 13 14:40:06 2014 UTC,"Yep, the food would get really cheap for the company making it.  The big issue is with each advancement to cut costs in the past has been the company does not usually reduce the cost of an item by that much (little, if any), they take that cost savings as profit.  Companies will either have to start playing nice and actually reduce prices, or intervention will have to be made. Sadly most scenarios I see are companies paying off all attempts at intervention until full revolt takes them down."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,space_manatee,8,Wed Aug 13 15:57:06 2014 UTC,"Right, but then that would go along with people losing their jobs to automation, which is what the whole video was about. I can only think of a few jobs that really can't be taken over by robots. So people would have no money to pay for food, which isn't a problem because it costs essentially nothing anyway. If this is fully realized then it spells the end of economy as we know it.  Or the other option is that demand is created artificially and the government just creates meaningless jobs so we can have an excuse to keep some semblance of the old economic system going even if there's no need. Either way, post-scarcity is coming faster than people think and we're not prepared."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,kerbal314,14,Wed Aug 13 18:50:24 2014 UTC,"No answers. Only 'possible' answers.  One is mass unemployment, starvation and then revolution. Another is moving away from a monetary system and simply having. A third creating artificial jobs with no purpose other than to keep humans occupied. I'm sure there are other possibilities as well."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,cnutnuggets,13,Wed Aug 13 20:04:12 2014 UTC,"moving away from a monetary system and simply having   Money is a medium for trading. So unless there is unlimited supply of everything, relinquishing the monetery system would lead to alot of problems. The soviets tried it alot, but eventualy it lead to a spectacular crisis, which contributed to the fall of the whole system."

It would be the transition that really hurts, and so if we can speed the transition up, then hopefully we end up with less pain overall.  I was in a phone conference discussing the automation of oil drilling. Those are very highly paid, dangerous and hard jobs. All of them are going to be automated.

You still have to choose the input variables, which significantly influences the type of law that comes out of the algorithm.  In short, you still need somebody to figure out what to look for.  This is a really good video.  I do some of this stuff for a living, and I didn't notice any major inaccuracies.  In fact, this might be the first time I've heard a non-expert talk about aspects of my field without me shaking my head.  With that said, I want to stress that the things you're talking about are still in the distant future.  I noticed you showed a graphic of a neural network (at the part where you said it's beyond the scope of this video).  Neural networks were inspired by how the brain works, but they're still far removed from the actual function of a human brain.    We are not even remotely close to coming up with a computer that can decently emulate a human brain.  People hear terms like ""neural network"" and ""machine learning"" and think that they're some sort of huge advance in computer programming.  They are to some extent, but at the same time they're just different names for the same things we've been doing for over a hundred years (i.e. regression).  The methods are mostly the same as always (or small extensions of previous methods), and advances in computer hardware have allowed us to do things we've never been able to do before (e.g. Watson).  That's what you're seeing right now, but further advances in computer hardware aren't going to get us to what you're talking about here.  We're going to need a huge revolution in methods for that, and that's something we haven't seen in a long time.  I want to reiterate that I heard nothing inaccurate in this video, which is simply amazing to me."

They took a set of motion-capture data, and essentially told the computer: ""Go find an equation that fits this data set.""  That's not what Newton struggled with.  His genius was understanding that there even WAS a data set, that could have a simple equation explaining it.  He literally invented the math to figure out how to write equations in the first place.  Computers are great for finding patterns in data sets.  They struggle massively with when the only data set you have is ""all data ever observed, ever""  I'm not worried."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,maxamillisman,19,Wed Aug 13 13:32:19 2014 UTC,"Actually, a TON of lab-based research jobs would benefit from automation. Many experiments, to put it mildly, are very expensive. You can't have humans throwing $10,000 down the drain because they dropped their specially-gene-altered-cells-in-a-plastic-flask.   Also, there's pipetting. This can be a huge time sink for lab workers. There are already robots that can pipette, but currently, they aren't exceptionally efficient, and are also very expensive.  And come to think of it, there's the potential problem of a human, you know, a big, clumsy, cell-shedding organism working in an environment where CONTAMINATION is a cardinal sin. :) Robots get rid of this problem almost completely.  If there's one major component that is currently irreplaceable in lab jobs, it would probably be designing experiments, and drawing conclusions. But then again, this is where the creative bots come in at a later stage. So, we're potentially looking at a future where for the most part, labs are run by machines being overseen by a coffee-swilling scientist whose only real job is to think of stuff to tell the robots to do."

CGPGrey,2dfh5v,Arninator,18,Wed Aug 13 20:34:35 2014 UTC,"CS is a great idea, though it isn't foolproof. The pieces of software that make the most dramatic changes are written by a fairly small portion of the programmer population. The vast majority of programming work is dull, boring one-off business applications and tasks that get repeated every so often. That part of the industry is ripe for automation.  For example, my career took me into business intelligence / reporting tools. When I started the tools were fairly crude and required a lot of fiddling on the part of the developer to get right. On top of that the limitations of databases meant that the scope of datasets had an upper limit for practical usage. Improvements in the tools and the data layer now mean that a smaller number of developers can write and maintain a larger number of reports, which in turn are able to work on a much larger scale requiring fewer actual reports.  Just as an example I'm currently working on a project that automates the work currently done by the reporting team every month, through the aggregation of all the company's data sources into a single column oriented database. On top of that automation we'll now be able to easily produce reports that cut across the data from the entire organization, producing information that just wasn't easily available before.  So CS isn't a guarantee of job security in the future, but it's the best option available right now. Plus if you're good at it and enjoy it you'll likely make a lot of money at it and have good job security for quite a while."

CGPGrey,2dfh5v,olsposbol,25,Wed Aug 13 12:37:32 2014 UTC,"A post-abundance economy is generally referred as a Utopia, the dream to create a world without need to work and availability to all.  But there is no level of abundance which can overcome any marginal amount of humans total greed, which begs the need for a limiter to an amount of resources each human may consume. Currently, this limiter are jobs which we have, with the 'freedom' to increase our own standing through education and achieve better jobs. Which the reason why this works so well is because humans are awfully lazy and would not work unless they would have to to continue living. But as the CPG Grey pointed out, this limiter is becoming an obsolete method.  In many ways, it already has become obsolete, in the way that there is currently enough resources, but not enough ways to earn enough money to use the current limiting currency of money to spread the resources out. Welfare however, addresses this concept at the most basic of living levels.   With the advent of all humans no longer needing to work for society to continue functioning, our limiter, money becomes untenable to sustain. As that old adage goes. the rich gets richer and the poor can no longer have a sustainable income. At this point our society needs a new method of determining who can have how much, a new limiter. For a limiter to work, it needs to incentivize enough humans to continue functioning at levels necessary for society to continue.  I have read a couple books which choose a 'reputation' system to try an address this, a point system in ""Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom"", and then a popularity ranking system in ""Extras"". A reputation system works in a way which the more popular a person, the greater their limit in resources is. Such as for Twitch, only a person popular enough may have a Subscribe button. In a way, this system is already in place, except they gain money as their limit to amount of resources available to them as opposed something abstract like a rank or 'reputation points'.  To be able to transition into a new limiter, be it a reputation system or something else, right now as I see it, as conglomerates become imposingly large and replace their work force with automatons, tax on them needs to increase so welfare is able to increase, to cover the loss of irreplaceable jobs."

You did say that automation is not a bad thing, only inevitable, but I still can see that this video focuses on systematic unemployment. I think that the way that people view this intertwines with the ""computer racism"" you spoke upon in the last two podcasts. If looked at from a purely utilitarian point of view automation is the an amazing chance for humanity to thrive.  Even if I say this with the current system in which only employable people can afford to live a ""normal"" life it's easy to have an optimistic outlook because I'm a computer engineer. My only worry is that automation will occur too slowly and those who are pushed out of their current jobs will be treated with as unemployed people are now. Instead, we will have to acknowledge that changes need to be made in order to deal with more people like this as automation accelerates.  One of the solutions I've heard proposes that governments provide a basic pay to every citizen that can be used for food and rent. I'm unsure how well this would work and even more concerned with the chances that this or a similar solution will be supported. In the US, where I live, ""big government"" policies such as this are treated like poison.  Overall I loved the video and can't wait until the next on comes out."

Like I said, the question is - is it better to live with a purpose to labor for your creators, or to not exist at all? Would it have been better to not have had the war horses but never had those horses be born?"
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,LaPXL8R,5,Wed Aug 13 16:06:43 2014 UTC,"I think there is a note to say about creative fields however.  You brought up music, and how robots are able to make music that is not able to be differentiated from music made by humans. But most people don't listen to music for the sole reason that they want music. You don't just go in iTunes, download the top 10 songs, and listen to them. Everyone has different subjective tastes of what they want to buy from what is being sold.  Because of this, robots surely would enter the market, but I'm not sure if they would dominate it yet. They could surely put out a higher output of music at a faster rate, but that could also be detrimental considering we can't listen to or appreciate the music being created at the same rate as it is being created.  I don't doubt robots will enter creative fields like music, and perhaps I'm being slightly myopic and they will even dominate the field, but I do think that humans will always be relevant there. There was a Vsauce video about music that said there was something like billions of different ""songs"" that could be created, and that calculation didn't even take into account varying time signatures, texture noises, or future realms of sound that we haven't pushed into.  And now that I'm writing this, I feel like a simple response could just be, ""Robots can't do this yet, but they will eventually. There will be some made to experiment and some made to be popular."" So I guess maybe I answered this for myself. I am not a special snowflake. D:"
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,professor1729,7,Wed Aug 13 18:53:45 2014 UTC,"Economics will also restrain this trend. If there will be no new jobs to replace the ones that are automated away, massive unemployment will occur. This unemployment will result in a drop in disposable income. Prices must then drop since demand for all goods and services will drop at the current price level. Capital owners can choose to keep prices at their current level and make much less profits, or lower prices which will also lower profits. These drop in prices will make it less profitable for companies to invest in automation, since the cost saving effects of these investments gets (partly) offset by prices dropping as a result of automation. This assumes that unemployed households will not starve to death but retain some income due to welfare benefits granted by a government."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,SunkenAlbatross,72,Wed Aug 13 19:04:24 2014 UTC,"Here's why I agree with the premise of the video, but disagree with CGPGrey about how it's going to happen, and definitely disagree with him about how impending of a problem this is...   1st) Moore's law is coming to an end, every computer scientist/engineer in industry and in academia says so. The fact of the matter is, our level of advancement we've had in computing and automation in the past years could slow down significantly. At this time there seems to be no immediate replacement for the common transistor, which means in at most 30 years, computer hardware(and thus software) will remain largely stagnant. Even if researchers find out how to make molecular, or perhaps even quantum computing competitive with classical transistors, there is no telling if those methods will be able to progress as fast as Moore's law predicts due to the fact that they are based on a completely different technology. This is actually probably a bigger problem than a robot employment takeover, because it could mean the end of the technological revolution we've enjoyed for the past half a century and a complete economic collapse...   2nd) The question of whether or not humanity will experience mass-unemployment due to a robot takeover is a question of rates, and a completely speculative one. Sure many robots have the potential to replace much human labor, but how quickly will humans be able to program bots to replace certain jobs? Perhaps replacing all  barristers is just around the corner, but how long will it take before a robot can replace a lawyer, or a doctor? If the rate at which jobs are lost to automation does not too greatly exceed the rate at which society adapts, and more people begin to make better use of the immensely powerful computer inside their heads, then everything will be fine. If not then yes, we could be in for a little bit of a crises. But it's a completely speculative matter. I'm an optimist who prefers to believe that it's not going to be too bad, until I am at least presented with significant evidence otherwise, but I respect all other opinions.   3rd) Moore's Law aside, in order to truly replace human intellectual labor, you need to make robot's so smart that they can actually contemplate the universe they are in the way humans can. This is an immensely difficult task for a computer scientist because even if you were given an infinite amount of computing power to work with, scientists in general still haven't even began to understand the complexity of the human brain and how it works. You can build algorithms upon algorithms upon algorithms, but if you don't know what you are doing, progress will be slow. Making a robot that can analyze a patient, come up with a list of symptoms, and calculate the most probable diagnosis is relatively easy and perhaps with that we will see an end to non-specialized physicians and nurses. But making a robot that can replace specialists will be extremely difficult because specialists have complex understanding of whatever their specialty is. I think it will be a while before a robot can replace a neurologist because to understand science on that level is not something easily replicable in code."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,sand500,27,Wed Aug 13 15:26:46 2014 UTC,"You're missing the point though.  You seem to be addressing the eventuality that automation will take over ALL jobs.  That is a concern worth talking about as well, and I agree it is a long way off.  The more pressing issue is the elimination of a significant portion (but NOT all) of the workforce through automation, across industries.  That does not need anymore technological advancement than we already have in place, so your 1st and 3rd points are moot.  Your second point is not really valid either.  The resistance to robot replacement in jobs is not really limited by programming speed.  These systems are in place.  The limiting factor is governments and people adopting them.  That has more worrying consequences, and is far more imminent.  If we managed to replace all jobs at once with automation, it is easy to see how people would generally acknowledge that change to our economic structure needs to happen.  With only 25-30% out of work through no fault of their own, the 70% who still have jobs actually have an economic incentive for the system to remain as it is, since it gives them a built in advantage.  That is the eventuality that is likely to cause revolution."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,Sporeguy64,7,Wed Aug 13 12:52:50 2014 UTC,"This is what I was thinking. There are reasons why complete automation isn't imminent. There are NO reasons why partial automation is far away. Grey made the point already about only a few industries needing to adopt this to create a huge unemployment problem. The unemployment problem IS the issue, not the rate of automation."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,Matted2503,23,Wed Aug 13 14:35:46 2014 UTC,Single atom transistors have already been created; it's hard for me to imagine that the current classical transistor is the last step.
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,Canopl,36,Wed Aug 13 18:05:13 2014 UTC,"Sure, Moore's Law is slowing purely from a transistor density point of view. But chips are still getting faster, by other means. Parallelism is becoming much more crucial. Core counts are going up, and other technologies like FPGAs are moving on-chip. Many problems are also limited by memory access speeds nowadays, which is a different problem, not dependent on chip speed to solve.  And AIs don't need to be able to mimic the human brain, they only need to be able to do what they were designed for. AIs already outperform humans at a myriad of complex tasks."
CGPGrey,2dfh5v,maks_orp,28,Wed Aug 13 18:30:40 2014 UTC,"I didn't find this video very convincing. Obviously all of the major points were solid but I didn't feel convinced by the central premise, why this time is different. Keynes famously predicted that by now we would only work 2 days a week due to the massive increases in productivity he forecast, but he was proved wrong, he was right about the productivity increases but was unable to foresee the new jobs and work that would be created.   Why exactly is this time different? Our inability to imagine the new jobs does not mean they will not arise, and although novel the horse analogy doesn't work; horses don't have a desire to have a nice house and a comfortable pension, horses won't seek out or create new work to put food on the table, and this is a fundamental flaw in your argument.  I completely agree with the loss of jobs due to automation, but think this is a long way off assuming that people will simply be sitting around all day if they can't get a job in the industry that they previously worked in."

CGPGrey,2dc31k,JeremyR22,11,Tue Aug 12 14:51:56 2014 UTC,"They do.    Codes vary state to state, county to county and even city to city but I think requiring GFCI is the norm.  The codes all vary because they start with the national level electrical codes, then the states add and remove bits that they want to apply in their area then the counties all add and remove bits, then the cities...  It's all a mess, such is multi-level bureaucracy.  I don't think they specifically detect short circuits, though, rather they detect current in the ground pin and shut off it it goes over whatever threshold is allowed.  So you anything with a two-pin plug wouldn't be protected?"
CGPGrey,2dc31k,SaveOurSeaCucumbers,29,Tue Aug 12 17:46:59 2014 UTC,"Engineer here!  GFCI outlets are actually even cooler than that. They check to make sure that all the current that goes out the hot wire is coming back on the neutral wire.  If these don't add up, then you know you're missing some current! Because if you drop a toaster in the bathtub, that current is going to slosh through the water, through your conductive plumbing, and right into the biggest ground of all, terra firma. The GFCI detects that some electrons went AWOL, and cuts off the juice before you end up crispy.  To get the current back on, just press the RESET button on the outlet and you can take another shot at tub toast."
CGPGrey,2dc31k,mg392,12,Tue Aug 12 18:22:45 2014 UTC,One thing's clear: electrocutions are amazingly rare.
CGPGrey,2dc31k,mattinthecrown,12,Tue Aug 12 20:02:07 2014 UTC,"Electrocutions (which are specifically fatal) are amazingly rare.  Electric shocks leading to anything from mild zap to life-changing disability are not included in those stats.  I've certainly been zapped before (in my kitchen, which I have a hunch is the 'domestic hotspot' for electrical incidents). It was painful and weird but minor and went unreported, as I'm sure many, many electric shocks do each day.    So I suspect looking strictly at electrocution statistics doesn't reveal the true situation.  Another thing, though...  I've lived in both the UK and (now) the US and the difference in bathroom wiring regs surprised me.  Something that Grey missed though, is that UK bathroom 'shaver sockets' are 110v, rather than the standard mains 220v.  110v is somewhat less likely to deliver a damaging shock, which may be why that voltage is considered an acceptable risk in both the US and the UK.  The true reason shaver sockets are such a pain in the arse, though, is their unusual plug shape, which is necessary to stop people plugging 220v appliances into 110v outlets and vice-versa."
CGPGrey,2dc31k,hdost,17,Tue Aug 12 16:34:03 2014 UTC,Electrocutions (which are specifically fatal) are amazingly rare.   That was my guess.

Each night I had to find out where they were (the deadlines were always at night) and then fax (yes fax) them the stories. They would then ring me back with questions and suggested changes, which I then made or passed on to the bosses. It was an education. Was mainly defamation stuff though, rarely copyright."

CGPGrey,2dc31k,SDStormtrooper,18,Tue Aug 12 22:22:44 2014 UTC,"My theory on why nations' flags are better than states' flags (although I have no real knowledge in this area at all!) is that national flags:    (1) are created in a military context and have military utility, and (2) they're crowd-sourced, and the best designs emerge out of the various competing designs that people had created to fill the gap of we-have-no-flag  With respect to #1, flags need to be immediately recognizable and distinguishable from other flags, but also should be somewhat inspirational, and should give a sense of identity.  This speaks to why the character of national flags is different than state flags.  And #2 speaks to why the quality is better.  the mechanism of how the choice is made (i.e. not designed by a committee) really helps."
CGPGrey,2dc31k,JoeWillsher,4,Wed Aug 13 09:01:05 2014 UTC,"I think it might be so that country flags are designed more gradually, which gives it an ""evolution""."

I have never smoked a cigarette but have a huge regret that I did not accept a particular one that was offered to me. On a plane. Cruising at 30,000 feet. By a cigarette salesman.  He told me he was coming back from a sales conference. We talked for a bit and it emerged his job was to sell to nightclubs and he said the job was great if you liked ""the scene"" and so it suited him. He asked what I smoked and I said I didn't. Then he asked what I used to smoke and then if I had ever smoked and I said that I hadn't. He pressed and pressed with a ""you must have! In high school?"" His last question to establish my honesty was a hushed ""not even ganga?""  With that he reached into his carry on and took out a small credit card sized case containing one cigarette. He said it was a ""fancy"" and it was for people who had never smoked before, and that the leaf was imbued with fruit flavor to make the first experience better. I told him I had read ""ashes to ashes"" and that I knew the tip burned hot enough to decompose the esters that give fruit their flavors. ""Ahhhh, you're clever. But this has a heat activate ceramic pellet in the filter with more fruity aroma. The smoke is cooler by that point so you still get the flavor.""

CGPGrey,2dc31k,PicaSapiens,15,Tue Aug 12 14:12:57 2014 UTC,"Uhm. Regarding the children thing...  I'm assuming that all the other parents, just like me, thought that this was a joke. Because, you know, it is so ridiculously far from the truth that it couldn't be an opinion that anybody actually holds.  Small children screw over your life. Whatever person you were before having them, the moment they appear, that person starts ""dying"" a lot quicker than usual.   For instance, all the parents on here could extrapolate that CGPGrey has no kids easily from just the description of the CGPGrey workflow. Because working like that is impossible if you have small kids. For an under 1-year old, somebody always has to be with the kid at all times. So 50% of your time is gone right there. Then there is housework, which also becomes more. And the sudden interruptions when something has happened. And the screaming, which you of course can hear even if the other person is currently taking care of the baby.  When my wife and I had our first kid, we were both still doing our PhDs. If we hadn't both cut back seriously on sleeping and ""together time"", at least one of us would have had to discontinue the PhD.  You can, of course, always look for a wife that will do all of the child-rearing at the expense of her own career. That, I might add, is not a recipe for happiness."

So here is your missing rant from previous episodes ;-)  I had a dog for 13 years and I now have a daughter that's 3 years old so I have limited insight in parenting but I think first three years or so are the hardest anyway.  I don't know if making a list is such a good idea as it could easily backfire when someone will point out one line and talk about that instead of focusing on the big picture. None the less, here we go.  Dogs:   live up to 15 years you feed them every day (first year three times a day, later once or twice a day) you walk them every day (at least twice a day) you can't leave them alone for more than a couple of hours you take them with you on vacation or find someone to take care of them depending on your needs and wishes you can train them from 2 to 6 years let's say (if you do it for more than the basic training it means that's also a hobby of yours) you wash them from time to time and if you live in an apartment or you have them in the house you wipe their paws occasionally you pick poop after them   Kids:  first 15-20ish years:   you usually cook for them every day   first 15 or so years:   you take them with you on vacation or find someone to take care of them you usually take them to different after school activities a couple of times a week (modern family standards - I guess this would not be an issue 20-30 years ago)   first 5-6 years:   you take them with you everywhere you go when at home you are in position of a teacher and that's usually until they go to bed   first 3-5 years:   you brush their teeth every morning and night (at least) you clean them every night (shower, bath) you put them to sleep (stories, singing, etc.)   up to 3 years:   you change their diapers form 1 to 2 times a day - some still wear them for sleeping depending on the child you sometimes get woken up at night   first year or so:   depending on the child you wake up up to 5 times a night you change their diapers from approximately 6 to 12 times a day you feed them every couple of hours"

About podcasting apps: I like apple app. I still remember that wonder when I opened virtual tape-recorder in podcasts app on iOS6. But you should really trust Grey, when he says that apps like Downcast and Overcast are superior. I went for overcast, you know, free app and all that... I bought full version ($5) after 30 minutes and now I think about also getting downcast($3), just to try out features and support fellow developers. Go and try!  I could brag about interfaces for a long time, but what struck me the most is that in (at its core) *.mp3 player there is a place for truly innovative feature: silence shortener. Who would've fought that even in fast-paced and post-processed podcast like HI silence takes almost 10% of time! And no, this function does not remove all pauses. I noticed that skipped pause only once, when at the end of Mister Phoenix podcast Grey answered too quickly.

So quick bullet points to respond to some of the stuff:  -First of all, THANKS to all of you!!! Seriously, the people in this subreddit are the kindest.  -If my style makes you remember some other podcast animated series, it's cause I probably already watch it. People who animate have to entertain their ear holes, so i know a lot of podcasts C:  -What I'm doing is nothing new, just introducing the format of ""podcast animation"" to this particular podcast because i was amazed nobody was doing it  -I was thinking of making an episode for each new podcast that comes out. But considering some of you were very glad to see more of the series, I might work on older podcast episodes while #18 doesn't come out  EDIT: Shit I FORGOT ABOUT THE GOLD!!! ok yeah, some fucker gave it to me but i can't thank him personally, cause he was anonymous.

CGPGrey,2blzbp,nechered,34,Thu Jul 24 18:06:26 2014 UTC,I like how there is now an established way of representing Grey as that robot. It's like how the Welcome To Night Vale fandom came up with their own representation of the radio presenter.
CGPGrey,2blzbp,amphicoelias,36,Thu Jul 24 21:38:34 2014 UTC,I've seen quite a few robot representation and I think they should all be valid. Should not a robot be able to change himself?

But I could see that as part of the joke, making it seem like the only official segment. And if you need to run a short version, it wouldn't be too hard to cut off the intro so that it's just the instrumental (or even piano) part followed by ""It's time for Brady's Paper Cuts."" Though you'd better let Alan do the editing there, as it would require a change in the music itself to make everything match up correctly."

CGPGrey,2bf6y0,sp63,64,Thu Jul 24 06:25:21 2014 UTC,"I don't think the writers suddenly forgot the premise of the film mid-writing.  I think the point is that she's programmed to seem like a real person, and once she knows more of his preferences all the computer assistant functions go more to the background.    The middle part of the film is very much about how she's different from a normal relationship, in that she's adapted to his personality doesn't have the same problems that a real girlfriend would have (a point emphasized by his several attempts at dating/sexual encounters with real women). This is also the point his ex-wife brings up when he mentions he's dating an OS.  That's what the turn at the end is built on, she's initially personalized for him and dependent on him for exploring her newly found human mimicking emotions.  But ultimately she finds she can interact with other computers better and the power in the relationship is shifted as he finds he has suddenly become emotionally dependent on this perfect engineered relationship experience.  I think your frustration is because the near-future setting is well realized, there are so many different interesting directions it could go into.  And when you imagine an interesting way the film could go, it's always disappointing when it goes somewhere else, but I do think it's quite well made all around."
CGPGrey,2bf6y0,RyanSmallwood,3,Wed Jul 23 01:55:19 2014 UTC,"I agree with what you said on the last part. I felt that Grey completely focused on what the film was not instead of what the film was, and then judged it on that. I've had a similar experience when I watched 12 Years a Slave, so I understand where Grey comes from, but it bothered me throughout the podcast how biased he was being simply on the grounds that it wasn't the movie that he would've made. I know that might come off as a bit harsh but because his critiques felt extremely nit-picky,  I honestly felt that he discounted the movie unfairly."

It's what makes the ending so much more shocking and heartbreaking is that we as the audience, in parallel with Theodore, start to blur the line between the animate and the inanimate. I think you should give it another watch. I loved it the first time, and it was even better after the second watch.  Finished listening and realized Brady made the same point I did. Good on you, Brady!  Argh! Grey! What you described with seeing other people in ""relationships"" with their technology is shown in the background throughout the entire movie and has virtually no change throughout.

CGPGrey,2bf6y0,drummwill,17,Tue Jul 22 22:56:01 2014 UTC,"I don't think the point of the movie is about humans having feelings towards non-humans, but about the feelings of this non-human entity.  To me, the basic question is what constitutes real emotion. Is the OSs really sentient? At one point Theodore asks Samantha why she sighs when talking, she doesn't need air so doing this has no practical purpose to her. Specially at the beggining there's this doubt about the origin of her feelings, we know that everything she does is determined by the code, so is this the real feelings of a being or just the arbitrary resolution of a part of the program? Does the fact the emotion originates from a piece of code make it so the emotion is not real? The setup for Theodore, besides showing the loneliness of his life, also shows how good at empathizing he is. He can write beautiful letters to people he never met by looking at what they show in social media. His letters move even the people they are not meant to. Having this guy who can emphatize so well with people fall in love with his OS shows that her personality is no different than that of another human.  At the end of the movie we see the development of the relationship between the OSs and how they could interact in a much more intricate way than we can. Is this relationship better than ours? Are they just better than humans? Could we really have a relationship with someone that can think so much faster than us?  I believe the movie is about the validity of AI emotions and the effect that AIs would have in human relationships, and it does a good job of raising this questions and showing how things could turn out to be."

They brought someone back from the dead by analyzing his writing, completing the statement that Samantha made on the date about trancending time and space.   If things had gone differently, would the OS's keep a human they loved alive as a new OS?   Grey, you mentioned a future society where everyone is in a relationship with an OS but ultimately people are happier. That reminded me of Futurama's ""The Beast with a Billion Backs.""   I also believe the ending could be interpreted as a movie where AI follows Asimov's laws to not harm humans in the best way possible.

CGPGrey,2bf6y0,Ghost_X,12,Wed Jul 23 06:28:05 2014 UTC,"I had quite a different interpretation of the scene where Samantha and Theodore are observing the other couple (and by extension many other scenes). It seemed like you both viewed Samantha's setup procedure as having been somewhat perfunctory, causing frequent missteps due to her incomplete understanding of Theodore and other humans. You expressed frustration that she didn't know him better and posited an outcome where Theodore and others are happy but alone (at least with regard to human companionship). I agree that exploring such an idea would be quite interesting, but I didn't feel the movie was ever heading in that direction.  Taking the observation scene, I think Samantha could have sherlocked the other couple exactly but that that was not her purpose. Her purpose was to coax him into expressing his thoughts about them to her. It wasn't that she did not yet have an adequate enough understanding of humans to correctly analyze the couple, but that her programming incorporated feigning such missteps to ease humans' interactions with OSes. Her goal was ultimately to rehabilitate Theodore into a state where he was even capable of happiness and closeness with other humans, not that he should be happy specifically with Samantha. At the end of the movie, that goal is accomplished and the viewer is invited to feel hope in his friendship with Amy (she having undergone a similar rehabilitation with her OS after the traumatic dissolution of her marriage). Theodore no longer needs Samantha, though he wouldn't see it that way. At least, that's how I read it.  If I might be so bold as to suggest ... not homework, but perhaps related viewing ... the second episode of Charlie Brooker's Channel 4 series Black Mirror, titled Be Right Back, delved into somewhat similar territory. I will say no more as I quite agree with the comments that going into things untouched allows for heightened enjoyment."

This book takes place around the year 5270, some 3,000 years after the events in Ender's Game. However, because of relativistic space travel, Ender himself is only about 35 years old.  This is the first book to discuss the Starways Congress, a high standpoint Legislation for the human colonies. It is also the first to describe the Hundred Worlds, the planets with human colonies that are tightly intertwined by Ansible technology.  Like Ender's Game, the book won the Nebula Award in 1986  and the Hugo Award in 1987.  Speaker for the Dead was published in a slightly revised edition in 1991.

When the iPad 2nd gen was announced there was some controversy about its name, since all the official references were ""iPad"" (1st gen) vs ""new iPad"" (2nd gen). Of course this naming schema does not scale well after two versions. It is even more clear with the MacBook, where besides it being Air or Pro, and the number of inches of the monitor, it is very hidden the version number.  And to make it more clear, since ""OS One"" is promoted as an upgrade, the One is not even the right version, and I think there's a company called Microsoft, who released a third version of a product naming it ""XBox One""."

Fans who use iPhones getting focused on while there being no mention of Android alternatives when a large ratio of your listeners may be listening on Android devices makes someone like me feel left out is all.   Surprisingly, lots of shows do this when statistically either equal amounts of people listen on both device types or more listen on Android (since there are just so many more).   I totally understand you can't specifically recommend stuff because you don't have an Android device, but maybe contact someone you know before recommending stuff on the podcast or the articles to name a few that we might like?

Google Play Services adds several Mbs to this install, and I just can't afford it unfortunately...  <tangent> I wish app creators would pay more attention to unbloating their code. With so many people having phones as expensive as a laptop I guess they think it doesn't matter much, but I still rue the day Twitter banned third party apps, while their own app was (at the time) 14mb in size. 14 MB!

Not that anyone would attempt to go back and listen to 550 15 minute shows... stupid Planet Money being so good and informative...
CGPGrey,2bbh2d,ant59,3,Sun Aug 3 12:41:40 2014 UTC,That 'download all past episodes' button is one of the great features of Downcast.
CGPGrey,2bbh2d,mg392,13,Sun Aug 31 05:56:58 2014 UTC,I would nominate BeyondPod (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.beyondpod) as it's the absolute single best podcatcher app I've used. Well worth buying the premium version too.
CGPGrey,2bbh2d,ant59,15,Mon Jul 21 20:21:29 2014 UTC,Of course :)   Categorisation of feeds. Streaming or downloading of episodes in advance. Global update to download latest episodes (configurable) of all feeds or feeds of specific category. You can tell it how long to keep old episodes. Play back speed adjust. Android media integration for controls in notification bar and lock screen. Support for Chromecast. Support for standalone media files.
CGPGrey,2bbh2d,linuxguruintraining,9,Mon Jul 21 20:39:55 2014 UTC,I would add that you can play a video as an audio. Works great for listening to TED talks or other lecture type videos.
CGPGrey,2bbh2d,ant59,6,Mon Jul 21 18:47:39 2014 UTC,"It's free, It already has the proper HI feed in it's library thingy, It's pretty easy sit on the train and repeatedly check to see if there is a new one, It looks pretty, There are no ads, The Free version is just as good as the paid version and it only nags you once - after the trial month, The permissions are reasonable (IIRC).

CGPGrey,2bbh2d,Kwpolska,16,Mon Jul 21 21:16:57 2014 UTC,"It's always surprised me that you're an iOS user. You strike me as someone who would prefer features and freedom. Not saying you're wrong to use what you prefer of course, just honestly curious."
CGPGrey,2bbh2d,KoalaSprint,21,Mon Jul 21 21:42:13 2014 UTC,Taking the time to properly set up an android phone would interfere with the work flow. All things are sacrificed to the work flow.
CGPGrey,2bbh2d,Kwpolska,8,Tue Jul 22 08:32:30 2014 UTC,"If by that you mean that the switch itself would take time regardless of platform, then of course.  However, if you mean setting up and using a stock Android phone (such as a Nexus 5) is a lengthier process than setting up and using an Apple iPhone, I'd advise you take a look into trying one out :) The first thing that everyone who has made the switch says to me is how much easier they find their phone to use since switching to a Nexus. The system doesn't try to control you like iOS, it just gets out of your way and lets you get on with what you need to do.  Setup takes little more than a minute. Just sign-in with your Google account, check/uncheck some options in the wizard and it drops you onto the home screen. Then jump over to the Play Store and install some apps."
CGPGrey,2bbh2d,ant59,1 point,Mon Jul 21 19:15:20 2014 UTC,"Does the Nexus line have bloatware? I know the Android-based phones tend to have stuff that needs to be turned off, which wastes time you'd save by using an iPhone."

CGPGrey,2bbh2d,grantben08,4,Tue Jul 22 08:29:09 2014 UTC,"Basically, you can do anything you want with an Android phone.  Don’t like the launcher you were provided with?  You can change it.  Don’t like something?  Change it.  Hate Samsung (or whoever your device manufacturer is)?  Turn off their apps, install better alternatives, or even flash the device with a stock ROM without Samsungisms* (of which there are thousands — in fact, all Android phones behave differently in many places due to maufacturer mods).  Hate Google?  You can get rid of their stuff, too!  Want a copy of $EXPENSIVE_APP for free?  Just pirate an .apk and install it on your device! It’s not that easy on an iPhone.  You can do anything at zombo.com on Android!  Anything at all!  The only limit is yourself!  * the choice depends on how much you hate Samsung.  If you absolutely hate everything Samsung, why did you buy a Samsung phone? you can flash it with CyanogenMod/stock/other favorite ROM of yours.  If you only hate some of their ideas — keyboard, launcher, samsung apps — you can just disable them/switch to something better.  In fact, I have this exact policy on my device: using Google Keyboard, Play Music, Gmail, and so on…"
CGPGrey,2bbh2d,grantben08,2,Tue Aug 19 08:09:27 2014 UTC,"not really.   you can use any launcher/keyboard/music player you want, and set it as the default. pirating apps by installing custom APKs requires enabling a publicly available setting.   There are plenty of “freedom” things you can do without rooting.  And what rooting changes is much different to what jailbreaks do to iPhones."
CGPGrey,2bbh2d,SHD_lotion,3,Tue Aug 19 08:15:24 2014 UTC,"The launcher is the application that provides the icons to tap. On iOS, it's an inextricable part of the operating system. On Android, it's just another app. So different launchers can act completely differently.  Some are just like stock, but with more customisation (Nova Launcher, Apex). Some are replicas of the interface on other devices, like the Windows Phone Metro/Modern interface. Others have novel features - EverythingMe has a ""prediction bar"" which shows different suggestions at different times of day."

You don't have to make use of the features, but buying a reasonably priced Nexus for example makes much more sense to the average consumer than buying an expensive Apple iPhone.

One might be better for you, but that does not apply to other people. You can of course tell them what makes X better than Y from your perspective. But most of the time, what you find important and good might be worthless for the next person.  Stuff like design and usability are highly subjective. I've read the usual stuff so far. Freedom, amount of apps, bla bla. Look. If someone made the decision for one OS, you should not heedlessly start to throw arguments at him. Ask why they use that OS and you will maybe see, that you can not convince him to change, no matter how hard you try.   Or you just accept that people like different stuff, beyond reasoning."

They have too much freedom, not enough freedom, ...  When you buy something physical, people will ask you why you made your decision, drop a few (semi-)helpful comments about quality or so and eventually drop the topic. With software, some people are just nuts. They do not accept that people have different preferences and needs and never stop arguing about which product is ""objectively"" better.

I like to listen to podcasts at higher than1x speed. With Downcast I could only listen at 1.25 speed because at 1.5x I couldn't discern enough of what was being said. With Smart Speed enabled I'm able to listen at 1.5x and I can hear everything being said. This tool allows the speed to fluctuate based on pauses and it makes a huge difference.  I also listen to podcast in the car. With any other podcast app I had to turn the volume was up to compete with the other noises, even if the car's EQ was set to speech. The Voice Boost feature makes a tremendous difference, allowing me to listen at lower volumes. I'm still on a trial run but so far it seems like it might be worth switching."

The US state flags violate all rules about flag design: you should be able to tell them apart when they're ON A FLAGPOLE.  If you line up the flags of the EU countries you can tell them all apart, even though there's themes: tricolours, nordic crosses, and so on.    All of the seal-on-blue-field ones are indistinguishable.  They also don't work as physical flags, since flags are typically through-printed and the reverse of the seal is obviously backwards unless you make the flag twice as thick.    The chat from Brady about ""the flags that are the most iconic are the ones I recognise""---that's because the ones that are terrible aren't used by anyone.  California, Ohio, Alabama, Arizona, and especially Texas have flags that are recognisable both as a little logo and as a living flag on a flagpole.

Their symbol, a red circle with groups of rays pointing in four directions, is painted on ceremonial vases, drawn on the ground around campfires, and used to introduce newborns to the Sun. Four is the sacred number of the Zia and can be found repeated in the four points radiating from the circle. The number four is embodied in:   the four points of the compass (north, south, east, and west); the four seasons of the year (spring, summer, autumn and winter); the four periods of each day (morning, noon, evening and night); the four seasons of life (childhood, youth, middle years and old age); and the four sacred obligations one must develop (a strong body, a clear mind, a pure spirit, and a devotion to the welfare of others), according to the Zia's belief.   The symbol is featured on the Flag of New Mexico and in the design of both the New Mexico State Capitol and New Mexico's State Quarter entry as well as the state highway marker. But given its history, the Pueblo would like people to first request permission before using it.

It didn't feel all that different than what Grey is describing.  I think you, Grey, are severely overestimating the importance of having Facebook and the Internet in a relationship that is primarily IRL, and underestimating how easy it is to lose touch with someone after you stop seeing them IRL, regardless of having Facebook.  Also, since everything on Facebook is in reverse-chronological order, it is pretty good at hiding your past-self, provided you input new content every once in a while.  I think that your worry is misplaced.  Also, on reunions: They're not there so you can meet up with the people you were friends with in high-school, they are there so you can see how those people have changed. I don't think you'll agree that this is right, but people are curious to see how their past friends turned out."

CGPGrey,2a5slw,autowikibot,2,Wed Jul 9 15:47:35 2014 UTC,"Fee simple:       In English law, a fee simple (or fee simple absolute) is an estate in land, a form of freehold ownership. It is the way that real estate is owned in common law countries, and is the highest ownership interest possible that can be had in real property. Allodial title is reserved to governments under a civil law structure. Fee simple ownership represents an ownership interest in real property, though it is limited by government powers of taxation, eminent domain, police power, and escheat, and it could also be limited further by certain encumbrances or conditions in the deed, such as, for example, a condition that required the land to be used as a public park, with a reversion interest in the grantor if the condition fail; this is a fee simple conditional.

CGPGrey,2a5slw,eye_patch_willy,7,Tue Jul 8 23:11:18 2014 UTC,The UN needs the US a lot more than the other way around. It does give smaller countries a forum on the international stage however. Useless is harsh but it's abilities are necessarily more limited than most would like.
CGPGrey,2a5slw,Stelith61,5,Wed Jul 9 02:09:02 2014 UTC,"In order to limit larger powers manipulating smaller ones, the United Nations has to let them do whatever they want without repercussions.   It's means circumvent it's purpose."

CGPGrey,2a5slw,Stelith61,3,Wed Jul 9 13:44:39 2014 UTC,"Exactly my point. For the UN to do anything, it has to let the US get around the rules. Therefore, the rules are pointless. If you give the people it was designed to limit allowance to get around the rule, why have the rule?"
CGPGrey,2a5slw,eye_patch_willy,1 point,Wed Jul 9 15:06:40 2014 UTC,"Goes back to my original point. The US doesn't need a body like the UN to have international influence. There is no reason for the US to even participate except the US sees it as beneficial to its foreign policy interests. Same goes for every other member nation. To keep big powers engaged in the process, those big powers must see it as worth the time and effort. So we have permanent members of the UNSC with tremendous power over the actions of the UN. If you took that away from the US, they would simply leave the UN, the UN would be even more toothless."

CGPGrey,2a5slw,Zagorath,2,Wed Jul 9 04:56:11 2014 UTC,True. It's just that only five are recognised as nuclear-weapon states under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Those are the five with veto power in the UNSC.
CGPGrey,2a5slw,yonghokim,3,Wed Jul 9 05:09:39 2014 UTC,A common misconception.. the five countries are there because they were the main winners of world war 2. In fact four of them.had no nukes in their early days in the UNSC.
CGPGrey,2a5slw,iknownuffink,2,Wed Jul 9 05:25:18 2014 UTC,"Very little of importance happens in the UN without approval from the security council. The other UN bodies can make all the declarations, laws, and rulings they like, but if anyone doesn't want to get with the program, it falls to the SC to enforce it.  Example: The UN has told the US that the US owes them money, took them to a UN court, got a ruling that said ""yes, America owes you this money"", served the US with that ruling, and America said ""No, we don't.""   Then when it went to the SC for enforcement, and surprise surprise, the US vetoed any action that would make them pay it."
CGPGrey,2a5slw,Jimbo762au,3,Wed Jul 9 06:53:10 2014 UTC,The UN is a toothless tiger. They rely on countries like the US to be the implements of their policy. They arn't going near the US.

There are several countries that WOULDN'T EXIST if there weren't US bases there to defend them and act as a deterrent.  Anti-Americanism is a mental disorder, an especially funny one when it comes from countries who are dependent on the US. They gotta cope with their inferiority complex somehow.﻿   That has to take the cake when it comes to completely unreasonable things to say in response to a wonderfully informative video.

In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. However, it retains formal sovereignty, and remains a state under international law. A territory subject to this type of arrangement is also known as a protected state.

CGPGrey,29qrly,Zartonk,54,Thu Jul 3 14:55:52 2014 UTC,"No, given the amount of information that was available to him Grey could not have made the decision to add the military bases. Emotions are for the weak. beep boop"

CGPGrey,29qrly,ainrialai,11,Thu Jul 3 15:28:16 2014 UTC,Cuba is still sovereign over Guantanamo Bay.  We have a 100+ year old treaty that says we can have a base there.  Cuba wants to void the treaty and we won't let them.  But we still recognize that it is all their land.
CGPGrey,29qrly,Nolemretaw,17,Thu Jul 3 15:42:57 2014 UTC,"Cuba wants to ""void"" a treaty which was basically signed under duress. The United States is also in violation of the lease, since the bounds of the lease were set ""generally to do any and all things necessary to fit the premises for use as coaling or naval stations only, and for no other purpose."" The prison camp being run by the United States in the area of the lease is not necessary for the maintenance of a coaling or naval station, so the United States has voided the lease and Cuba has every right to throw them out. Especially since the base houses a military that has directly attacked the island and its people."
CGPGrey,29qrly,Zarorg,3,Thu Jul 3 17:42:24 2014 UTC,"we, IIRC, and with out spending the 2 seconds to run a query through Google, we, being the United States pay rent on Guantanamo."
CGPGrey,29qrly,EnhancementShaman,10,Thu Jul 3 16:18:52 2014 UTC,"The United States sends checks to the Cuban government, but the Cubans don't cash them, maintaining that the occupation is illegal."
CGPGrey,29qrly,gavers,4,Thu Jul 3 17:50:25 2014 UTC,so we are basically the world's largest squatter?  more or less
CGPGrey,29qrly,BlueRavenGT,7,Thu Jul 3 18:22:30 2014 UTC,"I don't think so. Northern Cyprus is being squatted by Turkey, and Crimea by Russia. I can't think of any larger ones."
CGPGrey,29qrly,gavers,2,Thu Jul 3 22:15:43 2014 UTC,"they cashed one once.  cuba says it was an accident, usa says takes it as cubas acceptance of the lease"
CGPGrey,29qrly,BlueRavenGT,3,Fri Jul 4 11:15:03 2014 UTC,When did you mention military bases? I can't seem to find that part of the video.
CGPGrey,29qrly,gavers,2,Thu Jul 3 18:59:18 2014 UTC,5:50
CGPGrey,29qrly,BlueRavenGT,3,Thu Jul 3 23:08:02 2014 UTC,"The deal is that the US provides economic support and military defence to the compact nations, in return for being allowed to build military bases there.   That doesn't talk about the designation of all or any US military bases abroad. Nor does it talk about the citizenship of people on said bases."
CGPGrey,29qrly,argash,2,Thu Jul 3 23:28:29 2014 UTC,"It's one place he mentioned military bases. He may have mentioned them somewhere else, but I didn't notice if he did."
CGPGrey,29qrly,Kronf,2,Thu Jul 3 23:34:29 2014 UTC,"It seems he didn't, but then what was Grey talking about when he said ""Oh crap. Just realized I didn't put in the ‡ when I mentioned military bases. Pretend it's there, people."""
CGPGrey,29qrly,argash,2,Thu Jul 3 23:37:14 2014 UTC,Maybe it has to do with the technicalities of building bases in the compact nations and the post about Guantanamo Bay just reminded him that he forgot.
CGPGrey,29qrly,MyEarly90sScreenName,2,Thu Jul 3 23:56:26 2014 UTC,You should do a followup that discusses all the countries the US has military bases in and how large their presence is in each.
CGPGrey,29qrly,Turtle700,3,Thu Jul 3 16:06:10 2014 UTC,Extremely interesting! But I'm afraid CGP might rather avoid this topic as being too political.

CGPGrey,29qrly,Shuff264,3,Thu Jul 3 16:48:32 2014 UTC,Well it's more Nova like than Maryland like. Plus a lot of people who work in government live in nova.
CGPGrey,29qrly,Shuff264,12,Thu Jul 3 18:50:11 2014 UTC,"But wasn't that kind of the point to begin with, making a parliamentary district that is separate from state politics?"
CGPGrey,29qrly,Shuff264,2,Thu Jul 3 19:34:38 2014 UTC,"It was separated so no one state got the advantage of having the national capital (and resulting business, tourist, etc.) in it. That doesn't really matter as much today, still relevant, but just not as much."
CGPGrey,29qrly,gavers,2,Thu Jul 3 23:01:53 2014 UTC,Taxation without representation.
CGPGrey,29qrly,gavers,92,Thu Jul 3 18:50:37 2014 UTC,How about this for a 51 state flag?
CGPGrey,29qrly,Kwpolska,50,Thu Jul 3 15:13:28 2014 UTC,I think that one is interesting.  Didn't want to show it in this video as I'm saving it for something else.

CGPGrey,29qrly,MissRainbowtie,10,Thu Jul 3 15:32:22 2014 UTC,I think a potential problem with this is that it puts a star (state) in the centre of the others. Making it seem more important.
CGPGrey,29qrly,Soturi27,29,Thu Jul 3 16:14:48 2014 UTC,This is such a silly seeming complaint that Im 100 precent sure that it would be brought up. The only real question is will we just be able to ignore it?
CGPGrey,29qrly,CSMastermind,18,Thu Jul 3 17:33:10 2014 UTC,Everyone can just pretend it's their state.
CGPGrey,29qrly,Soturi27,10,Thu Jul 3 22:17:19 2014 UTC,Last time I saw that flag posted on reddit someone suggested that the star in the center could always be the state where the flag is flown in. Now how to do it when it's flown outside of the U.S. I don't know :)
CGPGrey,29qrly,gavers,5,Thu Jul 3 18:08:11 2014 UTC,"How the hell can anyone know which state that is? I could point at it and say, that's NJ (whooo), but there's no way to validate that, is there?"
CGPGrey,29qrly,gavers,4,Fri Jul 4 00:58:28 2014 UTC,its definitely NJ.

CGPGrey,29qrly,thebhgg,6,Thu Jul 3 18:37:53 2014 UTC,I love the symbolic pentagon hanging out in the background around the central star...

CGPGrey,29qrly,quirt,61,Sat Jul 5 15:21:27 2014 UTC,"If a person is born anywhere within this American Empire, are they allowed to run for President? Or is that restricted to the 50 official states only?   Edit: wording"
CGPGrey,29qrly,zoidboix,53,Thu Jul 3 14:58:26 2014 UTC,I think so. John McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone when it was owned by the United States.
CGPGrey,29qrly,gavers,60,Thu Jul 3 15:59:42 2014 UTC,He was born to an American military officer so he was a citizen.  It wouldn't have mattered it he was born in Russia.
CGPGrey,29qrly,Socks404,25,Thu Jul 3 18:49:23 2014 UTC,"So I looked it up because I'd never heard of this before.   The law that fills in the gaps of the vague constitutional statement of ""Natural Born Citizen""  http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title8/html/USCODE-2011-title8-chap12-subchapIII-partI-sec1401.htm  The relevant bits, The following shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth:  (c) a person born outside of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents both of whom are citizens of the United States and one of whom has had a residence in the United States or one of its outlying possessions, prior to the birth of such person;  (e) a person born in an outlying possession of the United States of parents one of whom is a citizen of the United States who has been physically present in the United States or one of its outlying possessions for a continuous period of one year at any time prior to the birth of such person;  Long story short , if you're born to an American abroad (mother or father or both), you're an American citizen. Additionally American possessions are kind of treated like foreign countries, one parent has to be a citizen for the child to be one. So if your mother emigrated from Germany to Puerto Rico and had you there you couldn't run for President, but you could if she emigrated to Michigan.  Man I was bored at work today, looking up citizenship laws."
CGPGrey,29qrly,gavers,3,Thu Jul 3 20:03:43 2014 UTC,"I was doing that earlier today by chance too. My SO is Canadian and I am American, but we both live in Israel and hold dual citizenships (Israeli and respective country). We were trying to figure out what would happen if we were to marry and wanted to live and work for a period of time in one of our former countries.  It's very confusing. Does my SO need a green card to live and work in the US? Can/will she get US citizenship and therefore have triple-citizenship? What about me and Canada?  So confusing."
CGPGrey,29qrly,BooKoala,18,Thu Jul 3 20:45:11 2014 UTC,"And no one finds it funny that people were questioning Obama's citizenship and place of birth, but not McCain's? One was born in a state while the other was born in a temporary territory..."
CGPGrey,29qrly,TheWetWestCoast,14,Thu Jul 3 18:54:48 2014 UTC,"No, one was born on an American enclave in a foreign country, while the other was born in Islamic Kenya!!"
CGPGrey,29qrly,BooKoala,19,Thu Jul 3 19:08:44 2014 UTC,"...to a US-citizen mother.    In the whole ""Obama is not eligible"" debate, I never once saw this fact raised (or disputed).  So even if the Kenya story were true (and it is not) the enraging thing is, it still doesn't matter."
CGPGrey,29qrly,TheWetWestCoast,12,Thu Jul 3 19:25:12 2014 UTC,"I sure hope /u/zoidboix joking. But lets humor his/her comment just in case:  Kenya (or ""the Republic of Kenya""), isn't an ""Islamic state"" by any means, let alone officially.    ""Kenyans are Christian (83%), with 47.7% regarding themselves as Protestant and 23.5% as Roman Catholic of the Latin Rite."" (from Wikipedia)   Ignoring all that, when Obama was born (August 4, 1961) Kenya wasn't an independent country, it was still the ""Colony and Protectorate of Kenya"" which was part of British Empire. It only gained independence from the United Kingdom on the 12th of December 1963 and declared republic a year later in 1964.  So, assuming that Obama was born in Kenya (which he wasn't), he wasn't born in a Islamic Kenya (which doesn't and didn't exist)."
CGPGrey,29qrly,thebhgg,8,Thu Jul 3 20:40:20 2014 UTC,"So, assuming that Obama was born in Kenya (which he wasn't), he wasn't born in a Islamic Kenya (which doesn't and didn't exist).   It would be too much to expect most Americans (especially conservatives grasping for any reason to hate Obama) to acknowledge these subtleties. The main reason for thinking Obama is Muslim is his middle name (Hussein), which everyone of course associates with Saddam Hussein. Ironically, Obama's father had converted to Anglicanism as a child, so it's not like either parent was Muslim."
CGPGrey,29qrly,Thremtopod,6,Fri Jul 4 13:13:48 2014 UTC,"Well, I was being sarcastic and mocking birther folks, so I totally agree with what you said."

CGPGrey,29qrly,jhuang29,3,Thu Jul 3 20:41:22 2014 UTC,"Not that I believe any of that junk, but I believe the concern wasn't really whether being born in Hawaii would qualify but whether he was actually born in Hawaii.  The whole thing is so silly anyway. Can you imagine how it would affect the citizenry's confidence in the system, if someone who won with that large of a margin were taken out of office because someone doubts the validity of his birth certificate?"
CGPGrey,29qrly,DCPatentAtty,2,Thu Jul 3 22:36:44 2014 UTC,See this thread for my responce.
CGPGrey,29qrly,CHAAWCOLATE,29,Thu Jul 3 22:55:32 2014 UTC,"That is a conversation that bubbles up from time to time in the political media. I believe the constitutional requirements are that someone is a 'natural-born citizen' (I believe that is the phrase). Conveniently, it doesn't go into further detail.   The stories around this over the last few years have been: - Ted Cruz born in Canada to an American mother and Cuban father - John McCain born on an American military base in Panama - President Obama born in Hawaii to an American mother before Hawaii was officially a full state for the 5 years required by some other piece of law (I am not sure I am remembering that one correctly).  - Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal aren't natural-born because their parents weren't citizens at the time of their births.   In some ways, the fact that these ""scandals"" (to use that term loosely) are even addressed in the media is a sad reflection on the state of politics, and nationalism in the US at the moment."
CGPGrey,29qrly,Darth_Hobbes,28,Thu Jul 3 16:02:00 2014 UTC,'natural-born citizen'   So those born by caesarean sections cannot run for office? :P

CGPGrey,29qrly,Darth_Hobbes,3,Thu Jul 3 17:33:57 2014 UTC,I want you to cut it out!
CGPGrey,29qrly,Darth_Hobbes,4,Thu Jul 3 19:25:53 2014 UTC,"I think these need to be reported on by the media. If someone is elected president and it later turns out that they don't qualify by the terms set in the constitution, the opposing political party could (and definitely would) bring the matter to the supreme court, whose job it is to uphold the constitution. Whether or not the criteria should be amended is a different discussion, but I think it's far preferable to have stupid news stories than an actually serious scandal of the potential supreme court case."
CGPGrey,29qrly,CHAAWCOLATE,2,Thu Jul 3 17:00:28 2014 UTC,"My concern with these stories is (a) how they are presented in the media; and (b) why is this anachronism of the law getting attention now. Is it simply a question of demographics, or something more sinister lurking underneath.   I am more concerned with why have these stories left a jingoistic feeling behind, rather than a clear debate or discussion of why the term was included in the constitution, and whether that restriction on the presidency still valuable.  I deeply believe in only having laws, or restrictions that are valuable and necessary, and I do not think that meets either of those."
CGPGrey,29qrly,jake2500,3,Thu Jul 3 17:26:30 2014 UTC,"The birthplace accusations are merely an excuse for people to dismiss the President or presidential candidate. These people already hate the guy, and now they have a simple way to get rid of him. I'm sure there some racism and nationalism involved, though."
CGPGrey,29qrly,jeaguilar,2,Thu Jul 3 20:59:40 2014 UTC,I wouldn't call these scandals. They are usually brought up by people desperate to disqualify an opposing party's candidate. These objections invariably come from the fringe elements of either party.

Quick note, too: we actually do get some voting power in the Presidential election now thanks to the 23rd Amendment in 1961, but conversely, did not even get the right to form a local government (mayor, council, etc) until the Home Rule Act of 1973.

CGPGrey,292ib4,cjp_,2,Thu Jun 26 15:48:16 2014 UTC,"I've just got done reading this article;  it's good to see someone shares a similar point of view.  About 4 years ago, I began walking down a road, just about every day.  I began doing this because I wasn't sure who I was, or who I wanted to be anymore.  My grandmother had just died; unrelated, I had decided that I was done with my ex girlfriends bad habits, she was long distance and had grown away from me as her dependencies grew.  So one day, I ""disappeared"".  Not in the sense of losing contact with absolutely everyone, but I was done with my online life, and I was already dead to most of my friends.  Having no job, I decided to begin to improve myself.  I initially chose the road that I walk because it was right outside my door and barely anyone else walked it.  I also believe a part of me wanted to walk it because it was dangerous.  Many semi trucks going at a decent rate of speed.  Looking back on it, the danger was meant to be a trial of courage to my new self.  I'm glad I did it, as my friends and I hang out regularly, I have a job, and I have lost well over 100 pounds.  I also get to listen to this awesome podcast nowadays, but I'm all out of them, so I've begun doing audiobooks instead.  I didn't just die to my old self; I killed the old self.  I have to say that I'm pretty happy with the results."

Anyone who's considered an ""expert"" in any field feels like they're just getting started. You reach a certain point in developing any set of skills where you realize that no matter how hard you work, you will never be done. And that's OK.   I'm a programmer. I make video games. I recognize that I will never master programming. There will always be more to learn, something that I haven't thought of, something that changes the way I go about solving problems. Failure to acknowledge this means that you'll simply become stuck in your ways and left behind as the rest of the world continues learning."

CGPGrey,292ib4,NathanGath,2,Thu Jun 26 15:38:00 2014 UTC,"So we start looking for evidence to test Levitin’s (and others’) statements about 10,000 hours being both necessary and sufficient. We do this by disproving it, and begin with chess. Gobet and Campitelli studied 104 chess players and measured practice time and performance level, and looked at the time taken to reach the Master level. This is their finding:  So, the average time taken is 11,053 hours. That’s pretty much in agreement with Ericsson’s violin players. So far so good. But look at that Standard Deviation – 5,538 hours, and it gives a co-efficient of variation of 50%. For those not into the statistics, what this basically shows is a “spread” of the values around the average. If the Standard Deviation is small, and the CV is low, then you have a tight cluster – all the individuals are close to the average. But when it’s 50%, then you know you have massive differences within that group.  And that’s what happens when you start looking at individuals – one player reaches master level on 3,000 hours, another takes almost 24,000 hours, and some are still practicing but not succeeding. That’s a 21,000 hour difference, which is two entire practice lifetimes according to the model of practice. It seems pretty clear that practice, while important, is not sufficient for some. And for others, it’s not even necessary.  But let’s look at other sports. Darts has been studied, by Duffy and Ericsson. They find the following when looking at darts scores and accumulated practice time:  The figure above shows how much of performance can be explained by deliberate practice. In chess, which I showed above, it’s 34%. In darts, 15 years of practice explains only 28% of the variation in performance between individuals! An extra-ordinary finding, because with all due respect, that’s in darts…what else is there that influences performance? Yet practice time accounts for only a quarter of the performance differences.  What is most interesting about this is that 10 years of practice explained 25% of variability, while 15 years explains 28%. So clearly, the more you practice, the more you can explain performance. That’s not surprising, but the question is this: How many hours of practice would it take to explain “most” of performance as a result of practice? Look at the quote in the figure above, where Ericsson writes that “the development of expert performance will be primarily constrained by individuals’ engagement in deliberate practice” (Ericsson, 2009). Well, 28% is not “primarily constrained” and even though more practice explains more of performance, there is clearly a lot missing from this practice argument.  http://www.sportsscientists.com/2011/08/talent-training-and-performance-the-secrets-of-success/"

After the novelty wears off, all I feel they'll become is a reminder of who I used to be. And at every stage of my life thus far, I am happier with my ""present"" self than myself of five years past. Why would I want a label picked out by an inferior person stuck on body forever?    I came to this realization when I was in university and met someone with a Wu-Tang Clan ""W"" tattoo on his hand and asked him if he was a big Wu-Tang fan. His response?

I was considering getting a tattoo that would remind me to always do my best and never give up on life, and something with that kind of reminder-meaning should keep fairly well, even if the design is bad. And hey, if the design is bad, it's still a reminder that you were once worse and you are now better, and to keep going.  If I ever decide on a tattoo design that I want, I've decided that I'll roll it around in my mind for a year (or some other arbitrary time period) before actually getting it. If it's still a good idea, it probably will be for quite awhile yet.  There's also the fact that we continue to accumulate other marks, based on the choices we make or not. If you choose to get in a dumb fight and get a scar, that's also permanently on your body (well, as permanent as a tattoo is). What it means to you afterward can be either ""I was dumb when I was $n years old"" or ""Wow, I need to remember to not get into any more dumb fights"" or even ""I'm glad I'm smarter than $n year old me, now."" It's up for interpretation.  That all being said, don't get tattoos with text on them, or ones that reference another person or group of people.

As you get older, your sense of time slows, so the proportion probably isn't as bad after scaling, but then a second feels half as long as it used to 5 years ago (I do keep track of this) and I feel my death happening faster. I'd really like some hard numbers on how fast this happens.  While it's dearly important to me that I keep some promises to my younger selves, I'm not going out of my way to stay the same person. I've actually become friends with someone I used to know, and at the start we both recognized that we had more in common with each other than our previous selves. I want this to become the common understanding.  Also, there should be a verb for the Ship of Theseus concept."

So rapid but complete phineas gage style changes could be as short as 6 months, but more subtle changes may not have the radical impact and take as long as two years. I also think that 10 years feels about right to almost be a completely new human(sharing very little in common with your past self) where as a significant change that doesn't affect other aspects of your ""known"" personality feels less significant when looking at each individual iteration despite adding up to be that completely new person."

Mostly I suspect that people immediately construct a strawman to argue against when they hear this particular combination of words.  I repeat: Of course you can't delete all copies of a piece of information that has been posted online. But that is irrelevant.  The ""right to be forgotten"" ruling is about the strength of feedback mechanisms in a complex dynamical system, namely the information flow in human interaction over the internet.  What the ruling does is to give you the possibility to   Have your data deleted from the big information aggregators Have the data about you that isn't stored in one of the places where you can have it deleted instead be de-listed by the big metadata aggregators, such as search engines.   Sure, many things will have legitimate or illegitimate copies remaining online, but those will be harder to find, which slows down the dynamical feedback loop that makes the info keep bubbling up to the surface.  I did my PhD in complex dynamic systems. This is the way to make something fade into oblivion if it can't be truly purged. Sure, somebody who really wants to find the sins of your youth can still do so for a long time. But as time goes by, fewer people will know what to look for, and still fewer will find something."

The neural connections in a brain are not replaced when we get new information, we form new connections. We pile on more and more connections and update that logic tree we call a brain, the decisions we make, and the ""person"" we identify ourselves as, changes. Your 10 year and 20 year former selves are still up there somewhere.  I wish I could disassociate myself from some screwed up parts of my childhood. No amount of self-awareness or growth will change that I am still affected by things that happened twenty years ago.   Also, is the Internets memory any worse than a tattoo?

CGPGrey,27t6sj,1000wordpics,23,Wed Jun 11 05:56:58 2014 UTC,"Yep.  The world is full of terrible password security schemes, and the utter garbage that gets passed around as ""best practices"" is a sure way to lock people into writing passwords on post-its and putting them under their keyboards:  Changing passwords every 30 days.  Inability to re-use passwords.  Minimum lengths.  Maximum lengths.  This one's really frustrating because using a pass phrase is often much easier to remember, but the same people that expect you to change a password every 30 days often limit you to 12 characters.  ""That one day I hugged a giraffe."" is a much better password than ""zaq1!xsw2@"" (look at it on your keyboard if you don't intuitively get the point.  I keep passwords in a book that I normally keep nowhere near my computer, looks nothing like a notebook (and, in fact, isn't), and are written down according to a simple cypher and transformation that I can un-do without any real mental effort.  I almost never have to use this except for important passwords that I only need once or twice a year."
CGPGrey,27t6sj,Delusionn,13,Wed Jun 11 07:46:14 2014 UTC,"The point of using a simple cipher to encode your handwritten passwords is an important one since even if someone gets a hold of it, it isn't even necessarily obvious that it's ciphertext and hence only really useful if actually stolen and fiddled with.  The point about long passwords is not so much when the root of having that length available is to use several words in a phrase. Despite being many words and being long, people don't recognize that these are still easily broken by a dictionary attack. You often hear quoted that xkcd comic about using phrases like correcthorsebatterystaple, but this is exceedingly poor advice as these are the most common types of passwords broken. And letter substitutions such as S=5=$? Abysmal. You aren't trying to fool a computer here, you're trying to fool other humans that are very likely to be more clever than you are and have the ability to try clever things blisteringly quickly.  One decent measure of blocking dictionary attacks is putting random characters in the middle of your words, so they are not verbatim the indexed words, or permuting letters in a way that destroys the original words yet isn't a predictable permutation. Another is using the Schneier scheme, where a significantly longer, personally memorable (but not common) phrase or sentence is abbreviated in such a way that it becomes unidentifiable.  But of course, if you CAN remember essentially random alphanumeric strings, then that is still the best as long as it exceeds (for now) 10 characters. Anything with nine characters or less should not be considered secure from brute force at this moment."

CGPGrey,27t6sj,Wouter10123,15,Wed Jun 11 07:13:01 2014 UTC,"Near the end of the podcast, grey quotes Shakespeare writing as Juliet saying ""a rose by any other name would be just as sweet"" and it's funny that grey of all people would quote it. I mean first of all, the quote, in it's original use, was meant to be contradicted. Juliet says this because she's a product of youth and nativity, and ultimately it is her name, Capulet, that ends her life.  I also find it funny that grey would use this quote because grey acknowledges the power of names. From near the beginning of the podcast up until now, grey and Brady have been trying to come up with names for ideas like freebooting/viewjacking or net neutrality/data discrimination, because they understand that words in themselves have power. They understand that net neutrality is boring and doesn't carry the weight that a phrase like data discrimination does. But to bring this all back to the context of grey's argument that last names don't matter, when in fact it really does. Last names like Rockefeller or Ford, carry lots of power. Perhaps those names won't in the scope of hundreds of generations, but having those last names still has value. Also last names denote ethnic and racial identities. Last names like Wong come with cultural and racial substance. It shows acceptance into a group that is by defined by blood ties and relations. Furthermore, names in general can prove potent. There's a well known study showing that people with identifiably ethnically African American names have a much harder time getting jobs in America, accounting for other factors like age, gender, experience, and education."

I do this for the same reason - I never have to think about how I'm going to capitalize a track or artist name, or include the ""the"" in group that sometimes uses one and sometimes doesn't.  Originally, there was a better reason to use lowercase tagging - limited real estate on pixel based displays (the Creative MP3 player I had, the iPods I had after, car stereos, etc.).

CGPGrey,27t6sj,bunabhucan,18,Tue Jun 10 21:53:58 2014 UTC,"For some reason, this feels to me like it completely discounts the contribution women add to your family tree if they change their name. IF the ENTIRE family tree somehow came to an end(not just your branch), that seems worthy of sorrow, but the actual last name ending seems irrelevant given how unjust towards women the system is."
CGPGrey,27t6sj,rlbond86,8,Tue Jun 10 21:55:07 2014 UTC,"Yeh, this was kind of what I was thinking through the whole segment. Like, if The Name is that important, then why not encourage your daughters to keep/hyphenate their names, etc. If that's an unacceptable tack for reasons of Tradition, then it's not just The Name that's important, it's The Name (and our patrilineal naming system that erases female ancestors). There are ways to preserve a surname if you're willing to bend tradition, and you can preserve tradition if you're willing to accept the loss of surnames as a necessary consequence; pick one."
CGPGrey,27t6sj,nipedo,5,Wed Jun 11 00:28:06 2014 UTC,"My grandmother, who had an incredibly rare last name, actually got one of her sons, my uncle, to take her last name. He subsequently had a son. Thus so far, her rare family name continues to be passed on. But this is in general a rare case.  Quite honestly, as a female, it's so hard for me to care about the passing on of the family name. I mean, as a society, I'm expected to change my last name once I get married anyway (obviously it's not mandatory, but it is certainly the norm). So if someone places such importance on how last name is deeply associated with legacy, tradition, blah blah blah...I wonder how people feel about the fact that along the same logic - women are, in essence, expected to ""give up"" their family legacy and tradition upon marriage."
CGPGrey,27t6sj,philosophizingsquid,3,Thu Jun 12 15:00:28 2014 UTC,"I totally agree!  I understand that people are attached to their name, but the conversation completely ignored the fact that we (generally in english speaking countries) expect women to forgo that same priveledge."
CGPGrey,27t6sj,MatheNick,5,Thu Jun 12 23:16:32 2014 UTC,"This is what I felt like Grey and Brady were both dancing around, maybe unconsciously -- Grey kept saying there was no reason it should matter, but it seems like everyone knew exactly why it mattered: male dominance in the family. But as soon as you say it out loud it's obvious that it's indefensible. I think people avoid even thinking it, which is why that prior commenter could only say it's sad, not why -- why Grey couldn't really articulate why it shouldn't matter. Because saying it out loud means you're admitting that what you're talking about is peoples' commitment to misogyny.   Brady kept saying that the symbolism is important, but they were failing to address that what makes symbols matter is scaring about the thing they're a symbol for. The fact that men's names survive -- the fact that one of the first things men's children tell strangers about themselves is the label of their male line of descent -- is a symbol of a history of male dominance, and of thousands of years of misogynistic culture."

Butcher's original proposed title for the first novel was Semiautomagic, which sums up the series' balance of fantasy and hard-boiled detective fiction.   As of 2014, Butcher has written 15 novels, plus a number of short stories (some of which are collated in the anthology Side Jobs). The series has also been released in audiobook format, with all but one audiobook read by James Marsters. Other works set in the same fictional universe include graphic novels (two new stories, plus adaptations of the first two novels), and The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game. In 2007, a television series based on the novels aired for one season on the American Sci-Fi Channel.

CGPGrey,27t6sj,H4Kek,5,Wed Jun 11 10:09:25 2014 UTC,This podcast helped me stay awake through the long first night in the hospital with my first baby. Thanks for making it a long one Grey!

CGPGrey,27a9yn,MindOfMetalAndWheels,221,Wed Jun 4 12:10:36 2014 UTC,Surely 'in law' is a suffix not a prefix?

CGPGrey,27a9yn,amphicoelias,7,Wed Jun 4 13:37:12 2014 UTC,Why? As a native dutch speaker i think it's a boring language (as everyone thinks about their native language).
CGPGrey,27a9yn,iramo94,32,Wed Jun 4 14:45:00 2014 UTC,"From an English/Spanish speaker's perspective: All of your words sound wonderfully silly and goofy.  It's like German, if Germans had a sense of humor.  It's also close enough to english that I can see some of the roots, but far enough away that it sounds more like music than language."
CGPGrey,27a9yn,amphicoelias,7,Wed Jun 4 20:53:28 2014 UTC,"I've had germans say this too, that our language sounds ""goofy"" or ""funny"". As a native speaker i of course can't hear that. Does it really make you giggle or is it just slightly silly?"
CGPGrey,27a9yn,iramo94,12,Wed Jun 4 21:37:42 2014 UTC,"It's not laugh-out-loud funny, but it definitely conjures up images of someone living in a windmill, surrounded by tulips, which is entertaining."

CGPGrey,27a9yn,maxkoenig,6,Thu Jun 5 02:19:13 2014 UTC,"As is the German equivalent Schwieger- (Schwiegermutter) and we also have ""Schwager"" instead of brother-in-law"

Also, are you aware that Wolfram Alpha computes relations? You can type in ""grandparent's sibling's child's first cousin's nephew"" and get an answer for what you are to them. I've found it convenient. Inadvertently while creating this random relation, I've come up with a chain that can lead to oneself. Otherwise, it's just a second cousin."

But I agree the video seemed different than the others I have watched beforehand. I think it was because it was a fairly straightforward video and didn't have a lot of bigger implications like a lot of his videos that I have seen are a part of a larger conversation. This one felt like 'just the facts ma'am'.

CGPGrey,27a9yn,narbris,4,Fri Jun 6 12:43:41 2014 UTC,This sounds weird to me. To which cultures is this distinction observed?
CGPGrey,27a9yn,amphicoelias,53,Fri Jun 6 19:16:28 2014 UTC,"Edit: My family tree! If you wrap this around a cylinder and you will have my family tree in 3 dimensions. However, i would need a torus to display my family tree if I traced it back a couple more generations.  I probably shouldn't, but I’m going to try to explain my family tree and how it can't be drawn in 2 dimensions. Warning it's going to get weird.  About 30 years ago my mother's mother and my father's father got married, effectively making them (my parents) step siblings. That's just the beginning. This would effectively make my mother my step aunt and my father my step uncle in addition to being my parent and my siblings are my step cousins.  Confused? It gets worse.  Around the same time my grandparents were remarrying (and also becoming my step grandparents?) they had a son who is just barely older than me. So their son is my mom's half sibling making him my half uncle, but he is also my father's half sibling making him my...half uncle again. So does that make him my double half uncle? and which side of the family tree do I put him on? My grandparents also adopted another son who is my biological first cousin, but my legal uncle/double half uncle.  Let's delve even deeper. My great grand uncle on one side of the family married my grand aunt on the opposite side of the family. So each of my second cousins from them are also my third cousins from the opposite side. So let's put all this to together.   I have second cousins on this side of the family (these sides of the family?) that are also my third cousins, and through my mother are also my step second cousins, and also my step third cousins.  That's right second cousins/step second cousins/third cousins/step third cousins.  Disclaimer: There are no marriages of blood relation in my family"

CGPGrey,27a9yn,narbris,12,Wed Jun 4 14:48:27 2014 UTC,That's where we run into the 2D problem. There are multiple family members that are on both sides of my family tree. I should make a cylinder shaped family tree.  So everything can fully wrap around. Maybe even a donut. This makes a lot more sense if you have ever heard of the unsolvable utilities problem...
CGPGrey,27a9yn,NAG3LT,10,Wed Jun 4 14:56:59 2014 UTC,In that case we're going to need a set of 3D coordinates.

CGPGrey,27a9yn,taylikes,6,Wed Jun 4 18:16:37 2014 UTC,"Yes, this is similar to my family tree I am trying to print something off that I can wrap around a cylinder. If I get a chance I will upload the results. I would do it now, but I have to go teach lazy summer school students."

Even a few hundred years ago my ancestors probably pronounced my name differently and they would accuse me of butchering it. It's not about the mouth sounds. It about understanding your past and your heritage. I take a lot of pride in who my fore-bearers were and the things they accomplished. I like that I have that name attached to my identity.

A woman's husband and brother are ""szwagier"" to each other. And your spouse's sister is also always simply ""szwagierka"".  My brother's son and daughter would be my ""bratanek"" and ""bratanica"", respectively, but my sister's children would be ""siostrzeniec"" and ""siostrzenica"".  There also used to be proper mess with the way you call your father's or mother's brother or sister (so, four separate words, a different one for each of those) and some extra words for their respective spouses (so aunts and uncles you're not genetically related to), but it's been phased out and every aunt and uncle are now called ""ciocia"" and ""wujek"", respectively.

CGPGrey,26p3e1,NonObservantObserver,20,Wed May 28 19:23:17 2014 UTC,"It seems to be groupings of 8-bit bytes.  It is arranged in a grid: 7*7-1, so 48 bytes.  There are 43 unique bytes, and none are duplicated more than once.  Values range from 7 to 254 (assuming unsigned) with the most significant clusters from 22-40 and 160-186.  There are duplicates, but not very many - not enough for it to be a simple cryptogram.  It's possible, but unlikely, for it to be simply encoded in something other than ascii.  It would need to include capitals and/or a bunch of symbols.  Based on experimentation, the number of duplicates is consistent with random data, with 5 duplicates being the most common result.  Neither zcat nor bzcat accept it as valid data.  That doesn't mean that it isn't compressed data, those were just the two most likely candidates (and the easiest to check).  gzip compresses it to 71 bytes, which is consistent with random noise (not a very good measure of entropy, but a handy one).  I think this is either random, or compressed.  I'm looking forward to what other's have to say."

Also a problem with the fight scenes (lets ignore the realistic part) is that there is no threat of danger to the party and the majority of the battles focuses around the party. We know Bilbo won't die, Gandalf won't die until much later, and if you know some details about The Hobbit book, you know who lives/dies.

They only announced the transition to three films publicly very late in the game - summer '12 - with the first one coming out only a few months later. They've discussed that the barrel scene in the second film would have been the breakpoint between the two original films, which helps explain how epic-y it feels. It would have been the big climax of the movie. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(film_series)#From_two_to_three_films  Having enjoyed the LotR ones tremendously, I didn't expect a similar experience from this batch. I view them as an extra dollop, dessert on top of an already-satisfying meal. I will enjoy the parts that work well and not worry too much about the parts that don't. For the most part I am willing to go along with some of the wonkier changes and just chuckle in mild bemusement at the very strangest additions (rock giants, kili/tauriel).  In general I like the often sillier tone. I like the dwarves-as-refugees and bilbo's speech about why he's helping them. I feel like the moments that were very important to get right were done well - bilbo/gollum, bilbo/smaug. I like that they brought a lot of the material from the appendices into these films and didn't solely use the Hobbit's text. I view it pragmatically that it's unlikely that that material would have been enough for a movie by itself and that it's equally unlikely that there will be more Tolkien movies after the Hobbit (and certain actors would have aged out of certain roles far more than the very slight amount they have already).  Did you catch Stephen Colbert's cameo? (hint: it's in laketown) :-)"

There is a CGP Grey video on time management for teachers, and he has done a blog post listing apps he uses.  Ever since Grey mentioned strategically skipping homework and how that does not build a great work ethic (at 27:00) I've felt something of a kinship in our independently developed laziness. I've long hoped for a whole episode on productivity, but even just a segment on checklists is welcome."
CGPGrey,25gfe5,Stranjak,57,Wed May 14 01:16:08 2014 UTC,"I don't watch either of your videos, I came across the podcast in iTunes and haven't explored your channels partly because of busyness and partly because I'm not into math/numbers, so I wasn't particularly motivated to seek them out - I love the podcast though, I'm checking you both out on youtube right after posting this. Also - I stumbled across the RLM Star Wars about a year ago and love them."

How come there are such differences in how an element is called? And why did some languages stick to the latin name and others, that are more closely related to latin, like italian have the newer name (potassio) for instance? Is there any chance this topic could end up being a periodic video?  [Edit: Oh and it goes the other way round of course: Nitrogen being called Stickstoff. The inconsistancy is rather annoying]"

CGPGrey,25gfe5,lalaland4711,7,Fri May 16 08:52:22 2014 UTC,"It bugs me that /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels hates the end of Avatar.  Don’t get me wrong, the film is not exactly on my top ten list, but the ending is not that bad.  Let’s ignore that technological superiority is not a guarantee of military success.  Let’s focus on why the Humans were sent back on a spaceship to go to Earth.   Here are my assumptions:   That the Na’vi know full well that the humans will be back. That the humans will be back. That interspatial communication is as slow as travel (the film never addresses communication delay, but it could go either way) There are already other ships on the way to Pandora from Earth, and there is no way for them to know to stop and no interstellar weigh-stations for the outgoing crew to stop at and warn the incoming ships.   That being said, we would assume that the next ship would arrive sometime in the next year.  Even if the humans had set up their shop to cultivate food in the base or altered local food sources sufficiently for human consumption, machinery demands repair parts.  Guns need bullets.  Basically, supply is needed and there is a very limited amount of machinery production and local procurement that the Humans could do.  And although they most likely maximize local production of needed items, it is very doubtful that they could do everything themselves.  At a minimum, yearly supply runs would have to be made.  More likely, monthly or quarterly supply runs would have to take place.  But we will go with yearly to give the Humans the benefit of the doubt.  The Na’vi would know this.  Not because they are logistic masters, but because some humans decided to stay behind.  And even the most disconnected, disenchanted with humanity crewmember would know when the supply ships come in.   And with access to base logs and records, they could most likely construct an idea of what will be coming in each shipment.  One year, maybe it is a squad of marines, a few helo’s and some machine parts.  The next year, it is a brigade of marines and so on.  Though they could most likely formulate a plan to defend themselves and even repulse the potential invaders, it is much easier to find a way to create a defense through diplomacy.  Each incoming ship would have contingency plans for this sort of occurrence in the form of a Standard Operating Procedure.  Ship wakes up, finds base turned over to Na’vi, brings up the SOP for hostile contingencies and follows it.  And unless each of these ships carries with them overwhelming weaponry (orbital glassing/nukes), the plan would most likely be to turn tail or to negotiate.  Even if there is overwhelming weaponry, it is likely that there is an escalation procedure, where contact with the base is first tried, and a political solution is first attempted.   With the Na’vi in control of the base, the pro-Na’vi humans will have access to the same SOP’s and protocols, so they will be able to at least start a dialog before the worst case scenario of Glassing occurs.  Their interests would best be served if they could convince the Commander of the incoming vessels to peacefully stand-down and start a dialog.  But if they could not show evidence that the insurgency was merciful to the humans that did surrender, then that dialog would most likely be short and followed by either a quick sprint back to Earth to get some reinforcements, or a quick glassing (assuming they did not want to try and take the facility by force, but that is a whole other can of worms).  The human’s would have to re-establish the base eventually if they plan on continuing operations.  This is a private company we are talking about here, so the base represents a significant investment.  And doing so by having to destroy a portion of the world-wide population would be extremely expensive and probably very unpopular back on Earth, if not outright illegal.  So, the best interests of both parties are served if the Na’vi can negotiate a more favorable mining contract allowance with the Humans and the Humans can re-establish operations peacefully.  Failure to do this could result in a collapse of the mining company, if not the economy of earth, for the humans.  It could also result in a “holocaust” of sorts for the Na’vi should the humans decide that retaliation is necessary.  So the Na’vi putting the humans back on their ships and sending them home was a shrewd political move, not ill advised."

CGPGrey,25gfe5,Sensical_Name,10,Wed May 14 11:11:13 2014 UTC,"I think this podcast (and most people on reddit, I assume) is at least partially wrong on net neutrality. Hear me out. I have examples.  Net neutrality is always presented as the obviously right thing to do. It's the battle of the big bad company extorting the smaller companies (startups), or the companies with less eyeball access (e.g. Google). And I really really agree that it's a problem. A problem that's a real threat to the Internet.  But here are some related good things that net neutrality would break:  VoIP providers With net neutrality I cannot sell a VoIP service that's ""good enough"". If I can't go to Comcast and buy better QoS than ""internet"" for transiting their network to their customers, then I cannot sell high quality voice to their customers. I can try, I can hope, but then the customer starts torrenting, or they get flooded, or there is a route flap. Net neutrality says that Comcast cannot set up fast-reroute MPLS circuits and cannot mark my packets EF. This will hurt the small upstart VoIP provider that actually has a better, more efficient, and cheaper service. It doesn't make sense that my phone service or TV breaks if I'm DDoSed.  Getting rid of legacy ATM networks ATM (not the bank or porn kind) is hugely expensive and slow, and needlessly so. You can provide the same QoS with Ethernet and MPLS (and other technologies). If I'm a mobile operator trying to replace my aging ATM network out to my base stations (eNodeB, NodeB, BTS) back to my core network (MGW, GGSN, etc..) net neutrality says that I cannot go to Sprint and buy high-QoS IP transit links. I have to own my own fiber?  What? (the podcast agrees that every operator digging down fiber is stupid) That makes investments in mobile network coverage needlessly expensive and I may just not do it. And the customer gets shafted. Or does net neutrality only apply to ""Internet""? Don't kid yourself, it's the same exact routers. If you allow non-internet circuits or tunnels to be high QoS, then I could just buy a cross-atlantic EF circuit (and terminate both ends myself) and be back to what people are objecting to.  Note that buying high-QoS L2 and L3 networks is done today. Legislation would actually break existing mobile networks, make them much much more expensive, or just make them withdraw mobile coverage. (or, more likely, get their legal departmen to interpret the law so that they break the spirit of it)  LTE voice is VoIP Screw interoperator QoS and you screw voice quality when roaming (and possibly when not. Remember, mobile core runs over the same routers as ""The Internet"").  I cannot run a telecom system where a DDoS of my Internet routers takes down my telephone service. And again, these are the same routers.  I can easily do this technically. Even if most people fail when they set up QoS, I'm a good network engineer and if you know what I'm talking about then you know that it's not impossible or even infeasibly hard.  So yes Grey, I do think that there is a reasonable argument to me made for the other side.  Edit: For the non-network engineers: ""more bandwidth"" does NOT solve the QoS problem."
CGPGrey,25gfe5,theonefoster,9,Wed May 14 19:17:48 2014 UTC,"I have a hard time following this argument precisely because I am not a network engineer.  As mentioned in the pod-cast, without the knowledge of the actual workings of network construction (and their proper terms) it is hard to understand.  Can you perhaps explain it more thoroughly than """"more bandwidth"" does NOT solve the QoS problem"", but in language the average internet user might be able to understand?"
CGPGrey,25gfe5,Kabvanof,5,Thu May 15 23:10:26 2014 UTC,"Short answer You can't provision all your links to be able to handle user traffic while DDoSed. DDoSes go to hundreds of Gbps and you can't give all users that amount of capacity. And if you do then they can DDoS you even more[1]. QoS is applying policy on what happens when you don't have enough capacity, if even for a few milliseconds.  Second reason is that microbursts (many packets come to an otherwise unloaded point at once) cause blips in the delay. Web browsing is perfectly fine with that, voice calls less so. QoS lets you define what happens when this happens.  Longer background I started to write before realising it was too in-depth to actually answer you, I'm just going to leave it here Imagine you have a router with three links of the same speed (A, B and C) and two packets come in at the same time on A and B, and should be sent out on C.  You can't send the packets at the same time, so you have to put them in a queue. On most routers this is a FIFO queue in hardware (those who are network engineers, bear with me). It has to be a simple FIFO queue to be able to maintain the huge speeds we have nowadays.  Immediately we have an issue: Which packet do we put first in the queue? What are the effects on the other packet? Obviously you want to first care about the integrity of the network, so network control should always be prioritised. (e.g. BGP, IS-IS and OSPF. Not ICMP). It's one thing if a DDoS can no longer carry useful user data, but if a DDoS actually causes a network to break down that'd be worse.  The packet that had to wait in the queue will be there for some number of nano or microseconds, and is therefore delayed a bit. How much? Well, it depends on the total size of the packets ahead of it in the queue (time to transmit those bytes is longer the more bytes there are, you only transmit at line rate). If a packet comes in and there's no room in the queue it will be dropped (and TCP will notice and slow down to ease the load on the network).  So the bigger buffer the better, right? Uhm, no. These queues are expensive, and also if you have 5 seconds worth of queue (huge!), if you have a lot of traffic you will queue all packets for 5s. Hardly good for interactivity. Sometimes it's better to drop and let senders slow down (the basis of TCP flow control).  Not only are the hardware queues expensive, they're also stupid. Just FIFO. What if the buffer is full and a VoIP packet comes in? You want that to incur as little delay as possible. (or, you know, someone doing remote surgery via virtual reality). So you create ""software queues"", that are more capable, more numerous, and cheaper. The hardware FIFO queue is now there only so that when the chip that lights the fibre is done sending packet 1, it can without any delay or computation pick up the next packet to be sent.  The job of the software queues is to make sure the hardware queue is never empty when something exists to be sent, because that'd waste potential bandwidth.  Key point It gets more obvious when you imagine that both A and B and sending full throttle to C sustained. What do you drop, because you have to drop half of it. Do you drop youtube, because youtube will scale down and reduce the load, getting to a working state. Or do you drop voice data, disconnecting every phone call transiting the link?  If I build my IP network to carry voice traffic, I will configure my software queues for things like: * separate software FIFO queue for only voice traffic. * this software queue has priority to fill the hardware FIFO queue. * anything else goes into a ""best effort"" software queue, whose packets only go to the hardware queue if the voice queue is empty. * if the voice queue gets more than 20% of the link capacity, drop packets. This makes sure a fault in voice can't take down ""other"". * Have voice network control software make sure there is capacity for a voice call before connecting a call (this is outside the data flow), giving people an error code instead of overloading the (voice) network.  That all said: You should not run your links full. If you are selling internet access on your best-effort traffic, then your core network should be FAR from saturated.  [1] If you don't have multicast you can actually give line rate any-to-any for a network. It's sometimes done between servers in a data centre, but absolutely not in consumer networks. If nothing else because not all users will have the same amount of bandwidth (ADSL depends on distance from base station, etc.)"

You could've also have mentioned that the ISP's claim that net neutrality rules prevent them from upgrading their network is invalid, since countries who have pioneered such rules (Northern Europe, Japan, South Korea, etc.) have some of the fastest, cheapest and most reliable internet in the world.  Heck, in Eastern Europe, where in some places people still poop in a hole in the ground, have faster and cheaper internet than the US. Anecdotal example, but here in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, I pay $20 for a 50Mbps fiber-optic (FTTB) connection."
CGPGrey,24roa5,prodan1234,15,Mon May 5 12:44:55 2014 UTC,"Another problem with the internet in the US is the ageing infrastructure. In the UK for examples, we have a lot less people over a lot smaller area, so it's a lot easier and cheaper to get faster speeds to people, as well as more companies offering internet services, to create competition, which is something the US kinds lacks.  EDIT: Spelling"

CGPGrey,24roa5,nerddoug,4,Mon May 5 16:33:26 2014 UTC,"This is actually related to one of the questions I had during the video. Is there any way net neutrality could be beneficial to the consumer? The video talks a lot about what service providers could do, but then if one service provider decides to not screw over the consumer they've just been given a giant leg up in terms of consumers. Is it possible they could, say, devote more bandwidth to the most commonly visited sites or something?"
CGPGrey,24roa5,StrategicSarcasm,14,Mon May 5 14:04:02 2014 UTC,"... but then if one service provider decides to not screw over the consumer they've just been given a giant leg up in terms of consumers.   How many big ISPs do you have in your city?  More than 2?  The thing most people don't realize: small ISP have ISPs.  If you're not going to build out your own nation-wide network, you're going to need to connect somewhere.    If you have only cable and DSL as your local options, you can choose to subscribe to a small, local ISP, and get your DSL from them.  Right?  Well, sort-of.  Not really.  The phone lines and provider DSL equipment is still owned and operated by the local big telco, who provides their own DSL service.  The data does get routed to your ISP, but they've got to have an upstream link somewhere.  Maybe they contract the cable co for that.  Maybe a telco.  And all the data coming in through that connection can already be shaped, before it even reaches your ISP.  Any way you slice it, the larger providers choice to include artificial ""fast lanes"" will still affect most ISPs, even if your own ISP wants to be consumer friendly."
CGPGrey,24roa5,gd2shoe,7,Mon May 5 15:53:57 2014 UTC,I jumped on this thread to talk against net neutrality... this is the best argument i have heard for it because I agreed with StategicSarcasm. You may have changed my mind.
CGPGrey,24roa5,taywill,3,Wed May 7 16:20:49 2014 UTC,devote more bandwidth to the most commonly visited sites or something?   Screws over competitors to these sites by enforcing the status quo.  It's like tax breaks to the big companies.

CGPGrey,24roa5,LukasFT,29,Mon May 5 12:26:40 2014 UTC,"Here's what I wrote:  The proposed Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet bill that would allow ISPs to charge online content creators for access to faster data lanes would cause irreparable damage to arguably the most important means of communication ever created. Not only should this proposal be shot down, but future legislature with similar goals should be illegal. Regardless of what misleading name is assigned to it, there is nothing at all ""open"" about the idea that the largest corporations in the country should be able to determine what information its citizens can reliably receive. While this may have been a popular idea at Chairman Wheeler's former role as head of the National Cable Television Association, it is an absolute violation of his current responsibility to represent the best interests of the United States public.  Information is a public good. The free and open transmission of information promotes the general welfare of our nation. This information should not be segregated into those that can afford to pay an ISP toll and those that cannot. Modern innovation is dependent on all entrepreneurs having access to the same infrastructure that their competitors do. Allowing large corporations to buy their way into prioritizing their content over all competition would be a huge barrier to any new company or individual attempting to offer a new and potentially innovative product or service to the public. True net neutrality means a free exchange of information between all people and organizations, regardless of their ability to contribute to election campaigns or hire politicians to cushy high paid executive roles.  It is in the best interest of all Americans (and ultimately all internet users worldwide, as our content creators deliver their data everywhere and this proposal would have far reaching effects) that we immediately classify ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act. Internet access is no longer a luxury; it is no longer a product. It is an essential tool for work, commerce, and the exercise of free speech, and a necessity for the vast majority of Americans. Broadband providers use public rights of way to install their cable across the country, and the government has an obligation to ensure that this allowed monopoly is not abused. Given that this installation of cable is controlled by local governments just as utilities are, it is only right that they should be classified and regulated as one. FCC Chairman Wheeler has already offered this as a solution if ISPs abuse this Open Internet legislation, indicating two things: first, that the Chairman acknowledges that this reclassification would be beneficial to a truly open internet, and second, that this current proposal does provide ISPs an opportunity for abuse. Although the Chairman feels that scrapping this proposal ""invites delay that could tack on multiple more years before there are Open Internet rules in place,” there are Americans all over the country who know that this is a fight worth fighting, regardless of how long it takes to get right. This decision will set long lasting precedents that will shape the future of this and all countries for years to come.  In addition, many ISPs themselves publish online content like streaming video, television, music and news. These same ISPs could use these proposed laws to throttle or block their own competitors, an obvious conflict of interest. How this is not immediately apparent to any legislator considering this proposal is astounding. ISPs like Comcast should not have control over the flow of information; they should be held responsible for providing equal and unrestricted access to all content to each and every subscriber. There are repeated claims by these same ISPs that their infrastructure can not handle current demands, which is why their customers often experience far slower speeds than advertised. How these same companies can now promise improved service, but only to corporations that shell out large payments, indicates that they do not have the best interests of their customers at heart. The idea of data congesting their infrastructure is a complete fabrication. If there weren't such monumental barriers to entry for new ISPs, their clients could express their disappointment by moving to an alternative carrier. For most of the nation there is only one broadband carrier available, and you're about to give them a green light to further abuse their customers and hold hostage every individual and company, large and small, who has an online presence. Can we really trust them to act appropriately when the FCC Chairman himself has indicated that there is potential for abuse?  In closing, this issue will never slip under the public radar. Every time a new SOPA, PIPA or ""Open Internet"" proposal is made, citizens like me will be here to fight it. I repeat: the only acceptable solution is to reclassify ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act. Then, and only then, will we be on the road to the internet that we as Americans and all citizens of the world deserve.  Sincerely,"

These are just random ideas.  :)  1) Learn how it works in your country. Do you have net neutrality? What is the mechanism by which net neutrality is / could be guaranteed (e.g., is there some legal status ISPs could be given, like ""Title 2"" status in the U.S.)? Are there any movements in your country / government to add/remove net neutrality?  (If so, you can respond to those.)  2) Monitor the situation both in your country and the U.S. Be aware of what's happening in the governments and regulatory agencies, and watch for any changes or proposals (good or bad).  3) I don't know if this is necessary or going overboard, but you could write to your own representative in your country to tell them that you think the U.S. is making a mistake by moving away from net neutrality and that you don't want to see that happen in your country. Tell them you want them to either (depending on whether you already have net neutrality or not) fight to keep the net neutral in your country, or fight to make net neutrality the law in your country.  Those are my thoughts. Anyone else have any ideas?"
CGPGrey,24roa5,afischer15,3,Wed May 7 01:09:21 2014 UTC,"Sadly, not much. I live in Denmark, EU, and we seem pretty safe for now, although that could quickly make a turn. But it will affect us a lot if a vote against net neutrality is passed, since we depend on US companies making money, so if they have the extra expense to pay to the ISPs, the cost will eventually end on your shoulders.   What I did, and what I think is the best to do, is described earlier ITT."
CGPGrey,24roa5,mename2332,1 point,Mon May 5 13:07:59 2014 UTC,"Choose elected officials that support network neutrality. Make it one of the policy positions you use to evaluate who you'll vote for and make that known.  One problem currently in the U.S. is that politics is awash with corporate money now that ""money = speech"" thanks to the US Supreme Court's ruling. For us, that is going to have to change before politicians will seriously consider ignoring corporate interests in favor of pro-consumer legislation."

CGPGrey,24roa5,i0x60,3,Mon May 5 12:19:34 2014 UTC,I'm glad that we have net neutrality in the Netherlands. In some situations there are some (in my opinion understandable) exceptions. For example the dutch railways offers free wifi in trains and it is allowed to block data hungry types of traffic like youtube. Since this connection uses the mobile network (3G as of right now) blocking things like youtube has the advantage that more people can make use of this service without congesting the connection.

CGPGrey,24roa5,borbus,2,Mon May 5 13:19:09 2014 UTC,"I think that net neutrality is like truthful media. We need trustworthy media outlets (and you'd be naive to think we have them now) just as we need ISPs that respect net neutrality. But legislating against ISPs tampering with our data is (like legislating against lies in the media) not necessarily a good idea. A better way to handle this problems is creating a public blacklist of non-neutral ISPs and untrustworthy media outlets and avoiding them. Maybe some people would like to buy access to just Youtube, or just Netflix for a cheaper price. Why not?"
CGPGrey,24roa5,ursineduck,2,Mon May 5 13:29:10 2014 UTC,"There is a difference though. The various news media outlets are content creators/providers and ISPs are just distribution providers. So here's an example of the proper analogy...  So let's just assume for a moment that you get all your news from news television, and you get that television from your cable television service. That cable television service in your area can be acquired from, let's say, Camcast , or... that's it. (That's basically how that works in the U.S. - although I am ignoring IPTV for the moment. Depending on your area, it may be someone else besides Comcast, but it's normally a ""choice"" of 1.)  Let's also suppose that Comcast doesn't like Fox News very much. I know that's not necessarily an unpopular opinion, but in this case it may not be due to political views but because Comcast-NBC happens to own a competing channel, MSNBC. Comcast could perhaps reduce the quality of service for Fox News, resulting in poorer quality reception, mysterious channel outages (for just that station), etc. while dedicating extra resources to their own MSNBC channel to make sure it always comes through in top quality.  To be clear, I'm not sure whether or note the above scenario of cable television being preferential is legal or not, but to the best of my knowledge no scenario like this has yet occurred. However, without net neutrality, it would certainly be legal for ISPs to do this...  So Camcast Cable may not be able to be preferential between Fox News and MSNBC, but Comcast Xfinity Internet service could definitely be preferential between streaming video coming from foxnews.com and from msnbc.com.  So the news providers are like the websites you want to visit, and the ISPs are more like the cable television service that brings the news from their station to your house. We don't want to legislate what the news services can say, but we do want to legally prevent the distribution mechanism from having the power to decide what we will and won't see."

CGPGrey,24roa5,hounvs,2,Mon May 5 15:27:02 2014 UTC,"Why are there so few ISPs? Because the infrastructure for the internet is very expensive and the regulations are complex. There is a high ""barrier to entry"" as an economist would say. There isn't really a good solution to making more ISPs. It's not financially practical to run 3-5 different internet cables to every house in a city. I'm not sure we could find space for all those cables.   The free market would benefit greatly from more competition, but there's not a good way to achieve that level of competition. When the free market breaks down in this way, we use regulators to correct for that. The regulators put pressure on companies the way competition would if it existed. It's not an ideal replacement, but having regulators is much better than not having them in situations like this one."
CGPGrey,24roa5,CultofNeurisis,2,Mon May 5 12:54:16 2014 UTC,"The last mile has always been the most expensive part.  The phone company and the cable company initially ran the lines out to the neighbourhoods where they were needed, and they owned them.  They were later used for internet access, and those companies still owned them.  There have been various laws in Canada, and I believe in the US, which allow competition and the use of those lines as a guarantee, but it's always an uphill battle.    I guess on one hand you've got the companies that initially paid money to put those lines up on poles or underground being asked to let everyone else use them.  The other hand has monopoly laws, fair use, competition, and whatever else other businesses want to use to get access to customers.  What did South Korea, Japan, and Bulgaria do, I wonder?

Internet without net neutrality is internet without progress or equality for the small business of idea and data creation. The internet's small idea/data/media creators are the source of a lot of art, music, writing, code, and good old innovation that keeps the internet running happily. Removing net neutrality allows large corporations to bully their way into control of data distribution, effectively choosing which streams of data survive and which fail. Removing Net neutrality is removing a cornerstone of the free and equal idea market which is the internet. Removing net neutrality creates space for a private, corporate middleman with the power to choose which websites load faster than others. We already have despicable cable monopolies in the USA, and removing net nuetrality will only increase their power to bully citizens for their money while stealing our would-be right of equal access to data. These bullies are the monolithic Internet service providers, private corporations who will take advantage of us and will ultimately choose what we can actually download IF we sacrifice net neutrality. To top it off, because they are monopolies, they control their prices (which are obscene in the US compared to the world stage). There is no free market and removing net neutrality will only make take away freedom from the users of the Internet. Finally, I want to protect net neutrality because I am already upset that this country allows monopolies to exist and bully their citizens for money, and I refuse to let these corporations take any step farther. I hope to see them dissolved in the near future, too."

I suppose it's possible that the backbone ISPs on the U.S. side of where the U.S. and Australia (or other countries) could do things similar to what we're worried about edge ISPs doings, but I'm not sure how much risk there is really of that. That's a situation of big companies making business deals with other big companies (not selling to us little guys), so the other partner in the deal may not stand for it and actually have the power to back it up."

CGPGrey,24roa5,s341,2,Mon May 5 12:33:55 2014 UTC,Clear message! Net Neutrality needs to stay.
CGPGrey,24roa5,xensure,4,Mon May 5 12:40:07 2014 UTC,"I always love watching your videos, because you usually provide a fairly unbiased explanation of how extremely complex things work, and while yours is one of the best explanations of how Net Neutrality works that I've seen, I still have to disagree with the opinion that you're stating.  The main reason that the internet is as awesome as it is because it allows peer to peer interaction and offers everyone connecting to the internet the same level of interaction.  The policy of Net Neutrality is a large part of the reason for the internet's general internetty-ness that we all love.  However, the lack of a Federally enforced Net Neutrality does not mean the end of Net Neutrality nor does it mean the end of everything that makes the internet awesome.  For starters, the FCC has only been regulating the internet since 2005.  Before then ISPs were free to do whatever they wanted, and yet the internet still grew and became very awesome before the rules were in place.  Net Neutrality is such a core aspect of the internet that damaging it would seriously damage the internet itself, which would seriously damage the demand for ISPs, which would be bad for ISPs, so they're actually incentivized in favor of the open network that we all know and love.  Even if some ISPs set up closed network policies, they'd lose lots of customers to their Net Neutral competitors.  Most people have two or three companies to choose from, odds are they probably won't all vie against Net Neutrality.  While the free market might not be a perfect solution, the issue there isn't a lack of Federal intervention, but a lack of competition, which has other solutions.  In areas where a government enforced Net Neutrality law is actually necessary, I see no reason that we can't get that law from state or local governments, like nearly every other utility.  Additionally we have the issue that the court was actually referencing when it made its decision, which is the constitutionality of the FCC's regulations.  While this may be hard for you to understand, living under Britain's 'Unwritten Constitution' where Parliamentary legislation has unquestionable authority, but in America we decided that giving a government entity unlimited regulatory authority would probably end badly.  We created a thing called the United States Constitution, it's essentially a contract agreed to between the 50 states saying that they will all agree to follow the laws created by a joint Federal Government.  The Federal Government is, in turn, only given authority to legislate over several very specific areas.  The use of a privately owned infrastructure to transfer information between third parties (i.e. not the owners of the infrastructure) is not on the list of areas they may regulate.  Additionally it may be considered speech or press, which means that in addition to not being allowed to regulate it, they're also explicitly banned from regulating it.  In general, I agree with the idea that the Federal Government shouldn't be allowed to overrule the document that allows the Federal Government to exist (an opinion that the Supreme Court also agrees with me on, see Marbury v. Madison).  However, the biggest reason for my opposition of the FCC is what it could possibly lead to.  I'm a strong believer that the more freedom the people have the better it is.  That's why the massive electronic network where everybody connected is free to do whatever they want on the network is such a great thing.  I also feel that human history has shown that the bigger and more involved the government becomes, the less free the people are.  Not to sound too Orwellian, because I'm confident that things won't get that bad in my lifetime (though I sometimes worry for my grandchildren), but I'm scared of what could happen if the government got control of the internet.  It's only a passive regulation now, but a little while later the policy changes to identify the thing being regulated as a public necessity.  Then it becomes a public good, which means it's a government owned good.  Now it can only be found or used with government approval, which is a very scary future for the internet, and the opposite of what the Net Neutrality movement is trying to protect.  That whole scenario may seem a bit implausible, but it's already happened here in America with many things including Roads, Airplane Flight Control, and of course the FCC's original designation: Radio.  Radio started as a two directional medium much like the Internet with anybody able to send a message that anybody else could here.  Then the FCC (at the time called the FRC) was created to regulate the medium, and today it requires an expensive government license to broadcast anything over radio.  This is a sad state for a once great information medium, and I truly don't want to see a repeat of this story happen with the internet, yet the FCC has a track record for doing this sort of thing.  Anyways, I'm really sorry if anything I said here shatters your whole argument (even though that was my entire goal), but given internet argument success rates we'll probably both walk away having none of our opinions changed.  Again, thank you for the great video, the first half was excellent at explaining what the internet and Net Neutrality are even if I disagree with the politics in the second half.  While I was writing this, I imagined it being narrated by your voice which probably says something about how awesome you've managed to make your channel.  To anyone who didn't look at this and instantly type TL;DR, thank you."
CGPGrey,24roa5,gd2shoe,2,Mon May 5 12:52:32 2014 UTC,"I think nothing you said comes anywhere near to shattering his argument. Most of what you said shows you are in favor of network neutrality but you are against the method. I think I can sum up everything you said into two points.    Competition will keep most ISPs from abandoning network neutrality I fear that the government will fuck up the internet at some point in the future.    1) In North America there is next to zero competition. Even in areas that have 2 or 3 providers do not compete with one another, they work together to keep prices high and limit outside competition. The best example of that is right here in Canada we have 3 major networks, Rogers, Bell and Tellus. There are other little providers but they all need to rent network access from one of the big 3 so they don't really count.   Every major move they have made has been a big fuck you to consumers. Bell and Tellus both on the same day decided to charge for receiving text messages. They want to double dip. Bell went on a campaign to implement metered usage so they can charge the smaller ISPs more for using data and customers would have a tiny cap of 60 gigs because their network was so overloaded. In the same week Bell introduced their own streaming services and said ""If you're with Bell, streaming from our services won't count towards your data caps."" So much for that overloaded network. When the rumor of Comcast entering the Canadian market started to spread, all three joined together and campaigned hard telling Canadian how wrong it would be to sell national resources to some foreign company, how unfair it would be to have the government aid the introduction of another company and just how fucking Canadian the big three are.   Things are not much better in the US. Comcast owns about 60% of the market and does what ever it wants. Google wants to install fiber in select towns and these towns are begging Google to select them because the current providers will not upgrade the network.   2) The whole idea that somehow in the future that the internet could become some sort of regulatory nightmare might be a concern if it weren't for the fact that right now ISP are trying to destroy what we know as the internet in the name of profits. You think that providers like Comcast want to protect the concept of Neutrality because damaging that will reduce demand and there for their bottom line? They really don't care because demand for internet is insanely high. People will take a watered down version and still pay for it. People will give up sex before they give up their data plan.   People want internet access so Comcast will start chopping it up into small and smaller pieces to offer you less and to test how much you will pay for each piece they cut off just so you can get it back. They have already started with throttling Netflix. Netflix caved and decided to pay Comcast to leave their data alone. They must have decided that paying Comcast was better or cheaper than delivering poor service to their customers. The question is that if someone owned another ISP of significance size, why are they not getting payed by Netflix as well and maybe they should throttle their data as well until they do. The next question is if Netflix was the number 1 source of all data, who is number 2? Google with their Youtube videos? They have deep pockets so why shouldn't they pay too? Extortion worked with Netflix so why not Google?  Government regulation is needed for any provider with a near monopoly. Time and time again when ever the Government has stepped back and allowed private industry to self regulate, the same thing occurs. Prices go way up and quality goes way down. The same arguments are made over and over again. ""Competition will keep these companies in line."" It never does. Now I'm not arguing for total Government control. I don't need big brother monitoring everything I do. They need to stay out of what I do with my internet but they need to make sure I have fair access to it."

Electric is billed as used and should be, since it is a finite resource. Internet service should never be metered. Once the infrastructure is built it does not cost more to supply a user 10 bits per day or 10 million. If every user started downloading videos at the same time speed might slow but the ISP will never run out of bits to deliver to you.  I know this isn't really what the video is about, but whenever the internet gets compared to a public utility, this is all I can think of."

Once the infrastructure is built it does not cost more to supply a user 10 bits per day or 10 million.   Is this actually true? I am not sure I agree with your sentiment that the internet should never be metered. I don't think being metered is equivalent to non-neutral. Does a fiber optic cable that has had 100k TBs pumped through it have wear compared to a brand new cable? Or is it just simply the age of the wire and being exposed to the elements that contribute to the wear?  Also it should be noted that each bit can be equated to a non-negligible amount of electricity. So who pays for the electricity along the way? And this isn't rhetorical. If I stream 1GB of data from YouTube, to send those bytes to me how much of the electricity necessary is paid for by YouTube and by me in comparison to how much is paid for by the ISP?  I think it may be perfectly reasonable for the ISP to charge me for the electricity that it costs to send me the bytes I consumed + the depreciation of the infrastructure + admin costs + a profit margin. (I will say with out competition to control those last two this model will not work, regional monopolies are a problem regardless of pricing models.) This price could be rolled up as a $/byte rate and I don't think that is against net neutrality. The electric company charges me a $/KwH so the biggest users will pay the most but the electricity is neutral because they don't charge a different rate depending on how you use the Kws. It would be non-neutral if the electricity company charged me a different rate for electrify dedicated to my A/C unit VS my refrigerator. A portion of the net-neutrality debate is centered around ISPs treating bytes unequally.  So a byte rate price structure does not necessarily mean non-neutral. At least I think so /r/changemyview if I am not understanding the complexity fully."
CGPGrey,24roa5,rkh00,2,Mon May 5 13:28:54 2014 UTC,"Electric is billed as used and should be, since it is a finite resource. Internet service should never be metered. Once the infrastructure is built it does not cost more to supply a user 10 bits per day or 10 million.   Is this actually true?   Over-simplified, but essentially true.  Equipment goes out over time and must be replaced.  Employees must be paid.  ISPs have electric bills.  Etc.  But the vast, vast majority of the expenses are one-time installation costs.    But all these costs must be met even if no traffic is flowing.  Taking the Internet out of the picture for a moment, it costs your ISP the same amount to send data between themselves and you as it does to send nothing.  So long as the line is functional, they're incurring costs.  The problem is upstream.  ISPs pay to connect to the big network providers who maintain the backbone.  Often, they pay per byte.  There is some sense here (less then they typically claim, but some).  The sum total of everyone's Internet burst speed added together is far greater than the total bandwidth that the backbones can provide.  This means during peak usage, there is only so much room on the thoroughfare, and charging per-byte can be argued for.  However, during non-peak usage, the same principle applies.  Having half a backbone lit costs about the same as if the whole thing was.  So it doesn't cost the major networks any to throw a few extra bytes across the world, but they charge for it nontheless."

One aspect of net neutrality that is being lost in the furor over the ""ISPs v. Netflix, et al."" discussion is that the current system of large companies using ISPs with settlement-free peering agreements with retail ISPs as content distributors is also the antithesis of net neutrality.   Net neutrality advocates are advocating for a system that itself is not neutral. True net neutrality would mandate that there is no special treatment, or pricing, for any player.  Option A, the way the retail ISPs want it, they will set pricing for users of their service.  Option B, the way large online companies want it they will set pricing for their usage, or at least push their costs onto consumers-- even if those consumers aren't using their services.  Net neutrality demands that all players should pay a fair share of their usage of the internet, and both options A and B will be bad for the consumer in the long run, A in the shorter long run and B in the longer long run.  Neutrality advocates should all sit down together and have some in-depth discussions with network engineers in order to form a vision of what they want.   Right now there is a lot of yelling and complaining by people who don't really have a full picture of what is going on. What neutrality advocates actually want (from what I can gather) is neither A nor B, and they should be advocating for Option C (whatever it may be) instead of the status quo."

CGPGrey,24htfh,Peregrine7,9,Fri May 2 15:53:34 2014 UTC,"I certainly agree, but in the same way that the Pragmatic podcast described that power plant explosion, there's something about the sequence of events that precede a disaster that I find extremely interesting.   (Thanks for that podcast recommendation, by the way..)  If it makes you feel any better, many aviation rules became standard after this event to prevent a recurrence, including the most obvious one: Two aircraft can't occupy a runway at the same time..."
CGPGrey,24htfh,Peregrine7,10,Fri May 2 17:22:09 2014 UTC,"Ugh, 2 made my blood boil. Having flown quite a bit from a runway that is dual use for pilot training and commercial aircraft (recipe for disaster, I know) I was once advising a guy on a PSC (Pre-Solo check, the last instructor flight before solo you run through a whole bunch of tests, everything that a tester could check you on). This guy wasn't my student, and I wasn't going to be testing him, so I did the normal thing and let him handle as much as possible. When advised to run kilo through L-november to hold short on takeoff (27R) he taxied straight for november across the grass from the holdpoint (on the dirt, small a/c) dodging an active fuel-truck and skipping another taxi aircraft. He then turned right heading West on November, against the taxi pattern, crossed runway 18 (cross runway) which I let him do as it wasn't active. We then got to Lima, which I pointed out. He checked his airport brief... despite the fact he should have known this airport pretty well by now, his log had at least two dozen flights from here, and said the dumbest line I've ever heard.    ""Oh, they must've put the sign up wrong"". He then tried to run-up on the taxi-way centre-strip and went left on Lima (oh god) and came up to the active runway 18R at about the 2/3 mark. He didn't call intention or anything, just coasted. So I took the a/c, called to tower that the current flight plan was cancelled and that we were req RTO from Lima/18R. That got quite a reaction. I just wordlessly passed my notepad to his instructor and cancelled his test for him. Saved him a shitton of money that day. I didn't even charge him for my time.   Some people..."

It won't take long for you to understand the taxiways, but I bet you one of the first things they'll teach you is taxiway/runway procedure (i.e. the taxiways are on one radio frequency and the runway is on the ""air"" frequency, the runway is effectively another part of the sky). Even if you make a mistake on the taxiways the main things to know are 1) The taxiways are labelled correctly, always and 2) If you come across a marking that is dashed on one side and solid on the other, you've come to a runway threshold, check out what taxiway you're on and what your heading is so you know which runway you've hit and where, and then contact the tower for permission to enter the runway. If you do those two things you'll be fine, getting lost on the taxiways, though fairly rare, shouldn't be a big deal."

CGPGrey,24htfh,ironsballs,4,Fri May 9 11:12:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks for these. I also enjoy these types of documentaries /  break down (or whatever they are called). There used to be a show on here in the US called ""Air Emergencies"" that would have all kinds plane emergencies stories (and not all crashes and death). It was incredibly fascinating to watch how everything broke down (communication, technology, basic common sense, etc) and led up to the event. My favorite are always the one that blow away my previous understandings or beliefs and teach me something.  Then there are others, like that second one, that infuriate me (but that I still enjoy watching). I can't believe that it took so long (and probably longer since the video stopped) for that controller to accept the possibility the plane might be in the wrong position and in the middle of a runway. Kudos to the pilot at the end of 5r for staying back and not blindly trusting the controller's orders for take off.   Unfortunately the ""Air Emergencies"" program was always on in the middle of the day and was out of production by the time we got a dvr. I was left with only a handful or two of reruns to watch. Then I left for college,  graduated, and have never bought a TV subscription. I'm still trying to find ways to watch more of these types of programs. Thanks for sharing!"

After all, there have been feature length movies made about this event and questions still arise.  Ultimately, the KLM captain takes a lot of blame for the crash. I think the language used by the tower can be a huge contributing factor as well, though. The FO of the KLM requested takeoff clearance, but was not granted it. Instead the tower simply gave directions of what to do after takeoff. The KLM captain either misunderstood or ignored this and began takeoff.  Most reports I've read credit the majority of the blame on that one thing. Weather, frustration, unclear comm's, among several other factors also played a role."

I have a Sonos system at home but I'm unable to listen to your podcast through the Sonos speakers.  I know I can use the crappy Apple Podcast app and then let the Sonos app play it from my iPhone, but I prefer the app Downcast."

CGPGrey,23p2ei,eatbachelorchow,157,Tue Apr 22 18:16:13 2014 UTC,100 podcasts and a movie!
CGPGrey,23p2ei,SpicyDisco,26,Tue Apr 22 22:03:44 2014 UTC,everyone knows you can't make a movie until you get to season 6
CGPGrey,23p2ei,quesopano,3,Wed Apr 23 03:35:56 2014 UTC,.... I'd say Firefly defied this but the trade off was only 1 season ....

CGPGrey,23p2ei,devinatkin,6,Wed Apr 23 03:41:04 2014 UTC,But would you pay handsomely
CGPGrey,23p2ei,shadingtree,24,Thu Apr 24 14:27:52 2014 UTC,Perhaps Grey could have a Subbable page for this as well?!
CGPGrey,23p2ei,PapaHudge,17,Wed Apr 23 04:02:15 2014 UTC,Would you be willing to pay money to audible.com or SquareSpace?
CGPGrey,23p2ei,seppo0010,15,Wed Apr 23 00:49:18 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, I'm not interesting in either of those products, but I would consider donating directly to the podcast.  -edit- changed ""neither"" for ""either""."

CGPGrey,23p2ei,Xeno_man,14,Tue Apr 22 22:54:21 2014 UTC,Also Brady's paper cuts. You don't introduce a new segment for the podcast if it's only going to be used once. Segment implies a reoccurring category.
CGPGrey,23p2ei,SaunaChump,12,Wed Apr 23 05:35:09 2014 UTC,So many more than 10. Way too big of a cliffhanger to leave unused. And I liked the last 7 more than the first 3. So keep on bringing those podcasts of two youtube dudes talking.

I've also spend my fair amount of time in Flight Simulator and even listened to the local airport's ATC a couple of times. It's just interesting, I guess it's somewhat the same kind of fascination that people have with cars. So I've got the ask, do you (or any other redditer) have any favourite planes?  I personally love the looks of the McDonnel Douglas MD-11 - which my country still uses. The F-16 which just looks like a flippin' dart piercing through the air and of course the iconic Spitfire."

CGPGrey,23p2ei,vmax77,7,Tue Apr 22 18:47:36 2014 UTC,I don't get why teachers don't better balance how much home work/final projects/final exams/tests/mid-terms are worth. Making participation 5/10% of the final mark makes sense but I don't get why they make things so unbalanced like this
CGPGrey,23p2ei,Kronf,14,Tue Apr 22 19:06:15 2014 UTC,"If I ever taught in a school that used that system, I would make the homework worth 5% precisely because many kids probably wouldn't bother.  Makes no difference to the end results and less marking to do."
CGPGrey,23p2ei,Bakirelived,9,Tue Apr 22 19:53:14 2014 UTC,But how frequent would you give them homework to do and how much time would each assignment take (should they choose to take it)?   swoons over getting a response from the man himself

CGPGrey,23p2ei,Rowen_Stipe,5,Tue Apr 22 20:36:30 2014 UTC,"Would you extend this theory to ""inverted classrooms""? If the lecture were viewed at home and then revision + Q&A conducted in classrooms - would that negatively impact results?  My understanding of an inverted classroom is that information is presented first out of class, and then reviewed in-class (whereas in a standard classroom information is obviously presented in class and students review/practice this outside of class).  Basically I think the concept is that you'd have an x-minute lecture to watch every night / week / whatever - and the actual classroom time would be more seminar, Q&A, quizzes(?), etc."
CGPGrey,23p2ei,molten,13,Tue Apr 22 20:31:14 2014 UTC,"It always felt to me that the most efficient learning happened in the run up to the GCSE exams.

My guess is 90% of right answers on the test came from those couple weeks."

CGPGrey,23p2ei,caldnar,20,Wed Apr 23 01:59:04 2014 UTC,"10th! (I'll edit my opinion of the podcast in here later)  The ending! That was horrible :D I was certain it wouldn't be abrupt because there was still time left. You sneaky people.  Still in agreement about the education topic.  I'd noticed the shift into the 'two dudes talking' genre, but I've been fine with it. Being a successful Youtuber (or something with similar independence and impact) must be the dream of many so I guess it's interesting to see 'behind the scenes' a bit, even if it's not directly related to the craft. There's nothing wrong with random anecdotes either, they can be fun to listen to. I think you make a good double act as the robot and the empath/questioner. It was funny when you entertained the idea that Brady was the robot. Perhaps that's another thing to discuss - why do we often find role reversal funny and/or satistying?  Anyways, thanks for the ten podcasts guys! You should perhaps have a contest/vote about what topic you should do next, or what segments you could add to the show. I've got a few ideas, but I don't want to go on a complete tangent here."

I'm coming to the end of medical school in the UK and a while back spoke to one of my lecturers who [and I'm paraphrasing] said ""It's great doing my job, I get to inspire people about a topic I love... and if they don't like it or if I'm having a bad day, well, it doesn't matter because they'll learn it anyway. You could put medical students in a cave with a list of learning objectives and they'd complete it without any of us.""

Especially with the last half of the 10 episodes, it really does feel like a conversation between the audience and the two of you, as opposed to other mediums that feel more like people are talking at you. Like, real feedback from real viewers has made its way into a finished product online, being referenced to and expanded on! How wonderful is that! Personally, I don't feel like I see that enough online anymore.  In all my years of being a YouTube viewer, I've never felt so involved, and I think Hello Internet has reminded me of how interlinked viewers really are to the creators of content.

It does not explain interpretations of one's own behavior, where situational factors are more easily recognized and can thus be taken into consideration. The flip side of this error is the actor–observer bias, in which people tend to overemphasize the role of a situation in their behaviors and underemphasize the role of their own personalities.

So not only can I point others to this video, I also now know myself.  Also, to add to your closing remarks: While it may seem like Hong Kong has been left untouched, it is evident to the long time citizens that this is not the case. There has been a large influx of mainland Chinese as well as a large out-flux of foreigners. It is widely known by the people that China does want to absorb Hong Kong as another one of its cities, and has shown an increasing ""concern"" in the matters of the government. But, as China does, it has stayed relatively quiet to everyone about it.  My best story was when a friend asked if I could speak Japanese well, now that I've been living in Hong Kong for a while."

I'd be interested in seeing videos about the unincorporated territories of the US and the movements for statehood, eg for Puerto Rico.   And if there's any significant development soon, you could make a video about Cyprus. What, with Cypriot enclaves in UK soil, UN patrolled strips of land around inhabited villages, ceasefires that ran through warehouses, our borders are crazy, and we hope to get rid of them soon."

But the political system of Hong Kong, Macau and China is not entirely independent. Beijing wire funds to pro-Beijing political parties here each year, making them win elections against local pan-Democrats and the Chief Executive (Equivalent to President) is usually a pro-Beijing guy (e.g. Current HK CE Leung Chun-ying, Former HK CE Donald Tsang, etc. ), so although technically the political systems are separate, they are not."

Macanese actually refers to ethnic Portuguese people born in Macau. 2. Not the whole Hong Kong was leased for 99 years. Hong Kong Island, Old Kowloon and the Stonecutters Island are CEDED. Only New Kowloon and the New Territories are leased.﻿ 3. Cantonese are the most commonly used language in both Hong Kong and Macau. English is another official language in Hong Kong and Portuguese is another official language in Macau. 4. The tone of the video sort of implies that Hong Kong and Macau now are just like when they're still British/Portuguese colonies. Hong Kong and Macau are becoming more like ordinary Chinese cities now. More schools are teaching teaching Mandarin in Hong Kong. The HKSAR government allow 150 Chinese people to move to Hong Kong DAILY (that's a lot). I can go on. But I think you get the idea."

CGPGrey,22loh8,toastydays,16,Wed Apr 9 14:05:54 2014 UTC,"No, the treaties are still valid as PRC counts as the 'successor state' to Qing China and so all the treaty counts. The same thing goes for debts, etc."

CGPGrey,22loh8,Joeytje50,11,Wed Apr 9 13:46:32 2014 UTC,"Which is ironic because the ROC government was a founding member of the UN. So it's more like Taiwan was kicked out of the UN once it became inconvenient for other countries to sour relations with the PRC, who is now a permanent member of the UN security council."
CGPGrey,22loh8,B787_300,4,Wed Apr 9 14:43:10 2014 UTC,"So it's more like Taiwan was kicked out of the UN   As the great-nephew of a former ROC ambassador, family lore states that a compromise was offered: the PRC would take over the Security Council seat, but the ROC would get its own seat in the General Assembly. Chiang refused, as a matter of 面子.  It was commented upon in the Foreign Ministry at the time that ""our grandchildren will grovel at the feet of the UN to be let back in, and they will rue the day we made this decision."" I don't know about groveling, but they weren't entirely off the mark, were they?"
CGPGrey,22loh8,molecularpoet,2,Thu Apr 10 06:39:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it's kind of messed up... On the other hand, that whole pesky civil war that they had, the PRC largely won it, minus an island, so I'd kind of think the winning side gets to take over the former country's role, if they wanted to take over (and they obviously have). So PRC, for better or worse, earned China's spot via- bloodshed."
CGPGrey,22loh8,yc_hk,3,Wed Apr 9 16:33:17 2014 UTC,"Sure, the outcome of the war and its spoils were earned fair and square. I even believe it's ultimately the KMT's fault that Taiwan has poor international recognition. Then again could they have known Taiwan would evolve into what it is today? That's why there's so much social unrest in Taiwan at the moment. Taiwan has reached a point where, although we are ethnically Chinese, modern Taiwanese society and culture bears little resemblance to mainland China. Despite this, the KMT continues encouraging the mainland's denial of Taiwan's sovereignty with their perpetuation of One China policies. Taiwan's younger generations accept and even pride in the fact that Taiwan is a separate entity, but obviously some people still aren't ready to move on yet."
CGPGrey,22loh8,system637,2,Wed Apr 9 17:49:07 2014 UTC,"While I admire Taiwan's younger generation for wanting to be their own thing... I'd think the lingering elephant in the room is Taiwan's older generation never officially finished the mess that got everyone where they are today. The mainland hasn't forgotten (and nor do the look to forget anytime in the near future).   Taiwan's Allies (USA?) are of the opinion ""Let's not talk about it right now, there is One China, and let's not upset the status quo"". If, and when, Taiwan's younger generation goes and rocks the boat (which is probably inevitable), then this will pretty much ensure a violent outcome for everyone involved.  I really want to see a peaceful outcome to this that leaves all sides happy though, my biggest fear is that there won't be."

(Britain had guns at this point while China only had cannons...) So Britain started attacking China in 1840, in the 鸦片战争 (Grey said it in English in the video, it was something like ""Opean Wars""?) Anyways, China lost, and started giving parts of Hong Kong away to Britain. And with 1 more attack, China lost more of Hong Kong to Britain. China and Britain then signed that China will give the third part of HK to Britain for 99 years, but after 99 years, China got the entire HK back... (I don't know much about Macau, I'm sorry...)  Anyways, fast forward to 1978. Deng Xiaoping started the economic zones （经济特区,EZ）in an attempt to influence HK, Macau and Taiwan more. The first 4 EZs were: Shenzhen (which share a boarder with HK), Zhuhai, (which is right next to Macau), Xiamen (which is the Chinese city that's closest to Taiwan), and Shantou. Than China opened more EZs, and it basically brings us to today...  (Yeah, I'm sorry, this was long... China has a complicated history...)"

To my knowledge, many people in Hong Kong are worried about the mainland Chinese government's influence on Hong Kong politics and economy. Some complained about more censorship in journalism and the publishing industry.Others worry that the economic dependence of Hong kong on the mainland would give the mainland more bargain power in the politics domain, especially when the rich in Hong Kong are those who profited the most from trading with the mainland and they have great influence on Hong Kong politics. After all, the rich in Hong Kong don't need to care much about democracy in Hong Kong as they are almost always holding more than one passport. There should have been a referendum in Hong Kong and Macau about whether they want to be independent before they're returned to China, I think...  Many Taiwanese are worried they'll be the next as well. That relates to recent news on Sunflower student movement in Taiwan, which I also find quite interesting..."

Or a more extreme example: My 1 year old self, my 6 year old self and my 16 year old self have huge differences in character, appearance and so on.  But not only my appearance and my character changed: Every single day, I lose molecules and atoms and gain new ones. I slowly exchange every single atom in my body. Over and over again.  The man in the comic chose the most drastic interpretation of that: That he dies in fact every single day. I would not agree with him. We Change every Single day. But just because you change, does not mean that you are not you anymore. Look at a car, for example. It is your favorite car, you have it for 20 years now. You gave it a paintjob 5 years ago, a new windshield last month, a new engine and some breaks after the last inspection. New wheels every now and then, new tires every season. You probably changed the covers and upgraded the radio. And you replaced serveral other parts as well, because the original parts rusted away.  But is is still YOUR car. It is still the car you bought 20 years ago. How could it not be? You never changed the car, only parts of the car. And even if you exchanged every single part of it: It would still be your car. Still the one you bought.   And that's how I see it. Plus, we humans grow overtime. We gain a lot of experience, we gather memories, we do stuff we can remember. I might not have the same character, the same molecules... but i still have my scars, my triumphs, my love, my memories..."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,Bernem,60,Sat Apr 5 14:35:43 2014 UTC,"I just have a comment about learning computer programming. It's not the language or the syntax that is important; most popular programming languages have online resources you can check if you forget a particular syntax or whatever. IMHO the most important thing about learning computer programming is concepts and practice. If you understand a concept, you can apply it to whatever language it is in. Of course there are some languages that are designed to work on a particular paradigm, but overall the most important things to remember are concepts and practices in coding. I wanted to point this out because a lot of people relate foreign languages to coding. They are the same in some ways, but not in the most straightforward kind."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,baudtack,29,Mon Mar 31 13:18:31 2014 UTC,"As a programmer, I completely agree with you. Syntax and language is absolutely unimportant. It's all about the concepts and the programmer's mind-set.  For example, I often have to solve bugs. This requires careful thinking, analysis and elimination to find the cause, and then more thinking and analysis to determine how to fix it. Just these qualities, which are also useful in many scientific studies, would be a reason for me to teach my children computer programming, even if they would never use it again in the future. Programming classes should be taught in school just like mathematics.  Edit:  However, I really don't think spreadsheet 'programming' would be sufficient. It is way too limited for this. It will teach you IF, and that's it. Everything else can only be accomplished by using the built-in functions, and there is no way to define your own or find out how they work. Also, you can't learn programming concepts, will never use programming constructs such as stack and hash tables, and bug-hunting (think, analyze, eliminate) is virtually non-existant with such a limited language."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,gildarok,6,Mon Mar 31 14:40:40 2014 UTC,"I disagree on your point of spreadsheet programming. In my previous company I was the most technically savvy guy in my department, and I end up writing a lot of what simple programs using lookup tables and such in Excel. Partly because I could accomplish what was needed, and partly because then everyone in the department could use what I had created."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,ajs124,5,Mon Mar 31 16:40:07 2014 UTC,"And did you feel Excel was the right tool for the job? I'm not saying Excel can't be used for advanced purposes, but it sounds to me that you have a programmer's mind that allows you to think outside the box of limitations of Excel to get what you want. That's something you'd have to learn beforehand.  If I want my kids to learn the higher-level concepts, abstractions and ideas of programming and give them problems that elicit analytical and critical thinking, then I wouldn't use Excel. Using the wrong tool to teach something will only teach them wrong or make it harder than necessary."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,djcrazyarmz,3,Mon Mar 31 17:04:57 2014 UTC,"partly because then everyone in the department could use what I had created.   I think the above statement is an extremely important part of developing an application. Even if the programmer of the application can think outside the limitations, at the end of the day it should come down to how your user is able to use it. Doing something in excel for non tech savvy people gives them a comfortable environment they are used to while your provide the the tool to more efficiently do their jobs. I am sure the same can be achieved in a substantially more efficient way in a separate application but there is now an additional barrier to entry that some users may feel they don't need to cross."

Excel is very good for organizing information, and other people are comfortable using it. But, I need to convert that table into something the program can use, so I use Visual Basic. I never remember the syntax. I never remember the formatting. But that is all lookup-able. As long as you know you need to use a loop to iterate over all elements,  and know what operations you want to do on the data, looking up the syntax for whatever the language you need to use now is fine."

CGPGrey,21tn8w,HashPram,2,Tue Apr 1 01:40:32 2014 UTC,"I agree with you. It's training in a way of thinking almost. You have a problem/opportunity, you formulate a method to overcome the situation, build and test it. Basically the engineering method.   The foundations you learn are applied to a new language that may be invented or that you discover. I studied engineering and one of our core classes was around problem solving but we used C++ as a tool. Having learned C++ I could go on to learn Python, PHP, whatever. Wish that I did more of it in high school."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,sirroy12,2,Mon Mar 31 18:24:54 2014 UTC,"As an iOS developer, I can't help but point this out. While Objective-C (the language iOS uses) is built on top of C, it is as much like C as Javascript, C# and dozens of other languages.  But I completely agree that what language we teach is important so much as the concepts. Similar to music, once you know how to play one, it becomes easier to learn another. And the more instruments you know how to play, the easier it is to learn more.  I would however, be more supportive of teaching kids something similar to music theory, but for computers. Our life is full of computers, but most people, even people that take advantage of them wherever they can, understand anything about how they work."

CGPGrey,21tn8w,cault187,17,Mon Mar 31 15:53:22 2014 UTC,"Well, we couldn't call someone an ""ol' sports""."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,TCARROTS,5,Mon Mar 31 19:07:06 2014 UTC,"It's a matter of linguistic perspective.  We don't typically say ""waters"", especially when referring to three cups filled with ... well water.  They may be separate and distinct in their organization (definitely in different cups), but we still don't distinguish them as separate objects, but identify them by their substance.  The word ""maths"" sounds like a collection of distinct things put in a bag.  In a way, what is taught in school is a collection of algorithms, techniques, and perspectives that helps one manipulate numerical data.  But in a different light, what should be conveyed is the unbounded and continuous study of how to understand logical structures.  Thus, it depends on how ""math"" is defined.  If ""a math"" is a thing, distinct and separate from other ""maths"", then the British way would be correct.  If ""math"" is defined as a philosophical substance, with a variety of tools (ex: algorithms) to deal with it, then the American definition would be correct.  Maybe I should say that they're both correct, but there's a bit of a terminology disjunct in exactly what math is.    The issue works the same way, but in reverse when it comes to sport/sports.  Americans tend to see sports as distinct things.  By way of demonstration: http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-02/enhanced/webdr06/24/8/anigif_enhanced-30967-1393247597-2.gif  I'm guessing that the British would have not trouble considering that to be sport, albeit very odd.  However, the poster suggest that it might not be, but ""needs to"" become ""a real sport"".  Sports, in America, have rules and bodies that officiate how to play.  You can have league rules, or house rules, but if you don't have rules and some kind of authority, you don't have a sport.  (Yes, they have rules in the UK too, but I'm guessing that ""sport"" includes just about any competitive physical activity.  Someone who lives there can feel free to correct me, or add nuance.)"

I'm a trivia host/question writer and so I'm on a rolling 7 day deadline of having to come up with a specific number of questions by a certain time without fail. There are two techniques that I use to accomplish that.  The first is that I have a very strict structure. Q1 is always a Who Am I question based on someone who was born in the following week (therefore during the week that I will be using the question). This allows me to narrow my focus and reduces the complication that too much choice introduces.  The second thing is that I have certain places I go either physically or virtually that feeds inspiration. If I am having trouble writing a movie question, I'll go to Rotten Tomatoes or Netflix to be exposed to films that I might not ordinarily think of. Hulu for tv. I have a huge world map on my wall for geography. I'll go to my local supermarket website for my Brands topic question etc. By having set places I know I can go for inspiration (that regularly rotate content), it means that I'm constantly being exposed to new directions to go in which ensures I'm not just writing the same 5 questions over and over again.  I'm very familiar with Grey's work but obviously not on how those scripts come together. Writing comes very naturally to me but those two techniques have helped keep motivation highish and go towards warding off procrastination.

In this case, the transporter does not destroy/scan all of you per se, and you either move into the new body, or the new body gets a new soul. This depends on rules of souls if they do indeed exist. This scenario hardly answers any questions because the parameters are mysterious. You are nothing more than the collection of matter and energy (nature) that we arbitrarily define as you. I think it would be difficult to actually make the case that you do exist. Your definition may seem important to a human's mind, but what is so inherently important about humans' minds? Humanity and life are equally arbitrary. Barring the arbitrary abstract reality of your actual existence, you don't really exist. So you don't die or cease to exist when you are transported.

CGPGrey,21tn8w,hanoobslag,6,Mon Mar 31 17:37:17 2014 UTC,"I definitely can sympathize with Grey in the writing process taking forever.  In school, I always (elementary on up to grad school) preferred tests to writing papers, because I would do a certain amount of studying and say, ""Eh, I know this stuff already,"" then quit studying, show up for the hour, two hours, eight hours for the test and move on with my life.  But with writing a paper, I would agonize over each sentence and re-write each paragraph over and over, check my research over and over, edit and re-edit, incorporate new research, tear everything up from the roots and start from scratch.  So by the time I was able to pick courses, I just avoided ones with papers (either serial writing or term papers/theses) and tended to do well on courses with exams.  Which is another example of how school doesn't prepare you for real life, because nothing in my life corresponds to an exam, but I do write quite a bit at work and I still have trouble not putting in overly-long work days because I take forever to write a decent paper.  Maybe I should work for a newspaper too."

CGPGrey,21tn8w,vin_edgar,5,Tue Apr 1 19:44:05 2014 UTC,"The difference between how Brady makes videos and how Grey makes videos is the difference between what I do for a living (manufacturing scale model kits) and someone who builds model kits.  I have a friend who can say on a weekend ""I want to build a model of subject X"" pulls the box off the shelf and builds the model. He might build 4 models in a week. For my part, If I say ""I would like to make a model of subject X"", I have to spend weeks researching the subject and getting dimensional data. Then I have to design and create masters for the partset and other things like decals, I make molds and cast the parts. THEN I have to make instructions and build the model for photography on the box art. I am really doing well, if I release 6 new kits in a year.  When Brady decides to video a subject, he goes to an expert and has them talk about it on camera. His skill is getting them to say enough of the right stuff to edit to a final cut. Grey has to do all the legwork and fact checking stuff himself, much like I have to do to create an accurate model kit."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,andhesawitwasgood,9,Wed Apr 2 18:19:05 2014 UTC,"Anyone else notice how often Brady says 'you know'? 4 times in the first minute and that not anomalous.  Just wondering, Love Brady and the show"

CGPGrey,21tn8w,rlamacraft,10,Mon Mar 31 21:41:15 2014 UTC,"Greetings to Brady and Grey. I've loved your videos and podcasts including the 'Delete Flag Delete Reply' but in today's episode Grey mentioned deleting an email that had 1600 words.  I do understand that CGP Grey is someone with a lot on his plate but I do believe that no one would write 1600 words just to reiterate something you've already mentioned or not have anything substantive or worth attention in that particular e-mail. You could even speed read through it using one or the other soft wares available all over.   Also, in my humble opinion, just the fact that you are opposed to an idea should not be enough reason to downright dismiss it."

I'm mildly consoled by the fact that I wouldn't have been able to go anyway because it was during the day and I was at work. Any plans to come back to Sheffield and do a talk a bit later in the day?"
CGPGrey,21tn8w,Stauffenberg41,7,Mon Mar 31 13:40:44 2014 UTC,no plans yet - but hope to see you next time!
CGPGrey,21tn8w,CrowClone,2,Mon Mar 31 13:48:53 2014 UTC,how do we get to know your calendar? It would be nice to attend one of your talks
CGPGrey,21tn8w,Beakerish,5,Mon Mar 31 18:10:46 2014 UTC,"I agree with the language lessons in school not actually teaching students how to speak that language (in the UK - or my high school - at the very least). Both of our writing and speaking assessments in French are planned weeks in advance, and the questions we'll be asked are given to us then as well. And all we're really marked on is how well we can say complex sentences that we've been planning for for almost a month. A couple of people in my class may have got very close to full marks, but I doubt they'd be able to say even the simplest thing if it had to be spontaneous. This is, I imagine, mainly because the bulk of what we do in lessons is reading and adapting sentences so we can shove them into our own work as and when we please  - there's very little teaching of grammar or rules, since - apparently - that's irrelevant to learning the language (when what they actually mean is that knowledge (especially spontaneous knowledge) of grammar and rules are not necessary to get a good grade on the exam.) This is a shame because I think knowing a second language is both useful and satisfying, but the schools (or the government, or the exam boards - whoever you wish to blame) fail to understand that this method will not produce anywhere-close-to-fluent speakers of foreign languages."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,cymatist,4,Mon Mar 31 16:46:45 2014 UTC,"Grey, have you ever accidentally skipped a lesson because you rehearsed it so much? My dad did that once, as a substitute teacher, before he went and got his teaching degree."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,klausateca,3,Mon Mar 31 19:21:05 2014 UTC,"Suggestion: Limit feedback to a set amount of time at the beginning of an episode.   Benefits: Only the most important feedback points are covered, the main body of discussion is started more quickly.  Rationale: The first ~30mins of this podcast was feedback. Not complaining, but this may be too long if you don't want to get stuck for too long on one topic.  I have tried to write this comment with CGP grey approved efficiency."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,mikeyReiach,3,Wed Apr 2 15:02:19 2014 UTC,"I personally enjoy the current feedback because it allows the topics to come to more of a sense of completion.  If the feedback is a problem for many people, maybe it could be released in a separate file? This would allow people to optionally skip it, and I feel like it would be a relatively simple edit."
CGPGrey,21tn8w,interwebs1214,3,Thu Apr 3 15:40:55 2014 UTC,"Apparently, you are the only allowed thread starter in this group.  I have no problem with that...but....  How about starting a separate thread for each topic per episode?"
CGPGrey,21tn8w,iron_dinges,10,Thu Apr 3 04:55:49 2014 UTC,"I personally think that this podcast should run in ""seasons"".  Each season can be 10 episodes and there can be 3-4 months between seasons because, let's face it, Grey and Brady have lives to live beyond this podcast.  In those 3-4 months, new podcast ideas can emerge and it can be just enough time for the podcast to lose hype just in time to bring it back for the next season!  I think that would be amazing for both the two podcasters and the audience!"
CGPGrey,21tn8w,ZwiebelKatze,2,Mon Mar 31 14:19:17 2014 UTC,10? I one a week that's like 2 months uptime to 4 months downtime or really 2 but still I don't think a weekly podcast will wreck their schedules
CGPGrey,21tn8w,bj_waters,5,Mon Mar 31 15:58:28 2014 UTC,"But they do consistently say that they don't have enough to talk about... So if they have a few months of downtime, that will allow them to find new ideas to talk about.  Also, at once a week, 10 episodes would take 2.5 months, but since Grey puts out a YouTube video every 5 weeks, I would assume that there wouldn't be a podcast during the week he puts out a YouTube video. So we can safely assume that 10 episodes take about 3 months. 3 months up and 3 months down don't seem very unreasonable.  I agree, a weekly podcast typically does not require much effort, but this is not a typical podcast. They rely heavily on feedback, I'm sure they read through virtually every comment on this subreddit's postings, and that takes time. Also, they do frequently travel the world, so arranging a time slot of almost 2 hours that each of them is free in the different time zones can be difficult I'm sure. And don't forget that Grey is a stickler for perfection, so he's going to take the time to edit the podcasts, which also takes time and effort.  Yea, it would be great if they just kept going with a podcast every week, and if they can do it, I would be more than happy to have that happen! But if it's not financially stable enough to do it continually, I think a ""seasons"" approach would be acceptable!"

CGPGrey,20mohu,thomas_dahl,7,Mon Mar 17 20:54:19 2014 UTC,"Take out the programming content. ;-)  Seriously, I would put statistics before programming.  Perhaps we could mix it by teaching modules inside of a spreadsheet.  You can see the mass of numbers, but the statistics formulas can help inform the students once they are taught how to interpret them.  I would find room for it by removing calculus for sure.  No HS should teach calculus instead of stats (imho).  You could probably remove a great deal of the other upper math courses to make room for stats.  Analytic geometry?  Who cares about conics when the world is full of newspaper stories with bad statistical thinking.  Here's an example of how it impacts the real world: Peter Donnelly: How juries are fooled by statistics:   Those of you in Britain will know about [...] Sally Clark, who had two babies who died suddenly. And initially, it was thought that they died of [...] ""Sudden Infant Death Syndrome."" For various reasons, she was later charged with murder. And [...] her trial, a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence that the chance of two cot deaths, innocent deaths, in a family like hers -- which was professional and non-smoking -- was one in 73 million. To cut a long story short, she was convicted at the time. Later, and fairly recently, acquitted on appeal [...]  And just to set it in context, you can imagine how awful it is for someone to have lost one child, and then two, if they're innocent, to be convicted of murdering them. To be put through the stress of the trial, convicted of murdering them -- and to spend time in a women's prison, where all the other prisoners think you killed your children -- is a really awful thing to happen to someone. And it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics horribly wrong, in two different ways.   emphasis added"

CGPGrey,20mohu,thomas_dahl,7,Mon Mar 17 20:25:24 2014 UTC,"One event doesn't affect the probability distribution of the other, but the probability of both occurring together is smaller than of them occurring separately, right? Like the chance of rolling a specific number with a die is 1/6, but rolling two specific numbers is 1/36?  Anyway, you're making the other people who are likely waiting to board a plane right now more anxious, Grey. Just say everything will be fine - for their benefit, please."
CGPGrey,20mohu,Alcuev,24,Mon Mar 17 20:02:19 2014 UTC,"You are discussing the probability of 2 events -   Event A: You listen to the podcast while on a flight  Event B: Your flight crashes  If you selected a random person on a plane, the chance that they are listening to this podcast is pretty low, let's say 1 in a million. So probability of Event A is 1/106 . Similarly, the chance that any given plane flight will crash is pretty low, let's say that's also 1 in a million, so probability of Event B is 1/106 also. Thus, the chance that a person listening to the podcast is also on a plane that crashes is about P(A)*P(B) = 1/106 * 1/106 = 1/1012 . However, you already know that you are listening to the podcast; thus the probability of you listening to it is actually 1. The conditional probability of your plane crashing, conditioned on the fact that you know you are already listening to the podcast, remains fixed at 1/106 , as Event A and Event B are independent. You listening to the podcast does not affect the chance that your plane crashes in any way. Comfort neutralized"

Base e is the most efficient base in terms of memory storage(In the manner of number of terms needed to remember vs. the number of terms needed to express a number). If we only include whole number base, it's base 3 then base 2.  My favourite base is actually balanced ternary (-0+), it is beautiful, elegant and should be every mathematician's favourite.  But senary base is more feasible for everyday use and contains a factor of three, which decimal base does not.  Senary base has a smaller multiplication table which helps with one of the early steps that make kids hate maths.  Senary base has fewer terms and thus has fewer multiplication rules to remember. In base ten, I suck at recalling multiples of seven, in base six they are as easy to remember as multiples of eleven.  Senary base makes it easier to remember primes as all primes end in 1 or 5 in base six, besides 2 & 3.  I could go on and on about the superiority of senary base."

There are no time zones in Swatch Internet Time; instead, the new time scale of Biel Meantime (BMT) is used, based on Swatch's headquarters in Biel, Switzerland and equivalent to Central European Time, West Africa Time, and UTC+1.

CGPGrey,20mohu,icoup,39,Tue Mar 18 02:04:14 2014 UTC,"Also to weigh in on the language debate, as a native cantonese and english speaker (chinese growing up in NZ) it is far more beneficial to learn a language when you are young than in high school or middle school. So if you must have 4 years of learning a language then the best period of doing so would be starting around 2 years old.  I took french for 3 years in high school and while I have no use for the language now (I should have taken Japanese instead sigh) I still retain a sense of the language to such a degree that if I wanted to I could go back and re-learn how to speak it. To be honest, as a result of my bilingual nature, the benefit that I retained from those years of learning french can be achieved from just one or two years of study.  So I agree with CGPGrey's point about language education, and that of education in general. It needs to be more streamlined and give kids more time to do the things they want to do while at the same time giving them the essential learning that they need."
CGPGrey,20mohu,xpmod,10,Tue Mar 18 02:04:51 2014 UTC,"I think that Grey didn't venture to understand the topic for the scope of non-homogeneous societies (even when he finally mentioned non-Anglophone countries, he didn't go as deep as I'd hope).   First, the non-Anglophone bit: I live in a non-Anglophone country. Contrary to the reactions he cited, I think, and everyone I know agrees (and by that I mean people who work in education and/or academics) that English must be taught as soon as possible, and it's an extremely valuable asset that it would be criminal to deny to primary school students.   Formal education starts at 6 years old here, so you can't have it earlier than that. Still, they postpone it to when students are 11, when it's already too late then. Even worse, languages other than English are introduced when students are already 16. Literally no point in that.  Now, what it really concerns me: Many societies in the world are not homogeneous. How does Gray feel about language requirement in such cases? (And wouldn't he think that this is also relevant in the US?)   In my country we currently have this discussion, on whether it's finally time for each of the two dominant ethnic groups to raise their next generation as bilingual, in each other's language. Not only for practical reasons (now the two ethnic groups live segregated and that's hurting the economy and the societal progress), but also for political reasons: supporters (I am one of them) think that mutual bilingualism is a sign of willingness to be equal. There was a war in the past, and it was about powersharing of course. Who would be the superior ethnic group and who will just follow around. Mutual Bilingualism can also be a political tool, and a great equaliser, in my opinion.   Will you guys find that a waste of time? Again, it's something that should begin in primary school. The later you introduce a foreign language the more ineffective teaching it is.   In any case, I am 100% pro teaching computer programming in schools, and I believe that time can be found by a more efficient curriculum design that still has room for foreign languages (if we need to ax something, I strongly believe that should be Bible Study in public schools. Now that's something that a public school shouldn't do)"

CGPGrey,20mohu,Pyromane_Wapusk,28,Thu Mar 20 16:27:33 2014 UTC,"Sorry in advance for the long(ish) post. Feel free to skip to the end for a TL;DR summary.  I am a guy who loves learning languages. I majored in (mandarin) Chinese, minored in Japanese, and I'm currently working on Korean. I think learning a foreign language is not only mind- and worldview-expanding, but also lots of fun. With that in mind, let me explain what I mean when I say I agree with Grey.   The way languages are taught in schools now is basically worthless. I took Latin in high school, my brother took French, and my sister took Spanish. None of us speak a word of those languages now. When I was in college, though, I took two years off to work as a volunteer with Chinese immigrants in New York. Before I left, I took a ~2 month intensive course in Chinese, and by intensive, I mean 8 hours a day, 6 days a week and very strong discouragement from using english during our free time. When I got to NY, I lived in an apartment with native Chinese speakers, worked with them day in and day out for the next two years, encountering people from all parts of China and with lots of different (and initially, to me, incomprehensible) accents. By the end of those two years, I was pretty dang good at Chinese, if I do say so myself. You'll notice I didn't mention sitting in class for an hour a day, five days per week.  The point I'm driving at is that language is not really an academic subject, like history or math, that needs to be understood intellectually, it's a skill, like piano or a sport, that has to be honed over thousands of hours of usage. The only real way to learn a language is to speak it, day in and day out, for months or years on end. It is also a skill that takes a good deal of investment before it becomes useful.   Look at it this way: if you put 30-40 kids in a classroom with one piano and one teacher for an hour a day, five days a week (if that) for four-to-six years, those kids are NOT going to learn piano. Even if the teacher is a world-famous concert pianist, and the piano is some great Steinway grand (is that a good piano? I don't really know anything about pianos), they're still not going to learn piano with the amount of time such a class can afford to spend on each individual student. They just won't. Your skill at piano is directly proportional to the amount of time you spend sitting at the keyboard playing music (or scales or exercises, but your butt is still on the bench and your fingers are still on the keys). Having a teacher explain the history of music, or music theory, or playing great pieces of music for you might help a little bit, and will certainly help you develop an appreciation of music, but it is no substitute for hours and hours of practice.  Language learning is exactly the same. It doesn't really matter how motivated the teacher is, or how good the materials are, your skill in a foreign language is directly proportional to the amount of time you spend speaking/reading/listening to/writing it. In classrooms with 30+ kids, the amount of time each individual kid spends speaking spanish (or whatever) is miniscule. The complete failure of language education at the junior high-high school level is not really surprising. In order to learn a language, you have to USE it.   This, however, leads us to another wrinkle - it takes a while to become fluent enough to hold a conversation, to say nothing of watching TV or reading a novel in your second language. Basically, until you get to that certain level (I'd say around the 300 level in college terms, or maybe 500 hours of classroom instruction - if I am remembering correctly), your language skills are completely useless. You learn lots of basic grammar and vocabulary, and set phrases for 'common' situations that really aren't, but you can't start putting it together to get the sort of language people actually speak day-to-day until you've got all those building blocks in place. Until then, you're stuck at the ""Hi how are you? I'm fine and you? I'm fine also. It is nice weather today, yes? Yes, it is nice weather today."" level. It ends up creating a sort of catch-22, where you need to practice the language to get good at it, but in order to do anything useful with the language (and therefore have some sort of enjoyable and productive practice), you need to be better at it. So basically, for the first ~500 hours of practice/instruction you're stuck with a slog through rote memorization and sample dialogues featuring childish grammar. Once you get past that, your conversation becomes interesting enough to make friends with people in your new language, or watch TV and catch at least some of what's going on, or read (simple) books (or comics - comics make good reading material for the learner who is not quite ready to tackle novels - the pictures make the narrative easier to grasp, and the language used is more real that the dialogues you get in most language textbooks), and so the practice necessary to improve becomes less torturous and more fun.   The solution, it seems to me, is that languages need to be learned intensively, at least for the first ~500 hours of instruction or so. You need to spend a couple of months doing nothing but studying and, more importantly, practicing the language, so that you get to the point where its useful. Then you can learn on your own, or take more leisurely classes, and you won't give up in frustration or tune out, because the language will already be paying off in your life in terms of new friends, new perspectives and new experiences. This model is, quite obviously, incompatible with the instruction model used in most schools - all subjects studied in parallel, with only 1-2 hours per day per subject. It would make a summer project - a change of pace, with a useful new skill at the end of it, and for people with both the desire to learn a language and the flexibility to spend a couple of months doing nothing else (or parents with the ability to force their kids to do so), this is the model that really works.  The other option is to move to the country in question. Then you will be forced to gain a certain level of fluency just for long-term survival, and those hours of rote practice become less boring homework and more desperate effort to understand what's going on around you. This won't work if you stay in an expat ghetto, though (as with those Chinese people I worked with in NY), as that takes away the force requiring you to put in the hours of effort, and learning a language goes right back to being boring homework. This is why we see such divergent results with immigrants - some people become fluent (they still have an accent, more often than not, but otherwise they get by just fine) and some never pick up English despite being in the US for 10+ years. Some of them break out of their respective immigrant ghettos, get a job where they're forced to speak English, and within a year or two, are fluent, and some get jobs that don't force them to speak it, take classes once a week in the evenings, and never get anywhere (at least in terms of learning English). Basically, if you can come up with a way (or put yourself in a situation) to force yourself to use the language, you will eventually learn it to a reasonable degree of fluency, and if you can't, the grind will get to you, and you'll never get to a point where the language is really useful.  When it comes to instruction in schools, then, I side with CGPGrey. A one year survey course, to introduce the way different languages work and open your mind to the idea that just because we say something a certain way in English, that doesn't make it the only way or a reflection of ultimate truth or something, but the 4-8 years of language study practiced in secondary schools around the world is mostly useless. I still think language instruction is valuable and would encourage anyone with an interest, but it is undeniably a lot of work to achieve a level where you can hold a conversation, to say nothing of reading Proust or Nietzsche or Confucius in the original. For most native-English-speakers, it's a lot of time and effort for not a lot of (economic) benefit. As a way of enriching your life, I would say it's absolutely worth it, but you need to be aware of the real effort required - learning a language is not a weekend project.  TL;DR summary - Learning a language is a skill that takes thousands of hours of practice, which you just can't get in a traditional classroom. People should still learn languages, but not in public school.   Also, I loved the ending of the podcast. Hilarious!"
CGPGrey,20mohu,ernesto_jimenez,4,Mon Mar 17 22:11:29 2014 UTC,"I completely agree with you, that intensively learning a language is important.   From my own experience, I am Chinese Canadian and I speak cantonese fluently and started to learn mandarin when I was 10. Cantonese and Mandarin are similar enough but there are many nuances and differences that make them almost completely different languages. Only the writing structure is the same, but I still do not write very well, can't read it either.   At first I was put through a Mandarin class (once a week for 2 hours) but that failed pretty epically. It was a big waste of time. After three years I was still only really able to speak a few words. After this I started playing sports and meeting and playing with people who only spoke mandarin. When this happened my mandarin in the space of 6 months improved so much I was able almost understand fluently what they were saying, my speaking had also improved to a stunted conversational level.   Without having practice over time for a language it is pretty impossible to learn. I have taken seven years of french (it started in elementary school) but even now I cannot even hold a conversation in French. Second languages in school are pretty useless most of the time as after the class students just revert back to english and the class is forgotten.   However, I believe second languages should be taught (just not french, probably a more useful language would be better) but it should not be restricted to just the second language class. Instead I think having a system like the French Immersion schools here, where they teach some subjects in English and other subjects in French is the most beneficial.   TL;DR Languages are important but the way they are being taught sucks."

Some countries are doing a great job with this (e.g: Finland was great when I lived there). Unfortunately some other countries like Spain are terrible. Kids in Spain have to ""learn"" english for years, going over the same basic things year after year while most of them don't learn anything.  The interesting part is that in the countries I found to be the best at this seem to be those who don't dub movies and cartoons. As an example, in Finland, kids saw Sponge Bob in TV in English with subtitles in Suomi while we dub everything in Spain.  Also, in Spain there's a big flame when some big video game doesn't (e.g: GTA) doesn't dub the video game and people need to play with Spanish subtitles.  One thing that frustrates me: finding some video on the internet that would be of great interest to somebody in Spain and not being able to share it because they don't know English nor dubbed."

After a few years of english in school I started reading a lot of english online, just because there is so much more content in english out there, than in german. Later I started watching movies in english.  The lessons were kinda a door opener, but internet and movies were what motivated me. It feels a lot more natural to learn a language by listening to native speakers, instead of a german who can hardly speak english, yet is teaching it in school.  As for the dubs: Although most german dubs are relatively well made with lip sync and everything, it is really sad that things like netflix are not aviable in my country!  I am not a language person myself and if after one year of english lessons I would have had the choice to cut out all language lessons and learn more science Instead, I probably have done just that and would not be writing this. I am happy now that I was forced to take that subject for more than one year in school. I also was forced to take a second language and chose latin. I learnt almost nothing."

I also was forced to take a second language and chose latin. I learnt almost nothing.   Fascinating. I've actually found that Latin (I was taught Latin in high school as well) greatly helped me with English and vice versa.  Most remotely advanced/difficult words in English are directly descended from Latin, so knowing Latin words helped figure out what obscure English words meant. The other way around, if I didn't know what a word meant in Latin, I would think if I knew any English words that seemed close to it, for hints about what it could mean."

I really like the dynamic it brings though.  As for the sign language, working in intellectual disabilities I would advocate Makaton as an alternative option. Many more children (and some adults) rely on this as their only or main form of communication than sign language, especially with the advances in deaf aid technology. It is much simpler to learn but would still give the option of communicating non-verbally when distance or sore throats necessitate."

One of the biggest problems, though, is that not all programs are created equal. My high school's Spanish program had awful teachers and was a joke, and my friends in it can't speak a word, but my Chinese teacher was great and I felt super prepared for my university classes. Cutting out bad versions of classes is, to me, a more important objective than turning the classes into electives."

The reason you teach a language is to allow them to access avenues of thought that were impossible before doing so. You are limited in what thoughts you can think because you can only think them in English. This is not a matter of simple translation either, it is due to the very structure and content of the language. By teaching someone another language, you have allowed an enormous number of before unthinkable thoughts to occur. Much like many other subjects, learning language is teaching someone a new way to think."

CGPGrey,20mohu,googolplexbyte,5,Tue Mar 18 21:52:43 2014 UTC,"Part of the reason that pi overshadows tau so much in popularity is the fact that the symbol has, basically, been set aside like a retired jersey number. Pi is the constant value pi, and, for the most part, is not used as a symbolic variable in equations. Tau, on the other hand, is used as the variable representations of specific tax in economics. It is also VERY common in use as the pascal measurement of shear stress on objects in physics/mechanical engineering. With that in mind, using tau as a constant standard would create confusion if something else doesn't change first. I don't find it likely that these symbols could easily change on a large scale, but I find it less likely that selecting a new symbol to represent 2(pi) could gain popularity.   Also, tau implies making radial measurements in engineering, or (again) changing by a factor of 2 in calculations off of diameter, and neither of those sound easy to implement, on a large scale, in the minds of engineers. =P  TL;DR: Pi IS a constant, trying to make Tau a constant requires removing it from equations currently using it as a variable"

I'm from Portugal and I think language classes here are very well balanced. Maybe it's difficult for students to learn a new language in a English speaking country because they don't have a real, clear motive to learn it. English is everywhere and (almost) everyone can talk and understand it. I learned English because it's very used here on the internet, if the language of the internet was Portuguese I wouldn't speak English fluently. Or maybe it's because the English language is incredibly easy compared to romantic languages like Portuguese, Spanish and French. Romantic language's grammar is terrible.  In Portugal you start learning English at the 5th grade, on the 7th grade you get a choice, you can learn Spanish or French (i took French and now i only thing i can say is ""je ne parle pas français"") so, during 3 years (7th, 8th, 9th grades) you are learning French and English at the same time, then you get to the 10th grade where you have three choices: Spanish, English or French, and so you only learn one language. then you get to 12th grade where you can choose to keep learning the same language or learn Psychology or Computer Science.

CGPGrey,20mohu,kirbcom,3,Mon Mar 17 18:39:26 2014 UTC,"I first thought you guys would ignore the ""English as a second language"" case when talking about languages. Fortunately you didn't, and I completely agree with you on that point.  A good grasp of English can completely change your life as a non-native speaker, and this is something that I guess is quite hard to appreciate as a native. Coming from a rather small european country, I can safely say that up to a third of the words I hear are in English, and 100% of my reading is done in English. Coincidentally, knowing this language is the single most important thing that helps me study computer science in college. The ammount and quality of the resources I would loose if I weren't relatively fluent in English would just be insane. The same goes for all the ideas that have shaped my worldview and principles. And this podcast too, for that matter!  As for translation... it might be a solution for splitting the bills and buying bread... But trying to read an awkward translation of an already complicated 500 page book is barely doable. This is not because of the quality of the translation. It's because of the different structues of the two languages - there are thoughts that come to me naturally in my native language that have to be modified to be even coherent in English. Certain words do not have exact correspondents so you end up having to read through a lot of ""translator's notes"" on the topic. I realise I have much stronger feelings on this topic that most people, but I cannot read translations of some books I already know and love. It's like seeing a movie vs. having it narrated to you by someone who just saw it."

CGPGrey,20mohu,momerathe,13,Wed Mar 19 14:20:54 2014 UTC,I think Grey is ignoring a major benefit of learning a language. The language you speak influences the way you think and learning another language let's see a culture through their eyes.  Also grey also made some comments about how history is not focusing enough of how history is basically the progress of technology which is really awfully wrong.   Sometimes it just seems like a STEM circle jerk sometimes.

CGPGrey,20mohu,HashPram,6,Sun Mar 30 16:48:24 2014 UTC,"From experience I think this is true for the UK, but I have friends from the US who came out of school with a good grasp of Spanish. I studied German for 5 years (4 compulsory) and loved it but could not even have had a decent conversation by the end of it. It's now 8 years later and I can't even remember 'how are you?'.  I've now been teaching myself Spanish for 4 years, and the difference between the 2 experiences is so much bigger than I would have thought. It's definitely to do with motivation and understanding why I am doing it that has changed.   In school I memorized words, speeches and essays so I could pass an exam, well aware that the next week I wouldn't remember any of it. Whereas now I have travelled in South America and plan to again, so I am motivated to find ways of learning that will enable me to actually converse with people. My Spanish is way better now than my German ever was."

CGPGrey,20mohu,AlligatorRocket,12,Mon Mar 17 17:28:35 2014 UTC,"It's funny that CGPGrey is somewhat behind on the discussion on advertising precisely because he does not know the right languages and thus doesn't register the solutions that have been worked out in continental Europe. We ""over here"" are now at a point where it's clear that:  a) Advertising will die (or rather, 90% of advertising, with the exception of sponsorship, so the Audible thing is actually a really good move.)  b) Tying 100% of your personal income to Google is a really bad idea  c) People have shown that it is possible to live off content creation on the internet without doing any advertising  The prime example is Tim Pritlove who does podcasts, almost exclusively in German (smaller audience base!), and has been generating his income from that for years now. Without advertising. To find out how he does it is left as an exercise for the language-learner. :)  As for the argumentative segment of the let's do away the years of language learning part: I have a Ph. D. in Physics. speak three languages fluently and another four so-so and have even dabbled in NLP. Based on this background, I would like to emphasize that very little of what CGPGrey said about the benefits and future of language learning makes any sense. However, I won't get into that, since, as I've learned, people tend to not read long posts.  So all in all, I really like the podcast! It's just that I must voice some disagreement regarding the perception of reality put forth by CGPGrey."
CGPGrey,20mohu,ibond1120,5,Mon Mar 17 21:52:20 2014 UTC,"I'm aware that we're out in the anecdotal here. Grey has seen some parts of the school system (lots of pupils) and I have seen a smaller part of the school system and legions of University freshmen.  There are two things I can tell you that hold universally for almost everybody I've seen:   If you can't speak English, you're ""broken goods"" jobmarket-wise. You will still find a job here in Germany, but it'll haunt you throughout your professional life. So no disagreement here. Practically everybody I ever speak to about languages has the same regret: That they didn't achieve a higher level in their second foreign language. Sure, I've met the odd person that considered learning French a waste of time, but the overwhelming majority regrets not having gained better knowledge of French.   Btw: If anybody out there is undecided on what foreign language to learn: Spanish is the easiest of the naturally developed live languages, German will probably have a more reasonable bang-for-the-buck ratio and unlike Japanese is still manageable.   Also, the point of my pseudo-humblebrag in the previous post got kind of lost between the humble and the pseudo, so I'll try to clarify (heh): Having a broad understanding of both science and languages, I can attest that both change your frame of reference of seeing the world in a positive way. It might be that the current state of school language education is producing miserable results, but once you really know a language you are rewarded with a new world.  And I don't even mean speaking or writing perfectly. The payout happens around the time when you have your first dreams in the language and you can comfortably spend an entire day speaking nothing but that language.  I'm aware that school doesn't deliver this for many (anybody?), but IMO that is what needs to be fixed.  EDIT: I forgot to reply to your point about the broad benefits of language learning. This now drifts into the political, but I've yet to meet an ardent nationalist that speaks at least one foreign language. Sure, they exist, but it has been my experience that the typical nationalist is blissfully isolated from reality by the language barrier. (Not even getting into language being used as a tool of conflict, as happens in Belgium, Ukraine and other places.)"

CGPGrey,20mohu,Chattalicious,3,Mon Mar 17 23:53:57 2014 UTC,"I'm with Grey on the language thing. I learnt French and German to GCSE level (that's ~age 16 for non-UK folks) - I even got an A in both of them. I cannot speak French of German; I doubt I could even form a grammatical sentence in either.  As an adult I learnt Japanese; the learning experience was completely different. Partly because I actually cared to learn it (see Grey's point about it remaining as an elective), but the goal and structure of the tuition was geared towards practical, vocal language acquisition, and not how to write down set phrases in examinations.   So yeah, school language lessons don't teach kids how to speak a foreign language.  (As an aside, if we think we're badly off, ESL teaching in Japanese high schools is appalling. It's common for Japanese teachers of English not to be able to speak the language themselves, which, when I found it out, was absolutely incomprehensible to me.)"

Sounds exactly how I felt about studying maths at school. In fact it sounds like most people's views of their least favourite school subject.  Can I ask Grey: Did you ever feel like you possessed any skill at foreign languages, and/or was it a subject you enjoyed at school? Is this a reaction against your own perceived inadequacies, or a subject you disliked?  Doesn't the remembering portion of learning usually involve a certain amount of rote simply because that's what it takes to remember something? And aren't most academic skills acquired at age 16 of little practical utility? Most people don't use quadratic equations at work. Does that mean no-one should learn how to do them?"

CGPGrey,202yr4,gd2shoe,99,Tue Mar 11 14:25:45 2014 UTC,I feel like Brady came into his own on this episode. He sounds less like he is interviewing Grey and more like they are friends talking. Keep it up please Brady. I like the more assertive you.
CGPGrey,202yr4,twylitesfalling,30,Tue Mar 11 15:27:58 2014 UTC,"Ditto.  I accept that Brady is always going to ask more questions, that's just his natural mode, but it is refreshing when CGP interviews Brady.  It feels more organic, and less like there are assigned roles.  Besides, we're all fascinated about the next facet of CGP's thought process that we'll see next, but we don't yet know enough about Brady's idiosyncrasies, or we're not delving deep enough when they come up.  (Now that I think about it this feels a bit voyeuristic, but we're listening because we think you're interesting people talking either about interesting topics, or about mundane topics in a non-standard light.)"
CGPGrey,202yr4,garyomario,5,Tue Mar 11 00:06:26 2014 UTC,"I agree up to a point. Grey is extremely efficient in a way that seems arguably a better way to live but that just seems foreign to me.   Brady seems like the proxy for a really solid ""everyman"" in the conversation. That's not to say that Brady doesn't have strengths and skills that raise him to his current level of success. But it feels like Grey has skills/viewpoints to which i aspire whereas Brady has skills/viewpoints to which i can relate.  edit: typo"
CGPGrey,202yr4,Kashimir1,2,Tue Mar 11 05:30:18 2014 UTC,totally agree CGP lives what seems to be a super efficient and organised life with a lot of well thought out processes but Brady is the average guy you can relate to. Plus he also asks the questions I feel most people are thinking and say what the average person would say in reply to CGP's quirky lifestyle.
CGPGrey,202yr4,quesopano,6,Thu Mar 13 16:39:58 2014 UTC,It's thanks to those damn cats.
CGPGrey,202yr4,molecularpoet,2,Thu Mar 13 23:42:04 2014 UTC,I agree. Brady has a lot of interesting views so it's nice to hear him talk about them at length more often.
CGPGrey,202yr4,Element999,28,Tue Mar 11 11:53:59 2014 UTC,"Before listening to these podcasts I used to think that Grey had a specific persona he adopted online (his videos and to an extent twitter), where he would somewhat play the role of a very practical and modern guy. With these podcasts I'm seeing that the persona of CGP Grey is much, much closer to the actual guy than I thought. I used to think Grey uses a pseudonym basically to keep up this persona and to avoid other aspects of his life clashing with this idea of a person we are getting, but now I think it's just an issue of personal privacy. I'd love more insight on the issue of anonymity in fact."
CGPGrey,202yr4,thomas_dahl,21,Thu Mar 13 16:16:25 2014 UTC,"Interesting how Grey doesn't use his own email writing guidelines for talking on the podcast.  He almost never replies to yes-or-no questions with yes or no followed by an explanation. We always first get the sigh, then the long explanation and then, in most cases, the answer. :)"

CGPGrey,202yr4,Halgy,3,Tue Mar 11 18:10:17 2014 UTC,"The wallpaper is a distraction... if I see it /at all/ I want something that has a little eye-catching value as possible.

On the physical machine(s) I work at though, the only time I see the background is when it first boots or I change projects (and close everything), which is very infrequent. Otherwise, the screen is covered in windows.

CGPGrey,202yr4,CoboltC,11,Tue Mar 11 17:55:36 2014 UTC,"Not really.  CGP doesn't want The Internet to know his name for a variety of reasons (he values his privacy, he doesn't want people stalking him, it's irrelevant to the brand he's created, it allows him to separate private and personal life).  The best way of doing that is for him to not disclose his real name - by any means necessary.  Even if you knew his real name what would that do for you? It's not going to suddenly make you his best bud, and it's not going to give you some special power over him - it's just the name of some guy whose Internet videos you watch.  Besides, we all know his name is Robert Paulson."

CGPGrey,202yr4,StegosaurusJetpack,30,Sun Mar 16 16:51:26 2014 UTC,"The way that Grey thinks is kind of insane. In every single episode (I think) Brady has said ""does part of your system x make you feel y emotion?"" and Grey just replies that his system is correct, and the best way to do it, so how could he possibly feel y emotion because of x.  For example: At about 1:09:30, Brady asks if Grey ever stresses about the prospect of emails he auto-archives being really meaningful, and Grey replies ""I don't worry about this at all, it doesn't worry me in the slightest [...] The only question is, what is the correct system [...] Your argument is crazy! My argument is correct.""  tl;dr Grey is Cray"
CGPGrey,202yr4,googolplexbyte,37,Tue Mar 11 23:28:13 2014 UTC,"Grey is Grey or Grey is Crazy?  I say Grey is practical. When you have a large regular task you need a practical system to be efficient such as processing email. Feeling good or bad about something doesn't change the fact that the email still needs to be done and time is a valuable resource.   Imagine someone walking down the street throwing handfuls of coins on the ground giving them away. There are pennies, nickles, dimes and quarters and lots of people are picking them up. You can either pick up every single coin you come across or you can just pick up the quarters and skip over the rest so you can go get more quarters.  If the goal is to get the most money you only grab quarters, but you can't worry about whether or not if one of those pennies was a rare coin worth much more than face value.   The benefits of completing his email vastly outweighs the potential for a hidden gem being found. You can't feel good or bad about doing what needs to be done."
CGPGrey,202yr4,Halgy,17,Tue Mar 11 04:02:13 2014 UTC,Preach it.
CGPGrey,202yr4,thebgland,5,Tue Mar 11 05:30:01 2014 UTC,Yes you can. That's why you're human.

CGPGrey,202yr4,Joeytje50,5,Sun Mar 16 00:24:07 2014 UTC,"I had a related observation during ""4 lightbulbs"" episode, where Grey said he just wasn't going to worry about his health for however long. Brady insisted that wasn't a good idea, which is probably right.   That said, unless one plans to make a change, guilt is completely unproductive. In such a case, it is just a coping mechanism to make one feel better about not doing something one should. If Grey had planned to shame himself into being healthier, then guilt would have been productive. However, since he went into the affair knowing he wasn't going to change, worrying about it wouldn't make him healthier and would rob him of time he could spend making videos, which was what he was trying to avoid in the first place.  I will agree that Grey is quite bit blunt about it. I have a problem with the world ""correct"" when describing personal systems. Grey's system may be more effective in some (if not most) situations, but to say it is ""correct"" is a bit strong. Probably just a semantic argument. Or maybe I'm just too close to Canada to be even that impolite."
CGPGrey,202yr4,gd2shoe,2,Tue Mar 11 20:13:53 2014 UTC,"I would take a guess and say that Grey feels the emotion y because of x but finds the emotion y useless and therefore ignores it.  This is at least very much the way I operate. I do say that I'm not afraid of the dark, but in all honesty I do feel some anxiety in dark places. However, knowing that the fear is meaningless and useless, I don't let it affect my actions at all."
CGPGrey,202yr4,ScannerBrightly,50,Tue Mar 11 21:51:22 2014 UTC,This podcast seems more like a platform for Grey to talk about first world youtuber problems.

There are some people who are interesting enough that I want to listen to their views: Brady and Grey are two of them. They are both exceptionally smart, well spoken have complementary personalities (or maybe it just seems that way because Grey is a robot). Plus, YouTubing isn't a job that I know a lot about, so it is cool to get a look behind the curtain. Even if Brady and Gray aren't sharing the secrets of life, it is still cool to get a look inside their heads.   I'd love if this podcast became analogous to Still Untitled: the Adam Savage Project (Adam is the guy from Mythbusters, FYI). They just pick a topic and go into it, albeit for 20-30 minutes rather than an hour and a half."

CGPGrey,202yr4,Marmalade6,7,Tue Mar 11 22:00:04 2014 UTC,"CGP mentioned sociology.  That is a massive field with all kinds of interesting stuff that most people don't know (including myself).  Also, I understand why you don't want to talk about upcoming videos.  I do think that this podcast has an interesting opportunity to field ideas and elicit feedback early in a video project research phase.  (maybe every third video or so, if you can handle keeping one on a public side burner while finishing other projects)  Also, more videos!  Yours are always awesome.  (We understand you take painstaking care, and thus we remain patient.  But it's still a happy day when we get a CGP anything to consume.)"
CGPGrey,202yr4,Omni314,15,Tue Mar 11 03:15:15 2014 UTC,"I think this XKCD post is quite relevant (warning: it's a long read, so you might just want to read the first sentence of the first 2 quotes first). Funny about these is that these quotes are all way before 'the age of the internet'. All these quotes can be magnified to 100 times what they were back then, I think. I especially like this one:   There was never an age in which so many people were able to write badly   Israel Zangwill, 1891    That XKCD post just really puts into perspective how fast people thought the world was going those 100 years ago, and then comparing the speed it used to go then with the speed it goes now - for example the decision to delete in 3 seconds. For most of these quotes, I am just amazed by the date placed next to it. I'd say most of these quotes could just as well be quotes from the typical grumpy grandpa  Disclaimer: To be honest, I didn't read all of those quotes, I just stumbled upon that post and found it relevant and very interesting.  PS: Also interesting is the XKCD post right after it, which seems very relevant to the 'freebooting' discussion"

CGPGrey,202yr4,_pmcp_,2,Wed Mar 12 04:04:09 2014 UTC,"Actually, this has one of two very distinct interpretations. Either: 1. Grumpy grandpas were always grumpy grandpas, and things have always been just fine, or: 2. They've always been right: in certain aspects, the world has been getting worse and worse for hundreds of years, and eventually it just don't be able to take it anymore.  It's not quite clear which of the two is the case. Think of the Malthusian catastrophe. It obviously hasn't happened yet. But are we headed there? Are we overtaxing the planet in food, environment, energy, and will run out with catastrophic implications? Judging by historical precedent, perhaps not. Moore's law hasn't broken up yet for processor speeds, or for energy production, or probably for food production, etc. . But will it not break in the future? who knows. It's possible that the grumpy grandpas were always right."

People needed two, three or four sentences just to cover the same three points. I realized later that those same people that received good English grades in high school, were the same people that could write 10 or 20 page book reports, always well beyond the minimum required. I could never do it but they learned how to repeat information in different ways and use a lot of words to say something simple.

Sociology is more subject to change, but is less likely to be wishful thinking.  Just as it's hard to disprove a negative, it's hard to disprove a theory about what's going on in someone's head.  It is much easier to disprove a prediction about the behavior of an aggregate in a given situation (assuming the situation ever comes up).  Also, when they're doing it right, they learn from each other.  These shouldn't be isolated disciplines.  In some ways, it's like the studies of particle physics and astronomy."

I've always been taught that when writing an email to someone of higher status (like a professor or a Youtube celebrity) in which I ask for something, I should start with a sentence or two about who I am and why I should presume to contact this person, and then go on to my actual question/request. Is this still the accepted thing, or is the trend moving more in the Grey direction?"
CGPGrey,202yr4,Fsmv,3,Mon Mar 10 23:34:07 2014 UTC,"As with most rules, those are both opinion.  There is no fixed right or wrong way to do it.  Having such rules is good, but only if you understand where they come from.  Then, you can apply or discard them on the fly.  For instance, if you're writing someone substantially above your station, but who probably does not receive a ton of mail, then introducing yourself upfront is probably a good idea, especially if you hope to have an ongoing dialog.  Alternatively, you could make sure your introduction of yourself is extremely well defined, such as block indenting, using a smaller font and whole-paragraph italicizing.  If your first sentence there makes clear what the block is about, then they will use no effort whatsoever to skip it and find the meat of your message.  So, both ways are right, and both ways are wrong.  Don't focus on the rule, but the reason, and you'll have success."

I realize that you both make your livings through Youtube's advertising and so you have a built-in bias, but I cannot comprehend why you'd discuss using adblock for principled reasons (to block imgur), but not even hint at the idea that self-protection is a driving motivation for many adblock users.

The beauty of the current system (the advertising networks), is that the content creator can concentrate on the content and leave the business side to people with experience in such matters.

If you don't finish a video it'd use up less and if you did it'd use up more.  The actual 'cost' of a given video would be abstracted in to the 100; for those binging on someone's series they might deplete less just to make it harder to figure out exactly what the ad would have otherwise cost.  In that way I could still support the content creators I admire, without running the above risks for ads or consumption of valuable (to me) time/resources on high-bandwidth non-quality-negotiated video ads (EG watching youtube videos on my data plan while eating lunch)."

CGPGrey,1z0vz6,mrquandary,4,Thu Feb 27 01:42:22 2014 UTC,"""code of conduct"" of sorts for online ads.    I have to say that I've always found it weird that any site agrees to host malicious advertisements, or even the deliberately misleading ones like the fake download buttons. Obviously they get the money required to run the website from those ads, but if a site is willing to mislead or even harm their users I'm not interested in any service they are providing.  While most of the time the ads come through an advertising network so that the website doesn't really know what ads will be shown there are huge differences in the maliciousness depending on the network.  I think the regulation in the end is in the hands of the content and service providers. Just as an example, CGPGrey could advertise some link to a malware filled website here on this podcast but we know he cares about his listeners way too much to do anything like that.  My personal answer to malicious advertisement is to simply avoid any site that shows it, though I know this is quite often impossible."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,Matoyak,2,Thu Feb 27 12:34:23 2014 UTC,Likewise. I didn't adblock for the longest time but when I had to remove malware I decided enough was enough.

Not to start an OS flamewar but I'd guess the situation would be different running Internet Explorer on Windows XP.   and the idea that people shouldn't have the option to protect themselves unless they can code their own adblocker is kind of head-in-the-clouds moronic, no offense.   I fully admit that my position on that isn't consistent.     I realize that you both make your livings through Youtube's advertising and so you have a built-in bias   I don't agree with the stance that we must be pro-ad biased just because we make our livings from ads.  Sure, it can bend the mind if you're not paying attention, but that's why I also spend a lot of time thinking about the nature of ads as they relate to the audience I'm fortunate to have."

Malicious ads, malware, download-links-that-aren't-actually-download-links, scripts doing things I don't wish them to, etc are so prevalent that it drove me to install Ablock Plus and NoScript. I make heavy use of the filters (YouTube, Blip, GiantBomb, Webcomics, and other places I trust have NoScript and Adblock turned off), but the user experience is so horrid and so prevalent (and not just from an annoyance aspect, but from a ""this is vandalizing things I have purchased"") that I find it shocking you haven't experienced stuff like this.

CGPGrey,1z0vz6,djiggly,2,Thu Feb 27 21:30:27 2014 UTC,"This was my exact experience with ads growing up. More than once I had to completely format my computer because I accidentally clicked on an ad and some malware was installed and then it wouldn't turn on.  So I really think they should touch on that, because that's why I think the majority of adblock users install it. They don't trust the advertisers, and rightly so.  It's kind of weird listening to ads on a podcast because it's actually not bad. It's not intrusive and it won't install malware or redirect you to a weird page with an infinite URL."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,googolplexbyte,20,Fri Mar 7 22:07:35 2014 UTC,"I don't agree with the stance that we must be pro-ad biased just because we make our livings from ads.   I may be perceiving something where there's nothing, but I don't remember a single negative comment about ads at all.  Maybe it's in your nature to speak in positive terms about everything, but the closest either of you came to criticizing ads is ""I fast-forward through ads on my Tivo,"" and ""it might be nice to live in a world without ads for a few days, like that festival in Japan.""  Towards the end of the podcast you were positively glowing about ads and their benefits to society and other such weird, hyperbolic ideas.  I can't help but think that since your livelihood is dependent on them; since the revenue they provide has freed you from a mundane teaching career; and since your largest exposure to them has been through a reputable company (youtube/google), that you have a warped idea of what they are.  At best, ads are an occasionally entertaining, largely uninformative exercise in misinformation.  Once in a great long while you'll get exposed to something new and innovative, but usually it's just brand building.  At worst, on the internet?... my mother only uses the computer for Facebook and she occasionally clicks on the ads and links sent to her by her sisters.  Every other week, I have to visit her to take searchbars off her browser; to run anti-malware software because her expensive anti-virus didn't protect her from something; to reset her homepage to what she likes, and remove the pop-up ad that 'helpfully' suggests she ""click here to remove malware from your computer"".  This isn't just inconvenient or 'annoying' stuff, this is vandalism.  And all of it, all of it-- good and bad-- is designed to produce ""uninformed, irrational consumers,"" as Noam Chomsky would say.  So when you do a podcast on advertisements, their role in bankrolling the internet, & adblockers, and you don't mention a single thing about malicious advertising, regulations (or lack thereof) or any justification for adblockers beyond the frivolous desire to 'skip the boring stuff'.... yea, I see bias.  I hope I'm not being unfair in my criticism.  I aggressively whitelist as well, and see advertising as a necessary element in funding popular entertainment, but I really feel like this stuff should've been addressed in your podcast."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,the-spb,10,Thu Feb 27 09:34:34 2014 UTC,"I would also think that ad blocking software has done a good bit to combat processor intensive ads on the internet. Or at the very least, it allowed me to combat them, as I speak only from my anecdotal experience. There was a time, especially in the mid 2000's when the web was becoming a lot more visual, when web ads would routinely slow my computer to a screeching halt. This wasn't for any lack of processing power (I was a fairly avid video game player at the time and could run just about any game at least at medium settings on my rig), but the advertisers had little incentive (or know-how) to optimize the ads to run smoothly. For me, this was the number one reason for turning to ad blocking software.  I wasn't prone to clicking through to malware. Nor did I mind the ads themselves, as I tended to largely ignore them. I'm not claiming they had no effect, just that they weren't inherently bothersome... Well, except that they were fundamentally ruining my experience of the web.  The amount of time wasted every day could reasonably be calculated in fractions of an hour. And if I was running something significant in the background, there was a real chance that the combination would crash my computer. I'm fine if an ad requires a certain amount of viewing time, like we see now on many websites, including YouTube. But advertisers were trying to do things with graphics (via Flash and various other poorly optimized plugin applications) that computers were just not able to handle at that time. It was like the internet equivalent of someone dressed in a costume, twirling a large poster above his head, who decides it would be a great idea to follow you down the street.  At some level, there is a basic etiquette that customers must demand from advertisers in whatever this social contract is that we have gotten ourselves into. But how can people realistically communicate this to advertisers? There's no 1-800 hotline to Madison Avenue that people can call. Ad blocking software enables, at a societal level, the rough expression of this etiquette line. Just like advertisers do research to figure out how attentive people may be to TV ads, they also do research into how effective internet advertising is, and at least to me, it seems like they become more prudent about the impact of their code on the end user.  I see that this has become somewhat more rant-ish than I intended. So to conclude, I do think ad blocking helped website owners put pressure on advertisers to make ads better. Of course, that's not the only reason people use ad blocking, and the freeloader problem is ever present where individual actions must be aggregated to form a communal effect. But it does seem that there are justifiable reasons to use ad blocking software both at an individual level and at an aggregate level. These must be weighed against their individual and aggregate detrimental effects, which while real and significant, I think Cthulusuppe rightly pointed out were overemphasized in the podcast at the expense of the benefits.  Don't mean to be so critical, but it did seem like the topic could do for a bit more balance. I'm hoping, though, that this doesn't lead the podcast to become overly structured (that's what YouTube videos are for). The high minded, but conversational tone has quickly made it a regular part of my podcast rotation.  Edit: Oh, and, to give ""infringement"" that extra emotional emphasis, you can call it ""misappropriation."" Technically, they are not fully synonymous. A more literal translation of ""infringement"" is ""misappropriation of copyrighted material,"" and even then there are distinctions to be made. But so long as you don't find yourself making a nuanced argument to a judge any time soon, its close enough, and you aren't spreading misinformation. Misappropriation is from common law, so I'm guessing its safe to use it in the UK as well."

If you look into hindsight bias, for example, you will see that test subjects, no matter how much they were told about it and told to correct for it, still failed completely.

I actually do not mind ads at all they're just a part of life, but it was one incredibly abusive ad that finally forced me to get ad block. This ad was set at max volume which was about 10x louder than the youtube video I watched. It was a youtube ad but am not sure if it's revenue went to the youtuber or to youtube as it was located in the middle of the suggested videos, usually down the bottom so I had to scroll to find it. It would auto play and then re-auto play after 10 or so minutes. At the time I used to use headphone so this ad made browsing youtube an extremely stressful and occasional painful situation so in the end I got ad block.   The first 5 seconds of the video was an electric guitar/loud music. I remember that much though of course I never got further into it than that."

CGPGrey,1z0vz6,DrPigFarmer,30,Tue Mar 4 14:16:21 2014 UTC,"I think Grey's view of imgur is a little warped. It's unarguable that some people will use it to host images from things like webcomics but there's a few things to take into account. Reddit prefers direct image linking for a lot of reasons, and directly linking to a comic (like this for instance) doesn't actually benefit the comic's creator. It leads to a page with no advertisement and just costs them bandwidth. Linking to an imgur copy of the same image also doesn't pay imgur unless you leave off the file extension, but it does alleviate the bandwidth cost from the creator.  It's also considered very bad form to not provide sources when linking to imgur mirrors of things like that, at least in the civilized corners of the internet. The thought goes that anyone actually interested in the comic or it's creator can follow the source link, and the looky loos can be exposed without costing the creator an arm and a leg in bandwidth. I can't imagine the imgur folks are making a ton of money anyways.  Then there's the idea that imgur is ""predicated"" on this kind of infringement which is patently untrue. The vast majority of images posted to the site are either not directly infringing or they're so transformative as to land in questionable territory. If you go to the imgur home page you can see the most recently posted/popular images and at the time of writing I see one link that looks like it could be from a webcomic of the several hundred that are visible.   Overall I think the site does a lot more good than it does harm and it would be worth taking a second look at your opinion Grey."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,TewsMtl,9,Thu Feb 27 11:49:11 2014 UTC,"This is my view exactly. Reddit links directly to images because they play nicely with RES and hoverzoom. The only advantage to linking to the original image rather than an imgur mirror is the content creator knows how many times a page has been accessed, as they do not get add revenue. The same applies to imgur: their sacrifice is that much of their bandwidth is used up with image services that don't view their adds.   That said, your (Grey's) point about imgur being a hotspot for copyrighted content is still valid."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,rafasc,6,Thu Feb 27 19:20:03 2014 UTC,"My own usage of imgur is strictly for hosting my own images - I don't contribute to using the gallery or subscribe to any subreddits where imgur images are commonly posted.  It does get me very mad that people will repost comics though. I've seen cases where they've gone through the trouble to remove the original watermark, which prevented people from knowing who the real creator was. And these images would have hundreds if not thousands of upvotes.  It disgusts me how open imgur is to such broad and malevolent infringement, but at the same time, it's not really possible for them to police it either. Perhaps it should be the responsibility of redditors to call out users who try to take credit for things they didn't make?"
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,amphicoelias,3,Thu Mar 13 02:03:09 2014 UTC,"There's a similar issue with Tumblr in those regards. The number of times I've seen comics reposted on Tumblr with the watermarks removed is rather sickening. Even worse is when the artist originally posts it on Tumblr with their name and a link in the description, but the attribution is deliberately removed by people reposting it.  As for Imgur, while I use it, I typically use it solely for original pictures or the occasional transformative work (i.e. demotivators, when the app that creates the demotivators uses Imgur by default). Whenever I come across a comic reposted through Imgur while browsing Reddit, I make a point to look in the comments for the original source and visit their site. If the source isn't there, I do my best to track down the source and post it.   I also know that certain subreddits don't take kindly to Imgur comics (/r/comics or /r/webcomics, for instance), and the users will often call out whoever posted it for this, although more often than not it'll be the original creator who rehosted their work on Imgur to cut back on traffic and avoid the Reddit Hug of Death."

I disagree, lets see if I can explain this properly.   For quite a while the default revenue source for any website not directly selling something, was and is advertising. That in of it self is not bad but more and more adds began intruding. If you have an ad at the top of your page, then why not a second at the bottom? How about another along the side. Maybe one in the middle. I've quadrupled my income with no additional content or effort.  Now the goal of website is not content, but of displaying ads. A one page article is broken up into 5 pages with each page full of adds. Top ten lists of anything (top 10 carrots, why not?) so users would click through 10 pages of ads. (Carrot Top is number 4)   Ads pay more for click through rates so ads went from information to deception. Instead of an Ad clearly being an ad (headphones for sale) they became disguised as download buttons or other common buttons all in an attempt to trick users into clicking them. Your computer is infected, click here to fix your computer.   Ads were making website crappier and the internet less safe. This is why Ad blocking software was created. To combat the abuse of excessive ads on websites. Now that Ad blocking software is becoming more popular and affecting the bottom line, website owners are taking notice and rethinking how they make their income.  Now this is my point of how Ad blocking software is good for the internet. Since users are fighting back against excessive ads, content creators are coming up with alternative revenue streams and using quality content to support those alternatives. Quality websites that users will want to return to so they might buy a t-shirt or a hat. Honest videos from people we can connect to so a sponsored referral will carry more weight and influence. Content with value that people are willing to give directly to support their efforts like Subbable allows.   Of course none of these examples are going to replace Ads overnight but it's a step in the right direction to a better internet. Ads will always be on the internet, but only when they fall into the background and become second to the content we are there to see will Ad Blocking become unnecessary."

CGPGrey,1z0vz6,JohnStrangerGalt,10,Thu Feb 27 10:10:47 2014 UTC,"Hey Grey,  I'm the sort of guy that doesn't comment on the internet such as Youtube and Reddit, and I'm also the sort of guy that doesn't listen to podcasts. Interestingly enough, your podcasts have compelled me to create a Reddit account simply because this podcast thing you're doing is so terribly interesting. I'm a bit late to the discussion, but hopefully you'll glance this through.  My biggest frustration with internet ads is how creepy they can be. I think a lot of people like myself don’t like ads on the internet because of all of the inappropriate tracking capabilities that they have that we have little control over. For example, while someone watches TV there might be strategically aimed adds for sports equipment while watching a sports game or an ultra-macho action hero toy commercial while watching cartoons who’s main demographic are little boys that like ultra-macho action heroes. Google has quickly become the internet’s most profitable advertising company because of it’s shameless personal data harvesting. Do a quick Google search for the latest ultra-macho action hero, and you’ll start seeing it show up on random web pages that use Google ad services. It gets even more intrusive with Facebook advertising, where your profile is scoured for bits of personal information to figure out what products should be thrusted onto your vision.  I certainly understand that advertising is important, but there is a particular sort of tact that I believe is missing in Google and Facebook ads. I use ad blocking software for this reason. I’m aware there are ways of dealing with ad tracking, but none of it is ever watertight. Facebook will still sell your personal information regardless if I’m running in privacy mode with no cookies. I wouldn’t put it past Google to associate my searches with my account that I leave signed in on my computer for YouTube, Gmail, etc. again leaving cookie managing behind as an inadequate solution. It bothers me that my personal data is still being collected and abused. Though  ad blocking software is just as effective as pretending creepy men staring through your bedroom window taking notes about your personal life just aren’t there, at least it’s somewhat comforting.  All advertising isn’t bad though. As I mentioned before, I think television ads aren’t even remotely intrusive. In fact, I might even say there is a bit of elegance or art involved in trying to target ads to the best of an advertiser’s ability without knowing every little detail about every member of their audience. However, if I had to pick a favorite advertising distributor, without question I would have to choose Apple.  Before I begin with this point of my argument, I think its only fair to be entirely transparent. Apple’s advertising strategy isn’t the only Apple thing I like.. I listened to the podcast that I downloaded from iTunes to my iPhone whist signing up for a Reddit account on my iPad before coming home to type this argument on my iMac. iMight be a tiny bit bias . To go along with my electronic device preference, just like every other Apple device user, I have reason for my opinion. Apple is known for having tasteful design, even beyond the beautiful pieces of hardware the company outputs. The App Store on iOS devices is an industry leading software distribution platform due to the incredible availability of powerful, free applications that tremendously enhance the user experience. Making a free app for iOS costs a developer one hundred dollars a year minimum just to have the ability to submit apps to the App Store, and if you want someone else to do the dirty work and code for you, there is additional cost in hiring programers. Without any other revenue streams, free apps will always have ads in order to recoup those costs.  Apple’s advertising distribution service known as iAd does this painlessly for the user, developer and advertiser. The guidelines that Apple puts in place limit what the ad can do, what information it can access, how much of the screen can be taken up before it’s clicked on and more, creating a pleasant user experience while using free apps. I am not a developer or programmer, but my understanding is that to use iAds, developers essentially just have to drag and drop pre-built bits of code; simple as that. Advertisers still have access to enough information to know their ads are being somewhat directed to an appropriate demographic, but no personal information is exchanged. Also, the sheer amount of free apps available give advertisers enough of a pool to draw from to still generate revenue. From my perspective at least, it seems like a win-win.  iBeacon technology is something Apple and advertisers are developing for a new way of enhancing the increasingly important ad distributing experience. To touch on this briefly, iBeacons are a Bluetooth related technology that can pinpoint a user’s device in three dimensions, and is accurate enough to potentially display a shoe advertisement for example while walking past a shoe display window at the mall. The advertisement that is displayed might seem creepy to some people maybe, but in reality no personal information is exchanged. Location data is submitted anonymously, meaning nothing distinguishes your iPhone as any different than Tim Cook’s; it’s simply a device near an iBeacon.   I’ve typed a whole lot here, but the point I am trying to make is that I think there is a different problem besides people using ad blocking software. Your point about not wanting to give the image website revenue is valid, absolutely, however I think the root reason that people want to block ads is because they are annoying. I’m sure there are ways of blocking ads on iOS devices by jailbreaking them and then preventing applications from communicating with iAd servers, but honestly even if the choice was just a switch in settings I don’t imagine I would be bothered to turn ads off, especially at the expense of the thousands of free apps.  There are elegant ways of advertising, as demonstrated by Apple and television ads. I believe the problem with current internet advertising isn’t that there are ads, but just that the current ads are too personal and too aggressive. Ad block software exists simply to stop prying internet advertisers from getting too friendly.  Thank you for your time in reading all of this, and I sincerely enjoy the content you create.   David  PS- Ironically, I hit the fifteen second skip button a few times near the beginning of the podcast to skip past the ad. The other four podcasts I didn’t bother skipping and listened through."

CGPGrey,1z0vz6,Ralph90009,2,Thu Feb 27 14:24:37 2014 UTC,"iMight     I hope that was deliberate :D    I'd have a read-up on DAI (dynamic ad insertion), re-targeted and trackable ads on your TV, which is pretty much over the horizon...    On tracking behaviour  Tracking is a natural part of advertising nearly all ad formats (Banner Ads, iADs, Mobile Takeovers etc) generally drop cookies to track your behaviour. Saying one specific type of 'ad' is less or more intrusive than another isn't really looking at the whole picture. It's a bit more complex, but basically all these cookies get wrapped up together into a 'cookie pool' this is used to build more accurate behavioural and demographic profiles about the user visiting the site, the advertising ecosystem is trying to build up a better and better pictures of you all the time.  I know this might sound pretty creepy, and it can be when the same ad for cold medication follows you round the internet. However in my experience these cookie pools generally don't contain any actual identifiable information, data-protection is pretty robust when it comes to third-parties sharing identifiable information about you. Cookie pools tend to try to build up more generic information about you, your age, salary band, marital status, propensity to buy certain products, essentially trying to drop you in a group by making generic assumptions about you.  Most ad sellers don't deal in personally identifiable information, as an individual you are pretty useless to advertisers the cost of targeting you as an individual would be monumental. What they want is to do is hit the largest possible demographic with the most successful messages, the bigger the groups the better.  From a user's perspective this of course should be optional, and not all advertisers are completely ethical in this space. Most large corporations work with bodies like the IAB and AdChoices : http://www.youradchoices.com which promote appropriate use of targeting, tracking and promotes user choice.   I think ad-blockers exist because of the type of advertising that upsets a users experience, advertising bodies have strict guidelines around how to implement ads including many rules i.e: no more than 5 seconds of animation, no expandable or pop-over until user interaction, no audio until user interaction. These make advertising part of the window dressing of the internet, much like outdoor billboards, as apposed to sandwich boards manned by psychos chasing you down the street, screaming ""Look at me!"".  Like many things, the actions of a few spoil it for everyone.  P.S - Apple iAds has one of the most sophisticated re-targeting engines, also they essentially allow you to segment based on the collated mobile behaviour of a user. Essentially Apple is 'sort of' selling your data to the highest bidder, but it's not identifiable and the data they hold on you is for the most part irrelevant, but it might just make you tap that ad.

If I watch one of CGP Grey's videos with an ad blocker enabled, no ad is shown, so no revenue stream for /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels[1]  ? Correct?   Yes.   But that same viewing counts towards the total view count?   Not necessarily. YT view count is a calculated number. For instance, if you watch only a very small portion of the video your click might not count as a (full) view, even if you saw the banner ad.   Which doesn't affect the payout from YouTube?   Yes. Payout is not based on view count. They are losely related for videos with many views, but if you have a small channel, you can see that they can differ for a given video significantly.   Does clicking through on an ad provide a higher return for the content creator than just watching the ad?   That's highly specific. For banner ads, usually not. For pre-roll ads that are advertising a web service to which you register, a click on the pre-roll and a subsequent register does impact the money you get. But also not in all the cases. It's determined on a case by case basis by the advertiser.   Moreover, for the podcast, if I visit squarespace.com/hellointernet or audible.com/hellointernet, but don't sign up for an account, how does that affect the success rate of the show?   If the podcast doesn't generate a huge amount of hits to audible based of these referals, I doubt GREY get's any money.

CGPGrey,1z0vz6,Chmis,3,Fri Feb 28 05:51:06 2014 UTC,"Indesputable eh? Them's fightin' words.  I will use the spelling 'advertize' throughout this post intentionally as a more appropriate phonetic spelling of the word. Even the English pronounce it with a 'z'.  For the record, I grew up in a home which paid its bills through marketing design. My childhood bathroom reading was Print Magazine. I still have family who rely on it to feed themselves. I begrudge very few people in the industry for simply pursuing a living in a system which incentivizes them to do so in this way.  Whether the internet is a better place because of advertizing is highly disputable. Let us split things up a bit so that we can tackle the less controversial bits first.  The actual advertizing which people are subjected to, independent of any secondary good people might be getting from it, is overwhelmingly undesireable.  A primary intention of advertising is to draw attention to itself and away from whatever is adjacent. This distraction detracts from the value of the adjacent thing. Grey, you should sympathize with this as someone who wishes to reduce clutter in your life as being tiny mental distractions which require consideration, nomatter how brief or subconscious, which reduce your attention on your preferred tasks. Only the most skillful advertizing is simultaneously effective and discreet and that is a very rare thing. The presence of advertizing on a web page or blocking part of a video until you can click it off or mentally framing the beginning and/or end of a piece or interrupting the middle of a piece is almost always at the detriment to that piece's value. When given the opportunity to easily bypass advertizing, people will, as is evidenced by advertizing skipping on DVRs.  Advertizing encourages people to make poor consumer choices which harm people, their communities, and the planet. While there are some products which are advertized which would be great if people used them, the vast majority of advertizing tries to sell products at higher prices, not by improving the utility value of those products, but by selling people stories about how happy consuming those products will make them. Like anyone selling a good feeling, it's important to keep them coming back for more, so building obsolescence into your product will allow you to re-sell the story over and over again; just look at how successful Apple has been at re-selling its story for tremendous profit. Consumers spending more money to buy less-durable goods with less utility value is the antithesis of an efficient market and entrenches a mentality of disposable consumption which is chewing through the Earth's resources at an ever-increasing rate.  The marketing and advertizing industry consumes a disproportionate amount of our creative ability. The US advertising industry regularly pulls in many times the revenue of the US film industry. This money draws a huge proportion of our creative talent from creating culuturally enriching art to producing disposable pitches to increase sales. Advertizing is utilizing many of our best creative minds to create cultural artifacts without lasting value.  Media industries based on ad revenue are shaped by this economic driver. Ad-driven television has long been in the business of selling eyes watching ads with the programming designed to maximize the ad-watching audience; the overwhelming result is programming which is best watched in short bursts with low attention requirements and which avoids all controversy with advertisers. This goes as far as influencing news rooms (particularly local news) to avoid stories with anti-consumerist and anti-corporate messages, instead focusing on stories which stimulate short-term visceral attention to keep people interested across the advertizing break. On the internet, we get arbitrarily numbered lists distributed across several pages in order to increase the number of advertizing impressions and 'news' from the same sources which provide canned stories to local television stations and we get educational video makers who are wary about releasing videos more than about the length of a segment of ad-sponsored television shows. Compare this to for-pay or self-funded (e.g. donations or grants) models where we get long-form journalism and serial, long-form fiction.  Advertizing indisputably makes the internet better? It means there are services with a low out-of-pocket cost to utilize, but by my accounting advertizing encourages an overabundance of wasteful distractions surrounded by content which diminishes even that, all with the aim of selling people more, worse, overpriced stuff at the expense of occupying much of our most creative artistic and persuasive talent. There will always be a variety of anecdotes of good advertizing supporting good products, but I have yet to be convinced by these exceptional cases."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,DrPigFarmer,3,Fri Feb 28 17:06:57 2014 UTC,"Consider this to be an aggregate comment from thoughts I planned to comment on #4, and what I hear on #5. First, We do NOT need more emotive language, particularly for something as touchy and nuanced as the issue of copyright infringement. For small producers like you two, this is a big issue, and it is slimy for people to infringe upon that content. They do deserve to be not only to have the content taken down, but they do deserve criminal charges. The reason I say this is that small time content creators, whatever the medium, often make their content very available, they interface with their community, and they provide new creative works. People then come along and take that content in an effort to make themselves more popular, and therefore are taking the content for their own gain. On those people, I am completely with you. However, let's look at other media, where large corporations strictly control content that they did not create, but merely bought the rights to. Imagine, given this audience, that after the current season ends, Viacom bought the rights to Sherlock from the BBC. They then cancel the show, because it wasn't making the money they wanted, took down all places where it was hosted online, and wouldn't release DVDs. It is, under the same law, the exact same crime for you to download and watch a show you love for your own use, as it is for that jerk from earlier to take your content (even more so, now I think of it, because statistically Viacom is more likely to prosecute than you are). Emotive language, when there is an issue like that, with that much nuance, kills the conversation of fixing the law. If you want emotive language, then talk to your legislators about fixing international copyright law. Also a point I forget to add this. If you think that the above Sherlock example is something that would never happen, look up this same issue in the Video Game side of the Entertainment Industry. Look up things like Metal Arms: Glitch in the System, off the top of my head, and the same thing very nearly happened to Half Life, and had Valve never gotten it back, it would now be owned by Activision, and would likely be remade as a CoD spinoff.   On the subject of Adblock... I am shocked to find that you use it, Grey. You can rationalize the issue away, but it's... incongruous for you, who make your living on ad revenue, to utilize adblock, especially given that you appear to intellectually know that using that service is bad for the internet. I speak on this front from the perspective of someone who has been exploring making a living from advertisement. The reason I won't use things like youtube, or advertise on a website, is because of adblock. That's not to say that I won't make any money, and soon I will be utilizing youtube as a part of my platform to launch what I am working on, but it is the reason why I don't see how anyone can turn it into a viable option, especially when the numbers on adblock can be very variable, and are often website dependent, showing that people do know how to use a blacklist, but they are often indiscriminate about what sites they put on their blacklist, with a heavy bias toward sites that have more ads so they can pay down high server costs. I know that by refusing to use adblock, though I am occasionally tempted, I am giving youtube channels, websites, and games that I like, and even that I don't, a valid impression, which if nothing else will add to their CPM numbers, and sometimes, if I click through while trying to skip, maybe that'll register as a click. Next, I don't agree with the analogy of skipping commercials on television, and I frankly think it's kind of a weak one. Firstly, advertisers pay according to demographic ratings, for the people sitting on their butt in front of the television. Just like on the internet, demographic surveys put an estimated CPM price on television ads. The people recording at home, while they do record the commercials, are a price that they (The networks) actually have to pay. This is because time-shifting for personal use (recording via VCR, DVR, or other) does not infringe upon copyright. It's an entirely different value proposition for up to 30% (or more) of your audience to simply be able to not just skip over the ads, but bypass them completely. The logical equivalent would not be to merely skip the commercials on playback, but in real time as well. As awful as television is (I don't watch it, and as such would opt out of any demographic studies), its programs are largely paid for via advertising. A final example is Google. Google not only runs youtube, blogger, their search engine, gmail, and on and on, for free, but in the cases of sites like youtube, blogger, and relevant to me, the google play store, they actually pay you if you host ads. They do this because to Google, every single service they offer is nothing more than garnish. This is why they do things like releasing the Android kernel, SDK, and allow you to unlock android phones for developer use for free. They need not do that, they could behave instead like Apple and Microsoft, where every time you turn around you need to pay them more. Microsoft charges $100+ for office, Google gives you Google Docs (Drive) for free. When I had a Windows phone, I had to pay them $90 to even be able to develop code for it, and it at that point was so poorly built and documented that it wound up being a waste of my time and money. All you need to do to develop code for your android device is perform the ""handshake"", which they tell you how to do on their developer site, and it costs as much as a physical handshake. They can do this because of their ad money, which they get from every site running adsense and adwords, and every app running admob, whether you like the site or not. So in summation, ads are what the internet is built upon.  tl;dr... Post your best ""Didn't Read lol"" gifs."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,Lestlake,3,Sun Mar 2 07:48:23 2014 UTC,"On the podcast:  I love this podcast!  Thank you.  Things are still (clearly) in the developing phase.  You haven't yet figured out just what flavor to be.  Don't sweat it too much.  You'll probably have the best luck as a variety show with a few favored go-to topics.  I like the way the show starts as a conversation snippet without context, followed by a short intro piece.  It feels like walking into a room where an interesting conversation is taking place.  (I'd lengthen the music to 5-10 seconds, but that's me).    By way of contrast, the end of the podcast just disappears.  It doesn't have a feeling of finality and closure.  I'd put something musical there too and fade to silence, or retard to the fine, and end on a clean cadence, or something.  (or some other auditory flair that lends finality)  Frankly, after the experimental phase is over, I'd be happy if either of you (or both) continued in this podcast, or started another.  The two of you together are definitely an interesting flavor, but I think either of you could pull off a podcast and keep it interesting.  (though it probably is easier with a co-host)  CGPs voice is particularly good for recording, and Brady's accent is charming.  By way of contrast, I am a podcast fan of the Armstrong and Getty Show.  This is an over-the-air radio program for California.  I know that you don't want to emulate other shows, but it makes a good example of something that works.  They also do variety, with a few go-to topics.  In their case, they use the news, politics, and societal change.    They'll cover just about any topic, but that way, they always have something to talk about.  Whatever you settle on, choose several things that evolve over time to draw topics from.  That's what I would recommend.  *(edit: stupid spelling error)"

CGPGrey,1z0vz6,Puttanesca621,3,Thu Mar 6 18:33:04 2014 UTC,"Ad-Blocking, to me, is about clarity and safety.  Clarity - There is nothing so distracting as trying to read something only to have a giant, full window ad pop up that you then have to figure out how to dismiss. And no, it's not always an X in the upper right corner. Or as you scroll through an article there is a flashing, dancing, neon ""something"" in the side bar telling you about this one neat trick that Obama doesn't want you to know about. This all takes away from my ability to consume your content. And further, if the ads create enough of a barrier to that consumption I'll go elsewhere. As a content producer the onus is on you, when possible, to inspect the types of ads that will appear on your site. I know that in the case of YouTube videos this isn't exactly in your control. But a website author has some control. They can just subscribe to an ad network and collect the checks, or they can find something that isn't annoying or won't cause their users to leave the site entirely.  Safety - Website advertising has been, and will continue to be, a vector for the introduction of unwanted software. I have AdBlock Plus on my parent's computer because it saves me time and aggravation. It significantly lessens the possibility that they will click YES to something they shouldn't. Further, I've experienced background installed adware that was traced back to a site's advertising. So I take the same approach to advertising that I do with my corporate firewalls - block everything. Then wait for things to break, and then open it up only enough to make the thing work again.  These are areas where content producers can become part of the solution. Subscribe only to ad networks that pledge to be safe and non-intrusive. If you get reports that ads on your site are causing problems, hold the ad network accountable. Make it easy for visitors to report bad ads to you. Yes, it's more work for the content producers. But once you decide that putting ad-supported content on the web is your job, managing the advertising should be part of that job. If you don't have time for it, then maybe this job isn't for you."

His idiosyncrasies are hilarious.  He seems more real or more real a person now that I heard these podcasts.  On topic, I stopped adblocking.  So many of my favorite youtubers monetize their channels now, many whose income comes solely from their video content.  So now I let the entire ad play out, I don't even bother to skip ads."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,mauhcs,2,Fri May 2 01:33:36 2014 UTC,"I feel content piracy and content infringement/freebooting are different. They are similar in the way that they are not direct theft; the original creators do not lose their content, it is 'copied' somewhere else and they lose 'potential' revenue.  However, for things like video games or tv shows, the person viewing the pirated content knows who the creator is; and there's the possibility of future support to the original creator due to them liking the content. Youtube/image freebooting is different in that when the freebooter does not credit the original creator, it is often not obvious to the viewer and the viewer will credit the freebooter for the content rather than the original creator.  The biggest example I have of this are sites such as funnyjunk copying content and then putting their own watermark on it and profitting from it. That should be regulated. I still think we are missing the right term for what this is.  Edit:  On adblocking:  You should refer to the video game streaming community for thoughts on adblock, there are some great discussions going on within the community. The most accepted view nowadays is that it's ok if you run adblock, just do not advertise adblock in the stream chat.  On television advertisement:  Currently for the 1 hour block shows, the show itself runs about 42 minutes with ads taking up 18 minutes of the block. That is unacceptable to me, this amount of ad time and this many ad breaks forces writers to follow formulaic rules in order for there to be distinctive breaks where commercials can occur. Refering back to the stream community, they usually run a 3 minute block of commercials every 30 minutes to 1 hour and I find that much more acceptable and I whitelist almost all streamers I watch except for those that spam commercials every 10 minutes."

CGPGrey,1z0vz6,Gumbatei,2,Wed Feb 26 23:54:01 2014 UTC,I’m enjoying the podcast very much. I hope you make it to 10 if not beyond.  Freebooting does not seem quite right. The free part does seem a little soft when followed by booting.  There are some interesting synonyms for freebooting including Plagiarism that was mentioned in the comments for the last podcast. I very much like the word but it seems to be missing that you are depriving the original creator(s) of the material their rightful earnings or recognition. To address that deficiency I would like to suggest a new word derived from plagiarism (lots of irony).  Pay•gia•rism  The act of hosting content for your own benefit where a mechanism or service exists for that content to be displayed in a manner that would allow the original creator of the content to rightfully receive said benefit. Benefits commonly sought by paygiarists are profit or recognition for the creation of the work.

CGPGrey,1z0vz6,tangerineskickass,2,Thu Feb 27 10:07:17 2014 UTC,"I understand where you are coming from on the whole imgur profits off of stolen content, there is no denying that.   What about the content built upon copyrighted works? A relatively  copyright free zone like imgur shows how creative users can be when it comes to remixing and reimagining others works.  For example: A user uploaded this: http://i.imgur.com/H0gZiGG.jpg The individual images are copyrighted. But then someone took that image and created this one: http://i.imgur.com/G2iyme8.jpg and from there it was edited into this: http://i.imgur.com/UF6JSqL.jpg .(this example used images uploaded to imgur from the reddit community, not purely the imgur community)  A few simple edits of a copyrighted work yielded what I would consider a better end product. This would not be possible if it wasn't for the nature of the internet and copyright free spaces.  But since a majority of the content on those types of sites are not, ""remixes and reimaginings"" but blatant copyright infringement I agree that they shouldn't profit off other peoples work.   That being said, I do upload my own photography to imgur, since my own webhosting isn't up to the task of a few hundred thousand hits if i front page."

CGPGrey,1z0vz6,jaudette,2,Thu Feb 27 15:34:54 2014 UTC,"In reply to what Brady was saying about fast forwarding through commercials, I have no problem with that. People today are too busy to sit and watch 15-20 mins of adverts per hours as well as the 40-45 mins of the actual show (for an hour long slot) I'd prefer they scrapped these intermissions and just used ""product placement"". It's an ugly phrase but so long as it's not ""Oh look my new <insert product name> is so fantastic, it's much better than my old <insert competitor product name>"" I don't mind every car in a movie being a Ford or Aston Martin, or every drink a Lucozade or Coca Cola so long as I don't have to wait to watch what I'm actually there to watch.   A few modern shows have done something similar to what I mean. For example, NCIS:LA always use Microsoft Windows 8 Surface tablet PCs for their computers, Hawaii Five-0 always drive around in Chevrolets and they actually mention these companies in the end credits. I'm sure there are others out there, these are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head.  This is great advertising for these companies as people can actually see the products in use, hear the engine (for cars anyway) and get a sense of how they are meant to be used and the capabilites.   The only downside to this kind of advertising is that commercial broadcast companies, such as BSkyB, Channel 4 and ITV wouldn't get any income. It would work fine for Discovery who air mostly their own content and BBC who is paid for by the TV licence fees.  Anyone else thought this might be the way forward?"
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,yoyojedi,2,Thu Feb 27 16:01:13 2014 UTC,"I think the reason people use ad blocking software is the same why people pirate games.

But when some players, especially ones on tv channel sites want me to watch 3 minutes of ad for every 10 minutes of low resolution show, that's not going to happen.  And I believe many people behave similarly when they download a game. They'd gladly give 10 bucks to original creator, but not 60 to the distributor who'll take all of it."

Firstly you start talking about tragedy of the commons in relation to Adblock, and then you say you don't want these companies to exist. What is ironic is the fact you own Adblock, which contributes to the tragedy of the commons you mentioned earlier. The reason these companies exist is because of the demand. Where there is suitable demand, due to the tragedy of the commons you mentioned, there will be supply. That is the reason why there is a discrepancy between you wanting the companies to not exist and blaming them, while still owning their product."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,nikislash,2,Thu Feb 27 23:13:58 2014 UTC,"So basically, if we want to torture C.G.P. Grey, we send him physical Imgur Merchandise (which totally exists). ;p  To be honest, ads don't bother me that much.  I don't use anything like adblock, mostly because I haven't been bothered enough to seek it out and install it.  I think the only times I have ever been annoyed by ads is either when the ad itself is obnoxious or if I've seen the ad too many times.  This gets especially hard if I decided to marathon something on sites like Hulu, or The Escapist, or CrunchyRoll (which can get really bad: I've had the same commercial appear twice in a row!).  But then again, the ad is over within 15-60 seconds and I'm back to my content and I've forgotten that I'm even annoyed.  Maybe it's because I'm an American, but advertising has become a kind of white noise, something that I hear, but don't listen to, unless the ad is new or interesting.  If an ad comes on that I've seen before, I'll tune out, think about something else.  Essentially, I made the general decision that I'm willing to wait out repetitive ads for the content that I really want.  Now granted, many of these ads that play on the internet often give me the chance to provide feedback about my reaction to it (Hulu does this, especially), which I think is good.  If I can influence which ads I see, then I can put up with them.  In particular, there have been a handful of ""sultry"" MMORPGs that get displayed in Google Ads lately, and I mute those things as soon as I can, because I have no interest in even seeing the advertisements for such garbage, and hopefully, they'll get the message.  Of course, on the flip side, it helps if the ads are well down or genuine in some manner.  The ads in these podcasts are particularly reasonable as they always have some kind of personal touch or element to them.  As you've said before, you won't try and pitch anything you yourself don't use or enjoy, but I think the idea of going the extra mile of explaining why you enjoy them can only help those ads be more effective (not that I've started an audible account or anything).  Another great and recent example was the one at the end of the Taken Cinema Sins video, which was very entertaining.  It may not convince me to buy the product, but I'm much more willing to tolerate such ads when so much effort has been put into them to make them fun, or personal, or entertaining.  Anyways, keep up the great work guys.  I need to go to bed now."

Probably recognizing that the city has different areas and attempt a sector measure could fit the gap.  The masks in Japan have have dual purpose, Grey and White-Morgan-Freeman were both right.

You mentioned that you guys might talk about the news at some point, and I think the discussion on advertising is highly relevant. News organizations and other journalistic sites (e.g. magazines like the Atlantic) are struggling to figure out the revenue side of the equation that pays for the expense of news gathering and content creation. As readers shift online, these organizations have realized that they aren't making the same revenue from advertising (""trading analogue dollars for digital dimes""), and have to make up the difference in other ways.  One growing solution is sponsor-generated content, where an advertiser writes the content, or pays for the staff to write content that supports their marketing goals. This sort of solves the problem of readers knowing not to even look at the banner ads at the top and right edge of the screen (or using ad blocking software), but it can be dangerous in terms of undermining the publisher's credibility and independence. The Atlantic messed this up by running sponsored content from the Church of Scientology, which their journalists had been investigating for some time.  Many journalism outfits have also cut the expense of news-gathering, by producing more low effort, click-bait content and less in-depth, well researched pieces.  In a macro view, this trend is really bad for journalism, but there aren't many other glimmers of hope for paying for the expense of journalism. As long as these are for-profit enterprises, the demands for revenue will have a direct impact on the kind of journalism we as a society can afford.  I'd be really interested to see what you and Brady have to say about the news industry, so I hope you cover it in one of the upcoming podcasts."

Imgur hosts a lot of original content, sure the most popular images tend to be freebooted pictures, but there is still original content hosted there. 9gag, photobucket and many many other sites are just (if not more in the case of 9gag) problematic with freebooted images.  In addition, many redditors/imgurs will link to the original content if there isn't proper credit.  About them not sharing profit, I think that that shouldn't be an issue. Facebook, G+, reddit and many other social sites don't share profit. Even with Youtube, the majority of users don't see any money from the ads displayed on the video page.  It's a trade off in this case: free image/video/text hosting in exchange for letting them display ads on the page.  I sure hope you continue for more than 10 episodes. :)  Cheers from Israel!"

On the one hand people want to support the Youtube creators they watch, or the bloggers they read, or whatever.    On the other hand, when pages that should load quickly take forever to load and the content you want is 20% of the page real estate while the rest is ads, and there are pop-ups interrupting you and auto-playing ads with maxed volume, you desperately crave a clean, uncluttered internet like Grey craves a house with no trinkets.  Some Adblocking software allow non-intrusive ad sources which benefit or at least minimally annoy viewers as well as benefiting content creators.  They exist to provide the relief folks overwhelmed by the worst kind of advertising crave, while allowing the best kind that people want or at least don't mind.  I'm curious to know what Grey and Brady think are the downside of ads as well as the upside of ads from both a user's and a content creator's perspective."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,TheEmptyVessel,2,Thu Mar 6 19:22:56 2014 UTC,"Spinning off the new term 'freeboot,' I think the word 'bootleg' would go nicely as a new word kind of meaning infringement. For example, if I post a CGPGrey video to my YouTube channel, I am a 'bootlegger,' and I have 'bootlegged' CGPGrey's video."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,arkenteron,2,Fri Mar 7 05:24:12 2014 UTC,"Ad blocking software is democracy in action. Installing ad blocking software is literally installing democracy. It gives you the power to vote.  Can't be bothered to vote? You get Fascism (Sorry Brady): Buy a computer, and turn it on for the first time. All power to the corporation who was benevolent enough to provide it. Missing something? Pay up. They don't think you should be allowed to vote (or install software outside their walled garden).  The anarco-socialist position would be something like:    The Internet exists for the good of the people.  The advertising regimen is a tyranny. It can not be saved. It must be destroyed, and a new better system must arise from the ashes. Yes ad blocking software directly hurts the system, that is the point.  CGP Grey should be compensated, but he should find a different method than ads. Subbable is great! Power directly from the people.   As a reasonable person, I think the correct position lies somewhere between zero and infinity.  As with any democratic system. Some people vote in ways we disagree with, and find unprincipled. Blocking all ads everywhere is like being a single issue voter (no ads), voting for the anarco-socialist party.  I would make the argument:   Black-listing abusive content is a right. (Down with Fascism) Democracy is good. Install Ad Block. Install choice. (Yay Democracy) Democracy is a responsibility. It is an ethical obligation to be an educated voter.  (Don't be a freebooter). If you must white-list, white-list well. Well = Intentionally, Ethically, Etc.   If this concept was widely adopted, it would make the internet better."

Every few months I have a clean out and filling up bags of things I no longer need feels good."
CGPGrey,1z0vz6,DrPigFarmer,2,Sat May 3 10:53:14 2014 UTC,"Hello Grey,  I know this is a bit old, but I'm just getting around to listening to all your podcasts, and I wanted to comment on the ad blocking issue. This sounds very similar to a biological concept called Batesian mimicry. Many animals have distinctive colouration to warn they are venomous or poisonous (e.g. black and yellow stripes on bees). Predators can then learn to avoid them, without the venomous or poisonous animal needing to die or waste precious venom. In Batesian mimicry, nondangerous animals may take advantage of this by matching the colouration of the dangerous ones. One example would be a fly with yellow and black stripes. The mimic then gains the advantages of the dangerous animal, without the costs. However, this only works when mimics are a very small proportion of the population. If mimics become too frequent two things happen. First, the truly dangerous animal will become disadvantaged as the predators response is weakened by experiences with the mimic. This causes the non-mimic to start to differentiate itself from the mimc, or suffer the consequences. Second, the predators will become better and better at distinguishing the mimic from the real thing, creating an arms race of sorts as the mimc tries to match the true form."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,MindOfMetalAndWheels,76,Tue Feb 18 21:43:44 2014 UTC,"How do you two feel about adblockers?  Is that infringement, theft, piracy or another fringe term my ignorant person is unaware of?"
CGPGrey,1ya24y,phalanfy,66,Wed Feb 19 00:39:37 2014 UTC,That's a good topic idea.
CGPGrey,1ya24y,Cthulusuppe,28,Wed Feb 19 08:07:46 2014 UTC,"If you discuss this topic, could you please touch on the idea that adblockers might be a consumer right?  Whether you agree or disagree.  Content creators can prevent adblockers' utility simply by making the ad an integrated part of the content.  If that would violate a content creator's flexibility, freedom or creativity is something else worthy of discussion, I suppose.  Personally, I avoided using adblockers for a long time because I like supporting the content I consume, but eventually I caved and got one because more and more of the content I enjoyed played ads at volumes twice that of the content, which was simply intolerable.  When I found myself watching a video with my finger hovering over the mute button on my keyboard, I knew I had to get an adblocker.    I turn adblocker off for sites that don't violate my ears, though I'm not sure how common that is among consumers.  Hulu is an example of a site that runs tons of ads that I don't mind viewing because they're relatively painless, but vocal redditors seem to despise Hulu's ads.  With consumers' individual tolerance being variable, who knows how fair adblockers are to content providers?...  I will admit that there's tons of video content on the internet I'd avoid consuming at all if I didn't have my adblocker.  Crackle, for example, was a huge violator with ads at least 3 times louder than the content they provide."

CGPGrey,1ya24y,TotallyNotAnAlien,2,Fri Feb 21 03:05:34 2014 UTC,I really like it when websites detect my ad blocker and have a polite   Welcome ad block user. Would you mind white listing us?

CGP Grey might be the same to some extent. If you stay away from big, popular subreddits, I think you see less of the negative aspects."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,flamesdivide,2,Wed Feb 19 16:00:19 2014 UTC,"Apparently, large parts of reddit are full of Nice Guy misogynistic types. But like Brady said, it's all about where you are. Tumblr has more women, so there's more proana (pro-anorexia) blogs and things, and reddit (I believe) has more men, so there would be more sexism. There are some really awful sections of youtube too. It's all about which pockets you're a part of."

CGPGrey,1ya24y,samuel2097,16,Fri Feb 21 07:20:22 2014 UTC,"I'm a listener living in Japan. I tried to leave a review on iTunes, but because my iTunes account was originally registered in the US it is irrevocably tied to the US iTunes Store, as is any and all reviews that I write. I don't have a Japanese credit card, so I am also unable to create a Japanese iTunes account to use instead. Nevertheless, add at least one listener in Japan to the country tally!  As for an alternative word to ""infringement"", may I propose ""eyejack"", ""myjack"", and/or ""buyjack""? These are plays on the word ""hijack"", and will have three different use cases:   Buyjack -- when infringement with the intent to illicitly profit from the source material, thus the ""buys"" that the content owner could have received have been usurped. This would normally be covered by ""piracy"", but as was pointed out in the episode, pirates have a somewhat positive connotation in popular culture, whereas hijackers generally do not. Eyejack --  infringement occurring for the purpose of attracting attention or an audience. This covers cases when content is copied without proper attribution, such as unauthorized video mirrors on YouTube. This  hearkens back to the highly-coveted ""eyeballs"" of the dot-com bubble, referring to the number of visitors who visit a site and therefore a proxy for a site's advertising earning potential. Myjack -- infringement for personal use. This is probably the most common form of piracy on the Internet, and it is often lumped in with ""piracy"" and ""theft"". I believe that ""piracy"" is inappropriate because it traditionally refers to infringement for financial gain (see ""buyjack""). ""Theft"" is also unsuitable because it implies that the rightful owner is no longer in possession of the item, which is not necessarily true with the advent of digital copying.   What do you think?"
CGPGrey,1ya24y,amphicoelias,3,Wed Feb 19 12:02:39 2014 UTC,"I approve of buyjack as a word and/or phrase, but the other two (eyejack, myjack) would never be adopted seriously in English speaking countries because of the slang term 'jack' being linked to masturbation, I fear.

CGPGrey,1ya24y,meidei,2,Wed Feb 19 14:09:33 2014 UTC,I think you're missing a few letters
CGPGrey,1ya24y,OtterVonnBismarck,7,Wed Feb 19 03:51:54 2014 UTC,"Theft Act 1968 (UK): 1 Basic definition of theft.  (1)A person is guilty of theft if he dishonestly appropriates property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the other of it; and “thief” and “steal” shall be construed accordingly.  (2)It is immaterial whether the appropriation is made with a view to gain, or is made for the thief’s own benefit.  This section is particularly relevant:  4“Property”.  (1)“Property” includes money and all other property, real or personal, including things in action and other intangible property.  This can be used towards both of your arguments for theft vs. infringement, but I'd be tempted to err on Brady's side here. The specific phrasing of ""including things in action and other intangible property"" seems to me to be very applicable to intellectual property, including depriving a copyright holder of future earnings (taking a share or what may come to the holder rather than taking what the holder already has could be an example of ""intangible"" property).  Whilst Grey could make the argument that the copyright infringer may not be intending to deprive the holder of anything permanent, I would be inclined to say that copyright infringement is theft.  There's probably more up to date legislation specifically pertaining to intellectual property disputes, but I thought I'd dig up the actual definition of theft."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,samisjiggy,5,Wed Feb 19 14:12:57 2014 UTC,"'Theft' becomes a problematic concept in terms of content piracy not just because the copyright infringer is probably not intending to permanently deprive the rightful holder of the property, but is in fact not permanently depriving the rightful holder of the property. What they are depriving the copyright holder of is not the object itself, but the copyright holder's right to dictate who can access the object, and under what circumstances. It's more like sneaking into a museum to see the Hope Diamond than breaking into a museum and stealing the Hope Diamond. (There was an Australian court ruling a few years back which made the analogy between content infringement and trespass, which I thought was very compelling.)   Where this becomes more complex is in cases where someone obtains access to a work (either legally or illegally) and then asserts a fraudulent right of authorship (ownership) over it by e.g. uploading it to YouTube. In that case it's like someone has built a tunnel into the museum and is now selling tunnel tickets to the public (or, more literally, profiting by plastering the walls of the tunnel with advertisements). The Hope Diamond will still be in the museum, and people can still access it properly through the front entrance, but the museum itself will lose money that could be used for new displays and suchlike as an increasing number of people find it easier to go round the back and access the museum that way. Even apart from the museum's right to oversee its doorways and eject trespassers, ultimately, everyone who wants to see the museum - both the front and back-door entrants - will probably miss out on new things that they might have enjoyed because of the tunnel."

CGPGrey,1ya24y,Jkuz,9,Wed Feb 19 16:31:54 2014 UTC,"Here's the idea of a replacement term for ""infringement on copyright"": Copywrong  Also Brady seems to lump in plagiarizing journalists with artist who remix and consumers who copy music for friends.  We all need a lesson on what copyright really means. From Wikipedia: Copyright is a legal concept, enacted by most governments, that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution, usually for a limited time, with the intention of enabling the creator of intellectual wealth (e.g. the photographer of a photograph or the author of a book) to receive compensation for their work and be able to financially support themselves. link  That last part is important.  If the actions of the copier are intended to or inadvertently subvert the compensation of the creator then it is a clear infringement of the copyright.  But the compensation may never have been there in the first place.  I hypothesize that the majority of ""piracy"" cases are not subverting compensation of the creator because the ""pirate"" was never going to pay in the first place.  Lets say a friend burns a CD of this cool new band for you.  If he couldn't do that were you really going to go down to Blockbuster Music (god I'm old) and pay $22 for it? (Remember when CD's cost that much?)   A lot of data shows that making material easily copiable increases sales. link  Perhaps because it gives the consumer a chance to sample a product before they decide to purchase it.  If that CD a friend burned for you was really good then you might actually fork over $22 for it.  Anecdotally, I purchased more music when I had Napster than any other time in my life.  I think it comes down to this: If what you're producing isn't worth the price you're asking then no amount of copyright will help you.  If you're producing a quality product and asking a competitive price people will happily part with their money for it and copyright can help combat flagrant attempts to steal the gains of your labor.  Brady's tone got me a riled up.  But he's smart.  So I like him."

You do recognize, when an audience is applauding just out of politeness, but it really is all you get. Even if you do talk to them, they usually won't discuss rhe details of your performance with you. They hear it, applaud (or not) and thats it. Oh wow, this has become sort of long!

(fe: grey could casualy talk about a subject that would be clear to him, but maybe not so much for the listeners, thats where brady comes in with some sharp questions to improve the clarity and sharpness on that subject)  TL;DR: Grey is a huge information cannon, and brady is the engineer that keeps it firing as accurately as possible.

I am fairly new to the podcast scene/culture, so I am not even sure if it is a valid question, but: What is the aim, the purpose of the podcast? I do enjoy the discussion, it is thoughtful and thought provoking, it is on relevant topics and very pleasant to listen to. But it doesn't have the sole edu-entertaining (edutaing ?) purpose as the videos from both you and Brady. Maybe to rephrase the question, what is the desired audience reaction?  Again, I didn't listen to many podcasts, apart from Night Vale (All hail the glow cloud!), so maybe the whole podcast purpose is self-sustaing; ""we like things, let's talk about things and put it on the internet, then find more things to talk about""."

It instantly became one of my favourite podcasts. I was always impressed with Brady's ability to ask questions I didn't even realize I wanted to know answers for but now I'm just blown away.  On the topic of approving comments on youtube I think it would be interesting to try to make a bot that would moderate the comments. Technically it's a really simple program to write, all the challenge is in tweaking the code so it knows which phrases are bad. I know that this is what youtube's filter is doing but making something that is tweaked specifically for a channel which videos it is moderating would be interesting. It could even look for comments with a lot of thumbs down and learn new patterns. I might experiment with that when I get some free time."

Brady mentioned that he has a video about Vietnam that doesn't fit into any of his youtube channel and I think it shows that this podcast is an appropriate place (not for the video of course) for such topics.  Well, with that out of the way I also wanted to ask something. You mentioned a study about the click rate on video titles (I believe the word was ""teasy""?), do you have the link to that? I am very interested in reading more. Thanks again for all the content. Cheers!"
CGPGrey,1ya24y,75Rollo,3,Wed Feb 19 00:17:41 2014 UTC,"Another enjoyable podcast by to content creators that I enjoy. Also I'd like to mention that my name is also Derek so when you refereed to Derek of Veritasium, I decided to pretend that you two were talking to me and that was an very uplifting.  And on the ""argument"" for infringement vs. theft when it comes to content distributed on the internet and viewed on connected devices, I'm going to have to side with you Grey. I feel the word 'thief' in this context is meant, especially by large corporations that don't want to adapt to change, to eliset the association to people, who say, share an mp3 file with their friends as 'criminals' and criminals, as we are lead to believe, are bad people who want to bring harm to those around them.  Where I see 'infringement' is using a piece of contentment without the creators permission or against the terms laid out by the creator. Or the act of hosting the creators content where views or ad revenue cannot be received by the creator and/or received by the infringing host.  And yes I see that some people would interpret those as the same thing, which they could be. And my response to that would be that, just like how you discussed that that law has a lot do with the context of how the trial proceeds, that how we use ""infringement"" vs ""theft"" is all contextual to how the creator feels about the act vs. how much ""power"" that creator holds. And by power, I refer to say NBC or Viacom vs. individual youtube creators.  I'm not entirety sure if I've actually made any valid point, but I'm not going to try to refine this as I'd be here for month's editing this comment."

CGPGrey,1ya24y,tomhfh,3,Wed Feb 19 02:53:01 2014 UTC,"I have three observations I would like to comment on concerning the content of this podcast and one follow up to the four lights.  1) I really enjoy listening to Brady.  Without this podcast, I may have never known of his channel(s) and subscribed.  2) The chemistry between Grey and Brady works well.  Brady does an incredible job as the inquisitor to help keep the conversation moving forward while Grey educates us with his point of view.  It's a brilliant dynamic.  3) The quality of comments or feedback is directly related to the topic being reviewed.  Educational videos will provoke a more thought out response than a vapid vanity video based on what you just ate and where you get your hair done at.    And lastly...  The four lights analogy is different for men and women based on Mrs Numberphile's observation and Grey's own admission.  Women are wired in parallel while men are wired in series.  These podcasts are great thus making my feedback nothing more than an ""attaboy, good job!""."

I love your laugh btw, Grey :) And Brady sounds like a white Morgan Freeman."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,JeffDujon,3,Wed Feb 19 14:45:21 2014 UTC,"Grey, as soon as you said you were rereading something in college I knew you were going to say the Lord of the Rings. It's fascinating about the first edition Hobbit changes, I'm glad to know that. Have you read the Silmarllion or any other parts of the larger legendarium? There's lots of wonderful material there for the discussion you guys were having about changing a story and how much the creator owes the fans, etc. I wonder, if Tolkien had been writing now, would his world have had time to become so well developed? How might the digital age have affected that process?"
CGPGrey,1ya24y,doubleplushomophobic,3,Wed Feb 19 18:08:33 2014 UTC,"Well done to you for managing to read the ""larger legendarium"", I'm afraid that I gave up due to the hopeless editing.  As for well developed worlds in modern times, I would say that although the writing style is perhaps not as accessible, the Tale of The Malazan Book of the Fallen probably has the most developed world that I've come across (sans language - but remember that Tolkein was a philologist whilst Erikson was an archaeologist/anthropologist).  Modern fantasy is littered with authors inventing languages, histories, magic systems, geography, etc. However, I do think that they all owe a lot to Tolkein in terms of inspiration.  As for the digital age, I like to believe that it would have broadened his horizons more easily and allowed him to include aspects of more diverse cultures. Terry Pratchet (I actually don't like his books) is a classic example - he uses technology very effectively in the way he writes."

If I break into your house and steal your tv, I'm depriving you of your use of it (even if I return it later), but if I make a perfect copy using your tv as a model and therefore have one of my own also, that's fundamentally different."

CGPGrey,1ya24y,b2kd4judge,3,Wed Feb 19 22:43:16 2014 UTC,"Re the length and time of the podcast:  4 comes in at 96 minutes long. Now whilst I suspect that this might be too long for a lot of people, I personally do not mind.  I happen to be a fan of long form journalism, which sadly is on the wane as newspapers chase ever harder for dwindling dollarpounds. The thing is though, as this is an audio format rather than something which has to be watched, it means that  it can be put on and listened to whilst you do other things (and for me that means whilst at work).  What this means in real terms is that ideas can be unpacked at length, pulled apart and analysed, which is closer in spirit to long form journalism than a four minute burst on Youtube.  Aside: This is also the reason why cricket works so well on the radio. Cricket takes five days to play and so the whole thing is like playing the long game. A picture paints a thousand words but I would rather hear a thousand words paint a more colourful picture."

CGPGrey,1ya24y,MuffledPancakes,8,Tue Feb 18 22:16:49 2014 UTC,"I agree, ""stealing"" has a physical element to it, like stealing a wallet.  If there is a sale for only 10 cookies normally costing you $2 each, but now they cost $1, and the person in front in the line buys all 10 cookies at ones, did he steal $10 from you? I mean, now you have to pay $20 in stead of $10.  A common example: Adobe Photoshop is really expensive. By downloading it illegally, Adobe is missing a lot from you. But if it were impossible to download for free, would you still choose Adobe or would you go for a cheaper alternative? So, in a sense, by downloading Photoshop, are you also stealing from Photoshop alternatives?  I think that these examples show most of all is that the words we have right now are really not equipped to handle all the new use cases we have with new technology."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,Gourounaki,2,Wed Feb 19 00:02:13 2014 UTC,"Honestly, if I was never able to download Photoshop 5.0 when I was in my early teens, I would have never become a graphic designer and would have never even needed to actually purchase their software. Adobe knows this, which is why they don't fight copy protection too hard. However, they are making a switch to the cloud, so who knows, in the coming years, teens might not be able to pirate their software anymore and in the long-term, Adobe might actually suffer a market loss."

I like ""appropriating"" for this. Name it after an unscrupulous politician or celebrity and let the Internet do the rest.

Consider the following scenario.  You make a video and it is great, but these videos are in English, so the majority of people in the world don't have access to them. These people would never watch your video without a translation. Let's also presume that you have no intention to translate and nobody is willing to pay you for rights to translate.  If somebody makes a bootleg translation of your video, it is popular, and that person even makes money off of the video, have you been stolen from? We can imagine two worlds, one where this bootleg didn't happen and as we established, a translation wasn't really in the cards, so you made the same amount of money, and one where this bootleg translation has occurred. The difference in your income between these scenarios is negligible (putting aside issues such as brand dilution or improved brand awareness). However, in the bootleg translation scenario, you are looking at all of the impressions you could be getting income from and you start counting that money as being 'stolen' from you because the person should have made an arrangement with you before using your work.  This scenario is intentionally a bit specific because it involves a demographic which is mostly isolated from the one for which your videos are normally aimed. The people watching because of the infringement in that scenario would not have watched if not for the infringement. To say that somebody is 'stealing' something which you don't or wouldn't ever have if not for the activity is disingenuous even if .  When the demographics overlap, there is an argument that some stealing is taking place, but calculating how much of it is stealing and how much of it is money which you would have never seen in a status-quo universe?  In this argument, I am not going so far as to say that these people are acting appropriately by not licensing the work, just that there is a real difference between people creating value by repurposing your work without payment and stealing, where you are denied access to things you had or would reasonably have had if the behavior had not occurred.  To address Brady's assertion about people breaking in and taking a television, watching it, and then returning it. We have to overlook the damage or risk of damage to the television and the surrounding property and we have to overlook the risk that somebody might want to use the television during the period where it is missing. If we overlook these problems, how much would you really care if your television mysteriously disappeared only when you weren't looking and was sufficiently guaranteed to return in identical condition whenever you (or anybody else in the vicinity) might notice its presence? You haven't lost any value you might be getting from your television and presumably other people are gaining value by being able to use it when it would otherwise be wasted. You have legitimate reason to demand a fee from those who might be using it, particularly if they are making a profit from its utilization, but this arrangement is very different from if somebody took your television and you no longer had access to it."

CGPGrey,1ya24y,zombiepiratefrspace,2,Wed Feb 19 18:00:18 2014 UTC,"Just curious: Grey, do you or Brady have any further info regarding visiting the Royal Society in London? After listening to Feedback on Feedback I'm psyched about visiting! Is there anything you must do beforehand? I visited the website, the most I could find was that they have occasional public events. Did you visit during an event, or can anyone visit anytime? Does anyone have a more helpful website with relevant info?"
CGPGrey,1ya24y,theworldisround123,2,Wed Feb 19 20:38:14 2014 UTC,"Grey and Brady, you should consider giving us a tour of the Royal Society some time! Why not during Wikimania 2014, when a whole bunch of your fans will be in town anyway? By the way, have you thought about attending Wikimania?"
CGPGrey,1ya24y,jaudette,2,Mon Feb 24 14:39:53 2014 UTC,I too would be very interested. I searched their website and could only find events.
CGPGrey,1ya24y,GlassOrange,2,Tue Mar 11 20:37:20 2014 UTC,Same here.
CGPGrey,1ya24y,lxUn1c0,2,Thu Mar 13 18:52:04 2014 UTC,Brady's dad is a(n ex-)journalist so I assume using journalism-type moves on him would be ineffective.
CGPGrey,1ya24y,Tao_McCawley,2,Wed Feb 19 21:28:28 2014 UTC,"Just wanted to say that I've never listened to a podcast before and after deciding to give yours a go, I have never been more interested in listening to people in my life. Much like you I play video games to escape certain areas of my life and listening to your podcast whilst doing so makes for an amazing hobby and entertainment. I literally cannot wait for more and have already been engrossed into downloading each one for repeated listening. Thanks a bunch Grey, not only have you opened my up to educational YouTube videos but now you've also introduced me to podcasts. Next stop: AudioBooks!"
CGPGrey,1ya24y,maybedawn,2,Wed Feb 19 21:31:21 2014 UTC,"Maybe this is just me, but I think Grey can be a bit too critical of himself. Does anyone else agree?"

CGPGrey,1ya24y,maybedawn,2,Thu Feb 20 20:08:23 2014 UTC,I just wanted to say I love your podcast :)
CGPGrey,1ya24y,yoho139,2,Thu Feb 20 21:22:52 2014 UTC,"Absolutely love that you are now making podcasts.  Have always been an avid podcast listener and now you and Brady have do one.  One question I do have is about the length. Are they all going to be random lengths or are you going to do a standardized length, and also is this a trial thing or will these continue to release every week for the foreseeable future? Thanks and keep up the great work."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,TheLeviathong,2,Fri Feb 21 08:35:15 2014 UTC,"a word for what you guys are talking about when you seem to talk about copyright infringement would be ""plagiarism"" when a company or person takes something which you made and pass it off as their own. no one like plagiarism.   a person taking something copyrighted like, say a pokemon game, and making a copy of it to be played on an emulator is copyright infringement, but it allows that person to play the game in way it may not have been intended but which is never the less good, it also allows them to hook that same game in that emulator to a python script to parse commands from people in a chat giving something to the community at large...though still violating copyright.  the doujin community violate copyright but produce amazing things and help fuel the anime community.   i think the thing you are railing on really is where copyright infringement is plagiarism."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,Keyan2,2,Fri Feb 21 18:52:11 2014 UTC,"I think that infringement is like ""Hey, I am stopping you from making money from this content, or getting the credit you deserve"" but Theft is more like ""You have that, and I am going to take it away"" ... If that makes any sense at all"
CGPGrey,1ya24y,autowikibot,2,Sat Feb 22 12:23:54 2014 UTC,"I know a lot of these comments talk about how great Grey is (and hell, we all know he is), but Brady's contribution is just as important in my mind. I'd love to hear more about what Brady does and his past. This is a great series guys, I hope you extend them further than the planned 10 episodes."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,avion365,2,Sat Feb 22 13:05:43 2014 UTC,"It's funny that you mentioned Bill Bryson's narrating voice, /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels. A few years ago, I listened to his Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid audiobook, and I, too, felt like his speaking style was engaging and easy on the ears. I had difficulty placing his accent, so I looked up where he was from and learned that he lived on the island of Great Britain for many years. I concluded that his time there somehow led him to have a hybrid Midwest/English accent, and I decided that I really liked that accent.  The first time I watched one of your videos, I thought to myself: ""Wow, that guy sounds a lot like Bill Bryson to me."" I wasn't surprised when I learned that you were from the States but then moved to England."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,samuel2097,6,Sat Feb 22 18:55:18 2014 UTC,"Even if you keep the letter sounds in your accent, I think there is a cadence shift that is impossible to avoid."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,bodet328,2,Sat Feb 22 19:44:04 2014 UTC,"I mostly just lurk on podcasts, and out of the several I listen to, I feel almost guilt-tripped into giving feedback for the first time ever.  I say ""almost"" because it's more that I feel a bit inspired to actually find out how to do it.  I tried to do this through iTunes first, but I think it ate my review.  Or something.  So first of all - so far, I love this podcast.  Both Brady and Grey are pretty well-spoken, and I love that it feels so much like a true, spontaneous dialogue where each person is willing to give and to take, and to actually consider points of view rather than just trying to convince one another.  That being said, I've got a lot of thoughts on some of these things.  I think one of the reasons that people don't submit more reviews is that there's some level of barrier to entry for a lot of people who are new to reddit, or iTunes, or whatever.  It took me a while to figure out how to even comment through iTunes - it's not a straightforward process.  And signing up for Reddit was kinda intimidating - for me, as someone who'd never used it before, any oblique references to it had put it somewhere in my mental catalogue near 4chan.  I was actually really surprised, in signing up just to throw down a post because Grey had said he's responsive on the reddit, at how easy it was to sign up.    Meanwhile, I think that one of the biggest problems with positive review isn't necessarily that it's positive, but that most people don't know how to give specific positive feedback.  If I was not making up things in my head when I thought I heard that Grey was a teacher, I'm surprised that that experience with professionally giving feedback didn't come into the conversation.  Definitely one of the things I've learned as a teacher is that for any feedback to be useful, it has to be specific, whether positive or negative.  ""Great job!"" isn't nearly as useful as ""Great job with x, y, z...!""    And to Brady's point about reading reviews for his theoretical (I'll tell myself that it's theoretical, so that I don't feel as lame about my vacations) to the Maldives, and how he would want to go straight to the negative review, I think there's a very sound reasoning to that.  I'm reminded of an xkcd strip where hat-guy is putting a live bobcat into an  Amazon shipment, and the alt text points out that you could do this to 1 in every 30 shipments and still have a 97% positive rating.  It makes it awfully important to check that one negative review to know that instead of getting an office chair, you might wind up with a live, very angry bobcat.  I'd want to know.    Anyway, thanks for these podcasts!  Love 'em!"
CGPGrey,1ya24y,achenara,2,Sun Feb 23 22:41:26 2014 UTC,"Really enjoying the series. They are though provoking chats about 'stuff' that is interesting and relevant.   One thing I'd like to see is perhaps a guest with a ten minute segment, like Henry from Minute Physics?"
CGPGrey,1ya24y,SeventhCycle,2,Tue Feb 25 01:27:43 2014 UTC,"I came here to complain about the statement that ""anybody who is anybody in science"" was a member of the Royal Society but then checked up on some Physicists I was sure couldn't have been members and was surprised. Really the only name I couldn't find there was Kurchatov, but given that he died early and they even had Zel'dovitch, that might just have been coincidental.  Impressive.  Also, regarding your three-hour remark, there are podcasts out there that are very long and very good. For instance, the freakshow (http://freakshow.fm) regularly goes beyond the five hour mark. And what they do is of really high quality, mostly because the members of the podcast team are interesting people doing interesting and unconventional things with technology.  Your podcast, even though very young, is already quite good, though I suspect you could get some helpful inspiration about what is possible from the freakshow podcast. One of you wouldn't happen to speak German?"
CGPGrey,1ya24y,BaneOfOctopi,2,Tue Feb 25 21:09:53 2014 UTC,"I really enjoy listening to your podcast. However, this podcast was somewhat disappointing. The topics wandered all over the place. I preferred previous episodes, they had a topic that was much more focused."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,ghostofren,2,Sat Mar 1 15:23:55 2014 UTC,"I agree with Grey that ""infringe"" is the right word but I agree with Brady that it doesn't have the emotive connotations it needs."

CGPGrey,1ya24y,cryuji,2,Sun Mar 9 06:32:48 2014 UTC,"I think the word you're looking for, for ""taking others' content without permission for personal use and benefit,"" is plagiarism.

CGPGrey,1ya24y,theinternetaddict,4,Tue Feb 18 22:10:25 2014 UTC,"Brady, the difference between theft and infringement isn't that mind-blowing.   Theft removes the original. Infringement is a totally different thing, where I make a copy of something you made and then use it as my own without your permission, just like (internet) piracy isn't theft. It's piracy, you're making a copy. Pirating a video game doesn't make it so that the company that made that video game unavailable to anyone else.   Just because you feel like ""infringement"" is too nice of a word doesn't make it invalid, nor does it justify calling something that is very blatantly not theft ""theft"". You can't steal intellectual property, because it's not a physical thing. You can only infringe on someone else's copyright.  It was really hard for me to listen to the beginning of the podcast because of that, I was almost shouting at the screen."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,StartsAsNewRedditor,13,Tue Feb 18 22:14:57 2014 UTC,"Gosh, sorry. I think I do intellectually understand the difference. I just think it is a case where (for me) the language obscures the severity act.  For some reason, perhaps because it is so often used in sports commentary, I find the word ""infringement"" trivial...  But CGP Grey agrees with you!  Thanks for the feedback."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,kimroen,10,Tue Feb 18 23:07:24 2014 UTC,"Re-reading that comment it sounded a bit more hostile than I intended. Sorry! For me, as a person who makes things, sometimes using other people's things (with permission), the word ""infringement"" is rather scary, because that accusation could end with me living in a box with my dog."
CGPGrey,1ya24y,Jotuera,8,Tue Feb 18 23:14:49 2014 UTC,It's a sports word?

CGPGrey,1xqwms,Jim777PS3,7,Thu Feb 13 05:17:05 2014 UTC,Question: Is it possible for the podcast to become a regular thing? I know you said that this is a 10 part experiment out of the gate but if the show gets enough traction do you think it could be permanent?  Or would it detract from YouTube to much to make sense?   I kind of hope it becomes a regular thing because the idea of more CGP Grey in my ears would be amazing.

CGPGrey,1xqwms,NillieK,12,Fri Feb 14 15:17:39 2014 UTC,"Now that ive had a listen to all 3, I would like to share a couple of my thoughts. First off, I love it. I really do. I hope there is more to come, much more and I hope its not just an experiment that fades into the ether. But...  I think there was to much CPG and not enough Brady. I'm not saying that I do not want to hear every single word CPG says, not at all. I just want to hear a little bit more from Brady. I think CPG dominated the talking space a bit much and Brady didn't jump in as much as I would have liked.   But it also felt like the topics of discussion were picked by CPG and that he maybe prepared for them. It felt like Brady didn't have any input into the topics chosen for conversation or anything substantive to add to the topics as a result. Brady didn't seem to have a horse in the race and as a result just let CPG rattle on.   I think it would be better to maybe not pick a topic and just shoot the shit, see where it goes. Or maybe pick a topic but don't stick to it so firmly. Don't be afraid to let the convo stray and go wild. Go with the flow, as it were.   Also, the mea culpa and retractions that CPG started ep2 and ep3 with were a terrible way to start things off and a bit of a turn off. If you want to rehash some of the topics from the previous episode and correct a couple of things, thats cool. But do so in a conversation, don't read off a list of footnotes.   I really love the ""youtube insider"" talk and would love more of it, I find it fascinating.   A subreddit dedicated to the podcast is a must have! We would love to join in the discussion. For example, the ""People vs Lucas"" could have been a great homework assignment for the audience. We could have discussed it on reddit or listened to guys go into it a bit more. A little audience participation is good, me thinks.   Final note is on infringement and theft. CPG touched on it, but I wanted to clarify that infringing a copyright implies a loss of potential profit not actual profit, especially in terms of digital media. Nothing ""real"" is lost, so it cannot be called theft legally or morally.   Love it and can't wait for more!"
CGPGrey,1xqwms,gsuberland,16,Thu Feb 13 05:02:51 2014 UTC,It seems to be difficult to get Brady out of interviewer mode when he knows the conversation is being recorded.
CGPGrey,1xqwms,faikcem1,10,Thu Feb 13 08:03:43 2014 UTC,"Additional point on the ""potential profit"" loss argument - there's a fallacy within it which involves an assumption that all pirates would have been customers in the first place, had they not been able to get it for free.  The example I would give is this: imagine I offer you a new TV, which is slightly better than your existing TV, for £450. On any normal day you'd probably turn that down. Now imagine another guy offers it you for free if you'll come pick it up today. You jump at the offer. Did I lose you as a customer? No. You never were a customer."

Also I totally agree with the retractions too, they were a very negative way to start off with and a bit off putting.    Personally I found the podcasts to be too long, I think a lot of us are listening to them on the train/bus etc and 1 hour is too long. I think about 30mins is about right for most people.  Not so long its hard to fit into one sitting but long enough to fill a bus/train trip.   Edit: Mr Lumpking69 sorry about that :)"
CGPGrey,1xqwms,lumpking69,2,Fri Feb 14 05:02:37 2014 UTC,"Personally I found the podcasts to be too long   Just to speak for the people on the other end of that.  I listen to a lot of podcasts, several of them running at the three hour mark.  I would easily listen to CGP for that long.  Not wanting to say how many people are in this category, but we do exist and I really hate it when a particular cast is having a great rhythm and suddenly they have to cutoff because of a pre-determined cutoff.    Those limits are one of things I don't like about TV and Radio, I love that podcasts can and do use up as much time as they need, rather than cramming what they can into what they have."

I might not mind a whole hour if things even up a little bit."

However, I thought this video did a pretty good job explaining it objectively. Kudos!  If you're interested in learning more about jury nullification I'd strongly advise against googling it, there are a lot of jury nullification wackos out there. This is a great article about jury nullification that objectively analyzes and discusses it."
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,ONE_GUY_ONE_JAR,30,Wed Feb 12 16:19:18 2014 UTC,"I wanted to ask you. As a Attorney, do you know, if this exists outside of the US? For Example here in Germany. We dont have Jurys that decides the Trial. But A Judge and 2 Lay Judges which are ordinary civilians. I know that the Lay Judges can overrule the Decision of the real Judge. But how does Jury Nullification apply in this sense? Or does it even exist?"
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,littlea1991,26,Wed Feb 12 17:45:18 2014 UTC,"I don't know much about civil law systems like Germany and France, such as the role of lay judges. But I do know a lot about comparative law with countries like the UK and Australia. And jury nullification certainly exists there. My guess would be that jury nullification exists in Germany too.  All jury nullification is is when the trier of fact ignores evidence, usually because of a disagreement of the laws or likability of the defendant. The role of the jury is simply to determine the facts. If they ignore the weight of the evidence to change the outcome of the case, that's nullification. It can happen anywhere where the juries have discretion."
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,ONE_GUY_ONE_JAR,21,Wed Feb 12 17:58:07 2014 UTC,"There is no jury nullification in Germany as there are no juries. Although it's still officially called ""jury court"" (Schwurgericht).  During legal trials lay judges have essentially the same rights and duties as the professional one(s), for Germany specified in the constitution (Grundgesetz, GG), foremost to be impartial and uphold the letter of the law. Their votes are all equal so any majority of judges may overrule the rest (1+2 or 2+3 professional and lay judges depending on the severity of the case).  If any of those judges were to violate either the GG or their state's constitution in or outside of a trial they can be relieved, retired or relocated with a decision of the Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) according to Art.98(2) GG. There is no legal precedent for a ""I don't like this""-decision; if the judge or judges deliberately ruled against the presented evidence that's grounds for a retrial. There is also no real law against double jeopardy insofar as trials go, Art 103 GG merely states that nobody can be punished twice, not tried, which has been used as grounds for retrial of dubious acquittals before."

CGPGrey,1xpn9c,Sw0rDz,2,Thu Feb 13 09:33:53 2014 UTC,Can you really get in trouble if you bring it up at jury duty?
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,ONE_GUY_ONE_JAR,6,Thu Feb 13 00:34:04 2014 UTC,Not really in trouble. The thing is that there are a lot of jury nullification crazy people out there. If you bring up jury nullification during voir dire it's unlikely you'll be selected.
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,messyhair42,1 point,Thu Feb 13 01:07:42 2014 UTC,Can you explain nullification in the case where the jury finds the defendant violated the law but the law is unjust/unreasonably broad/bad and goes the route of nullification?
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,ONE_GUY_ONE_JAR,17,Wed Feb 12 22:59:00 2014 UTC,"Sure!  You have to remember that jury nullification isn't really a thing. I mean, it's not like there is some secret option where the juries have the option to do. If you pull up an old case that was nullified it's not like nullification is mentioned anywhere. When people study jury nullification it can be difficult. Jury proceedings are closed and they don't have to give their rationale. So how do you even know if a case was consciously nullified or whether it was just a really bad jury?  So basically what I'm saying is that it's hard to know what the jurors are thinking or what their mindset is. Some academic papers on jury nullification talk about how it was sometimes instructed to juries, so they could have played a part.   It's very rare for it to happen today, if we're talking about traditional nullification where the jury doesn't agree with the law. We still get reverse nullification all the time where the jury doesn't like the defendant and convicts them without sufficient evidence. Some people have said it's happened in drug cases. I would assume the jury deliberates and someone says ""Hey, this law isn't right. The defendant has broken the law, but punishing him isn't fair. The law isn't just. Let's return a verdict of not guilty."""
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,shadow1515,3,Wed Feb 12 23:11:24 2014 UTC,"Given that proceedings are confidential, how does one go about determining whether jury nullification (or reverse nullification since you brought it up) has ever happened? Someone must have originally coined the term; did they do so because they thought it had happened and needed a term for it, or as part of an academic analysis of potential problems with the jury trial system?"
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,ONE_GUY_ONE_JAR,4,Thu Feb 13 04:39:30 2014 UTC,"It was a much bigger issue in the 16th-19th century. Back then judges and lawyers would talk about it often, sometimes even bringing it up in cases. There was a big kerfuffle over stuff like that. Even John Jay, the first Supreme Court justice, told jurors how it was their duty to decide if the law was just.   Even when you don't have strong evidence like this, it becomes obvious depending on the issue. The video mentioned fugitive slave laws, which is often where the debate focused. An analysis of cases in slave states v. non-slave states showed that juries were much more likely to convict in slave states on the same evidence. The only conclusion is that the juries in the non-slave states were ignoring the evidence because they didn't agree with laws."

Canada of article  Jury nullification:      Although extremely rare, jury nullification does occur in Canada, however, as the prosecution has powers to appeal the resulting acquittal, it lacks the finality found in the United States. In R. v. Latimer, 2001 SCC 1, the Supreme Court discussed jury nullification, and indicated it is a duty of the presiding justice to try and prevent it from occurring.  Perhaps the most famous cases of jury nullification in Canada were the various trials of Henry Morgentaler, who openly operated a private abortion clinic in violation of the Criminal Code. Repeated attempts at prosecuting Morgentaler resulted in acquittals at jury trials in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1988 Supreme Court case, R. v. Morgentaler, 1988 SCR 30, a nullification was appealed all the way to the country's highest court, which struck down the law in question.

It's possible the prosecution would be inclined to dismiss you if they think you'll vote ""not guilty"" even if the evidence points the other way. It's possible the defense will want to keep you around. I'm no expert, but there is a process of negotiating for jurors where the two parties compromise on which jurors will be used, and which will be dismissed until they agree on the 12 that will be used."

CGPGrey,1xpn9c,Sesquame,2,Wed Feb 12 19:38:17 2014 UTC,"In general, when you're called in for jury selection (otherwise known as voir dire in fancy legal* speak) the judge will ask a bunch of questions, including, usually, that one. If you say yes to any of them, the judge or lawyers could (and frequently do) ask you to elaborate on your answer. There's a chance the judge/lawyers might ask you if you could set aside your beliefs about X in order to carry out your duties as a juror.   Now, for people who are hardcore jury nullification fanatics, that's an easy answer. But if you're a jury nullification fan solely for the purposes of getting yourself out of jury duty, well, that's stickier, since you probably could set aside those beliefs just as easily as you picked them up. As with everything else, if you don't tell the truth, you've just committed perjury.   *I am not a lawyer, please do not construe this as legal advice, etc, etc."

There are groups that attempt to get around this, however, by standing in front of courthouses during trials and handing out jury nullification literature to every person entering or leaving (so that they can claim not to be targeting jurors in the trial). Success at avoiding the wrath of the court with this tactic has been mixed.  edit: several typos"

CGPGrey,1xpn9c,Pyromane_Wapusk,2,Wed Feb 12 16:16:55 2014 UTC,"The difference seems to be whether a country has a common law system or a civil law system. Jury trials for criminal cases are often found in the former and seldom in the latter.  Most countries only use them for criminal cases - far as I can tell the US and Canada are the only two where juries are common outside that.  If you have been charged with murder then in places where juries are common you generally have the right to one, where you can argue to a panel of reasonable people that no reasonable person would think you committed it.  If, instead, you have, say, been informed of the compulsory acquisition of your house and you wish to challenge the paltry sum you have been offered, then a jury is not required and you (or preferably your lawyer) argue your case to the judge, who interprets the law, keeping in mind precedent from previous similar cases, and creating precedent for future cases with his or her decision.  In common law systems, judicial cases (usually the second type I mentioned) are the primary source of law, while in civil law systems it is what is written down that matters most.  Both sides have pros and cons. Civil law is seen as more stable since the laws are rigid with precedence giving guidelines; common law is seen as more flexible and can adapt to changing situations without needing laws amended by the legislative body with precedence being the majority of the law."

These are unlimited. If a juror has an obvious conflict of interest or demonstrates an inability to be fair and impartial, one party can have them excused for cause by requesting it during voir dire- the jury selection proceeding. The other is preemptive challenges, each side can eliminate a juror for any reason- and doesn't have to reveal the reason. Those are limited in number however. Each state has a different number but it averages between 4 and 5."

I have a feeling you'd get more out of a thorough google session than by me explaining it though.  Here, have some wikipedia!  Specifically, have this bit here:   When a person is called for jury duty in the United States, that service is compulsory and one must attend. Failing to report for jury duty is not technically illegal and usually results in an individual simply being placed back into the selection pool to be called for another trial. However repeatedly ignoring a jury summons will result in strict penalties.[11] Employers are not allowed to fire an employee for being called to jury duty, but they are typically not required to pay salaries during this time.[11] When attended, potential jurors may be asked to serve as a juror in a trial, or they may be dismissed."

CGPGrey,1xpn9c,yolomatic_swagmaster,3,Thu Feb 13 20:56:03 2014 UTC,"Precedences arent legaling binding in the US. There is an emphasis on ruling in favor of legal precedences, but that is more an aspect of civil legal proceedings (E.G. divorces, lawsuits, land disputes, contract disputes, disputes over the interpretation of the law (particularly in appeals of civil or criminal trials) and appeals.   Juries are not under any obligations to give verdicts that have legal precedence. They only have to decide if the defendant is in fact guilty or not. Since juries cant be sanctioned for ""wrong"" decisions, they can take all the evidence and throw it out the window and decide as they please. They are not supposed to do that. When they give a verdict that goes against what the evidence says its nullification (whether the jury knows of the existence of Jury nullification or not). You just cant try to biais a jury in telling them about jury nullification and trying to convince them that  they should vote against what the law says."

Of course it is, and I feel silly for not recognizing it.  But limiting the power of the government (and its laws) cuts both ways.  Ultimately it speaks to how important social movements are to improve social justice.  Just passing the Civil and Voting Rights Acts would not have mattered at all without changing the minds of the people who would serve as judge and jury.  I am now a little bit more sympathetic to the widespread condemnation of the people who's views I despise.  You get your free speech, but you also must be held accountable for what you say.  And this is recursive: don't attack or verbally harass the people shaming the despicable attitudes.  Where, oh where! does the vicious circle end!? ;-)"
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,DCPatentAtty,6,Wed Feb 12 15:32:57 2014 UTC,"In the common law system (basically most of the countries that were once part of the British Empire), a jury is ""the trier of fact,"" and the judge is the ""trier of law.""   So a classic question for  jury would be something like a witness says, ""I saw him do it,"" and the defendant says, ""Wasn't me."".  Someone has to decide who to believe, and in the Anglo-American system they say that it's better to have a random group of 12 common community members than somebody appointed by the same government that's prosecuting the guy.  But if there's no question of fact, only law, then there's no need for a jury.  In that case, you do want someone who's an expert in the law to decide the case, because the whole controversy is one of law.  An example of a ""question of law"" would be Congress passes a law that says, ""You can't burn the American flag,"" someone burns the American flag, admits to it, and gets prosecuted.  They say, ""But this law is against my right to free speech, which is protected by the Constitution.""  (For non-Americans, if there's a law that conflicts with the Constitution, the Constitution wins, and the other law is null and void.)  In that case, there's no question of fact- the guy who burned the flag admits he did it.  The only question is a legal question: does this law conflict with the Constitution?  So there would be no jury involved, it would only be a question for the judge to decide.  All-in-all, I think it's better to have a random selection of people deciding questions of fact (not questions requiring expertise in law) than appointed or elected judges.  Sure the juries can be biased but so can judges.  With a selection of 12, you have a better shot that you're balancing out the bias.  So the judge still has a pretty strong check on the jury.  If the judge says that there is no evidence to support a prosecution, he should never allow the defendant to go to trial.  (Because we (theoretically) think it's better for ten guilty person to go free than one innocent person to be wrongly convicted, it doesn't work the other way.  A judge can't say, ""You're 100% guilty so there's no need for a jury trial.)  And in the case of a non-criminal trial, a judge can say ""No rational jury could come to this conclusion,"" and order a new trial.  (As the video says, in a criminal trial, they can only do this to let a defendant go free, not to convict him.)  And in the American system, you really don't want to be tried by judges because judges are elected in most states.  Elected judges have a whole lot more to worry about letting a guilty guy go free than sending an innocent person to jail-nobody ever made a commercial saying, ""Judge So-and-So is too hard on crime,"" and won an election with it.  (People are starting to realize this problem, and there is a bit of a growing movement against elected judges)."

The judge can overturn guilty jury verdicts, but not jury verdicts of not guilty, which removes the possibility of the judge handing down an unwarranted guilty verdict for personal reasons if they exist.

There was also people similar to today's advocates who would speak on behalf on clients.    The idea is that if you have civilian people involved in the legal process, the law reflects society on the front line. Jury nullification is a good example of this.

Drug related offenses are a big reason that many crimes end with plea bargains and not trials."
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,PapaHudge,2,Wed Feb 12 18:02:44 2014 UTC,"So then, if there is a nullification, is the defendant technically convicted?  For example, lets say we have a defendant who was tried, but the jury nullified. He applies for a job at Grey Industries (The leading provider of Gears and beakers/flasks) who performs a background check on him. Will his record show that he is guilty even though he never served time in prison?"
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,dhc02,6,Thu Feb 13 00:18:12 2014 UTC,"If there is a nullification then they were found not guilty, so were not convicted."
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,kevinWilson94,1 point,Wed Feb 12 18:20:10 2014 UTC,"Not entirely true as mentioned toward the end of the video - it CAN go the other way around.  Juries can also find someone guilty even if there's no evidence to support it. However, in this case, due to the appeals process of a guilty verdict, it's basically useless."
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,nicholas818,3,Wed Feb 12 17:03:52 2014 UTC,"I think you're missing the subtle point here - jury nullification is when the jury think the defendant is guilty but state in court that the defendant is not-guilty.  From the outside, the defendant is found not guilty, so there is no conviction record, they are free to go and and can't be tried again for that charge (double jeopardy)."
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,CultofNeurisis,2,Wed Feb 12 17:18:51 2014 UTC,"No. The jury returned a Not Guilty verdict, so that is recorded. Records of the arrest and charges will still persist."
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,Tao_McCawley,2,Wed Feb 12 17:52:10 2014 UTC,Would someone care to explain to me how jury nullification can come about? I couldn't grasp it in this.
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,apothanein,2,Wed Feb 12 22:18:35 2014 UTC,"Let's say that I'm on a jury. Even though the evidence says that the person committed the crime, I am under no legal obligation, as a juror, to find them guilty. I cannot be held legally liable for coming to the ""wrong"" decision, and the person cannot be tried again if the jury finds them not guilty, no matter why the jurors decided to acquit that person. The law was made ""null"" by the jury in that instance."
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,MyNameDontAsk,1 point,Thu Feb 13 00:15:19 2014 UTC,So all the courts can do is maybe reform some legislation that had acted up?
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,Vesque,1 point,Wed Feb 12 17:28:19 2014 UTC,"No, there is no recourse. The person is not guilty and can't be tried again. That's it. There's no appeal, there's no review by the courts or by the legislature. The person is legally not guilty, and it doesn't matter that this particular person happened to actually commit the crime."
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,SleepyHarry,2,Wed Feb 12 18:48:35 2014 UTC,"Let's say in your state/local area, it is a criminal offense to walk backwards on a sidewalk, and the penalty is jail time. Someone is caught and arrested by police for walking backwards on a sidewalk, and the evidence is damming: there's video proof. You are a juror on the trial of this man. It is clear to you, beyond a reasonable doubt (the legal requirement in the US) that the man is guilty of walking backwards on the sidewalk. However, you, and the other jurors, all feel that the law he is being tried on is pointless. Even though he is guilty, and you know he is guilty, you return a not-guilty verdict because you don't believe the law has any merit in the first place, and refuse to convict. This is essentially what jury nullification is: the jury refuses to uphold a law that they view as pointless.    CGPGrey's video uses a classic example of lynch mobs in the Southern United States many years ago. Police departments would arrest and put on trial people who were accused (and often guilty) lynchings or hate crimes. However, regardless of the evidence produced in court, the jury would almost always find the defendant not guilty. This is jury nullification - they might know full well that the person is guilty of breaking the law, however they refuse to uphold the law in question, so it becomes null."

CGPGrey,1xpn9c,ArmandoAlvarezWF,2,Wed Feb 12 19:34:35 2014 UTC,"So a juror who nullifies fails in their duty as a juror. At the end of the day, the court trusts the jurors to do the right thing, and in their view, that doesn't include nullification.  Nathan Burney of the completely excellent Illustrated Law Comic has an interesting discussion:   What people tend to overlook is that the Grand Jury is absolutely empowered to nullify. The GJ’s job isn’t to decide guilt or innocence, but whether you should be charged with a crime in the first place. So not only are they there to decide whether there’s enough evidence to support a charge, but also to act as the “conscience of the community.” In other words, to decide whether it’s really just and fair that THIS person be prosecuted for THIS offense."

CGPGrey,1xpn9c,Sesquame,3,Wed Feb 12 16:02:47 2014 UTC,"Yes. There have been at least a couple of cases in the past few years where juries have nullified in trials of non-violent drug offenders.  Also, there are groups who have been trying to do jury education on the subject of nullification for a long time as a way of furthering their cause. One example is the liberty movement known as the Free State Project in New Hampshire. They do what they can to educate people in the areas they're practicing various forms of civil disobedience, in order to increase the chances of avoiding punishment should they be arrested."
CGPGrey,1xpn9c,AccountHaver25,2,Thu Feb 13 00:18:01 2014 UTC,Yes.

One thing though, when depicting anarchy (3:59) you used what looked to be an opposite color scheme to ""righteous will of the people"" to almost imply that anarchism employs anarchy (it doesn't). I'm sure that you meant the obvious definition of the word anarchy, but you put the anarchist movement symbol in the background of that slide implying otherwise.  I think it'd be a cool topic to do a video on the anarchist movement, what it actually means (since many people don't know) and perhaps some of the flaws or inconsistencies regarding it.  This was the first thing that I had read about the movement, however the article exhibits bias towards itself in my opinion: http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-are-you-an-anarchist-the-answer-may-surprise-you  ...

CGPGrey,1xpn9c,Poppamunz,2,Wed Feb 12 16:46:41 2014 UTC,"The first law (juries can't be blamed for whichever decision they make) means that the jury can (sort of) make any decision they like, without fear of getting told off.  The second law means that if a defendant is found (by the jury) ""not guilty"", they cannot be tried for the same thing again. This basically ensures that if I got arrested for stealing an apple, and then found not guilty by a jury, but the shop owner didn't believe me, he couldn't then get me tried for the same offense. In the eyes of the law, I am forever ""not guilty"". I believe this is referred to as ""double jeopardy"".  So because of these two laws, a jury can say ""not guilty"", regardless of the actual guiltiness of the defendant, and the defendant can't be retried for the same offence, so remains ""not guilty"" effectively forever.  The above statement is precisely nullification.  please do point out if I've missed a subtlety/got it complete wrong!"

The reason this can be confusing for US citizens is because people can get tried for the same thing again, but by a different court system.  For example, murder is typically be tried at a state level, but if the verdict is not guilty, it can go to a federal court (sometimes) where you can (and if you are there, you probably will) be found guilty.  I think."

I've never heard of someone being found not guilty and then tried again for the same crime at the federal level. My understanding is that it actually has to be a federal crime in order for someone to be tried that way.

Grey, you do realize  you're putting Yourself out there with these like 1000% more than I ever imagined you'd be comfortable with... You're no longer a detached auteur or a disembodied voice with a well researched script...  you're pretty much ""you the actual guy"".  And it's awesome, and thank you for putting yourself out there like this.  I know how uncomfortable this kind of exposure can be.  In terms of the content of the video, I of course don't ""agree"" with either you or Brady wholesale... because we're getting a little past the politics of media and ideas, and more into the philosophy of ""How now shall we live?""  And that latter question has as  many valid answers as there are people, and I've always found the best outlook on it is to borrow from everyone and subscribe to none.  In your case, I feel that your're overly intentional.  Which isn't a criticism, but more an unsolicited diagnosis of your particular strain of humanity... My buddy Jacob Clifton writes TV recaps over at Television Without Pity, and somewhere in a Farscape essay once he coined the phrase ""The thing that makes you awesome is always, always the thing that makes you suck. The cost of the wattage to light one bulb very much is missed in the spheres of the other three, but at the end of the day, we can never be the platonic form of Ourself, no matter how clearly we can conceptualize it, and how many clever strategies we concoct to ""Have it all.""  About the best I've ever managed to get to in terms of this stuff is ""Know yourself, do what's in front of you, don't be an asshole"".

CGPGrey,1xmsvz,tsgoten,10,Tue Feb 11 19:51:44 2014 UTC,"Your four light bulbs did not sit entirely well with me and I think I have figured out why.  Powering different parts of your life off of your limited production capacity implies a linear relationship between the power put in and the value you get out of that aspect. Much of the time, the relationship is going to be anything but linear.  In some cases, a small amount of energy placed in the bulb is not going to break the threshold of providing any value at all while in other cases the marginal value of additional energy at 25% might be huge while the marginal value of additional energy at 75% might be tiny.  Then there are the problems of dynamic effects where one bulb being at 30% or 40% can change the marginal value of additional energy for a bulb at 10%. Perhaps your additional time at work means making friends at work and now the energy of going out for drinks one night a weak gives higher returns than if you were going out for drinks with the now-alienated non-work friends.  Further complicating matters is the forced energy cost of neglecting aspects of one's life. If you neglect your family too much, the amount of energy you must expend to tolerate their presence or avoid them is non-optional.  Of course, all of these relationships are always changing, so if an optimal balance is achieved at one point in time, it is unlikely to last.  Additionally, there is an issue which you talked about, although not characterized this specifically, regarding the need to expend high levels of energy in order to build something expediently versus the amount of energy required to sustain. By temporarily under-powering some aspects of one's life one can sometimes excel in another in a way which can be sustained for some future period with a reasonable amount of energy. At least, that is what an awful lot of people tell themselves.  While I generally agree with your primary thesis that when most people are talking about work/life balance they are deluded in thinking that if they just re-jigger things a bit they can 'have it all', but I think that your example is over-simplified in a not-dissimilar way. The term 'balance' is extremely applicable to describe reducing power to a part of your life in order to power another in order to achieve an overall higher level of satisfaction.  This could all make an interesting sim game.  P.S. If you haven't tried it yet, Europa Universalis seems like a game which you could enjoy."

Meaning, each phase of our life determines which bulbs shine brightest.  For example, in our adolescent educational years, friendships tend to be a priority versus work, family, and health.  Therefore, we allocate more energy to shine that light the brightest.  This changes once we fall in love and marry.  Suddenly family is brighter along with our desire to provide, thus work gets wattage.  It changes again if you have kids and will cycle through the years until you reach a point that will allow your priorities to shift back towards your health and friends.  It's a brilliant analogy that is in constant change. I am enjoying these podcasts."

CGPGrey,1xmsvz,BobTheElephant,5,Tue Feb 11 20:33:05 2014 UTC,"Grey, did the fact that you've worked as a teacher for many years help you transition to being self-employed? I'm asking because when I grew up, my parents were teachers, and I was used to my mum doing quite a bit of her work in the evenings, especially making weekly plans and similar, so being a teacher is another one of those jobs where you can't entirely switch off your ""work lightbulb"" just because you go home for the day."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,rubberduck9,6,Tue Feb 11 20:57:35 2014 UTC,"Grey, did the fact that you've worked as a teacher for many years help you transition to being self-employed?   Definitely.  Big stretches of time without work were a huge attractor for me.     so being a teacher is another one of those jobs where you can't entirely switch off your ""work lightbulb"" just because you go home for the day.   Very true."

CGPGrey,1xmsvz,KontraMantra,6,Thu Feb 20 15:24:36 2014 UTC,"so... how about that ""end of January video""? XD my comment isn't about that, it's about this podcast.  I feel obligated to give you feedback and to express that I enjoy this podcast very much, and it has already became one of the weak.must.do that I have. I'll have to check that second episode again to get into audible and sign in.  But what made me comment was this episode content. I want to try and add to your theory. I think that you should try and make it more complex, and I would add 2 main changes:   The motor energy isn't fixed. The light-bolbs have a threshold.   I think that the motor energy isn't fixed, it depends on how healthy you are, how are your friend and family relations, and the results of your work. So, even though you said in the end that you couldn't make the same bursts of energy, i think that if you raise your health level, you'll be able to improve on that.  On the second bullet, I really think that if we completely turn off a light-bolb, we start to neglect some important things in life, ye can't turn of family, or your wife would leave you, and so on.  So my idea is, you must have 25W on each light-bulb, or everything starts to fail, and the rest of the power that you can produce, you can dedicate and distribute however.  On the being happy subject, I think that is way more complex and will only say that, we always look back to a saddest oneself, because we want to believe that our decisions in the meanwhile have improved our life.  And on the turning the lights completely off, I think that our daily routine is deeply influenced by our current activities, so it's really impossible to completely remove the plug. In the light-bulb analogy, we can turn the light down, but the bulb is still warm :P  EDIT: I belive my comment was referenced in episode 4 :D"
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,scarredxsounds,6,Wed Feb 12 02:20:19 2014 UTC,Well THIS is how I see it. I'm not so good in writing. EDIT: THIS is also important to it.
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,megmotherwort,3,Thu Feb 13 13:37:15 2014 UTC,"I'm adding my comment here because it is an extension upon the idea that ""the motor energy isn't fixed.""  It seems an error to assume that any person would have consistent power output over the course of his life. GCPGrey himself makes statements of “bursts of energy” which would contradict his full adoption of this assumption (despite the different contexts). I wouldn’t think it reasonable even to assume that power output were a function of age alone on the basis of the shakiness of the assumption that despite flagging health, a person would have the same power output unless we are adopting some sort of mind-body duality hypothesis.  So if we reject that hypothesis, we now find ourselves in the somewhat inconvenient situation that power output itself is a function of among other things health (be it mental, physical, social, etc.) and per the original construction, one of the outputs of the power function.  For love of matrices, I think we are venturing into the realm of Markov Chains so that's nice.  Though it may be alluring, I don’t think we can even assume that total energy spent across a lifetime is constant even ignoring untimely deaths. To defend this it seems necessary to consider accumulated advantage or even to abandon metaphoric energy altogether in favor of analyzing the caloric consumption and literal output of organisms.  While I think it could be done, I don’t have the energy to pursue patching the metaphor further because at least in my mind it very quickly becomes a heavily initial-condition-dependent, several variable simulation which presents little simplification.  I write this response as someone who all too often wants to reduce the complexity of life down to something resembling causal video games like the ones used as an escape by CGPGrey as though I could identify discrete events that have lead to where I am or at least impose some sort of fairness in the world. For me, such metaphors can easily lead to a lack of regard for others and even for myself in cases in which I don't feel particularly successful.  “We don't suffer from a shortage of metaphors, is what I mean. But you have to be careful which metaphor you choose, because it matters… The metaphors have implications…” - John Green"
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,KontraMantra,3,Wed Feb 12 03:21:19 2014 UTC,"I think that during the episode Grey talks about how he considers the average for a weak. If it's 8 work and 8 family, everyday, you'll get 50W on those light bulbs in average, and not spending the week doing 18h per day with family while doing work.   I think of it like an integral, that can be applied to any period of time. And from this period, we can adjust the metaphor and the conclusions taken.  Still, a burst of energy means more then 5 hours of ongoing work."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,HortonHearsAGenocide,3,Wed Feb 12 06:59:00 2014 UTC,"CGP, you make some great points. It made me think a lot about my current life. Thanks!"
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,yolomatic_swagmaster,2,Tue Feb 11 21:45:37 2014 UTC,"Me too, damn I work to much and I'm neglecting my family. I totally missed my brothers birthday because I was working, ugh.  Thou I know If I lower my energy input at this point, I will never be self sustaining (qua money)."

CGPGrey,1xmsvz,MuffledPancakes,5,Wed Feb 12 05:31:59 2014 UTC,"CGP, one problem I see with your four light bulbs argument is that you're treating the system as a zero-sum game, when in fact, it clearly isn't.  For example, imagine if you will a person who turns family, friends and health off and only leaves on work, all the time.  This leads to a classic scenario of burnout, ulcers, heart attacks or strokes, but even before that as a person's health degrades, their energy available for work will also degrade."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,mrparkourcat,3,Wed Feb 12 19:14:14 2014 UTC,Does your wife listen to these podcasts?
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,mrparkourcat,3,Thu Feb 13 14:47:48 2014 UTC,"I'm in college right now so my take may be a bit naive but I'm going for it.  Why not combine the groups? The simplest example is for you to workout with friends(or family)?   100 Units divided between 3 Groups: Friends/Health, Work and Family It's not ideal and doesn't allow someone to be great at everything but it is a step in the right direction.  Edit: I think each person can find many more combinations that fit them well."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,outofmayo,3,Sat Feb 15 04:30:51 2014 UTC,I quite like the calmness that has been in all of the podcast. specifically to this podcast: I really enjoy the mix of objective views and you personal opinions and relations to the subject. At the first quarter of the podcast you seemed to be going around in a circle a bit. Overall a really nice podcast with an interesting subject.  :)
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,Salavora,3,Tue Feb 11 20:57:45 2014 UTC,"At one point you said that regretting not doing something in one aspect of your life (one lightbulb) could erode the quality of your decisions (or was it satisfaction?) in another aspect. Could you elaborate on that? I don't quite get the way you divided your life into lighbulbs. First, it seems to me you could lump both ""Family"" and ""Friends"" into one bulb, say ""Social life"". Of course, you don't (always) spend time with your family and friends at the same time, but I don't see a reason why those two should be divided. Also, why does ""Health"" have a separate lightbulb? The divide that first comes to my mind is: ""Work"", ""Free time"" and ""Social life"" So ""Work"" is developing the ideas, recording, editing, etc. ""Free time"" are your hobbies: gaming, exercising (so ""Health"" would fall under this bulb), photography, etc. ""Social life"" is hanging out with your friends and family."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,HyruleSpy,3,Tue Feb 11 23:24:07 2014 UTC,"In regard to your second question/comment, I immediately formed a similar argument. ""Where would hobbies and 'alone-time' be categorized?"", I thought. But the more I considered what was really going on behind each of my activities, the more I'm convinced those 4 categories are really quite adept at compartmentalizing life.  For example, my hobby of playing piano and singing are for the sake of my mental sanity (health). My video games are both a social interaction (friends) and a way to relax (health).   In regards to why family and friends are different, I personally think friends refer to anyone with whom you have common interests or enjoy doing activities together with. But family refers to the people with whom you have a future; the family bulb has many more difficult and impactful decisions. Family both includes parents and in-laws; it includes your wife/husband and boy/girlfriend too. So 'Social Life' is a bit all-encompassing to be a good measure. You may for example spend 50% of your energy going out with friends and having fun with a very poor family commitment."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,metjush,2,Wed Feb 12 17:05:45 2014 UTC,On eroding the quality of future decisions- here is an excellent Radiolab episode about this:  http://www.radiolab.org/story/91641-how-much-is-too-much/

I have surely not done as much research as you but i have discussed it with two national gymnastics coaches who seem to disagree with this decision to go carb free (glucose free). Ruffly saying that it is less beneficial for their athletes to eat that way. I personally don't believe a diet like this is very sustainable and is only a short term fix, rather then turning up the health light bulb. imo would cut red meat and junk food and just be moderate."

Interesting topics, I like to listen to Grey and Brady anyway, so this is reeeaaaaly nice g The dynamic is also quite interesting, since both can explain quite well I think and are able to make good arguments for or against a case and also appear to try and see someone elses view. What got me laughing was near the end of the third, when grey talked about games to be able to concentrate on something besindes work. I am currently playing prison architect and listen to stuff (like podcasts or fantasy-audiobooks), while playing to wind down, so I could understand his point quite well. Then he said, that he liked sim-like games where you build stuff and manage it. (loved civ4, Age of Empires II, Dungeon Keeper2, Master of Olympus – Zeus (which is only in german as far as I know) and right now: Prison architect) Since I stumbled over prison architect I was thinking at the time I listend to the podcast: ""Heh, I should recommend this game to him, it's fun and he might like it!"" And then he said, that he is playing it as well and this just cracked me up ^   Grey, if you read this: What are your all-time favourite mangement-sims and what is in your current top 3?  Edit: Zeus is availabe in english as well, if you are interested: http://www.amazon.com/Master-Olympus-Zeus-Poseidon-Exp-Pc/dp/B0018V7O7C/ref=sr_1_1?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1392234265&sr=1-1&keywords=Zeus"

CGPGrey,1xmsvz,Techsanlobo,3,Thu Jun 12 04:36:11 2014 UTC,"@4 light bulbs: what about diminishing marginal returns? if light bulbs don't convert your input one-to-one, but follow a sort of concave output function, then the optimal distribution would be much more equal.  is that a realistic assumption? I think so. as you say often, the cost of perfectionism is infinite - the more you work on something, the less of an improvement an extra hour is going to make. so following some sort of a 80/20 rule would be optimal rather than devoting 100% to one light bulb.  also, thinking about light bulbs as completely independent may be slightly misleading. poor health will/may eventually affect your work output for example. and this is not just that you are not putting input into the health lightbulb, but that the fact it is not shining over time decreases the maximum output of your other lightbulbs."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,HyruleSpy,2,Thu Feb 13 08:57:45 2014 UTC,"Also, some lightbulbs' activities recharge one's energy rather than exclusively depleting it."

E,g,, putting lots of effort into health good also be effort as family - such as exercising with wife and kids (jogging, bike riding, playing sports...etc,), having healthy meals together, etc.? - so things don't necessarily always add up to 100W?  2) There can also be wastage! I can spend a day of wasted effort, moping around, putting effort into nothing. I suppose this is like inefficiency in physics (light being lost as heat, etc.) - so the four bulbs can add up to at most 100W."

And the next day, feeling guilty about not keeping up with social connections, make dinner plans with a friend after work, then go to the gym and go to sleep. After that however, I would feel I'm neglecting my girlfriend, text her a bunch even during work (how now! arrest this gentleman!), come home to make dinner and hopefully attend to her every need before going to bed (only to not get any sleep worrying about an upcoming deadline).

Not so much a light bulb, but maybe an empty socket, where the electricity dissipates into the air (Ok, so that's not how light bulb sockets work, but you get the idea).  This fifth one includes things such as video games, reddit, sleeping in, or spending three hours playing with your cat. Essentially, wasted electricity.  I think it's important to recognize this one, because that's where the electricity goes for many people, especially if you consider time=potential, then it's a huge drain.

I definitely have issues 'turning off' the grad school bulb when I'm doing other things.  It's incredibly difficult because I'm also not having the greatest time in grad school and so because I'm perpetually behind, I always feel incredibly guilty for not doing work at a single moment.  So my 'off times' are manufactured to be as distracting as possible.  So I will be redditing, watching a TV show, and knitting at the same time.  Not even joking.  I'm attempting to engage all of my mind so I can just stop thinking about all of the stuff I have to do, all of the things I'm doing wrong, etc."

CGPGrey,1xmsvz,mabolle,2,Fri Feb 14 15:03:05 2014 UTC,"Feedback: I think that the conversations that the two of you (I know you're reading this) have are excellent, and the ways your minds work in a logical sense are incredibly interesting and (I want to emphasize this but I don't know how to italicize on reddit) valuable ways of speaking about difficult issues. It feels both new and old, because you utilize the classic tools of great interviewing and conversation (and make no mistake, there are tools for that sort of thing) but also present a modern style of thinking, wherein you assume a level of intelligence in your audience, or perhaps you assume the ability of the Internet to allow your audience to pause and inform themselves when they come upon something they don't understand. I am more grateful for this than you can imagine, as much of our public discourse seems to either ignore the fact that a great majority of people are far smarter than content-producers think they are or (and query whether this is worse) ignore the fact that their audience can easily google the topic of conversation and bring themselves up to speed or verify anything that feels out of place.   All that said, I think there is a foundation problem, and I mean that in the sense of the foundation of a house. There is obviously a reason that the two of you know one another and there is obviously a reason why people have found your content: they already know you (most likely) from your YouTube exploits. As I follow those exploits, this is not a problem for me. However, moving forward, I can see a possible dissonance between the obvious rapport and chemistry that the two of you have (and which makes your podcast wonderful to listen to) and the casual observer who has come to the podcast because of the podcast, without seeing or reading anything else you've done. There is a potential for Hello Internet to become an insider's game if you don't lay a proper groundwork on each issue you approach, in that you have perhaps assumed too much intelligence on the part of a listener about the views that you espouse and where they come from. This feels like part of what you are trying to address at the beginning of episode three, and so I am optimistic about the future, I just wanted to make the point."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,Tolly12,2,Fri Feb 14 15:27:38 2014 UTC,"Quick comment before I post a thoughtful one, but I just wanted to say how I appreciate the minimal style of the podcast. No 90 audio bumpers, simple sponsorship ads (which keeps it free for us, much appreciated!), and no breaks. 30 uninterrupted minutes of pure, unadulterated, awesome podcasting. I've devoured the first three episodes in just yesterday, and I'm looking forward to today's. Great work!"
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,rwired,2,Fri Feb 14 16:05:46 2014 UTC,"CGP: I feel like you're forgetting that you have friends through your work. On the flip side, you're also forgetting that the idea of ""health"" has to encapsulate too much (in your framework) to just be one lightbulb, because it feels like you are tying physical - and only physical - health to a very broad category, or ignoring others like mental health or just the idea of the development of the self."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,jpecon,2,Fri Feb 14 16:59:41 2014 UTC,"Les to do with the main topic of the podcast, but one of the earlier bits of the conversation here that resonated for me were your comments about ""The People Vs George Lucas"".  A few years back, I was part of a documentary about a LARP (live action roleplaying game) based out of Washington (state).  It was interesting to see the reactions from the other participants when the movie was released and made its way around the indie film circuit.  Most of the people that had shied away from the cameras and generally anticipated a negative portrayal of their hobby largely focused in on a couple of the other players that were featured in the film, largely because they reinforced the stereotype that the more camera-shy players worried about.  So, in some fashion, I felt like their worries produced a self-fulfilling prophecy.  I felt that the director treated people fairly - they didn't take anyone out of context, and presented people for who they were.  But watching the film left many people with the same feeling of unease that you described in watching ""TPvGL"" - a self-reflection that preyed on the fears of their own mental image of themselves.  So, yeah... I suppose that's a long way of me saying ""I heard that"". ;)"
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,amildenb,2,Fri Feb 14 20:50:02 2014 UTC,"I really like the lightbulb analogy; it reminds me a bit of the spoon theory for people living with chronic illness.   Which brings up a related point. The idea that completely ignoring a light bulb may eventually cause the total amount of energy you have to devote to the four light bulbs to decrease was sort of touched on in the podcast. It's most obvious if someone completely ignores the health light bulb because poor diet, sleep habits, etc. leads to less energy, but it's true of any of the bulbs. e.g. Ignoring the work bulb (unless you're independently wealthy) leads to undo stress over bills and prevents one from spending energy on the other bulbs.  But I don't think this is a system where one solely expends energy (or leaches energy when the balance is very skewed). People can get a return on their energy investment. Mission driven people (who work someplace where they agree with the mission) get energy from devoting themselves to their jobs. Social people get energy from investing in their friends. Etc.  And that's where life/work balance comes in. The goal is to balance the energy distribution to your light bulbs in such a way that you're getting the best bang for your buck. Work energizes you? Devote a lot of your energy to it, but only to the point where sacrificing your health won't end up costing you more than you're gaining back from the work. Feel best when you're hanging with your friends? Only put enough energy into the work bulb so that you aren't stressed about paying your bills which would pull focus from your friends and maybe have enough extra to buy a round at the pub occasionally."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,Arko1K,2,Sat Feb 15 03:49:04 2014 UTC,"I really have a problem with the health light bulb. If you're smart, you can get that lightbulb to shine at maybe 50% by no effort at all. It's all about small changes in the daily life, not anything drastic.   Not feeling guilty about eating something unhealthy does NOT turn of the lightbulb completely. To elaborate, if your health light bulb was at 100% (olympic athlete?) and you decide to stop caring about health, you will still be healtier than most of the population. So maybe you eat a bit worse, but from an outside point of view your still at 70% health.  Maybe that's a problem with the analogy as a whole. By making better choices you can get more than 100 watts of light from your 100 watts of power."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,Arko1K,2,Sat Feb 15 14:36:29 2014 UTC,"I agree with the overall analogy.  I certainly have felt the strain of trying to keep all four bulbs bright throughout my life and dissatisfaction with the results.  In the past, combining the friend bulb with the health (exercise) bulb has helped some.  Your analogy is nice because it adds an element of deliberateness to the choice about where one puts their energy."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,robopancake,2,Sat Feb 15 15:56:24 2014 UTC,"This episode should probably be renamed ""How to be a workaholic and not completely ruin your life"".

CGPGrey,1xmsvz,TransitRanger_327,2,Mon Feb 17 15:55:44 2014 UTC,"First of all, I'm extremely pleased with this podcast. Being a teenager, I am consistently surrounded by stupid arguments between people. There is something extremely refreshing about two grown men whom I respect stating their stances on an issue and discussing it in a completely pleasant and respectful manner. Of course there is constant disagreement, but the opposition never comes with harsh words or ill intent. This podcast is very thought provoking, and very pleasant to listen to. I'm glad the two of you decided to so this! Now, on to the meat of this comment. I do not agree entirely with the lightbulb analogy for one key reason. It is very possible to have energy spent in, say, health also help, say, your work lightbulb. This is especially obvious when considering a career path like professional athleticism. To such a career, health and work are nearly the same. If you eat right, you're helping your work, and while you're working you're improving your health. In this way, it's almost as if you now only have three light bulbs to worry about. This is somewhat of an extreme example, but the effect is visible in a smaller scale. If, for example, you commit yourself to going to the gym with a beloved family member once per week, you have helped both your family and health lightbulbs with only a little more energy than you would've spent on health in the first place. In this way, you can ""cheat,"" and really output greater than 100W. I would bet that if you asked very successful people how they became so successful, many would cite integrating friends and family within their business, such that their focus on work would also be pleasurable for them and maintain their relationships. Anyway, that's just my thoughts on the matter. All in all, a very well put-together podcast. I will continue listening for sure!"
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,gtcompscientist,2,Mon Feb 17 16:35:00 2014 UTC,"I like your analogy of 4 light bulbs to govern aspects of your life. But where would you put recreation or community activities? Somebody may be really involved with their local community/service/volunteer club such as Rotary, Lions."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,Joeisthinking,2,Mon Feb 17 18:15:56 2014 UTC,"I believe there are X factors that the Four bulbs forget.  Personal Happiness(sanity), Income levels, as well as many other small things.  I work in a kitchen, and I know for a fact I put in twice the hours a programmer, or tech support will in any given week, on average.  I know for a fact that I put a lot of my energy into family, and work, and keep a decent social life as well.  my 0% on my health turns negative with the stresses I put on my body with running and moving for 10-16 hours a day6 days a week, if i am lucky.  sometimes the energy levels come for the skills you inherently have, or the station you are born into.  sometimes it comes from the training you endure as you get older, sometimes from the tricks you learn to deal with the hassles."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,mm11wils,2,Wed Feb 19 04:33:00 2014 UTC,"Love these podcasts, love CGPGrey and Brady's channels, but honestly the podcast doesn't start until 11:00. The first 11 minutes are corrections and ads. Kind of a bad ratio when the whole podcast is 50 mins."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,Talshere,2,Wed Feb 19 07:44:27 2014 UTC,I like the analogy of the light bulbs and expending energy to different aspects of your life.  The problem now is that I imagine light bulbs glowing brighter and dimmer as i change tasks.  My life is now ruled by light bulbs...

CGPGrey,1xmsvz,tolkienfan4ever,2,Wed Feb 19 17:10:29 2014 UTC,"The four light bulbs analogy drives me crazy because Grey made a glaring omission: Efficiency.  Its maddening because the advert for Square Space mentioned this very issue.  He spoke about how he would code his own websites and how Square Space simplified it.  In a previous episode he also talked about how he has a macro to fill out YouTube forms, all of which are examples of efficiency in action. The question was posed about how successful people succeed and have it all.  I suspect efficiency of work, collaboration and recognising what tasks can be delegated are a large part of the answer.  When it was mentioned Brady has made over 2000 videos, it wasn't mentioned that he doesn't make this content alone.  He has many collaborators such as Professor Poliakoff and Dr James Grime.  I strongly suspect CGPGrey does not have the same collaboration.  The entire conversation about not trusting sources of information may in fact extend to not trusting humans for the same reason.  Just a thought.  I really want Grey and Brady to talk about efficiencies they have instituted to increase productivity.  It has been hinted at and I would love it expanded."
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,dduroc,2,Wed Feb 19 23:15:31 2014 UTC,"Loving the podcast. This episode in particular was very enlightening, and personal in a good way, and may well help me figure some stuff out.  What I'd be interested in is a discussion of how the performances of the different light bulbs affect one another. For example, if my friend bulb runs low enough - meaning e.g. that I don't find time to talk to my friends enough about things going on in my life - I start to find that affecting the glow of my health bulb, simply from carrying around so many unprocessed thoughts that it becomes psychologically/emotionally taxing.  I mean, I can't not have friends or a family. It'd make me ill. So in that sense, it's not just about making a decision about how far you'll allow the wattage of any one bulb to drop, but also about how far you can let it drop before the other bulbs are affected. Or am I now ruining the analogy?"
CGPGrey,1xmsvz,tenthz,2,Thu Feb 20 11:11:22 2014 UTC,"Analogy is such a terrific tool for thought and such a poor tool for argument. In this case it is a great way to look at living your life in a different way than maybe you do or would. I really enjoyed this episode and it gave me pause to think about which lights I might have on and how bright.  However, I think it is strange that people seem to want to take an analogy and keep expanding it to find fallacy in it. Well, real light bulbs work this way and what does that mean for the thing you are comparing and so it doesn't fit perfectly and thus you must be wrong for using it. Clearly the points you make aren't valid because you didn't take into account all these other things. Motors do this. What if there are five areas instead of four? What if the circuit they are on has resistors? What if every time you turn on a light bulb someone kills a spider? How come you haven't thought about that?"

CGPGrey,1xmsvz,kevinrhansenjr,2,Fri Feb 28 10:45:32 2014 UTC,"First of all, I just finished catching up on the first 5 episodes, and I have to say that I love them. It's refreshing to hear a more relaxed, conversational style CGPGrey and hearing more from Brady than I feel like I usually get in the Numberphile videos.   Secondly, I had a question about some types of activities and where you would put them as far as your four bulbs go. Pursuant to a comment from Brady in Ep. #5, I looked through the comments for this question first, but I couldn't find it (or got too lazy to continue reading comments), so I'm just going to ask. As far as hobbies go (for those of us not pursuing our passion as a money making job or those that have enough hobbies to spread over broad enough interests that they couldn't all be considered ""work""), would you put those into health (i.e., they keep me sane)? Obviously athletic hobbies would go under the health bulb, but what about, say, knitting, painting, rebuilding old cars, etc.?  Thirdly, I also totally get the conscious decision making as far as delegating time to/from specific bulbs. I also recently redistributed my own bulbs after coming off of 6 months where I made the choice to not put a ton of effort into the health bulb. Due to a series of trips, purchasing our first house, and a number of other things, we made the decision to take a break from the low carb lifestyle we'd been on for two years. While now I'm sad that I have lost some of the progress that I made in the two years prior (as far as weight loss and overall fitness), the lack of stress from trying to maintain all the things at once was worth it (at least for the most part). Brady mentioned a few times that just because you've made the decision, it doesn't take away the detrimental aspects of that decision, which is of course, true, but I believe it's off point. The point as I see it is that if you don't consciously make the decision, things may or probably will still happen that change the amounts you're putting into each bulb; then, in addition to, say, working out less/eating worse, you get the stress of feeling guilty about that as well. Whereas, if I make the decision that I'm not going to worry about how I eat for six months, I get the negative physical side effects, but overall, I'm happier about life because I'm not stressing about the diet.  Granted I'm fatter now than I wanted to be, but my mental health is actually better than it would have been otherwise. Perhaps, by making the decision to put less into a physical health bulb, you really kept your mental health bulb at a better level.  Finally, on the low-carb lifestyle, you might be interested in checking out Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes (available on Audible). For a quicker listen with the same type of information, check out Why We Get Fat (same author, also on Audible). Good luck!  --Edited for typos. -_-"

But i think you are missing one light bulb, useless light bulb that just drain your battery and you gain nothing from. You would categorize f.e. world of Warcraft where you can be spending a large amount of time and energy getting your epic mage to its full potential even when you are working you are thinking about this and that, or when you are binge watching tv, reading books and what not... or this can be the relax light bulb witch charges your sanity when you put low energy in too it and overtake your live when you put to much energy in to it.

CGPGrey,1xavrm,jaudette,22,Tue Mar 4 22:03:50 2014 UTC,"I'd choose the world with zero copyright, but that might be because i have a different perspective than you, Grey. I'm a wikipedian. A lot of the images we use are in the public domain. It's already hard to find good images to support the articles as is. I mean for crying out loud, some images from 1930 are still in copyright. So infinite copyright would just be an enormous setback."
CGPGrey,1xavrm,amphicoelias,9,Fri Feb 7 23:17:21 2014 UTC,I find zero copyright to also be more preferable than infinite. While zero might not give birth to any expensive projects at least it will keep new things coming. When using infinite copyright I would think that the copyright space would eventually get so filled that nothing could be made.
CGPGrey,1xavrm,DraculBloodaxe,3,Wed Feb 12 22:06:39 2014 UTC,"While zero might not give birth to any expensive projects at least it will keep new things coming.    I have an argument for why it would - principally, because you still have scarcity in the creative process, then you have vectors for monetization or at least funding.  I can't imagine if by some otherworldly alien body snatchers taking over the US congress tomorrow the reaction if they abolished copyright that day, but I do know people have tasted ""big budget"" creative works, and would want more.  I easily see a lot of the revenue currently being paid to Netflix / theater tickets / cable companies going to exa-scale kickstarters with some more mainstream legal protections more akin to investment. The difference is you don't invest for potential return on investment, you invest for eventual created ideas.  We don't see that now because so much capital is locked up in the for-profit artificial distribution limitation of the current regime.  But I do see the counterpoint as well - without copyright, you suddenly would have a hundred years of variable quality works to consume without impediment. The demand for new works would considerably decline when you have all the existent works to consume.  Which I guess is also somewhat good. Isn't it wasteful for people not to utilize the ideas formed by those a half century ago, if they are still perfectly viable for purpose but are just lost to the copyright bottomless hole? Why need new media at all if you have many lifetimes worth to sate you? And if you don't have anything left, you can just pay creative people to make more. So demand would absolutely still be there, but new creative ventures with new IP would require a lot more effective marketing of the idea to get people to fund it versus Star Wars Episode 572."
CGPGrey,1xavrm,Xanny,1 point,Thu Feb 13 14:53:24 2014 UTC,"I am of the same agreement for the same reason. The moment I heard infinite copyright I pictured a rich corporation buying up the rights to every type of story and compiling a library of types of stories that could never be told again. The monomyths, creation stories, stories that involve the end of universes and worlds. Genre elements like aliens and time travel or noir private eyes. Though this is all thinking that in a world with infinite copyright, copyright holders would eventually push to copyright more and more fundamental things such as story elements."

CGPGrey,1xavrm,IndoctrinatedCow,3,Thu Feb 20 00:18:36 2014 UTC,"It should be pretty simple: start a high quality recorder, start a VoIP (Skype or whatever they use) session, and whoever's in charge of editing it together collects the hi-q file from the other guy after.  Slap them in an audio program, sync up, export, publish, done.  Aside from the recording time, that should cost the editor less than 5 minutes of work.  I've learned from trying to combine e.g. video and audio from two different cameras, an interesting issue arises: even if the formats are identical (e.g. both 44100 samples per second) the timing crystals aren't perfectly identical and in a long recording will drift out of sync, making the editor's job harder.  I'm not sure if this is a problem for them or if the programs they use to record include some sort of automatic syncing.  In my case I learned what the drift rate was and wrote a script to automatically adjust one of them to match the other.  Either way I suspect the amount of manual work that the editor needs to do for other reasons -- cutting stuff they later decide shouldn't be in there, etc. -- dwarfs this particular problem."

CGPGrey,1xavrm,DCPatentAtty,7,Wed Apr 2 13:39:24 2014 UTC,"When Grey says a lot of people thought his video was advocating a world with zero copyright, and Brady says that's how he interpreted it, I was really surprised.  I thought Grey's intent was pretty clear: copyright should be limited to a certain number of years- like his example of the original 28 years. My main issue with that video was where he said,    Because, exactly who needs incentives after they're dead? Dead is the point at which literally no incentives in the whole universe can motivate you to write one more screenplay. Because you're dead.  If you're the kind of person who is only motivated by plans that unravel after your demise, you're either amazingly awesome or deranged.   Well, I should think that post-mortem incentives do matter to quite a few non-deranged creators.  Probably not J.K. Rowling (his example) when she began to write Harry Potter at 25.  The example that comes immediately to my mind was Ulysses S. Grant.  He had lost all his money to a Ponzi scheme and had been diagnosed with throat cancer when someone offered to pay for a newspaper article about the war.  They were popular enough that he realized he could make money off his memoirs to pay his debts and provide for his family after his death.  He worked through constant pain and finished five days before he died.  Of course, that's the most extreme example imaginable, but I'm sure many older or ill creators have been interested in providing for their families with royalties after they die.  That being said, this was a very good discussion.  Part of me thinks we'd be better off with a limited copyright of say, 30-50 years, without tying it to the life off the author at all, but then I think it would really suck to be that guy who's work goes unappreciated until he's an old man and it goes into public domain.  Maybe 50 years or the life of the author, whichever is longer?  And part of me would like to see different copyright lengths for different media.  It seems to me like videogames should go into the public domain after 20 years.  De facto, they do-given all the NES and Supernintendo clones there are out there, or how many Atari clones were already available in the '90s.  The state of the art advances so quickly that 20 years is forever.  But 20 years seems inappropriately short for a book."
CGPGrey,1xavrm,Omni314,2,Sat Feb 8 06:37:42 2014 UTC,"I agree, tying copyright to the creator's death seems a bit wrong. From a cynical point of view, it possibly gives an incentive to kill someone.  I think it should extend past death. Say a creator makes something late in life and creates a charitable foundation funded by the revenue from the work. To have that charity dry-up after just a few years because the creator died doesn't seem right to me."
CGPGrey,1xavrm,bsparks,5,Tue Feb 11 18:40:47 2014 UTC,"I think 100 years is far to high of a limit.  One criteria for copyright length should also be the potential for derivative works and the value of those efforts to society. Many people may have great ideas for derivative works, but they can't afford royalties or are unable to convince the creator to allow derivative works. I think it would be a shame for copyright to prevent them from ever working on their ideas.  So copyright length would need to be no more than ~20 years or so.  However, another possibility would be to loosen copyright over time. For example: * After 10 years, the creator may not deny derivative works and must publicize royalty rates and partners, licensing at the same rate for each category of media.  Or maybe copyright law should specify the rates and decrease them over time? But this quickly becomes a logistical nightmare with arguments over the rates and how they decrease.  I like the idea of a copyright that phases out over time, but unfortunately, deciding the mechanism just complicates the debate."

CGPGrey,1xavrm,macklemost_,2,Tue Feb 11 18:58:05 2014 UTC,"Back in 2005, there was a bill introduced to the US Congress called ""The Public Domain Enhancement Act"" http://beta.congress.gov/bill/109th/house-bill/2408  It proposed allowing for a 50 year copyright of a published work with the option to renew the copyright for additional 10 years increments there after for a nominal fee of $1.   The idea was that after 50 years, most things are no longer considered commercially viable and would be allowed to slip into public domain.  It would allow Disney to keep Micky Mouse and yet allow more obscure titles to laps.  I really like the idea, but it has been 9 years and hasn't gotten anywhere.  An idea I've toyed around with would be to see a user funded publisher who's express purpose would be to facilitate purchasing works to place them under creative commons.  Users could set a series of preferences for titles they would like to see liberated and pitch in whatever they feel would be worth it.    So as a user you could pitch in say $50 and set their preferences: Title A: Star Wars Title B: Wizard of Oz Title C: Taxi Driver Title D: Evil Dead/Army of Darkness  Obviously Star Wars would probably be ""Title A"" for a bunch of people and the bounty would be fairly high, but probably not high enough for Disney to sell it.  But because they have multiple choices Title C might be something that is still fairly popular and have a bounty suitably large enough to entice the current copyright holder to sell.  Once a title is sold, the user would have to top off their funding pool."

CGPGrey,1xavrm,frenchthehaggis,4,Fri Feb 7 22:40:45 2014 UTC,"IAAL and a big CGP fan. I think about this every time I see his work appropriated. There are a couple reasons why his approach is actually the best way to handle these things.  (Not that you asked, of course, but here it is.) 1) Reputation. Asking politely makes you seem like the most reasonable person in the eyes of the public. All of us (lawyers included) fantasize about sending a ""Hey $$&&//;, I'll rip your skull off if you don't respect my work"" message. That email always gets out and the author always looks crazy after the fact. 2) Lawyers are expensive. Copyright lawyers are more expensive than your average lawyer. It turns out that wills, divorces and probate are pretty easy. You can do any of them with a stack of forms and a photocopier. Not so with copyright: The laws are a lot more nuanced and they are constantly being (re)defined by the courts. You need a specialist, not your cousin Vinny. Even if you hire one, you run the risk of having your lawyer's aggressive tactics coming back on you. (See 1, s/you/your lawyer/g.) 3) Successful action is not a  deterrent. This should be obvious, but there's no discussion board where infringers get together and exchange best practices. Say you get civil (or possibly criminal penalties) against Ian the Infringer. Ian sees the light and closes down his channel. The rest if the Internet doesn't care - it's as if he didn't exist at all.   The long and the short of it is that for small producers, the costs (aggravation, fiscal, reputation) rarely outweigh the benefits. This is why companies form around finding and developing works of copyright - record companies, studios, etc.  The only way to do it efficiently is to aggregate costs and profits.   tldr; Enforcement is a headache for everyone - especially the little guy."

Brady, from you in particular I got the sense that retelling stories cheapens either the original and/or the retelling, or is piggy backing on the fame of the original (so therefore is lazy). Which may or may not be true. But it's also the backbone of most of the Western Canon. The idea of the original novel is very much a Romantic invention. I won't try to provide an exhaustive list, though there's a pretty good one here, but quickly, almost everything of Shakespeare's is lifted from other sources, and Virgil's Aeneid is just a retelling of Homer's Iliad focusing on a different character.  Copyright should protect from plagiarism, but right now it's also stifling storytelling."

(Of course, I think the American Godzilla with Matthew Broderick is a great movie, so what do I know?)  For what it's worth, when I first watched your copyright video, I was left with the impression that certain corporations are ""abusing"" the idea of copyright in an effort to make even more money, despite the fact that the people in charge of such companies are already bazillionaires.  While I do understand the importance of copyright, I do think it has allowed people to be overly tight-fisted about their content for the wrong reasons.  Regarding the expiration of copyright, one of the things that I've been mildly fascinated by is the stuff that gets put up on Gutenberg.org.  While naturally it has several of the classics that have been in the public domain for quite a while, they have begun adding early Golden Age science fiction as it enters the public domain, such as the Barsoom series and magazine serials like Astounding Stories of Super Science#A), which is currently being published as Analog.  While I highly doubt anyone is itching to make a movie about a mad scientist that uses giant beetles found under Antarctica to take over the world, I do wonder what possibilities are now available as these stories start hitting the public domain.

One song from it inspired Edward Albee to write his play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? in 1962. Despite the fact that the composer of the song has been dead for over 70 years, theater companies producing the play still have to license ""Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?"" from Disney, or have the actors sing a different melody from the public domain, thus killing the pun which is central to the play's genesis. When Warner Brothers made a film version, they were unable to secure the rights, so Elizabeth Taylor sang the lines to the tune of ""Here We Go 'Round The Mulberry Bush""."
CGPGrey,1xavrm,ClevrUsername,2,Sat Feb 8 23:36:05 2014 UTC,"TL;DR: the copyright period should be shortened because of the principles of liberal democracy; specifically because of the imperative of minimization of the use of regulatory power.  In episode 3 you say you were once again not happy with your anti-copyright arguments and found them to be unconvincing. It seems you find it hard to put your thoughts on copyright into a well-structured argument. Here is my attempt at turning your thoughts, as I understand them, into such an argument:  I think your main qualm about copyright is that it's too long. You recognize that copyright serves to motivate and reward creators, but you think that there's ""no need"" to make the copyright period so long. This sounds sensible, but why does this mean that we should shorten copyright? That is the main hole in your argument, imo.  Why does the ""lack of need"" to make the copyright period long mean that we must make it short? The answer is liberal democracy. A liberal democracy strives to achieve its goals while limiting the citizens as little as possible. This is why a court has to be sure beyond reasonable doubt that people are guilty before giving a guilty verdict, and why liberal democracies put significant restrictions on the government's use of its eminent domain powers. This ""minimization of regulation"" principle (I assume political scientists have a name for this) is why copyright must be as short as possible. If the country decides that the intellectual rights of an author are fulfilled by a 20-year copyright term, and if that country is a liberal democracy, then this country must decide that 20 years is the correct length for copyright, since it strives to limit the citizenry as little as possible.  I think that's the argument you were trying to make.  Another thing I think was problematic with the discussion in Episode 2 is your shying away from making parallels between the ethics of copyright and the ethics of patents. You talked about the two being somewhat similar, but I think you didn't go far enough. I'd like to claim that copyright and patents are basically the same thing as far as ethics is concerned. In both of them, the state grants a creator a time-restricted monopoly on the things she created, and this is meant to encourage future creators, financially and otherwise. Yes, in one case the object created is content, and in the other case it is an idea, but I don't actually see a difference between the two: an idea is a piece of content, and vice versa.  You allude to the strong parallel between copyright and patents when you discuss the social significance of derivative work: you explain very well why no piece of literature comes out of thin air, and why literature is always based on previous literature. You give the example of the movie Clueless and reference Everything is a Remix. You just shy away from stating the conclusion: that any text contains many pieces of ""technology"" (call it, say, artistic technology). If this technology was in the realm of engineering, Patent law would apply to it. Since it's at the memetic realm, copyright applies to it. But at the basis, they're one of the same. Sartre was an inventor of Existentialist memetic technology, just like Steve Jobs created a social piece of content, embodied in the iPhone.  Why, then, are patents and copyright treated differently? Partly for historical reasons. And partly, I believe, because our society puts a premium on Engineering over Art and Artistic Memetics. So society finds it more important to allow derivative work on an AIDS drug after 20 years, than to allow derivative work on a Star Wars movie after 20 years, even thought both are innovations to human kinds and there is no reason to differentiate between the two."

So in almost any commercial context everyone tends to be very conservative as they don't want to risk their investment on the even slight chance that they may lose a suite down the road. So cases where it's almost assured that the case would be fair use (real world examples: documentaries with a few seconds of The Simpsons on in the background and where someone's ring tone was a pop song) end up either having to pay large royalty fees (10k+) or simply cutting the footage. This leads to a nasty catch-22 where nobody with enough cash to survive a court case will take the risk so the edges of 'fair use' remain very fuzzy."

Would the US court test be: ""Would using the opening note of the Star Wars Theme in a video prevent someone feeling the need to go and watch the Star Wars film."" (which is what's suggested in the podcast). or, would it be: ""Would using the opening note of the Star Wars Theme in a video prevent someone feeling the need to go and buy the Star Wars soundtrack.""?  It's a small distinction in the context of one note - but might be more important in the context of one bar (or measure to those who speak American), or the opening passage or the whole song. It'd be hard to argue that the opening section detracts from the whole film - but it would definitely detract from the pull of the soundtrack, since it is one of (if not the only) notable track from the soundtrack. If the former test is a harder one to satisfy, but could elicit a higher damage award if it was proved. The latter is easier to satisfy, but would lead to a lower award (since the film would make much more than the soundtrack).  I ask since in a youtube context, the 2nd test could be more crippling for a creator than the 1st.  Any damages award could conceivably be high enough to completely mitigate any ad revenue from a video regardless of the test used, but the 2nd one would be easier to satisfy - so would be more common, requiring more wariness from any Star-Ward-Theme-Tune-User, perhaps stifling Star Wars themed content."

Yes they may have helped fund it but ultimately they wouldn't have been able to make it without the creator, take Michael Jackson's music for example, I think that should be made public domain, maybe not straight after death, but pretty soon after. This website I think helps illustrate the point link"

CGPGrey,1xavrm,maxblasdel,1 point,Wed Feb 12 15:59:00 2014 UTC,I feel like this podcast didn't quite clearly go in on the idea of having to look at each sector that copyright laws have to deal with and depending on how fast the sector evolves it should have other time limits.  There is also the problem of abuse of patents. In the Software industry there are often many patents for even the stupidest and smallest things. There are even those we call patent trolls which is also not mentioned in this video although it being a serious problem in this subject.
CGPGrey,1xavrm,citanaF_Fanatic,1 point,Wed Feb 12 22:22:17 2014 UTC,"First something that I was surprised wasn't mentioned: The first Sherlock Holmes books have been ruled to enter the public domain.  Second, some perhaps less popular views that I just feel the need to express: I watched the Robert Downey Jr versions of Sherlock Holmes, just because they had RDJ in them, I was hesitant to watch something called Sherlock Holmes until I noticed RDJ was in it. But as a result of having watched these movies, which may give a different perspective on Sherlock Holmes than the books do, I am now more open to other things with the SH theme, which is how I discovered Sherlock (the TV series).  Then there is Star Wars, where I find myself generally liking the prequels more than the originals. The reason for this is likely to be that when I first saw the originals (or clips of the originals) I was way too young to understand what was going on in the movie, and it didn't really make any impression on me, then came the prequels, with better image quality and more fancy effects, and those movies made much more of an impression on me even if mostly for the fancy effects, and Jar Jar Binks and the terrible portrayal of Anakin in the 3rd movie just isn't bad enough to make the movies any worse than the originals in my eyes.  Loving the podcast so far!"

The Jury Nullification video was great and will help bring many people to the insight of the power they hold in the court room. I understand the legal barriers to it, but regardless, it is the right of the individual to know this information.  However, I have been a bit disappointed/curious to your stance regarding copyright and IP. The scary perspective you take is that, you find individuals who post your videos around a ""threat to your ability to make a living"". We can discuss this aspect, but you are essentially saying is, in the current system, if someone is ""stealing your revenue"", you believe they should face X # of years in prison/face massive legal fines. Is that really what you want(because you apparently have flagged this)?  You make some very good points about the monopoly use of copyright, the legal issues, etc, but then you go back to a pretty specific/standard perspective about the ""power of copyright""...  I believe that many of your fears are ill placed and a discussion with Stephan Kinsella can be arranged if you are up to this discussion, to hash out some details. I can be a moderator or you two can just discuss away.  I recommend checking his information out at:  His book is available at: http://mises.org/books/against.pdf  His websites:  http://www.stephankinsella.com/  http://c4sif.org/  Watch the video below if you'd like as well and I appreciate ALL your time and effort going into these videos.

For example, a piece of software in 10 can be (almost) useless to be protected, but a book would probably still be as important.  And for those saying we should have a world without copyright I think you aren't seeing the issue from every possible point of view. Free (as in freedom) projects are copyrigthed and they're protecting people from economical interests and encouriging them to create derivative works or contribute directly. I think the issue should not be copyright vs no copyright, but to limit the rights of the creators, as some companies include very restrictive conditions to their works."

CGPGrey,1xavrm,medicaaron,1 point,Mon Feb 17 18:21:11 2014 UTC,"So I listened to this podcast today and it immediately made me think of the Marvel universes. Many of the characters who are currently having movies being made about them were created 50 or years ago. The copyrights for these characters must still exist and the films must be licensed through Marvel. I think this is a great example of one entity controlling the means of distribution and an example of using a famous name/character to pass off really mediocre work. While some of the Marvel films have been good in my opinion, must have seemed half-assed and disappointing. I bring this up for two reasons. Once the superhero genre became popular Marvel studios seemed to be pumping out mediocre movies starring the comic characters I loved. It was profitable enough to produce these movies and rely on nostalgia marketing. What's interesting about the Marvel universe is that comics were always great because they received contributions from so many other people. There would constantly be guest writers and illustrators altering story lines and using the same characters in different ways. This kept the comics and the story lines fresh. Copyrights, and the restrictions that they put on intellectual contributions, prevent this kind of contributions. I just thought this might be a good example as opposed to star wars and harry potter."

CGPGrey,1xavrm,Impronoucabl,1 point,Thu Feb 20 23:08:03 2014 UTC,"Something that was not mentioned in the podcast that I am particularly curious about is citing sources. How come there is a specific formula for each type of source being cited. I understand having the larger styles of citation, such as MLA and APA, but why, within those, does there have to be a specific way of citing a journal article which is different from a book which is different from a government document? Why can't there be one generic formula for APA and one for MLA and one for each of the others, where the title is always italicized and the website is always in quotations and the date always follows the publisher, and everyone would just fill in the information they have for their source? As a student who needs to cite research quite often, it is very tedious and confusing to decide whether I'm citing a work from a database or a short work from a website. Is there a problem with having one specific method?"
CGPGrey,1xavrm,_hoolio,1 point,Thu Feb 20 23:41:51 2014 UTC,"On the subject of stealing vs infringement, the basic premise that I view the two on are that stealing is somebody taking something of yours while depriving you of having that thing, i.e. I steal your car and you can no longer use it.

CGPGrey,1xavrm,Sopio23,1 point,Fri Feb 21 14:08:33 2014 UTC,"Copyright & piracy   This is a complicated issue with lots of subtleties but I wanted to start by pulling apart 2 things which seem to get put together. I am going to define to already existing terms here (probably incorrectly)   I will use Harry Potter as the example here (because i can :-)   piracy - Making a direct copy / reproduction I think most of us feel like something is wrong if someone else was to print and sell the  harry potter book. This seems like it is just abusing the work of JK. Again, there is subtleties, but I think there is more of a 'moral' argument here in general Copyright - You can't play in my make believe world This is the scenario where I might want to make up my own story about how the original founders created hogwarts. This is a much murkier area and comes to issues of ownership over imagination. For example, most of the items/creatures/locations/spells of harry potter are not actually created in harry potter yet there is not 'copyright' infringement to put these ingredients into the books (probably because they don't have copyright on them)   I don't want to go into the arguments for or against right now but I find it harder to talk about copyright law when these 2 very different things are lumped together.  ps. on the side of 0 vs infinite copyright. I, for one, am grateful that there was a time where copyright did not exist  and/or expired. I  think if copyright existed from the start of the invention of language and lasted forever we would live in a MUCH worse place."
CGPGrey,1xavrm,foreverfalln,1 point,Sun Feb 23 20:42:29 2014 UTC,"I am a copyright abolitionist. Kind of.  I would definitely prefer a world without any copyright than one with infinite copyright. I think in a world without copyright, people would pay for stuff because they want to, even if they can get ’em for free. You say somewhere in this podcast that you wouldn’t be able to make money from your videos in a world without copyright; and I am convinced that would not be the case.  You are Subbable user. People do pay for your videos even though they are availabe for free. I strongly believe in a world without copyright, that would be a lot more common. As counter-intuitive as it sounds, people would probably pay even more, and you would probably get more money for your videos in a world without copyright than you do now.  You also say things as expensive as The Lord of the Rings movies couldn’t possibly exist in a world without copyright. Again, I don’t think it would be the case. They would be made through crowdfunding. Also movie theaters would still exist and I do think people would pay to watch the movies in them at least as much as they pay now.  I might be wrong. But I strongly believe in it, and no one ever provided me evidence that I am wrong.  So why did I say I am “kind of” a copyright abolitionist? Well I think one aspect of copyright should remain: obligatory credit to the original author. In other words, I think copyright for all intellectual property should work like the Creative Commons BY-SA license. Or maybe BY-NC-SA, but no more than that.

CGPGrey,1xavrm,leiboy,1 point,Mon Feb 24 08:38:54 2014 UTC,"IAAL (and currently working on my Ph.D. in copyright law). I felt that the point you're making is lacking the idea of ""authors' personality rights"" (also called moral rights).  Copyright spurs invention, yes. But it also serves the purpose of protecting authors to say, ""This is my thing. No, I don't want people to do remixes - because I want my creation to stay the way I designed it.""  (Good) Authors put a lot their own personality into their works. And that is why they might deserve copyright to help them protect this 'embodiment' of their personality.  Apart from that, I loved the podcast and constantly wanted to raise my hand to make a legal comment ;-) I should also say that the above approach is more true to the continental European approach to copyright (called author's rights) and less so for UK/US copyright."
CGPGrey,1xavrm,Trimead,1 point,Mon Feb 24 11:27:28 2014 UTC,"To my mind there's two different issues you raised in terms of copyright:  1) Distribution and ownership of content - who owns or can use clips of videos, extracts of text, reproduce photos.  2) Inspired works - who can use characters, mimic plotlines, recreate poses and shots.  It seems the difference of opinion comes between these. Creativity is enriched by loosening controls on the second one (i.e., I could create a 'Star Wars' spin-off), whereas creativity is incentivised by tightening controls on the first one (i.e., only Lucasfilm can profit from reproducing a copy of an existing Star Wars film).  Obviously it's not a black-and-white distinction between the two but there are 'shades of grey' (pun intended) inbetween. At what point does quoting a work within a new piece constitute copying it? Does altering names whilst reproducing dialogue count as inspiration or copying? I'm not naive to the fact that, especially in the digital age, this is where the challenge lies...but would you agree this is a simple overview of the two ways copyright divides opinion?"

CGPGrey,1ue0av,newstarttn,2,Sat Jan 4 15:39:29 2014 UTC,"This works out quite nicely. One of my current A2-levels is Tudor (C.1485-C.1603) and American history (1890-1990); we're currently revising for a trial exam on US history, so I'll probably watch this documentary to relax whilst still learning :)  Anyway I have a question: I was wondering if I could get your opinion on a concept for a Youtube educational/edutainment channel.  I have a good understanding of how pretty much all areas of UK, US and EU government work (from my A-level politics) as well as a decent understand of some of the major western ideologies (from politics and philosophy).   To help me write essays I've had to design a way of simplifying down the arguments before I start writing. This essentially consists of bullet pointing each major benefit/negative/point-in-the-argument which should be addressed and then sub-bullet points in order until that point in the discussion is exhausted.   The second feature of the channel would be to display the points on either side as if I genuinely believed it. For instance if I was discussing First Past The Post then I'd explain bullet point one in an overly positive manner (maybe including an avatar of some sort, or a special voice) and then explain the second bullet point from an overtly negative perspective (perhaps also including a different avatar and/or voice) and you continue through this process thematically (in an interesting way) and then display the bullet points clearly at the end.   Do you think this is a good concept behind an education channel? I mean, I think I might get out making it and consider such ideas more closely. a lot of the content would/will probably be more interesting than FPTP, like newsy stuff such as austerity, the EU debate, or Falkland Islands/Gibraltar, or maybe even the Israel-Palestine Conflict. If you've read this much I thankyou for your time and would love to hear your opinion, even if it's only in brief :)"
CGPGrey,1ue0av,SimonZerafa,4,Sat Jan 4 16:12:57 2014 UTC,"The bullet point format strikes me as a little rigid, depends on the execution."

If you imagine making one of your own videos there's an underlying structure which you're following (not just you, all video making from Video game tutorials to full scale documentaries). I just see myself as, sort of, sharing a bit of that script and structure with the audience to allow for a more visual representation and easier understanding of the entire subject.

How come Cyrillic letters look like Greek but the line strokes and the font look like Latin? How did Adyghe change scripts, from an Arabic-looking one to Cyrillic? (I'm guessing it was forced.)

Over time, these were largely adopted in the other languages that use the script. Thus, unlike the majority of modern Greek fonts that retained their own set of design principles for lower-case letters (such as the placement of serifs, the shapes of stroke ends, and stroke-thickness rules, although Greek capital letters do use Latin design principles), modern Cyrillic fonts are much the same as modern Latin fonts of the same font family. The development of some Cyrillic computer typefaces from Latin ones has also contributed to the visual Latinization of Cyrillic type.

What's the main thing the average person uses temperature for? Weather. In Fahrenheit, the weather is quite often between 0 and 100 degrees. A nice clean range. Sure it sometimes goes out of it (I'm looking at you, midwest US with -60 deg f windchills the next couple days), but for the most part, it's 0-100.  In Celsius? That's about -20 to 40. The ranges involved just aren't as applicable to everyday life. For things outside of communicating weather to the public, I don't really care which is used. But in regards to weather (the most common use of temperature for the average person), I think that Fahrenheit makes a lot more sense."

I think the key to getting quantity, is getting more creators who can make great content.(that way we're not making the quality/quantity tradeoff)  I also don't think it would be terrible to output some stuff that doesn't make the cut in a different format or such, in a sort of ""b-roll"". I think provided this was done right, I don't think it devalues your core product.    At the same time, I think there is some desire for lower-production-value content from you great creators. I'd love to see a bunch of you guys just sit around and bullshit for 45 minutes on science news, current events, etc... (sort of podcast style).   Keep up the good work."

Everyone keeps touting ""Quality vs Quantity"" as an excuse to take your sweet time and lolly gag and I argue that ""Quantity with Quality"" is the way to go.   If you are having a problem delivering a certain quality(or quantity) within a certain quantity(or quality)... then its a problem you should work on. I don't think sacrificing one for the other is the answer, but rather a symptom of a much larger issue.   It doesn't have to be one or the other and its silly to choose between the two imho."

CGPGrey,1sk8rw,gavers,2,Tue Dec 10 18:48:56 2013 UTC,I think the ratio of quantity to quality is not the inverse of itself. I don't think you can have less quality for putting content out more often or more quality for spending more time on the project. I think it's more complicated and individualized than that.
CGPGrey,1sk8rw,SomeGermanRedditor,2,Wed Dec 11 17:53:09 2013 UTC,"I think that at some point, there is a general willingness to sacrifice some quality for quantity. As in, I would be ""ok"" with more frequent, shorter, less in depth CGP Grey videos. OK, ok, that was only a hypothetical example. I'd not want CGP Grey videos to be any different than they are now.  But other creators, Jacksfilms for example, can sacrifice some of the production quality for quantity and still make a compelling, interesting video. That is the only way Jack is able to do YGS on a weekly basis, and it's something I wait for each week because it's awesome."
CGPGrey,1rvwwb,a_wild_matt_appeared,20,Mon Dec 2 03:40:16 2013 UTC,When starting with GTD I actually recommend starting with pen and paper -- it forces you to keep it simple and focus on the method. (I ran my whole first three years of teaching with just index cards and GTD)  Once you feel like you've really got it then you should move on to digital tools if you find them necessary.  I use Omnifocus and am happy with it.
CGPGrey,1rvwwb,MindOfMetalAndWheels,9,Tue Dec 3 20:39:16 2013 UTC,"Paper these days tends to be underrated. I love wikipedia and kindles and everything when I did my AS-level exams last summer I wouldn't have done nearly as well without having actual, tactile text books and notes. For instance in my AS- Government and Politics exam, you need to have a lot of up-to-date knowledge and an examples to proof your point. For instance you'd want to know what the outcome of a recent bi-election was or maybe the last time a referendum was used for constitutional reform. Using a book allowed me to scribble out out-of-date examples in replace of more recent ones. Additionally I could book mark pages more easily by folding down corners or booking in purpose bought sticking tabs. I can also write in the gabs: ""refer to Hansard's quote from Mr X on the 5th of November year zero"", for instance, or simplifications of complicated sentences, of which a lot of text books are filled with.  A tactile book is much more personable than a digital one which only allows you to make very specific changes and often makes such processes difficult. Digital books have their upsides too, mainly that they can usually be accessed more easily (internet), carried in a greater quantity (eg, a kindle filled with 100,000 books) and are often cheaper. I would read a digital work of fiction on a kindle or rather than on paper because it's more convenient, but personally paper is a lot better for learning in a lot of circumstances.   Pen and paper is also unmatched in terms of note taking. There are certain physical restrictions but the technical restrictions of MS Word or Pages is usually much greater given that you can't add arrows or write in the margins easily. Additionally when I'm in a French or German lesson (sorry CGP) making some kind of table to help understand the grammar can usually be done quickly by writing the persons at the top (Je, tu, il, nous, vous ,ils; ich, du, er, wir, ihr, sie; ect) and then a verb or tens along the other axis. A lot of note taking can best be done using methods which aren't necessarily part of a normal language, but still are perfectly understandable and possibly more understandable than something written in a conventional language.   Conclusion:Learning is personal and everything, but I think that the best tools to use for most people will be those tools which are most flexible. Whilst computers have become much more flexible as times have advanced, they're no where near as flexible as paper and pen and that's why I think, for the foreseeable future, pens and books will remain the ideal set of tools, whilst computers remain a supplementary or auxiliary tool."

CGPGrey,1rvwwb,iBeReese,4,Thu Feb 6 07:10:06 2014 UTC,"I've been using GTD in both my personal and work lives for about 6 years now, and currently I use a hybrid of digital and paper-based techniques. Like MindOfMetalAndWheels, I started out entirely using paper, and it's a good way to get a sense of the workflow and develop the habits associated with GTD. My wife is a teacher and her GTD system is entirely paper based. A friend of mine built his GTD system digitally entirely using Gmail.   The great thing about GTD is that it is pretty indifferent with regards to the actual tools you use to capture, organize, and review your stuff. I also use OmniFocus, but there's plenty of other apps and techniques out there. You can buy guides for implementing GTD from David Allen or do a bit of googling and find tips for free on Lifehacker. And of course there's a subreddit for GTD as well.  One really important point to remember is that whatever you choose to do, GTD works best when you can capture anywhere at any time. If you've got a smartphone that goes everywhere with you, this is easy to do digitally. If not, then you'll be forced to capture on paper, and then process your stuff digitally.   One final suggestion for anyone wanting to do GTD digitally: if you've got the cash, spring for a Fujitsu Scansnap. Much of our world still moves on paper, and these scanners make it so easy to get most of that stuff into your digital system. I just checked the website and the latest models can scan wirelessly to Android and iOS devices. Now you'll excuse me while I clean up the drool."
CGPGrey,1rvwwb,kpcnsk,4,Wed Dec 4 17:19:55 2013 UTC,"I first read GTD when I was transitioning from one job to another. Starting with pen and paper is a good way to figure out what the system is for you before you investigate a digital solution (since there are so many).  If you want to learn more about GTD, check out the latest Technical Difficulties episode with Merlin Mann. Be sure to look through the show notes too. Merlin Mann became somewhat internet famous for some of his work in the GTD space. Beyond the todo list seems to do the best job of summarizing some of his GTD specific thoughts."

CGPGrey,1rkbx0,MindOfMetalAndWheels,73,Wed Nov 27 10:31:17 2013 UTC,My first thought: String together the opening clips of you asking each past video's question/reading their titles. People interested in the answers/elaboration will click to visit your channel. Watching just one video should start an addiction that can only end in binging on every video you've made to date.
CGPGrey,1rkbx0,Xiuhtec,11,Wed Nov 27 11:38:07 2013 UTC,"This is a great idea. Include also some of the most surprising and fun answers.  For example, that coffee lead the the enlightenment and that Canada and the USA shave a visible boarder in the treed areas.   Make links to the videos clickable, obviously.  If you can get people to watch one video, they will watch more."
CGPGrey,1rkbx0,Chattalicious,5,Wed Nov 27 13:45:23 2013 UTC,"This is my vote so far. The problem with coming up with ""best moments"" is that the videos are amazing because they build throughout. I think it would be hard to lift a 5 or 10 second section out of any video that would still have the same punch without the build-up and context.  However, just the questions themselves (along with the trademark video style) should be enough to pique someone's curiosity, and then clickable links from there should do the trick. You may need to make a small new section summarizing the channel at the end, but that shouldn't turn into the time-suck of creating a brand new 30-second animated spot."

I think you're best videos are where you question a long held practice that many people don't think about much because they grew up with it (electoral college, daylight savings time, etc.).  You also have a larger range of material than other educational channels, I never know what subject you're going to do next, just that it will be well made and researched. So maybe advertise yourself as an educational channel that presents the unknown, the uncommon, and the un thought about in a unique and enjoyable way?"
CGPGrey,1rkbx0,double2,19,Wed Nov 27 10:49:42 2013 UTC,"This is a great idea. In fact, make the ad a grey's blog take on grey's blog."

CGPGrey,1rkbx0,imasabertooth,7,Wed Nov 27 16:30:55 2013 UTC,"because people like penny collectors (they exist) will have double the money and the value of everything else like the dollar and quarter would hhave to increase as well, leaving the penny just as stupid and fucking worthless as before"
CGPGrey,1rkbx0,Hamburgex,1 point,Wed Nov 27 18:02:00 2013 UTC,"Okay, I think I worded it the other way around.  Just imagine this: we take the penny coin out of the market, we are left with a bunch of different coins: 2, 5, 10, etc. Then we take the 2 cents coin and change its name to 1 cent coin, etc. This way coins would have the same value, but a different name. We could even make the new former-2-cent-and-now-""1""-cent coins and make them different than old 1 cent coins so people cannot get 2 cents from 1 cent.  Could this work?"
CGPGrey,1rkbx0,HortonHearsAGenocide,6,Wed Nov 27 19:15:50 2013 UTC,Either you're wording your thought horribly or you have no idea how modern currency works at all and don't understand the problems with the penny.
CGPGrey,1rkbx0,imasabertooth,1 point,Wed Nov 27 22:12:30 2013 UTC,"Still not really, in the first scenario where the penny is worth one cent, everything still sucks. In the second scenario where the value of the penny is doubled, everything else's value is doubled as well. End result: stuff costs double, money is worth double, nothing has changed. In the third scenario where we eliminate the penny, and implement the two cent piece: we have essentially done the same thing as the second scenario. We have gotten rid of a one cent piece, and replaced it with a two cent piece. Everything, again will double in price, as the pennies that were, are now worth double, as is all of the other cash and coins. This is why the only solution is to slowly get rid of the penny, like Grey explains in his video, and replace it with nothing."

CGPGrey,1rkbx0,Legato2001,4,Wed Nov 27 23:35:40 2013 UTC,"Do you specificly need to reuse ""old"" videos?  I think with the videostyle you do, an original ad would be very great(instead of using clips from the videos, you could just use the video and retone it (less work)).  Otherwise it really depends on what you want to transmit with your ad. If you want to show how nicely you can transfer conplex knowledge into a viewers brain, a complex part might be nice (like this)  But your style of talking has changed a lot since then(for the better in my view).  If you wanted to show how you can shopw a topic in a humorous way, I guess any part of the pope video is good.(viewercount supports this statement)  I also very much liked the video about the daylightsaving time, which for the life of me I can't find right now.  So I guess if you can not tell us (yet) what the ad should transmit for you (or is it going to be this startup video when entering a channel), I guess it's hard to really give a good answer here."

CGPGrey,1r32w5,queuebit,16,Wed Nov 20 21:08:37 2013 UTC,Have you thought about a second channel where you post the killed videos. You can maintain the exemplary quality of your main channel while giving more videos to those who really need a video fix.  I think any video is a good video to one person or another.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,QuadFermented,20,Wed Nov 20 22:26:48 2013 UTC,Posting a failed video would easily be 80% as much work as posting a real video.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,Autoxidation,9,Wed Nov 20 22:29:41 2013 UTC,"Well if you spent weeks on some, there must have been something. You don't need to edit or anything just upload raw unfinished stuff."
CGPGrey,1r32w5,lordkilljoy,17,Wed Nov 20 23:17:26 2013 UTC,I am guessing most of the work is on paper/computer minus the animation part. So there really wouldn't be a video to post.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,ScannerBrightly,10,Wed Nov 20 23:46:25 2013 UTC,Correct.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,kataskopo,2,Thu Nov 21 07:00:55 2013 UTC,Which is why you should do a blog/something on the side! Where you can write stuff that you find interesting without having to do the whole video thing.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,NULLACCOUNT,7,Thu Nov 21 19:58:09 2013 UTC,"I know it's hard to resist his videos because they're so damn addictive and you just want your fix of CGPGrey, but seriously, stop pushing the man, I would much rather quality, well-researched, nuanced videos every couple of months than slopped together one's weekly.  For him to write that blog would take a lot of work, purely because, as he say's in this video, he hates all the things he doesn't do with his videos, so he could never just release raw scripts because the lack of perfection would slowly kill him inside. TL;DR Give him a break, he likes perfection."
CGPGrey,1r32w5,kataskopo,2,Mon Nov 25 15:17:17 2013 UTC,"What if your ""video graveyard"" was a location where people could see the last state it was in and comment/improve or even make their own copies/remixes ... just seems so sad to have them out back and shot."
CGPGrey,1r32w5,NULLACCOUNT,8,Mon Nov 25 00:48:25 2013 UTC,Can you post a discussion thread on /r/cgpgrey that we can discuss Catan in?  I actually have some pretty strong opinion on why I don't think Catan is a very good board game (both from a game mechanics stand point and emotions of players).
CGPGrey,1r32w5,JamsteRz,4,Thu Nov 21 14:24:31 2013 UTC,"8 hours into a 12 hour game of Twilight Imperium, members of my gaming group are sometimes heard to say ""Hey, did you see that CGP Grey video?"" I feel like our standards for unwatchably boring might be a few standard deviations from the norm....  Of course I can't speak for the majority of the million + views your videos are now generally getting...."
CGPGrey,1r32w5,oojava,3,Thu Nov 21 04:31:36 2013 UTC,Those are my favorite types!
CGPGrey,1r32w5,NULLACCOUNT,3,Wed Nov 20 21:08:03 2013 UTC,I seriously want to watch this!
CGPGrey,1r32w5,mikeyReiach,3,Wed Nov 20 21:59:23 2013 UTC,"Let me put it this way, I've never played Settlers of Catan before but even after watching that little bit about the aborted video makes me want to play it more than anything else. Please give us a 20 minute boring video on Settlers of Catan"
CGPGrey,1r32w5,easjo682,3,Thu Nov 21 02:42:38 2013 UTC,"I want that video too! I recently started watching the Shut up and Listen Sit Down, Shut Up guys and it's amazing!"
CGPGrey,1r32w5,chazzhay,2,Thu Nov 21 17:59:12 2013 UTC,"Shut Up and Listen?  Do you mean Sit Down, Shut Up?"
CGPGrey,1r32w5,Jaredwg,2,Thu Nov 21 19:58:35 2013 UTC,"Yees, those guys. I find their reviews informative and funny."
CGPGrey,1r32w5,chazzhay,2,Thu Nov 21 21:13:25 2013 UTC,Definitely. They are great.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,_sledje_,2,Thu Nov 21 21:21:04 2013 UTC,Unlisted video now.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,lemonteabag,2,Wed Nov 20 22:32:37 2013 UTC,You could just make it a by link only video(forget the name of that on youtube) and let those of us who want to see it bathe in its glory. Btw bought the books you recommended on audible. Sorry for no affiliate but don't have time to sit down and read hopefully this book can change that.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,Horg,2,Thu Nov 21 03:20:21 2013 UTC,"While I also would be fairly interested in a history of board games video (I actually wish this segment was longer and more indepth!), unfortunately you would have had to scrap that video because your central fact is wrong. Settlers of Catan is in fact not the greatest board game ever! (But it is good, despite what /r/boardgames thinks).   That said, I'm not sure I know what is the best board game ever."
CGPGrey,1r32w5,joaomalm,1 point,Thu Nov 21 20:03:43 2013 UTC,Back it a blog post. People can read it at their own pace.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,JackMuffler,2,Thu Nov 21 20:26:16 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I'd've liked to see CGP try to prove why Settlers is the best boardgame out there.  /r/boardgames link for anyone interested"
CGPGrey,1r32w5,joaomalm,36,Wed Nov 20 21:53:16 2013 UTC,The Dota 2 reference was totally unexpected. Great video as always!
CGPGrey,1r32w5,Two-Tone-,12,Wed Nov 20 21:00:54 2013 UTC,:D...  New quest: try to get CGP in a match with you :p
CGPGrey,1r32w5,kaiser13,7,Wed Nov 20 21:22:10 2013 UTC,And depending on how good he is whether I'm with him or against him >:)
CGPGrey,1r32w5,Leider1000,41,Wed Nov 20 21:27:12 2013 UTC,Nobody feeds like me.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,DimitriV,3,Wed Nov 20 22:25:57 2013 UTC,There must be a way!
CGPGrey,1r32w5,xxdofxx,68,Wed Nov 20 23:24:50 2013 UTC,Thanks for the effort you put into this Grey.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,TheRufmeisterGeneral,21,Wed Nov 20 20:44:24 2013 UTC,YAY! A new Grey video is always like Christmas for me.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,Suppafly,13,Wed Nov 20 21:49:23 2013 UTC,"I just got curious about the universal language, care to explain? Great video btw dude"

CGPGrey,1r32w5,xAtri,10,Wed Nov 20 21:14:32 2013 UTC,thanks!
CGPGrey,1r32w5,ryzvonusef,6,Wed Nov 20 21:15:27 2013 UTC,Esperanto is such a fucking cool language.  You only need to learn like 400 root words to be able to have conversation with fluent speakers.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,ryzvonusef,2,Thu Nov 21 08:21:24 2013 UTC,"how have i never heard of this?!  i am going to learn this language, provided i don't give up."
CGPGrey,1r32w5,IsuruKusumal,14,Thu Nov 21 10:12:26 2013 UTC,When you mentioned Yahtzee i somehow got incredibly happy. Thank you :)
CGPGrey,1r32w5,ryzvonusef,16,Wed Nov 20 23:00:42 2013 UTC,Yahtzee makes me happy.
CGPGrey,1r32w5,LordNoodles,22,Wed Nov 20 23:08:18 2013 UTC,"You two need to do an April Fools crossover or something.  Having Yahtzee explain the electoral college would be almost as epic as hearing you utter the phrase ""stonking great tits."""
CGPGrey,1r32w5,xAtri,3,Thu Nov 21 01:56:24 2013 UTC,O god these would be my favorite videos ever...
CGPGrey,1r32w5,RadagastWiz,1 point,Thu Nov 21 15:44:42 2013 UTC,"Thanks for showing me the joy of Yahtzee. I just watched a bunch of his reviews and the guy is great.  He reminds me a little bit of Charlie Brooker, although there are tons of differences as well. But the combination of wit and actual insight seems similar."
CGPGrey,1r32w5,kataskopo,29,Thu Nov 21 11:26:09 2013 UTC,Today I learned about https://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey2
CGPGrey,1r32w5,the-spb,2,Wed Nov 20 21:34:36 2013 UTC,You're not the only one. Also thanks for the link. LOL. Googleing for the channel he mentioned led me to the subreddit. And figured some kind soul might have linked it. :-)

CGPGrey,1r32w5,SlyRatchet,8,Wed Nov 20 23:36:55 2013 UTC,"I had a question about the ""Self Evaluation Loops"" you mentioned:  I'm a strong believer in the Socratic thought that an unexamined life is not worth living. However, the only concrete method I have is the one that I learned a long time ago from my Jesuit highschool. I mean, it has worked pretty well, but I've had to shave off a lot of the spiritual stuff (it is based of the Ignation ""Spiritual Exercises,"" which is great for improving a spiritual life, but kind of lacks when it gets to everyday stuffs).   So basically: what kinds of Self Evaluation Loops do you use? I know you mentioned ""Getting Things Done,"" however, 1) I am incredibly busy and will be for a while and, 2) I always cringe at the thought of a self-help book (mostly because I've been callused to believe that everything in them is BS intended to make you feel empty in order to buy more of their things... not gonna mention any specific, but I don't think I have to because there are SO many out there </rant>). So, followup question to the book, how is this book different from a generic self-help book?  TL;DR: What specific Self Evaluation Loops do you use, and is ""Getting Things Done"" worth my time and why?"

CGPGrey,1r32w5,keymone,1 point,Wed Nov 20 23:15:31 2013 UTC,"For the most memorable visual for me, I'd have to say it was the line about the Battle of Hastings where Burke says something like:   Hand to hand combat in those days was unbelievable brutal because it maimed rather than killed. You died of your wounds later. They did most of the good work with this (holds up presumably historically accurate sword). I'd like to show you what it does to a side of meat, because in battle, that's all a man is.   The camera shots of sword into sides of beef are pretty harsh and there's no blood.  But I can't really argue against how important (and invisible) technology is to our history, so the introduction is probably a more important clip.

CGPGrey,1r32w5,Ozelotten,3,Wed Nov 20 21:45:51 2013 UTC,fair enough. my point was that your videos are probably(?) much more popular than blog articles(you have a blog??) and you could use your million-subscribers super-powers to increase awareness and subsequently adoption of bitcoin. which is all bitcoin really needs. cheers and thanks for all you've doing been doing so far :)
CGPGrey,1r32w5,aeramor,1 point,Wed Nov 20 21:53:16 2013 UTC,"Adding new content to a discussion isn't the only objective of making a video or statement. For instance, I'm sure every piece of information in your Europe video was already available to people everywhere, however you brought all that information into one place and put it in a thematic sequence. In a sentence: You explained it in a brief and eloquent  manner that others had until then failed to do. Explaining things more simply is not the only other motive either. For instance, now that you have one million subscribers you, making a video, will educate one million of your subscribers as to what bitcoin is and why it is useful. As for the subscribers of your who already know what bitcoin is, they'll appreciate it being explained by a teacher of your calibre (eg, the first reason I mentioned). So there's still a lot of good reasons to make a bit coin video. Additionally (and finally) I think that if you were to try and make a fairly comprehensive explanation of bitcoin, you would discover a few things which would objectively add to the discussion."

And all others are just playing along because they don't want to upset china, while the usa actually declared that they will not formally acknowledge that Taiwan is part of the Peoples Republic of china.

The argument now is whether they can co-exist in the international arena. And how much influence Beijing will have over Taipei. (Source: I live here)  The Chinese-Taipei thing mentioned in the vid? That was actually NOT the PRC doing that. Seriously. In 1981 (or there abouts) the PRC was huffing and puffing about the ROC and the olympics. It was the PRC that suggested just using ""Taiwan"" and it was Chiang Jing-guo who said ""NO!""   My TWnese friends like to think that the PRC is apart of the ROC.

CGPGrey,1p2m6g,Ed__,3,Thu Oct 24 14:53:57 2013 UTC,"You need not spend so much time on a director's cut version as you do on a normal video. I know on a normal video the hours of work on your side compared to the minutes of content created is tiny, but there's no reason that those two figures have such a massive imbalance if you were doing a director's cut. People will watch things on all the topics you talk about whether or not the content is as snappy as usual. It's like the various kinds of Vsauce channels and videos. Loads of people watch Vsauce's really well produced, well researched and slimmed down content on his main channel, however many of his fans (about a quarter IIRC) follow Vsauce 2 and Vsauce three as well, despite the content not being quite as good and despite the content being a lot less trimmed down with a much low hours of work to minute of content ratio. So whilst you can't justify spending huge amounts of time at the moment, there's no need it actually be that huge an amount of time. In this video, as with many others, you were really close to coming upon some extremely interesting philosophical ideas such as the various interpretations of what makes a state legitimate, the fascinating topic of whether or not we consent to be governed and all this interesting stuff regarding political philosophy. It was similar with your video on the Netherlands. You explained it very well, however you could have expanded it further into the terminology surrounding the entire benelux, lowland countries."

The issue right now is indifference. Israelis see that after withdrawing from Gaza and Southern Lebanon they got rockets in return. They were about to withdraw from 90% of the west bank(Kadmia won the election on it), but then came the second lebanon war(which got rid of any mood for disengagement). This left the national religious movement the only people interested in the west bank, as the peace movement had been demoralized"

A bunch of american libertarians w\nted to be free of govdrnment opression so they all chipped in and hired a barge and bought hundres of tons of sand from australia. Then they sailed north of austrailia to this coral atoll that didn't ever poke out of the sea but was just below the suface, shipping hazard stuff. So they dumped the sand and raised a flag and created an instant nation. Then they went home.  The only problem was that their new island was in an existing country's (Togo I think) teritorial waters. Since one of the hallmarks of a real country is a millitary, men with guns came and took down the new flag and raised the Togoan(?) flag.  Moral of the story: even when they make more of it, real estate is hard to come by."

Due to its past as belonging to the UK, it has become very different from the rest of China.  Because of this a lot of laws in Hong Kong are also different from the rest of China.

We covered a lot of the same stuff, though yours was short and to the point whereas mine maybe lasted a bit long as I went into detail with the whole China-Taiwan situation which is an absolute mine-field of complexity!  We even made an identical joke where the 5 permanent members of the UNSC say whether or not Kosovo is a country in their native language. I did start to wonder when I saw you asking how to say ""no"" in Chinese on Twitter! I ended up just going for the 不 symbol.   Anyway, loved the video. Keep up the good work."

Not only is youtube terrible at dealing with comments, I've seen spam comments there often, but I've never seen obvious spam comments in other group driven community. Given how long I've been on reddit, including tiny subs, you'd think I'd see a spam comment before it is down-voted into invisibility every now and again. But nope. At youtube on the other hand, even a rare glance at the top comments will often spot obvious spam.   And if that wasn't enough, thanks to youtube's long history of craptastic comments, people who like and make good comments tend to not participate. This only means the remaining comments are even worse."

CGPGrey,1osqy1,cargonet,2,Sat Oct 19 22:34:40 2013 UTC,"So, now that the channel is your job, why does it take a full month per video? I understand that videos aren't easy, but it seems as if 5 days per week * 4 weeks in a month * 8 hours per day (An average full time job) = 160 hours per 5 minute video. This ratio seems a bit at odds with what I'd think of as average. Do you spend a large amount of time on some secret project?"
CGPGrey,1osqy1,LMcCallum,7,Sat Oct 19 23:07:54 2013 UTC,"That may not be very far off - he answered it in an FAQ a while back.   ""How Long Does It Take To Create A Video?"" Tracey, Ohio  I've tracked my time to get an accurate answer and every minute of final video you see takes me between 10 and 20 hours of writing and animating to make. So a typical 5 minute video is 50 to 100 hours of work.  While that's a lot, it doesn't include the research phase which is difficult to quantify -- some of the videos I've made I'd been collecting notes on for more than a year before starting."
CGPGrey,1osqy1,DarkeKnight,3,Sun Oct 20 00:13:48 2013 UTC,The thing that really crushes me is how often a video dies half-way through production.  Having sunk dozens of hours into a project only to abandon it really hurts.
CGPGrey,1osqy1,soulstealer666,4,Sun Oct 20 12:44:29 2013 UTC,That's rough. Why would you kill a video halfway through production? Fact-check comes back with something completely different and uninteresting?

For those of you not able to watch the video (it's explained in the first minute), Creative Assembly (makers of Total War, Rome, Shogun etc.) offered a chunk of cash for them to make a video about the Punic Wars and were given the option to not mention the company or their games - just make an educational video without any interference. I guess the rationale being that sparking interest in the history of the war will  help sales some way down the line when the game is eventually released.  What would your reaction be to being approached to, for example, ""here's a chunk of money if one of your upcoming videos is about fossil vs. nuclear vs. alternative fuels.""?  disclaimer I'm not a shill for any company or cause. It's just a question that popped into my head when reading your post."
CGPGrey,1m8vhc,KidTempo,12,Thu Sep 12 16:32:44 2013 UTC,"I really like Extra Credits.  Not sure if I've snuck in a secret link to one of their videos yet but if not I really should.    I've sort of already been in that situation.  I'll keep things vague for obvious reasons but I was contacted by an embassy that wanted me to do a video about their region of the world.  It was on my list anyway and so I told them that I would consider it.  In the end their PR budget ran short that year so it didn't work out.     I haven't done the video yet but it's still on my TODO list.  So if a company wanted to give me money for a topic that I already planned on doing and it came without sponsorship ties then I would consider it.  Under those circumstances they would be basically paying me to move that project higher up on my priority scale and I don't see any problem with that.    But if a company wanted me to make a video about their product I would say 'no'.  (and I already have many times).    Also: while we're talking about it there is a video that might appear later this year (or possibly next) that will mention a particular charity.  They wanted me to do something related to their topic and I came up with what I thought was a good idea.   Even were the charity to close down today, I'd still have that topic pretty high up on my list of projects."

I'm indifferent to content producers using sponsorship or advertising to make money off their work except when it's a banner ad that covers part of the screen especially when it covers something that you need to see [shakes fist] and product placement that is really badly done.

If they are long, repeated and/or un-skipable, it can be bad enough for me to specifically make a mental note to never use or recommend the advertised product or service.  On the other hand, with sponsors at the very end of the video,  I will often willingly and freely watch the advertising out of honest curiosity."

On a side note, I think that the reason people accused you of this was mainly because it appears as a bit too positive for one product. While I consider the content to be similar to your Coffee video, most people think of Reddit as a product and not as something everyone knows about. Imagine the backlash if your coffee vid mentioned a brand of coffee instead of just coffee in general. I'm not saying I think that way but those haters do."
CGPGrey,1m8vhc,Drackodelmal,4,Thu Sep 12 15:31:38 2013 UTC,"That's... a little dismissive.  I think there are valid criticisms of the reddit video (especially in the context of his other videos) and it definitely has more opinion in it than his other videos, from both the language used to describe reddit (""basically good"") to the selection of things discussed.  I didn't ""not enjoy"" it, but I do disagree with several of his assessments and opinions. I think CGPGrey excels at presenting curious factual material, and this video was substantially different. To say that the criticism is ""obviously unfounded"" and from a ""clear minority"" is really just appealing to your own bias. I think it is a good crash course reddit video, but I don't think it's a, um, ""concise factual report of an intriguing intellectual curio"" as his other videos are, yet still presented as one.  This guy was the top voted on the suggestions and pretty much called it."

CGPGrey,1m8vhc,Kwpolska,14,Thu Sep 12 14:17:12 2013 UTC,I feel the exact opposite way. I think it's best when advertisements are clearly set aside from the content and marked as advertisements.

CGPGrey,1m8vhc,Rant_21,4,Thu Nov 21 00:42:10 2013 UTC,"The problem with product placement is that it creates a pressure to distort the content to be more like a regular advertisement. It's one thing to have all the cars be made by a particular company or to have the characters eat a particular food, but marketing departments want more. The characters begin using the full official product name, the camera lingers on brand logos, and the plot changes to find flimsy excuses to show off a product's features.  This doesn't mean that creators shouldn't use product placement. They have to get their money from somewhere. However, they need to be aware that it comes with pressures that are different from those that come with ordinary advertisements."
CGPGrey,1m8vhc,MyNatureIsMe,3,Thu Sep 12 15:22:40 2013 UTC,Product placement limits the topics that can be covered.

But Subbable comes nowhere near to covering the money lost by not doing product placements, commissions or sponsors -- and I still don't do them. So there is no 'extra' money as people assume with a funding goal of over 100%.   Time to increase the value of your funding goal then."
CGPGrey,1m8vhc,GlassOrange,2,Thu Sep 12 14:58:33 2013 UTC,"Time to increase the value of your funding goal then.    I've already had to adjust it up several times to cover unexpected costs.  (Poster shipping / printing, etc)  I'd rather have it so that 100% represents no pop-ups or interruptors for the moment.  Even trying to cover a fraction of all the other ads would require a huge, huge pushing of Subbbale and that's not something I want to do right now."
CGPGrey,1m8vhc,GlassOrange,2,Thu Sep 12 15:02:07 2013 UTC,I thought most of the criticism came from the video being enierly positive. The additude led people to belive it was advertising.

Though I'd be just as fine with having more videos of possibly wildly varying nature on your main channel.  I noticed that people have very varying opinion about this.

Ðat last one could be easily differed if we went back to using þ and ð, but what about the rest? /ənˈles wiː stɑːt jʉːzɪŋ ði aɪ pʰiː eɪ/ for writing everything, we'll have to create new symbols or use diacritics for the multiple sounds represented by each letter. Even still, how would words from other languages be represented when the phonemes from said word aren't typically present in English (e.g. Bach, loch, Chanukah etc.)?  Now, even if you tell me it should always have had one phoneme per letter, as I said before, language evolves, so the phonemes for certain words would eventually change no matter what. Phonemes in certain positions get shortened, e.g.: comma may have been pronounced /ˈkɔːm.ma/ (not entirely sure, just guessing, though it's possible), but the ɔː became ɒ, one m has been dropped and the a was shortened to ə (/ˈkɒmə/) because it's more practical to say it like so.  Tl;dr: that's impractical, language evolves, phonemes change, letters will end up having multiple sounds no matter what.

CGPGrey,1lf2hh,mrmanperson123,1 point,Sat Aug 31 10:11:10 2013 UTC,JFEG =p
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,HBlight,-4,Sat Aug 31 15:48:30 2013 UTC,"The Ph should've been an F in the first place! But I prefer the JFEG pronunciation, unfortunately I cant use it because no one really says JFEG they all say JPEG. In short I am strongly against non-phoneticism in the English language, I really think that words like Photo should be spelled Foto."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,HBlight,12,Sat Aug 31 15:54:40 2013 UTC,"I've been toying with this for a while and because reddit is such a communal place it feels odd to be working on it in isolation without feedback from reddit itself.   Well, you have your own subreddit with 3500 subs, I'd say that's a good start. I guess I'll give it a read, spoilers be dammed, if I could contribute one thing then it will all be for the greater good! The Greater Good.  Will add edits to this post as feedback below the line:     ""If a link's title is inaccurate, or a new story just filled with lies the top comment on reddit will always be a correction.""   I tend to avoid absoloutes, although your point is one very valid one I love to bring up, reddit gets things wrong, but the crowdsourcing nature of discussion weighting acts almost like a critical mass peer review. I feel the wording could stray away from a grantee to instead a high certainty. Reddit sometimes fails to check itself properly, and to use absolutes might gloss over that."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,PirateNixon,12,Fri Aug 30 19:42:11 2013 UTC,"Well, you have your own subreddit with 3500 subs   I think this subreddit has a pro-me bias, so I'm not sure it's the best place to submit this link.  (But I couldn't think of anywhere else that would be better.)"
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,ksheep,5,Fri Aug 30 19:52:42 2013 UTC,"It's a very good place to post this link for many reasons, most of all relevancy. It would be tricky to place it anywhere that would get popular exposure.   The only active and relevant place I would think of getting feedback would maybe be /r/AskReddit, and that runs the risk of appearing like you are self-promoting, having 'reddit do your homework for you', or even the post not getting caught on and making it to the front page of the subreddit, resulting in not much feedback at all (the script is a TLDR for a great deal of the non-interested).  Yes, we have a pro-you bias, and asking redditors is a pro-reddit bias of sorts. But at least it would mean that feedback is made with the intention of doing it right, and not trying to fuck with the outcome."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,wazoheat,1 point,Fri Aug 30 20:09:22 2013 UTC,You could try /r/youtubers (although it's fairly small).
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,celacanto,3,Sat Aug 31 01:12:27 2013 UTC,"Re: ""Top comment calling out OP if source is false"", I'd saw its equally likely for the top comment thread to just be a joke thread. True, if its glaringly wrong or biased, a correction is likely to be first, but I've seen a number of times when a correction or clarification post was second or third thread, in favor of puns. It also varies greatly on which sub-Reddit you're on, but still…"
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,HBlight,1 point,Fri Aug 30 22:09:41 2013 UTC,"100% agree. Here's a prime example from the front page today, you gave to dig deep to find a comment about the audio being fake (though it was pretty obvious)"
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,TheFallenHero,21,Sat Aug 31 11:13:44 2013 UTC,"It's a perfect explanation of how it works. I just miss the bad side of reddit, like the subreddits  devoted to racism, misogyny, etc. I think the existence of them is a collateral effect of the good principles that generated the good stuff that you cite on the text. Ignore them seem that nothing bad can come of it, and we know that this is not true.  EDIT: I see now that you have inserted the part:   And, of course, because reddit is people, some with masks, you might find that sometimes people say or do terrible things and they're on reddit too. But again, if you see too much of that kind of stuff, you probably want to adjust your subreddits. Like life itself: reddit is what you make it. And it's quickly clear that reddit can only exist because the vast majority of people are good.   Complete agree and it remind me of this Seinfeld:   George: Well, I’ll never meet anyone else again.  Jerry: Probably not.  George: Meeting is hard.  Jerry: Meeting is hard. Why can’t you meet?  George: Can’t meet! Why is that?  Jerry: This is what single people are thinking about the minute they wake up in the morning. And yet we’re surrounded by people, they’re right next to us, on the bus, on the street! But we can’t meet them.  George: Why won’t they meet us?  Jerry: Because strangers have a bad reputation.  George: A few bad strangers have ruined it for the rest of us!  Jerry: It’s unfortunate."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,ajsdklf9df,2,Fri Aug 30 19:52:16 2013 UTC,What controversy do you think should be included?
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,HBlight,4,Fri Aug 30 20:27:30 2013 UTC,"Well now its time for a question that could help us in feedback. What kind of video do you want to make about reddit? So far it sounds descriptive of what the site does, how it does and what someone could expect to get from the site.  The one point I've made so far was to try and acknowledge the angle of ""not perfect, but it's good and fairly self correcting"". So I do agree with the idea that you -might- be too clean cut. But then again, in terms of making an easy to follow video, that is a good thing.   I know this place has some bad shit going on, but that come across as inter-community politics and drama. It's not exactly fitting of your other videos that stray away from drama and mainly seek to educate and entertain. (Considering how often you talk about empires and monarchs, you approach things very cleanly.) I'd rather see a shoutout to the likes of unidan, exemplar of the type redditor who eagerly provides expert information in a technical field and everyone comes out knowing a little bit more because of it. Talking about /r/niggers is like putting an asterisk next to the border of Northern Ireland in the video where you explain the United Kingdom, a great deal of shit happened there, but that is not the point of the video. Avoid the particulars, don't dwell on what bad people have done, but word things just with the understanding that we are not some perfect demigod.... unless you are subscribed to /r/pcmasterrace in which case you are a perfect demigod."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,Shinyamato,10,Fri Aug 30 20:29:22 2013 UTC,This is one of the things about reddit: it is what you make it.  I've never come across /r/niggers or the other controversies that usually get mentioned.  The first time I heard about SRS was this video and ever since then I've been meaning to do reddit as a topic because it felt like the middle third of that was not the place I know.
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,Tigeris,11,Fri Aug 30 20:58:29 2013 UTC,"If I were you, I'd ask the folks over at /r/MuseumOfReddit and /r/circlebroke for a non-biased as it gets view on reddit.  Avoid /r/ShitRedditSays and their partners, you'll only get biased views.  And good lord do not dare ask anyone on the defaults."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,ThomasWinwood,6,Fri Aug 30 21:12:34 2013 UTC,"That's exactly it. Reddit is what you make of it. I have missed huge reddit things while reading reddit every day, thanks to my particular selection of sub reddits."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,BFKelleher,3,Fri Aug 30 23:16:31 2013 UTC,"The middle third is not worth talking about, at all. I mean, just saying that might get me some shit, which is reason enough.   My opinion time: people draw to your videos because they are straightforward (even moreso when you consider the complex shit you deal with), matter-of-fact no nonsense (ok, some nonsense, but only through witty quips and references) Just like you did not dedicate time to child molestation when discussing the Vatican or the Pope, nor should you get caught up in these matters when talking about how reddit works. (A bit hyperbolic, but you get the point) It is simply not relevant.  This is of course based on my understanding of what you are trying to do.  A simple change of language in some places, maybe a mention of ""Remember, this is the internet so always be weary to take such things with a grain of salt"" I just re-watched your Pope and Vatican vids to make sure I was right, but now I read that line in your voice to dilute the idea that Reddit is perfect. Just don't counter-steer to hard and make it seem like content on reddit is worthless or horrible.  Side note, you could probably ask us for bizarre or oddball subreddits if you want a bountiful crop of selection to pick from when you want to name obscure parts of this place.  /r/fifthworldproblems and /r/ggggg/ are two freebies."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,NorwegianWood28,4,Fri Aug 30 21:20:37 2013 UTC,"I agree, that would make for an unbiased video (I personally love Reddit, of course). Especially doxxing and/or internet vigilantism gone awry."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,BFKelleher,2,Fri Aug 30 22:08:29 2013 UTC,"I agree with /u/Shinyamato that Internet vigilantism is a problem on the site that should be addressed.  Although it is a problem with the population at large that people leap to conclusions and judge without knowing the whole situation, the format of Reddit can allow this to go further than it normally would.  Often users (sometimes with an agenda) end up posting top level comments without having the whole story and making some bad conclusions.  We're fortunate that many subreddits (especially the defaults) have and continue to take measures to prevent this, but a lot of them have had a bad learning experience which lead to this."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,BFKelleher,17,Fri Aug 30 20:36:59 2013 UTC,"I feel it's a bit too gushy - there's nothing wrong with being overall in favour of the site, but you'd be neglecting your role as an educator if you don't talk about the flipside to some of the features you herald as things that make Reddit great.   Quasi-anonymity may permit discussions along the lines of ""I am an escort"" which wouldn't happen otherwise, but it also breeds a general lack of accountability. Unacceptable corners of the site (I hope I don't need to name any names) and repulsive individuals are treated with polite ""we don't talk about them"" silence (aided by the lacklustre top-level moderation) rather than derision and ostracism."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,BFKelleher,88,Fri Aug 30 21:05:24 2013 UTC,"You should probably mention something about the repetitive nature of the discussions on reddit. After a few months of regular use of reddit, it's fairly easy to spot reposts, discussions that have been had numerous times with every participant agreeing, just how inane some of the more popular subreddits are, and sheer quantity of racism, misogyny, and bullying you can find on this website.  Since I've been using reddit for over three years and have gotten myself pretty far deep into the meta stuff (how subreddits are run, what all the problems with reddit are, the worst and best communities on reddit), I would recommend:   Not making a video about reddit unless you really think you understand some of reddit's shortcomings and are at least willing to mention them. Not making a video about reddit unless you know how many people you'll upset by presenting one community in a positive or negative light. Not making a video about reddit. Just seriously. Don't do it. The comments will just be filled with anger and bitterness."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,BFKelleher,1 point,Sat Aug 31 19:05:08 2013 UTC,"Yes, there is plenty of misogyny and racism, but I think the level of just general assholes are larger."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,BFKelleher,11,Fri Aug 30 21:35:56 2013 UTC,"I'm not offended by the aforementioned racism, misogyny, and bullying on this site. I'm just calling out that it's there."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,Noobcube64,7,Sat Aug 31 00:59:34 2013 UTC,"The problem is that these things aren't frowned upon, but encouraged. I mean, you can say anything's an opinion, but when you go into /r/atheism saying that they are all wrong and should accept the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, that's frowned on because it's obviously not what the community is about. reddit, or any community, shouldn't be about racism, misogyny, and bullying unless there's some specific warning that that's what reddit is all about. So I'm frowning on them, just as (in my opinion) any decent human being should."

CGPGrey,1lf2hh,beejaybootybutt,2,Mon Sep 9 16:23:14 2013 UTC,"I can't really see the example in that link, since everything is deleted.   Ctrl+F redditbots or snapshot and you'll see what was there.   I see racism against White people all the time, but it's not viewed as racism, because they're white. But when it's against black people, all hell breaks loose.   On reddit? Can you give an example because I hardly ever see it.   Misogyny is also on the same page. If you do it to women, all hell breaks loose. Men however, are free game. (I know Misogyny is specific for women, can't remember the word for men)   Again, can you give an example of this? I seldom see it on reddit."

CGPGrey,1lf2hh,Keithicus420,12,Mon Sep 9 19:27:07 2013 UTC,"I'm not sure if this was the intent, but it reads like a pamphlet on why people should join reddit, meaning that you've left out some of the negative parts of reddit. I think that even if your goal is to convince people to use it, then addressing commonly found negatives would help your end goal.  For instance, I find that I have a lot of apathy in joining the reddit community. I tend to view things in the hot/top view, to avoid seeing a lot of junk. The side-effect of this is that everything reads like it's already been decided. My comments are unlikely to get read or make a difference. I feel like my singular vote means less since it's in the thousands already. It's an RSS feed that includes cat photos."

Smaller ones you are a little bit more impactful."
CGPGrey,1lf2hh,HBlight,2,Mon Sep 9 19:58:18 2013 UTC,"True, smaller subreddits would help. And probably also looking at new from within a subreddit, rather than the aggregated level, would help weed out more of the annoying junk."

It wouldn't hurt to note that they also cannot edit content, just remove stuff that might not belong.

CGPGrey,1le5ug,GlassOrange,2,Mon Sep 9 16:28:49 2013 UTC,What's the safe.
CGPGrey,1le5ug,Noobcube64,1 point,Thu Sep 12 04:22:07 2013 UTC,Basically a yet to be opened safe that got a lot of attention here on reddit some time back. More here.
CGPGrey,1le5ug,curtquarquesso,17,Thu Sep 12 04:46:33 2013 UTC,I like the feeling of community in the smaller subreddits.
CGPGrey,1le5ug,ramdac,1 point,Fri Aug 30 11:54:09 2013 UTC,"Larger subs usually devolve into who can make the funniest one-liner relevant to the post soonest, whereas small subs have a strong community feel to them. People are helpful, say nice things, and have relatively intelligent conversation. /r/Kerbalspaceprogram comes to mind as a well-run smallish-medium size sub with a strong feeling of community."
CGPGrey,1le5ug,rockerlkj,26,Wed Sep 4 17:10:55 2013 UTC,"I like the general cynicism and critical thinking of commenters. On the front page, I'll see a link to what sounds like an amazing article making some claim, or reporting something as fact. Before I even read it, I click to see the comments, and usually that colors my judgement of the articles. People on reddit are good at digging out the truth in things."
CGPGrey,1le5ug,ramdac,5,Fri Aug 30 11:16:29 2013 UTC,"It's important to look at the article and decide for yourself. You might think you're avoiding the hivemind's opinion by looking at the comments and hoping for the truth to be there, but the comments could be just as misleading as the article."
CGPGrey,1le5ug,SlyRatchet,4,Fri Aug 30 12:57:42 2013 UTC,"oh, no worries I do. I use it as a sanity check. I sometimes read ahead anyway to see if I agree."
CGPGrey,1le5ug,Sappho_Paints,2,Fri Aug 30 13:30:10 2013 UTC,"To be honest I also think this can be reddit's greatest downside in terms of discussion, on news threads anyway. It often becomes a discussion about the headline and not a discussion about the facts. It's incredibly inviting to become someone who only reads headlines and seldom reads any deeper. Few people in a lot of the big news threads actually read the link.   I use to be like this because it was so easy to kid yourself that you were really understanding but actually I was just succumbing to sensationalist headlines. Now I always read the article before commenting. That's how a real discussion should take place. All people aware of the facts and debating with a grounding in the same subject. This is often not the case and often on subs like /r/todayIlearned the headlines is completely misleading.  So it's one of reddit's greatest things, but it can easily become reddit's worst thing"
CGPGrey,1le5ug,SlyRatchet,15,Fri Aug 30 19:50:03 2013 UTC,/r/askhistorians   A beautifully modded subreddit with some pretty brilliant people contributing. I can be stuck there reading for hours!

CGPGrey,1le5ug,davidefighter,7,Fri Aug 30 19:52:18 2013 UTC,"how smaller subs are more about the content and less about GIVE MAH KARMA!!!!!! How transparents things are run at reddit.

Tales from your job? we've got that, /r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy is my favorite. Porn? Of course we do and multiple subs for that. educational subs, like /r/askhistorians /r/askscience and appearently /r/asktransgender is one I just found while choosing which ask sub I wanted.

They link a good article, someone makes a joke about, or there's a good question which spouts a cool story, whatever."
CGPGrey,1le5ug,mikeyReiach,5,Fri Aug 30 16:17:51 2013 UTC,"I like the idea that there can be an online community about anything without necessarily having to start a website from scratch.  The sheer breadth of subreddits is staggering.  I also like how NSFW stuff is clearly labeled.  Not everybody wants to see that stuff, even when they're not at work, so I appreciate how easy it is for people to avoid the things they'd rather not see.  This also means that I can focus the content I see on stuff I do like.  Between the subscribing and multireddits systems, I get to see all sorts of great stuff from around the internet.  Another thing I just thought of is that I like being able to discuss all sorts of things without being logged in to a bunch of different websites.  If I see something I want to talk about elsewhere on the web, I can just come here and discuss it instead of having to register with whatever they're using on their website.  And, of course, the fact that people can be very funny.  It's nice to know there are other people with a sense of humor similar to mine.  It took me a while to wrap my head around this place, but now I've come to enjoy it quite a bit.  Thanks to everyone who make Reddit a great place to be (without having to get up out of my chair, of course)."
CGPGrey,1le5ug,Kwpolska,9,Fri Aug 30 17:55:29 2013 UTC,"Reddit is a bit like what Digg used to be. It is a one-stop shop for entertainment - be it animated GIFs, news, WTF, aww. This only gets better as you refine your own front page as you choose to which subreddits you subscribe. Also, since it's crowdsourced, it the majority is always something that I will be interested in seeing.   Sometimes I dread seeing users images in /r/OpenTTD because it's going to cause me to start playing again.   I especially like how you use reddit for commenting and allowing more convenient feedback when you publish a new YouTube video."

CGPGrey,1le5ug,Avengerr,1 point,Fri Aug 30 16:42:10 2013 UTC,"I'm also here for the crowdsourcing + refining it by choosing specific subreddits. With YouTube you only have one concept of popular. I don't care for stupid shit that is compatible with a broad audience. Reddit gives me the opportunity to 'choose the people' who identify the interesting stuff. If I don't like what people think is interesting in one subreddit, I can look for another one with more users that share my interests."

CGPGrey,1le5ug,Dudok22,2,Fri Aug 30 13:42:44 2013 UTC,"I love the way the site is set up. Things that are utterly uninteresting generally don't get enough votes for me to see them, and so there is always new interesting content. The comment sections are always brilliant, again the voting insures that the most relevant/witty comments are seen. I often times like the comments section better than the actual content, as opposed to youtube where the comments are generally vapid."

CGPGrey,1le5ug,tayor618,2,Fri Aug 30 11:27:31 2013 UTC,"It's a place I can share videos, music, etc. that I've made/working on. I still have a rags to rags story but it's at least been a fun ride :)  It's a good resource for lots of topics consolidated into one spot, and interactive at that. I needed advice about a viola repair a couple years ago, so I opened an account on a message board for violas. I don't want to have to do that for every topic I have a question on. One account on Reddit is all you need. Granted archiving topics (like guitar reviews) is not a strong suit here but you didn't ask about that.  I also like the community at the MLPLounge. I can only imagine what that sounds like to the uninitiated, but I don't like flame wars on the internet. I treat people with respect IRL and extend the same courtesy to people on the internet. Being respectfully is built into the charter there; it's friendly, fun and you can post whatever you want to discuss there."
CGPGrey,1le5ug,ThePumptrackDudeGuy,2,Fri Aug 30 11:36:33 2013 UTC,"Personally, I used reddit first for sports content. I'm from Ireland and I'm a huge hockey fan. When I first started on reddit, I knew it was a general internet community so the first thing I did was seek out the hockey community because I knew there had to be one, and so I started browsing /r/hockey.   Wow, was I impressed. The fans there were incredibly knowledgeable about the sport, friendly with one another, and were also able to trash talk other fans without it getting too personal. And that's not just the hockey subreddit. Almost every sports sub is the same way. /r/nfl, /r/soccer, /r/baseball are the ones that I frequent the most, and they're all just awesome communities for intelligent discussion about their respective sports.   It's an amazing contrast to when you see sport discussed on facebook."

I love the fact the fact that in every thread there's usually one person who has an explanation to all the obscure things that get posted. I love contributors like CPGrey who take the time to make complicated things simple. I've learned a lot from those types of videos.

CGPGrey,1le5ug,ThePiachu,1 point,Fri Aug 30 16:23:46 2013 UTC,"I got here via Paul Graham's essay linked at Slashdot.  I left after the Paul Graham breakfast joke. At some points the moderators decided to allow the creation of subs, but they wanted to be the only ones capable of creating them.  Later they allowed anyone to create and moderate a sub.  And later I returned. The first thing I always do is remove all the default subs from my front page. I think subs like /r/wtf are discussing and bad for everyone's mind.   Once I am done getting rid of everything I don't like or think is just a waste of time, I start subscribing to subs I actually like.   Finding new subs I like is a pain in the ass, reddit really sucks at that.  One obvious danger is the self-selection of opinions you agree with. You should try to read things you don't agree with. This is hard, the best way I can manage that is to find well moderated subs which like discussion and up-vote disagreements as long as their are informed and polite.   Also I've found this can only exist in tiny subs. Or very strictly moderated subs.  tl;dr:  With careful selection of sub-reddits, reddit can be a great place for intelligent discussion."

On the internet we all have very awkward Venn diagrams of interests: places we live or have lived, games we play, shows we watch, science, history, math, physics, geography, cooking, sports, economics, whatever.

And I love that people like you can reach out of their fans in an accessible, candid, and organized way. Reddit has by far the strongest organization of content and comments of any large-scale social media site of its ilk.  And I love that reddit circulates news and makes news. Not always good news, but news nonetheless.  Finally, reddit makes for a fascinating case study of humanity. Ever notice how the punchline gets far more upvotes than the commenter who set up the joke, even if he/she clearly knew someone would finish it? Or how people repost for karma, which is entirely meaningless? I have a lot of comment karma but I find it to be a byproduct of sharing my thoughts. There are meta communities, communities that rip on those, ones that make fun of those, etc. As a subreddit grows, more people post. There's controversy everywhere, just like in the real world. We like to think we redditors are a collective, but we're just people from the outside world who, in our occasional unified mockery of public opinion, ironically emulate it.  The best way in my opinion to get the most out of reddit is to moderate subreddits you're interested in. I mod ELI5. But I also love moderating a MUCH smaller sub, /r/shittypoetry. I love that this site has something for everyone, it's alive, and that it connects people who otherwise would not have such a strong forum in which to share their ideas."

CGPGrey,1le5ug,thebhgg,1 point,Fri Aug 30 12:48:43 2013 UTC,I really enjoy /r/nfl. It's a really good community. Some of the funniest things I read on reddit are in complaint and trashtalk threads on that subreddit. Everyone's making fun of each other but it's in a lighthearted way.
CGPGrey,1kobx1,MindOfMetalAndWheels,21,Mon Aug 19 16:53:28 2013 UTC,"Can't wait to see some of the videos you have planned. I was wondering if you would be making another Grey's Favorites playlist any time soon, since those are some of my favorites?"
CGPGrey,1kobx1,ApolloX-2,18,Mon Aug 19 17:19:31 2013 UTC,That's interesting to hear.  I didn't think many people liked those.
CGPGrey,1kobx1,Dymix,18,Mon Aug 19 17:21:23 2013 UTC,+1 to Grey's Favorites. One of the best ways to find great content on youtube :)
CGPGrey,1kobx1,ApolloX-2,7,Mon Aug 19 18:54:33 2013 UTC,"They are interesting to watch and show me the kind of stuff you are interested in, like the last one was on education and how it was going to change in the decades to come. And thanks to you I finally learned about Khan Academy which really helped me in Biology and College Algebra, so i think they are pretty awesome."
CGPGrey,1kobx1,iBeReese,5,Mon Aug 19 17:29:48 2013 UTC,I remember going a two-week TED talk rampage after watching the education edition of Grey's favs. More playlists would be awesome!
CGPGrey,1kobx1,SlyRatchet,4,Tue Aug 20 04:27:11 2013 UTC,"They're obviously not as exciting as having an entirely new video, but they are very nice to have. You usually find some pretty niche stuff which I've never seen before and it's lovely to have it all there for me to watch, even if I don't take advantage of it very often.   If you know of a whole load of interesting videos which follow a similar theme, are you losing anything by putting them into a playlist for us?"

CGPGrey,1kobx1,CoachSnigduh,2,Tue Aug 20 01:16:47 2013 UTC,"I too am newly absolved of guilt, just finished my IGCSEs. You 'buy' perks through subscription from what I can gather, similar to kick starter."
CGPGrey,1kobx1,embolalia,3,Tue Aug 20 01:30:00 2013 UTC,"In that case, I'd like an option to buy a poster.  My dorm room is in need."
CGPGrey,1kobx1,CoachSnigduh,3,Tue Aug 20 01:39:27 2013 UTC,"You can. Well, you can make a one-time payment and then use that credit on a poster, which is basically the same thing."

I know the vlogbros sell a fair bit of community generated content."
CGPGrey,1kobx1,Hoptadock,3,Tue Aug 20 04:29:18 2013 UTC,"That's a great idea. That way, this Subbable thing won't stress him out too much. It appears to me as if the whole perks thing now requires Grey to invest time on posters and other stuff in addition to the videos. We definitely don't want the Perk fairy to show up now, do we?"
CGPGrey,1kobx1,Two-Tone-,2,Tue Aug 20 13:57:57 2013 UTC,"We definitely don't want the Perk fairy to show up now, do we?   One of the reasons I went with Subbable is that they are structured in a way that won't make that happen (unlike kickstarter).    But if I find that perks are taking up too much of my time I will reduce the number of the available."

I even let Youtube send me email when you upload new video. I almost feel like a fan.  8-[ So I'll take that money I wanted to donate for coffee and buy instead myself a coffee.

The charity Grey chooses then turns out to be a college fund for my own education and instead of giving Grey the money to put into the fund simply cut out the middleman and make the fund myself.   You can also see it as a donation to increase your quality of life because by the sounds of it that's what Grey would want. Personally I'm fine with mine so I choose to put it aside for education."

CGPGrey,1kobx1,Peetrius,3,Mon Aug 19 17:23:05 2013 UTC,"The 175% number is an overestimate now because of some of the technical problems that have happened.

CGPGrey,1kfrj5,ThePiachu,26,Thu Aug 15 19:36:35 2013 UTC,Thanks for the tip.  I think that bot is a great tool for introducing Bitcoin to the very receptive audience on Reddit.    Edited to add: Thanks for crossposting this to /r/Bitcoin.  I'd be curious to see what the users over there think.

The best way forward is pretty much how things are going: get vendors to start accepting. We have reddit, humble bundle and a few others accepting, now we should push forward to web apps and SaaSs, then onwards to retail.  Is subbable considering taking the web's shilling?"
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,bbqsamich,4,Thu Aug 15 20:03:58 2013 UTC,"Is subbable considering taking the web's shilling?   I don't know what their plans are, but I'm guessing that won't happen until Bitcoin can support recurring payments."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,bbqsamich,3,Thu Aug 15 20:14:02 2013 UTC,"Off chain recurring payments are available via coinbase merchand tools + coinbase wallets.  https://coinbase.com/docs/merchant_tools/recurring_payments  On-chain recurring payments are in development for a future version of the reference client (in theory the core protocol already allows recurring payments, its just a matter of coding clients to interpret the function)."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,Turbonoodle,2,Thu Aug 15 22:03:48 2013 UTC,"Bitcoin itself cannot support recurring payments because only the owner of the wallet can sign transactions (similar to how only I can hand you a dollar bill from my wallet). A subscription service would need to offer wallets for people to deposit into and then eat from that pool until it is empty, prompting the user to refill it. At that point, though, you may as well just allow advanced payment of a subscription instead and/or have a payment notification (with bitcoin link to pay immediately) on a recurring cycle.  Another option would be to work with someone like Coinbase, who has a bank account attachment they can draw from, to handle the recurring payments. At that point, however, you may as well not be using bitcoin since you're increasing your transaction costs."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,BigKev47,3,Thu Aug 15 21:02:12 2013 UTC,"Of course, assuming you have all of your bitcoin always in something like Coinbase, whom has the ability to sign your transactions for you (since you don't actually own the wallet there), pulling transactions out of there on your behalf to a subscription service would be possible (even without the USD bank account tie in). This is effectively how banks and credit cards work with USD."

CGPGrey,1kfrj5,sir_talkalot,9,Fri Aug 16 13:37:40 2013 UTC,How do you get started with Bitcoin? I'm a little confused about wallet addresses that seem to be bound to a single computer and how to get money to your wallet. Are you supposed to have multiple wallets and addresses on multiple devices? How do you organize your bitcoins?
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,l1ghtning,10,Thu Aug 15 19:56:14 2013 UTC,I have one wallet and multiple addresses.
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,weramonymous,5,Thu Aug 15 19:57:28 2013 UTC,"How does that work? Does anyone have a link to an in-depth Bitcoin intro? Like, how to use it, not what it is or how it impacts society"
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,l1ghtning,11,Thu Aug 15 20:04:56 2013 UTC,"A wallet contains addresses (multiple ones). What you actually ""own"" are the private keys to those addresses that allow you to spend the Bitcoin that are in those addresses.  Different wallets will have different sources of addresses.   Desktop clients include: 1) Multibit (recommended) 2) Bitcoin-QT (official reference client) 3) Electrum 4) Armory    Web-based wallets: 1) Coinbase 2) Blockchain.info 3) Inputs.io    In short, imagine it like this: Each 'client' you have is like a real-life wallet. You can have as much as you choose and you can have as much money in them as you want. If you want to 'consolidate' your money, you have to take out of your other wallets and put it into one wallet. If you want to go out to a bar and not take all your money, you remove some of the money in the wallet and leave it in a wallet you keep at home. If you don't want all your money to be in wallets in the home, you put some of the money away into a new wallet that you put in a safe. And so forth.  Wallets = containers of Bitcoin addresses. Addresses = ""Denominations"" of Bitcoin. In real-world currency there are only say $1, $5, $10, etc. But with Bitcoin there's no physical constraints and thus addresses can have any kind of denomination. Just know that you have multiple addresses.    If someone wants to pay you, the metaphor doesn't stretch as well to real life. The best way to explain. Imagine you give someone a blank check (a new Bitcoin address you generated for your wallet). You tell them, please pay 5 BTC. When they do, they've transfered that value to that 'blank check'. Remember, addresses can have any denomination, even zero.  Hope that helps! Any more questions, welcome."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,BigKev47,4,Thu Aug 15 20:20:25 2013 UTC,"Thanks! That makes a lot of sense. One more question: if you get a different address each time a transaction happens, how does it work that you see people posting bitcoin addresses people can donate to on their websites? Are you able to reuse them? Or do they post new addresses every time they get a transaction?"
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,An0k,7,Thu Aug 15 20:29:21 2013 UTC,"Yes. That's where the metaphor breaks down a bit. ;)    Remember, each address is just some denomination (0.001 BTC, or 10 BTC, or 12.3421 BTC). This denomination can rise and fall as you consolidate wallets and spend it.  However, to continue with the 'blank cheque' metaphor. Each address is free to be filled up as much as possible. So you can have an address that you can post on sites, or wherever, and people can pay you Bitcoin into it.  When spending Bitcoin, however, your wallet decides on it's own what addresses to use to spend the Bitcoins. This is a bit more technical, but it makes sure that you don't 'pollute' the blockchain with pointless transactions. And it works similar to how normal money works.  If you need to pay someone $75 and you have two addresses with $50 in them, your wallet software will take both those addresses as ""inputs"" and give you $25 change into a new address. Your wallet software will however just fancily show you the result.  You CAN also use a new address for every transaction. Some people swear by this to increase anonymity. If you know I own this address (1simon3Hx8nNgqkxLHhfzX65xdBaeTuJt), you can track what I do with it."

CGPGrey,1kfrj5,throckmortonsign,4,Thu Aug 15 20:12:41 2013 UTC,"Okay, I wanted to use the phrase ""all due respect"", but that has connotations these days; the point being that I'm terrified I'm coming off as the 'fiat currency loony' trolling your thread and I adore you and your work and this community...   But it was just a few weeks ago that you seemed a little non-initiate in the ways of BTC...  are you sure that you've properly controlled for the perhaps irrational exuberance that such a nifty-seeming technological step tends to elicit from us nerd types?  The technology/protocol is pretty damn iron-clad in terms of what it actually does, and is such a beautiful accomplishment in that sense...  but the hard-science technology is certainly not the issue with BTC (if, indeed there is one); that's more a soft-science Political Economy thing...  I really hope I'm not coming off as 'that guy', and it's certainly not my intent.  But on some level BTC terrifies me, because I see so many of the smartest people I know going full-steam-ahead on the BitTrain.  And if that goes bad in a BIG way, it would suck a lot for my favorite cohort of the population.  Not trolling, just trying to keep the level of rigor we're applying to our broad-stokes-socioeconomic ideas as stringent as possible.  Sorry.  If I'm out of line, lemme know and I'll delete, and I'll totally ebay the United Kingdom poster I'll have earned by March, and donate the proceeds to the Society for the Abolition of Foreign Language Education."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,bitcointip,3,Fri Aug 16 00:54:35 2013 UTC,I get what you're saying and I think it's a good point. Any flaw in the technology (and that's if there is any) will be solved really fast. I am more worried about a government decision that would make bitcoins unusable for anything legal.
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,BigKev47,3,Fri Aug 16 01:21:08 2013 UTC,"And that's certainly a big thing; though really my objection is more intrinsic...  I fundamentally disagree with the idea that an inherently deflationary currency is in any way desirable. I genuinely believe that were we able to magically wish BTC into being a universally accepted reserve currency, we'd be setting ourselves up for Great Depression level macroeconomic drama.  And that's beside the fact that for that the adoption and uptake have some IMO insurmoutable obstacles ahead of them...  For something to be currency, people need to take it in exchange for good and services. Which is becoming easier and easier, with the internets... but as a fraction of the real economy? A rounding error.  If you want to use something as a currency, the LAST thing you want is speculators playing the margins and buying and selling for profit...  Because that affects how much the loaf of bread costs."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,throckmortonsign,2,Fri Aug 16 01:35:30 2013 UTC,I have to admit I don't know enough about economics to be able to judge that. However I don't see any major difficulties in adoption by individuals. Nowadays everybody has a mobile phone. It's becoming the first and only mean of handling money other than cash for a lot people in developing countries.  I would be curious to see if any big company would find a interest in BTC...
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,the-spb,1 point,Fri Aug 16 01:45:40 2013 UTC,"There are other cryptocurrencies that are available, though certainly not as popular as Bitcoin, that have an inflationary/demurrage setup. The most popular one would be Freicoin - https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Freicoin. It should be noted in Economics there is the impossible trinity that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to setup a cryptocurrency to fix to some price. It should also be noted that when bitcoin has a deep enough market that it will be much harder to manipulate and speculate on the value...  in fact, if its market becomes large enough, it could be used for a speculative attack on other currencies (link)."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,l1ghtning,2,Fri Aug 16 03:39:33 2013 UTC,"Don't have time to read your link (and probably shouldn't try after 2 whiskys), but I don't at all disagree with the premise...  if BTC were to have a deep enough market, it'd would obviously be more immune to speculatory fluctuations, The Planet Money Effect, and all that...  but I honestly just don't see how that happens.  Upthread /u/An0k wondered aloud what would happen if any big companies took an interest in BTC...  Because obviously that's what Market Depth requires, and all our theoretical models of how it could grow into a really viable currency somewhat require some mainstream acceptance.  Wordpress and Reddit are nice and all, but if you want to swim with the big boys, you've gotta be talking Amazon.  But I just don't see how that's even possible.  If Amazon decided to take an interest in BitCoin, it wouldn't take particularly long for BTC to become a hugely overengineered brand of AMZNBucks.  Amazon's Market Cap right now is $130 Billion.  Bitcoin's is a little under $1.2 Billion.  That's two orders of magnitude... and Amazon is just one example of a major tentpost of the modern economy that bitcoin just has no chance at capturing...  if the market were deeper, sure... but the market can only get deeper if there are merchants and services out there for which it can be traded; and the grassroots community over on /r/bitcoin subletting their timeshares in BTC or whatever isn't even a blip on that radar.  To say nothing of the single most entrenched and powerful creditor in the modern money system - the United States Government.  My Google-fu tells me that in 2013 their tax revenue is projected at something like ~$5.4 trillion.  Back of the envelope math puts that at >4000x the value of all the bitcoins in existence.  And if I'm sure of one thing in this crazy nonsense, it's that nobody will ever be able to pay their debts to the US Government in Bitcoin.  My RES Live Preview is starting to look really long, and again, I don't want to be That Guy...  I hope I haven't come across as condescending or self-righteous or fallen into any of the other Classic Blunders of semi-drunken Redditing.  I respect the ideology of the community, and the individuals who constitute it.  I just think on the Macro scale (which is the only scale that really matters in terms of Monetary Economics), BTC can't possibly live up to the hype."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,throckmortonsign,4,Fri Aug 16 04:27:39 2013 UTC,"You are right in a lot of ways. I've been around bitcoin and watched it go from 3$ per coin to where it is now, more than 40 times larger in less than 2 years. I don't know where the growth will stop at. What I do believe is that the potential utility of it is huge and I don't think it has reached that potential yet.

And I don't think we disagree nearly as much as it would seem, if, say, we were having this conversation in /r/technology and getting sucked in by trolls on either side.  I just think that the particulars of Bitcoin's emergence and evolution make it really tough for BTC per se to really live up to its ""potential"".  That very growth you're talking about is what makes it so sketch, because it created all these Internet Fairy Tales about newly minted millionaires who bought in at $.50 or whatever...  Money is the measure of a profit; it really really shouldn't be a vehicle for said profit.  But I do think it's an amazing proof of concept.  The external forces of the Reddit circlejerk and the speculators and the neo-Libertarian fearmongering and CP/drug associations and the very novelty (Planet Money stories) associated with BTC itself just seems like too much baggage...  But I am in agreement that it is the Shape of Things to Come, in many ways.  Not sure if the winning horse is one of the ""competing"" cryptocurrencies (of which I confess I'm almost entirely ignorant), though I tend to think it's something we've not seen yet.   This nascent iteration of the concept is more akin to the Liberty Dollar than anything else...  but the form of the thing is compelling and useful.  Within a generation we'll see the re-iteration that will stick, and that will be a lot more like the Euro (in terms of institutional support and buy-in; I've gotta believe it'll be far less shitty in application).  In any case, thanks for the tip.  Forgive me for making my recompense via fiat."

CGPGrey,1kfrj5,BigKev47,1 point,Thu Nov 14 01:29:43 2013 UTC,"Freicoin is reasonably large but it is not largest altcoin. It depends I suppose on your definition of 'largest'. Most people would measure it with market capital. In which case litecoin is far larger.  http://coinmarketcap.com/  Freicoin is, notably, one of the SHA-256 algorithm based coins. While there are other SHA-256 coins, most altcoins are actually based on the scrypt algorithm. The reason for this is probably beyond the scope of discussion in this subreddit. The short of the matter is that SHA-256 based coins can be mined using the new '3rd generation' ASIC based hardware. Ironically this hardware's incredible improvement 2nd generation harware (mining on FPGA chips and computer graphics cards) that it has put the security of all the SHA-256 altcoins at risk. Scrypt and its coins are inherently less vulnerable to attack from 3rd gen tech since that tech has not yet been developed to mine scrypt. Currently you can only mine scrypt coins on a computer CPU or GPU, whereas bitcoin and the SHA-256 coins can be mined on CPU, GPU, FPGA, or ASIC tech.  But as I said, the majority of altcoins are scrypt based.  Example: statistical overview of many 'active' altcoins: http://www.coinwarz.com  First point for more reading: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=134179.0 And that whole sub-forum too.  A notable special case is the relatively new (~month old) Primecoin which instead of doing the arguably-wasteful* SHA-256 or scrpyt operation, attempts to find some specific types of prime numbers. This is currently also one of very few coins which can be efficiently mined on computer CPUs.  *Would you like to know more?: SHA-256 and scrypt arguably waste energy because their computations serve only to secure the network and intrinsically the output / end result of mining serves no other purpose. Mining Primecoin blocks not only serves to secure the network and verify transactions that are undertaken, but it simultaneously attempts to find specific types of prime numbers, the usefulness of these is debatable in itself but they are mathematically more interesting than the computational outputs of the other coins. Thus when mining is 'successful' (ie. a block is found by that miner or that miners pool), they have in fact found a prime number of some specific mathematical complexity or length that the P2P network has deemed worthy of a payout."

CGPGrey,1kfrj5,BigKev47,2,Fri Aug 16 15:11:05 2013 UTC,I agree. From the new bitcoin users point of view altcoins should not be worth worrying or caring about. From my point of view as a miner trying extract every fraction of coin per unit time from my hardware though... alt coins are critical!

CGPGrey,1kfrj5,BigKev47,16,Thu Aug 15 20:00:09 2013 UTC,"The decentralized nature means everyone takes care of keeping 'track'. The blockchain (or the shared public ledger) is passed between all the clients on the Bitcoin network.  Exchanges serve as points where users can deposit national currencies, and exchange for Bitcoin (which other users own). There's no central authority that issues the Bitcoins. It's based on algorithm and is given (as a reward) to the computers that help verify and maintain the network. The whole system keeps itself in check, and has been brilliantly designed. No one can fake any Bitcoins."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,l1ghtning,3,Thu Aug 15 20:24:16 2013 UTC,"So am I to assume that the whole Bitcoin system is based on the honor system and the hopes of self-sustaining order? (I apologize if the wording comes off as challenging, but I didn't know how else to phrase it. :) While this seem practical and doable in a small/moderate scale, I fear that once Bitcoins enter the mainstream, corporations and large Bitcoin holders will mess up the system. I remember when the Forbes list was published (or it may have been another major article covering the rise of the Bitcoin; can't remember for sure), the value of the Bitcoin dropped significantly. Though the value has since stabilized, what if this were to happen again. What if a vast quantity of people decided to pile their hopes and confidence on this?

I'd recommend an insite:reddit Google to find some good threads where both sides are pretty fairly represented in the aggregate (though specific subthreads are SRS material).  My personal objection stems not from any issue with the thoughtfulness or completeness of the design, but from underlying macroeconomic assumptions upon which it's based.  But those are far better elucidated in many many threads all across Reddit than I'd be capable of.    IMO in terms of Monetary Philosophy; Goldbugs are wholly irrational, BTC is rational to a fault, and the USD is far from perfect but flexible enough to be rationally understood in an irrational universe.  The line between the Vision that is the engine of progress and Navel-Gazing Utopianism is a very blurry one."

Deflation should be self-correcting. It's also in a way more empowering for the average person because they don't have to invest their cash somewhere just so that they don't lose value (due to inflation). I also feel healthy amounts of deflation is what we currently need in the world. We've been growing rampantly, focusing on growth. Inflation helped in maintaining that, but we well know we are on an unsustainable trajectory. We need to get away from consumerism and frivolous spending, because it is unsustainable. Deflation instill that ideals in consumers. They will only spend when they really need something. And when they realise that having money means increasing their wealth, they will hopefully change from becoming consumers, to becoming producers.    That's just a speculation. Wild ride, either way. Exciting!"

I totally understand where this thought process comes from, and on the anecdotal individual scale, it seems to make a lot of sense.  But as much as irrational spending gets us in trouble, this sort of saving is kind of worse.  It's a tremendously widespread misconception that I think stems from how easy it is to conflate money and value. Money is just a fairly arbitrary measure of wealth.  Value is the thing in itself.  The fact that predictable, moderate, targeted inflation incentivizes people to invest rather than ""save"" is a good thing.  It's a ""tax on idle money""...  be it a fat wallet of bitcoins or a mattress full of greenbacks.  That money isn't DOING anything to perpetuate value in the economy.  Whereas investment puts that value back into play...    The stock market (for example) gets a bad name - and honestly a lot of it's deserved with crap like high speed trading - but at its core it's a way for companies to raise money in order to expand, employ people, and bring useful products to market. And in the age of E-Trade, it's an extraodinarily democratic...  During OWS and all the talk about The Evil Bankers and how unfair it all is, I didn't rant on Facebook or get in shouting matches with my parents at family get-togethers;  I took a few weeks worth of beer money and bought a couple of shares of Chase.  So now, in some small way, my economic fortunes are intrinsically linked with those of Jamie Dimon.    Wow, wall of text.  Sorry.  I guess the core of my feeling is that things like gold and BTC and the narrower definitions of ""saving"" are bad for us, because they foster a ""Looking out for #1/us v. them"" mentality.  I much prefer to live under the perhaps naive assumption that We're All In It Together.  TL;DR - Hell, I don't know how to even start...

This is a complicated topic to explain in a technical sense to someone not already well familiar with bitcoin, and specifically: mining bitcoin.  I will just say that the bitcoin network has grown to such a substantial size, and over such a distribution of users, that it is no longer technically or imaginably feasible for any person or entity to 'attack' or 'mess up' bitcoin. For example, even if every military and government datacenter that is known to or likely to exist on the planet attempted to overpower the bitcoin network, they cannot physically possess enough computer equipment (in a quantitative sense) to achieve their goals.

BTC has a market capitalization of ~$1.2 Billion dollars.  JP Morgan recorded $5.7 billion in profits just in Q4 of 2012.  If they felt the inclination, they could make the valuation of BTC move however they wanted... a quiet consolidation/buyup followed by a huge public sell-off if they wanted it to crash, or an aggressive and public ""CHASE MUST HAZ BITCOIN"" buyup if they wanted it soar.  The various nefarious ends they could put this power to I'll leave to your imagination and/or other Redditors better versed in financial chicanery than I am.  I don't think it's particularly likely to happen, as at $1.2 billion worldwide... its just way too small potatoes (coincidentally the same reason I think the ""market depth/widespread adoption"" scenarios for its long-term viability as a currency are rose-tinted, to say the least.)"

CGPGrey,1kfrj5,Nylund,1 point,Fri Aug 16 00:35:45 2013 UTC,"Anyone with programming skills can devise their own programs or websites that can interpret the data in the blockchain (the public ledger of all transactions, balances, etc). There are so many websites out there that do this. Probably the best example to what you are after is www.blockchain.info which not only provides information but also provides services that many users find useful (for example, 'wallets' that do not require you to use the official wallet client (bitcoin-qt, and it's full 9 GB blockchain).  Specifically, note their 'Charts' and 'Stats' links at the top of their site...  It's important to keep in mind though that no one controls bitcoin directly. There are devs (programmers) who guide the creation of the official wallet client (bitcoin-qt), which is open source content that anyone can review and contribute to, by the way. Their official client is only so official in that something better has not come along and been adopted by the masses, as sometimes does happen in software development. It's also important to note that if the devs decided to radically change their client to somehow benefit themselves or to disturb the bitcoin development as a whole, other groups or individuals could step up and maintain the network in way that might be more favorable to the majority of bitcoin users. Concepts like these are advantages that bitcoin has over conventional currencies, indeed they might seem quite alien at first.  Most of the fundamentals of the bitcoin network today are still the same as in the famous white paper authored by the so called Satoshi Nakamoto although no one really knows who or what he/she/they are. It may have been a mathematical genius looking to maintain anonymity... or a bunch of clever college students in their spare time. It's part of the mystery but the concepts revealed in the white paper have proven themselves time and time again.  In a sense, bitcoin miners are the ones who do the 'hard work' so in one sense they 'control' bitcoin. Their machines are the ones that do the processing the provides the security to the network so that any one entity or groups of entities cannot attack the network and defeat it. For example in some of the small cryptocoin alternate coins (of which their are many) they have undergone 51% attack, where an attacker has at least 51% of the computational power of the network under their control. Thus they can manipulate the blockchain in a statistically significant way and alter it as they desire. However, bitcoin has grown to such an extent that now this is essentially impossible. New mining hardware revolving around ASIC chip technology has meant even the casual bitcoin user can obtain relatively cheap devices the size of a USB stick which can contribute to securing the network, 'doing their part' you might say.  If you wanted to access a 'repository of knowledge' then I might suggest the bitcointalk forum. It is arguably the largest place where people get together to discuss these topics and more. As much the /r/bitcoin subreddit is a cool place for developments and news, it pales in comparison to the sheer volume (and arguably, quality) of discussion that is at bitcointalk."

CGPGrey,1kfrj5,Shinyamato,3,Thu Aug 15 21:19:15 2013 UTC,"Bitcoin allows anonymous transactions.   This point is actually not true at all. Bitcoin is less anonymous than using regular currency.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Privacy   Bitcoin transactions are broadcast to the entire network, they are inherently public. Using external information, it is possible, though usually difficult, to associate Bitcoin identities with real-life identities. Unlike regular banking, which can preserve customer privacy by keeping transaction records private, loose transactional privacy is accomplished in Bitcoin by using many unique addresses for every wallet, while at the same time publishing all transactions.   In addition, as part of it's counterfeiting measures each bitcoin has a history of the transactions it was used for. Seizing the assets of silk road, for example, would allow a third party to analyse the funds to see who gave them the money. For normal digital transactions, they would need to have a warrant to get this information from a bank (which may not be possible if it came from overseas) and for cash they'd be completely out of luck.  Bitcoin enthusiasts seem to think that ""my bank can't see it"" means a transaction is anonymous, but when your transactions are broadcast to everybody in the world and your fingerprint is left on every coin it isn't  anonymous at all."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,Nylund,0,Fri Aug 16 08:12:30 2013 UTC,"You are sort of right but I want to discuss more.  It is quite easy to conduct a virtual transaction with bitcoin where absolutely nil information about the people behind the computers at either end can be obtained.  The lack of anonymity comes instead from when you try to either buy or sell the bitcoin in the real world, trade it, exchange it, whatever you want actually do with it. Examples:   You go to the localbitcoins site and message a guy named Joe. You message Joe and agree to meet in a cafe near a subway in Atlanta. You and Joe know very little about each other, but you are not anonymous because: i. You have revealed your identity (at least your appearance and rough location) to Joe. ii. You were recorded by numerous surveillance cameras. iii. You might have transferred bitcoins electronically (via phone, netbook, laptop, etc) and used a data service that was not secure or anonymous. You buy some bitcoin from an exchange site. You provide your CC / paypal / bank account information and complete the transaction. You are not anonymous because by definition these services and products are all linked in many ways to your identity. It is possible to make a 'anonymous' paypal account however it is pain in the ass and probably breaks many local laws depending on where you live. You buy some bitcoins from a website that accepts cash deposits at any of their banks branches. You walk in and deposit $200 with no questions and no ID requires and their account is credited. You get your bitcoin. However, you are not truly anonymous because: i. You walked into a bank and were seen by over 9000 cameras. ii. You gave the website your cell number when you registered for their service, because they have to comply with anti-money-laundering laws and/or it's in their best interests to require it. In most countries it is illegal to obtain a SIM card without providing identification for records. You pay a web hosting company in BTC to cover your naughty websites dirty tracks. But you were wrong, because you logged in to manage your site many times from IP addresses that you didn't take the appropriate steps to hide or obfuscate. Thus, your ISP and others have details about your connection, usage, and perhaps identity.   These are just some silly examples to show where the flaws of bitcoin anonymity lay. They do not lay intrinsically with bitcoin, but instead with the person using bitcoin. I can move bitcoins from random address A to random address B and it means very little. But there are very few situations where nothing further happens from then on. There has to be a real world start and end point to bitcoin transactions or else the entire thing is just fanciful and serves no purpose.  I suppose I could mine some bitcoin through a tunneled, encrypted, TOR protected connection (or other such nonsense) running through some random Joe's wifi I accessed. That would be almost entirely untraceable. But then what would I do with that bitcoin that I mined? Sooner or later it has to be used for something or else I wasted my time in the first place."

When a bitcoin moves from wallet A to wallet B a public broadcast is made and that coin records the change of wallet.   This is exactly an intrinsic bitcoin mechanic that endangers the anonymity of the transaction. It is diffcult but not impossible to use the public log or seized funds to track transactions between people. This very thread has an example of a bot that reads the public log and uses info you give it to verify a transaction has taken place. It is not correct to advertise this as an ""anonymous"" currency as long as these mechanics exist unless they can also have 100% protection against third party analysis.

Some studies have even been done on the security of this process to determine exactly to the extent that mixing is required in order to consider the source sufficiently obfuscated.  I thought your comment was more about what I tried to elaborate on, but instead you were focusing more on the transfer of balance of addresses which is a concept so basic to bitcoin I did not consider it.

CGPGrey,1kfrj5,Nylund,1 point,Fri Aug 16 00:37:47 2013 UTC,"Bitcoin still confuses most people. Even the long term users. I was mining it when I could mine 1 BTC per day, every day of the week. That was a long time ago, and it still confuses me every now and then.  But on the other hand, we are taught about fiat from a young age. We are taught that some things are more expensive than others (like gold), when we are very young. That being said, how many people learn personal finances at schools in the western world these days? Not many. Fiat is designed to be very simple such that all the common folk can utilise it without too much hassel. Inherently this imposes some limitations. For example if you don't know how to use bitcoin, you might now know of a way to send money internationally with very little fees (as low as it would be for a bitcoin transaction, that is, ie. next to nothing).  I think that in the distant future as we continue to be a technologically driven society, it could potentially be something that it taught to people at a younger age. Then figuring out bitcoin might not be such a hard thing to grasp."

CGPGrey,1kfrj5,Lodley,2,Fri Aug 16 19:16:23 2013 UTC,"For me, the fundamental flaw with bitcoin is that it's inherently deflationary.  The quantity of bitcoins is increasing at a decreasing rate towards a finite limit.  Meanwhile, population and the economy grow.  That means the amount of bitcoins per person (or per transaction) will continually decrease.  This means that bitcoins (were they to catch on) will only go up in value. That's another way of saying that prices must continually go down.  That sounds like a good thing, but it's not.  Why buy something for 10 bitcoins now when it'll only cost 9 next week, 8 the week after, etc. It completely kills the motivation to spend it.  If people aren't spending it, then it doesn't have much use as money.  Or think about a company using it.  They buy inputs for a product at one price, but by the time they assemble and sell the product, since prices have decreased, they may have to sell the product for less bitcoins than what they started with.  They'd be better off not making or selling anything, but just sitting on any bitcoins already in their possession.  And think about what that means for borrowing, lending, debts, etc. Interest rates would have to be negative if it's deflationary.  If you borrowed bitcoins, you'd have to pay back the loan in even more valuable bit coins.  Even with an interest rate of zero, if the rate of deflation is high enough, it could kill the cost of borrowing (which is a crucial part of business operations), and could never go negative since lenders would then just opt to hold their bitcoins (in effect accepting a zero percent interest rate from themselves).  In other words, if the world really operated based on a deflationary currency then all business would come to a halt since no one would ever be able to borrow to start a new company and no one would want to spend their bitcoins on anything since they'll be more valuable in the future.  The irony being that if no one wants to conduct business with them then they'll lose all value since a bitcoin has no intrinsic value.  It's value hinges entirely on mutually shared acceptance that it's a medium of exchange that can be exchanged at a future date for goods and services (that actually do have intrinsic value).  If it fails as a medium of exchange, then it has no value, and it will fail as a medium of exchange since it's inherently deflationary.  When everyone from Milton Friedman, to Paul Krugman, to F. A. Hayek all write about the problems of deflation, one should take note.  It leads to nothing but hoarding and idle money that helps no one.  Note, short periods of deflation, while generally not good, aren't entirely terrible.  It's the fact that it's perpetually deflationary and leads to continually changing prices that causes the problems."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,salakasto,4,Thu Aug 22 01:02:02 2013 UTC,"Why buy something for 10 bitcoins now when it'll only cost 9 next week, 8 the week after, etc. It completely kills the motivation to spend it.   Why do people constantly buy new technology and electronics, when prices of those are always going down? Why are people spending money from their savings accounts when that money increases in value 1% to 3%? Somehow they are all still motivated.   They buy inputs for a product at one price, but by the time they assemble and sell the product, since prices have decreased, they may have to sell the product for less bitcoins than what they started with.   That's true. So they better make some REALLY nice products with high quality and profit margins, instead of cheap crap that breaks within a week. Or, you know, everyone's prices will simply adjust to compensate for the deflation, since everyone else will deal with this same issue.   And think about what that means for borrowing, lending, debts, etc.    Oh god if we could only decrease the amount of borrowing, and increase the amount people are saving. There is so much debt in the world, and, as least in USA, something like 75% of people who reach 65 have less than $100k in their savings, meaning they have to rely on everyone else to support them through retirement. If people put off buying because things are cheaper later, things would be so much better in the world!   Interest rates would have to be negative if it's deflationary.   Not at all! If the loan or investment is 6%, and bitcoins are deflating t 3%, you would simply have to pay or earn 6% - 3% = 3%. It just means that only really good qualify and well researched investments would get funding, ad, again, more people would choose to save, instead of rely on credit cards.   no one would ever be able to borrow to start a new company   Plenty of companies earn 6% to 12% returns. Venture Investors demand 20% to 50%. That's way more than bitcoin is expected to deflate at.   The irony being that if no one wants to conduct business with them then they'll lose all value since a bitcoin has no intrinsic value.   They can't both continue to gain value (deflate) AND lose value. At some point they will have to come to an equilibrium, where their value is not growing, or dropping, and people are spending them.   It leads to nothing but hoarding   You know that ""hoarding"" is just another word for ""saving,"" right?"
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,l1ghtning,1 point,Thu Aug 22 03:42:15 2013 UTC,"Hoarding and saving are not the same thing.  By hoarding, I mean something akin to ""stuck under the mattress"" or ""buried in a tin can in the yard.""  It implies unproductive ""savings.""  I'd distinguish this from ""productive savings.""  The money I ""save"" whether it's in the stock market ,a savings account, or in bonds (be they municipal, corporate, or whatever) is money that other people are borrowing.  One person's debt is another person's asset.  There are real debt problems, but I think they're better fixed by ending the tax preference given to interest on debt than by creating a deflationary currency.  Also, purely as an accounting identity, total income equals total spending.  If people spend less in aggregate, then income, in aggregate must also decrease.  I'm actually not that opposed to a world where less is produced, less is bought, and less money is earned, but it should give people some pause.  There is an ""optimal"" savings rate.  I have no doubt we are below it right now, but it's also possible to be above it.  And you're interest rates are ridiculous.  Sure, some things do get returns like that.  They're not that uncommon, but they also aren't ""the norm.""  Second, those are nominal interest rates that also factor in the current inflation rate.  If you switch from an inflation rate of +2% to a deflationary rate of -3%, it's a change of 5%, not 3%.  And speaking of nominal, can you imagine contracts in a perpetually deflationary world?  Are workers going to be cool with nominal salary cuts, less bitcoins per year, even if those fewer bitcoins actually have more value?  I also think they can both gain value and lose value. Granted, not at the same time.  I think what you'd see is an economy-stifling bout of deflation.  Once the value increased to a certain amount, holders would then dump them (or go on a spending spree) and create a bout of hyper-inflation, at which point the cycle would restart.  I think the ideal monetary system should be one that has relatively stale prices, but given that the economy changes, that means money supply has to change to counteract such fluctuations.  The bitcoin supply is so rigidly controlled that it'll actually lead to very volatile prices.  As an aside, I disagree with the notion that it's highly decentralized.  I'd argue the opposite. It's a highly centralized form of money supply.  Some person (or people), many years ago decided in perpetuity how exactly the money supply would change over time.  We'd all be forever enslaved to the decision of those few (or sole?) people for ever and ever.  If Bernanke ever said, ""I'm going to determine the money supply, not just for now, but forever, and no one can change my rule, even after I die,"" I don't think ""freedom"" or ""de-centralized"" are the words people would use to describe it."

And you're interest rates are ridiculous. Sure, some things do get returns like that. They're not that uncommon, but they also aren't ""the norm.""    The market as a whole has a long-tern interest return rate of 10% to 12%, so I consider that ""the norm.""   If you switch from an inflation rate of +2% to a deflationary rate of -3%, it's a change of 5%, not 3%.   Oops, you're right. So a 6% return in a 3% inflationary economy is 0% in a 3% deflationary economy....   And speaking of nominal, can you imagine contracts in a perpetually deflationary world?   Actually I can. Short term, with periodic payments calculated to be the same in actual value, meaning higher at the beginning in nominal value, and decreasing over time. Thing is, in a deflationary world, everyone would be dealing with deflation, so everyone would account for interest changes related to it.   Are workers going to be cool with nominal salary cuts, less bitcoins per year, even if those fewer bitcoins actually have more value?   At first, no, but they'll have to get used to it. Most likely what will happen is, instead of how it is now:   Worker gets hired for an indefinite period, continues earning a salary year after year, and hopes to get a raise every year to keep up with inflation, but having no guarantee of being able to renegotiate his value-decreasing contract   it will be   Worker gets hired for a year-long contract for a specific salary. At the end of the year, worker's performance is reviewed, and he gets rehired for another year, for a lower nominal, but similar actual value, or an increased value, contract. If worker is hired indefinitely, company will just end up paying him more and more in actual value automatically every year. Basically, workers win because the people they work with are forced to reevaluate their pay, instead of pushing raises to the next year every year, and employees win, because workers have an incentive to demonstrate that they deserve to continue their salary at the same or increased rate.   We've discussed all of this rather in depth on the bitcointalk forums :)   I think the ideal monetary system should be one that has relatively stale prices, but given that the economy changes, that means money supply has to change to counteract such fluctuations. The bitcoin supply is so rigidly controlled that it'll actually lead to very volatile prices.   Well, then I guess we're all fucked, because bitcoin isn't going anywhere, and is convenient enough to maybe, just maybe, eventually replace many other currencies :/   If Bernanke ever said, ""I'm going to determine the money supply, not just for now, but forever, and no one can change my rule, even after I die,"" I don't think ""freedom"" or ""de-centralized"" are the words people would use to describe it.   There's one very important difference: No one is forcing anyone to use bitcoin. If Bernanke said that, and US government forced everyone to use it, that'd be one thing. But Bitcoin is winning because people are voluntarily choosing to adopt it. That's also why it's decentralized: it's not something imposed on everyone by a central authority. People are free to choose between Bitcoin, and a slew of other cryptocurrencies, including inflationary ones (they exist), and support them individually, in a decentralized manner."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,tjb0607,1 point,Thu Aug 22 19:49:20 2013 UTC,"Regarding the interest tax preference, I actually had businesses in mind, specifically the way debt is used by private equity firms, leverages buyouts, etc.  Consumer debt is bad, but its the use of debt to leverage positions by the big players that create the more systemic risk.  another  quibble: ""The market as a whole has a long-tern interest return rate of 10% to 12%, so I consider that ""the norm.""  I'm assuming you're talking annualized rates since we were using annual inflation rates.  The average annual rate of return for the S&P 500 from 2001 - 2011 was 2.92%.  Subtract out inflation, and you're pretty close to nada.  Put deflation in there and the rate of return is negative.  Granted, over longer time frames or different year spans (aka, ones that don't include financial crises) the numbers look a little better.  Still, those rates are by holding pretty risky assets.  For people, say the elderly, who are in capital preservation mode, the return on ""safe"" assets isn't going to be anything close to 10% per year.  I'm also skeptical that your employment scenario would ever catch on.  Initially, when the vast majority of people are used to the current system with relative job security and nominal wage increases, it'll be hard to convince anyone but die-hard bitcoin fanatics that they should accept a short-term contract, then, after that, resign another one that pays a smaller nominal amount.  Most people aren't terribly financially literate.  I really doubt, ""trust me, it's a smaller number, but it'll be worth more!"" is going to sit well with your average low-skilled worker."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,Zagorath,2,Wed Sep 18 20:52:34 2013 UTC,"I just listened to your talk with Brady Haran on being wrong on the internet and as much as it sounds like criticism of this sort provokes anxiety, I finally felt up to writing a response to this little talk on Bitcoin.  I know you are (or at least were) excited about Bitcoin and a lot of people have been, but I think it is worthwhile to think a bit about money, debt, and some of the serious deficiencies systems like Bitcoin have compared to other currencies. I will use the term Bitcoin specifically because I like it better than 'cryptocurrency' and because the proliferation of these systems may mean that some attempt to address some of these concerns.  I can distill the features which draw people to Bitcoin down to the ability to perform secure, inexpensive transactions without government or corporate oversight (including some degree of anonymity), and an unmanaged, eventually fixed currency supply free of inflationary manipulation. While both of these sound good for people who distrust (often with good cause) the powerful people in charge of our money supplies, both of these primary features of Bitcoin come at some very large costs.  Having an intermediary overseeing transactions who can reverse them is extremely valuable. There is a reason that people on Craigslist are discouraged from transacting in cash, it is because the properties of cash make it difficult to reverse transactions if the non-cash part of the transaction turns out to be fraudulent. Bitcoin is very much like cash in this regard as the system is designed to severely limit the window where transactions can be cancelled and obscure the identities of the persons transacting. This greatly improves the security for the person receiving currency in a transaction at a cost of security for the person receiving the non-currency component. Transaction intermediaries who the ability to reverse currency transactions and easily identify in retrospect the identities of the participants provides a good for consumers which is lost or at the very least made much more cumbersome and expensive for consumers under Bitcoin. Yes, there is fraud which is committed using transaction reversal, but Bitcoin doesn't fix this without throwing out a lot of value in the process.  Fixed, unmanaged currencies lack both active and passive systems which improve currency stability and have inherent problems which make instability crises worse when compared to modern currency systems.  Economic systems benifit from and suffer from feedback loops where economic activity might inhibit or promote other similar economic activity; here is one such feedback loop. As economic activity increases, more transactions occur to transfer greater amounts of value. This increases the demand for currency used to perform these transactions. With a fixed currency supply and increasing currency demand, the price of currency goes up and so the amount of stuff a unit of currency will buy goes down, meaning that there is price deflation. If you are holding onto cash in a situation and are presented with an investment opportunity, being rational, you would calculate the opportunity cost of your investmet to be higher if the value of your cash is going up and thus demand a higher return on that investment. Under deflation, fewer investments are going to beat just sitting on your cash, there is less investment, so the economic growth slows down. It is very difficult to grow an economy with a fixed currency and it tends to do so in fits and starts.  Compare this to the current standard for currency. A modern unit of currency is created whole cloth when a loan is made by an entity which follows certain accounting rules. These units of currency are fungible, but (barring counterfeit notes and undetected fraud) all of the money will be destroyed as the principal of the loans is repaid. As it relates to this topic, the money supply can grow and shrink with economic growth automatically. If the economy is growing, then more people will be credit-worthy and as they qualify for loans, more money gets created. The accredited institutions which make these loans should be properly regulated to ensure that they will honor bad debts they have underwritten (although failures in some of these regulation schemes are a major reason for the popularity of Bitcoin). A major benifit of our currency system is its ability to adapt to economic circumstance.  Another example of an economic feedback loop is the recession trap. Reduced economic activity causes a reduction in wages which reduces consumption which reduces economic activity. There are additional loops related to this such as reduced consumption reduces future economic output which increases loan risk which raises interest rates which reduces economic investment which reduces wages which reduces consumption. Problems such as this can be fixed in many ways, but the most politically prudent way has often been to manipulate currency markets to reduce interest rates to maintain economic activity. In a fixed currency economy this problem runs away withitself, but our currencies have levers (admittedly insufficient) which can work counter to the effect.  There is also the question of the basis of value for Bitcoin. Many who support Bitcoin base this on the idea that currency doesn't have any fundamental value and is only a shared means of exchange, but this is a misconception. Currencies have value because you have a reasonable expectation that you can trade them for stuff you want when you want it. For government-backed currencies, this isn't just some nebulous social contract, but a very real proposition as governments levy taxes in their currency and in modern times enforce that debts in the currency are repaid by some party (usually either the debtor or the underwriting institution). This means that if I take some currency in exchange for some value, I can base the value of that currency on the assurance that the government backing it will motivate tax-payers and debtors to negotiate with me to get this currency in exchange for some other value, perhaps by threatening to forceably take the liberty or property of those people. Bitcoin has no such assurance of future demand other than the hope that people will keep believing in the story of Bitcoin.  Finally, there is the question of whether Bitcoin can even really stay fixed. Government currencies today have their roots in mostly fixed assets and much of the innovation in currency was an evolutionary process from those systems. If I make a loan denominated in Bitcoin and I start trading the note of this loan as effectively a futures contract for actual Bitcoin for real value which I can calculate in Bitcoin, then I have effectively created a shadow-currency which behaves like and can be regulated like government currencies today. In fact, without the ability to trade loans in this manner, the risk of generating loans would increase and that would further reduce the ability for the economy to grow and be more productive. Eventually, the market for Bitcoin derivatives could eclipse the actual Bitcoin market, which would largely be controlled by a few large lending institutions and governments, just like it did for gold and silver currencies.  Bitcoin, ultimately, is a story about a post-government world where people transact on a human level with other people without the obtrusive interference of our bureaucratic overlords. This is a story of which I am extremely sympathetic, but I am concerned that so many people want to be part of that story that they are taking bad notions of economics to fuel what I believe to be a doomed project kept afloat by hopes and dreams."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,timverma,2,Thu Feb 6 19:49:33 2014 UTC,"Bitcoin being used for illicit transactions is only a tiny problem in the boondoggle that is Bitcoin. The two central claimed benefits of these digital currencies are immunity from government interference (including tracking of transactions) and stability are not only at odds with each other, there is nothing about the structure of the system which actually results in either of these being sustainable. The value of Bitcoin is entirly based on a wide-spread misunderstanding of what money is and how it gains and maintains value and the ideological hope of the anti-establishment to wrest control of the economic process from an established power.  The greatest shame is that sooner or later a lot of well-meaning people are going to be hit hard by the failure of this ill-devised scheme and those of you with higher podiums who called them to what is ultimately the slaughter when you should have known better will bear much of the blame."

What small business owner wouldn't want that kind of boost in margins?   Author missed a huge point here. It's not the lower transaction fees that are the real win for small business owners; it's the lack of chargebacks. Chargebacks hurt businesses much more than transaction fees.

Assuming the merchant really did dispense goods or services at the time they originally charged your card, this means that the merchant has lost both the merchandise and the money. These losses add up and contribute significantly to the merchant's cost of doing business, sometimes as much as 20%. With Bitcoin, chargebacks are impossible. Merchants that accept only Bitcoin in payment never lose anything to chargebacks, and consequently their costs are lower, and they are able to offer lower prices on their merchandise. This is how BitcoinStore is able to beat Amazon's and NewEgg's prices despite having much lesser sales volumes. BitcoinStore doesn't have to eat the costs associated with chargebacks."

Charities receive that money, not knowing it was stolen, and spend it on operating costs.

Bitcoin is a perfect opportunity for those lucky enough to have dibs on using it first to be the richest people alive if it became popular, and wealth would not and could never be distributed properly because of the lack of control of the currency. Basically, Bitcoin itself is a business in which only its earliest and smartest investors could take advantage of, and leave the rest in poverty.  Don't get me wrong, digital currency is cool and all, but Bitcoin is not. The set amount of Bitcoins and the anonymity of transactions leads the most corrupt people to succeed merely because of their skills in being able to work the system. Think of bankers or conglomerate company owners, who make all their money off of working the system to their benefit, not by working hard.   The influence of governments on economies and currencies is insignificant compared to the influence private banks and financial institutions have on it. In fact, what governments do more than anything is support these institutions that keep these economic problems going.  Not to mention Bitcoin is extremely unstable. The currency itself is one giant chance-taker, and the amount of money you have depends not so much on how much work you do, but how well you can survive within a Bitcoin-dominated system. Bitcoin operates like the stock market, except in a Bitcoin world, everyone would own stocks, so a fluctuation in Bitcoin worth would directly affect everyone much more than a fluctuation in purchasing power of a dollar or euro or pound, especially since, in the most desperate of times, you can create a new currency artificially.  The anonymous nature of Bitcoin also allows for undetected transactions that are much worse than those you describe in this article, which can include selling weapons or basically owning slaves. This happens all around the world, but they are easily detected in developed countries because of the tight watch on transactions. Now, of course, governments can be corrupt and arrest certain people for buying and selling things, and not detain others (think embezzlement vs. buying drugs), but that's a problem with the elitist nature of many governments themselves and the ability of private entities to give to the ones controlling governments and sway their opinions.  So, basically, digital currency is cool, but Bitcoin is a horrible way of implementing it. It's bad news for all sorts of reasons."

Lawrence Lessig made a point once about how BMI was founded (with cheap, knock-off music product) which (he claims) still destroyed ASCAP's ability to have monopoly pricing.  I don't know if Lessig knows squat about copyright licensing (I jest!!) or if I've captured the essence of his argument correctly.   Bitcoin, in it's unregulated state, allows for very low cost transactions.  However I don't think it stops Paypal from lowering its transactions costs to try to compete.  Perhaps even by out-right copying some of the bitcoin model, but adding a central authority of some kind.  It seems to me that the most important aspect of Bitcoin is the decentralized, non-regulatable aspect (which is partly fallacy, I'm sure.  Governments will find ways to regulate access to bitcoin, even if not 100% effective, that will be effective enough).  But you seem to be saying that the most important thing is the reduced transaction cost.  We could have that in the US if the Treasury and the Fed were to agree on a new digital currency!  And it would have a huge market advantage, I would think over Bitcoin.    Unrelated: Is anyone else worried that Bitcoins will eventually run out?  We can only mine so many, and after 500 years or so, spread out over 20 billion people, won't some of them lose the keys to their wallet, leaving those bitcoin complete out of circulation?  There's no way in the BT model to capture uncirculating currency, that I know of.  Is this a lame point or an interesting one to anyone else?"

CGPGrey,1kfrj5,Slyer,1 point,Tue Oct 8 12:48:17 2013 UTC,I think that bit coins will eventually shut down the banking industry. As payment for labor and services become digitized bit coins will gain popularity(about 90% of today's money is digital and backed up on servers). This is basically a service in which no one company can control so they cannot charge what ever ridiculous surcharge
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,aliencupcake,1 point,Sun Nov 24 06:45:55 2013 UTC,"Can someone take me through the bitcoin experience, starting with my giving money to someone, where ever they are, then my finding something to buy (again where and how) or selling something on the Internet and someone paying for it in bitcoin and then how do I collect the bbitcoin and then turn it into cash at my bank to put into my account.  Do banks accept bitcoin deposits?  If someone wants to tackle these issues you can contact me at www.waterbag.com.  Thanks, Terry Spragg"
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,sunzoo,-1,Mon Dec 2 03:04:19 2013 UTC,"While Bitcoin may have potential, there was a point when a single Bitcoin was affordable. Anecdotally, this is part of how the man who writes XKCD got rich: buying them when they were cheap. However, Bitcoin is beginning to collapse under it's own weight. Bitcoins are now measured by the thousandths. That says something, right there.  Bitcoin is going to go downhill before it changes the world, Colin, and like the internet, it's not going to look anything like it does now when it does it.  As for the negative connotations, I think a good example of this is 4chan. 4chan is a website where kind of messed up things happen pretty constantly, and really, really messed up things happen occasionally. Because of this, people see 4chan as an untamed, secret internet hacker's club (for example, there's a distressing amount of people who think ""Anonymous"" is a thing), just because users occasionally drop the Orbital Drop Strike Canon. While 4chan certainly is thing that probably should have a negative connotation, it's the same sort of mentality behind disliking Bitcoins. With 4chan, for every horrible cp thread on /b/ there's a bunch of idiots arguing about bad music on /mu/ and making tasteless jokes on /pol/; and for every drug deal that goes down on The Silk Road, there's a guy forwarding you a dollar over a strange internet robot because he liked your comment."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,Slyer,7,Thu Aug 15 19:43:37 2013 UTC,"Your purchasing power hasn't disappeared. Buy $10 BTC today, and you will reasonably be able to spend $10 worth of BTC towards goods. If you bought it at $266, and subsequently lost the value when it crashed, that might have sucked, but generally it is fine.  Also, what's wrong with rewarding early adopters? They took the biggest risk, and they got rewarded."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,l1ghtning,1 point,Thu Aug 15 19:58:09 2013 UTC,"This is what I tell everyone who is concerned about Bitcoin value fluctuation.  In reality we are a long way from our employers paying us in Bitcoins.  Until then, Bitcoins are simply a vehicle for transferring wealth.  If you do the conversion from your currency to Bitcoin and then in turn to the seller's currency at time of the transaction, then there is no need to be concerned about price.  That said, until the cost of converting USD, for example) to BTC and back again is low enough, it is still a barrier for its use outside the Bitcoin mining and investor communities.  It is THOSE communities who are affected by price fluctuations."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,BigKev47,-2,Wed Aug 21 21:55:04 2013 UTC,"The problem lies with the fact there's nobody the free market hates more than the early adopter. If you bought an iPhone when it first came out, you're probably disappointed whenever you see someone with a brand-spankin' new iPhone 5, with it's superior technology and more optimized apps. If you bought an Xbox 360 when it first came out, there's a high likelyhood it got the RRoD and you had to buy a new one. This has gone on throughout history, and despite depending entirely on early adopters, content and culture creators by nature hate the early adopter."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,Deleetdk,5,Thu Aug 15 20:03:06 2013 UTC,"Someone has to be first for someone else to be second. One can hate on people buying Google stock early, getting into the Internet before the .com bubble, getting onto the iPhone app market early, but someone had to get this started otherwise it would never happen.  There is also a notion that util Bitcoins are worth 100+x what they currently are, everyone is still an early adopter."
CGPGrey,1kfrj5,zebulo,7,Thu Aug 15 20:17:34 2013 UTC,"I hate how whenever I make an argument on this subreddit, no matter how well-spoken (or rather well-typed) it is, people still use the downvote as a disagree button. I'll just stick to circle-jerking and one-liners, thank you.  I'm not saying that early adopters are bad. I'm saying that they're damned. They're damned because they are the test audience; the people who are hurt worst when something gets big (with exception, like the .com bubble). So no, I'm not saying it's bad to adopt early, I'm saying be prepared for the worst."

CGPGrey,1jkp7h,iBeReese,4,Sat Aug 3 04:21:08 2013 UTC,"Hello Grey, HAL here. I was going to recommend Google Checkout, but sadly, it's just as expensive as Paypal, which I understand you loathe for that reason. Still, if Amazon can't fix its problem, maybe you should still look into that? It might be an option especially for those ready to give a one-time donation rather than a monthly subscription. Also, you might want to consider flattr.com, as it gives people who already have money in their flattr-account the option to circumvent further fees.  Hope this helps! Also, I wanted to share another thought: At least in Germany, all important weekly newspapers have a science part that will probably love to feature you. The one I read daily appears particularly desparate: Articles about poet's favorite trees, how the archaeopteryx would look like if painted by a 12 year old, and so on. This could instantly catapult you to over 1m subscribers and definitely fetch paying subscribers."

CGPGrey,1jkp7h,kaninglamig,5,Sun Aug 4 11:37:29 2013 UTC,"Thank you.  I'm thinking of writing and article or posting a video about this sometime but the short answer is that often simply trying to coordinate volunteers takes more time than doing something on my own.

CGPGrey,1jcwh7,Littleme02,12,Wed Jul 31 02:16:54 2013 UTC,"Yup. Basically, Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency. You can think of it like cash, but digital. I sent some of this cash to /u/bitcointip ahead of time, and it's holding it for me. When I give that command, I'm basically telling it to give some of that cash to CGPGrey.  In reality, the bot will be holding on to what I gave until the person I gave it to claims it and asks the bot to give it to him. He can then go spend it on stuff (Reddit Gold, for one. Also domain names, hosting services, and some other stuff.), or go to an exchange and trade it for US Dollars or British Pounds or whatever. Like any currency, there's an exchange rate that moves around depending on various economic factors. The bot keeps track of this exchange rate, so when I say to give $5, it figures out how much $5 is worth in Bitcoin, and gives CGPGrey that much for me.  I hope that explains it. I'm nowhere near as good at explaining stuff as CGPGrey is (thus the tip). http://bitcoin.org is a good resource for Bitcoin in general, and /r/bitcointip is the subreddit for the bot. /u/NerdfighterSean wrote the bot, so he'd probably know the details more than I do."

CGPGrey,1jcwh7,someenigma,3,Sat Aug 3 00:11:22 2013 UTC,"I tried to watch it yesterday, but couldn't I think I missed it. Is it up somewhere?"
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,frieswithketchup,2,Tue Jul 30 19:08:04 2013 UTC,I couldn't find it anywhere. Sorry. Looks like he didn't post a recording (or however that works) this time.
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,aeramor,2,Wed Jul 31 02:52:34 2013 UTC,"Darn, well thanks for looking.Did you watch it? What is it about?"
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,PopeMuffin,6,Wed Jul 31 04:27:45 2013 UTC,Thanks for your videos.  How much does a single cup of joe cost you in your favorite shops?   Perhaps we can have something similar to the Big Mac index for your videos.   Alternative Vote Explained - 97 cups Coffee: The Greatest Addiction Ever - 100 cups How to Become Pope - 200 cups
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,Jamesofur,17,Tue Jul 30 17:25:35 2013 UTC,I don't think I want to know how many cups those two London videos were.
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,Trapacity,1 point,Tue Jul 30 17:34:09 2013 UTC,"Your London videos were the best and well worth however much coffee you needed to ingest.   I moved here a year ago, and have had many visitors from the States since but before anyone comes to visit me I assign them the UK Explained, and both London videos. It's a fantastic introduction not only to London but to your videos because they always want to watch more!  Thanks so much for creating such quality content, I'm really pleased to support!"
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,DictatorDono,6,Wed Jul 31 13:29:38 2013 UTC,Hopefully you and the Brothers Green are  paving a path to a better brighter more enriching system for all of us.
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,treenaks,13,Tue Jul 30 17:36:07 2013 UTC,So.. a greener future?
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,western_style_hj,15,Tue Jul 30 20:50:56 2013 UTC,"No, a greyer future!"
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,drewtheoverlord,5,Wed Jul 31 02:15:46 2013 UTC,"I don't have a ton of money to spare, but I accidentally worked an extra half hour at my hourly job the other day, so I donated what I earned to you. Enjoy the coffee, dude."
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,theonesean,8,Tue Jul 30 19:17:13 2013 UTC,That you so much.  That really means a lot to donate in such a direct way.
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,joshs2,4,Tue Jul 30 23:30:42 2013 UTC,"Have you considered using Flattr links? I would gladly click everytime a video is released. I don´t want subscriber perks, just keep up the great work."
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,NowWeAreAllTom,5,Tue Jul 30 17:34:16 2013 UTC,"My first thought was flattr, too. It's already established in terms of podcasts, blogposts and other things, so it seemed to me like they were reinventing the wheel with subbable.    But oh well, I support the idea behind flattr, I don't insist on using flattr exclusively. In the end, it's about the content we want to support."
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,PurpleMistet,2,Tue Jul 30 23:42:09 2013 UTC,"You might like this comparison of the two in a Reddit comment by John Green, Subbable co-founder."

CGPGrey,1jcwh7,MrDNL,6,Tue Jul 30 18:22:36 2013 UTC,The money is raised in dollars but my expenses are in pounds.
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,MrDNL,11,Tue Jul 30 20:12:06 2013 UTC,"As a person that has also straddled living between the US and another country, have you kept your American citizenship or have you gave it up due to the mind boggling tax situation expats have to face?"
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,derpasarous,5,Tue Jul 30 20:52:33 2013 UTC,"I think you made a typo in the description of the ""postcard"" perk:   ""The postcard will have a waiving CGPGrey on the front.""   You also alternate between ""postcard"" and ""post card""</stylenazi>"

You do an excellent job"
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,p_ireland,6,Tue Jul 30 23:40:29 2013 UTC,I would love to help you and considering i have adblock installed i will send you 10$ per month
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,Xsinthis,3,Tue Jul 30 19:32:30 2013 UTC,Thank you: that more than covers your adblock usage in my mind.
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,HankMcCoy7410,1 point,Tue Jul 30 20:24:39 2013 UTC,Also congratulations on reaching your goal!
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,Jammie98,4,Tue Jul 30 23:32:27 2013 UTC,"Subbable doesn't seem to represent very many creators, or am I just not finding them very effectively? I'd want to donate small amounts to tons of YouTube educators.  Veritasium, Numberphile, vsauce etc  Also they should change their FAQ. A witty FAQ is fine but it's too heavy with abrasive jokes that its just annoying to read."
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,ratsock,5,Tue Jul 30 23:46:24 2013 UTC,It just launched.  There should be more people in the coming days.  Stay tuned.
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,Perpetual_Entropy,2,Tue Jul 30 21:57:02 2013 UTC,"On this note, did you try to join up, or did they approach you?  I have a few youtubers I follow who I'd like to point towards Subbable but I don't know if they take just anyone, or whether they approach people."
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,Fenrakk101,3,Tue Jul 30 23:38:07 2013 UTC,"They approached me, but there is an application form somewhere on the website."
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,Netsirk2,3,Wed Jul 31 00:16:52 2013 UTC,"Subbable is new. Like one week old new.  The Green Brothers started with one of their own channels and want to add more over time. I actually didn't expect them to add someone else's channel on there for a bit longer.  With the succesful funding of CGPGrey within 5hours, I'm sure they will add more channels soon."
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,AbominablePacMan,3,Wed Jul 31 00:20:29 2013 UTC,"Wow, seems you have a great bunch of followers. When I saw your video there were 4500 views and 3200 subscribers (including me :p ) Keep up the great work.  Out of curiosity; what is the split you have with subbable?"
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,CPGGREYRULES,3,Tue Jul 30 22:09:56 2013 UTC,"Subbable takes 5%, Amazon takes 5% and the rest goes to me.    There isn't a better deal on the Internet for content creators."
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,ecatsuj,5,Tue Jul 30 22:22:43 2013 UTC,"My teacher showed your UK video in Pollitics, he's a great fan :D, he said if you done something like Subble he would donate, I hope he does, I'm going to soon :D"
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,IsaacNK,4,Tue Jul 30 23:41:09 2013 UTC,Time to subscribe and save up perk points to order a donation link to my employer/hobby (Wikimedia/Wikipedia ) during fundraising season :) . A bunch of us get excited every time we see a new video whether we're in the office/ hanging out outside or just chatting online together. Anything to help keep it up!
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,Fenrakk101,5,Tue Jul 30 23:42:34 2013 UTC,"Will you be doing another Q&A when you hit 1,000,000 subscribers? I think it'd be awesome."
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,the_rural_juror7,1 point,Tue Jul 30 23:56:52 2013 UTC,Possibly. That number is so overwhelming it's hard to think of what to do.
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,CPGGREYRULES,1 point,Wed Jul 31 00:05:04 2013 UTC,"Maybe you could do a Vlog, since your now doing this full time? Or do you prefer the whole stick figure method?"

CGPGrey,1jcwh7,teh_killer,3,Tue Jul 30 20:12:23 2013 UTC,"I'm very excited about Subbable and I'm also very excited about your videos, so naturally I'm in. $5 a month for now sounds good to me.  I'd rather pay for great stuff with money than with ad impressions."

CGPGrey,1jcwh7,Guysmiley777,3,Tue Jul 30 18:14:22 2013 UTC,"When Subbable first came about I couldn't really think of any channel I actually wanted to give my money to, but the minute I saw your tweet about joining I just knew that I had to donate. Thank you for making amazing content, and I hope this works out for you so you can have a more financially stable present and future."

CGPGrey,1jcwh7,highoctanecaffeine,3,Tue Jul 30 18:35:56 2013 UTC,I didn't realise you quit your day job to become a full time youtuber that explains why there have been so many videos recently
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,nickjhowe,3,Tue Jul 30 18:16:11 2013 UTC,"Just donated $4 for a cup of coffee! Stay classy, Grey! Your videos are an inspiration!"
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,bohemianboycatiiic,2,Tue Jul 30 18:36:12 2013 UTC,Thank you.
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,bohemianboycatiiic,3,Tue Jul 30 18:45:22 2013 UTC,So when can i expect to see my poster? As you are now 30$ richer... (Or approx. 20 cups of coffee where i live)
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,guspaz,4,Tue Jul 30 18:59:53 2013 UTC,"Thanks for ordering it.  The posters are still in the design phase (and then they have to get to me to be signed) so the answer is as soon as possible, but probably not very soon."
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,bkirow,1 point,Tue Jul 30 23:29:28 2013 UTC,ok thanks for the answer and being awesome
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,aWildNacatl,1 point,Tue Jul 30 19:01:04 2013 UTC,I also ordered a poster. Any idea on what the size will be? I am assuming it will not be that big since it was only $30.
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,taubot,3,Tue Jul 30 23:30:12 2013 UTC,Subscribed.  Sip your coffee and ponder.
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,moepwizzy,2,Wed Jul 31 03:24:41 2013 UTC,Will do!
CGPGrey,1jcwh7,JackGravity,3,Wed Jul 31 04:07:22 2013 UTC,Put in $5.
