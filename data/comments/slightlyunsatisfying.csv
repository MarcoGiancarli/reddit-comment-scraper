slightlyunsatisfying,25n5s1,musicaficta,10,Thu May 15 17:54:32 2014 UTC,This is a double pendulum. Anyone who has studied Newtonian mechanics will have come across this. It's a good example of a system that is governed by simple rules but which exhibits chaotic behaviour.
slightlyunsatisfying,25n5s1,solve-for-x,4,Thu May 15 19:55:14 2014 UTC,"Double pendulum:       In physics and mathematics, in the area of dynamical systems, a double pendulum is a pendulum with another pendulum attached to its end, and is a simple physical system that exhibits rich dynamic behavior with a strong sensitivity to initial conditions.  The motion of a double pendulum is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations. For certain energies its motion is chaotic.    Image i - A double pendulum consists of two pendulums attached end to end.

slightlyunsatisfying,25n5s1,autowikibot,2,Thu May 15 19:55:56 2014 UTC,"It should be noted that it's a double pendulum with no external forces added to it! If there were any external forces, the system would lack the property of topological transitivity, which would mean it wouldn't be chaotic at all.  (For those that don't know, topological transitivity is the property of a function that makes it so that any interval will eventually end up in any other interval given enough iterations of the function. In this example, it means that eventually all points that the end can mouse over will eventually be done, meaning most of the screen would eventually turn black)."
