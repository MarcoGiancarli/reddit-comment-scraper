His twitter has nothing, maybe his instagram (https://instagram.com/martinheathglobal/) here has something.  As for who to order from, as suggested Scott Jones is great, pretty pricey but really good stuff.  http://archive.automotophoto.com is also really good.  http://gallery.cormacgp.com is good and probably the most affordable of the three.   All three are active on twitter and their Facebook pages so pretty easy to contact."

motogp,3e0qbi,ross_rossifumi,2,Tue Jul 21 06:45:49 2015 UTC,But then of course riders would have changed their race tactics if that had of been the point scoring method.
motogp,3e0qbi,montyzac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:01:24 2015 UTC,I do like the way it is with: 3;1;6;3;1 :D  But this would take away from the strategy part and them just attacking each other like crazy.
motogp,3e0qbi,servenToGo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:27:40 2015 UTC,"Here's a neat thought experiment for how the 2013 season could have turned out.  The most startling discrepancy might have be the consistency that Lorenzo displayed when leading the race compared to Marquez's consistency at the finish line. In a points per lap scenario Lorenzo would dominate.  Here I've pre-populated some points values for completing a lap at certain positions, higher being better. You can play around with these to see how riders might benefit. This imagined scenario would give incentive to riders to race hard for the front throughout the race. At the same time, we slightly diminish the penalty for crashing out - riders would still get points for completed laps.  In these numbers all of Marquez's laps are vacated at Philip Island due to the DQ.  The rider that most benefits? Bryan Staring!    Edit: Another interesting fact is that Colin Edwards completed the second most laps overall in 2013. First was Andrea Dovizioso."

motogp,3e0qbi,dustyshelves,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:07:39 2015 UTC,"Interesting but doesn't really show much since they don't really mind being behind a guy as long as they aren't getting much pressure from behind.  I'm not sure which series it is since it's one I've seen but don't follow, maybe Nascar, where the guy who lead the most laps for a race gets some amount of points.  I think that would do a good job of making them scrap a bit more for the lead if it was worth something like 4-5 points."
motogp,3e0qbi,Wicksy92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:24:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is interesting for sure how this point system would change the strategy of the riders bc as you said, currently, they don't mind being behind another rider for most of the race, saving tyre, learning his line and weaknesses, before attacking in the final laps.   Talking about point systems, I do think a point should be given for setting the fastest lap, breaking the circuit best lap record, etc. Those just sorta seem to mean nothing but footnotes currently."
motogp,3e0qbi,Wicksy92,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:16:16 2015 UTC,"A bonus point for fastest lap would be ok but I would be worried that backmarker (in a hypothetical situation) may just pit in from 15th, stick on some super softs and just do a qualifying run in the end of the race.

motogp,3dsv0x,exg,0,Mon Jul 20 22:23:42 2015 UTC,I've got a mechanical engineering degree so I don't consider myself to be a layman.
motogp,3dsv0x,Through_The_Wire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:09:24 2015 UTC,"Ballast won't have the same effect if it's placed in different positions. The lower the center of mass, the better, as it means less lean angle necessary to take a corner at the same speed. If more mass is added to the rider, you are taking it from the bottom of the bike and placing it at a point that will be above every component of the bike for the majority of the race. The rider moves around a lot during a race, meaning that extra mass is going to have lots of little different effects, although I'm unsure of the specifics of this.  Also rider comfort has to be considered. Many riders are extremely specific about how their suits fit and feel, here's a video on VRs Dainese suit. Extra mass up by their head is probably not what riders are after, because as mentioned before, they move around a lot during a race. More mass = higher fatigue, which is asking a lot since the riders are performing at such a high level.  Lastly, Moto2 and Moto3 have bike+rider minimum weight limits, whereas MotoGP only includes the bike in the minimum weight. This means that moving mass from the bike to the rider in a GP scenario would possibly leave the bike underweight. Changes in rider weight do not matter in MotoGP AFAIK.  I do not disagree that rider safety should be of the utmost importance, but these are a few reasons why I don't believe the change you are suggesting could happen. The rate at which safety increases for GP riders is quite impressive, so I wouldn't be surprised to see improvements to the airbag system soon whilst maintaining the fit and feel the riders need."
motogp,3dsv0x,500GP,2,Sun Jul 19 06:58:23 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that they actually tried to run high center of gravities on MotoGP bikes so as to increase the weight transfer from rear to front under braking. Plus don't they have the actual location of the fuel quite a bit lower than where the 'fuel tank' is on the bikes? Or is that just to get the big air boxes up high?    In terms of the air bag systems I was thinking more along the lines of something for the torso, legs or arms."
motogp,3dsv0x,OmarsCommin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:05:39 2015 UTC,They do. That is why the 2007 Honda 'mass centralization' was such a failure

motogp,3dsv0x,KingLuis,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:01:51 2015 UTC,Why would a heavier suit mean better airbag system?
motogp,3dsv0x,bacinception,2,Sun Jul 19 14:03:51 2015 UTC,Currently any additional weight in a rider's suit would act as a penalty by adding to the overall mass of the rider plus bike. Thus there isn't much of an incentive to make more complex safety systems to add to the suits. If there wasn't a weight penalty however we might see some interesting tech get put into the suits.
motogp,3dsv0x,Magnavoxx,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:14:13 2015 UTC,"imo, as soon as rider weight starts impacting the overall allowable weight (like F1), they will ruin the sport.

This puts larger riders at a disadvantage. Would have contributed to Ben Spies having a tough time of it in MotoGP.    In moto2 & 3 they introduced a minimum rider + bike weight in the last few years where they didn't have this in place prior.

I think the other issue was that they didn't have the normal week off after this race and the teams were worried that they may be stuck in japan for 2 or 3 days before they could fly out, so they wanted move the race up so they could fly out immediately after race (ahead of the storm)."

motogp,3dmtdn,odrik,13,Fri Jul 17 15:27:34 2015 UTC,"At the moment, in terms of perceived loudness, MotoGP. In terms of actual peak dB, it seems that F1 is still louder at least according to the FIA who quote the cars as putting out 134dB compared with 145dB in the V8 era (which is a halving of loudness). The limit for MotoGP is 130dB as set out in the rules (pretty sure this hasn't been changed although it originally was 125dB).   It seems that the turbo V6 engines in the current F1 cars produce their sound at a lower frequency that the human ear isn't as sensitive too and as such sounds a lot more quiet even if the peak dB is right up there.

Lorenzo had a nice streak, but it's over and the doctor has been consistently faster. Even during Lorenzo's streak, it was the qualifying that put him so far ahead, not the actual race. Marquez has recovered, but math is math. If Marquez won every single race remaining (quite a feat in this championship), he would end up with 339 points. VR has been in the podium of EVERY single race this season. If he only repeated his performance so far (1,3,1,3,2,3,2,1,3), adjusted to MM winning every race, would be 2,3,2,3,2,3,2,2,3, and he would win the Championship with 343 points. Seeing as it would be very hard for MM to win every remaining race, I'd say his chances are nil. VR is in great shape, and everything seems to indicate he's not only been consistent so far, but improving (qualifying better).   Which rookie has been most impressive so far?  Viñales has been really strong, specially considering he performed better than Espargaró on the same bike(who is on his 4th MotoGP season).   Which have you been surprised by?  Honda's issues, and MM's incredible recovery (and quick too, I didn't think he would be able to recover until 2016). The lack of rain. Lorenzo's short-lived super-alien phase. Rossi getting a pole position again, an old dog can learn new tricks. Rossi's win in Argentina was incredible and totally unexpected, most interesting race I've ever seen. Pedrosa's performance at Sachsenring. That my motorcycle broke when I was going to Termas de Rio Hondo for Round 3 and I missed it, then the electricity went out minutes before Jerez started, and my PC died during the warm up lap in Sachsenring, fucking shit watching this season has been complicated.   What has not surprised you?  MM win in Sachsenring.   Are you as optimistic about Ducati as you were at the start of the season/ a third of the way in?  Yup. They went from being the escuderia that couldn't win with with Rossi, to the factory that can challenge the Aliens with great but not alien-level riders. They went from only-stoner-can-ride-it to this guys are consistently getting on or near the podium. They are gonna be better in 2016.   How do you survive the summer break?  Riding faster, faster, until the thrill of speed overcomes the lack of MotoGP. (Hopefully I'll fix my bike this month)."
motogp,3dg7ru,gnualmafuerte,6,Thu Jul 16 04:18:24 2015 UTC,"Even during Lorenzo's streak, it was the qualifying that put him so far ahead, not the actual race.   This is what makes me (cautiously optimistically) think that Rossi might do it. Even when Lorenzo bossed the races, Rossi showed more impressive pace trying to catch him.  Sachsenring showed that he has upped his FP/QP game and can get to the front immediately, on a circuit not suited to the Yamaha.  Now we're half way through the season, the advantages of the factory Honda and Yamaha teams are again making themselves clearer, so I think it's getting less and less likely that satellite bikes/Suzukis/Ducatis will qualify well, so that works in Rossi's favour top.   However...   Seeing as it would be very hard for MM to win every remaining race, I'd say his chances are nil.   The guy won 10 in a row last year. If he returns to that sort of form and Pedrosa/Lorenzo beat Rossi a few times, MM could easily win - and if goes down to the wire at Valencia I could easily imagine MM Capirossi-ing his way to the title."
motogp,3dg7ru,ross_rossifumi,3,Thu Jul 16 06:28:29 2015 UTC,"The guy won 10 in a row last year.   Exactly, last year! He had a once in a lifetime streak, during a perfect season, in which his bike was perfect, Rossi was still recovering from his 2 years at Ducati and his first year back on a Yamaha, Lorenzo wasn't Lorenzo, and he had almost no pressure whatsoever, given that yes he was the reigning champ, but winning the first 10 races is not like having to win the last 10 in order to win the championship. And we've seen what pressure does to the kid this season... I don't think he is out of the conversation yet, but I wouldn't compare last season to this one. Should he win this year, even without winning the last 10 races, it would be outstanding. But he won't. Hopefully due to n. 46..."

You gotta remember that the 2015 rc213-v chassis was not in top form at the beginning of this season hence the revert to the 2014 frame.

On most occasions that MM fell, so did the other Honda riders (like those on an RC-213: Cal, miller).   Only during the Argentina crash did the other Hondas perform pretty well, but he crashed because he bumped VR. Remembering France, 4 hondas crashed and MM finished 4th.   I'm rooting for VR46 all the way to the championship, but I absolutely blame the 2015 chassis on MM's hardships this year. When he reverted to last year's chassis, he's been his usual, alien self.  I'm really surprised Honda stuck with the new chassis as long as they did. But for Vale's sake, I'm glad!"

I will never bet against him for a Sunday battle, and I think he is improving in qualifying.   Which rookie has been most impressive so far?   Maverick Vinales   Which have you been surprised by?

Ducati fizzling out; the open bikes still in the back half of the grid   Are you as optimistic about Ducati as you were at the start of the season/ a third of the way in?

My perfect season would be to see both Hondas dominating 1st and 2nd so that when we get to the last few races Marquez is in contention for a 3 way battle. I doubt that will happen though, and it would really require Pedrosa to perform well to take points from Yamaha."
motogp,3dg7ru,Sultan_of_Slide,2,Thu Jul 16 05:56:41 2015 UTC,"Who do you think is going to win?   At the start of the season I thought Lorenzo will do it, then after his mediocre start to the season I thought Marquez is surely going to take the title. Well, then Lorenzo had his winning streak. Now the tables seem to have turned in Rossi's favour but maybe that also has to do with how the tyres for the last 2 tracks might have benefitted Rossi over Lorenzo. For the next races I think Lorenzo will have the upper hand and in general I think this will be his year.   Which rookie has been most impressive so far?   Vinales is the only correct answer here.   Which have you been surprised by?   Marquez crashes and the problems of the Honda. And also Rossi's performance so far. Didn't see him competing for the title. Ducati's start of the season was also refreshing to see.   What has not surprised you?   Suzuki's performance. I don't see them improving anymore this season.   Are you as optimistic about Ducati as you were at the start of the season/ a third of the way in?   No, probably not.

motogp,3dej5o,Big_douche,4,Wed Jul 15 20:52:28 2015 UTC,I'd say Hard Dick and Dovi are top level talent. Hard Dick had epic battles with Marquez in Moto2 and we've seen some reenactments a couple of times this year. Dovi is a consistent podium threat with competitive equipment.
motogp,3dej5o,Ih8Hondas,2,Wed Jul 15 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"Fuel has to be part of the reason; if you watch the last few laps of the Qatar race you'll see that Rossi would get much better drive on to the start/finish straight than Dovi, only to have Dovi blast past him before the finish line.   I haven't seen the Ducatis out drag another bike like that again this year. They were tuned right back from COTA onwards - and even at COTA not enough as both bikes had 'problems' apparently completely unrelated to fuel consumption on the cool-down lap...."
motogp,3dej5o,ross_rossifumi,0,Thu Jul 16 05:34:28 2015 UTC,The problem with Ducati isn't the motor's power. They currently out horsepower every single brand. Plus they have more engines to turn up the power without worrying about reliability.
motogp,3dej5o,Puppysmasher,2,Wed Jul 15 21:07:44 2015 UTC,"You are assuming the horsepower is a constant. The electronics control the hp from corner to corner and at different times of the race.

Barring a crash I don't think there will be a Duc on the podium again this year.  Weird stuff always seems to happen early on, then once Honda and Yamaha figure things out, order is restored. Maybe next year (assuming Ducati's development goes to plan) will be a bit better."
motogp,3dej5o,CXR1037,3,Thu Jul 16 02:21:33 2015 UTC,"Honda and Yamaha always improve their package over the season. It's part of the reason why satellite bikes will never win the championship -- the factory bikes get better, faster.   Ducati have a ton of work ahead of them. They started amazing and got some great results to boost morale and confidence, but at the end of the day, the bike isn't a magic bullet; they need to put in the laps and the development."
motogp,3dej5o,cantpee,2,Thu Jul 16 17:40:42 2015 UTC,"I would agree with all of these points. All the teams are usually much closer together the first few races of the season. Also, I'd like to point out that the top riders don't seem to be all that comfortable with the first 3 tracks of the season aside from Marquez at COTA. They aren't the long standing GPs like Jerez and Mugello, where most of the riders have a lot of experience and love for those tracks. Even in interviews, Rossi usually admits his goal is basically damage reduction in Argentina and Austin. That being said, I still give mad props to Ducati for developing a bike that had very little test time and has gotten huge results. Both Andreas are fantastic and Dovi is as solid as they come. I think it has been a string of bad luck for him more than anything."
motogp,3dej5o,deckinspector,2,Wed Jul 15 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"Well for two of the three dovi retirements, it's been down to mechanicals. There was the strange one in mugello and the crash at sachsenring was pretty much a one off. The guy hardly crashes   It may be the rules catching up with them, maybe these circuits are just not to the bikes liking. Both riders will get more podiums over the season  And FWIW, I'm sorry but I wouldn't have considered dovizioso a serious title challenger. The bike just has too much of a gap to bridge. Neither rider is really ready or capable to challenge. The odd pole or a win is definitely on the cards, but hopefully next year will bring a better change!"
motogp,3dej5o,Wicksy92,6,Wed Jul 15 17:37:14 2015 UTC,I feel so bad for Dovi lately. You know he puts in the work. He doesn't complain. He's a professional. And he seems like a likeable guy off the track. You just really want to see the guy be rewarded for it.
motogp,3dej5o,Ih8Hondas,2,Wed Jul 15 21:52:15 2015 UTC,"Yes I mean I don't really support riders in Moto GP per se but he is one I always keep an eye on. He's a fantastic defensive rider too, so good on the brakes. It's a shame as I don't think he is ever going have a serious chance in the premier class, but he has won a race and been world champion in the 125s. Provided Ducati do improve and with the 'year zero' in 2016, it won't be the biggest shock to me if he wins another"
motogp,3dej5o,Wicksy92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:34:23 2015 UTC,"Dani Pedrosa and Dovi's contracts expire at the end of the 2016 season.   I wouldn't be surprised if Honda dropped Pedrosa and pick up Dovi, that is, unless he Pedrosa could win a Championship but I doubt that's going to happen with Marquez around.  Anyway, Dovi would have a good chance if he were on a Honda."
motogp,3dej5o,pbae,2,Thu Jul 16 06:28:35 2015 UTC,"Dovi already had his chance at Factory Honda 2009-2011, and sort of burned his bridge there.  Honda wanted to bring in Stoner, and Dovi ""forced"" them to honor his contract and therefore put a third Repsol on the grid for him for a year.  He got 6th, 5th, and 3rd in those respective years."

motogp,3dej5o,dellking,4,Wed Jul 15 17:40:51 2015 UTC,"Lorenzo and Rossi have upped their games this season compared to last.  All things equal, they are better riders than Iannone and Dovi.

In Jerez Dovi had a mechanical issue in lap 1-2 and Iannone was lapping in rain mode. Mugello, Dovi DNF and Iannone with shoulder injury. Still got a podium. In LeMans the same. Iannone injury, Dovi podium.   Besides all this, there is surely a fuel cut effect, but looking where they came from they are doing very well."

Now that Dani is back and Marc has his bike in order it will be harder for Ducati to get noticed.  With so many healthy aliens its hard for an average rider like Dovi to make an impact.

Sete's team noticed something odd about the track at Rossi's starting grid and asked officials to investigate, the CCTV showed Rossi's team laying down rubber over night by doing burnouts to give him extra grip.  Rossi was made to start from the back of the grid.   I can't remember if there was any defence of the situation.

motogp,3dfkez,buhuhilus,2,Thu Jul 16 10:29:54 2015 UTC,"The easiest way? Eliminating the competition, Wacky Races style. Yes, it's far-fetched, but it could theoretically happen. You do need one competitive rider to begin with (that is, someone that can make podium consistenly, but not necessarily win races), then use a second (and possibly third from a satellite team) rider to take out the competition. A strategic crash here and there, and generally riding very defensively and trying to screw up other rider's lines.   Qualifying seems to be the easiest spot for this, fuck with the Aliens qualifying times, force them to start behind and get stuck in the pack, then have a rider there screw things further for them until you can get your top rider far away enough to guarantee a win.   2 or 3 troll riders should do the trick."

I think the user said there was actually a rule about how a rookie should work their way up from a satellite team before being able to ride for a factory team or sth. Can anyone confirm this?"
motogp,3dfkez,dustyshelves,2,Thu Jul 16 12:53:54 2015 UTC,"It's true, called the 'rookie rule'. Timing coincided with MMs entry in the GP class.

motogp,3dfkez,cantpee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:30:59 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I will attempt to answer some, I suppose it is an interesting discussion!  HOW: this could be an array of things. We've seen 'cheating' or rule bending in Motorsport for decades, where teams find loopholes to find the best advantage they can, such as the double diffuser in Brawn GP cars in 2009. It's not illegal, but stuff like that has probably happened and could happen in the future in Moto GP. The issue is that the breaking of rules would be addressed in rule changes or accepted into the sport  You could argue that preventing a certain rider from advancing out of group by deliberately cutting his lines and going defensive is 'fixing' a result for the benefit of another rider, but it is a stretch. It would always be seen as gamesmanship more than anything, but this has happened in the past. In 1990 loris capirossi and hans spaan were competing for the 125 championship at the finale in Philip Island. Loris managed to break and the other Italians were constantly cutting up spaan and slowing him down, which led to spaan attempting to punch fausto gresini (yes, that gresini) mid race on his bike  WHY: well, who knows? I suppose in a hypothetical situation, a satellite rider for Honda may do the same thing as mentioned above on the promise they get a repsol ride the year after, or preferential testing/wind tunnel treatment. Could just be pure money. Say if somehow jack miller leads going into the final corner at Indy with pedrosa right behind him. Money, a better ride or simply better support for LCR could lead miller to give up the position, but this could be construed as team orders, or in this hypothetical case manufacturers orders  In conclusion, it could possibly be done, but fixing is too strong a word. Not only that, but teams and riders can easily defend their actions through team orders, loopholes in the rules or excessively defensive riding"
motogp,3dfkez,Wicksy92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:50:54 2015 UTC,"What about fixing like ""Hey Jorge, MotoGP here. Heyyyyy Rossi reallllly needs his 10th crown this year, it'd be great for the ratings y'know? How about you dial it back a bit for the rest of the season eh? Cheer$ pal"""
motogp,3dfkez,NotNotLitotes,3,Wed Jul 15 23:51:21 2015 UTC,"Sure they could give it a try, but the beauty of bike racing is that once they're on track, it's all on the rider. Last year in WSBK I think there was a team orders situation with Guintoli? And he didn't pay attention.   I might not have met Lorenzo in person, but I know enough about him (and the majority of GP riders) that if it comes to a decision between a win and the money, the win takes it every single time."
motogp,3dfkez,Wicksy92,5,Thu Jul 16 09:48:50 2015 UTC,"It was loris baz and tom Sykes last year in world superbikes. Sykes was in competition with guintoli for the championship, with baz as sykes' teammate (and guintoli's fellow Frenchman)   IIRC Sykes had to make a couple of positions up in the last race to get the points to lead, and with baz ahead of him the Kawasaki team requested he give up his position. Baz refused, extended the gap over Sykes, and allowed guintoli to win the championship"

This could be a very good move for Aprilia - Bautista and Lowes would be a solid rider line-up.
motogp,3ddlfz,W50,15,Wed Jul 15 13:18:19 2015 UTC,I think it's just him riding the wheels off of an inferior chassis. Why not give him a shot? It'd be nice to see more guys break out in the top league.

Then someone gave him a great bike with a great setup(thanks to Sykes for bringing it as far as it has come) and now he is a grade above the rest of the men on the WSBK grid.   You always pick the man with heart and desire, they find ways to perform above and beyond what a bike can do.   And I am saying this as a man who dislikes Brit racers as a whole in MotoGP as they normally shit on everyone's expectations.   Edit: I am not saying Rae in WBSK translations to MotoGP as equals, but there is no harm in trying.

motogp,3ddlfz,Disgruntled__Goat,2,Fri Jul 17 12:21:38 2015 UTC,"He also has an offer from a top Moto2 team, according to BT Sport. I'm assuming that means MarcVDS or Pons. He could seriously challenge for the Moto2 title next year and get an even better offer in MotoGP in 2017.  Although on the other hand... there's always the chance this could be his only shot at MotoGP. You've got people like Rins who is likely to be challenging for the title next year, plus Danny Kent coming up. Plus Rabat and Zarco may be holding onto good satellite rides by then."
motogp,3ddlfz,Disgruntled__Goat,2,Wed Jul 15 15:32:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's Pons.  Pons primarily hires Spanish riders for his moto2 team.  Also, I suspect both Salom and Rins are going to be there for another season.  The MarcVDS is more intriguing.  I'm pretty sure AM will stay on the team next season, so the factor here is Rabat.

Because unless he improves drastically in the next few rounds I don't see his place being that safe.   the factor here is Rabat. Does he stay? Does he move up to MotoGP?   That probably depends on what options are available. If MarcVDS can run two bikes next year, or kick out Redding, then yes.  The other option of course is Zarco's team.

motogp,3ddlfz,NotNotLitotes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:27:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what his contract details are.  The reason I am thinking AM is staying is because this is only his first year in moto2 so I assumed that VDS would keep him another season, especially with Estrella Galacia as a sponsor.   The reason why I think Rabat is more interesting is because he already won the championship and despite not having as good a season this year, I'm not sure what more there is to prove for him in Moto2.  Of the two current MarcVDS riders, I think Rabat is the one more likely to move on.    Good point about Ajo Motorsport.  I hadn't thought of them."

Apart from Full Factory riders and those of the Satellite variety that get a near Factory ride complement of parts, it is really hard to say what the rest of the field will do. Look at Ducati at the start of the 800cc era. Honda have a lot more recent experience in the category. The Single ECU has a LOT of input from Honda. He will still have to learn the bigger bikes and really learn how to ride with all of the electronics. How many of the riders struggle with the MotoGP electronics in their first season? Just about every rider talks about the electronics as being their biggest hurdle.  Probably the best part of the deal for him would be the Gresini team taking him under their wing. If he can keep it upright they will nurture him.  This is all just my opinion.

motogp,3ddlfz,BritishBollocks,2,Wed Jul 15 18:09:37 2015 UTC,Just curious but why don't you see top level of talent in him? He absolutely dominated his championship season in world supersport. He then moved to the speed up team which is arguably a low class moto 2 team and has actually done something with it. He's taken a sub par bike and turned it into a contender. He has to push very hard to make a name for himself which will of course lead to crashes. He's got a shit load of talent imo. I would expect a serious championship fight from him if he was on a top tier team with your standard kalax frame instead of the one off speed up chassis.

motogp,3dea8n,Dan27,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:41:42 2015 UTC,Good analysis :)
motogp,3dea8n,Fight_Jeff,8,Sat Jul 18 12:29:04 2015 UTC,"As a general rule, the Yamahas are better at the fast, flowing circuits. They (Lorenzo especially) can carry more corner speed through the faster turns, almost like a giant 250 bike. This means they excel at circuits like Mugello, Brno, Philip Island and Catalunya.   The Hondas are stronger in hard braking, and hard acceleration, which means they tend to be stronger in the more stop start tracks. They have more power, and this lends itself to the 'point and squirt' style of riding. Marquez and Pedrosa are both masters of this- Marquez in particular will brake as late as he possibly can, square the corner off, and shoot out. The tracks they tend to excel at are Motegi (it's their main test track), Austin, and Sachsenring.   Sachsenring is a bit of a strange one, as it definitely isn't stop-start, and half the track is almost one continuous left hander. It is kind of a unique track, where all the bikes struggle for grip due to the amount left turns compared to right turns, and the Honda seems to have an edge when it comes to low grip conditions."
motogp,3dea8n,pondiki,2,Wed Jul 15 18:01:36 2015 UTC,"Honda also has won 5 of the last 7 (in a row) at Indianapolis; tracks with long straights work well for them as well, you can still see they have higher top speed than the Yamaha."
motogp,3dea8n,kuosenone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:22:18 2015 UTC,"Honda also tends to do well at tracks with elevation changes (COTA, Sachsenring, Brno) probably due to better power delivery compared to the yamaha (no fuel T-T). Hopefully this evens up next year when the factories get an additional 2 liters"
motogp,3dea8n,bitbangdub,3,Thu Jul 16 05:14:56 2015 UTC,Motegi is a Honda test track.  We can expect Marquez to push hard at Indy for 3 in a row there. Ducati have won at Misano before.

motogp,3daym7,bitbangdub,12,Tue Jul 14 21:34:02 2015 UTC,"Although I cannot really explain the sudden dominance / consistency of Kent on his return to the Moto3 class (learned something in Moto2 perhaps?), he and Vazquez have always been capable of running at or near the front depending on the weekend. Combine that with the experience of the Kiefer Racing Squad (who got the Moto2 championship with Bradl) and the lack of consitency from rivals and there you go.  Again though, Kent seems to have found something on the moto3 bike that no one can replicate. He can set a blistering pace with no toe. doesn't really mean money is involved (although Kiefer Racing has a bit of it if they are running a three man squad) as a large percentage of riding at that level is all between the ears."
motogp,3daym7,bjKnizek,5,Tue Jul 14 21:50:57 2015 UTC,yeah I think your point about the lack of consistency from the other riders is key too. There is great talent on the moto3 grid but Oliveira and Fenati have had bad luck and Bastianini and Quartararo lack experience. Thats given some of the older riders a chance to shine lately too like Masbou and Vasquez.   Its still a great grid but I just wish we had a battle for the title still at the summer break.  EDIT: I did also notice a maturity bump from Kent this season as compared to last. Maybe having the Jackass out of the Moto3 paddock and an extra year for is stubble to thicken has helped as well.
motogp,3daym7,Ged_UK,3,Tue Jul 14 22:04:49 2015 UTC,Colin Edwards attributed a lot of Kent's success to learning in Moto2 about bike setup. He can get the bike setup perfectly quicker than anyone else so that gives him longer to perfect his lap.
motogp,3daym7,CashCarStar,6,Wed Jul 15 04:53:58 2015 UTC,"It isn't really Leopard dominating though, is it? Kent is dominating, yes, but Vasquez isn't running any better than Oliveira, Bastianini, Quartararo, etc...so maybe it's just that Kent is the best racer on the grid right now?"
motogp,3daym7,CashCarStar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:58:38 2015 UTC,Vasquez is the grandad of Moto3 at the ripe old age of 28 so he's been consistent when he stays on the bike. Unfortunately he crashed out 3 times this year. Otherwise he might be 2nd in the championship now. He's still missed out on a win this year though (he had 2 last year) and I think thats due to his teammate being faster and his bad luck so far.
motogp,3daym7,mikeylawson,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:14:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not criticising Vasquez at all, but when he's stayed on the bike he hasn't been putting in the performances Kent has with running away from the rest of the pack. He's been with the rest of the group with the other riders I mentioned, plus others...so doesn't that mean that Leopard aren't really dominating as a team, and just that Kent is?"

motogp,3daym7,Puppysmasher,2,Wed Jul 15 16:25:48 2015 UTC,"Moto3 is fine in terms of entertainment value.    From a cost perspective, there is manufacturer competition (and thus increased costs - it costs more than moto2?!) and they are putting some coin in to develop the bikes.  I understand Honda really put some development into the bike in the off season.   The (BT?) sport announcers were speculating that Honda's focus on the moto3 bike has been part of the reason why their MotoGP bike has had some flaws.    Kent is at this point has been the best rider on (arguably) the best bike.  He has run away a few times.  I don't remember which other race he did, but for Germany, the track does not have a lot of straights, so there were not a lot of drafting dog fights."
motogp,3daym7,gustafh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:06:34 2015 UTC,It costs more than Moto2?can you elaborate on that point?
motogp,3daym7,Puppysmasher,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:51:08 2015 UTC,"Moto2 is far more of a spec series than Moto3 and run beefed up CBR engines and similar Kalex frames. The biggest difference being suspension brand choice.  Moto3 has different manufacturers which leads to higher costs. The bikes are really close still in terms if power but the premier teams there will have more crew and support from the factories along with the better riders. Also having different brands leads to factories charging more for the ""better"" Honda/KTM and more support."
motogp,3daym7,Caldtek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:49:55 2015 UTC,"While there are a lot of Kalexes this year, Suter, Speed Up and Tech3 are still in the running. Speed Up is currently fourth with Lowes. So there's more than just suspension that differs even though Kalex are dominating right now. Kind of like Aprilia back in the day..."
motogp,3daym7,Puppysmasher,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:17:07 2015 UTC,"Yes there are different chassis but in interviews they have said the chassis are still quite similar at the end of the day because they all use the same engine to design the chassis around.   It is also psychological with the chassis. If everyone is running Kalex, then a rider/team will feel pressure to run the Kalex because it is ""proven"". For example if Lowes was not doing well with SpeedUp then everyone will think SpeedUp is garbage because nobody is doing well. When in doubt people start thinking maybe its the package, maybe if I had that SpeedUp things will work better because look at Lowes, etc.   There was a recent clip on motogp.com going over suspension that covers this. Of course this also comes down to how much support you get for that suspension and chassis. Not everyone is on equal ""Kalex's"". Top teams still get the newest stuff and support. Lower tier teams may be running older versions, even crashed ones."
motogp,3daym7,Caldtek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:52:10 2015 UTC,I was on the understanding the in MOTO3 the manufacturers had to supply identical machines to all the teams. Any updates during the year must be made available to all the teams at a set cost..
motogp,3daym7,Puppysmasher,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:10:12 2015 UTC,That is just the engine itself.
motogp,3daym7,Caldtek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:52:36 2015 UTC,"Engines in MOTO3 are distributed to the teams by the race organizers, So there is no way you can ""pay"" honda/KTM for a better spec engine...  ""After a batch is confirmed to be the correct specification, the engines in that batch will be sealed and randomly allocated to the teams. No protests against engine specification will be accepted for such confirmed and sealed engines.""  Also the price of the engines is capped at 60K euro for 6 engines without gearboxes or throttle bodies. this is for all teams in MOTO3.."
motogp,3daym7,Puppysmasher,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:06:55 2015 UTC,"Its not just the engine. Its the overall support. There are ways around price caps with packages and charging extra for support and service. Moto2 is reportedly around 200,000 while Moto3 is 400,000. Remember price caps are just for the hard parts themselves and the basics, the pricing can get tricky with extra built in costs.   Remember last year when Livio Loi lost his Redbull KTM ride on the Ajo team? They were able to change the spec of the bike from Kalex KTM to full spec KTM at great cost in parts for just two races so he could prove himself. That is the support of a well funded and backed team.    “We took a standard KTM RC250R to Assen on Wednesday and worked through the night to upgrade it. We fitted the KTM Moto3 World Championship motor, the latest WP suspension and almost the entire KTM catalogue of factory parts. When the bike rolled out of the pit box for free practice on Thursday it was as close to factory spec as we could get it. I doubt even KTM could have spotted the differences without reducing the bike to its component parts and measuring everything.    There are definitely different ""packages"" on the grid. That is what happens when you have competing manufacturers. Not everyone is going to get top shelf parts and access to all that support. I guarantee teams like Leopard and Redbull KTM have the actual factory suspension technicians on call working in their box."
motogp,3daym7,Caldtek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"if there are they are breaking the sporting regulations... the chassis must be fully Homologated by the FIA before the season starts, performance parts: chassis, swingarm, seat, bodywork (except screen) fuel tank and suspension (but not internals) can be changed once a season and these modified parts must be made available to all the riders using that model of bike at the time. The teams are free to choose their own swing arm pivots, head races, triple clamps and suspension linkages. BTW this is all capped at 85K euro, and includes the cost of a single piece of any updated item in the season.... So any honda on the grid is identical to the one Danny Kent is riding, or can be if they choose to fit the parts......"
motogp,3daym7,Puppysmasher,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:10:40 2015 UTC,You are not fielding a Moto3 team on 85K euro and to say KTM Redbull factory racing is breaking the rules is absurd.
motogp,3daym7,Caldtek,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"Didn't say i could field a moto3 team on 85K, i said the full chassis package from any manufacturer is fixed at 85K, didn't say the KTM team were breaking the rules. Although, they would not be able to do what they did in 2014 this year. You stated there are ""different packages"" on the grid and ""not everyone gets the top shelf parts"", which if it is the case IS breaking the 2015 sporting regulations."
motogp,3daym7,W50,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:30:55 2015 UTC,"Look, you saw how KTM found a loophole and Dorna closed it. If you want to continue to believe there are no other loopholes (not all parts are homologated btw) then go ahead. This is racing, top teams will find ways to get an edge with the factories. It has already been proven in the past how getting clever with service and  ""packages"" can get around price caps. Just cause the chassis is fixed in cost doesn't mean there aren't other ways to bundle items and service and shift costs.  If this chassis loophole was never corrected and published you would be none the wiser and continue to think every team pays the same since all engines are the same. The public doesn't know the intricacies of the pricing and bundling of parts. Costs will be shifted and some teams are still going to get access to better kit and support in some shape or form. You want this homologated part at this price? Sure. Just buy this bundle with all this extra servicing for 300% mark up. No deal? Fine we will provide you with the bare bones to fulfill or regulation obligations with no support/technicians. Remember parts like suspension/brakes/wheels/exhaust are still open to upgrades.   You stated there are ""different packages"" on the grid and ""not everyone gets the top shelf parts"", which if it is the case IS breaking the 2015 sporting regulations.   And just like in 2014 no sporting regulations were broken in a supposed homologated class and yet there was a massive difference in cost and and difference in kit. This is known as a loophole and you can guarantee both sides of the paddock exploit every single loophole for the best package."
motogp,3daym7,Dan27,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:05:36 2015 UTC,"Sporting regulations are always published, I suggest you read the 2015 sporting regs and you will see how limited it is in 2015. All parts (even the non homologated ones) must be made available to all competitors at the same price. A new part cannot be used until there is sufficient supply from the manufacturer for it to be available for all teams. you can pay more for service if you wish but the parts are very strictly controlled. ECU btw is supplied free by the race organisers, there is a choice of wheels but only homologated ones can be used. Suspension must be the type homologated with the chassis. so if the chassis came with White power you have to stick with white power..."
motogp,3daym7,Wicksy92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:28:25 2015 UTC,"With the chassis rule change for 2015 its extremely unlikely that Leopard/Kiefer could have that sort of advantage over the other Honda bikes by simply spending more money (on what exactly?). Kent is usually .7 or .8 ahead of the EG Hondas and Bastianini's Gresini and that can't all be attributed to Leopard (granted, they are also dominating CEV with Joan Mir) and a good setup, Kent has stepped up to another level and is dominating a field full of talent, the Leopard/Kent combination is perfect."
motogp,3daym7,chemicalbudoka,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:36:39 2015 UTC,"I think a few posters here have already nailed it - Kent is dominating, rather than the team. He hit the ground running in the off-season both with the team and bike (he was going from ""Husqvarna"" KTM to Honda) and has learnt a number of lessons in the past with his trip to Moto2 being one. It's just the right combination right now.  He's also matured dramatically with regards to racecraft. He always seems to have the knack to be in the right place at the right time to at the very least secure a podium. Some of his late race strategy has been brilliant.  It's not often that we see such dominance in the 125cc/Moto3 class. Dare I say it that the last time was when Marquez was there?"
motogp,3daym7,udubmac,2,Wed Jul 15 08:11:14 2015 UTC,Nico terol's championship year in 2011 was dominant especially in the beginning. While zarco did give him a go and vinales won a couple it was clear terol was going to win

Moto isn't exactly the same. It seems as if there is less in the bikes than there is in the cars of F1. Having said that, when was the last time we didn't see 2 Yamahas, 2 Hondas and 2 Dukes at the front? Is that really because Rossi, Lorenzo, Marquez, Pedrosa, Iannone and Dovi are the 6 best riders?

Simply an observation.  I don't think i'm making sense again.  Basically, i think there's more riding ability in MotoGP/2/3 than there is engineering. The bikes are obviously different, but their performance isn't so much different that you're guaranteed a top spot simply for being on that bike and not crashing (like it is in F1). I made the obvious point that we always have the same 6 people at the front of MotoGP that all also happen to be riding in just three particular teams. It was just an observation and a potential argument against my point. Is that because those 6 riders really are the best and it's just coincidence, or is it because those three teams' bikes are dominating? Then i remembered that Bradley Smith has started doing a lot better recently, and his bike hasn't changed enough for him to have gained as many places as he did at the weekend compared to his previous races. So maybe i'm right, maybe it's the rider more than it is the bike and it really is just a coincidence."

But a bad driver can certainly lose a championship in a championship winning car.  Everything else is just opinion and speculation."

Honda developed the '15 bike in the wrong direction and it was only when they returned to the '14 chassis that he could be consistent again.  Remember, all these riders (and F1 drivers) are pretty much test pilots for their respective manufacturers R&D programs.  Doesn't matter how good of a rider you are, its mostly about the bike."

motogp,3db5zu,jpoma,2,Wed Jul 15 06:10:31 2015 UTC,"speedweek published a new article about the situation in german. iam gonna translate it as good as possible. iam still not a native english speaking person so have mercy and dont dumpster on me for possible mistakes.  speedweek article (german)   the team members are shocked after cuzari was arrested. no one knows what this means for the team at least for indy. the sponsors are also angry and its like high noon in the team office in switzerland. only cuzari has the bank mandate and its unknown when he will be out of jail. until now, its not sure that forward will be able to attend at the indy gp and even the races after indy including the season final in valencia is not assure. having dorna backing up the time between cuzaris release wont be a real possibility. stefan bradl said, that he called teammanager marco curioni and his crew-chief sergio verbana but both couldnt tell him anything what will happen. this doesnt only affect the motogp team. this also means that the moto2 team with simone corsi and lorenzo baldassarri wont be able to attend @ indy. ""we are worried"" was what the team members just said."

motogp,3d98i5,cantpee,7,Tue Jul 14 16:03:35 2015 UTC,"Lorenzo rarely ever does the same line as other riders. Usually he does a wider line and carries speed, which gives him higher corner exit speeds.

motogp,3dfchl,exg,18,Wed Jul 15 20:49:56 2015 UTC,"GOAT?  Rossi is undisputably the king of the 2000-2010 era, but he has only won two championships with adversity.   So putting this another way - you're saying that he might not be the greatest of all time because he was so much better than everyone else?"
motogp,3dfchl,elfuque,-5,Thu Jul 16 01:39:51 2015 UTC,"I believe he's still in the process of growing his legacy. The fact that the 2000 - 2010 era of MotoGP was so strongly non-competitive for Rossi exemplifies how he represented the next generation of riding style, much like how Agostini was racing on the next generation of machinery. It's like he was playing a different game. Now that he has legitimate competition that grew up idolizing and learning his style we will see how he fares in a class that actually suited to his skill. 2015 is shaping up to be a very important year for him."
motogp,3dfchl,elfuque,3,Thu Jul 16 02:25:19 2015 UTC,"How do you account for the fact that he's now 36 rather than 26 in this analysis.  Do we have to wait until rossi, stoner, lorenzo, pedrosa, and marquez have all reached age 40 (or whatever) to make a judgment?"
motogp,3dfchl,montyzac,-2,Thu Jul 16 02:32:20 2015 UTC,"The ""new"" style of more aggressive dirt training that Rossi practices is going a long way towards increasing rider fitness and longevity. At this point I consider him to be as dangerous as ever, especially due to 15 seasons of MotoGP experience, so I don't handicap him for his age."
motogp,3dfchl,gnualmafuerte,2,Thu Jul 16 03:05:10 2015 UTC,"It's a near impossible thing you are looking at here.   In your analysis, why have you ignored the 2007 season?   Pretty much the same riders as 2008 when you say he had no competition but he only finished 3rd in 2007 vs a massive points advantage in 2008.   Also. Sete in 2004 wasn't the factory team. That was Alex Barros and Hayden that year. Sete was in the Gresini team."
motogp,3dfchl,james-watson,14,Thu Jul 16 17:35:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is the most unfair comparison I've ever seen. Your method is completely skewed. You mentioned Agostini wasn't playing a fair game because he had a mechanical advantage, and you wanted to figure out if Rossi has been in the same situation ... so you proceed to completely ignore Rossi's machines and make a comparison based on points alone? What tells you those points were won by an unfair mechanical advantage or lack of competition?  You didn't even go there because the mechanical advantage point goes right out the window the second you realize people have been telling Rossi that shit his entire career. That's why he left Honda and went to Yamaha, people were saying he only won because of the Honda. So he moved to what was at the time a less powerful machine. And proceeded to win. So, bullshit, if anything, VR has raced in UNDER powered machines, and still won (Ducati aside).   And, regarding competition? Come on. You are implying that MotoGP didn't have any competitive riders besides him for 10 years? Ridiculous.   In any case, VR was always bad at qualifying, and that put him always at a disadvantage. He was negatively affected by the qualify rule changes, and therefore has raced from behind the second line for many years, and still manages to win races and win podiums.   In any case, the OPPOSITE is true. We're arguing about him being the GOAT, when he as raced with a serious handicap for most of his career: Frequent factory changes, bad qualifying, and now being WAY older than most riders. If he had ignored the complains and stayed in Honda, he would have probably closer to 15 championships under his belt.   We literally see this guy that's a decade older than most guys on the track start behind the pack, then fight his way to the podium. If that's not GOAT material, I don't know what is."
motogp,3dfchl,Myrelin,-6,Thu Jul 16 05:02:47 2015 UTC,"I wanted to find out more about Rossi's dominance in light of Agostini's records being explained by a game-changing advantage. Agostini's advantage was mechanical, and Rossi's is riding style. They each changed the game in a way that fundamentally rendered the rest of the field non-competitive.   Let me be clear that I don't think Rossi generally had a mechanical advantage outside of being on a Factory ride.   You are implying that MotoGP didn't have any competitive riders besides him for 10 years?    Great riders, yes. Competitive championship, no. The records show that the MotoGP championship was non-competitive for almost 10 years under Rossi's reign. He dominated it completely in a way that showed how far ahead of the curve he was in that era. The points totals exemplify this. Riders had yet to catch up to his way of racing.   he as raced with a serious handicap for most of his career: Frequent factory changes, bad qualifying, and now being WAY older than most riders.    He's been on Factory hardware his entire career, so that can't be taken as a serious handicap when the only way to win a championship is on a Factory bike. That's just the nature of the game. The ageist argument has lost meaning in recent years, and I would expect healthy riders to be competitive later in life due to the new dirt training regimens that Rossi and Marquez are championing. Qualifying is definitely an issue for him, but he has mostly overcome it through aggressive and immediate overtaking.   He may very well turn out to be the GOAT, he's still writing his recordbook that'll be judged on a scale of future Rossi's. Whatever the case I think that has finally entered an era where he's faced any sort of meaningful adversity from competitors. To see him still fighting for the podium is testament to his abilities."
motogp,3dfchl,theshedend1994,2,Thu Jul 16 06:23:09 2015 UTC,"You are way too caught up counting the acorns, and thus miss the trees and the forest.  Rossi won his first two 4-stroke titles on a Honda. The Honda was so dominant that critics accused him of having a huge machine advantage. He then switched to the Yamaha, a bike that hadn't won a championship in over a decade (1993 at the hands of Wayne Rainey).  He won his first race on the new Yamaha, and won the championship in 2004, his first year on an unproven bike.   He went on to win the majority of his 7 world class titles on the Yamaha, beating all of his teammates along the way (Edwards, Spies, Lorenzo).   So my friend, instead of having fun with numbers, lets simplify things and look at the basic facts instead. If a bike suits Rossi (Honda, Yamaha) he can beat the best in the world.   This doesn't mean he's had a technical advantage, as his rivals have been on the exacts same spec of bike as him.  Do you know who took over Rossi's Repsol Honda in 2004?  Max Biaggi. Guess who won the championship?  P.S. Regarding the Ducati years, Rossi admitted it was done to spite Yamaha because of their insistence on treating the rookie Lorenzo equal to Rossi. This revealed a weakness in Rossi's character, in that he'd become too egotistical with his position as the #1 Yamaha man. He later admitted that it was the very same Yamaha equal-treatment policy that saved him when he returned to the team. He is now much more humble and understanding of what it means to be a newcomer to a team."
motogp,3dfchl,wymaen,0,Thu Jul 16 22:47:03 2015 UTC,Counting acorns is what MotoGP does; points are the defining measure of a season in the record books. I'm deliberately looking at the Championship through this lens so we can look critically at how competitive it is based upon its rules.
motogp,3dfchl,FullBlownErectionBBQ,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:57:02 2015 UTC,"Agostini's advantage was mechanical, and Rossi's is riding style.    What you're actually showing here is that Rossi is the undisputed GOAT. The usual argument against a rider being the greatest is mechanical advantage, machinery being head and shoulders above the rest. In Agostini's case that was true - in Rossi's case, as you said yourself he himself was the ""unfair advantage"".   Which is exactly what makes a rider the GOAT. He wasn't up against other ""competitive riders"", because they paled in comparison to what he did on his bike.  And this still doesn't take into consideration how long he's been competitive for - consistent for two decades - and still fighting for the championship. And he has won titles with what, 3 different engine displacements? 4 different bikes?"
motogp,3dfchl,Puppysmasher,3,Thu Jul 16 17:05:57 2015 UTC,"Personally dont think its fair to say that Rossi is in the same boat in that he has dominated through overpowered machinery. Firstly, hes literally always had the same spec machinery as his competitors, unlike Agostini who as you say was on a 3 cylinder bike against guys with one, would harbour a guess at riders these days being much more aggressive and racey than back in the day, taking nothing away from the guys in the 50's who must have had balls of steel to do what they did with the safety standards of the day.  Thing that has struck me most about Rossi is how he has been able to overcome most, if not all of, his rival protaganists over the last 15 years. He's had beef with both Biaggi and Gibernau in the early 00's and seen to them, even predicting the latters last race win. Narrowly lost the title to Hayden who soon faded into midscurioty. Stoner I would say is like Marquez, able to beat Rossi consistently on superior machinery, but not quite able to get the better of him in a one on one straight duel - Stoner Laguna Seca 08, Marquez Assen 15.   That would leave Lorenzo, whos come into the team somewhat as Rossi's apprentice yet rival, and managed to turn the tide in his favour, clearly Mugello 2010 was a contributing factor to that. Rossi's years at Ducati to me somewhat matured him and I think he appreciated more what he had at Yamaha. now we're seeing Rossi once again getting the better of a rider who debatebly is one of the top 10/15 riders who ever raced and look to set up what could be one the closest title battles for years.   Personally, I already think Valentino is the GOAT, but seeing off thr challenge of Marquez and Lorenzo in their primes, at the age of 33, could be his most impressive feat yet."
motogp,3dfchl,Puppysmasher,5,Wed Jul 15 21:19:37 2015 UTC,He's 36.  Don't you listen to Nick Harris?  :)
motogp,3dfchl,Puppysmasher,2,Wed Jul 15 21:42:45 2015 UTC,Rossi is 36 years old.
motogp,3dfchl,KICKERMAN360,-1,Wed Jul 15 23:05:42 2015 UTC,"I meant that Rossi himself is overpowered machinery.   Honda and Yamaha now seem to be very, very close in terms of performance. The remaining manufacturers still have a long way to go to compete at the front, though, so there's a bit of a gap in terms of what we know about how other riders would perform on similar hardware."
motogp,3dfchl,surfmeh,2,Wed Jul 15 21:32:59 2015 UTC,The point gap in racing is also because a crash usually leads to 0 points while a win nets you 25. So you can have two title contenders but a crash will drop one off the grid by a huge margin.
motogp,3dfchl,surfmeh,-2,Wed Jul 15 21:10:58 2015 UTC,"I think that's one of the pitfalls of the current point system, and it's disappointing to watch as a fan. It could easily happen to anyone, though, which presumably serves to balance it out over the season. I'm sure they've thought of points per position per lap - I wonder how that would work out in MotoGP."
motogp,3dfchl,ross_rossifumi,3,Wed Jul 15 21:28:40 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, not crashing is part of the game and skill given how much on the limit they are on. Still late in the season racing for points instead of wins can get a bit boring."
motogp,3dfchl,ross_rossifumi,0,Wed Jul 15 22:02:42 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a full spectrum judge of the whole team's ability, mechanics, riders, team boss, etc. If the data was out there I could do some calculations on how seasons would play out if we awarded per lap points in some fashion, with a worthwhile bonus for getting on the podium.  I had a conversation with someone once about Crutchlow, about how he's an excellent rider and deserves more credit. Their response was essentially that it doesn't matter if you're good if you don't finish (Crashlow, etc). At the end of the day that's basically the name of the game, but it's way easier to say it about a team that you're not a fan of!"
motogp,3dfchl,Sultan_of_Slide,3,Wed Jul 15 22:11:21 2015 UTC,"It sort of harkens to the old saying, going fast is easy, its not crashing that is the tricky part, or something like that.   You sort of see this within the paddock too. Its easier to teach a fast rider to stop crashing than it is to make a slow rider go faster. Sort of why even riders that crash, if they display the raw speed, they will get noticed by teams for further development. (Iannone, Aleix, Lowes, even Jorge was a crasher as a rookie)"
motogp,3dfchl,ross_rossifumi,2,Wed Jul 15 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"Ago raced in a completely different error, where there wasn't a fine line between fast and fastest. So it was easier to go faster. Plus, it was like Ago racing on a factory Honda and everyone else on an Open Class machinery. It wasn't a fair fight most of the time. Rossi on the other hand dominated on many different types of machines against competitive bikes. The numbers don't tell the full story. Go listen to Edwards try and describe why he is so good and he doesn't have an answer. It's like comparing Fangio to Senna or Schumacher. It's just completely different eras but analyse it properly and Fangio isn't the best."
motogp,3dfchl,otacon-,2,Thu Jul 16 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"You are saying because he was consistently better than his opposition, you rate him worse?   When he has seasons where he consistently wins you could say it is simply because his bike is better. However you would have to compare bikes and see how their teammates stack up and riders on the other front running bikes (I know not all years have more than 1 front running team). Honestly for a large chunk of these seasons it looks like Rossi was the one that made the difference when compared to his teammates.  Saying that his skill is so much better than everyone else essentially confirms that he is the best. The assumption being that if there was some one of quality enough to bring a challenge to Rossi they would have been picked up by a factory team that would be competitive. Thus they would have more close seasons. This means that there have been flashes of brilliance put together by some riders but none were able to sustain a proper threat to his dominance.  Honestly I think that MM is really good and has a great aggressive style but he seems to struggle when he does not have some kind of edge. Stoner seemed similar. Lorenzo seemed to push him the hardest, especially since we could compare them on the same machinery."
motogp,3dfchl,FullBlownErectionBBQ,-1,Thu Jul 16 03:10:10 2015 UTC,"I rated him as outclassing the previous generation of riders so dramatically that he rendered the MotoGP championship non-competitive for almost a full decade. Now that he has legitimate competition in the field that grew up knowing that what he does is even possible, he is finally in a class that is suited to his skill level."
motogp,3dfchl,otacon-,3,Thu Jul 16 03:22:24 2015 UTC,Essentially he is the standard/bar of the best there has ever been. Therefore GOAT status.
motogp,3dfchl,longwalkshortidea,0,Thu Jul 16 03:41:29 2015 UTC,"The way I think of it is like this:  2000-2010:  Rossi walks into a bar to find that everyone is fighting with knives. He has an AK-47.  2011 - 2014:  Everyone in the bar has now figured out that they need to use AK-47s too.  2015:  Rossi might have found a cruise missile in the back of the bar.    I'm far more interested to see what happens now that Rossi is competing in a class that has elevated to his skill level than when he was racing against riders that were essentially stuck in a previous generation. In this sense he's largely untested in a legitimate title search outside of just 2 previous seasons. Again, it looks like Lorenzo might be the one to do it."

Smith will most likely resign with tech3 for another year, but if he does leave I'd love to see them grab Rins up from moto2. Pol is having a bad season in what just happens to be the worst time for it in this era of MotoGP; too many young talented riders and not enough seats to fill them...I could see Pol moving down to open type bike next year, or maybe KTM or Aprilia if they are feeling ballsy. And I still think if Dovi's performance continues on like it has been we will see a new face at Ducati in 2017"
motogp,3d9tyq,xuryfluous,3,Wed Jul 15 04:03:36 2015 UTC,Why would Crutchlow be back at Tech3? Sponsors? He seems to be getting along ok with the Honda.
motogp,3d9tyq,cantpee,0,Wed Jul 15 05:48:23 2015 UTC,"Supposedly he's been sniffing around. Maybe after trying the 3 top bikes he's decided he likes the Yam best, and wants a shot at the factory seat in 2017.  Sponsors are probably a part of it. Monster is a big personal sponsor of his, but Honda has big ties with Red Bull."
motogp,3d9tyq,Disgruntled__Goat,2,Wed Jul 15 12:42:42 2015 UTC,"To be fair all riders sniff around during silly season, it helps their negotiating for next year. I think Crutchlow will stick with Honda. The grid is a lot stiffer now and that LCR is a solid ride. Plus Herve has said in the past his team is about younger up and coming talent when signing riders."
motogp,3d9tyq,Puppysmasher,3,Wed Jul 15 16:30:55 2015 UTC,"Dovi is an interesting situation.   Look in detail at his results, the moment iannone got pole everything has gone to shit for him. Prior to that he was only off the podium once in 5 races then 3 DNF and a 12th."

motogp,3d9tyq,montyzac,8,Wed Jul 15 15:54:24 2015 UTC,"Redding is not getting the boot.   They expanded the team for the MotoGP class for him, and got the extra sponsorship for him to compete on the Honda. If anyone is getting the boot from that setup, it's likely to be Chris Pike - his crewchief - who is new to MotoGP from Superbikes. They need to convince Pete Benson to move from the Moto2 squad to work with Honda again.  Redding's performances have also been affected by the tyre rules favouring Ducati and Suzuki this season."
motogp,3d9tyq,Dan27,2,Tue Jul 14 18:07:33 2015 UTC,Also the bike was bad for most of the season. Hondas were crashing left and right and until HRC put in massive effort behind MM so was MM. I doubt Redding is getting that kind of support to fix the problems.   Hondas in general suck this season so far. Everyone was crashing and the Open Hondas are a complete joke languishing outside of the points.
motogp,3d9tyq,Puppysmasher,8,Wed Jul 15 16:38:10 2015 UTC,"How is it pretty obvious?   Marc vanderstraton likes Redding,  and believe in him so I think his seat is safe. Bradl will probably head to KTM which leaves a seat open at Forward."

Bradl is like a Dani Pedrosa to me: quiet and fast, but Bradl crashes way more and gets hurt way less."
motogp,3d9tyq,Marshall498,2,Tue Jul 14 17:55:19 2015 UTC,Bradl is german...he is the only german in the top class.  Pedrosa is another spanish rider   Dorna will back bradl at ktm over pedrosa. Although the mere thought of pedrosa running the ktm is tasty
motogp,3d9tyq,OnTheTerlet,2,Tue Jul 14 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, why would Dorna have to back someone getting the seat? If it was offered to Pedrosa couldn't he just take it?"
motogp,3d9tyq,cantpee,2,Wed Jul 15 04:27:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Dorna has to think about marketing in various countries. I don't know if it will come as a suggestion or as a suitcase of money, but I'm sure they will give their input."
motogp,3d9tyq,montyzac,2,Wed Jul 15 15:46:32 2015 UTC,"Well he has 30 points and he's the last of the non-open bikes in the championship. I say it's ""obvious"" because he's on an expensive machine making expensive crashes and he's not getting any results - even VDS money isn't infinite. Friends or not, it seems silly to try and string him along when he's not making forward progess."
motogp,3d9tyq,Puppysmasher,5,Tue Jul 14 17:11:41 2015 UTC,How do you know where the issue sits though?   The team are new to the bike. They may well see the problems are with them as much.   Having the team know exactly what they are doing is just as important. Look how Cal improved when he had Dannis engineers.
motogp,3d9tyq,Disgruntled__Goat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:51:49 2015 UTC,"Very true, but in the end it's Redding at the controls. As someone else said in this thread, if redding doesn't leave it might his crew chief. Something at that team has to give to get the results that bike is capable of."
motogp,3d9tyq,Puppysmasher,2,Tue Jul 14 21:25:08 2015 UTC,Redding's crew chief is pretty expendable. The guy is a new to GP and has zero experience as well. We don't know the inner workings of that box but I say his crew chief is more at risk of being let go than Redding.   Plus there is also the issue of the Honda having massive problems this first half of the season. That would only exaggerate Redding's struggles. Literally none of the Hondas on the grid are doing well except the Respols and that was just these last two races. Remember MM crashing out how many times this season?
motogp,3d9tyq,W50,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:36:07 2015 UTC,"Look at the times from practice, Redding was right up there. Unfortunately he missed out on Q2 because of the guys on the soft tyres, and then he crashed in the race so we didn't get to see where he might have ended up.  At least it sounds like they made some progress with the bike so we'll have to see how Indy/Brno go."
motogp,3d9tyq,Wicksy92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:32:07 2015 UTC,Redding will get another year. Usually teams don't dump riders after just one bad half season when they have shown potential in the past. Its not like Redding didn't perform in Moto2 or his rookie year.
motogp,3d9tyq,James_W_Bottomtooth,3,Wed Jul 15 16:34:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if he'll be replaced even though there are some rumours suggesting he could be on the way out. If he is to leave then Rabat would be the leading candidate and if he isn't, then surely that would mean an end for the Rabat/MarcVDS. Nothing concrete at the moment but it is possible MarcVDS could run two bikes next year."
motogp,3d9tyq,James_W_Bottomtooth,2,Tue Jul 14 19:20:57 2015 UTC,"If redding even leaves I'd say either zarco or Rabat. I imagine zarco may go elsewhere but Rabat does have the Marc VDS link too. I imagine they will be the hot commodities going into next year, I doubt any other rookies will get a better bike than them"

motogp,3d9tyq,Puppysmasher,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:19:27 2015 UTC,"No, they said he has an offer from Aprilia, plus an offer from a top team in Moto2 (MarcVDS or Pons I assume). Personally I'd prefer he stayed in Moto2 for a shot at the title, but in the commentary they reckoned he was more likely to take the MotoGP factory ride, even if it is Aprilia."
motogp,3d9tyq,udubmac,2,Tue Jul 14 22:22:32 2015 UTC,"My knee jerk reaction is that Rins is a prime target for that bike. He's been killing it in moto2 for his rookie year, seems to be a calculated rider and has some backing. Plus wouldn't VDS like to take away one of pon's quick riders?  Other rider I'm keeping my eye on is Zarco, kid's got chutzpah."
motogp,3d9tyq,Disgruntled__Goat,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:40:06 2015 UTC,I'd torn on Rins. Almost rather him stay back one year and try to win Moto2.... if Tito will ever leave.
motogp,3d9tyq,beavz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:04:44 2015 UTC,I think Tito will try to jump ship to GP. This year has show success in Moto2 is fleeting and you are soon forgotten for consideration. I think he is going to try for a ride in GP while his title is still warm.
motogp,3d9tyq,cantpee,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:39:52 2015 UTC,I wonder if MarcVDS will pick up a second bike to bring him up and join Scott Redding. That was rumor at the beginning of the year.

motogp,3d571y,RC211V,2,Tue Jul 14 07:24:45 2015 UTC,Short answer   Y
motogp,3d571y,novesori,71,Tue Jul 14 13:43:14 2015 UTC,"Giacomo Agostini was racing in both 350cc and 500cc throughout his entire career, essentially doubling his number of wins. That's not to take anything away from him, he's an amazing rider and was incredibly dominant during his time, but I imagine if Rossi was still racing in Moto3/Moto2 or even just another circuit like WSBK, he would easily have double the number of wins, if not more.  Agostini's dominance was from 1965 - 1975, a ten year span in two classes, totalling 15 titles.  Rossi has been dominating since 1997 and will probably continue to put up good results for a couple more years. If Rossi can put up top 3 finishes for the next 2 seasons, he'll have been dominant for 20 years, double the time of Agostini, and made 9 titles (10 if he takes it this year).  Rossi has been the most consistent for the longest period of time, finishing top 3 on anything that isn't a Ducati (IIRC) and contesting the podium for almost 20 years.  I think he's already proven he's the GOAT."
motogp,3d571y,minasmorath,5,Mon Jul 13 17:15:13 2015 UTC,"Agostini also had a massive mechanical advantage compared to his competitors. Barely any factory kit on the grid, he  had like the only competitive bike on the grid for many years, a 3 cylinder bike versus 1 cylinder thumpers. Also the championship was only about half as long compared to modern times.   Rossi is the GOAT no question."

motogp,3d571y,TonyCB4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:37:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I kind of mangled that sentence, what I meant to say is that Rossi finished the season in 6th or 7th place during his time with Ducati, but he was still a podium contender for each race even if he wasn't in the running for the championship."
motogp,3d571y,minasmorath,-2,Tue Jul 14 11:31:32 2015 UTC,"lol a podium contender each race when there were 2 factory yamahas, 2 satalite yamahas and 3 or so factory Hondas plus their satalite bikes? Hahahahah"
motogp,3d571y,Karl_Vos,0,Tue Jul 14 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"The Ducati was sub par compared to the rest of the field, yes, but Rossi was riding it to the limit at all times, making him a constant threat for placements even if he wasn't in contention for the title."
motogp,3d571y,minasmorath,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:27:54 2015 UTC,The more I read your statement the more stupid it sounds. Rossi came 7th in the championship in 2011 behind 6 Hondas and Yamaha's and he our scored his teammate by 7 points. And this is Rossi the GOAT.... In 2012 he did much better after they continued with a twin spar frame that he demanded they make but he still finished behind two satellite bikes.
motogp,3d571y,Karl_Vos,-1,Wed Jul 15 01:51:36 2015 UTC,What planet are you on?  Qatar - Rossi 16 secs from victory Portugal - Rossi 16 secs from victory Britian - Rossi 1 minute from victory and behind Hayden Germany - Rossi 27 secs from victory and behind Hayden.  Stoner was winning on the same bike mere months before Rossi rode it.
motogp,3d571y,Karl_Vos,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:47:52 2015 UTC,Such a personality. He will defiinitely go down as the goat.
motogp,3d571y,tabovilla,22,Tue Jul 14 03:58:11 2015 UTC,"yes, because it will mean he will have beaten every rider in the midst of his career.  He's beaten Biaggi, Gibernau, Lorenzo, Stoner, Hayden, Pedrosa.    The last on the list is Marquez.  Also, arguably, beating his now stronger teammate in Lorenzo (Lorenzo has won 2 since Rossi's last) would be an accomplishment.  He won't need to beat Ago's record since Ago's record came at a time when rider's running multiple classes was the norm.  Rossi has never run multiple classes simultaneously."
motogp,3d571y,jpoma,4,Mon Jul 13 17:07:50 2015 UTC,When is the last time someone was allowed to run in multiple classes? Or is it still allowed and no one does it? I thought I remember Marquez saying something about it last year.

motogp,3d571y,DonSirref,-1,Tue Jul 14 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by 'beaten'?  Hayden has beaten Rossi in 2006, so I wonder what criteria you're using."

motogp,3d571y,mrsirawesome,0,Tue Jul 14 11:56:21 2015 UTC,"OK fine, but it's also a true statement that Hayden had beaten Rossi fair and square.  It's just a murky definition/criteria is my point."
motogp,3d571y,motorboatnowork,5,Tue Jul 14 11:58:21 2015 UTC,"I'd dispute that too, to be honest. Hayden won two races to Rossi's five in 2006. Rossi had mechanical retirements in China, France, and USA. It's a team sport, and Hayden won the championship. But you can't point at 2006 and say Hayden was the better rider."
motogp,3d571y,jamestrainwreck,-2,Wed Jul 15 03:00:30 2015 UTC,"The points system was put into place to decide the better rider.  If you just say ""oh rider A might have won, but we know rider B is just better"" then you're getting into a whole lot of subjectivity, at which point you might as well toss the points system, because there will always be the ""best"" rider in people's opinion, won't there.  On how many occasions will a Lorenzo or Rossi say ""____ was just faster today"".  So without a comment like that, would we still consider Rossi to be the better rider on the day even if he didn't?  Would we apply that thinking to a whole season?  Or would saying ""____ was just faster this season"" apply just as equally."
motogp,3d571y,motorboatnowork,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:08:18 2015 UTC,Why don't we assign Rossi the points from the position he was in when he had to end the race due to mechanicals? We can even give Hayden his points back from dani taking him out. Who would come out on top?
motogp,3d571y,GingerB237,2,Wed Jul 15 17:54:20 2015 UTC,"You make a totally fair point, Rossi has lost several battles over the  years.  The war, however..."
motogp,3d571y,mrsirawesome,14,Wed Jul 15 14:18:48 2015 UTC,"He is already the GOAT. Marc is probably ""the next one"" and we'll have to see how far he goes in his career. He's a good kid, but will never have the same likeability that Rossi has.     There is more to Rossi than podiums and titles. It's his personality, charisma, charm, and cult following. He is so important to MotoGP, and capping off this season with a championship would be nothing short of magical. I will cry, I guarantee it. He will cry, we will probably all cry....because deep down, no matter who your favorite rider is, everyone wants Rossi to take #10 this year. Everyone."
motogp,3d571y,jcav8r,4,Tue Jul 14 00:19:01 2015 UTC,"I think MM is a pretty likeable figure overall, even if he's not as exciting as Rossi. Really, who could hate that baby face?"

motogp,3d571y,Opti86,8,Mon Jul 13 17:11:45 2015 UTC,"If he wins the title this year it would have to go down as one of the greatest comebacks in the history of sport. I think you'd have to go back to Ali Fraser in '74 to find a comparison. Add that to the rest of his achievements and, yea, he's the undisputed GOAT."
motogp,3d571y,biskino,8,Mon Jul 13 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"He already is, even Ago himself will tell you that."
motogp,3d571y,Kevydee,8,Mon Jul 13 19:38:01 2015 UTC,Collin Edwards already called him the GOAT. that's all I need.
motogp,3d571y,Ron_1n,6,Mon Jul 13 21:13:18 2015 UTC,F1 has Schumacher.  WRC has Loeb  WEC has Kristensen  And MotoGP has Rossi.
motogp,3d571y,Vinura,3,Tue Jul 14 12:39:51 2015 UTC,"Simply put: Rossi already is the GOAT (for the many reasons others already mentioned), but if you look at his age and performance, MM has a serious shot at his throne (personally I don't love MM, but he's the closest to Rossi since...well, Rossi himself).   This is why this season is so crucial in terms of legacy: if Rossi wins, he will have beaten a very similar version of himself aged 22, all this at 36. This would be absolutely insane, and to me it would take MM out of the conversation, no matter what he wins later in his career (paradoxically, the more he wins in the future, the greater the value of Valentino's feat). Considering the age difference, and the talent of the two, it is normal for a Marquez at his peak (or close to his peak) to beat an old Valentino, without this making him necessarily better in a hypothetical GOAT conversation. On the other hand, it isn't normal for Valentino to still be so fast and competitive to beat riders such as Marquez (and Lorenzo). It would have been like seeing Doohan beat Valentino in the early 2000s: now just think of how that would have changed the perception of both riders.  So the answer is yes, the 10th championship will make him the undisputed GOAT, preventing any rider who competed directly against him to possibly dethrone him."
motogp,3d571y,johncavenaghi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:18:07 2015 UTC,"Out of interest, just chuck this into the mix: (not related to Rossi being the GOAT).  What if Honda have fixed the problems with the RCV and Marc goes on to finish the rest of the season with more race wins, but because of the bike issues in this half doesn't win but Rossi does.  Would you still think less of Marc then?   You do have to take into consideration the bike they are on, like the years Yamaha gave Rossi a pup. 2006/2007 spring to mind."
motogp,3d571y,montyzac,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:53:53 2015 UTC,"Assuming Marquez were to win all the upcoming GPs you could still argue for the opposite.   Rossi, being the calculating and experienced campaigner he is, will let Marquez win the upcoming races as long as Rossi can finish ahead of Lorenzo. Marquez's championship hopes are dead; the only thing that could revive them would be Rossi falling off. The most likely way of that happening is going toe to toe with Marquez for individual race wins.  In effect Rossi has beaten Marquez, and I do agree that's because Honda seem to have given him a manky frame. If GOAT is measure by championship wins, anyone worthy of the GOAT title wouldn't consider trying to race Marquez at this point."
motogp,3d571y,not_shakey_byrne,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:11:45 2015 UTC,"That assumes he can finish ahead of Lorenzo of course. 13 points isn't a comfortable gap so he needs bikes between him and Lorenzo if many other races like Sundays. And, where has everyone else gone to?  Hard to know what's going to pan out, I cant help but think that last race may have just been an oddity because those Hondas could run the hard front and historically both Marc and Danni are good there.

motogp,3d571y,montyzac,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:37:37 2015 UTC,"I think the interesting thing is going to be how each handles 93.  If 46 is upfront and 99 is behind with 93 behind him, might he be tempted to let 93 passed to ruffle some feathers ? They'd slow each other up - even if they don't take each other out.  He lets them scrap it out and baby his tires, come the last few lap he's got lovely rubber while and they're sitting on quite 2nd hand hoops.   Obviously same would work in reverse. 93 becomes a major joker in the pack."

motogp,3d571y,montyzac,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:21:56 2015 UTC,"Well, is it really the bike, or is it the pilot (ie MM) who crashed in two races in which he could have easily gained 16-20 points (each)? One could argue that he had to ride to the limit because the bike wasn't perfect, but still, reaching the limit without actually going beyond it is part of the qualities of a rider.  It is always hard to compare riders on different bikes, you never know who really has the advantage, but should Rossi keep this consistency (9/9 podiums), it would be a demonstration of strength regardless. Plus, history shows that it is extremely difficult to compete after the age of 30. To lose against Rossi, at your peak, regardelss of any problem you might have had (with the exception of major health issues that he didn't have), it would be a big blow (NB- in terms of the GOAT conversation). This doesn't mean I don't consider MM phenomenal, because that's what he is. He'd just be slightly less phenomenal than his predecessor... However, should he come back from behind and win this one, after trailing 74 points, well I guess MM would strengthen his legacy (assuming the rest of his career lives up to expectations). On the ""more race wins"" matter, personally that's a non issue according to me. Rossi might as well go on to win the championship without winning anymore races: with 3 wins and all the podiums he had, it would already be enough (considering a realistic 4-6 more podiums in the final 9 races). After all, you win the championship if you have more points, not wins..."
motogp,3d571y,johncavenaghi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:44:08 2015 UTC,"I absolutely think Rossi is the GOAT btw, but I think you forget to take into account that Rossi and Marquez's age difference also means that Rossi has so so so much more experience than Marquez, thus MM thinking like the young hot headed rider like he is, and crashing 3 times in the first 7 races. Personally, I think it's unfair to say that bc of the age difference, if (more like when, lbr) Rossi beats Marquez it would make that feat more impressive. Yes, Rossi is older and that should mean he's less physically fit than Marquez but age also comes with priceless experience. Racecraft is as much a part of the winning formula as riding skill.   For example, we all know about Assen. A lot of people speculated that while Marquez said he had been practicing that last corner move all weekend, maybe Rossi had actually anticipated that himself bc it looked like he knew exactly what to do to save his bike. That proves that the age difference actually works in Rossi's favour. Again, just theories ofc, but the logic works.   After all those crashes I got frustrated with Marquez and the more I think the more I'm sure (and I've seen people post similar views here as well) that a lot of that comes down to his inexperience of dealing with this kind of pressure and being on a less competent bike that he's used to. A lot of people say ""He'll mature. He'll be stronger because of this"" and Rossi is already there. He's already mature and stronger.  Again, I think Rossi is already the undisputed GOAT. Hell, as great as Marquez is, without Rossi there will probably be no Marquez. I just think Rossi's age isn't necessarily a handicap."

motogp,3d571y,Sultan_of_Slide,2,Wed Jul 15 00:04:01 2015 UTC,He already is the undisputed GOAT.
motogp,3d571y,kochsson,2,Tue Jul 14 00:09:35 2015 UTC,"As many have said, he's already the GOAT by nearly all numbers and of course sheer display of talent. Ago is a legend, but the sport he raced in at the time, and the mechanical advantage he possessed means they might as well be different sports. What Rossi accomplished, and continues to accomplish is staggering, even his extremely competitive rivals are in awe of him. We're not likely to witness another sportsman of this caliber for a looong time, so let's enjoy it :)"
motogp,3d571y,agentnico,2,Wed Jul 15 10:57:13 2015 UTC,"Didn't Ago win 15 championships? For that matter, didn't Nieto win 13?  The problem is it's comparing green apples to red apples. The championships when Ago was dominant are nothing like they have been in Rossi's time. Ago was competing in multiple classes and on bikes that were better than everyone else's in seasons that were half as long."
motogp,3d571y,mavam,2,Mon Jul 13 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"You have to remember that, as good as Agostini was, he didn't race with the same level of competition that Rossi has. That's the difference. In Agostini's day people weren't born watching TV and idolizing motorcycle racing and then bred and trained to do it [a la Marquez]."

motogp,3d571y,SkinnyBobZeta,-55,Mon Jul 20 22:55:10 2015 UTC,"Calling Rossi the G.O.A.T whatever happens is a joke.  I get downvoted to oblivion just for comparing Rossi to Lance Armstrong and the truth is that it is an unfair comparison.  At least Lance Armstrong was only cheating because everyone else was doing it, and when he was caught out he had to pay the consequences, but in the case of Rossi he has a whole career dedicated to illegally getting a competitive advantage over everyone including his teammates, and when it is exposed people quickly ignore forget and dismiss all the evidence right in front of their faces.  Most people are aware that he blocked Stoner joining Yamaha and tried to do the same with Lorenzo unsuccessfully which led to him running to Ducati and being exposed as a below average rider getting outqualified by CRT bikes and getting his rear handed to him by Hayden on the regular. What most people aren't aware of is that his nickname ""the Doctor"" is actually related to the work he puts in behind the scenes in the sport to do whatever it takes to get the best bike possible as well as sabotaging his competitors including his teammates.  Most people are aware of the Rossi/Lorenzo 'wall'. Most people aren't aware that Rossi's success in the early 2000s can be attributed to a combination of special tyres he was getting flown into him by Michelin before races and being given a higher spec bike by Honda than was given to the other riders. For the last 4 races of 2002 Alex Barros was given the same spec bike as Rossi-the result? he finished on the podium every race and won twice as many races as Rossi in the same period. Rossi subsequently issued one of his patented ""it's him or me"" ultimatums to Honda which resulted in Barros leaving to join Yamaha in 2003 although he was allowed to rejoin Honda once Rossi left to Yamaha in 2004.  Most people also aren't aware that Ben Spies departure from Yamaha was actually masterminded by Rossi, who at this point was at rockbottom and knew that it would be better to get beaten regularly by Lorenzo than by Nicky Hayden. It had long been determined that Rossi was to replace Ben Spies before the latter announced it himself, this was only known by a small group of people including Stoner. This is the real reason that Stoner choose to retire, he was disgusted that a top team would willingly embrace Rossi even after he had been exposed as a fraud. As a fan of the sport it makes me sad to know that real talent like Stoner, Bradley Smith and Scott Redding will never achieve their full potential in the sport because of back handed dealings and an overrated average rider hogging one of the best rides in Motogp.   What's sad is that even Yamaha appear to have caved in, it's no coincidence that after Lorenzo won 4 races on the trot Yamaha tripped over themselves to introduce some 'updates' and all of a sudden Rossi is on top and Lorenzo is struggling.   I stand by the fact that if Rossi wins the title this season it will be without question one of the most fraudulent results in sports, and I know I will be down-voted to oblivion for bringing the truth to light but to all the real fans who want to know what is really going on in motogp, if even one of you is enlightened by my posts it's all worth it. The Rossi fans can feel free to do what they do best, downvote and turn a blind eye while waving their 46 flag but ignoring the facts doesn't change the truth.  G.O.A.T? For me it's between Stoner and Doohan but I have no doubt it will be Marquez when his career is done"

Let me give it a try:   They actually call him The Doctor because he doses himself with illegal ADHD medication in order to concentrate better in the races. He's high as a kite most of the time. He's not even Italian, that's not his accent, he slurs like that because he's doped out of his mind.  And what he did to Marquez? Valentino actually kidnapped Marquez and drugged him, then put a wig on him and convinced MM that he was a 36 year old Italian rider for Yamaha. So, while MM rode as Valentino (during the races were Valentino won, such as Argentina this season), it was actually Marquez riding the 46, and a drunk Graziano was the one crashing the 93 bike, all of this while the real VR was busy reconfiguring the chemtrail generator on his bike to control Lorenzo's mind."

motogp,3d571y,gnualmafuerte,2,Mon Jul 13 19:56:45 2015 UTC,I heard his injuries came from Graziano kicking him down the stairs for not bringing any more trophies home for said amaretto
motogp,3d571y,Kevydee,3,Mon Jul 13 22:23:54 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculous defamation. We all know Valentino sold his soul to the devil a long time ago, which made him immune to physical damage, and gave him +2 damage to the undead."

motogp,3d571y,RC211V,0,Mon Jul 13 21:16:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I believe Fraud46's mission was to expose Rossi's fans as  true believers in that Rossi could do no wrong in MotoGP, despite that he was, at times, a hard and dirty racer, and did receive some preferential treatment from those in power (Michelin, Dorna, MSMA/Yamaha, etc.)  While this may have some merit, Fraud46 discredited himself almost completely by trumping up the performances of many riders in comparision to Rossi. Especially prominent were Stoner, JLo, Marquez, and at one point, Bradley Smith. While Smith has come good on the Tech3 Yamaha, at the time, Smith was crashing out of every other race and was struggling to keep his ride.   Also, Yamaha sabotaged Ben Spies to make way for Rossi's return to Yamaha Factory Racing."

motogp,3d571y,jpoma,6,Mon Jul 13 18:04:40 2015 UTC,"Here's the deal with 2002.  That was the transition year from the 2-stroke to the 4-stroke.  Rossi was a factory rider and automatically started the season on the 4-stroke.  Barros was running on the satellite Pons team.  Honda (for whatever reason) did not give Barros a 4-stroke until later in the season.  Barros was faster with the 4-stroke.  Would he have beat Rossi during the entire season?  Who knows, but in 2001, Rossi did beat Barros on relatively equal 2-stroke machinery.  For whatever reason in 2003, Honda elected to bring Nicky Hayden as a factory rider.  Barros was offered a factory ride at Yamaha so he took it (I am not sure of this, but I suspect his satellite Pons seat was still available to him, but he decided a factory seat was better than the satellite)  Was Rossi behind it all?  He could have been influential, but given that he split way with Honda in 2004, that would suggest that Honda was not going to bend over backwards to Rossi's every whim.    Interestingly, Barros did run on the factory Honda team in 2004, and did not win a race."

motogp,3d31wx,sloCycle,11,Mon Jul 13 03:12:54 2015 UTC,Looks like Honda and Marquez are back to form. I would be excited to see him put on a huge charge to come back and challenge for the championship.
motogp,3d31wx,AznTri4d,3,Mon Jul 13 03:20:39 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see him having a good go, especially if Pedrosa hits form too - a few Honda 1-2's would keep more points away from Rossi and Lorenzo, and the Ducati's or others could also grab a couple good results, add in a crash or two each from the 2 Yamahas... A 65 point gap with 9 races left is a lot, but if Marc/Honda can really hit last year's kind of form they can definitely have a good go at it."
motogp,3d31wx,CashCarStar,4,Mon Jul 13 14:44:10 2015 UTC,So he still has a chance to win if he pushes hard?
motogp,3d31wx,Fadic4,4,Mon Jul 13 14:51:27 2015 UTC,He will have to do the maximum.

motogp,3d31wx,regisgod,2,Tue Jul 14 11:44:28 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is residual nervousness from the mess that is his first 7 races (well, 6, minus COTA i guess) but idk.. i feel like he's going to have at least one more DNF this year, esp on tracks that favours the M1 or when he gets involved in more battles."
motogp,3d31wx,dustyshelves,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:38:22 2015 UTC,"I think he will too, but there's always a chance that he doesn't, and in that case I think he'll definitely challenge for the title."

That ramming stunt at assen and the earlier wheel clip incident show us that."
motogp,3d31wx,Hatch-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:34:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. it's just how he rides now I suppose. I was never this nervous last year lol. Previously people were still hoping that he would realise he couldn't ride like that after he kept crashing, but now that the championship is out of his hands, it seems like he's even more sure about the whole ""all or nothing"" thing bc he's got nothing to lose."
motogp,3d31wx,dustyshelves,2,Wed Jul 15 08:56:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's completely out of the question for him to have a run similar to Vettel in 2012.  He went into Spa 42 points down and in third place, 11 races done, 9 to go.    He might not win the championship this year, but he could make things tense come the end of the season."

I am still hoping Vale can get that 10th title this year though."
motogp,3d31wx,oscarcbr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:12:10 2015 UTC,"He needs to make 7.5ish more points per race to beat rossi, which really means he needs Pedrosa or Lorenzo in second for the remainder of the season to win this.

motogp,3d31wx,Hatch-,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:31:14 2015 UTC,Crazy how much more comfortable he is on last years frame.  Wonder how drastic the differences are.  Anyone know if Pedrosa is still running the new frame for this year?
motogp,3d31wx,bpi89,2,Mon Jul 13 14:55:26 2015 UTC,"Bt sport had a quick interview with Livio Suppo before the race. He said that Danis frame was an evolution of the 2014 frame. And the one Marquez started this year on was a 2015 design but as you now know, Marquez is now on a 2014 frame."
motogp,3d31wx,AndyPan,2,Mon Jul 13 22:58:46 2015 UTC,"I heard both honda riders experienced widely varying response from the bike under heavy braking, so that when you pooosh it (bery ard) you couldn't be sure how it would respond. The old frame just responded better under load."
motogp,3d31wx,Hatch-,0,Tue Jul 14 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"There's absolutely no way Marquez could win the championship. He could win every race for the rest of the season, and if Rossi podiums for the rest of the season, which he has, and gets no less than 4 third place finishes (assuming he won't win anymore races, also unlikely) he'll still beat Marquez by 1 point.   If Rossi wins 1 more race, the deficit climbs to 11 points. This is also discounting Lorenzo and Pedrosa winning any more races in the second half.   Marc's 3rd title shot rests on a lot of very unlikely ""what ifs"". Sorry to burst your bubble."
motogp,3d31wx,Alarmtheday,2,Tue Jul 14 07:27:24 2015 UTC,"We know this. No bubble bursted there I think XD  Mathematically it's possible but ofc there's only a very very very very tiny possibility it will actually happen. It's out of his hands now. Not only does he have to win the remaining 9 races, he'll have to rely on other riders performing well enough to be buffers between him and Rossi, or just hope that Rossi crashes, in which case he will still have Jorge to fight for the title."
motogp,3d31wx,dustyshelves,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:28:40 2015 UTC,"one crash from either tosses everything out the window, and since they both seem to end up in a position to help the other off the track it's likely to happen."

Thats such a crock that marquez cant come to grips with the 2015 chassis so they just take the new engine and jam it into last years.

motogp,3d31wx,blacksnake03,2,Tue Jul 14 06:09:26 2015 UTC,"Well Honda aren't the only one doing it. Yamaha also introduced new chassis in Assen, and they could also jam their engine into last year's chassis if they want to.  There are rules in place to prevent certain manufacturers from having too much advantage over the others (like the engine development freeze). Suzuki improved immensely when they got their new engine a few races ago. Is that also a crock?"

motogp,3d31wx,Marshall498,4,Tue Jul 14 18:44:08 2015 UTC,"I think you're trying to say the failure of the honda chassis design is the fault of marquez. If Marquez is such a miserable failure why does he look so good on the old frame? Isn't it just logical to assume the engineers may have come up with a design that looked good on paper but flexed erratically under load in use?  I know people love to hate on riders for any reason they can get, but there are lots of reasons a frame might not perform well."
motogp,3d31wx,Hatch-,0,Tue Jul 14 20:12:11 2015 UTC,I am fingers crossed but feel its a bit early to say if the old frame has worked totally.  He had a win and a 2nd place with the new 2015 bike and a fastest lap of the race in Spain before he nearly took Jorge out.  He did look better though. Although he owns at that track.
motogp,3d31wx,montyzac,2,Tue Jul 14 21:04:00 2015 UTC,"He too will figure it out.   You're comparing totally different things here. Tyres ≠ a whole damn bike. They can't fix the engine so they do what they can, which is to fix the chassis and the software. They don't have the time to design and test new chassis, so they use the old one. If Jorge's team had been allowed to somehow take out parts of the tyres and fix it to better fit him that was exactly what they would have done."

motogp,3d60bd,gnualmafuerte,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:32:33 2015 UTC,"Generally, I have an issue with videos and motorcycles. There are only three possible soundtracks to match to motorcycles: a) The sound of the Engines b) Rock/Metal/Punk c) Classical. I'd rather go with a) or b), but c) works well sometimes. I like a) better most of the time specially if it's MotoGP. Less Nick Harris blabbering, more engine sound!  But most motorcycle videos are paired to either electronic crap, or, worse, rap (usually stunt videos). It's awful. Specially when we have shit like this, this, or this."

March to the Grave is awesome, it's simple, rudimentary punk, nothing fancy, just by the numbers like Punk is supposed to be! Go Valentino Go! Awesome. Second link there ... come on man! After all this years, Fuel is still an Anthem. And how could anyone possibly dislike Saxon? Motorcycle man is a classic!"
motogp,3d60bd,damnhippie2011,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:36:02 2015 UTC,"Silly me... finally I did it myself, oh well.  Because I find fuel to have a cringeworthy text and I really dislike that period of Metallica. Punk just sounds totally wrong to me for that. There is not much I'm willing to say against Saxon but they are just not my style.  There are some instances where I like music on motorcycling videos, especially onboard stuff. Sometimes it can be either electronic music, faster metal, even hardcore or even tranquil hip hop. It all depends on the song, the video, the riding style displayed in it and the context. But it so rarely happens that I really like how it's done that I'm just happy with just an engine soundtrack. I also can see that you would probably would dislike my choice of music, so might others. That's why unplugged is the way to go.  Also music always forces some kind of emotion onto you and deceives you from the actual sensation. Even this beatifully done video gives you the impression of grace, tranquillity and some kind of studied choreography. The noise, the adrenalin, the determenation of the riders is somewhat lost in this video. I do like this video but it's kind of an exception."

Still better and not as cringey as all the shit Metallica did after 2000. They were both ethically and musically death after the Napster fiasco.  In any case, I agree, nothing beats the raw engine sounds."

I thought he was genuine as they come, and didn't have time for the flowery bullshit we get so often in modern motorsports. Once in a lifetime talent that we had for far too short a period of time. Casey winning on the Desmosedici with the carbon fiber chassis is easily the greatest feat of the last 10 years in MotoGP."

motogp,3czn2m,Armored_Ape,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:17:36 2015 UTC,"I liked him up until the remarks he made to Rossi when Vale was apologizing for the late corner attack that ended with Stoner out of the race. Him saying ""your ambition out-weighs your talent"" was pathetic and quite telling about him as a person."
motogp,3czn2m,126CK_1981,3,Tue Jul 14 01:22:39 2015 UTC,"Casey had more natural talent than Rossi, or any rider since the end of the 500cc world championship. Too bad he didn't come around 25-30 years ago as he would have fit in better in those days. But, what he did at Ducati is nothing short of stunning when one considers that the last time a rider not named Stoner won on the Desmosedici was 8 years ago now when Capirossi had that lone win that year. Yeah, he's not a likeable person to many, but I've never lost sight of what his talent level was. The personality thing is all bullshit and detracts from the on-track rider.   Here's the thing about that statement, it's par for the course when you're dealing with egomaniacs, something all of them happen to be. Some are just better at pandering to the media and the crowd to hide the fact that they are raving lunatics at the end of the day. To make it to that level, even if you're not overtly stating it, you have to be an egomaniac as the confidence and self-belief is far beyond what your average person possesses."
motogp,3czn2m,Karl_Vos,2,Tue Jul 14 19:34:30 2015 UTC,Not really. If a rider other than Rossi attempted that move there would of have been an investigation. Rossi didn't have a chance of making that pass. And are you forgetting about Rossi giving biaggi the middle finger in the middle of a corner in a race. That's a tad more disrespectful don't you think?
motogp,3czn2m,Armored_Ape,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:09:24 2015 UTC,"What? Biaggi attempted to force Rossi right off the track on purpose. That is the absolute worst example in this case. Rossi certainly was very late on the brakes in the Stoner scenario, but he freely admitted to making the mistake. Colossal difference: accident versus outright attacking another rider - did you forget that part?"
motogp,3czn2m,Karl_Vos,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:38:04 2015 UTC,Rossi was going to try anything to get past stoner there and new he wouldn't make the corner. For the goat that's terrible decision making.

Roger Hayden crashed in my corner, bike sprawled in the gravel and everything.  Roger picked up his bike before I got there and when I did get there, I reached for the handle bars. He basically tugged the bike away and got on. Turns out the bike was still running somehow and we helped push the bike back on the track. He ended up pitting and that was it for his race.  I was always a bit embarrassed and I look back on the event and cringe because I nearly pressed the engine kill switch when he tugged the bike away.

motogp,3cz81c,RobotVandal,19,Mon Jul 13 15:07:08 2015 UTC,"Marshal for Montmeló here. Although I don't have the FIM license, I'm familiar with the rules (I'll apply for it next year). The Marshals are required to lift a bike that has fallen in the gravel by the front wheel for a couple of seconds to empty the fairing of all the gravel that gets in. Marshaling is an ungrateful job because the riders see you as the enemy, but rules are there to be enforced. If you go back to the track and start laying a bed of gravel that will endanger the lives of the rest of the grid and I didn't do everything that I could to prevent it, I'm going to be scolded by Race Direction. Human lives are much more important than your race (in this case it's even worse as it was a FP). Marshals are the authority on track. If that man deemed the bike as unsafe, he has every right to kill the engine and ask for a truck to get it back to the pit lane. Wether he is right or wrong will be decided later if the team appeals... although Race Direction will have sided with the Marshal in this one 100%. But, having said that, he did overcommit here. We are not, under any circumstance except if the medical services require us to do so, allowed to touch the rider. We are not there to fight with them. If the rider is already getting on the bike you're hopeless. All you can do is inform them but if they want to break the rules, it's their decision. You file a report for Race Direction and they take care of it... except F1 and MotoGP are a bit special for that because politics are strong with these ones.  For example: Yesterday I was there for the first shift of the 24h of Catalunya of motorbikes. In endurance races, if the bike breaks down, the only one who can get it to the box is a rider (usually there are 4 by team) in full gear. Teams sometimes don't know the rules or they act as such to try to get away with it. Yesterday in Montmeló it was 35º with high humidity so carrying a hot bike for maybe a kilometer or more by foot in full leathers and helmet was a bit unpleasant. The red cross had to take care of a couple of dehydrated riders, one of them was even taken to the medical centre! Well, knowing that, if a rider comes in shorts and a t-shirt to pick up the bike, there's nothing you can do to prevent it, but you should inform him and then file a report.  I hope this gives a little insight of what's going on with Fenati there. Young riders are the hardest to deal with, as most of them come through a wealthy upbringing and are spoiled little things who don't know a NO for an answer... you can see it in the gif.  TL; DR: Do what the Marshal says"
motogp,3cz81c,albertgrajera,4,Sun Jul 12 08:38:46 2015 UTC,Can anyone explain wth was going on here? Why did the marshals eventually give up and let him rejoin?
motogp,3cz81c,Why_is_this_so,3,Sun Jul 12 04:09:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the rules, why aren't they letting him continue? Do they think that the bike is damaged and dangerous to race?"
motogp,3cz81c,Ktmktmktm,5,Sun Jul 12 07:56:17 2015 UTC,"Yup, it had plastics hanging off, and one piece did come off later onto the track. It's dangerous to other riders, just a piece of fairing could cause somebody else to crash."

Few minutes after I posted that comment my PSU died and I had to run to the office (car at the mechanic, motorcycle waiting for parts, wasn't easy), by the time I got back the race was over. I'm sleep and race deprived. And MM won.   Still, WHY would I flag a post BEFORE the race? you don't have to know my timezone! If you hover above the ""x hours ago"" text, it tells you WHEN it was made. This subreddit is FULL of predictions done every day, you can't pretend people to flag PREDICTIONS as spoilers if they are done before the race! Also, this subreddit doesn't have spoiler tags.   How about this:   SPOILER: MotoGP 2074 at the Mars Base Circuit. Android VR46 still having problems qualifying, Lorenzo Hologram still unpopular and awkward."

motogp,3d014b,aDDnTN,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:00:15 2015 UTC,"FYI, the euro feeds don't have commercials during the race. It would be like putting commercials in during the World Cup match.  You will actually miss important stuff with the commercials on Fox Sports, they don't give a shit about the race or what they are showing. they just put them in at regular intervals. They don't show the podiums after the race and often cut the program short to broadcast something else. Also, they will move coverage to a different time and not update your DVR settings.   I've only watched it on FS1 a few times, when i didn't really have any other choice (no computer access). The picture looks great, but then they cut to a commercial and when you get back, someone has wrecked and the positions have been shuffled. It's just not worth the frustrations."

Maisto is decent, from the one I own, the 1/6th scale Ducati,  it's all plastic, it's huge and for 35bux totally worth it, it looks good.  Now, you want real nice detail and quality,  Minichamps will range from $60-$250 depending on the rider, etc. Ebay & amazon are where I source mine,  also there are some sweet 1/5 scale motogp and 500cc riders replica helmets for sale online that look great beside their bike. Alternatively you can buy a relatively cheap 1/12 scale Tamiya motorcycle kit, paint and make it yourself and save some $$$ if you're up for model making."

For example, I pre-ordered the Marquez and Stoner Honda bikes over a year ago just after they were announced, I'll let you know if I ever get them...  But still, they are really good, I love my Simoncelli bike.  You'll get better detail from a Tamiya as stated above, as long as you have the skill to do it."

Both Honda's badly exposed Rossi's lack of speed , it's just a shame that Pedrosa had injury issues and Rossi has been allowed to win multiple races by barging with Marquez without any punishment from race direction or the championship would be more interesting. If Rossi wins the title this season it will be one of the most fraudulent results in sports up there with Lance Armstrong's Tour de France victories."

Dani's misfortune was that he felt he was on a very good lap and if he could not take advantage of it as it happen, he needed to change the tires. He was angry because he thought that Cal saw him, which is a fair assumption, but it really doesn't seem like Cal to do something like this."
motogp,3cxzsw,motorboatnowork,-1,Sun Jul 12 08:33:15 2015 UTC,So you're saying Dani was upset that he was potentially denied accomplishing something more than he actually accomplished for qualifying?  Is that common for all humans?

In spite of his ""habit"" of crashing, he is still better than half the top 30 MC racers in the world, including #69 Nicky Hayden the only American and just about all of the Asian riders.  People around here just talk trash, but they would suck his cock to be half as good a rider.   This is premier world class motorcycle racing, not everyone can be the best.

Lot of folks in this sub conveniently overlook that, in their mind somehow he didn't ""win"" it the right way. The dude was consistent as fuck, also overcame his teammate crashing him out of a race.

In my defense, Crutchlow did his first GP in 2011 and he's 4 years younger than Hayden.  In 2014, Crutchlow was 13th in the Championship and Hayden was 14th.  Right now, 2015, despite all those crashes/DNFs Cal is in 8th and even with all those completed races Nicky is 21st."

motogp,3czrh6,Subtlefart,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:40:26 2015 UTC,What exactly confuses you?
motogp,3czrh6,ChlupLFC,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:34:12 2015 UTC,For starters I was having a lot of trouble even finding what time the trace started today. The English motoGP site just said 8:00; I assumed it was pm :(. The site (firstrowsports) I usually use to stream non-local sporting events didn't seem to carry it. Sucks I just missed it.
motogp,3czrh6,Subtlefart,2,Sun Jul 12 18:43:03 2015 UTC,"Oh I use that site to stream football matches. I think there's an option on the very top of the page for ""Motosports"" or sth like that. I use this other site when I need to stream motogp though. I'll PM you bc we're not allowed to post streaming links in this sub.  Edit: PM sent! Also, as a rule of thumb, most races are held during the day. The only night race is Qatar, which has been the opening race of the season for a while now :)"

motogp,3czrh6,Some_Random_Guy_1138,7,Sun Jul 12 07:22:14 2015 UTC,"Check out the youtube channel of motogp. They have some ""classic"" races for free up there.  When subscribing (to the official site) keep in mind that, in the previous years, they reduced the price at the halfway point. We are nearing that so keep that in mind. It would be a shame paying full price just before the halfway point.   Full price is 99€ for an entire season (march-november). The multipass option (multiple camera angles) is not necessary."
motogp,3czrh6,MrHall,2,Sun Jul 12 07:53:05 2015 UTC,"http://motogp.com  Not sure, price depends on area and how far we are into the season. Although I seem to recall in was about $130 for me at the end of last season. Worth it."

motogp,3d0ypd,asdjfweaiv,3,Sun Jul 12 19:06:15 2015 UTC,"Valentino has said it over and over again: As long as he's competitive, he's gonna keep racing. Last season when asked about bringing back his creative victories, he said he was grown up now, but they might would return after he accumulated more wins.   He has a lot of chances this championship, and while MM seems to be back in shape, and Lorenzo is very close, he's still leading, and still getting podiums and accumulating points.  Just go a bit over his interviews, there is ZERO interest in retiring, and Yamaha is more than happy to have him.   But, regarding your question, VR already answered it for you, kinda. In a recent interview they asked him about Lorenzo, and who would replace him should Lorenzo leave Yamaha, and he said that certainly Pol Espargarò, as he was already very good at racing a Yamaha, and he deserved a factory position.   So, there you go. VR thinks the next up for a spot in Factory Yamaha would be Pol, but he's not getting up from that seat any time soon."

You only have to look at Casey Stoner's mysterious retirement and being denied the opportunity to ride in Dani's absence despite being told the door will always be open for him by Honda to realize that.  And the truth is Rossi will pull strings and stay for as long as he wants. Only Rossi could have landed a factory Yamaha ride after how he was exposed on the Ducati. It's not about who deserves the ride it's about politics and it is clear that Rossi has many people in his pocket from Dorna down to the fans, you only have to look at how all my posts get downvoted for speaking the truth as proof."

motogp,3cvbi4,oh84s,5,Sat Jul 11 03:05:33 2015 UTC,"Lorenzo looked up to him a bit initially, noticeable by his crude imitations of Valentino's celebrations in his first 2 years. It was Rossi who soured the relationship from the get-go (remember the pitwall), though Rossi had his reasons and it was to do with Yamaha rather than Lorenzo himself.  Rossi apparently blocked a deal between Yamaha and Stoner for 2006 or 2007, then when they wanted Lorenzo he threatened to leave. His reasoning was that after giving Yamaha their first championship (well 2) since Rainey they were under the impression he was getting older and would need to future-proof themselves. So he saw them wanting Stoner/Lorenzo as trying to replace him. He also wanted to make sure the bike would be developed around his feedback. He left them on good terms when he went to Ducati, and he and Lorenzo have had respect for each other after Rossi's humbling failure there."
motogp,3cvbi4,sembello,6,Sat Jul 11 03:13:04 2015 UTC,Yeah Lorenzo's celebrations were awful. It was clear he was trying to be Rossi v2. I'm glad he's settled down with them.
motogp,3cvbi4,oh84s,8,Sat Jul 11 03:14:43 2015 UTC,I loved every bit of it. The astronaut celebration was better than Rossi has ever done! I wish he would do more outrageous stuff like that again!

Of course Lorenzo fancies himself as the better rider, but not for the reasons you think. He is Rossi's teammate. They are both on the same bike, arguably the best bike on the grid. As the saying goes, the first person you want to beat is your teammate. Then there's also the mental side of it. Lorenzo knows he is capable of coming in front of Rossi.

motogp,3cv9wa,oh84s,3,Sun Jul 12 09:55:54 2015 UTC,Honda are back. MM should win this race. Lorenzo is primed from there to challenge for the Rossi v Lorenzo battle.

motogp,3cv9wa,VRWolf46,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:45:18 2015 UTC,"This is a super noob question but I've always wondered why everyone always sets super fast times in like, the last 3 mins of the sessions (FP and Qualifying). Can anyone give me an explanation on this? Is this part of the strategy? Or does it have to do with the bikes getting better for some reason towards the end?"
motogp,3cv9wa,dustyshelves,2,Sat Jul 11 08:46:32 2015 UTC,Its a mix of strategy and the track rubbering in. Most riders use the majority of the FP sessions to do race stints and test settings and updates then do a qualy run at the end.
motogp,3cv9wa,tekkentool,2,Sat Jul 11 08:57:08 2015 UTC,"Ooh thanks a lot! Ofc, that makes a lot of sense. I wondered why no one ever tried to do it the other way round just to mix things up, like set a super quick lap at the start and then just focus on the race pace after getting that over with lol, but I never thought about the part about the track rubbering in!"
motogp,3cv9wa,bilko_racing,3,Sat Jul 11 09:04:21 2015 UTC,More to the point crashing out at the start of an FP because you were pushing too hard is far more detrimental than with 1 or 2 minutes to go.
motogp,3cv9wa,TetsuoSama,2,Sat Jul 11 10:02:03 2015 UTC,They do do it the other way round if they think it's going to rain!
motogp,3cv9wa,budgetpharmaceutical,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:55:31 2015 UTC,"The modern qualifying format puts the riders into two qualifying sessions based on their best time from the first three practice sessions.  If they can't be sure that the next session is going to have faster conditions (eg. track temperature), it makes sense to put in a fast lap to try keep in the top ten overall."

motogp,3csefy,cantpee,2,Fri Jul 10 16:09:56 2015 UTC,It seems like a pretty good way to advertise/promote the game; maybe you can get the publisher on board?

motogp,3csefy,DeathMagnet1C,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:08:26 2015 UTC,I tried for hours last weekend to get below 1:20 and I couldn't. 1:19 requires almost no mistakes and a lot of wide open throttle.

motogp,3csefy,bitbangdub,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:58:11 2015 UTC,"I've played gran turismo ever since the first one came out, and have come to know Laguna seca from it.   My video game lap times have always been super consistent and decent, but after riding and driving it in real life i dropped a few seconds in the game. I think there are nuances to elevation change they model in the game's physics that are too subtle to visually see in the game, but you know to prepare for once you experience the real thing."
motogp,3csefy,nightscout1,2,Sat Jul 11 00:14:21 2015 UTC,"I kind of figured something like that would happen.

motogp,3csefy,kroatia04,2,Fri Jul 10 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"I don't really have context, but everyone sounds a little weird to me in interviews. Cal Crutchlow sometimes has a weird accent going on. Nicky Hayden sometimes uses phrases that aren't that common in typical spoken American English.  I think when you spend so much time with different (Spanish/Italian) Europeans, you pick up some of their language mannerisms. I suspect Bradl has picked this up, too."

motogp,3ctiki,ZaphodPrefect,8,Fri Jul 10 17:28:48 2015 UTC,They have giant trucks full of parts...frames/swingarms/bodywork/levers and clip ons galore. The only thing they dont have is engines.   So if they crash...they replace everything that even smells bent.
motogp,3ctiki,Marshall498,4,Fri Jul 10 17:36:45 2015 UTC,"They have spares, but for parts like frames the supply is not unlimited. I assume they have dimensions of all parts available, and it's easy to measure / check frame, forks, etc. for straightness, other bits are easy to swap out."
motogp,3ctiki,bitaria,5,Fri Jul 10 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"I wondered this a lot too; how can they tell if a crash hasn't slightly deformed a chassis? The speeds they crash at could easily do that!  This must surely be something they test for? Maybe tweet a question at Alex Briggs, he replies to alot of questions like this."
motogp,3ctiki,ross_rossifumi,3,Fri Jul 10 20:24:08 2015 UTC,I imagine they have a jig or something of some sort that they bolt it up to and check it for squareness and such.

motogp,3ctiki,Bikerguy7,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:26:56 2015 UTC,"They never say failures or retirements are because of a previous crash, but I imagine every now and then an unexplained retirement would have to be because of something that was missed.

motogp,3cra4r,vin97,6,Fri Jul 10 13:37:07 2015 UTC,I so badly wanted Bradl to run away with that race!
motogp,3cra4r,cantpee,3,Fri Jul 10 05:47:48 2015 UTC,"He did! for about 8 laps IIRC. Poor guy, probably should have changed tyres like the rest, but it was exactly the right move for the team and sponsers! Leading for 8 laps at home is not to be sniffed at"
motogp,3cra4r,paystey,2,Fri Jul 10 09:07:32 2015 UTC,"If I remember rightly, Bradl was riding a bike that - although it had slicks - had everything else set up for the wet, and thus didn't stand a chance against the full dry bikes of the others."
motogp,3cra4r,mirador1987,4,Fri Jul 10 10:29:27 2015 UTC,They got everything set up for dry conditions except the fork springs. While changing the shock someone dropped a spacer. They found the spacer and got the shock swapped out but it delayed proceedings enough that they ran out of time before they could change the fork springs.  With the softer fork springs Bradl couldn't brake as hard without bottoming out the forks and crashing.
motogp,3cra4r,squinkk,2,Fri Jul 10 18:40:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember this being the case. They changed his tires on the grid at the last moment before the warm-up lap, but the bike was still set up for a wet race. It looked like a brilliant move at first, but he was losing almost two seconds a lap to Marquez.   I really, really wanted him to win at Laguna Seca, Qatar, and Sachsenring. I have immense respect for him and I believe he still has some untapped potential. It just doesn't seem that he's going to get a competitive ride -- there are so many amazing riders on the grid.   Maybe KTM will sign him."
motogp,3cra4r,cantpee,3,Fri Jul 10 15:31:27 2015 UTC,Ohh man I remember watching that race so clearly! It was epic watching the aliens carve their way through the field. Definitely one of my favourite races of 2014
motogp,3cra4r,_Lo2W_,2,Fri Jul 10 10:31:01 2015 UTC,What happened exactly? Why'd half the grid start from the pit lane?
motogp,3cra4r,Terra27,3,Fri Jul 10 07:13:06 2015 UTC,"They decided to change bikes (tyres) at the last moment, after the warm up lap IIRC. At that point they had to start from pit lane since they couldn't line up on the grid."
motogp,3cra4r,Myrelin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:55:22 2015 UTC,Why'd they decide to change the tyres?
motogp,3cra4r,Terra27,2,Fri Jul 10 09:46:43 2015 UTC,"So they initially lined up on the grid (and for the warm-up lap) on wet tyres, with a couple of riders like Bradl on slicks. On the warm-up lap, the ones on wet tyres decided to change to slicks as they judged the track to be dry enough. They had to dive into the pitlane to change to slicks, while the few riders who were already on slicks had a nice advantage at the start.  Bradl started from the front row, and there were a few riders on row 6-7 (IIRC) that also started from the grid. Everyone else squished together at the pitlane exit."
motogp,3cra4r,Myrelin,2,Fri Jul 10 10:01:05 2015 UTC,"The track conditions changed that fast. At grid the track looked wet, but after warm up lap they all realized it was dry enough, getting drier so they switched back to full race slicks. Rules meant they couldn't re-grid so they mostly started from pits. Those that chose to keep on the rain tires had some aggressive first few laps but the dry track quickly chewed away their tires and the riders that pitted took over. Some or all of the rain tires choosers then pitted to switch, but lost a lot of time, so the move to stay on rain tires at grid was unfortunatly not the best decision as far as the podium. As stated, Bradl staying on the grid and having some momentous first sets of laps on his home track was great for himself and his sponsor, getting in the limelight, but overall poorly affected his placing in the race."
motogp,3cra4r,locustt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:02:23 2015 UTC,"Oh okay, so Bradl took the gamble to stay on wet tyres and start from the grid?"
motogp,3cra4r,Terra27,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:31:17 2015 UTC,"Bradl had slick tyres (which was good) but the setup of the bike was for the rain (so electronics, suspension, etc. were all softer and therefore not optimal).

With Faster I got the impression it would just be a documentary on MotoGP and I expected fastest would focus on Rossi, but also Lorenzo and Stoner. But yet it was primarily just about Rossi.  Kind of reminded me of the Senna documentary, only about Rossi."
motogp,3cs0i0,oh84s,3,Fri Jul 10 08:50:57 2015 UTC,Stoner and Lorenzo got a decent amount of focus. It focused more on Rossi than Faster but yeah. That's where the money is though.
motogp,3cs0i0,ElectReaver,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:11:16 2015 UTC,"I always thought they were more background to the story about Rossi in that film. Which was disappointing, I never really got the feeling ""Faster"" was the ""Rossi movie"", it was just about him because he was by far the fastest rider at the time."
motogp,3cs0i0,RC211V,5,Fri Jul 10 09:13:26 2015 UTC,"They are both supposed to be about MotoGP, its just that Rossi is such a massive part of MotoGP. It's like talking about boxing and leaving out Ali or Tyson.  Just to give you an idea of how big Rossi is, I was in Prague and walked down an alley and there's a store with just Rossi merchandise.   Picture from their FB page."
motogp,3cs0i0,ElectReaver,3,Fri Jul 10 11:02:05 2015 UTC,Holy shit. Do you know what the prices are like? Affordable?
motogp,3cs0i0,oh84s,2,Fri Jul 10 11:14:18 2015 UTC,"I think it was the same as buying from his online store or at a track, maybe a bit cheaper considering shipping. If you are in Prague I would definitely recommend you check it out just to see it!"

motogp,3cs6u1,bladek23,5,Fri Jul 10 10:02:26 2015 UTC,"Pons is a liability. 2nd time he's torpedoed Salom this season, crashes almost every time he's on the bike...why does this guy still have a ride? This has been going on for years."
motogp,3cs6u1,CashCarStar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:59:44 2015 UTC,He is the son of Sito Pons. World Champion and Team Manager of the Paginas Amarillas team. Luis Salom's team.   Sito will be proud.
motogp,3cs6u1,carlesd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:25:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, I know who Sito is...but him being Axel's dad shouldn't guarantee him a ride. Especially when he's not even in his dad's team - I can't see why any other team would think he's a good rider to have?"
motogp,3cs6u1,CashCarStar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:17:11 2015 UTC,"I ask the same about crutchlow. Seems that single lap speed matters a lot to race team. First, you have to be fast and then you have to not crash?"
motogp,3cs6u1,ZaphodPrefect,5,Fri Jul 10 17:22:32 2015 UTC,"But that's the difference, isn't it? Crutchlow, when he's stayed on the bike, has got some pretty good results. Pons hasn't even got that - this is his 8th season in Grand Prix racing and he's had a total of 5 top 10 finishes, the best being an 8th. Never finished above 23rd in a championship, highest season points total is 28...at least when Crutchlow stays on the bike he can be quick."
motogp,3cs6u1,CashCarStar,2,Fri Jul 10 19:55:32 2015 UTC,They say it's easier to teach a fast guy not to crash than it is to teach a slower guy to be faster.
motogp,3cs6u1,lotionpotion,2,Fri Jul 10 18:14:57 2015 UTC,I believe this because there are a ton of example of crashers that have single lap speed that get premium drives.   The counter to that is that all the world champions aren't and never were crashers.

motogp,3cs6u1,CashCarStar,2,Fri Jul 10 19:58:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had thought of Marc when writing that but decided that he is just on the side of not crashing too much...obviously this is highly subjective."
motogp,3cs6u1,ZaphodPrefect,3,Fri Jul 10 21:38:44 2015 UTC,Yeesh. Alot of legs getting caught up in wheels lately.
motogp,3cs6u1,Sugomi,2,Fri Jul 10 13:20:40 2015 UTC,"I started watching motogp this season, I love it so far, but I can't accommodate to these crashes, most of them look so violent.   It's really different to f1, where most of the drivers just jump out of their car without a scratch."
motogp,3cq9d9,SeeWhatIDidTheir,22,Thu Jul 9 22:21:25 2015 UTC,Of course he would.   This is RACING not a trackday. These guys are paid to win.
motogp,3cq9d9,Marshall498,4,Thu Jul 9 22:53:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly. You take risks in racing. This one just happened to not pay off for Marquez, and because it was against Rossi some people on this sub act like it was some kind of heinous act... I feel like if something like this happened with Iannone or Rossi (people who are well-liked on this sub) making that move against Lorenzo (someone who a lot of people here dislike), we'd be seeing a much different reaction to the incident."
motogp,3cq9d9,CashCarStar,8,Fri Jul 10 00:18:20 2015 UTC,"It's not the move that's the problem, that - while aggressive - I'd classify as ""well, he had to give it a shot"". It's the comments that followed - and are still going on - that are the problem. Moral victory? Because Rossi ""cut the corner""? Come on."
motogp,3cq9d9,Myrelin,2,Fri Jul 10 00:22:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, the comments after are a totally different issue, but I've seen a lot of people on here complain about the fact the move was even attempted, which I think is kind of ridiculous."
motogp,3cq9d9,CashCarStar,3,Fri Jul 10 00:26:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, I didn't see many negative comments regarding the move, just about his ramblings after. I don't think it was a move that he could have possibly pulled off with Rossi there, but still. Last corner, last lap. He had to try. And if it was another rider, maybe they would have waved him past for the win, who knows."
motogp,3cq9d9,Myrelin,2,Fri Jul 10 00:31:49 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I think any decent racer in Marc's position would've done the same as he did, and that any decent racer in Valentino's position would've done the same as him, too."
motogp,3cq9d9,CashCarStar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:46:25 2015 UTC,"Nope.  I'm not a fan of JLo, and still didn't like MM's move on him at Jerez when he punted him off line.  MM was some ways back when he dive bombed Rossi.  There are risky moves, and then there are Marquez moves."
motogp,3cq9d9,motorboatnowork,12,Fri Jul 10 10:24:48 2015 UTC,"I think Marc's move was actually fine. It was the only thing he could do to win, he did what he had to to give himself a shot at winning but the fact is Rossi doesn't have to just stand up and let him through. You can't cut the corner but you also can't force someone off the track. Regardless of whether Rossi could have avoided contact and just let Marc through is irrelevant because he doesn't have to he's the leader."
motogp,3cq9d9,x2Infinity,7,Thu Jul 9 22:44:53 2015 UTC,his move was deff on the more aggressive side and imo he wasn't close enough to pull it off regardless of how rossi took the corner but i don't blame him for trying.
motogp,3cq9d9,Big_douche,2,Fri Jul 10 00:13:51 2015 UTC,"Cutting the track is fine if you've been pushed off/gain no advantage. Rossi never intended to cut it, this is 100% not at fault. Also, he was in the lead the whole time. The only reason why Marc was in the clear was because Rossi didn't crash. Rossi isn't the person who should have to worry about avoiding contact. Marquez has tried to be aggressive with Rossi before and it hasn't worked."
motogp,3cq9d9,KICKERMAN360,11,Fri Jul 10 04:29:32 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, just sssh already. Him and Suppo both.  Repeating the move is one thing (though I don't think he could have pulled it off with Rossi there) - and I think Rossi himself said he would probably have tried too, but as for the rest I really wish he'd just stop talking.   Rossi didn't show all the riders anything new, this situation has happened in the past at Assen (in many variations, though 2002 one is almost exactly the same), and Rossi was in the lead. So just hush about the moral victory and cutting the chicane part. He pushed another rider off the racing line, who made it across the gravel and maintained his position. End of story.  I really like Marc, but I don't understand what he's doing off track at the moment. And why."
motogp,3cq9d9,Myrelin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:35:19 2015 UTC,It's clear to me that Rossi has really gotten under his skin. He's no longer the golden boy of MotoGP and his attitude seems to have taken a turn towards the negative despite what he says in the press conferences. I liked him a lot more last season as a person.
motogp,3cq9d9,someshooter,0,Fri Jul 10 21:30:45 2015 UTC,Calm down.
motogp,3cq9d9,Jaajaja,0,Fri Jul 10 07:22:45 2015 UTC,"It does seem a bit strange, Marquez should just be riding cleanly and picking up wins were possible but instead there is some war of the media going on. I understand that journalists ask qustions and riders answer, but he does seem fairly aggressive about it all."
motogp,3cq9d9,oh84s,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:47:13 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it's just a matter of Rossi getting in his head.  He's a master of that shit.  Between chopping MM's front tire a few races back and now the contact/cut corner win at Assen, Rossi has him on his heels a bit.  MM is used to stuffing it in and making it work.  Rossi is making him pay for it.  He's being bested (for now) at his own game, and I'm not sure he knows what to make of it."
motogp,3cq9d9,elephino1,0,Fri Jul 10 13:07:56 2015 UTC,"I understand that journalists ask qustions and riders answer, but he does seem fairly aggressive about it all.   Yeah, that's the part I don't get either. This isn't the first time (not by a long shot) that journos bait him, he just never gave in to them in the past; usually just laughed it off.   I'll be honest I looked over the footage several times to see if Rossi did something underhanded that could explain Marc's anger, but if he did I couldn't spot it. Maybe it's just frustration over having a difficult bike, and being - from his point of view - in a position to win for the first time in a while and then not managing that made him angry, who knows.   As for the riding cleanly and picking up wins - yeah maybe it's what he should be doing, but he's had a bit of a crash or win mindset for years and it looks like it's not about to change soon. On the one hand it makes his riding extremely enjoyable to watch, but on the other hand - he lost a lot of points this season already. He could be a lot closer to the top in the championship than he is, and consistency (and few/no retirements) win titles."
motogp,3cq9d9,Myrelin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:55:42 2015 UTC,"He seemed pissy that Rossi cut the track and maintained position more than anything. Which I can kind of relate to him in, he felt he had the inside line. But considering how aggressive he was with his move I don't think he really left Rossi that much choice in were to go.   It was a bit marginal for both parties but I don't really think there was a clear party in the wrong. I'm surprised there is that much drama. Marquez is getting a reputation for aggressive moves and it was just another one.   He could be a lot closer to the top in the championship than he is, and consistency (and few/no retirements) win titles.   There is no reason why Marquez couldn't be right in the title this year if not for his crashes. His bike hasn't been the outright best, but I don't think its been that bad. He could have been on the podium at every race."
motogp,3cq9d9,oh84s,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:00:38 2015 UTC,"But it's a moot point; the inside line doesn't matter, if you haven't gained the position. Which is exactly what he himself stated in the press conference too, since his plan was to make the first part of the chicane on the inside, and then on the second part (left-hander) he'd have Rossi on the inside, but he (Marc) would have gained the position. He's contradicting himself.  +He cut the track too, so I just don't get it. He just seems to have a completely different idea of what happened. If he still maintains that he gained the position before the chicane, then I can understand the anger. Because then Rossi gained an advantage, as he gained a position by cutting the track. But his premise is wrong, because he was never ahead of Rossi; RD confirmed this, MotoGP legends confirmed this, teams confirmed it - I mean. It's pretty clear from the heli shots.   There is no reason why Marquez couldn't be right in the title this year if not for his crashes.   Yeah. 20 points unnecessarily lost in Argentina (he was never going to beat Rossi with his tyres, but he could have gotten a comfortable second place). He was doing great in Mugello before his crash, and Montmeló I'm not sure - possibly a brake issue? He seemed to brake at the same time as Jorge. That's a lot of points. 20,16,20 - possibly."
motogp,3cq9d9,Myrelin,2,Fri Jul 10 10:09:05 2015 UTC,"I think people ultimately forget that Marquez is still very young. He probably had a red mist version of his events in his head (which is very understandable at the time) and has since been just trying to back it up with actual evidence and slowly twisting his story to seem more 'reasonable'. I suspect he and Rossi don't have a lot of love lost right now,  I mean its all well and good for Marquez to be a good sport when he has the best bike and is winning but I think he's starting to look a bit more human this year.   Yeah. 20 points unnecessarily lost in Argentina (he was never going to beat Rossi with his tyres, but he could have gotten a comfortable second place). He was doing great in Mugello before his crash, and Montmeló I'm not sure - possibly a brake issue? He seemed to brake at the same time as Jorge. That's a lot of points. 20,16,20 - possibly.   Yeah, easily. I don't think he'd be ahead of Lorenzo and Rossi. But he'd still be within striking distance, maybe 25-35 points back. That story can change very quickly. But now he's effectively out of it. I can't imagine a situation he wins from here."
motogp,3cq9d9,oh84s,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:30:07 2015 UTC,"Marquez isn't pissed about Rossi maintaining position. Marquez is pissed about (what he thinks) is being baited by Rossi for Rossi's prepared corner cutting move. That's why he is full of this passive aggressiveness.   I don't dare decide what the truth is, but I don't doubt it's possible that what Suppo could be true. Unfortunately for Marc, there's no way to look in Rossi's head. Bit expect Marquez to suddenly lose speed in the last lap (which rossi did), and to bait a contact, and then cut a corner himself."
motogp,3cq9d9,JohnnieDarko,2,Fri Jul 10 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"As much as I think Marc's move was not ideal I'm glad he did it and it's the right thing to do as a racer trying to beat the opponent. It was his last shot. This is why we love racing. I'm glad Rossi responded the way he did, that he won and that Mike Webb made the right call, but I'm glad we got a great race with a 2 week conversation to follow it."
motogp,3cq9d9,mavam,3,Fri Jul 10 02:20:06 2015 UTC,Completely agree and I'm even more glad that neither of them DNF on that last corner.
motogp,3cq9d9,adobeamd,2,Fri Jul 10 02:23:47 2015 UTC,"But if there was no chicane for Rossi - or any rider - to cut across, and instead end up in the gravel, would we feel the same way?  Do we want DTM-style racing?  Riders injuring other riders through aggressive block passes?"
motogp,3cq9d9,motorboatnowork,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:26:36 2015 UTC,"That's how I feel.  I understand why folks love it, but what if Rossi didn't finish?  He'd have lost the championship lead."

motogp,3csodg,JohnnieDarko,3,Fri Jul 10 15:40:23 2015 UTC,I'm a paramedic at cota so I can offer some insight.   These guys are pretty good and they know how to fall. Most of the time they are fine. When a rider crashed race control will wait a second to see if the rider gets up. If they don't they will dispatch a medical foot team (2 paramedics) to run to their side and place them on the strecher. Meanwhile a car with a local and a DORNA Dr and an ambulance will drive on the ring road. The foot team will place the rider in the ambulance and the Dr's will assess. The rider is then transported to the med center.  If the rider falls and get up on their own they will usually just get a ride back to their garage or team room and meet with ther personal physio or Dr.  DORNA does have a medical team that travels with them made up of Dr's physio and massage therapist that have an area at the med center. The riders will use this area often during the race weekend.

motogp,3cokic,millenix13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:15:15 2015 UTC,"Simply put, I think that it was all Suppo's way of saying that Rossi should've backed off after the contact (thus possibly allowing Marquez the win).

Turn in the corner and crash one or both. Literally, there was no ""safer"" way around that corner. Regarding Marquez line after the contact Rossi would have gone through the gravel no matter what he did.  It is okay to complain after a race and claim something.

What he doesn't see, as already said by many others, is that 1) Marquez did the same thing two years ago at the Corkscrew, but on the second or third lap and 2) even Marquez went too wide on the firt corner, going on the grass in the second. How could Valentino stay on track? Rossi did think about what Marc could've done, but he certainly didn't plan to cut on the gravel."

Senna was ahead in points and the only driver even close to him was Prost, so basically as long as Prost didn't finish that race, Senna would win the drivers' championship. Also, Senna was really irritated that pole position was on what he felt was the wrong side for that particular track, and probably felt like proving a point about that as well.  Also, there was some controversy the previous year at Suzuka, when Prost crashed into Senna going into a chicane. Vengeance, perhaps."
motogp,3cketr,mrflippant,21,Thu Jul 9 22:28:19 2015 UTC,"Seriously Livio, you're above this shit. I know he has to take Marquez' side so that Marquez feels his team are behind him, but Suppo said to journalists immediately after the race that it was obviously a racing incident and he saw nothing wrong with it. That he is still complaining about it (despite it being obvious that he knows he's wrong) speaks volumes about the environment in the team around Marquez.   ""He wasn't hit strongly, it was just a contact, so Valentino didn't get the sort of blow that pushes you off track""   When the guy hitting you goes off the track himself, the guy hit has two options; crash, or go off the track. But he knows that, he's obviously just parrotting the Marquez party line."
motogp,3cketr,ross_rossifumi,13,Wed Jul 8 17:14:41 2015 UTC,"I know he has to take Marquez' side so that Marquez feels his team are behind him, but Suppo said to journalists immediately after the race that it was obviously a racing incident and he saw nothing wrong with it.   This bothers me though. Contrast this with Lin Jarvis in Jerez 2013; he didn't bash or accuse Marc. He stated that it was a hard move, and that Lorenzo left the door open.   Then look at Meregalli after Assen - he admitted he was unsure about the incident, until he saw the heli recording. After which he said that ruling it a racing incident was fair.   Suppo doesn't need to make all these statements, especially following some of his post race comments, as you said.  Looks like this'll be the new Laguna Seca, which he'll love to bring up over the next couple of years. Only problem is, this was a clear-cut case.   He also conveniently fails to address that Marc did also leave the track.   It wouldn't surprise me in the least to find out Valentino thought about all his options before the race (especially having witnessed plenty of incidents at that chicane over the past 20 years). But to suggest that a rider purposefully wanted to go through gravel on a road bike seems ridiculous to me."
motogp,3cketr,Hvse,8,Wed Jul 8 17:37:46 2015 UTC,Rossi is a master of racecraft and really has been around these tracks for decades now. I would be surprised if he hadn't considered the possibility of picking the bike up and smoking it through the gravel given a situation like what occurred with Marquez. He had the racing line and was bumped off. Instead of crashing and losing points like might have otherwise happened given the racing incident - he continued to secure points.   Suppo then goes on the complain about Laguna 08 - complaining that Casey deserved the win because his laps were faster. MotoGP is not a time trial. Being faster does not mean a win is owed if a rider doesn't have the racecraft to make a pass and stay ahead. That's just racing as long as the stewards deem no rules have been broken.   Silly PR shenanigans. Nothing more to see here.
motogp,3cketr,ross_rossifumi,10,Wed Jul 8 19:31:39 2015 UTC,"I always have to laugh at those who say Casey deserved the win because he was faster at Laguna - he was in the practise sessions, but he wasn't in the race.  Burgess has said that they were confident after the warm-up that they were just as fast as Stoner, and that they then deliberately didn't tell anyone so that Stoner didn't expect a race, and was therefore massively put on the back foot in the race.  Everyone likes to go on about Rossi's mind games, but a lot of it was Burgess - he is a crafty guy, always with a cheeky grin. Rossi needed the change, but shit I miss Burgess."

motogp,3cketr,shikitohno,4,Wed Jul 8 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"His loyalties don't need to be with Rossi. He just needs to not blow up what otherwise was a clear-cut last corner attempt that didn't work out (and where luckily both riders stayed on), with both riders taking a trip off track.  There's no need for drama, just because Marc didn't get the win. And let's not forget Laguna Seca 2013 - Rossi didn't leave Marc enough room on the inside, so he cut the corner. There was no contact. There was also no drama after the race (certainly no allegations of an unfair win), just two riders having a laugh.  The only way what Suppo said would have made sense would have been if Marc had gained the position before the contact. Because then yes Rossi would have gained a position by cutting the chicane and going on to win. In that case however RD would have gotten involved."
motogp,3cketr,Deacon46,3,Wed Jul 8 21:53:42 2015 UTC,"Why, Honda, why? Nobody wants off-track Drama. Leave it for the race. I thought both VR and MM had made a good job of dismissing the whole situation at the press conference, but Honda is now coming out with this comments, trying to create some feud between MM and VR? Are we so used to the doctor battling his nemesis that we need to make a nemesis out of MM? He's a fantastic rider chasing the championship, and most of the issues he ran into are Honda's fault. So maybe Honda should STFU and focus on fixing their damn bike instead of making stupid unsportsmanlike comments such as this one."

Depending on who you're quoting he either   Is Valentino fucking Rossi and could could have corrected had he wanted to.

Is a victim of one of the most precise racers on the planet who came in too hot on a corner and just barely pulled through thanks to a wide gravel run off.

motogp,3cketr,Ehralur,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:58:37 2015 UTC,"Sheesh, it's one thing to say Rossi is a cunning rider, but to say that's why he won is just silly. He was faster. Just accept this."
motogp,3cketr,SoftwareMaven,-2,Wed Jul 8 16:49:25 2015 UTC,"I don't understand these hostile comments. I thought Suppo wasn't really negative about Rossi at all. I think what he said makes sense and Rossi may have anticipated what happened. Other than that he was just praising Rossi, not saying much negative about him at all."
motogp,3cketr,Ehralur,3,Wed Jul 8 20:37:35 2015 UTC,"""Valentino was a champion of guile by straightening the bike as soon as he saw Marc getting close. ""He wasn't hit strongly, it was just a contact, so Valentino didn't get the sort of blow that pushes you off track. ""He went off track himself.""   This is not praising him, nor saying that Rossi thought of the possibility of a last-corner clash, and assessed his options (it would be surprising if that wasn't the case, given his experience at the track).   He's actually suggesting that the contact - that had Marc running off track too - was small, and that Rossi basically backed out of the battle and gased it across the gravel to win. Not because the contact pushed him wide, but to ensure he would win.  It's a very polite way of accusing someone of cheating. And I don't think he's right. Yes it's likely Rossi anticipated the scenario, because it's Assen and because it's Marc. Which is why he had the presence of mind to stand the bike up before (not if) he hit the gravel. But that's not the same as suggesting he just decided to do a bit of dirt biking, without needing to. Especially considering Marc ran off track too. I don't understand how Valentino was then supposed to be able to make that corner."
motogp,3cjjn5,Dan27,7,Wed Jul 8 12:13:01 2015 UTC,This really isn't a surprise. He clearly didn't want to be there and was forced into the ride by Aprilia. I feel he'll go back to WSBK as there's stories over there that Sylvan isn't happy on the Honda and could be on his way out.   Looks like Michael Laverty will be riding the bike in Germany.
motogp,3cjjn5,SirSmudge,6,Wed Jul 8 12:38:43 2015 UTC,I don't understand why Guintoli decided to move to Honda when it was clear Honda has an outdated package.. Was he promised the new CBR and it got delayed? That's the only reason I can think of..

motogp,3cjjn5,kruzztee,8,Wed Jul 8 12:37:40 2015 UTC,"To be totally fair to him though his time at Yamaha the bike wasn't the competitive big bang version that Rossi rode to victory in 2004.  In 2005 he came 2nd in the championship, in a year Rossi dominated, that wasn't with the Honda Factory team but actually with this same Aprilia team he is with now. That year was the last time a non factory team had any real success.  Ducati's win in the Championship came prior to Marco joining not after.  He just never seemed to be in the right position at the right time to get the best bike in the best team."
motogp,3cjjn5,montyzac,8,Wed Jul 8 15:30:17 2015 UTC,He just never seemed to be in the right position at the right time to get the best bike in the best team.   Crutchlow is kinda in the same position...
motogp,3cjjn5,Disgruntled__Goat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:25:44 2015 UTC,"Well he's only been on one factory team, Ducati and they've struggled for some time. If you're not on a factory backed Honda or Yamaha, at this moment, you don't have much chance of race wins given that the 4 riders on those bikes win nearly every single race."
motogp,3cjjn5,KICKERMAN360,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:33:23 2015 UTC,"Well he's only been on one factory team, Ducati and they've struggled for some time.   That was my point. He left Ducati for Honda and this year Ducati are doing much better and Honda not so well."
motogp,3cjjn5,Disgruntled__Goat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:09:43 2015 UTC,"How can you say that? You're comparing a factory Ducati to a satellite Honda. The Honda bike is better than the Ducati, otherwise the Ducati riders wouldn't fade near the end."
motogp,3cjjn5,KICKERMAN360,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:17:49 2015 UTC,Crutchlow's bike is pretty damn close to the factory bikes. But just look at this year's race results. Honda have struggled (although they are starting to come good now) while Ducati are having their best season for years. They are ahead in the manufacturers standings.
motogp,3cjjn5,Disgruntled__Goat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:13:13 2015 UTC,Most of Honda's lack of success this year is due to Pedrosa sitting out races and Marquez not quite gelling with the new chassis. So the points don't really reflect the speed of the bike too well.
motogp,3cjjn5,KICKERMAN360,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:36:00 2015 UTC,"Being on a factory team is not necessarily a recipe for success. Pedrosa has been on a factory team for ages and his performance was always subpar. Dovizioso was in both Honda and Ducati and his performance was always subpar. Ben Spies was in the Yamaha team and his performance was always subpar. And the list goes on...  Motogp riders are the best of the best. But they are not all ""true champions"", and I'm sorry but Melandri, Cruthchlow, Dovizioso, etc.. will not win a motogp championship no matter the motorcycle."
motogp,3cjjn5,fmmfonseca,7,Wed Jul 8 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"I think you're being unfair on Dani. For starters, Pedrosa is arguably the best rider never to win the World Championship and throughout his career has competed with Rossi, Stoner, Lorenzo and Marquez. Yes, Hayden, Stoner and Marquez (twice) have won the Championship on the same bike but his performance with Honda has been anything but sub-par, even if the last 18 months have been very difficult for him. Dani is very much an ""alien"" and had things gone differently in 2012 or 2013 or maybe even 2011 (Le Mans) then he'd be a worthy Champion."
motogp,3cjjn5,W50,2,Wed Jul 8 17:42:50 2015 UTC,Lets not forget all the injuries.  Maybe he isn't as good at elbow to elbow but I wouldn't call him subpar.  He has many wins under his belt.
motogp,3cjjn5,motorboatnowork,0,Wed Jul 8 18:44:51 2015 UTC,"I beg to disagree, Danny is a hell of a rider, but he's not a ""champion"". You can downvote me at will :) In ten, yes, TEN years as an factory Honda rider, he was only a championship contender in 2012! And in the same ten years he seldom showed champion character while on the track.. People always say IF, IF, IF, but that's exactly the point. What happened, happened and could not have happened any other way. I mean, any of us could theoretically be a motogp champion, if..."
motogp,3cjjn5,fmmfonseca,3,Wed Jul 8 20:05:47 2015 UTC,"Why do you say only 2012?   In the premier class he has 3 2nd place finishes and 3 3rd places in the championship, you don't get a 2nd or 3rd in the championship without being a contender, top placed Honda rider in 5 of his seasons also.   Not particularly a big fan of Danni, but not sure who I would have ever been replacing him with if I was Honda to be honest, even now I don't see anyone who could easily slip into his little shoes."
motogp,3cjjn5,montyzac,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:49:39 2015 UTC,"He did finish 2nd place 3 times, but.. in 2007 he was 125 points behind.. in 2010 he was 138 points behind... only in 2012 he was a real contender, 18 points behind. Again, don't get me wrong, he's a great pilot, but he lacks that little something to make him a champion."

motogp,3cjjn5,cantpee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:21:58 2015 UTC,"I'm with you man, every year I see Dani on the factory ride I see it as a guaranteed 3rd place trophy and I'm not sure why Honda keeps him around when there are plenty of other very fast riders out there, looking at you EsA, that given a factory ride with a championship team would without a doubt out perform Dani.  I hope that Alex Espagaro gets a shot on a top tier bike before he's too old, that guy could put a riding lawnmower on pole but can't keep up in the race due to his ride, not his talent."
motogp,3cjjn5,VR46,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:04:06 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna argue that Honda keeps him there because he's the perfect rider number 2. He's quiet and keeps good relationships with everyone, he's no drama queen on or off the track, and he's good enough to push the rider number 1 to perform, but not good enough to threaten the rider number 1."
motogp,3cjjn5,fmmfonseca,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:24:01 2015 UTC,"Now that is a good argument for keeping ole DP around.  Well put.  I guess Danni has always been the Cal Naughton Jr. to Honda's WC seat (Nick, Casey, Marc)."
motogp,3cjjn5,VR46,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:13:08 2015 UTC,"Ducati's win in the Championship came prior to Marco joining not after.   Melandri joined in 2008, the year after Stoner took the title.

motogp,3cjjn5,montyzac,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:36:24 2015 UTC,Yeah for some strange reason most of the BSB races this year clash with WSBK instead of MotoGP (the BSB and WSBK always used to try and avoid conflicting).
motogp,3cjjn5,Disgruntled__Goat,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:27:25 2015 UTC,I think these days because of the differences in rules it's not easy to wildcard in wsbk like it used to be so they don't care about a clash.   BSB wildcard rides were always great entertainment. Particularly when they won!

Although the Gresini Aprilia team is a factory effort, the subsidy from Dorna is very welcome. At the moment, Melandri and Aprilia are at loggerheads over the future. Neither one wishes to continue for the rest of the season, but Melandri will not leave without being paid, and Aprilia are disinclined to pay for such a gross underperformance. If this continues, however, it may be worth their while to pay for Melandri to leave. The Italian is rumored to be on a salary well north of €1 million a season, and he is keen to see that money. The amount of money Gresini Aprilia would be missing out on for 2016 if Melandri (or his replacement) is around €1.5 million, so it may prove to be more costly to keep Melandri at 25th in the rider ranking than to replace him with someone capable of finishing nearer to his teammate, Alvaro Bautista, and ahead of a few other riders."

That said, most of the time they're also decelerating into or accelerating into the corner which will create some additional Gs in the forward or aft direction.  It's pretty tough to compare the physical stresses of F1 and MotoGP... very different activities.  But from my own personal club racing experience, legs, neck, abdomen and (to a certain extent) arms take the load while braking, cornering and accelerating.    Getting the bike turned also takes a lot of effort.  Depending on how stable the bike it and how quickly you need to change your lean angle, a lot of handlebar pressure can be required in order to countersteer in the desired direction... lotta chest, shoulders & tricepts strength needed for that.    Racing a motorcycle is definitely a full body workout.  EDIT:  Just found this which definitively supports my hypothesis, despite all the downvotes this has gotten.  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/92/Bike_lean_angle_vs_forward_speed.PNG (from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_and_motorcycle_dynamics)  What that graph is saying is that to ride around in a circle with a 40 foot radius at 47mph you'd need about 60 degrees of lean.  This would result in about 1.73 LATERAL G's.  If you then take into account the vertical 1G of gravity then the rider experiences a total of 2G's.

motogp,3c4axw,OreoGaborio,8,Sat Jul 4 17:37:42 2015 UTC,"In theory, cornering Gs should be comparable to the Gs that a pilot experiences at a the same bank angle in a turn while maintaining level flight.  http://www.rainierflightservice.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/load-factor-chart.gif  According to that chart, 60 degrees of lean is about 2Gs if you're maintaining constant speed...    This is not correct at all. The reason you can calculate that for any aircraft based on level flight and constant speed is because the action of turning the aircraft comes from moving through the air. The aircraft generates X amount of lift, and banking left or right is what causes the aircraft to change heading. The tightness of the circle is determined by how much ""lift"" the aircraft can produce.  Since both an F15 and a A380 use their wings for lift, at 250knots, level flight, and 15 degrees bank they'll make the exact same G's and turning radius.   Motorcycles don't get their turning forces from the air, they get it from traction on the ground. Changes in geometry can vastly alter the handling characteristics of a bike. A Honda grom will turn much differently than a bigass chopper even if you lean them the same amount(say, 10 degrees on both bikes).  Think about if you roll a penny on it's side, and then a man hole cover on it's side. Which will produce the tighter turning radius before falling over?   That said, those bridgestones are likely doing a lot of work, but without any kind of downforce the G load is likely to be not much more than 1G or so. You're average street tire and track rider can hit 1G lateral forces and you know the bridgestones are stickier than that."
motogp,3c4axw,Gundamnitpete,2,Sat Jul 4 17:56:39 2015 UTC,"The brakes provide over 1g of deceleration (those Bridgestone tires and carbon/carbon brakes are something), but wind resistance as riders pop up will have an impact, too. Taken together, they are in the 1.5g range. This forum post has some interesting posts on the topic.  There's a reason arm pump has been such an issue the last few seasons."
motogp,3c4axw,SoftwareMaven,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:56:08 2015 UTC,"I agree. This is Physics 101 (literally).. Unless the riders are accelerating (or decelerating), then the max +g they would experience is 2/root3 , assuming the max bank angle is 60degrees. Also, this would increase (or decrease) if they are riding through a trough (or a crest)."
motogp,3c4axw,the-minister,-4,Sat Jul 4 19:04:11 2015 UTC,"I'll admit my theory is purely hypothetical, but it IS based on my reasonable, but fairly basic knowledge of motorcycle dynamics (been racing for a decade), aerodynamics (I have BS in aviation) and physics (classes required as part of my degree).  G's are a function of centripetal force.  And since velocity and lean angle are what determine the radius of a turn in on a motorcycles and velocity and bank angle are what determine the radius of a turn in an aircraft, I'm thinking that the Gs created by that turn probably pretty similar between the two.  They may not be exactly the same, but I bet they're at least fairly close.  While I can't see youtube behind my work's firewall, if that 1G lateral force is only lateral then total G's is 1.41 since you need to add the 1G vertical force generated by gravity itself."
motogp,3c4axw,OreoGaborio,2,Sat Jul 4 18:21:47 2015 UTC,"You are complicating the problem unnecessarily, and confusing aerodynamics with traction.  Aircraft use aerodynamic forces (lift) to change direction. Motorcycles use the friction force.   The limit of lift (max lift resulting in max g's) is based upon a whole host of factors which I won't get into here, but suffice to say that it allows turning at an extremely high rate. Red Bull Air Racers have to be limited to 12Gs for pilot safety, but can easily exceed this number. As a result, aerobatic aircraft can pull G's well beyond the body's ability to withstand them.  Unlike F1 cars, motorcycles do not have any noticeable aerodynamic lift force, and thus rely solely on the  friction force for turning. The only way they can increase their friction force beyond the limit of the tires (~1G) is via banking.   In conclusion: max g's on a bike are limited by tires, which are approx 1g without banking."

motogp,3c4axw,Twitchy_throttle,0,Sun Jul 5 10:13:45 2015 UTC,"Actually I'm trying to simplify it...  Aerodynamics vs traction, while relevant, is unnecessarily over-complicating it.  So lets simplify it further.  G's in a normal, level turn isn't a question of aerodynamics and traction, it's a question of speed and radius of the curve.  That's what generates lateral G forces (although it should be noted that I'm talking about TOTAL G's here, which factors in gravity itself).  The big question that I'm asking here, is this:  If an airplane and a motorcycle both going the same speed with the same amount of lean/bank (say about 50-60 degrees) will they have a similar turning radius?  THAT I'm not certain of, but I'd be willing to bet that they're at least fairly close, which would mean that a bike w/ a 45* angle of lean would generate roughly the same total Gs as an aircraft at a 45* angle of bank.  PS - As someone who's gone through a full semester of aerobatic training, I'm pretty well aware of what aerobatic aircraft are capable of, but Red bull air race type aerobatic aircraft shouldn't even be brought up in this discussion... you're talking about airplanes that regularly see knife-edge and inverted flight and use massive amount of elevator to tighten up the turns... That's not even CLOSE to what I'm trying to explore, here.  I'm talking normal aircraft making standard, level turns with bank angles up to around 50-60 degrees.   In conclusion: max g's on a bike are limited by tires, which are approx 1g without banking.   You and I are experiencing 1G right now.... I'm talking about TOTAL g's, not just LATERAL g's.

motogp,3c4axw,OreoGaborio,0,Sun Jul 5 10:44:33 2015 UTC,"Actually if the grom and chopper are at the same speed then they will have the same turning radius at the same lean angle. This has to be true since the lean angle is there to balance out the roll torque while cornering. Mass cancels out of the equation so for any given speed and turning radius there is a set lean angle. And before you start with body position crap, the lean angle is described as the angle between the plane of the contact patch and the center of gravity of the combined bike and rider.   Another interesting note, lean angle sensors are only lateral accelerometers that extrapolate the lean angle from how much lateral acceleration there is."

The human body is geared towards dealing with forces 'head to toes' so in a number of instances the same accelerative forces experienced by a motorcycle rider are not as taxing as that for a car driver. The neck of a rider through corners is largely pointing at a similar direction to the direction of the application of the force vs in F1 where it is at pretty much 90 degrees to it. Of course the F1 cars corner much harder due to their downforce levels."

The main goal for the riders in their physical training is building muscle endurance without gaining bulk and also achieving outstanding cardiovascular fitness. Alex Hofmann once told me that because of the sheer adrenalin his heart rate would be up to around 180bpm on the grid, and that was before the race even started! The main way they prepare for this is cycling - I would say that forms the basis for all of their training, as well as low-weight, high-rep weights, abdominal training etc. In the winter some of them mix it up with things like cross-country skiing, whilst guys like Jorge Lorenzo are also embracing new low-intensity activities such as yoga and pilates, which also allow them to train when injured""  http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/motorbikes/8651145.stm  Now that I think about I'm pretty sure it was Ben Spies not Crutchlow on the heart monitor and it was at the start of the race so it was probably just adrenaline"

Thing is, resting heart rate changes a lot with physical condition and even your size. Smaller people have higher resting heart rates, larger people have lower. Being in shape dramatically reduces your heartrate, as the heart is a muscle and can get stronger.  Remember Rossi is not one of the 5'2"" jockey style riders, he's 6'.

A bit more than that, and you are raising the back too much, and will end in a crash. Compare F1 braking distances (just 20 - 80 m before a corner) to MotoGP braking (sometimes they are on their brakes as far as 300 meters before the corner), so, considering the speeds are almost the same (yeah, on some circuits F1 is faster, on others MotoGP takes the top speed, but they're generally between 300 and 350), you have a larger braking distance on MotoGP, so you'll never see as many Gs as in F1. Mostly because F1 cars are aerodynamically insane, with a shitload of control surfaces, while control surfaces are entirely banned in MotoGP (and would not be that effective anyway) on a motorcycle).

Let me put it in other terms: I Just added the points summed this Championship by every rider in the lower half of the table. Each of their scores added together is 150, that is, not enough to reach second place. If HALF the riders (well, technically more than half, 13 out of 25) put their scores together, they would only reach 3rd place this championship.   That isn't just a disparity, it's a ridiculous disparity. By whatever logic keeps them in MotoGP, we could also join Moto2 and Moto3 with MotoGP and let them all race together. Now, the thing is, this are not bad riders, and they don't have bad machines. Their times would actually be fairly competitive in WSBK. So, why not give them their own category? Qualifying is already broken up into two groups, and we're already talking about them as if they were on a different race (nobody measures Open riders against Factory riders), and it's a pretty big deal to finish first in the open category ... but they never see a Podium, or a price, or get camera time, they effectively never win. So, let's give them their own category. Same rules, same riders, same machines. It wouldn't increase race costs in any significant matter. In fact, Moto2 and Moto3 wouldn't be profitable on their own, not with the current infrastructure, just as WSBK is barely profitable right now. But as part of MotoGP, it is. It's were the factories go to hunt for talent, it's a staging area. You already have the cameras, the media coverage, the marshals, the track, the people. You don't even have to change anything about FP or Q, so all the resources they would be allocating is some time for the race. Say, 40 minutes race plus another 20 before and after for organization. While you already have everything laid out, Adding an hour and change to a 3 day event costs literally nothing, and it would actually increase profits, specially in terms of broadcasting royalties (TV Channels think in terms of viewers x air time, because that's how ads pay off).   It would allow better coverage of this fantastic 25 riders we watch every 2 weeks, increase profits, and boost morale for 13 of them. And we get 33% more MotoGP! It's a win-win-win."

motogp,3c1c4e,Armored_Ape,3,Sat Jul 4 22:01:09 2015 UTC,I've not watched the footage back for obvious reasons but from what I can remember the back started to come around as he opened the throttle out of the corner. As it came around he began pointing across the track and was still hanging off the bike. He was then struck by another rider (Edwards?) and I think then by Rossi. As soon I saw his helmet was off I knew what the outcome would be.

motogp,3c08h5,cantpee,24,Fri Jul 3 16:16:52 2015 UTC,"Honda - No, because no matter what, Honda will always shortchange you on the kit or personnel. Too many politics with Honda even down to what riders I get to choose.   Yamaha - Yes, they are overall pretty supportive and give much closer to factory spec and even some technical support. Seem way easier to work with. However I must be careful not to always be second string to Tech 3.   Ducati - Conditional, I must have Italian riders on my team to guarantee better support from Bologna  Aprilia - Yes, a big gamble, but I think they have something to prove and with their bike being so new and needing so much data, very good chance their kit is as close as you can get with the factory guys. Plus probably big time support from factory to help develop the package. Good chance here to develop a long lasting relationship and become their ""Tech 3/Pramac"" team.  Suzuki - No, I am still slightly skeptical on their long term commitments. Suzuki has always been budget, they are doing great this year but HQ can always change their minds. Need to wait.  KTM - Hell no, unless factory subsidizes me for almost free. It would almost need to be a Gresini/Aprilia like partnership."

motogp,3c08h5,robotburrito,14,Fri Jul 3 20:18:38 2015 UTC,"I see everyone dismissing KTM, but I would go with them, if I could pull this off:   Bajaj is growing, and they pretty much own a huge relatively untapped market. They already own 47% of KTM, they are manufacturing for them, and they want more. India has a brand new beautiful circuit, that has already successfully hosted F1. Dorna said they might add two new locations. KTM gets a team next season, Bajaj owns almost half of KTM, but Bajaj itself has no MotoGP representation. Bam! Get a satellite team with at least one Indian rider and get Bajaj to sponsor you. You have 1.2 billion potential fans, a sponsor with manufacturing capabilities, and an almost-controlling interest in your provider. Bajaj has a 100% support from the Indian government for whatever they want to do. Team up with Bajaj and India to lobby Dorna to get a MotoGP going on in Buddh.   Cons:   A very new manufacturer with zero MotoGP experience   Pros:    KTM could do great, seeing what KTM has done in Moto3 If you can get Bajaj onboard, you'll get more funding than any other satellite team.  Unlike most other Satellite teams, you get a shitload of loyal fans that have their very own circuit You have a pretty much 100% guarantee that your provider will give you top notch tech, unlike every other satellite team.    It might not win you races in the beginning, but will pay off in a few years.   BTW: I'm not from India, but I've followed what Bajaj has been manufacturing for a while, and I've rode a few of their machines, and they are the absolute best I've seen in the sub 300cc range."
motogp,3c08h5,gnualmafuerte,5,Fri Jul 3 21:15:01 2015 UTC,"Dude that is a great post. Yes.  Hell just take the KTM and re-name it the Bajaj. That was pretty much all Mahindra did in Moto3, at least at first. And it's been done by Derbi, Gilera, more recently Husqvarna.   I could see that being the highest attended GP round of the season."
motogp,3c08h5,NotNotLitotes,3,Fri Jul 3 23:32:50 2015 UTC,"Right? Sounds like it might actually work. Now I really want somebody to do it! Specially since countries that don't usually get much attention from international shows tend to fill up stadiums real quickly when they do!   I'm from Argentina. The Wall live in Buenos Aires broke all record, with 9 consecutive shows, each with over 50k people, all of them entirely sold out. More people went to see the show than in the states, and we only have 10% of the population the US has. Round 3 this year got 130.000 fans on that track (And the city where it happened is a very small town, meaning most of them traveled at the very least 500km to see the GP.   The same could happen in India, and considering there are 1.2 billion people there, and motorcycles (specially Bajaj) are insanely popular, it could be a very profitable location for Dorna."

They have a huge pool of resources, experience from multiple fields (including a huge road racing department in e.g. Red Bull Rookies, Moto3) and are probably bringing their biggest sponsor (Red Bull). They know how to build performance bikes, their goal is to build performance bikes, not scooters or cheap transportation, and they know how to run a team around a performance bike. At this stage, it's just silly to count out KTM when they have so many more prototype racers around the world than Suzuki or Ducati and probably a lot more money to spend."

They've done fantastic in moto3 but single cyl 250s are kinda their thing. It's a major major ask to get them to a competitive place in GP. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy they're joining, but I think the only reason they are is that dorna is supplying the electronics, which they currently don't seem to have. I hope they do well but I'll be impressed if the get more than 10 points their rookie season."

Interesting when you get into the detail of 2014 vs this year, the on form Ducati and Suzuki bikes have made it hard for the customer Honda bikes to be scoring points.   So on the face of it someone like redding hasn't improved, yet actually he has just to be the same points as 2014.   Sure the next 2 years will only get tougher."

motogp,3bzaq7,Rees68,10,Fri Jul 3 10:44:19 2015 UTC,He's on second rate equipment. He's been on second rate equipment his entire career.
motogp,3bzaq7,500GP,6,Fri Jul 3 20:55:03 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying in that his career has been somewhat lackluster. He hasn't had a truly competitive bike in MotoGP yet, honestly what he did last year was remarkable. He placed 7th in the championship on an open bike ahead of several satellite/factory riders like Smith, Bautista, Bradl, Crutchlow, et al. That's no small feat. That sort of riding is why he's on a factory bike, even though it's a slow start for Suzuki. Hopefully he and Suz stick together for a couple years to see what he and the bike can do. So far, nothing amazing, but he's finished in the top 10, mostly, when he's finished so far this season."
motogp,3bzaq7,mavam,2,Fri Jul 3 13:22:18 2015 UTC,"something to keep in mind when you are rating his open-class-results: he had a very competitive package. they had a good working ecu with the soft rear tyre being a full step softer than this year. the ""open-honda"" wasnt the factory bike from the last season. it was a production racer. the grid was missing fast ducatis and the suzis. iam not saying he didnt achieve a really good result overall bit it wasnt as hard as this year. even look at the gaps in laptimes from last year compared to today."
motogp,3bzaq7,DeathMagnet1C,6,Fri Jul 3 14:15:04 2015 UTC,He beat a factory satellite Yamaha rider and two factory satellite Hondas. That's impressive.
motogp,3bzaq7,mavam,-1,Fri Jul 3 14:24:03 2015 UTC,"He beat the pants off his teammate (sorry Colin) on the Open Yamaha, and the kid was consistently top of the CRT class on the ART bike. He's not consistent and I get the impression that he's rather immature, but I don't think anyone can deny that he is fast. He does have potential -- I just hope he can focus his energies a little better."
motogp,3bzaq7,cantpee,5,Fri Jul 3 14:59:48 2015 UTC,It will be tough for Maverick to beat him. I think that Aleix has been underrated his entire career. He totally dominated all of his open teammates who had more experience and rostrums.
motogp,3bzaq7,robotburrito,3,Fri Jul 3 20:23:18 2015 UTC,Ignoring the fact that he was the highest ranked CRT the two years prior on an ART of all things.  There were a few races he even fought for podiums for good portions of the race
motogp,3bzaq7,Sticky_Neonate,2,Fri Jul 3 14:08:59 2015 UTC,"What ever Aleix has must work for the Suzuki team.   Its not all about finishing positions, that's all well and good but if your rider cant give proper detailed feedback on what is going on underneath him and work well with the engineers then finishing 5th over 9th for a race is not worth it.  Looking at the riders available for 2015, not sure who else I would put in that seat that had experience of a current Motogp bike and tyres who also had ran at the sharp end.   His experience of what he rode in 2014 must have been an excellent bench mark for Suzuki."
motogp,3bzaq7,montyzac,4,Fri Jul 3 16:10:41 2015 UTC,Do you know how many riders are on the grid that have never finished on top of the rostrum.  Also the suziki is severerly lacking in the engine department so for Aleix and Vinales to finish where they are they have to outride everyone in the corners only to lose it on the straights.   This is also a development year for Suzuki and the work he has done with that bike is outstanding and shows the bikes true potential.   Take a look here http://www.motogp.com/en/Results+Statistics/2014/NED/MotoGP/World+Standing  and see all the people he placed ahead of on a forward racing yamaha which is worse than all the satellite bikes on the grid and tell me the kid doesn't deserve a ride.

At the same time it's a bit strange to me that a guy who has only stood on the rostrum twice in his career has a factory ride.  I think Vinales undoubtedly has the greater potential of the two, but I wonder whether Aleix could consistently challenge for rostrums if the Suzuki had a bit more power to it."

He hasn't really shown the improvement I was hoping/expecting. It will be interesting to see what the Suzuki's can do in the race at Germany next as its not a top speed heavy track.
motogp,3bzaq7,Imeatbag,2,Fri Jul 3 12:02:22 2015 UTC,"Germany really will show whether he deserves to be on the bike or not. It's a track that will play to the qualities of his bike for sure. If he shows up with a good set up and qualifies well like he did last race he should be fighting for a top five finishing position in Germany. Last race was really disappointing, he got swamped by the crowd."
motogp,3bzaq7,servenToGo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:19:51 2015 UTC,"Okay, if you want to get someone who won a MotoGP race in the past, you will have to prepare an excellent ride and a lot of money. There are very few riders that won a race and still are competitive. In the lower classes he was never a number one rider in a number one team. But he fought against some factory bikes last year and beat them at times, so he is quite good. Vinales has great potential, it is not like Maverick beating him means Aleix is not competitive, it'll just take a while for Suzuki to be top and Aleix will  be there then, I believe."
motogp,3bzaq7,Jeff505,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:08:46 2015 UTC,"Well I am pretty biased because he's been making the Suzuki look good, but honestly he's the fastest guy that was available. Nobody else was putting open bikes in the places he was. He also showed he can provide feedback that makes a bike faster - not many people can do that."
motogp,3bzaq7,SirSmudge,0,Fri Jul 3 16:33:48 2015 UTC,I think sometimes with Aleix he takes the brain out before leaving the pits as I think there have been a couple of times this season were his own hot headedness as caused him to take a couple of riders out. Pols the same.  Could we be saying the same about Pol a couple seasons down the line?
motogp,3bzaq7,buhuhilus,0,Fri Jul 3 17:49:59 2015 UTC,"I second that. He has a temper. But he is fast and very eager to win so, given the right bike, he might have a chance. Although history is full of great riders that could not make it, a bit of luck never hurt anyone."

motogp,3by9tz,SirSmudge,3,Fri Jul 3 08:53:40 2015 UTC,Yeah he had zero interest in being in MotoGP. Its like he was acting like he had a gun against his head.
motogp,3by9tz,Dan27,3,Fri Jul 3 09:10:33 2015 UTC,"Melandri never wanted to return to MotoGP. Aprilia wanted him to race in GP and when they pulled withdrew Factory support in WSBK (and he had no other available opportunities there) he very reluctantly  returned to MotoGP.    It's a difficult situation for him as he has gone from fighting for Podiums and Race Wins on a bike that won the Championship in WSBK last year to basically completing race long tests every other week in MotoGP and we know from history that he is not the most mentally strong character in Motorcycle racing, it must be very demoralising for him at the moment."

motogp,3by9tz,OnTheTerlet,4,Mon Jul 6 09:54:30 2015 UTC,Karel's dad owns Brno (or something like that). The team wouldn't exist if he stopped racing.
motogp,3by9tz,superset_08,2,Fri Jul 3 10:39:37 2015 UTC,"Weird that AB Motoracing didn't want Van Der Mark despite HRC backing, but is okay with Aoyama. Perhaps due to his relative low crash rates?    Last week, it was reported that you would make your MotoGP debut at Assen, having agreed to replace the injured Karel Abraham at the AB Motoracing team. It didn’t come to fruition. What happened? “I think there was a big misunderstanding. It was the team’s decision. It’s all about budget. HRC (Honda Racing Corporation), Honda Europe and my team agreed with me that I would ride at the weekend, but the team decided not to take any risks about crashing, so I couldn’t do anything about it.”   None the less will be good to see Aoyama back.  edit: http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2015/07/01/van-der-mark-interview-there-was-a-big-misunderstanding/179227"
motogp,3by9tz,montyzac,3,Fri Jul 3 03:50:19 2015 UTC,"Its not really that weird.   VDM can give the team zero feedback on how they have the bike set up or how to work with what they have, Aoyama's advice on the other hand will be invaluable to them.  In that quote, VDM saying HRC and Honda Europe agreed he could ride, pretty much means nothing. AB Motoracing are a customer of Honda, him having HRC agreement to ride their bike means zip. Its like me telling my mate he can drive your car."
motogp,3by9tz,SoftwareMaven,3,Fri Jul 3 12:34:51 2015 UTC,The irony is that Aoyama was not very good about bringing Dani's bike home in one piece.
motogp,3by9tz,Fatty_Tuna,6,Fri Jul 3 05:21:05 2015 UTC,To be fair one crash was because Petrucci steam rolled into him during the race!

motogp,3bsqwf,ross_rossifumi,-5,Thu Jul 2 22:07:51 2015 UTC,He hit on target the past two years and Rossi hasn't won a championship in half a decade so.....
motogp,3bsqwf,Karl_Vos,16,Thu Jul 2 07:44:50 2015 UTC,"You're missing my point... I'm not saying anyone's better than anyone else. All I mean is if you're going to make a move like that on someone like Rossi you better make sure you're all the way ahead; he's not going to back down just because there might be contact. So while it might work on a rookie who will back off because Marc bullies his way into the inside line, someone like Rossi has way too much experience to just let it slide. He knows if he's ahead then even if they do touch he's in the right and he's going to come out on top"

The bike is already transmitting a video feed, which I imagine is done over WiMAX or a similar technology, you could easily get Telemetry from there, and even be able to operate the ECU.

I learned yesterday evening that I was way too old to wreck an almost 400lb motorcycle in the desert at greater than forty miles an hour and not feel it in the morning.  I feel like I got hit by a truck, after crashing in a way that I've done countless times over the years. Oh well.    On to more important things, if you're interested in the MotoGP electronics rules, they are defined in broad strokes in the FIM rulebook (PDF Warning) beginning on page 63.  The electronics are very tightly controlled, although certain divisions have more latitude than others."

Same here, I had a crash last year at 100km/h, and I found out I'm not so young as I used to be either. To make it worst, I've been without my bike since April (I obliterated a piston not far from my town, as I was leaving for what would have been an awesome trip to Termas de Rio Hondo, for MotoGP Round 3, had to cancel the trip, and I am still waiting for parts).   As to my bad day, you might have heard a Leap second was added, and it fucked up some legacy apps on some of my servers, so I stayed up all night.   Thanks for the link, I'll take a look at it."

That sucks.  I hope you got them all up and running, and that you're able to get some rest.    Luckily, in my crash, I didn't hurt the bike one bit.  It's a DR650, and they're kind of made to throw around a little bit.  I was out playing in the desert on the way to the supermarket for butter (seriously, no joke) and put the front wheel into a rut.  That rut decided to make a sudden turn to the left, while my fat ass and 400lb bike had momentum in a straight line.  Now you can see the problem.  It ended with me skidding on my well padded ass at a decent speed.  True to its unbreakable nature, once the carb overflow drained out the bike started right up and there was nothing wrong with it.  It still took me two and a half hours to go for a fifteen minute run to the supermarket for butter."

They both ride aggressively and expect others to be aggressive, and while MM's move was a bit too much, neither of them were pissed off after the race. Just watch the press conference, it's 25 minutes of the press trying to create Drama where there is none.  Both MM and VR were trying to defuse the situation, as the journalists kept throwing more and more inflammatory questions. Nothing to see here, move along."

motogp,3br2hk,mclovin_eve_lolz,0,Fri Jul 3 03:34:28 2015 UTC,"All's well that ends well, until someone loses the front. Next time MM tries one of these passes and knocks Valentino off, there'll be hell to pay from fans and from Mike Webb.  Watch the replays again, he hit Valentino HARD. In slow motion you can see the bike buckling. When you are on the last corner of the last lap of a motogp race, there is no margin left for getting hit. The tires will lose traction 99% of the time. It's a miracle that Rossi managed to stay on.   Webb wants proper racing and has been very lenient, but MM takes it too far."
motogp,3br2hk,james-watson,-1,Sat Jul 4 22:52:18 2015 UTC,"You misunderstood me. I was the first to say that MM was way over the line, and what he did was dangerous. Only moments after the race, when everyone wasn't still convinced, and I got a load of downvotes for criticizing Marquez. This was my after-race post.   So, you can see where I stand on the issue, MM was wrong, dangerous, and did it out of spite since he couldn't have possibly gained anything by that move. And I did say in my original comments that people were playing it down because VR didn't crash, if he had (he didn't because he's the doctor, but chances were high), everyone would be singing a different tune.   Now, what I was saying is that there was no drama between MM and VR. That neither of them is a serial complainer like Stoner, and outside the initial reaction by both, things were calm between them, that VR reads MM better than anyone, and he knew he would pull some crap at some point; but VR is the GOAT and MM's idol, and VR knows that MM is going to be the next GOAT if he calms down a bit, and both also know that they have to continue racing each other, and starting a feud between them will be detrimental for both. They both respect each other, they both understand each others motives, and it's in their best interest to let it go and keep racing.   I wasn't excusing MMs behavior, I was saying it was the media trying to invent a rivalry between them that just isn't there. Even Lorenzo handled the situation perfectly, by avoiding a confrontation. Marc's behavior in the track was unsportsmanlike, but they all behaved like true gentlemen after the race."
motogp,3br2hk,gnualmafuerte,11,Sat Jul 4 23:04:04 2015 UTC,"When it comes to a battle for supremacy on track, Marquez is easily capable of winning against Rossi. In the battle off the track, I’m afraid there is only ever going to be one winner.   I would've thought Marc was the nail in the coffin for Rossi and his ability to turn his closest rivals into the villain. He's been doing it since 2000. 15 years later he's still doing it, to someone who up until recently was affectionately called the little devil of MotoGP and spiritual successor to Rossi.  But no one can truly be a successor to Rossi."

motogp,3br2hk,bravo_company,6,Wed Jul 1 21:30:06 2015 UTC,"One nameless MotoGP rider that I bumped into at breakfast on Sunday morning was in no doubt. ""Well that’s the end of that beautiful friendship then,"" he said.   Sounds like Cal Crutchlow to me.  As for Rossi vs. Marquez, I would say yes, there is no doubt the relationship has already changed. It must be very hard to have bitter feelings towards a guy you grew up idolizing; love and hate are not opposites, the passion and intensity of the feeling is still there, it just manifests itself in a different direction. I think we will see some explosive racing for the rest of the season, maybe even a Marquez comeback with a three-way battle for the championship."

Maybe, but surely he has hard feelings about Rossi as an opponent now. Maybe he ""learned something"" from Rossi, but I think it's a very blurry line to want to beat someone badly (get revenge even?), and not to start disliking them as a person.   The truth is that this incident is an advertising stunt that Dorna is milking to the fullest extent possible and i hope the two riders will not be influenced by this.   Of course they will take advantage of the hype, and why shouldn't they? It's their job to promote the sport, and sport is about competition. It's good if we have rivalry and close competition, but I do agree and hope there isn't truly bad personal blood.

Here's a quote from an interview after the race:   Marc Marquez: “You can’t imagine what I feel, I’m really happy because we return to the top. We came back fighting for the win which is the most important. I’m happy because we usually struggle here. Most importantly though, I enjoyed the bike again. There’s still some areas to improve. I was quiet and calm during the race and studied Rossi a lot, learning when I could overtake him and attack. I made a mistake with three laps to go, but I made it back, The whole race I focused on studying the last chicane perfectly, I knew where to put the bike to limit his space but I didn’t think he’d cut the corner. In the end I feel we won the race, but five points don’t really matter for me.”  “It’s important for me and the team to come back, especially in a track where we have struggled before. We enjoyed the track and the bike and with a lot to improve, especially at the end of the race. I took care of the tyres a lot and now we head to Germany. I learnt some motocross from Rossi today!”"
motogp,3br2hk,pondiki,2,Wed Jul 1 15:21:33 2015 UTC,I didn't see it that way.
motogp,3br2hk,old_po_blu_collar,2,Wed Jul 1 16:09:53 2015 UTC,"i just wonder why no one asked MM93 how he planned to make the next corner in the chicane without impacting Rossi, since   Seems to me like he was so hot coming into that final set of turns that he would have toasted the 2nd turn in the chicane because he barely made it around."
motogp,3br2hk,aDDnTN,5,Wed Jul 1 20:43:42 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, without Rossi there he would have gone off the track even more than he did in the first place; his line and entry speed were wrong for the chicane.  After the race he was still in the heat of the moment, hadn't seen the replay three or four times from multiple angles, and said some incorrect things. I don't hate the guy for that, it's racing. I just hope if he is asked about it again, he owns up to the fact that he was mistaken."
motogp,3br2hk,pondiki,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:49:14 2015 UTC,"I guess at racing speed, it all seems to be a bit different. It is an extremely competitive motorsport that brings out the aggression."
motogp,3br2hk,aDDnTN,0,Thu Jul 2 03:29:48 2015 UTC,"i just wonder why no one asked MM93 how he planned to make the next corner in the chicane without impacting Rossi   They did ask, that's the funniest part of it all: He planned to do exactly what Rossi did a corner before: Be on the outside (compared to Rossi) but ahead (so being on the inside suddenly means nothing), and close the door on him.   “My plan was go in on the first corner and then close the second one, because then the other rider don’t have the space and you have already the position. But okay.   I go in on the first corner and I was inside, and when I did the movement to the other corner to close, I saw him, but okay. The thing is what we saw on the TV. I feel I did correct and I did a great last corner.”   His plan was a carbon copy of what Rossi did to him, the only difference is that while he barged up Rossi's inside in the first corner, in his plan he expected Rossi to back out of it. He actually pointed out that the other rider wouldn't have space on the inside..."
motogp,3br2hk,Myrelin,5,Wed Jul 1 20:58:27 2015 UTC,"Except he DIDN'T have the position. He didn't overtake. He forced either rossi to cut or to collide. You can't get under someone then push them to the outside (to the dirt) and cry when they don't stop to let you by. It was a bad and unsafe pass. IMO obviously. Look how far Marquez pushes to the outside. He even went off a bit. Complete bullshit. I mean it's racing so good for him for trying to pass, but don't act like a saint here. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmkxUzZeaCk"
motogp,3br2hk,piratse,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:52:21 2015 UTC,And to try that in a tough chicane like that nonetheless. There was no room. That's an aggressive type of pass for a normal corner.
motogp,3br2hk,_itsaworkinprogress_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:34:33 2015 UTC,"I wasn't disputing that at all, I've watched and giffed the incident from every angle they showed. I was just providing his answer to the question of what his plan was if there was no contact (ie what the endgame was), because it's especially funny considering what he spent 10-15 minutes arguing prior to that - since his argument was that Rossi turned into him, and he (Marc) had the inside, therefore not his fault.   It was a bad pass, it happens - I still think that maybe he could have bailed out of it when he saw Rossi's entry line* (though maybe it was too late by then I'm not sure), but instead he decided to try.  It might have actually worked with some other riders, think he forgot who he was up against for a second there.  Him going into the grass though was partially due to the contact, or at least it looked like it - his bike went back to looking like a mechanical bull for a bit there. But I agree with Rossi there it would never ever have worked without contact, and I also don't think he could have had a tight exit, since he took a tight(er) line on the entry.  EDIT: *at 2 seconds in the vid, when Rossi goes wider and Marc stays on the inside."
motogp,3br2hk,Myrelin,2,Wed Jul 1 22:01:28 2015 UTC,"Oh sorry man, I wasn't saying you did, just adding to the discussion, but I could see it coming off that way. My bad. I'm all for trying, but don't cry when you didn't make it. That was 100% on him thinking he had the pace to just zip by, as if Rossi isn't one of the greatest of all times and doesn't know to brake late at that turn."
motogp,3br2hk,piratse,0,Wed Jul 1 22:03:40 2015 UTC,"My apologies too then, I think I'm a little too tired to be coherent. :)   I'm all for trying, but don't cry when you didn't make it.   Someone should really tweet this at him (though I'm sure a fair few people have). I completely agree; don't mind the on-track, but I actually felt embarrassed just watching that press conference.    doesn't know to brake late at that turn.   Yep. He's also seen his fair share of similar incidents at that chicane, and I think the take-away for him was ""don't be on the inside coming into the chicane"".   What I've been thinking about though: Marc was practicing the corner all weekend long, or so he said. Okay so he may not have known or remembered about 2002 and 2006 (and probably more similar incidents), but what about Santi? And his mechanics? They have decades of experience in the sport, why didn't someone go ""dude maybe don't try for the inside line""?"
motogp,3br2hk,Myrelin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:07:58 2015 UTC,"I know right. Someone should be like ""he knows you'll try to pass there.....maybe try something else. He's been doing this as long as you have been alive, he's not retarded.""......Though maybe that's too much to say during a race lol."
motogp,3br2hk,piratse,3,Wed Jul 1 22:09:58 2015 UTC,"And unfortunately too much to put on his pit board before the last lap! :D  I watched the ""Marc Marquez - Trophy Collector"" documentary on motogp.com when it came out, and I actually remember Santi saying (I think it was Japan 2012 when he stalled on the grid and was dead-last), that everyone in the pits knew he was going to go for the win, that he wasn't going to pay attention to Alzamora flailing at him every lap to slow down (hilarious), because he always just does whatever he wants in the end. And they knew in that case the only thing in his mind was ""win or crash"".   Guess this time around it was the same."
motogp,3br2hk,Myrelin,4,Wed Jul 1 22:12:56 2015 UTC,"In the post race interview Marquez basically said he thought Rossi was in the wrong for the incident and that he and his team believed they won the race.  When challenged by the questions from the press, he stuck to his view."
motogp,3br2hk,deadjennies_0o,6,Wed Jul 1 15:22:20 2015 UTC,"That press conference was crap, and anyone who's seen it knows that.  The press was trying to bait the two of them into arguing, and they got nowhere.  Marquez stuck to his story and Rossi did as well, as you would expect with emotions running high after the race.  There didn't seem to be any bad blood, it's not like they were clawing each other's eyes out, and the whole thing has been blown out of proportion.  In fact, the most earth shattering thing that I saw happen in that press conference was that Jorge realized that he could be funny.  Really funny, in his own not funny way."
motogp,3br2hk,inspectormac,3,Wed Jul 1 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  The press was really trying to get MM and RV to dig at each other during the post race interviews, but it seemed like the most tension the room was able to drum up was when Jorge kept asking the reporter to give his opinion of the incident.  Good times.."
motogp,3br2hk,deadjennies_0o,3,Wed Jul 1 21:29:49 2015 UTC,JL was awesome in that press conference haha
motogp,3br2hk,_Lo2W_,4,Wed Jul 1 22:22:01 2015 UTC,looked to me MM stuck his tire in Rossi's knee.
motogp,3br2hk,old_po_blu_collar,2,Wed Jul 1 16:10:48 2015 UTC,"For me there were two things he said that felt like light jabs at Rossi.   When a journalist asked what he learned from Rossi today. He answered, ""some motocross""  Then after seeing the replay of the last chicane he commented passive-aggressively ""a little motocross, nothing more""   He's blind to his own mistakes at what happened. He also cut the corner and was lucky he didn't also crash. Marc was probably still angry and he might have cooled down come the next press conference to change his opinion on how he feels about what happened."

motogp,3bqwc4,incer,6,Wed Jul 1 15:06:13 2015 UTC,Marquez rode in Moto2 without electronics (Or at least highly limited). I think it will suit him the most.

It will come down to how best your team make use of what's available, it's not like they are loosing TC or launch control etc."
motogp,3bqwc4,montyzac,2,Wed Jul 1 16:33:50 2015 UTC,Lorenzo has had a lot of trouble adapting to new tyres in the past year or so.
motogp,3bqwc4,Disgruntled__Goat,3,Wed Jul 1 15:14:51 2015 UTC,"“They say that the unified software will reduce the gap between the big teams and the small teams, but it won’t. The factory teams can afford the manpower, so they will have one engineer working on the traction control, another on the wheelie control, another on engine-braking control, another for the carburation. And what will the private team have? One guy working on all of these on his own! It’s ridiculous!”   Completely agree with this, of course the factory teams will retain their advantage, just in a different manner. In a sport so heavily dependent on money (cost of R&D, the team, the riders, the sponsorships, etc.) of course a factory team will still be able to find something extra even though everyone is working with the same stuff.  Also:   “I think the manufacturers will never find an agreement on anything!” he adds. “The way it will work is that if they have a unanimous proposal to change something in the software, then we must introduce it. All changes to the software must be agreed unanimously by all the manufacturers. But if they never find an agreement on anything, the software will stay the same forever.”   That is really scary to me."
motogp,3bqwc4,pondiki,4,Wed Jul 1 15:11:30 2015 UTC,"I think it was on MotoPod where the point was brought up that there is a overall lack of manpower in the sport for electronic technicians. It is a really niche skill and profession. In the entire paddock maybe no more than a dozen guys that are good at it, never mind the actual engineers that write the software.   Of that tiny pool of workers there are still going to be the real top guys that can fine tune the electronics and they will be working with the factories.  Remember, the shortage of labor was great enough for Honda to poach employees from Yamaha for their electronic technicians."

Nicky Hayden was an AMA SBK champion before becoming MotoGP champion and Ben Spies was AMA and WSBK champion before winning a MotoGP race.   Valentino Rossi winning half the MotoGP seasons since its inception hasn't helped SBK or GP champions crossing over - a GP champion is simply a rare breed.

He may have lined up the corner perfectly to ride through with a clear track ahead but when you've got a guy in front of you who is directly on the racing line you have to beat him into the corner.  That didn't happen, he initiated contact, and he's lucky they both made it across the finish line."

motogp,3boif5,wymaen,2,Tue Jun 30 23:58:50 2015 UTC,Exactly. That could have ended so badly for one or both of them.
motogp,3boif5,AugustFinster,3,Wed Jul 1 02:54:54 2015 UTC,"At the moment of contact, MM93 is still braking, and VR46 has already completed braking and gotten back into the throttle while still being further down the racetrack than MM93.  Does that make Marquez the leader of the race? Definitely not.  His front wheel is rubbing Rossi's forearm...that means he is behind at the moment of impact.  Whoops.  Look at their body position.  VR46 is head forward, shoulder dropped, knee down, following a line through the corner.  MM93 is braced for impact- much more midline upper body, bent elbows, significantly less lean angle.   This contact by Marquez affected them both- check the many replays and angles available.  Watch this gif and tell me that Rossi would have been able to finish the righthand half of the chicane without crashing.  In some magical faryworld, even if he had somehow completed the turn and stayed completely on the tarmac, what would have happened?  He would have smacked into Marquez in a mirror-image of what MM93 had just done to him.  His options were to try to complete an impossible turn or pick the bike up and run off track and into gravel.  I can't imagine either of these options seemed attractive at the time, and considering he had basically the width of the track (about 45 feet) to make a decision, the choice that allowed him a fighting chance to stay upright was the logical one.   ...that they both left the track, Marquez rejoined by the shortest route, as required by the rules, Rossi took the quickest route to the linetrack.   FTFY- heavy throttle in a straight line is the only possible route back when you're in gravel, full stop.   There may be a good argument to say Marquez (I'm no fan of Marquez) caused the incident...   He did.   ...and shouldn't benefit from it,   He didn't, but you still seem to feel upset by this fact.   ... but that should established by race direction with proper explanations.   It was, and strangely enough, nothing from Mike Webb sounded remotely like, ""Hurr durr Vallinteeno r best and cn dew know rong,"" but rather like, “We've obviously reviewed the incident from all the camera angles we have. The decision is racing incident. No advantage was gained.  The basis of that decision is primarily the helicopter shot that shows at every stage Valentino was ahead. So Valentino had the right to the line.  So Valentino was ahead. He was not passed. As they reached the apex of the right-hand turn Marc touched Valentino, which made [Valentino] go wide. So that's a racing incident. It's unavoidable. The two balancing things are that it was a hard pass with contact and you are not allowed to push another rider off the line. But the end result was that they entered and exited that series of corners in the same position. No advantage gained. End of story.”"

But to say that yesterday during the shithatestorm, who knows where this (my view) might end up. (Probably nowhere nice.)  edit: grammar"

The quote was :  “If I went back to racing, it would be in the golden age of the 500s, with real racing and guys like Doohan, Rainey, Schwantz, Gardner and Lawson,”   “Back then it was a sport; today it's shit.”  In what possible context that doesn't mean what it means?  Particularly:    in the golden age of the 500s, with real racing Back then it was a sport       He said current MotoGP is not ""real racing"" and not a sport.

In the years they raced each other stoner has more wins, more poles, more fastest laps and the same amount of championships but on multiple different manufactures. He also spent his first year on a satellite bike. In every metric stoner did better than Rossi when they raced against each other and he did that whilst taking part in less races...."
motogp,3bq8fr,Karl_Vos,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:51:19 2015 UTC,"He hates traction control and electronic nannies that take away a lot from the rider themselves. Honestly its pretty hard to disagree with that. Thats why they're riders, because they're the best. Giving them the electronic aids just takes away from the edge of the better riders."
motogp,3bq8fr,oh84s,15,Wed Jul 1 08:30:46 2015 UTC,"You are right. While we are at it, we should remove launch control. Also, let's remove the steering dumpers, make the bikes carburated, remove the ECU, and give them manual control of the ignition timing.   Actually, let's remove all the technology. Starting with the bikes themselves, as they are by definition complex technology, let them just run 28 laps around a 4 kilometer track, see how good they really are.   It's racing man, by definition it's going to require a lot of technology.   The truth is, if TC really did take from the sport, we would have a seen all riders qualifying with the same times, and Bautista and Hayden would have the same chances of winning as Rossi.   The fact that we see the same aliens at the top shows it is still about the Rider's ability. But MotoGP is not just about the riders, it's about the factories too. It's a competition of teams made of one man and one machine each.   If you don't like that, watch Moto2, or any of the sports where the machines are almost identical. Meanwhile, we want to see  Yamaha vs Honda vs Ducati as much as we want to see Rossi vs Marquez vs Dovizioso."

Not really. It depends what that specific riders advantage is. If two riders take identical lines but one rider has significantly better throttle control than when you introduce traction control it will level them out.    You are right. While we are at it, we should remove launch control. Also, let's remove the steering dumpers, make the bikes carburated, remove the ECU, and give them manual control of the ignition timing.    Bit of a nonsense argument really. F1 removed traction control and abs years ago and the sport was much better for it. The whole 'escalation' argument is rarely valid."
motogp,3bq8fr,oh84s,4,Wed Jul 1 08:59:13 2015 UTC,"Not really. It depends what that specific riders advantage is. If two riders take identical lines but one rider has significantly better throttle control than when you introduce traction control it will level them out.   It wouldn't level them out, at least not on equal terms. Traction control can be tailored for each rider on each corner at this level. The rider with better throttle skill won't need the traction control on the same setting as the rider with lesser skill. Less traction control kicking in allows him to pin it sooner and longer.   The rider with more skill has better feeling with the rear so he can take it closer to the edge of grip. The rider with less skill doesn't have as much familiarity with the rear so his limit with the throttle is less than his counterpart.   Electronics are better for longevity of careers. If Rossi was in the era of the 500s he will still be fast, but the likelihood of highsiding from tapping so much horsepower is higher. I honestly prefer that and see great talents continue being great than being robbed from us by chance like Rainey and Kato.   If I wanna see machine and man I'd watch something insane like the Macau GP, Irish road racing, or IOMTT."
motogp,3bq8fr,YamahaRN,5,Wed Jul 1 10:19:23 2015 UTC,"The rider with better throttle skill won't need the traction control on the same setting as the rider with lesser skill    I've got an interview with Edwards about Rossi's riding style I keep meaning to scan in and post, in which he explains that the difference between Rossi and inferior riders is all about throttle control.   Edwards saw that in his telemetry data he had the throttle pinned way more than Rossi, and Rossi basically only had the throttle pinned on straights  This meant that the traction control cut power for him wa more often than for Rossi, losing him drive and therefore time.  So the anti-traction control argument is just bullshit as better riders barely use the tc."

And one of the main things they told us is that the current generation of Fireblade is finished in terms of tuning. They might be able to make some marginal improvements, but the bike's from 2008, while most competitors already have updated their bikes. They won't be racing with the RC213V-S, unless Honda decides to produce enough of them for homologation, so for now Pata Honda is at the peak of the performance of their bike.  I gotta agree about the entertainment problem. I used to love watching WSBK, races most of the times are way more exciting than in MotoGP, but for some reason I can't get myself to watch them.

motogp,3bp9gp,YamahaRN,5,Wed Jul 1 02:42:58 2015 UTC,"Hahaha. What is there to expose? He's probably one of the most honest and transparent riders when it comes to his performance. When he's happy, you can just tell, the guy is all smiles. When he isn't, he actually talks about what is wrong, what worries him, and what he's gonna do to fix it.   I think one of his best interviews is one he gave when he left Ducati and went back to Yamaha, and he honestly says he would prefer to stay at Ducati, that it was his dream, but they tried to fix the problems with the bike and couldn't, so he has to move on. You don't usually hear riders talk like that about their former and current employer.   Anyway, we need to bring fraud46 back, sounds like fun."

Something along the lines of Lorenzo exposing Rossi for using his fame and PR to bully Dovi and Cal from graduating to the factory ream. When he crashed with Bautista in Mugello he was all over defending Bautista that Rossi was trying too hard and that Bautista was in the right.   You know the minor meme around here ""That Bradley Smith, so hot right now"" ?? That was from one of his comments where he said Smith should be in the factory M1 because of Rossi's regular FP and Qualifying woes. This was also two years ago when Rossi was still readapting to the M1.  That had to be my favorite cause it was such a big stretch."

motogp,3bosqb,SellMeSomeSleep,8,Wed Jul 1 07:48:25 2015 UTC,When Stoner is on a tear he is the most talented rider out there. But he's far from the most talented racer out there. Unfortunately winning titles requires much more than being able to ride a bike past the limit. Which is why (despite godlike talent) he only managed two titles in seven years.
motogp,3bosqb,wynns123,3,Wed Jul 1 00:52:17 2015 UTC,Which is why (despite godlike talent) he only managed two titles in seven years.    Also that is not a fair criticism of a rider. Stoner's records during that 7 years were better than any of the others during the same period.   From 2006-2012 Stoner won 38 races and 2 world championships.   From 2006-2012 Rossi won 24 races and 2 world championships.  From 2008-2014 Lorenzo won 33 races and 2 world championships. (adjusted as he didn't start till 2 years later).  The problem for all 3 of those riders is that the other 2 existed during that period. Had any of them been alone they no doubt would have cleaned up.
motogp,3bosqb,oh84s,2,Wed Jul 1 10:40:42 2015 UTC,"The problem for all 3 of those riders is that the other 2 existed during that period.

Stoner combing back would just make it that much more interesting. If they all stick around as Rossi, we're in for a good next decade of racing, with new talent hopefully making it to the top class as we go along."
motogp,3bosqb,Bedeone,2,Wed Jul 1 13:09:31 2015 UTC,"Which is why (despite godlike talent) he only managed two titles in seven years.   Bit of a quality in machinery between him and his main rivals. The 2008, 2009, 2010 Ducati had no right winning a title. If anything he flattered them. Rossi didn't exactly have spectacular results on the Ducs either.  I tend to agree with him probably not being the complete package as Rossi or Lorenzo, but his ultimate pace was every bit as fast, if not slightly faster. Rossi and Lorenzo both seemed more consistent in all areas of their racing, race craft, race starts etc. But I think the main reason for the vast different rating by fans is that Stoner had no element of PR to him. He self admittedly hates crowds, he didn't like talking to fans and he never celebrated after a win in a way that fans felt his joy. Meanwhile Rossi is the exact opposite, he's a PR master and lets the fans feel his joy. Lorenzo is probably somewhere inbetween.  The only ""Stoner fans"" seemingly are Australians."
motogp,3bosqb,oh84s,5,Wed Jul 1 02:13:56 2015 UTC,"I'm Australian and find Stoner to be quite annoying. Pretty much every rider on the grid, when he was racing, was more likable. I can't say I ever rooted for him during a race."
motogp,3bosqb,KICKERMAN360,5,Wed Jul 1 08:39:35 2015 UTC,"I never said every Australian is his fan. I just said most of his fans are Australian.  I never found him particularly likable as a person, but I don't think he was as bad as people make out. Most of the negative views towards him are to do with him challenging/beating Rossi and their little rivalry. He's a bit of a dry kind of person but you've got to respect that talent."

motogp,3bosqb,Bretty_boy,2,Wed Jul 1 11:37:14 2015 UTC,"Tend to agree. I used to describe Stoner as 'the fastest rider on the track but not the fastest racer' and I stand by that description.

motogp,3bosqb,oh84s,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:42:02 2015 UTC,"Win rate doesn't matter really. Ago is the rider with the most wins followed by Rossi.   The trouble with saying ""talent"" is that it's really subjective. Races won is really the only metric that we can use. And it's what counts in racing."
motogp,3bosqb,jgrant68,2,Thu Jul 2 01:25:48 2015 UTC,"You were the one who bought up 'winning races is all that really matters'.  Win rate is an important discussion, because a rider of similar skill that has competed in 15 seasons will have more wins than one who has competed in 7 seasons. Thats just a matter of competing in more races. If you want to base skill on the pure amass of wins you can compile then of course the riders who stay around for longer will have more. I don't really think that takes from Stoner's natural ability, had he stayed around for several more seasons would have certainly won a lot more races."
motogp,3bosqb,oh84s,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:32:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that races won matters not win rate. You can have a win rate of 100% and only compete once.  I'm not saying that he's not a good rider. But I don't think that he's the most talented rider."
motogp,3bosqb,jgrant68,2,Thu Jul 2 01:37:58 2015 UTC,"I still think that just favors riders who are in the sport for longer. Look at Mick Doohan, 54 open class wins on 500cc machinery in 10 seasons. He was showing no signs of slowing prior to his injury either."
motogp,3bosqb,oh84s,-7,Thu Jul 2 02:00:56 2015 UTC,"The Casey Stoner fanboys are getting pretty annoying. The main reason he won in 2007 was because Ducati had a good jump on Honda and Yamaha for that season (Rule change). Then they were overtaken quite categorically the next season by Yamaha. Then in 2012 he obviously had one of the best bikes so naturally you expect a good rider to win (Also, interestingly, another rule change where Honda had a pretty.  He is a good rider but he never really proved himself over many different bikes like Vale, Ago, Lorenzo, Marquez etc. He won no 125 or 250cc titles however did win in his 2nd MotoGP season. But then he left HRC when he had one rough year?  Casey isn't a god and people overstate his abilities all the time. A great rider isn't always the fastest, they get the most points in the year. There have been plenty of riders who had really good skills and innovative ways to go quick, but most never won a championship. The great riders had the skills to bring home the points."
motogp,3bosqb,KICKERMAN360,3,Wed Jul 1 08:39:02 2015 UTC,"For the record, Stoner has won world titles on two different makes (Ducati and Honda) of bikes which matches Rossi (Honda and Yamaha) in MGP terms although certainly he did not win a title in the 125/250 categories as did Rossi, Lorenzo, Pedrosa etc so I do struggle to understand that he did not prove himself across 'different bikes like Vale, Lorenzo (MGP only won on a Yamaha), Ago (MV Augusta which had a marked advantage) etc.  As for leaving Honda after one rough year I suspect that is debatable as he announced his retirement around half way through the year whilst still competitive and did return after his leg injury to once again own Phillip Island and compete well.   The line regarding people over stating his abilities is interesting as many of these people are well regarded in the sport (Suppo, Puig, Gabbarini), fellow riders (Pedrosa, Lorenzo, Bautista, Crutchlow etc) as well as ex world champions in other categories (Spies etc). Personally if these guys say that someone is above the norm than I am prepared to accept that they do know what they are talking about, and for these guys personality means nothing as they are looking at the riders skills, ability and down right pace, and in all three Stoner is well above the vast majority.  Very true that the great riders bought home the points and Stoner did bring home the most points for two years which must mean that he is better than many who have never bought home that many points or race wins through out their careers.  At the end or a riders career people remember the riding and results and in this aspect Stoner's short MotoGP career returned numbers far better than many others in the game"
motogp,3bosqb,gco0307,-2,Wed Jul 1 09:43:00 2015 UTC,"Vale has won on 125cc, 250cc, 500cc, MotoGP Honda, Yamaha, and through all the different cc's. Those are different bikes. Stoner has only really had success on 250cc and two formulas of MotoGP on Ducati and Honda. And like I said, the Ducati was a lot of luck from Ducati. All I'm saying is people keep Stoner is near god-like in riding when the reality he is no more 'god-like- than Lorenzo (who I'd argue is a better, or as good rider) or Pedrosa (who doesn't have the championships to back it up but has been competitive for a very long time)."
motogp,3bosqb,KICKERMAN360,3,Wed Jul 1 10:27:00 2015 UTC,"Stoner has won races on 125cc, 250cc two stroke machines (no championships) and did not get an opportunity to ride the 500cc machines (something I suspect many riders wish that they had an opportunity to do). In addition (and Like Valentino here) he has won on the 800cc and 1000 four stroke machines (technically you could include Valentino on the 990cc era) with Lorenzo winning his championships on 125, 250, 800 and 1000cc machines.  I have said elsewhere and stand by it that Stoner is one of the best riders we have had the priviledge of seeing over the last 20 or so years, perhaps the outright best (debatable). But as far as racing, well there are a number I personally believe to be better racers than was Stoner as for me there is a marked difference between riding and racing at this level (this does not diminish achievements either way as no matter what the naysayers wish to state, Stoner still has more World Titles than many riders, and more MotoGP titles than some considered far better)  EDIT TO ADD: Technically each year is a different bike as with changes and development the way in which the bike reacts can be diametrically different (look at the Honda between 2014/2015 for example) OIf course we also need to look at the tyres in this which definietly goes in Rossi's favour having won on Bridgestone (as with Stoner/Lorenzo) and Michelin in the era of SNS (although it is widely recognised that in his only Michelin year, Stoner  and the LCR team were on tier 3 of supply)"
motogp,3bosqb,gco0307,3,Wed Jul 1 10:45:04 2015 UTC,or Pedrosa (who doesn't have the championships to back it up but has been competitive for a very long time).   I don't think Pedrosa is in the same league as Rossi/Lorenzo/Stoner/Marquez. He's probably best of the rest.

motogp,3bowv4,gnualmafuerte,2,Fri Jul 3 03:02:01 2015 UTC,"Regarding MotoGP, I'd say Mugello or Assen. For the wife, Nothing beats Le Mans. The city itself is beautiful, nothing beats the charm of an ancient French village, and it's only an hour away from Paris (And being Europe, trains are awesome, safe and plentiful).   That being said, a bit biased probably, but Argentina is a relatively new addition to the MotoGP that makes for both interesting races (very fast flowing circuit, this year it was probably the most interesting race thanks to Valentino), and it's a fantastic destination for tourism. On top of that, Argentina is insanely cheap for foreigners (given our current exchange rate). The city were the race is held, Termas de Rio Hondo, is a fantastic destination with loads of touristic attractions, including the natural thermal waters. Besides that, there is a lot to do in Argentina, including visiting many other destinations that are only a (very cheap) flight away. Whatever extra you spend in getting all the way over here, you'll save many times over. And don't forget the food, every person I've known that has traveled to Argentina left absolutely crazy about our Asado, insisting it was the best food they'd ever tasted.   Maybe take a look at a fairly informative post I made a few days ago with some fantastic pictures and information about the best destinations in Argentina, and how you can visit them all for cheap on the same trip."

And then there will be the support of a hundred thousand or more delirious fans [for Rossi].  Even without the crowd, there is nowhere like Mugello. The track is arguably the world’s greatest: hugely fast, it gets the attention of GP riders like no other. Some riders speak of having to defy the laws of physics to get round there fast.  By night during GP weekend the circuit resembles a scene from Mad Max: campfires glowing across the hillsides, out-of-their-minds petrol-heads revving unsilenced static engines to hell and back, their baleful roar counterpointed by the staccato racket of a few dozen inline fours bouncing off the rev limiter.

motogp,3bn96n,ross_rossifumi,12,Tue Jun 30 16:11:44 2015 UTC,"For those without Video pass  Phil Read   Valentino was very clever. He was actually being pushed out the circuit by Marquez. But He realized to pick it up, go straight, jump the kerb, and gently open the throttle, and go straight across. He won by 50 meters. Brilliant riding, brilliant. I think i, it was a racing incident that Valentino took advantage of Marquez causing him to run out of road, but he made a advantage of it. Cut the corner, but terrific, yeah.    Giacomo Agostini   I think Valentino, he cannot cut the chicane. But Marquez cannot push him out. So I think if I'm the jury, I just stop the race in the corner. So who was leading is the winner. At that time it was Valentino so he's the winner.    Freddie Spencer   In the end Valentino won the race, and he was definitely the strongest. Marc tried, did a good job trying very hard in the end. Made up the distance , but just couldn't pull it off. But for him to come back he's had a rough couple of races. So he rode a good race too.    Casey Stoner   I haven't had a chance to watch the race. But uh what (mumble mumble) I heard a little bit of what's going on and Valentino miraculously pulled it out again. I heard it was a fantastic battle. So it's fantastic.

It will be really hot, there is not a lot of shade. If you have never been to a motorsport before, bring earplugs, its insanely loud. You will be walking a lot unless you want to sit at one corner the whole race. Besides the Corkscrew, some other good spots are the shaded hill overlooking the first corner, inside the track looking at corners 3 and 4, and on the front side of the hill looking down as they come around from the back part of the track. This year paddock passes are included in the standard ticket, so make sure you visit it, look at the bikes, maybe get a few autographs."

They might have you park for free on a nearby high school, and then take you by coach to the track, or you pay something like $10 for parking on the dirt. Keep this windows up! Traffic last year was minimal to none existent. If you're coming from SF, then try to take HWY1 instead of 101 which is usually packed. East bay, then take 17 north (very pretty) but sometimes has heavy traffic, then make you're way to 880 or wherever. If you're coming from somewhere south of the track, then I'm not sure. Check by your local Costco or call some nearby ones. They've had a 2 ticket pack for $70 for WSBK and MotoGP before that."

motogp,3bk9hm,motogpfan,3,Tue Jun 30 08:19:03 2015 UTC,They did in 2005 at Laguna use a very similar one.  And in the Valencia race that same year they used the Red/White version.  The sponsor at the time was Gauloises and I believe they only had the deal for 15 of the 17 races to allow them to do this.

This looks like he actually sees Marquez as a threat:   I’m very happy for my [points] advantage over Marquez, for me – from now until the end of the season – he will become a big problem again   With 10 more races to come, Marquez would need to gain 7.5 points per race to beat Rossi for the title."
motogp,3bl68n,illyndor,3,Tue Jun 30 12:12:25 2015 UTC,"Rossi is too sensible to discount Marquez, he knows DNFs are unpredictable and can throw a championship open at any time.  Interestingly, I read an article earlier where Graziano was asked if Rossi and Marquez had fallen out over the incident at Assen - and Graziano said that Rossi had already distanced himself from Marquez before Assen so that they are no longer friends, enabling Rossi to properly compete with him.  At least that's what google translate told me! Link"

motogp,3bl68n,Myrelin,2,Tue Jun 30 15:52:51 2015 UTC,Its never good to be arrogant. Rossi came back from a very similarly large deficit in 06 to nearly win the title. Although Rossi was an  superior rider to Hayden.
motogp,3bl68n,oh84s,3,Tue Jun 30 05:12:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, but it was less Rossi's performance but yamaha must have been ashamed to let him suffer so much in terms of mechanical problems.

motogp,3bl68n,YamahaRN,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:19:04 2015 UTC,"Was Stoner really as good as Rossi though?  My memory could be playing tricks on me, but Rossi absolutely destroyed Stoner in tactics and in the corners, but Stoner had a bike that was always picking up a second or two in every straight away...  It was blatantly obvious the bike bailed him out of all his mistakes from what I recall.  Hell I remember i quit watching (can't remember exact season) when Stoners Ducati literally ran away from the competition like they were stock street bikes on the track.  That had little to do with skill and everything to do with an overly dominate bike (which imho ruins the sport)."
motogp,3bl68n,Deviltry,2,Tue Jun 30 16:27:56 2015 UTC,"The bikes clearly had different strengths but Stoner won 10 races to Rossi's 4 and Stoner didn't have a single at fault non finish while Rossi had at least one and possibly two, I can't really remember. I don't know what you mean about destroying in 'corners', Stoner was significantly quicker all through 2007 and if anything Rossi was the one making the errors.   It was actually good to rewatch, because like I said I never really saw Stoner in his early Ducati years and now I understand fully why people rave about his speed. His team mates couldn't do anything on those bikes and he was dominating race after race."

I remember the days where satellite riders could win races so often that they would regularly beat factory riders cough Hayden in the championship.  That we have such talented riders today as grid fillers is a massive shame, imo."

Remember Bradl's performances at Laguna Seca and Qatar in 2013? Bautista may be a bit more of a stretch. Cal needs some more time on the bike, I think. The potential is there, though.  Tech3 bikes seem a bit further off there factory Yamaha bikes, but then again. Yamaha doesn't have quite the resources that Honda does."
motogp,3bmzr9,buhuhilus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"True, but Melandri and Gibernau were arguably as good as or better riders than Hayden. Crutchlow, Espargaro and Smith are not on that level with any of: Rossi, Lorenzo, Marquez, Pedrosa. Obviously the difference in bike quality is bigger than it was in 2006, but I could still see Rossi beating Smith a few times over a season if they swapped bikes."
motogp,3bmzr9,amillion3,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:21:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah probably, but I would be willing to bet that - because the level of the Movistar and Repsol squads is so high - Rossi may be able to beat Smith if they swapped bikes, but he couldn't win a race with a tech3 bike."

He wants races without traction control or with less electronics which is fine, that's his style and so on, smooth, controlled, precise. But these are the rules, adapt or quit. And he quit. Also, it's about his daughter. It's hard to take the risks you need to take to be on top when you have kids.  But there is no need to badmouth a competiton when it was your decision to leave it.

motogp,3bmzr9,gnualmafuerte,20,Tue Jun 30 17:38:47 2015 UTC,"No, because Rossi didn't quit at the peak of his career cuz he wasnt having any fun and then still hang around after bitching about it."

I'm assuming that he's leaning on that tired argument about ""electronics"" ruining the sport, but its a woefully myopic one. Racing is a platform for R&D so that manufacturers can make better quality products. Racing 2 strokes was fun, but its not applicable to modern engineering, so too, not allowing R&D on the electronics packages stunts the growth of the industry. The addition of rider aids doesnt reduce the skill necessary to race and win, it just shifts the skill set, and adds new facets of what it means to be a competent pilot.   Frankly, this statement of his comes off so condescending that i'm glad he's not racing in GP. His attitude is a step backward."
motogp,3bmzr9,SellMeSomeSleep,3,Tue Jun 30 15:13:26 2015 UTC,"Very much does depends on the context.   The state of MotoGP as a competitive sport actually isn't very good. Disaster aside you aren't winning unless you have one of two bikes, that's been the case since he last won on the Ducati.   Hear yourself explain that to a non fan, sounds a little ridiculous.   Really if we all were honest we would love to see different winners on different bikes, riders in privateer teams having a shot at a win by plucky talent but no budget.  This is the state of many top level Motorsports however, I guess they mature to a point where money and rules keep a few teams at the top who can dominate for a period. Cost to entry for that elite group is high and it's in the interest of that group to keep it that way."

motogp,3bmzr9,SoftwareMaven,3,Tue Jun 30 16:28:38 2015 UTC,"Riders have talked about hitting TC slowing you down, it's like applying rear brake. Same with ABS making you slow down less than applying brakes to the very limit of what the tire can handle. So the best guys are working hard at not making the electronics kick in. This keeps the skill ceiling similar, while at the same time making the sport safer.  What would have been a crash is now you going wide and losing some positions."

motogp,3bmzr9,Myrelin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:27:51 2015 UTC,"Man, all the hate for Casey Stoner around here but what I mainly see here is a lynch mob mentality where all you guys are ready to downvote anyone who doesn't go with the status quo and anyone who wants to defend Stoner is unlikely to do so since this lynch mob mentality isn't exactly subtle.   If you guys think MotoGP is currently awesome, then you guys are kidding yourselves.    The current situation is almost like the situation F1 is in.  The cost is too high for some teams to compete.  The CRT bikes MotoGP introduced were a total failure and although this years Open Class tightens up the field a little more, everyone knew before the season started that it was going to be either Honda or Yamaha that's going to win the championship.    But the fact is that when you have to mix the field with bikes that have full factory support with teams that have a limited budget but given special concessions such as more fuel and more engines, then it's a fail.  How is this supposed to be competition in the first place?  And it's not like MotoGP isn't trying to fix the cost issue.  That was what all this ""Spec"" ECU and Software were all about but it's Honda who are the true whiners because they didn't want to concede.    I use to be a ""Honda guy"" but after seeing them leave F1 twice in my lifetime and threatening to leave IndyCar if concessions weren't going to made to allow some aero mods even though they agreed to aero development freeze, let Honda leave.  The MotoGP grid will probably be more competitive without them and their snobby ass engineers.  Hell, with Honda gone, we might see more manufacturers entering the field such as Triumph, MV Agusta, BMW and hell, Kawasaki might make a return."
motogp,3bmzr9,pbae,3,Tue Jun 30 19:50:02 2015 UTC,"They are fixing the cost issue. You can check the sidebar, I wrote down some points from the changes coming for the next 6 years, which will stabilise the sport; Dorna will basically pay the costs of the leased bikes for the private teams.  There will also be 6 manufacturers. Right now, Honda and Yamaha are battling it out, with Ducati in the mix and Suzuki improving. There are in fact Two Ducatis in the top 5, and Bradley Smith is in 6th place in the standings. It's an exciting season.  Right now, there are three - maybe four - riders in contention for the championship, on bikes from three different manufacturers.   But you're not even addressing what Stoner said. He was talking about 500cc two strokes and the racing, you're talking about costs.    everyone knew before the season started that it was going to be either Honda or Yamaha that's going to win the championship.   K, let's look at the golden age of racing. Doohan's '96 season. Top 4: Honda NSRs. Then a Yamaha, a Suzuki, two more Hondas... Okay.   Well cool. 1986 then.  Yamaha, Honda, 4 Yamahas, Honda... Hmm. Interesting.   I mean 1980-2006 was all Honda and Yamaha, with three four (can't count) Suzuki wins added in.   Doesn't mean the racing wasn't good. And Yamaha and Honda battling it out now doesn't mean the racing isn't good. And let's add Ducati in there, since they sure helped make the season-opener a treat.  I'm not ""hating"" on Stoner, I simply disagree because I find the racing exciting. Especially this season."
motogp,3bmzr9,long_eggs,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:46:36 2015 UTC,"Isn't Ducati part of the ""Open Class"" of bikes where they're allowed more engine and more fuel?  Would Ducati be this competitive if they didn't have those two advantages?    Yeah, there are 6 teams but really, only 3 of them count which are Honda, Yamaha and Suzuki since they're full on factory outfits without any special concessions.  And I am addressing what Stoner said.  All Stoner basically said was today's MotoGP is shit and he's correct since MotoGP costs too much for the smaller teams to be competitive and had to make an ""Open Class"" class so there would be more than 8 bikes racing.  Now that's sad."
motogp,3bmzr9,SellMeSomeSleep,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:59:25 2015 UTC,"Suzuki have concessions too. Every new manufacturer coming into the sport does. And Ducati's in the ""Factory Open"" class.  And there aren't 6 factories currently, but there will be by 2017: Aprilia, Ducati, Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and KTM. Aprilia is coming in next year already (IIRC with concessions, until they get a certain number of podiums and/or wins).  Ducati and Suzuki's biggest advantage is arguably the ""qualifying"" (softer) tyres. Ducatis also have a strong race pace, so the aliens have mostly been complaining about them, saying they need to lose their concessions.  And they will, for next year.   Ducati are to lose their concessions for the 2016 MotoGP season. Meeting at Assen, the Grand Prix Commission decided to apply the system of concession points which was due to take effect from the 2016 season to the results of Ducati for this season. This means that from next year, Ducati will race under the same rules as Honda and Yamaha, which means that they will have seven engines per season, with no development allowed during the season, and testing with factory riders restricted to official tests and a handful of private tests.   (motomatters)  With the new point-system for concessions (which can be gained and lost), it'll help level the playing field even more.    And I am addressing what Stoner said. All Stoner basically said was today's MotoGP is shit and he's correct  since MotoGP costs too much for the smaller teams   He was talking about the racing and the bikes. I don't see what you're talking about in the article. He doesn't like electronics, his loss - nothing to comment on that. But as for the racing - it is spectacular. Especially this season.  And as I pointed out - Honda vs. Yamaha leading the way isn't new. And it was there in the ""golden era"" Stoner talks about, when racing was still racing - according to him. So he wasn't talking about the number of manufacturers.   ""real racing and guys like Doohan, Rainey, Schwantz, Gardner and Lawson""  Well, now instead we have four aliens on the factory Yamahas and Hondas, two Andreas on the Ducatis, and 3 factories and 7 riders on the podium. And we're watching the GOAT and who might just be the GOAT in the making battle it out. I'd say there is racing.  And like I said - the FIM and Dorna have worked hard on ensuring Private Teams have a better chance to be competitive, and the new regs are coming in next year already. And the fact that the technical regulations won't change until 2021 means smaller teams can be more competitive (new regs = money).   So I still don't see the sport as sad, or shit. Especially not in terms of the racing.   Oh, and from your last post - Honda leaving wouldn't mean more manufacturers entering; just a maximum of one. The grid will be limited to 24 bikes. No more new manufacturers after KTM arrives as the sixth and final manufacturer in 2017. So that means 12 spots for manufacturers, 12 for private teams."

But if you think it's fair that some teams get concessions to level out the playing field makes the racing more exciting, more power to you.

It's as if the satisfaction of riding MotoGP bikes fast dropped away as the electronics cranked up in performance. I'm sure that the level of satisfaction derived from riding them quickly has changed.    Maybe it was the fine throttle and traction control (by hand) and generally challenging bikes to ride that gave him the most satisfaction in which case the current state of them might not be to his liking much at all. He liked one type of riding and now it's moved to something else that isn't to his liking. It'd be cool if he gave British Superbikes a trial to see what he thought of them. No traction control allowed at all with them.     He will definitely never be a diplomat and I respect people that give their honest opinions but it would be a lot better to articulate why he has these opinions given his in depth knowledge of the sport and riding. I hope it isn't just journos trimming off what he says in the name of getting controversial quotes."

motogp,3bivh8,gnualmafuerte,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:57:40 2015 UTC,"Wow that are some heavy crashes. It's unbelievable that these drivers are still alive and could continue racing.   I know from racing with cars, that the more you roll, the better it is because the rolling absorbs the energy slowly.  Anyways, how is it with bike races? If you fall, would it be better to make several rolls or just slide? Wich one stops you faster?"
motogp,3bivh8,servenToGo,3,Mon Jun 29 19:56:40 2015 UTC,"It's always better to slide than to roll, if you have enough buffer zone. With proper gear, sliding is not an issue, and it's the sudden deceleration or bumping against the tarmac/walls that can seriously hurt you."
motogp,3bivh8,Ehralur,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:35:06 2015 UTC,"Depends how you fall of your bike. If you don't start rolling you normally don't. It might increase the chance of hurting you arms or legs. That is my opinion, but someone who got a racing license might have another or more detailed explanation."
motogp,3bivh8,motogpfan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:56:28 2015 UTC,"Not an expert either, but as far as I know as long as you keep sliding, especially off-tarmac, you usually don't get hurt. Tumbling is not too terribly either, but you risk breaking fingers and toes especially. The biggest injuries in MotoGP usually comes from high-siders or contact with a bike."
motogp,3bivh8,sembello,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:21:52 2015 UTC,"Better to slide for sure. It's like the car rolling, energy is dispersed through friction. Ideally you want infinite run off space to slide to a stop, but I shit you not the friction from sliding burns fucking bad!"

motogp,3bggir,Puppysmasher,6,Mon Jun 29 16:56:30 2015 UTC,"Couple things.  He was in the lead, contact resulted in going off track.   To avoid falling he had to stand the bike up and ride through.  Any lean would have resulted in a crash.  After riding through he was still in the lead... therefore the required 'cut' didn't result in a change in position.  Had Rossi been passed prior to contact and done the same cut, and then taken the lead back, it is likely they would have given the win to Marquez."

motogp,3bggir,Iworkonspace,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"The announcers did address it, basically saying as such. Marc didn't get in front, hit Rossi who was forced to cut the corner thru the gravel. Marc btw, also cut the corner and rode thru the astro turf. No wheel in front = no position for you. I think the announcers just saw it like race direction did, a clear cut racing incident where the riders entered and exited the corner in the same positions, so no reason to drone on about it. The interwebz / media after is looking for any reason to talk scandal, but it really was cut and dry."
motogp,3bhk48,YamahaRN,10,Mon Jun 29 07:29:29 2015 UTC,"My favorite bit   Bradley Smith had an illuminating take on the entire incident. ""Valentino played the circumstance perfectly to his advantage,"" Smith said. ""He made sure Marc hit him so then he had to go across the gravel and no one can say anything. That’s finally what it is. There’s however many years of experience right there. He closed the door. He timed it perfectly so that when Marc went for it he hit him and knocked him off the track. Then you can’t say anything because Valentino said 'yeah, I’m going to make the corner'. Whether he could or not is up to interpretation but he can say 'the reason why I went straight on is because Marc hit me and I had the lead going into the chicane so I didn’t actually technically gain an advantage so I should actually win the race'."""
motogp,3bhk48,mavam,5,Mon Jun 29 07:40:44 2015 UTC,"The logic here seems sound but I'm not sure it's accurate. Contact can be devastating in this sport so I'm not convinced Rossi would approach it this way. I could be wrong but I'm not sold on Smith's take here.  edit: man, I don't know. I know Rossi isn't an angel and I'm cool with that but looking at the aerial shot, it does make me wonder if he more or less knew what Marc would do and planned it. Still, I doubt it. I think he picked his line and Marc forgot he was racing against other riders.  http://fat.gfycat.com/RareEquatorialHartebeest.webm"
motogp,3bhk48,CyclonusRIP,2,Mon Jun 29 14:52:05 2015 UTC,"Rossi is good enough to pull it off.  He knew Marquez would be there.  Rossi has probably pulled that same move before himself.  I don't think someone at Rossi's skill level is scared of a little contact.  Especially when he knows it's coming.  Rossi has always had a bit of a motocross style, and that's pretty much just a classic brake check move.  You just take the guys line away that's following you and sit on the brakes an extra tick to kill their momentum and you get a bit of a gap because you threw them off a bit."
motogp,3bhk48,shia_le_buff,2,Tue Jun 30 03:14:21 2015 UTC,It's okay if it is in fact planned by rossi. That's what makes me love him though. He's a master tactician. He's a lovable cunning bastard who happens to be really fucking fast at racing motorcycle :)
motogp,3bhk48,r2o,2,Mon Jun 29 15:24:07 2015 UTC,"The logic here seems sound but I'm not sure it's accurate   Exactly..  Nobody plans to let themselves get hit.. that's ridiculous.  Especially on your brake side.  It's just too easy to go down.     Bradley is usually spot on, but he's a bit off with that statement.  It would have been more accurate to say, that Valentino intended to close the door to ensure that any pass attempt was thorough.   No half-hearted lunges for a block-pass, which is essentially what happened.   Just about any other rider would have fallen in-line at having the door closed on them, but not Marc.  And it's OK that Marc made the attempt, I have no problem with that.  I do have a problem with him sticking to his story even after reviewing the video.  Though I don't think I've heard any of his comments since he's watched the video.   Clearly his statements about no leaving the track are incorrect. He did.  So if he sticks to his story, then shame on him."
motogp,3bhk48,Puppysmasher,4,Mon Jun 29 15:22:22 2015 UTC,"Nobody plans to let themselves get hit..   I am not so sure, Rossi closed the door but I would not put it past him to expect MM to just dive up anyway. Rossi probably wasn't betting on contact as an excuse to run through the gravel but he sure has hell was expecting physical contact and was mentally prepared for it, hence how he probably already had a escape route (gravel) planned out ahead. He didn't even skip a beat when MM bumped him.  So it probably wasn't ""I am going to let MM bump me and then I can win through the gravel"" but more ""I am going to close the door, but if he hits me, I am ready to go through the gravel""."
motogp,3bhk48,cantpee,2,Mon Jun 29 18:06:56 2015 UTC,I agree 100%. I knew this was going to happen as soon as Rossi re-passed MM. I'm sure Rossi saw it coming a day ahead and did some 'contingency planning.' Y'all don't give the Doctor enough credit.
motogp,3bhk48,likes2gofast,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:40:37 2015 UTC,"upvote. At least a day ahead, I am sure he knew the gravel depth.   VR46 has raced 20 years. 9 championships. 9 race wins at Assen.   Hypothesis: he was surprised at a last lap lunge in the final chicane. (WTF??? ) Response: created at the moment  Alternate Hypothesis: He expected his Anakin to take the lunge, to take the bait. Knew gravel trap was shallow, could be driven over. Uccio probably measured it Thursday during a track walk. Approached corner with 3 choices: too fast to be caught (nope), behind Marquez and needing to make the lunge (nope), or in front of Marquez and waiting for Marc to make the dramatic lunge that he watched 1000 times on ""Faster""/""Fastest"" and try to take the win.   Possible responses on Alternate Hypothesis:  1. crash (could happen, see 2006) 2. get bumped and drive over gravel trap, short cutting course. Rulebook says ok, likely expectation of race direction would be ""racing incident"" 3. let Marc by and follow to finish, getting second (uh, no)  Who could possibly think that the guy who had won at almost 50% of the races he had entered there at the Global level, could predict the likely response of the guy who has mimicked many of his moves, at the last corner, where VR46 himself says ""you have to try"" .   There is no way that VR46 could have expected that (1)  /s   (1) I would bet $100 that Lin Jarvis and Vale had the bike at his ranch to investigate how it handled in loose gravel.

motogp,3bhk48,r2o,-1,Tue Jun 30 04:56:32 2015 UTC,"I am not so sure, Rossi closed the door but I would not put it past him to expect MM to just dive up anyway.   Hehe, No, no.. no..  just. no.    You NEVER want to get hit as a racer.   Especially in that chicane.. it's a HARD chicane where you're at almost full lean angle for the first part of it.  You do not want to get hit or even touched at full lean angle.  Nope.  He was basically doing the same thing he did early which is closing the door.  He knew there was a possibility Marc could try a move, so that's why you slam the door..  Rossi had the a defensive line being 3/4 of the way to the outside curb.. Anybody trying to pass would be out of position (far too inside) to make the turn properly.   A sensible rider would have conceded and fallen in line.     That's not Marc's style though.  Watch Rossi concede the position when JLo slams the door on him at @2:47..  If Rossi did what Marc did, there would have been a collision..  Lorenzo was ahead and had the right to slam the door and force Rossi behind.. Just like Rossi did in Assen to Marc.   Marc just doesn't give in though and that's why he's been so criticized.  That's it. :)  Also, if you get hit, you stand the bike up (if you don't go down)  It just so happens that this was a chicane which means he crossed the gravel."
motogp,3bhk48,Puppysmasher,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:40:15 2015 UTC,"I think you are misinterpreting my post :)   You NEVER want to get hit as a racer   I never said Rossi wanted to get hit, I am saying he most likely anticipated physical contact when he closed the door and had an exit strategy planned. The way he instantly wheeled over the curb through the gravel sort of shows to me he was mentally prepared for the worst because it was MM.  Anticipating contact and actually wanting contact are two different things. I never said Rossi had some grand plan for forcing contact so he could have an excuse to go through the gravel. However it wasn't like he just closed the door and was like ""well thats that, no need to worry about MM diving in anyway""."
motogp,3bhk48,r2o,0,Mon Jun 29 23:52:40 2015 UTC,"I think you are misinterpreting my post :)   Perhaps. :)  My point is there is/was no 'exit strategy' though.   Rossi didn't do anything differently than Gibernau or JLo at Jerez when they were hit in the final turn. They stood the bike up and went straight.  The difference is that Jerez is a hairpin turn, so their gravel ride (exit strategy) was to nowhere. lol"

motogp,3bhk48,MT1982,8,Mon Jun 29 08:06:14 2015 UTC,I'm a massive Rossi fan and that doesn't upset me in the slightest.  If he legitimately thought that out then that's brilliant thinking on his part.
motogp,3bhk48,Ih8Hondas,3,Mon Jun 29 12:13:56 2015 UTC,"Same. My first thought after it happened was, ""he probably planned that."" He's a fucking genius on the track. He deserves every bit of his Il Dottore nickame."
motogp,3bhk48,buhuhilus,3,Mon Jun 29 22:11:18 2015 UTC,"Exactly, amazing. I just wished he'd done it to Lorenzo."
motogp,3bhk48,ElectReaver,5,Mon Jun 29 13:04:04 2015 UTC,"Actually he probably had it thought out before the race, like Marquez talked about practicing his ""move"" in free practice, Vale probably thought one step ahead and planned for Marquez move."
motogp,3bhk48,agentnico,3,Mon Jun 29 14:32:56 2015 UTC,I think the part some people are missing is that it's clear Rossi would've made the corner while Marquez would've gone into the turf if not the gravel. It was a bonsai move irrespective of staying on the racing surface.
motogp,3bhk48,intortus,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:31:51 2015 UTC,"Marquez overshot that corner even after using Rossi as a berm. I'm glad he went for it, we all would've been disappointed if he hadn't, but he wasn't even close to winning that race.  I think it also showed how accustomed Marquez is to getting easy overtakes handed to him during a race. There have been numerous races where he's gotten a bad start or whatever and carved his way through the field. Most riders give way, but not when a race win is at stake, with the championship so tight."
motogp,3bhk48,cantpee,2,Mon Jun 29 15:58:10 2015 UTC,"And certain riders have learned not to take that kind of shit from him: Rossi, JLo, and Hard Dick, for example."
motogp,3bhk48,Bedeone,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:18:07 2015 UTC,"Only reason Marquez went wide is because of the touch. They touched because of Marquez's actions, that much is obvious. But he would have made that chicane without going off the track if Rossi were one of the B-tier riders that you can bully out of a win.  Good thing he's not that kind of rider, makes for good races."
motogp,3bhk48,cantpee,3,Mon Jun 29 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"It's possible a lesser rider would've crashed at that turn when Marc plowed into him. MM would then have been penalized. It's impossible to say now, but I don't think there was anything to gain by that move.   He went for it, but it was unnecessary."
motogp,3bhk48,Bedeone,0,Mon Jun 29 18:11:18 2015 UTC,"He went for it, but it was unnecessary.   You're not wrong.  A lesser rider would have crashed, or panicked at the sight of Marc's front wheel, dropping speed and bodging the chicane, ending second. Without any contact at all. That's not blaming Rossi at all though, touch was still Marc's doing."
motogp,3bhk48,from_dust,4,Mon Jun 29 18:15:42 2015 UTC,"I love David Emmett's writing. This is an excellent article on the issue. After talking with someone yesterday who seemed to be of the mindset that Rossi was deserving of penalty, i think David explains the issue far better than i could. At worst you can accuse Rossi of capitalizing on the rules as they're written, but to be honest, thats racing, and always has been. The fact of the matter is that Marc rides without regard to other riders, he is of the mindset that the line is always his and anyone else needs to move out of the way for him, hes demonstrated numerous times at the end of races, if he's in 2nd the man in 1st is fair game. Rossi is one of the few who isnt afraid take Marc's script and flip it on him.   Hopefully he'll learn before he takes out another rider. Imagine the shitstorm if Rossi was on the really ragged edge of grip and Marcs bump lowsided him? I dont think Marc realizes just what kind of risk he's creating when he's trying to win."
motogp,3bhk48,from_dust,5,Mon Jun 29 14:14:54 2015 UTC,"For me it's Marc's stubborn position that his line was perfect despite cutting the corner himself that is annoying. Ok he's entitled to attack for the pass, but only if he's close enough to make it a clean one. He insists it was Rossi who made the dirty move of having the gall of being in the same space and then cut across the gravel. Videos show that he clearly would have ended up off track himself had Rossi not been there to take some of the braking load. If he keeps up this kind of attitude he's gonna lose not only fans, but respect in the paddock."
motogp,3bhk48,from_dust,2,Mon Jun 29 19:50:46 2015 UTC,"I think the paddock is already pretty clearly divided on this issue. Many of the younger riders have already had a taste of the Marquez Experience in Moto2, so it comes as no surprise, but yeah, if he doesnt learn to tamp down his sense of entitlement he will quickly find himself in a bad place mentally because everyone will dislike him"
motogp,3bhk48,Puppysmasher,3,Mon Jun 29 19:57:21 2015 UTC,"I think Lorenzo won't admit it publicly, but he's glad someone turned Marquez's style against him. He just probably prefers it wasn't his teammate that's also his main title rival.   EDIT: Support Rossi and it gives Rossi a better morale that his own teammate backs him up. Lorenzo certainly can't side with Honda and especially not with Marc."
motogp,3bhk48,cantpee,5,Mon Jun 29 20:00:47 2015 UTC,"Lorenzo handled that press conference like a boss. I'm surprised it's not considered unprofessional for journalists to ask questions that are incredibly stupid for anyone to answer.   I do imagine behind that smile of his, he was thinking that it's great to see Marc exposed as a sore loser and foolish rider. He's been saying it since Marc's rookie season. I also imagine that having been that way himself he's learned his lesson and is appreciating the wisdom of running a ""Lorenzo race"". For as boring as he may be to watch at times and for as awkward his personality can be, no one would ever consider him a dirty or underhanded rider."

motogp,3bhk48,Puppysmasher,3,Mon Jun 29 17:16:50 2015 UTC,"That was the thinking that had gone through my head. All the good will and fandom would evaporate in a heartbeat. And this is irrespective of the riders involved. If Lorenzo had been leading and Pedrosa were to take him out in the last corner with an overly aggressive move (i'm laughing even trying to picture Pedrosa doing that) he'd be vilified, and Lorenzo is one of the least liked people on the grid (deservedly or not, i think not).  Marc is finding the limits of his 'golden child' status, and i hope he sees that jeopardizing other peoples race isnt doing him any favors. People let it slide when he took out Bautista - that was working on good graces, but he's quickly gaining a reputation for being a bully on the track, only, there are bigger dogs in this pack.  In fairness, i can see how it would be easy to lose sight of the respect you should have for your fellow riders when your got back to back championship wins your first two seasons. he was cutting through the track like no one else, but things are different now."
motogp,3bhk48,cantpee,3,Mon Jun 29 17:24:38 2015 UTC,"All sentiments I agree with, fully.  I was livid when he took out Bautista in Qatar. It was a racing incident, surely. But it was only a racing incident because he forced it: there was not a gap, he created one by making Bautista stand the bike up in the middle of the turn.  JLo let him do his thing in 2013, but by mid point in the season, he was snapping back, hard. No one gives JLo enough credit as a fighter - he carries some ruthless block passes in his back pocket that he rarely pulls out in the GP class.   And with Rossi... Well, let's just say he has seen and done it all.  MM needs a bit of time to find out his true standing in this class. It's true he is very talented, but in this class, respect begets respect."
motogp,3bhk48,from_dust,4,Mon Jun 29 18:03:39 2015 UTC,"It's true he is very talented, but in this class, respect begets respect.   You see this with Iannone and Rossi. Iannone is a brawler but the two share mutual respect on the track. Their passes are typically pretty clean between the two.  MM needs to realize that punting a rider like Pedrosa is a lot different than a rider like Rossi. There are some scrappers he does not want to mix with, like Aleix, Iannone, Rossi, even Cal to an extent. Those guys won't hesitate to shove back and after witnessing his move in Assen, they aren't going to give him any graces. He is riding aggressive and getting away with it because other riders are being respectable. When he loses that respect the grid is going to become a lot more hostile.   Every rider on that grid has the skill to dive like MM, they just choose not to."

motogp,3bhk48,MT1982,4,Tue Jun 30 03:20:10 2015 UTC,"This is my thoughts exactly, MM was quite lucky to not bring down anyone (yet) in this championship   It wasn’t particularly strong contact, but it resulted in contact. Luckily the end result was that the positions stayed the same. If one or both had crashed as a result of that we’d have to look at the incident in the light of that, but luckily they didn’t"
motogp,3bhk48,from_dust,8,Mon Jun 29 09:29:19 2015 UTC,MM was quite lucky to not bring down anyone (yet) in this championship   He made Bautista retire at the opening round after riding into him.  Let's also not forget that if he hadn't knocked Pedrosa off at Aragon in 2013 Pedrosa could have possibly taken that title.
motogp,3bhk48,MT1982,2,Mon Jun 29 10:04:19 2015 UTC,"He's ran into Rossi twice now this season, luckily not causing either to crash with either incident.  I like Marquez though.  People were saying the same things about other riders in the past (Lorenzo in his 250 days, Simoncelli in 250/MotoGP, etc.), but eventually their heads leveled out and they backed off on that aggression a tiny bit.  To me it makes things interesting.  You have to remember that Marquez is still young, so he's still more apt to make boneheaded moves than someone with many more years of experience.  He'll get his shit sorted out eventually."

motogp,3bhk48,Myrelin,2,Mon Jun 29 14:32:35 2015 UTC,"Regarding Aragon - the touch itself wasn't what caused Pedrosa to crash, it was a faulty construction on the Honda that left sensors or something exposed and Marc clipped it. Unlucky, but he didn't actually knock Dani off the bike, the contact itself was small, wasn't it?  Don't get me wrong I'm not disputing that he's an aggressive rider - on top of which he also miscalculates moves often enough (he's done it twice with Rossi in just 8 races). But Rossi, especially when he was Marc's age wasn't that different. Sometimes it worked, other times it didn't. And he certainly pissed off a lot of other riders, too.   I will think Marc will calm down eventually; unfortunately I doubt it'll happen before he takes someone out. And that someone may just be one of the Yamaha guys. Going up against Rossi twice now and losing out might make him think some things over though. Maybe.  EDIT: Looked it up because it was bugging me, traction control cable at Aragon."
motogp,3bhk48,ross_rossifumi,3,Mon Jun 29 12:36:39 2015 UTC,"the touch itself wasn't what caused Pedrosa to crash, it was a faulty construction on the Honda that left sensors or something exposed and Marc clipped it.    That doesn't make any sense man.  That's like if a rider takes out another rider's front brake master cylinder and someone says ""it's Brembo's fault"".  That crash was entirely marc's fault. Adding extra protection is obviously a good idea but it's not a demolition derby out there."
motogp,3bhk48,Myrelin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:56:17 2015 UTC,"No of course it's not a demolition derby, but the contact itself wasn't big; to the point where the team wasn't even sure if there was contact in the first place. So calling it demolition derby is a little bit overkill. He went in too hot, yes. I wasn't disputing that. Rookie mistake. Literally.   But then again in a recent battle between Rossi and Dovi, Rossi left tyremarks on Dovi's leathers while passing him. It was a slight touch, nothing happened, no-one complained.  If at Aragon Marc didn't happen to accidently find the exact spot that fucked with the TC cable on Dani's bike, nothing would have happened.   And IIRC Honda were actually penalized for it."
motogp,3bhk48,from_dust,2,Mon Jun 29 13:08:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know it is a little bit of a stretch to say that Marquez took out Pedrosa, but the fact is that Marquez ran into the corner too hot, and clipped the back of Pedrosa, causing him to crash. Marquez was incredibly lucky that he didn't clip.Pedrosa's wheel and crash himself.  If the world was a fair place it would have been Marquez who crashed, and that title could have gone to Jorge or Dani."
motogp,3bhk48,Puppysmasher,1 point,Mon Jun 29 12:46:50 2015 UTC,"To me it is a stretch yes, but obviously it's just my opinion - the contact itself was absolutely unnecessary, Marc made a mistake. The crash though was unlucky. He didn't intentionally barge into Pedrosa in a last-corner move, he fucked up.   If the world was a fair place it would have been Marquez who crashed, and that title could have gone to Jorge or Dani.   It's not the first time a rookie clashed with another rider who was in the championship fight though. Most notably Dani himself, at Estoril in 2006. He nearly cost Nicky the title, by making a braking mistake. Unfortunately these things happen.   I'd love to go back and check out Rossi's first years in the premier class in detail but unfortunately they only have highlight videos available. I have a feeling (based on the fact that later on he still had plenty of questionable/aggressive moves) he had his fair share of mistakes.   And he made a similar one to Dani's in 2011 with Stoner at Jerez. On the inside, front washes out, down they go. But just like Marc's incident at Aragon, I'd classify these as mistakes which happen in racing.  What's more interesting to me is whether there is a trend. I'd be  curious to know if Marc is simply aggressive and thinks contact is a part of the game, or if he actually has some issues with situational/spatial awareness (not sure what to call it).   The way he argued his point in Assen was odd. He seemed to be utterly convinced that he was alongside Rossi, and that his line was perfect. And he even said that he didn't run off the track, which he did; he was in the grass after exit, and on the kerbs on entry.  I mean I don't know, but wouldn't you feel it if you ran through the kerbs and onto grass? Shouldn't you be aware of where the other rider is in a corner? I guess the simple answer would be that he just said those things without rhyme or reason, but that would be odd because there's plenty of evidence and easy to check.   Sorry, rambling. It's just a little strange, reminds me of Grosjean's first years in F1 where any race that didn't start with him taking out other drivers on the first lap was a lucky race."

I cant imagine anyone getting anywhere near this level of competition without impeccable spacial and situational awareness. Marc, more than most- has demonstrated his ability to ride on that razor thin limit between a fast lap and a high side. Remember that footage last year of him recovering his front end after completely washing out? No, i think Marc here is literally just remembering things differently than reality recorded them. Its not uncommon when the adrenaline is high and the tunnel vision sets in that peoples recollection of events doesnt mesh up with something as dispassionate as a helicopter camera.  Interesting, and tellingly, Marc has never commented on his own off track excursion there, he's only commented on Rossi's 'cut' of the corner. Marc seems incapable at the moment, of recognizing that his position on the inside of the corner does not entitle him to ""the racing line"" when another rider is objectively still in front of you. Yes, the line he practiced was a smart move and yes it was a perfect line, BUT its only perfect if there is no other rider in front of you. Thats where the hangup is.

motogp,3bhk48,Myrelin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:13:11 2015 UTC,"Apologies for the late reply, deadlines get in the way of my reddit time.   I absolutely agree that adrenaline (and emotions) running high can skew his view. But I did an incredibly long and rambly breakdown (which I'll mostly spare you from having to read) of both his and Rossi's comments after the race, and one of them managed to assess the situation very accurately, the other didn't. Every single comment and argument Marc made in the press conference could actually be picked apart, including  but certainly not limited to his claims that he was ""on the perfect line"".    Interesting, and tellingly, Marc has never commented on his own off track excursion there, he's only commented on Rossi's 'cut' of the corner.    He actually stated that he was in the right because he didn't run off track. Which again is a little strange, I would have thought running onto grass is something riders would feel.   But after watching the press conference several times, he made a response to a question that I think is the most telling and has gone largely unnoticed because he made many 'worse' ones during the press conference, but it directly goes against everything he argued regarding Rossi and against the belief that he is incapable of recognizing that being on the inside =/= being entitled to the racing line.   “My plan was go in on the first corner and then close the second one, because then the other rider don’t have the space and you have already the position.”   Right, so not only did he want to close the door on Rossi at the next turn - despite Rossi being on the inside line - but he also expected Rossi to back out of it.   I made a highly accurate and expert paint drawing of what Marc's plan was:  His entire plan revolved around being on the racing line for the second part of the chicane, with Rossi on his inside but not fully alongside him.  Here is a helpful illustration in gif format of  what Marc’s masterplan was for the second turn of the chicane:  He spent 20 minutes arguing and accusing Valentino of cheating - when his masterplan was a carbon copy of what happened. Only in his explanation of his plan, Valentino (on the inside) would have been forced to back out. In other words, he expected Valentino to back out of the same situation he threw himself into (with too much speed and at the wrong angle).   Which was followed by the question “If you were in Valentino’s situation wouldn’t you have done the same?” - to which he replied: “You never know, but now I know what I must do.”  He does know. Because his entire plan was to do much the same thing, only Valentino beat him to it. This is what irks me. It's one thing that adrenaline and emotions run high - but to not even recognize that the move he was planning for the whole weekend was turned around on him, and actually spend 20 minutes arguing something that he wanted to actually do is a little extreme.  By the time I realized what he was actually stating in this point, I was pretty amused (and started to feel quite bad for him). Either he honestly didn't realize that it was his move that Rossi pulled off on him (in which case I'm still not convinced about his awareness), or option b - that's exactly why he was so riled up in the press conference.   He mentioned so many times that his last corner was perfect, the last lap was perfect, he was calm during the race and carefully observed Rossi's lines (David Emmett has already gone over footage - apparently Rossi had the same line on the last chicane for the preceding laps), he was patient, he practiced that chicane all weekend long - I can't figure out what the relevance of this is. Frustration because he felt it was a wasted effort because Valentino beat him to it in the last chicane?   Ugh time for a TL;DR  Extreme TL;DR - Marc reveals in press conference that his plan was to do exactly the same move Rossi did to him, ie be on the racing line with Rossi on the inside but not fully alongside him, and then close the door on him - all in the second part of the chicane. Because suddenly inside line didn't matter anymore. Rossi beat him to it though."
motogp,3bhk48,ross_rossifumi,2,Tue Jun 30 08:43:31 2015 UTC,"Good points, all! I sincerely don't think Marc recognizes that Rossi flipped the script on him. I agree with you that is exactly what happened (as I've mentioned elsewhere) but I think Marc never prepared for ""what situation do I put another rider in after I make contact, what are their options and what do they do?"" Now the answer to that question may change from rider to rider, but if his answer is anything other than ""win"" when it comes to Rossi, that's a sore underestimation of the man."
motogp,3bhk48,Myrelin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:52:05 2015 UTC,"I sincerely don't think Marc recognizes that Rossi flipped the script on him.   That's pretty rough though (and a teeny tiny bit funny that he was arguing a point that he himself contradicted later on). On the one hand he seriously messed up in that press conference, on the other hand I can't help but feel bad for him. He's not having a great year bike-wise, and this probably just added fuel to the fire.   the answer to that question may change from rider to rider, but if his answer is anything other than ""win"" when it comes to Rossi, that's a sore underestimation of the man.   Perfectly put, I absolutely agree. It does feel like he underestimates Rossi a little bit - both in race craft and aggression. Not that I think Rossi did anything wrong in that final chicane, but Marc may have been able to bully another rider off the line without them closing the door."
motogp,3bhk48,oh84s,2,Tue Jun 30 16:06:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure about how aggressive Rossi was in his early days - I can remember he crashed quite a lot at the beginning of his first season, but I don't think he took anyone with him.  Once he got the hang of it races tended to be very similar - he'd stalk the leaders for most of the race, then with about 3 laps to go he'd casually pass them and blast out a couple of laps half a second quicker than anyone else.  It was when he was challenged by more equal riders that he started being aggressive - against Gibernau, then Stoner and Lorenzo. His status as the golden kid was being challenged, and he didn't like it - kind of like Marquez at the moment.  I think you make an interesting point about spatial awareness and Marquez - he does have a habit of running into the back of riders, though that may be because the Honda is unstable on the brakes.  And of course the Aragon incident was a racing incident, I just can't help but feel that it was so unfair that it was Pedrosa who suffered as a result."
motogp,3bhk48,Myrelin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:03:23 2015 UTC,"Not sure about how aggressive Rossi was in his early days - I can remember he crashed quite a lot at the beginning of his first season, but I don't think he took anyone with him.   This is exactly what I remember too (what a stunning debut!), him crashing all over the place - but wasn't sure about whether there was a lot of contact with other riders or not.   It was when he was challenged by more equal riders that he started being aggressive - against Gibernau, then Stoner and Lorenzo. His status as the golden kid was being challenged, and he didn't like it - kind of like Marquez at the moment.   Perhaps this is part of the answer. The problem is that Marc may be able to pull off this physical bullying on other riders, but Rossi sees it coming from miles away. If for no other reason than because he's done it himself in the past (as well as his fair share of boneheaded moves).   I think you make an interesting point about spatial awareness and Marquez - he does have a habit of running into the back of riders, though that may be because the Honda is unstable on the brakes.   Good point; it's hard to separate whether it's a bike or a Marc problem. It was this Assen press conference that just made me think, because I can't recall the last time I heard a rider or driver had such a vastly different view of what happened in the race. He was off on every single thing he said. There was a scenario that he imagined, how it would play out - and that's the story he told in the press conference, the trouble is that the actual events that took place were entirely different.   And of course the Aragon incident was a racing incident, I just can't help but feel that it was so unfair that it was Pedrosa who suffered as a result.   Oh I agree. I'm always quietly rooting for Dani, it was a damn shame that he went down. It's always such a close call with him, when it comes to him winning a title. He's had an incredible amount of bad luck and injuries over the years."

He had a few key incidents and he was fairly aggressive back then, but it was nothing like Marquez. Rossi just had normal incidents as a result of him passing riders, you never got the feeling he was going to try and throw a 50:50 move down the inside every single race like Marquez currently does.   One of these races I get the feeling he's going to take Rossi out on track, then he will face the shitstorm of the armies of Rossi fans."
motogp,3bhk48,kroatia04,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:58:27 2015 UTC,"Rossi just had normal incidents as a result of him passing riders, you never got the feeling he was going to try and throw a 50:50 move down the inside every single race like Marquez currently does.   To be fair, this is the first time Marc has serious issues with his bike. And he currently seems to lose his head when he's battling Rossi, which I suppose isn't that surprising; two aggressive riders battling it out is always going to lead to fireworks, and he looks like he wants to prove a point (though I have no idea what that is).  Rossi became more aggressive with time (and closer battles), it looks like it's the same for Marc. I'm not really counting his rookie year, because it was his rookie year. He made mistakes, and some hard overtakes but I don't think it was awful. He did manage to squeeze some hard overtakes into one season that Rossi spread out over several years of his career, but oh well.  His crashes or near-crashes this year remind me more of Rossi in 2011 (of which Jerez was a great/terrible example); still not really accepting that his bike won't do exactly what he wants it to, and becoming more aggressive because of it.   His move at Assen didn't look like it was going to work, and when Valentino ahead of him moved more to the outside before turning in he could have bailed, knowing Rossi would close the door (+ staying on the tighter entry line meant he was always going to be wide on exit, unless I'm misunderstanding something).   Instead it looks like he just decided to go for the lunge, and hope for the best/hope Rossi won't close the door.    One of these races I get the feeling he's going to take Rossi out on track, then he will face the shitstorm of the armies of Rossi fans.   If he takes out either of the title contenders, he'll be facing a lot more than the shitstorm of Rossi fans, I think. Especially if it's a boneheaded move.  I'm just keeping my fingers crossed he'll calm down a bit now or be more careful when he's battling Rossi, but I have a feeling that's just wishful thinking considering how resentful he seemed post-race.  EDIT: God I need to learn how to be concise, sorry Oh."
motogp,3bhk48,Bedeone,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:15:59 2015 UTC,"Rossi became more aggressive with time (and closer battles), it looks like it's the same for Marc.    I just find the more experienced riders can be aggressive and stay on the bike, while Marquez has a habit of going down when he does it. Has he actually taken anyone else out this year? I don't think so, so its kind of lucky in that regard. He's hit Rossi twice now but he went down in one instance and neither did in the second.  Tbh I can kind of relate to Marquez in that he thought Rossi just cut the course to win, he did. But I think given the circumstances it was very fair.   His crashes or near-crashes this year remind me more of Rossi in 2011 (of which Jerez was a great/terrible example); still not really accepting that his bike won't do exactly what he wants it to, and becoming more aggressive because of it.   Yeah Rossi did crash a lot in 2011 didn't he. I believe 3 races in a row wasn't it? A record for him (I sound knowledgeable on that because I just watched that season, I'm on holidays and have binge watched through 5 seasons in half a week).   Instead it looks like he just decided to go for the lunge, and hope for the best/hope Rossi won't close the door.   I think thats more likely. They can't always really plan the outcome, he just put his bike there and hoped it would make something happen. The thing is Marquez could have finished second and shown he was the back pace wise, but he felt the need to go to that lengths.   If he takes out either of the title contenders, he'll be facing a lot more than the shitstorm of Rossi fans, I think. Especially if it's a boneheaded move.   It seems like an inevitability at this point, but having said that I still don't think he's crashed out another rider yet has he? It will be a big deal, because it looks like a non finish could seal this title. Lorenzo and Rossi seem very evenly matched and the one that throws away 25 points will likely be the one that loses. As Marquez will be battling for the win a lot of the time they will have to take this into consideration."

And Marquez is inexperienced (relatively) and thought he could squeeze by (although Rossi is like a machine when it comes to taking exact lines, so he must have known it wouldn't work). All in all, Rossi was in front the whole time and Marquez seemed to be going way too fast anyway. I'm a fan of both of them, but the response by Marquez was disappointing. The guy isn't strategic with his riding. This season he's crashed too many times due to unforced errors."

This is because he pushed a rider off the racing line who was ahead. However because Rossi cut the corner no advantage was gained and they came out of the corners just as they came in.  I understand Pol's thought process, that you can't just lunge up the inside and use the other rider as a cushion, but the rules are already in place to stop that."
motogp,3bht0b,KICKERMAN360,2,Mon Jun 29 12:22:27 2015 UTC,"I still agree with Pol though. It wouldn't be acceptable on lap 5 to do that, so why is is acceptable on the last lap? Motorsport isn't a contact sport. Sure, there are times where a nudge is acceptable on two closely matched competitors, but Marquez's angle to Rossi was just too high. It was almost a T-bone on Rossi. And even if Rossi then crashed and Marquez won, who's to say Rossi would have still had 2nd? Fight a fair fight is all I'm saying. I like Rossi and Marquez, but Marquez needs to mature as a rider. Most of why he is so far behind is because of his own mistakes. He needs to learn that 2nd and 3rd are acceptable. Just like how Rossi has done over the years."

motogp,3bfs13,GingerHero,30,Sun Jun 28 20:57:39 2015 UTC,"Aggression is definitely fun to watch but no one likes to see someone lose a race because of another riders mistake. He almost took out Lorenzo pretty recently and the incident from last weekend could have easily resulted in a DNF for one/both of them.   I think the issue is that week after week we watch Rossi, Lorenzo, crutchlow, dovi etc have exciting battles without appearing to get close to taking other riders out, whereas Marquez just always seems to be on the cusp of either crashing himself or into someone else.   And of course a selfish point but relevant nonetheless - I'd much rather watch a 25 lap battle than a 5 lap battle, then a crash and then a boring race. I think for Marquez to be considered on the same level as his current competitors (long term) he needs to show he can battle for a race distance without making us all pray to the high heavens!"
motogp,3bfs13,Bretty_boy,7,Sun Jun 28 21:36:43 2015 UTC,This makes a lot of sense to me. Thanks for the thought out reply.

motogp,3bfs13,el_loco_avs,4,Sun Jun 28 21:40:55 2015 UTC,Oh definitely the team would be better off with a rider that consistently finishes top 3 instead of winning half and crashing half!
motogp,3bfs13,gnualmafuerte,-2,Mon Jun 29 02:07:46 2015 UTC,Rossi and Dani and those guys have taken out guys often enough themselves.
motogp,3bfs13,NotNotLitotes,15,Mon Jun 29 14:16:00 2015 UTC,"An aggressive maneuver is fine, but you have to draw the line somewhere. Bringing rocks and throwing them at other riders is not an aggressive maneuver. Kicking other riders is not a valid maneuver, and neither is touching their killswitch.   In the same way, MM's ""If I don't win, neither will you"" attitude is not fine either. When MM was chasing Rossi, we still didn't know who was going to win. When MM passed Rossi for the first time, the race wasn't defined yet. At the last chicane, when Rossi was already into the turn, the race was already over. So MM decided to stop riding, and just go get him.   He threw the bike into him, hitting him and running him off track, in a way that was also dangerous to himself, as he was not able to take the chicane properly. There were only two outcomes to MM's maneuver: Either Rossi crashed, or he miraculously saved the bike. The most likely outcome (46 crashing) could have caused one of two things: Either MM crashed with him, or Race Direction heavily penalized 93.   There was NO POSSIBLE SCENARIO in which he could've passed Rossi at that chicane and won the race. Not one. And actions that jeopardize others while gaining no advantage for yourself have indisputably no place in MotoGP."
motogp,3bfs13,gnualmafuerte,3,Mon Jun 29 00:37:04 2015 UTC,"Good post, although I disagree with your last comment. I think there are a couple of scenarios in which he could have made the pass at the chicane and won the race:   If he had had some extreme, one in a million ""act of god"" that kept the bike together, his bike in front of Rossi's, a la Schwantz at Hockenheim If Rossi had gone wide on a defensive, late braking line Or if he had tried that on a rider who wasn't at Rossi's level when it comes to very physical, tight racing. Would it work on Simoncelli? Lol definitely not. Lorenzo? Unlikely. Pedrosa? Getting more into the realms of possibility... and so on and so forth.   So I think it could have worked, but he had some balls to try that sort of move on Rossi, who pretty much invented it."
motogp,3bfs13,NotNotLitotes,2,Mon Jun 29 06:42:15 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely. That was precisely my point: That move in that particular turn, in the last few meters of the race, already into the turn, and directed at not other than the doctor himself? A recipe for disaster."
motogp,3bfs13,el_loco_avs,4,Mon Jun 29 06:47:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah but as slim a chance as he had, Rossi's history sort of invites people to give these moves a shot. I do wonder if he'd even try and pull off something like that against Pedrosa or anyone.  Ok it's MM so he probably would, but I can see Lorenzo giving it a try against Rossi but not against Pedrosa in that same situation."
motogp,3bfs13,Deacon46,2,Mon Jun 29 06:54:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah. My issue with all the complaints is that ROSSI is the one that started this business years ago. And now he's got riders on his level, and people start complaining suddenly? It's just pathetic to me.  Rossi isn't complaining though, I still love him, but his fans are pissing me off."
motogp,3bfs13,el_loco_avs,3,Mon Jun 29 14:17:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think the fans are angry because it is Rossi. They are angry because this is another case of Marquez making contact with another rider. It happens far too often. This was for the win at the last corner, of course people would talking about it regardless of who Marquez made the move on."

motogp,3bfs13,gnualmafuerte,3,Mon Jun 29 01:03:12 2015 UTC,"Lots of people. They said he was too aggressive. To be honest, I don't think the kind of aggression Rossi shows is the same kind that MM shows. As I said, it's the difference between constructive aggression and simple tantrums. Rossi took a lot of risks, and did a lot of very aggressive passes, and that made many riders and fans uncomfortable, but he never threw a tantrum like MM does. If he couldn't make first, he would pull back and be happy to finish second, third, or at least to finish at all. I think that's what MM needs to learn. He's lucky to have finished second in Assen. He could've crashed like he did already 3 times this season, or could've been penalized heavily by race direction."
motogp,3bfs13,dustyshelves,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:36:53 2015 UTC,"Too bad, the competition at that level is so high your think you could only get there by being calculated but the stories I keep reading about him and the vids I've been watching just prove your point to me."
motogp,3bfs13,gnualmafuerte,6,Mon Jun 29 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's anything to worry about. All riders have gone through a crisis at one point or another. MM's crisis comes from expectations and a natural tendency to be capricious. He started way too hot, and people started calling a 20 year old that had just won his first MotoGP championship ""the greatest rider of all times"". He was complete sure that he was the best, that he was absolutely unbeatable. So he went out there every race, got pole, then rode alone the entire race. Truth is, while he is an amazingly skilled rider, and certainly one of the best, he is not unbeatable, he is not perfect, and he has a lot of competition. Last few seasons the Yamahas weren't as fast, Rossi wasn't in his best moment, Lorenzo is unstable, so based on how he feels that day he might be very fast or very slow, the Ducatis were slower than they are now, Suzuki wasn't even in the picture .... a lot of things contributed to his winning streak. This season, Yamaha and Ducati put out very competitive machines, Rossi is in a great moment, Lorenzo had one of his awakenings, and to top it off, Honda rushed a new model that had a lot of quirks, and having to demand more of the bike to stay competitive against the Yamahas and Ducatis, brought to light a lot of other issues the Honda had, and exacerbated the issues of the 2015 frame. So suddenly MM is not the Messiah anymore, he's been show that he is just another mortal rider, albeit a very skilled one, with the potential to be at the top constantly. He could've accepted this, and he would've had a good session. He could've finished every race in or close to the podium, and would be closer to Lorenzo and Rossi. Instead, his whimsical self got the best of him, he rejected the idea that he is not unbeatable, and threw ridiculous tantrums one after the other.   In any case, in this race he has shown a lot more restrain than in the previous ones (Argentina and Catalunya, for example), which is a good indicator. Next session he will be better. And if he calms down and understands that he can't win every time, and starts to ignore the expectations that have been put on him and instead just race, he will go on to break a lot of records and get on the MotoGP hall of fame as one of the best riders we've ever seen on the tarmac."
motogp,3bfs13,el_loco_avs,2,Mon Jun 29 02:03:10 2015 UTC,"I do agree that he has shown a lot more restrain, but his insistent comment about how he has been studying Rossi's line and has practiced how and where to put his bike at that last chicane, that he had done the perfect lap, etc, makes me feel like he wants to get credit for it? Or not credit, more like, he wants to must get rewarded for it. Like.. he knew it was very uncharacteristic of him to wait that long before making a move, and he had been waiting for 20+ laps, and all that waiting would not go to waste.   Which I suppose is understandable, everyone wants to get rewarded for being out of their comfort zone (in his case: showing restrain for once) but it's annoying immature nonetheless, and it just adds to the hot mess that is his post-race attitude."
motogp,3bfs13,tekkentool,3,Mon Jun 29 05:08:38 2015 UTC,"We have a guy in Argentina, you might have heard of Maradona. He is an asshole, but he probably was once the most skilled soccer player (I couldn't tell, I'm one of the few Argentinians who doesn't like soccer). In any case, he was undoubtedly very skilled, and was considered a god by most fans, the expectations placed on him by the media, the fans, his family, an entire soccer-crazed country behind him told him that he was god and he had to be a hero for all of them. Then proceeded to give him insane constant attention, and unimaginable piles of money. And he was just a kid.   So he turned into the most insufferable cunt you could imagine. Even though he was probably the best or one of the best on the field every time, the other 11 players on the other team were skilled professionals too, so he couldn't win everything every time. He started to get aggressive, and break the rules. Then drugs, alcohol, whores and blow every night. He blew it, he failed, he never reached his full potential. He retired early, a fat loser.   Of course, MM is not that guy. He doesn't come from a poor ignorant family in SA, he's had access since he was a kid to things Maradona could never dream of, and of course he's not just wasting it away on blow.   But there is a similarity, he was raised by his family to be on a bike, and they've surely put enormous effort on him to succeed. Of course, this is true of many riders, certainly Rossi, the Espargaro brothers, they were all raised to ride, but it doesn't affect everyone in the same way. Also, I haven't seen such a reaction to a new rider ever. Rossi was a young promise, this guy was the Messiah as soon as he touched the Tarmac. He went from being just a kid to being god in a few months. And he just couldn't handle it.   So, when you hear him say that kind of stuff, of course he's justifying himself, and trying to get merit. You could smell his desperation to win in Argentina, in Mugello, in Catalunya, in Assen. He got a very stern talking to from Honda, probably telling him to stay cool, race till the end, and stop crashing. Telling him to be conservative and focus on finishing before winning. And on the other ear his ego, telling him he had to win every race. And the memory of his father's voice telling him he was the best, and spending all that money to get him racing since he was a kid.   It's hard to bear that load on your back all the time, specially at a time when your own bike is having issues, and everybody else's bike is more competitive than ever.   I've gotten a lot of downvotes for criticizing him, but I seriously like his riding, and I hope he can fix his attitude so he can continue being a top rider."
motogp,3bfs13,dadozzz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:24:31 2015 UTC,"Oh wow. I certainly hope MM doesn't turn out like him. I'm a soccer / football fan, but I'm too young to know much about Maradona about him at his prime. I've heard and read countless praises for him ofc, but the Maradona I know is the Maradona now: like you said, a retired, overweight asshole who has way too much money and time and seemingly way too little appreciation of them. I maybe should have used kinder words since the guy just lost his father, but I don't really care about or respect him enough to bother.  I agree with you. I suppose everyone who has such enormous success so early in their career are bound to have an attitude / ego problem of sorts. You bringing up Maradona makes me think of Messi - arguably the best player in the world and he seems like a nice guy but he definitely has an ego, and how can he not? He's had teams built around him. New players have to change their style to fit his. This far into his career, having proven himself year after year, he knows he has this power over people. Anyone will have the same problem. I guess this is one of the reasons people love Rossi so much. He seems to be able to dodge this bullet.  I, too, hope MM can fix his attitude bc anything else would be such a shame! He says Rossi is someone he looks up to so I hope he really does that. He really has almost everything it takes to be a sporting legend."
motogp,3bfs13,tekkentool,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:53:20 2015 UTC,Woah. Interesting and super insightful counterpoint. Can't wait to see what happens next race. It's always interesting to watch the interviews with the riders to see if they let slip that they are this introspective as you've been at examining him.
motogp,3bfs13,ross_rossifumi,2,Mon Jun 29 04:45:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I've found it interesting to catch interviews with the riders in their original languages. Lorenzo/Marquez/Rossi don't have a great grasp of English, they have troubles with problems with pronunciation, and generally get sort of nervous when Speaking in English, so those interviews are generally limited to repeating a few well practiced phrases. Spanish is my native language, and I understand Italian (I can't really speak it, but I understand most of what's being said, having an Italian grandfather, and Italian sharing a lot of vocabulary with other romance languages), and I can tell you they are different people when they speak in their native languages. Even Lorenzo doesn't sound like a complete Robot in Spanish.   But, really, you'll get more from their actions on the track than from the interviews, they are all very well coached, and limit their press interactions to what they know they can say. Remember when Rossi speaks, he speaks for Yamaha, Movistar, Dorna, and other huge multinational corporations, he can't really say everything he's thinking."

He just has a little bit of an arrogant attitude at the moment, and is unable to admit he was wrong.  But that's OK - Rossi was like that at his age, and no-one can really deny that his last corner move on Gibernau at Jerez was out of order.   He'll mature in time, I've just realised he's not as mature as I hoped."
motogp,3bfs13,jimbodeeny,4,Sun Jun 28 21:24:06 2015 UTC,"I recently watched Fastest and Rossi was frequently accused of being incredibly aggressive, but calculated.   Do you think Marquez was wrong to go for it? Rossi took the wide line probably knowing he would try and dive in...."
motogp,3bfs13,El_Bard0,4,Sun Jun 28 21:30:39 2015 UTC,"Well, Marquez was definitely too far behind Rosi to make it work, but this was the last corner, and the adrenaline must have been flowing - to say he was wrong may be going a little bit too far.  Sure more sensible riders like Dani or Dovi wouldn't have done it, but they're not champions in motogp. At MM's age Rossi definitely would have done it."

Even more annoying is see the camera cut away to his brother and father crying foul in the paddock as well."
motogp,3bfs13,Daniel7394,7,Mon Jun 29 22:06:19 2015 UTC,"He has a history of riding dangerously and was penalised heavily for it when he was in moto2. He has caused a few accidents since moving up, most notably the one where he clipped his teammate Dani and knackered his traction control sensor.  I enjoy watching him ride, especially when he is loose and backing it in or entering corners with the back wheel off the ground but if he carries on with stupid overtakes like he has been recently I don't think it will be long before he either hurts someone or knocks them off and loses someone the race."
motogp,3bfs13,Myrelin,3,Sun Jun 28 22:27:06 2015 UTC,"I like that he tries but it just feels like Marc is aware that he will hit the other rider, and thinks it's fine to do so, as it's the last lap/corner. Other riders may try a risky move but they would not try it if they were 100% certain they would hit another rider, like Marc was at the last corner in Assen, or when he hit Rossi in Argentina, or Lorenzo in Jerez, or Pedrosa in Aragon, or Espargaro in Catalunya, or Bautista in Qatar..."

His only wheelie was that short. Stoner on the other hand had no issues with getting his old race bike on one wheel

motogp,3be253,oh84s,19,Sun Jun 28 10:02:21 2015 UTC,The most apparent is body position. Rossi came from old school 500cc whereas Stoner was the first of the young sharks to hang off a bit more. The other one that made Stoner extremely fast is his ability to ride the bike the best way it can be around the track. Some say Stoner rides around a bike's limitations. Others say he's able to squeeze out a bike's potential in most corners.   Rossi 2006 body position  Stoner 2006 in his rookie year  The most famous example of Stoner riding differently from the rest of the grid is on his home track. Where as everyone took a traditional attack at turn 3 (now named Stoner Corner) he slides his rear which allows him a few tenths advantage every lap.  Here he is in 2011 sliding out of the turn
motogp,3be253,YamahaRN,3,Sun Jun 28 10:42:12 2015 UTC,"Awesome, great post.  I finally got around to buying a MotoGP.com past so I can go and watch some older seasons. I'll keep an eye out for what you mean on track.  What you described is more or less how I see Marquez riding the bike (a lot of body lean and very unsettled rear)."
motogp,3be253,YamahaRN,3,Sun Jun 28 11:13:51 2015 UTC,"Marc likes to move around the rear on corner entry to get the bike pointed better before the apex. Stoner likes to get the rear moving on the way out and likes to get the bike pointed better midcorner.   Marc doesn't lean over the most with his body, but he's definitely top 3. Redding hangs off the most which is mostly due to his sheer size compared  to the rest of the grid."
motogp,3be253,YamahaRN,-3,Sun Jun 28 12:01:52 2015 UTC,"Redding hangs off the most which is mostly due to his sheer size compared to the rest of the grid.   I guess its only useful if you can generate lap time with that style. Riding over the limit like any form of motorsports is usually slower, its impressive when they can do it and generate lap time with it.   Redding has been fairly poor this year imo, barely ahead of the Open Honda bikes."
motogp,3be253,SellMeSomeSleep,4,Sun Jun 28 12:03:52 2015 UTC,"I agree body position isn't everything for track success, but at this level it's definitely a prerequisite.  I think he's too concerned with getting the bike dialed-in with regards to the electronics. He ends up trying so many settings he never gets a comfortable feeling. He should do what Cal did with the GP14 and do very little adjustments with the electronics and ride the damn bike."

motogp,3be253,McNorch,2,Sun Jun 28 15:39:07 2015 UTC,"500cc drifting is much different to stoner's drifting, randy mamola and all that were just spinning up the bike on the exit, casey stoner slides both the front and the rear wheels on corner ENTRY too and barely does it on the exit (as that would mean less traction)."

motogp,3be253,YamahaRN,7,Sun Jun 28 14:46:19 2015 UTC,"Stoner himself answers that he really loves the rear of the bike moving around. He came from dirt speedways and honed the technique of sliding when he transitioned onto the hard stuff. He uses it both to maintain higher exit speeds and to adjust his line mid corner which traditionally would be down by lifting or a dab of rear brake.  Rossi is a traditionalist with perfect lines, tyre management, late braking overtakes.  Marquez is similar to Stoner in that he likes the bike to move around, except it's under braking/entry/on the front wheel and he was the 'first' to take that area to another level.  I picture a battle between them as a never ending loop of Marquez making a crazy slide down the inside then Stoner nabbing it back by sliding the whole way around the outside on exit."

I didn't think there was anything that wrong with his move. It was reckless, but we've seen the same thing many times before.  The issue more seems to be how frequently Marquez is doing that kind of thing. Once is just a move, but regularly is a reputation."
motogp,3be253,MikeD270,3,Sun Jun 28 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"Rossi and Marc are both fierce competitors and both have a reputation of not shying away from contact. Rossi just seems to be a bit more calculated with it, or makes it looks that way because he usually has the favorable outcome."
motogp,3be253,0dder0tter,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:57:55 2015 UTC,"Really? Maybe, but if he would have, it would have been that he was counting on MM binning it in the gravel due to his relative lack of experience. Vale would have known knocking MM offline would let him shortcut the gravel trap.   Given Vale's superior corner speed, he may have tried to slam the door on Mark on the second corner of the chicane. Even if he couldn't slam the door, he may have been able to unsettle MM enough to make a drag to the line possible.  Too bad we can't flip through MotoGP.com from other places in the multiverse."

No idea what you're talking about here. That's definitely not something I've said, nor anything I've ever heard Rossi say. Rossi overcooked it, all on his own.   Contrast that, however, to the last corner wipeout that Stoner had a few laps later. Like Rossi in the Corkscrew, Stoner overcooked it all by his own hand (his ambition was greater than his talent, I guess), but to hear Stoner tell it it was Rossi's fault for ""brake-checking""."

motogp,3bcnnw,ExquisiteFacade,12,Sun Jun 28 04:02:32 2015 UTC,I think you have to put this move into perspective of the bigger picture.   MM tried a stunt that served only one purpose and that was to rattle VR. Marc did not need to win this race and the person leading the race is leading the championship. So far in his career Marc has showed himself to be inferior in the mental game versus Rossi.   When you get down to it Rossi has learned a very valuable lesson that he is mentally stronger in every way over MM. It would have been much better for Marc to stay tight to Rossi's bike to the end and place 2nd from a mental aspect. Rossi has said post race that he was at the limit of himself and the bike and still couldn't shake Marc.  Knowing this if Marc kept his position without that move  I believe it would have had more of a mental impact on Rossi. As the race ended Marc ended up looking desperate and with that move Rossi saw Marc had nothing else for him.  Rossi now knows that even on Marc's best day he can match him over a race distance. This is a very strong lesson to learn as a racer and probably the first time we have seen Rossi and Marc go a complete Race so closely matched in pace.  If I have learned anything from watching Valentino over the years it is that first you beat their mind then you beat them on track. If Marc can elevate to this mentality I really think this is the missing piece to him being the next great racer of our lifetimes.   But the desperate last corner moves like this is not going to rattle Rossi. Marc's only option is out right pace at this point.
motogp,3bcnnw,jamestrainwreck,11,Sun Jun 28 01:04:36 2015 UTC,Marc has showed himself to be inferior in the mental game versus Rossi.   No one has ever been able to play the mental game like Rossi. I'm not sure anyone ever will.

motogp,3bcnnw,ross_rossifumi,6,Sun Jun 28 00:59:43 2015 UTC,"Oh, indeed. When MM first passed him, I said ""VR is gonna be back in front within a few laps. This is what he does. He's been going from the back of the line to the podium the entire season"". When he did, it was such a clean, beautiful, elegant pass, I just went nuts."
motogp,3bcnnw,bravo_company,2,Sun Jun 28 01:05:24 2015 UTC,That was absolutely world-class bike- and race-craft. It doesn't get any better!
motogp,3bcnnw,Karl_Vos,13,Mon Jun 29 01:59:13 2015 UTC,"About point 3- first of all, I agree totally with race direction, Rossi was ahead all the way through, no advantage gained/lost, racing incident, end of story.  But the point I want to make is that I don't think Marquez was wrong for trying. I've seen a lot of people saying how reckless he was, and that he should have learned not to do things like this; bullshit. This is racing. Marc put in a hell of a last lap, and he was close enough to try it.  If Rossi was in second, you can bet your ass he would have stuck it up the inside.  Yes, Marc was whining after the race, (it's easy to forget he's only 22) and I think maybe once he's calmed down, he'll see the sense in race direction's decision. But don't knock him for trying!"
motogp,3bcnnw,Fight_Jeff,4,Sun Jun 28 00:13:05 2015 UTC,"he was close enough to try it.    But he wasn't!  Marquez went in so deep he went off track too. Rossi was too far ahead of Marquez and already committed to the corner and Marquez just pushed him off the track.  To be fair though this was no different to Rossi's move on Gibernau at Jerez, so before we all board the Marquez-hate bandwagon, let's remember that Rossi has pulled some dick moves at Marquez' age too."
motogp,3bcnnw,Myrelin,4,Sun Jun 28 07:34:33 2015 UTC,"The thing is Marquez has constantly used his bike as a battering ram to pass others. Lorenzo his first year, tried it with Rossi in Argentina, even back when he was in moto 2. There was no way in hell he was going to make that corner today at those speeds without bumping Rossi. What would have happened if Rossi had crashed out at the gravel at Marquez won? 25 sec penalty for Marquez? There's a difference between trying and in control and recklessly trying."
motogp,3bcnnw,bansheeben,5,Sun Jun 28 00:29:37 2015 UTC,Yeah and Rossi never hit gibernau or stoner...
motogp,3bcnnw,Fight_Jeff,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:33:26 2015 UTC,"Not gonna deny that Marquez has crossed the line previously, he's put in far more aggressive passes than this one.   I just don't think this one was anywhere near as severe as some are making out- he stuck it up the inside, and had a small slide as he approached the apex. Yes he was going to run deep, but how many times do you see riders run it deep into the corner when going up the inside- it happens all the time. On an earlier lap, it might have been a block pass. Because it was the last lap, Rossi held his line, and came out on top.   But Marc had to try- as I said, Rossi would have done exactly the same thing. That's why they're the two most exciting riders to watch, and I wouldn't have it any other way."
motogp,3bcnnw,Fist_Adventures,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:57:08 2015 UTC,"No, Rossi wouldn't have tried the same thing. That's why Rossi finished every race in the season so far IN THE PODIUM. The closest is Lorenzo with 5 out of 8.   Marquez does this kind of thing, consistently, that's why this season he has 3 DNFs, and only 3 podiums.   If Rossi thinks he can win, he will try to win. If he can't, he'll get conservative, pull back, and finish in the best possible position. He already said that specifically twice in this season."
motogp,3bcnnw,slinkysuki,3,Sun Jun 28 01:14:00 2015 UTC,"If Rossi thinks he can win, he will try to win.   To be fair though, throughout the race - based on how he talked about in the press conference - Marc felt that he can win, too. He felt that it was all going according to plan, he even specifically practiced his cornering at the last chicane.   I think the problem is that ""this is how I imagined it would happen/this is how I did it while alone on the track"" is a far cry from how it actually played out. As someone perfectly put it in another thread - Valentino's bike wasn't were Marc expected it to be. It's all well and good to run through scenarios and make plans, but he needs to be able to adjust for what's actually unfolding in front of him.   His bike had a strange wobble before he took the dive into the chicane, and at that point you could already see that Rossi isn't going to leave the door open. He could have pulled out of the manoeuvre at the last second. He would have gone wide probably and lost some time - but it wouldn't have mattered, he'd still have had second place.   But all the above reasoning only matters if he had actually reached the conclusion that he can't win this. And apparently, he never got there. And of course what he didn't factor into his calculations is that Rossi's not an idiot, and he's got a good read on Marc. He wasn't going to leave the door open, and he sure as hell wasn't going to back off the racing line, while he was in the lead.   I think Marc's problem is youthful arrogance (and let's not forget he won two world championships, the first in his rookie year), and lack of experience when it comes to evaluating his chances. He also seems to underestimate Rossi, and I'm not sure why.   In contrast, as you said - if Rossi thinks he can win, he will try. His pass to retake the lead from Marc was beautiful (and clean). He knew he could get it done, and he did. But he has 20 years of GP experience and past situations to help him in his situational awareness and evaluations. Marc just needs a little more time.  And to learn when to keep his mouth shut, regardless of how frustrated he is."
motogp,3bcnnw,Fight_Jeff,2,Sun Jun 28 02:17:53 2015 UTC,"I think Marc's problem is youthful arrogance   It's one hundred percent this. I have said it several times even in this very thread, time will humble him a bit, and if that cools him down a bit, and he gains some consistency, he will become very hard to beat."

motogp,3bcnnw,dustyshelves,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:44:51 2015 UTC,this is the correct attitude towards this situation.
motogp,3bcnnw,_Lo2W_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:52:43 2015 UTC,"But don't knock him for trying!   Look at my flair, anyone that likes VR likes aggressive riding. But there is a difference between aggressively trying to pass someone and just attacking riders. You can put a rider in a position to ""let me through or crash"", we've seen VR do it all the time. But that's not what happened here. MM just threw his bike sideways into VR, hitting him right in the middle, when he was already into the chicane, mere meteres from the finish line, on the last fucking lap. That is not an aggressive pass, that's just pushing someone off the track. There is no difference between what #93 did and just intentionally kicking someone's front end. I've said it over and over again: What makes VR so incredible is that he's a squid. He takes risks, rides aggressively, and is not afraid of the rain, not afraid of the gravel, and not afraid of a little contact in the sport.   MM wasn't just being squidish, he was throwing the same tantrum that he threw in his crash behind Rossi in Argentina, and his crash behind Lorenzo in Catalunya. If I can't pass you, I'll just throw my bike at you and we'll both crash. In all three occasions, he FAILED. Twice he crashed without takin anyone out. This last time, he only managed to not crash by a frog's hair. Imagine if he crashed, it would've been his 3rd DNF in a row. What if he crashed and took VR out too (it could've easily happened)? You wouldn't be saying the same thing."
motogp,3bcnnw,keoke916,3,Sun Jun 28 00:39:44 2015 UTC,"The deciding moment for me was seeing MM run wide, off the track, just after that contact. There's no way he was going to get that bike stopped enough to make it through the chicane, even without ramming Rossi. To me, that says it wasn't a clever decision, and it wasn't a sportsmanlike move."

motogp,3bcnnw,YamahaRN,-1,Sun Jun 28 01:15:08 2015 UTC,"One thing though, the crash in catalunya didn't affect anyone else- why are you mad at him for that?   Because it barely didn't affect anyone else. The way he went at him, he could've rammed into Lorenzo and take him out too.   And also because I like MM. I criticize him, but look at some of my comments in this thread, I also call him the best rider ever besides VR. When he finally grows up and gains some experience, if he cools down a bit, he'll be very very hard to beat. I'd like to see him compete at the top, but this tantrums make that impossible. And that's what they are, tantrums. If he doesn't get what he wants when he wants it, then it's the end of the race for him, he just kicks the board. He's that one kid we all knew that when things didn't go his way, just took the ball and went home."
motogp,3bcnnw,backwards01,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:26:54 2015 UTC,"In Catalunya, he said he saw that when he lost his bike it was too dangerous for him and Lorenzo if he chose to go into the corner anyway so he went wide instead. I mean, hey, I guess.. he actually thinks about these things too!  I want to see this as a good thing, but I don't know if that makes his actions better or worse. Does that mean other times he did crazy shit he knew the risk and was like ""Fuck it"" and did it anyway? Has he actually ever seriously injured anyone but himself with his crazy stunts, btw? I'm not super familiar with his pre-motogp days."
motogp,3bcnnw,ExquisiteFacade,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:02:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's learned anything, I'm sure if he was able to get the inside line on that turn instead of being outside Lorenzo he would have used Lorenzo as a bumper car to slow himself down . He has an amazing reserve of talent, but he's not just aggressive, he's a dangerous rider, and unless he stars using that head in his helmet he's going to seriously injure himself or someone else. In the 8 rounds this season he has hit 3 riders during races, and narrowly missed Lorenzo at Catalunya.   I've never been a fan of Marquez but I respect his talent and he could be the rider to step into Vales shoes  when he retires, I just don't want to see what seems inevitable, him ending his or someone elses career. What he's lacking most is professionalism and respect for the other people on the grid."
motogp,3bcnnw,ExquisiteFacade,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:58:00 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of people say that about him (he's not just aggressive, he's dangerous) and even as his fan, it's very hard to deny that. I really hope that he's actually smarter than he seems, because, please correct me if I'm wrong, it doesn't look like he's actually seriously injured anyone else but himself, right? So maybe he does calculate the risk before doing a crazy overtake or, like ppl in this sub like to put it: ""ramming his bike into someone else"", but yeah.. lol, even for his fan that sounds like desperate, wishful thinking.  What worries me most is he has actually had a couple of accidents that almost ended his career, that would have been seen as major wake up calls by any other riders, but he just keeps going the same way he's ever gone. I just really hope that time will take care of his immaturity, and he can properly grow up before it ever comes down to those seemingly inevitable things you mentione."
motogp,3bcnnw,slinkysuki,-3,Sun Jun 28 16:49:17 2015 UTC,Agree 100%. I reckon Rossi would've tried something on that last chicane if he was in MM's position (although I'm sure Rossi fanboys will disagree)
motogp,3bcnnw,YamahaRN,2,Sun Jun 28 02:03:05 2015 UTC,"Indeed. And it's just what he did, but how. It was one seamless move, like he just and practiced getting pushed into the gravel mid-chicane,  like he intended the entire maneuver since he left the pits. And after the race? He just went and happily shaked MM's hand. He was just almost run off the track by Marquez after leading for 95% of the race, and he wasn't even mad. No stoner-like ego-talent witty comment, no 93 or 99 style tantrum, just a wide smile.   All in the game, yo"

I don't think Vale is in the wrong btw, but I feel like it's understandable for Marc, a young rider, to feel that way minutes after the race / battle, when he's still full of adrenaline and haven't completely had the time to calm down and watch the replays and think straight yet."

motogp,3b9f6r,YamahaRN,2,Sat Jun 27 14:38:29 2015 UTC,Any driver would've said that before seeing the footage. Rossi inculded.
motogp,3b9f6r,Ehralur,5,Sat Jun 27 17:50:33 2015 UTC,"It was a line.. literally! :D Great finish, I hope the race directors won't penalise him."

motogp,3b9f6r,lentife,15,Sat Jun 27 12:42:22 2015 UTC,My heart dropped at the contact between MM and VR... Damn that was close!
motogp,3b9f6r,AdamR46,3,Sat Jun 27 12:43:27 2015 UTC,"so did mine, then I jumped up off the couch and probably woke up my girlfriend.. fuck yeah!"
motogp,3b9f6r,Sayers133,11,Sat Jun 27 13:10:18 2015 UTC,Marc's bike looks a LOT more composed and settled
motogp,3b9f6r,mavam,15,Sat Jun 27 12:09:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, Marc is passing this as Vale's fault and getting bitchy about creating a touch between them. Marc. The king of ramming it into other people."
motogp,3b9f6r,mavam,8,Sat Jun 27 12:52:59 2015 UTC,Marc is going to try something I swear to God he better make it clean.
motogp,3b9f6r,RC211V,8,Sat Jun 27 12:27:58 2015 UTC,That beautiful italian anthem.
motogp,3b9f6r,CatsHaveWings,8,Sat Jun 27 12:58:03 2015 UTC,I am crying so goddamn much. Absolute tears of joy.
motogp,3b9f6r,oh84s,26,Sat Jun 27 12:58:37 2015 UTC,"What an idiotic move by Marquez, he nearly took them both out at the last corner.  I'm not sure if Rossi will get something for cutting that chicane though. hopefully not."
motogp,3b9f6r,mavam,29,Sat Jun 27 12:43:34 2015 UTC,No way. That was a racing incident. VR had nowhere to go.
motogp,3b9f6r,damnhippie2011,2,Sat Jun 27 12:48:32 2015 UTC,Though MM stated that he think he should be the winner because of Rossi taking a shortcut. This is ridiculous
motogp,3b9f6r,Fatt_Rascal,16,Sat Jun 27 14:20:45 2015 UTC,I think its a pretty solid argument that he was pushed off from contact.
motogp,3b9f6r,ciube,12,Sat Jun 27 12:47:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's definitely objective that marquez pushed rossi out, also the honda team director admitted that now in Italian tv"
motogp,3b9f6r,mavam,24,Sat Jun 27 12:50:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah and Marc just complained about it in Parc Ferme, ""Rossi made the touch"" and ""Rossi cut the corner"" --right Marquez, because Vale really WANTED to take the line that forces you and the 200mph death machine through rocks."
motogp,3b9f6r,iVarun,22,Sat Jun 27 12:57:50 2015 UTC,"Seriously. I used to love their interactions and like others I speculated how it would be if Rossi was winning and Marquez wasn't. Seems pretty clear Marc isn't as good natured (still smiles, feels fake). When I heard him say to Dylan ""well I got the position, so he cut the corner"" I was like REALLY?! You ran into him in a narrow chicane and he flew into the gravel and somehow didn't crash, wasn't as smooth as all that.  edit: http://i.imgur.com/zLRVcUP.jpg  That's clear as day that Rossi was ahead and on the racing line."
motogp,3b9f6r,mavam,5,Sat Jun 27 13:10:17 2015 UTC,"Marc himself went off track for a bit there.  Half a bike length for the insider rider may be the legal requirement however that doesn't hold if the rider is over the edge himself.   Had Marc gone through the chicane without himself going off track I think only then would have his supposed complaint been relevant, even then it would have been debatable.   Currently though its not even an argument in support of Marc's supposed position."
motogp,3b9f6r,dustyshelves,2,Sat Jun 27 13:24:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at the same time I get it. That was an intense race for both of them. Marc is a kid and he's having a hard time not being on top 100% of the time but for the most part has done a good job of keeping his cool. That chicane can be a real sorting hat as we've seen in the past and it was a rough moment for both. Should be a fun press conference!"
motogp,3b9f6r,Myrelin,6,Sat Jun 27 13:24:57 2015 UTC,As a MM fan I feel like he kind of came off whiny during that interview. Maybe it was the adrenaline? I know everyone is complaining about his agressiveness / recklessness (which we aalllllll see coming) but I'm just glad he finally finishes a race and looks competitive again.
motogp,3b9f6r,Some__Bloke,3,Sat Jun 27 13:17:29 2015 UTC,"I think he genuinely thinks that he was in the right. In which case it's not whiny. I'm more worried about how stubbornly he sticks to the scenario that he was right - and I think the comment about how he ""won"" (since Rossi cut the corner after being punted off the track) was unnecessary.   But, he's a young kid, after a race-long battle on a bike that's still not 100%, and he was up against Rossi. So some heated comments aren't a big deal, I don't think. Rossi seems to just laugh them off (which is probably much better than engaging and starting to disagree with Marc at that point)"
motogp,3b9f6r,watuphomi,11,Sat Jun 27 14:50:34 2015 UTC,100% racing incident. Marquez tried to fit in the smallest of gaps and Rossi closed it. Great racing from both!

motogp,3b9f6r,MouldyTeeth,15,Sat Jun 27 12:45:32 2015 UTC,Dirty riding from Marquez...He almost took Rossi out yet again.
motogp,3b9f6r,mavam,7,Sat Jun 27 12:45:33 2015 UTC,Well Marc is back!
motogp,3b9f6r,MarchingHome,6,Sat Jun 27 12:18:25 2015 UTC,Holy shit what a pass from Vale. That was smooth and fast. First on the inside and then holding it tight around the outside. Brilliant riding.  Sucking him one way! Blowing him the other!
motogp,3b9f6r,baconrocket,4,Sat Jun 27 12:38:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was a beautiful moment in the race."
motogp,3b9f6r,MouldyTeeth,3,Sat Jun 27 12:55:09 2015 UTC,"I'm shaking. That was incredible, and incredibly stupid. Will race direction dock Rossi for that?  Edit: upon replay, it looks more like Marquez pushed him out than Rossi being too aggressive  in defending the lead. Race direction won't look at that.   but holy shit. Like the corkscrew at Laguna."

motogp,3b9f6r,Ken808,24,Sat Jun 27 12:43:26 2015 UTC,His presence of mind is second to none. He lifted his front wheel so he hit the gravel with his rear tire first avoiding the possibility of digging in and losing the front.
motogp,3b9f6r,TheEndlessObsession,2,Sat Jun 27 13:11:27 2015 UTC,"Such a great little detail.  Rossi is a great rider, he saw that move coming."
motogp,3b9f6r,baconrocket,21,Sat Jun 27 21:35:28 2015 UTC,Most exciting battle for the lead I've ever seen where there were only 2 changes of position at the front. The balls from Rossi to just go through the gravel with the throttle wide open too. Damn.
motogp,3b9f6r,Karl_Vos,4,Sat Jun 27 12:47:54 2015 UTC,If you watch the slo-mo when he gets out of the gravel and on to the tarmac he really opens the throttle up and he lays down a black line of rubber almost to the finish line. Just fantastic.
motogp,3b9f6r,MotoGPCurve,4,Sat Jun 27 13:59:16 2015 UTC,Yeah the throttle wasn't wide open when he was going through the gravel.... Colin Edwards tried that years ago while battling Hayden and it he crashed...

motogp,3b9f6r,sembello,13,Sat Jun 27 12:43:17 2015 UTC,Is Marquez going to see public opinion turn and be the next villain created by Rossi?  It's like Rossi writes the script for this stuff.
motogp,3b9f6r,Ehralur,9,Sat Jun 27 15:33:45 2015 UTC,I loved Marquez right up until that BT sports interview. I know tempers flare and such but he was such a sneaky crap about it.

motogp,3b9f6r,plzdontcallmeginger,11,Sat Jun 27 15:53:11 2015 UTC,Marquez had been a villain to me ever since the kind of bullshit he pulled in Moto2
motogp,3b9f6r,af7er_dark,2,Sat Jun 27 16:24:27 2015 UTC,Admitted MM93 fan here. You can't tell me that watching a rider you have either a) raised b) grown up with or c) worked with a few years lose the race in the final corner wouldn't make you react emotionally. Was Marc's view of the collision wrong? Yes. Did his team/brother/dad think about that when they saw Rossi scoot off the road to win? Absolutely not.
motogp,3b9f6r,plzdontcallmeginger,2,Sat Jun 27 20:30:19 2015 UTC,"agreed to a point. it just didn't look great to me after hearing Marc in parc ferme sound cocksure that he won, and that VR was in the wrong.  wouldn't irk me quite so much if it wasn't BLATANTLY quarter-assed, and black and white dead wrong.   the shittiest part is....Rossi was/is leading the championship. I don't think that bit was lost on Marc."
motogp,3b9f6r,pendolare,2,Sat Jun 27 23:04:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, I'm not talking at all about Marc's attitude. He's a competitor through and through, and probably too proud to admit he was wrong the first time he called Vale out. I'm talking about how people keep pointing to that .gif of his garage as evidence that he's some kind of super villain. Just seems like the wrong thing to target to me."

Also, Moto GP commentator guy ... dude, the fact that Valentino is 36 is pretty interesting the first time you say it, less so the second, kind of annoying the third time, getting pretty tired by the fourth, a bit stupid by the fifth, straying into the realm of conversations with an Alzheimer's patient by the sixth, sounding like a piss rip by the seventh and time to turn the sound off on my laptop by the eighth.   Maybe, I dunno, spend a bit of time learning about the different riders, what's going on in the championship and in this race in particular and use that info to change it up a bit."

motogp,3b9f6r,OnTheTerlet,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:09:23 2015 UTC,My opinion the more competitive factories the better the racing.
motogp,3b9f6r,Some__Bloke,2,Sat Jun 27 07:45:23 2015 UTC,Exactly! It'd be so awesome to see the Big 4 take on the Italians. There's talent out there on satellite bikes that would be awesome to see on a factory ride but won't be able to get there for the time being. Another factory in there would put up 2 more seats for deserving riders.

motogp,3b97fg,tallyrand,1 point,Sat Jun 27 06:14:22 2015 UTC,"It's ridiculous. They have tiered licenses for cars, and then motorcycles by engine sizes, in 5 tiers:  Up to 50cc (no license), up to 150cc, up to 350cc, up to 550cc, and >550cc. That's not the problem, the problem is the corruption (specifically in my district), and the reason why I don't bother with a license anymore, I just don't stop for the police.   I posted the story of why I don't have a valid license anymore a while back"

Specially considering they have been raided by the police several times already, several employees are in jail, and they are still going at it. They also pull the same shenanigans on car licenses. I know people whose test was just 3 or 4 city blocks of easy driving, and others that were taken on a 30 minute drive around the city, taking some of the worse streets, in rush hour. Of course, the later group didn't pay for lessons, and were frequently refused a license. Some people I know have declared an address in a nearby city just to be able to take the exam at another district where this shit doesn't happen. Personally, I'm happy with my current solution (I don't stop for cops, obscured license plate). They can go eat a bowl of dicks for all I care."

In November I visited Aconcagua (6962m, tallest in America, 2nd tallest behind Everest in terms of prominence, and tallest outside the Himalayas). I plan on making the summit probably in 2017). Last year in April I went to Ushuaia, southernmost tip of the continent, and summited Mount Martial (1100), also did an awesome trek east-west across the glaciar near the summit. Before that I went to Calafate, trekked across the Perito Moreno glacier (that was fantastic).   Eventually, I want to summit an eight thousadender somewhere in the Himalayas. Not interested in the obvious Everest though, it's gotten so commercialized, that it's impossible to find a single second alone, it's just a queue of people to the summit, large parts of the normal route are laddered, not a ""real"" experience if you know what I mean."

motogp,3b7yaf,JohnnieDarko,2,Fri Jun 26 20:05:01 2015 UTC,xbox360 controller might one of the best controllers ever made. Good resolution on both the stick and the triggers

motogp,3b7yaf,iliveonapalebluedot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:05:39 2015 UTC,"Had the same issue when I upgraded/used a very fast bike for the first time in Ride. Using 700cc naked bikes there were no wheelies or stoppies, and I didn't even have to use the brakes for corners.   Just like in real life, you have to be super smooth on the throttle and the brakes. Don't just mash in the trigger button to accelerate, uniformly depress it and the bike will not power wheelie. Same thing for the brakes."
motogp,3b7yaf,gustafh,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:48:31 2015 UTC,"from the gameplay i've seen, a lot needs to be done to get this game up to date on the new consoles.  graphics, sound, and ai all need improvement."
motogp,3b7yaf,grimmey,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:48:43 2015 UTC,"MotoGP 14 player here. To improve at this game, you really have to start on the Moto 3 bikes. They will give you a proper understanding of how the bikes respond to input and how to find the racing line.   As for the racing line overlay, I would turn it off. Maybe they fixed it in the 15 version, but in the 14 version the line was pretty inaccurate. It's far better to just look through turns and have your eyes one step ahead.  When you finally get comfortable on the Moto 3 bikes, hopping on to a MotoGP bike makes you realize what insane machines these things really are."

motogp,3b6go8,YeOldBacon,20,Fri Jun 26 14:27:08 2015 UTC,"If it ain't broke don't fix it, Dorna seem to be managing the sport well in my opinion."
motogp,3b6go8,Karl_Vos,2,Fri Jun 26 13:04:52 2015 UTC,"Really? Two manufacturers have won races in the last 5 years, a satellite bike hasn't won a race since 2006 and the last time a different manufacturer except Honda or Yamaha have won a championship is 2007."
motogp,3b6go8,Puppysmasher,19,Fri Jun 26 14:20:18 2015 UTC,"The grid is more full with competitive bikes than ever. Take off your rose tinted glasses. There has never been a full grid of machinery capable of winning. The only improvement could be satellites capable of winning again but with 6 future manufacturers its always going to be a factory team dominated sport.  Take a look at the times this year, the spread is ridiculous for the top 10. The sport has gotten way more competitive in both man and machine. You need to be a alien on factory kit to win, and as we see with Marc, when the stars don't align that can still not be enough for a x4 World Champion.  EDIT: Just look at who you have to potentially beat just to land in the top 5 much less podium:    Just the GOAT in the sport (no biggy LOL) Just youngest winner in MotoGP and x4 World Champion (x2 in GP with the title in his rookie year). Just the most winning non-premier class title holder with a 60%+ podium record in GP and still a x3 World Champion Just a x4 World Champion (x2 in GP) best Spanish 250 rider of all time, winner his rookie year and 4th in the championship. O and he got 4th in a race in his rookie year with two busted ankles.   Look further down at the top ten and the list gets ridiculous lol"
motogp,3b6go8,YeOldBacon,3,Fri Jun 26 16:14:51 2015 UTC,"That is true, but you have to remember the crop of factory riders in recent years has been excellent, the 'Aliens' so to speak. Therefore for a satellite bike to win would be very difficult. Moreover in regards to a lack of manufacture victories there have only really been 3 manufacturers in recent years and Ducati are widely seen as having suffered due to their own mistakes.   In recent years they've been given a push by Dorna in terms of rules and are now competitive. While it can be argued this should of been done earlier, people have already criticized these concessions, e.g soft tires. My comment was more aimed towards the current set of rules and the racing it has created as well as the manufacturers it has attracted. I acknowledge previously their were failings but I wouldn't solely put Dorna responsible for them."
motogp,3b6go8,nightscout1,-2,Fri Jun 26 14:49:01 2015 UTC,"Yep. Look what DMG did to AMA, killed the sport. MotoAmerica has like 6 riders and 5 races for the whole year.....I used to LOVE AMA events."
motogp,3b6go8,W50,8,Fri Jun 26 13:19:18 2015 UTC,"I love the direction the sport has taken in recent years. A few years ago when the CRT class was introduced, the racing was quality at the top of the field but we barely had enough bikes to fill the points and it always seemed like below 8th place was irrelevant. Now, the overall quality of grid is at an all time high with highly competitive teams/manufacturers and riders, I think we are in a special mini era of MotoGP."
motogp,3b6go8,hairymanchild,7,Fri Jun 26 14:13:47 2015 UTC,Possible 20-round season. Best update patch ever.

motogp,3b6go8,S3baman,3,Fri Jun 26 22:58:16 2015 UTC,Very good rules in my opinion. With 6 manufacturers we should have plenty of variety on the grid. A shame that they're limiting the field to 24 riders but if all bikes are competitive than it'll be happy
motogp,3b6go8,KingLuis,3,Fri Jun 26 13:26:53 2015 UTC,i love how dorna works with the teams to keep things running and stable.  unlike the fia and formula 1.

I feel like these items are going to be talking points for a few years and it would make a great short FAQ for people wanting to know what is going on as the sport prepares for big changes.   Here is the article from April that gives further details on the 30% subsidy increase. LINK   What about support for satellite teams, how are you going to increase your support for non-factory teams?  A lot, a lot - the cost we agreed that the manufacturers will charge to lease them bikes, including everything except crashes, will be practically covered by the money we pay to them..   ""Free"" bikes for everyone!  I am so glad MotoGP is looking healthier than every. Carmelo and DORNA have done a fantastic job since implementing CRTs and saving the sport. With Thailand getting ready to host future races and the Southeast Asia market booming in popularity, the next few years are going to be exciting for MotoGP. Kawasaki really need to get into the paddock in some shape or form, WSBK's future still looks shaky and the brand lockout is coming fast."
motogp,3b6go8,pondiki,2,Fri Jun 26 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"The problem with stickying the post now (or for any length of time other than the summer break / off season) is the race weekend gets three sticky posts: FP1/2, FP3/4 Q1/2, Race. So tomorrow will be the race thread and then in two weeks we go through the process again with Sachsenring.  I updated the sidebar with a link to this post."
motogp,3b6go8,ross_rossifumi,3,Fri Jun 26 16:30:43 2015 UTC,"No more (technical) rule changes for the next couple of years. Changes only if they are necessary for safety reasons.   Sounds good, but the changes from 990cc down to 800 then back up again were done for safety reasons, so the biggest rule changes aren't ruled out!  Not that I think that will happen, but it is possible!"
motogp,3b6go8,Big_douche,6,Fri Jun 26 12:26:22 2015 UTC,turned out to be a moot point though because the 800's ended up being just as fast.
motogp,3b6go8,ross_rossifumi,3,Fri Jun 26 13:38:09 2015 UTC,"Faster even - higher corner speed resulted in higher speeds on the straights.  That's why they increased the capacity again, and consequently pissed off any smaller factories with the instability in ruls requiring regular complete redesigns. Which is why the new set-term rules are a good thing - I was beimg a little facetious."

Its the same reason why new teams do not get subsidies and why grid slots are limited. Dorna rightfully wants to reward teams and factories that have stuck with the sport, not bandwagoners only there when times are good."

motogp,3b6go8,pujarakishan,15,Fri Jun 26 12:30:01 2015 UTC,"Not referring to the above poster but there are many fans out there that refuse to call the track the Red Bull Ring (Red Bull actually own the track) because they feel brand names shouldn't be part of a circuit's name, completely unaware that ""A1"" is a telecom company in Austria that helped fund the circuit's construction and named the track after themselves."
motogp,3b6go8,Dan27,2,Fri Jun 26 13:10:54 2015 UTC,So those people should call the circuit Österreichring though the new circuit is different from the old Österreichring .
motogp,3b6go8,pujarakishan,2,Fri Jun 26 13:21:56 2015 UTC,"No one should call that place the Österreichring ;) its an insult to that once great circuit :)  A1 Ring, Red Bull Ring, either way.

They did the S1krr and WSBK as an R&D project and learned what they wanted to and are done with it. The investment required to get from WSBK to GP is not insignificant, just look at Aprilia, who stomped WSBK while barely hanging on in GP.

motogp,3b5r8n,bazacko,17,Fri Jun 26 05:40:57 2015 UTC,"Having brake and throttle on at the same times means he can feather from one to the other, speeding up or slowing down through the turn, with less chance of updating the suspension on the bike since there is no point of ""pads making contact"" or ""fuel starting to flow"". Both have already happened.  The amount of brake and throttle likely changes throughout the race, and the thumb can control instantaneously for tire wear, fuel load, changes in temperature, other rider nearby, marbles on the track, etc."
motogp,3b5r8n,SoftwareMaven,2,Fri Jun 26 07:00:44 2015 UTC,this and another thing is weight distribution. dethrottling doesnt shift the center of gravity as quick as decelerating
motogp,3b5r8n,papi_chulo83,13,Fri Jun 26 15:46:49 2015 UTC,The rear brake can be used to alter the angle of the rear swing arm by making it 'squat'. That is you can get the front of the swing arm to be pushed down which in turn can lengthen or shorten the wheel base of the bike (depending on where it is in it's range of movement) or it can be used to keep the bike from lifting the front when under power (front of the bike may change angle but will be planted to the ground rather than lifting off the ground during a wheelie).     I don't think they are allowed electronics hooked up to the rear brake and this can't be done (I'm pretty sure) from the engine as it is literally due to the force being applied by the brakes at that location
motogp,3b5r8n,SellMeSomeSleep,2,Fri Jun 26 08:23:36 2015 UTC,"Ok, that makes sense, but the power of the engine wouldn't overcome the brake and undo the squat?"
motogp,3b5r8n,buhuhilus,3,Fri Jun 26 11:29:30 2015 UTC,It only takes a little bit of brake pressure to put tension on the chain and squat the rear.

motogp,3b5r8n,elephino1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:13:37 2015 UTC,It can help keep the chassis and suspension settled because there's not that millisecond delay between them for the suspension to rebound. It helps keep everything hunkered down.

motogp,3b5r8n,binlagin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:05:47 2015 UTC,Using a foot brake doesn't make sense. You can't use it very well when making heavy right hand corners.  Rear hand brakes will become more and more popular.
motogp,3b5r8n,LordCroak,1 point,Sat Jun 27 09:32:29 2015 UTC,"Probably, with lean angles the way they are now. Will probably be a slow transition though because everyone still learns with a foot brake"

motogp,3b5r8n,binlagin,0,Fri Jun 26 16:49:09 2015 UTC,"He is awesome, but he is the slowest alien."
motogp,3b5r8n,OnTheTerlet,-1,Sat Jun 27 09:33:09 2015 UTC,"So the on screen brake/throttle indicator only shows front brakes? Also, I don't see how being on the throttle and rear brakes at the same time would accomplish anything."
motogp,3b5r8n,kz750,2,Fri Jun 26 10:26:42 2015 UTC,"The rear brake can be used to help ""settle"" the tire even if under throttle, or to change the suspension load. I'm sure he knows what he's doing."
motogp,3b5r8n,OnTheTerlet,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:48:27 2015 UTC,So among other things its a sort of fail safe against the rear tire breaking out on the exit of a turn?
motogp,3b5r8n,Ih8Hondas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:33:15 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. You could still slide while using both. It's more of a way to keep the chassis and suspension settled than anything.

motogp,3b5ryt,YeOldBacon,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:37:09 2015 UTC,He's also light. Maybe that helps him direction the bike in places and ways he couldn't if he was shorter.
motogp,3b5ryt,sktrdie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:03:05 2015 UTC,"I doubt it makes much difference for that. Dani Pedrosa is one of the smallest riders and he can be pretty agile. Rossi's probably only as light as he is maybe partially due to natural physique but probably a lot of conscious decisions about what goes into his body and how often he exercises and specifically what kind exercise he does.   Not that it's the most important thing because rider skill and your bike's tech make all the difference, but I think Marquez probably has one of the best natural physiques for racing motorcycles. Kinda short, but evenly proportioned and seems like he's even got a little more muscle than you see on some of the thinner riders."
motogp,3b5ryt,FattyBear,2,Sat Jun 27 01:00:25 2015 UTC,Suprising that they have almost the same exact line even with EsP leaned over so much more. Would this be from the differences in technology in the bikes?
motogp,3b5ryt,whodidisnipe,3,Fri Jun 26 05:43:47 2015 UTC,"my guess is that the tech isnt that far off, but im betting one is carrying a whole lot more speed than the other, making this comparison kinda skewed"
motogp,3b5ryt,from_dust,6,Fri Jun 26 05:58:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think is a speed issue.

The combined center of gravity (bike and rider) would probably be at the same place for both. That's the whole idea for leaning off, it allows for the same cornering radius while the bike itself is leaned over less and therefore has more effective suspension travel."

motogp,3b5n6v,YamahaRN,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:42:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will crash, but he will fade with the 2015 engine being the way it is with the tires. We could see Rossi v Marquez similar to Stoner v Rossi Laguna Seca. Stoner much like Rossi this weekend was great for most of the practice, had excellent race pace, and qualified pole. Rossi back in 08 much like Marquez knew Stoner could easily get away if he isn't challenged to a duel.   The biggest difference being Rossi being more welcome to a fight than Stoner was. Rossi's cooler head will prevail and will most likely break Marquez the way he broke his rivals in the past: he would hound them for a good number of laps getting them to ride to their limit then finally pass and pull away a huge gap within two laps."

motogp,3b5n6v,Fatt_Rascal,3,Fri Jun 26 04:14:01 2015 UTC,Neither; FP3 times.   I thought it's the best combined practice time (FP1-FP3)? That's also why sometimes when they're worried about rain during FP3 they try to throw in fast laps at the end of FP2.
motogp,3b5n6v,Disgruntled__Goat,3,Fri Jun 26 11:54:31 2015 UTC,"You're right, though I thought /u/Fatt_Rascal was right before I checked:  MotoGP™ Qualifying explained: As in previous years, there will be three 45-minute Free Practice sessions, which on a regular race weekend will be held Friday morning and afternoon, as well as Saturday morning. The times set in those sessions will count towards Qualifying, with the combined results determining whether a rider will participate in Q1 or Q2.  Q1 will consist of the riders whose times are 11th place and below, and will be a 15-minute session. During this time riders will have the incentive to qualify for Q2, which the two fastest of the session will be able to contest. This will result in 12 riders contesting the final 15-minute Q2 session, to determine the starting order at the front. The riders not in the fastest two places in QP1 will take grid positions 13 and above according to their placement in QP1.  To accommodate for any unforeseen changes or necessary adjustments, there will be a 30 minute Free Practice 4, which will be held before the two Qualifying sessions. This will not be timed, nor count towards which Qualifying a rider will take part in.   The three existing sessions of free practice will be unchanged, however, the combined times from those sessions will determine participation in the final qualifying practice. The ten fastest riders will be seeded through to Qualifying Practice 2 (QP2). All other riders will take part in Qualifying Practice 1 (QP1). The fastest two riders in QP1 will progress to QP2, making a total of 12 riders competing for the first 12 grid positions. The riders not in the fastest two places in QP1 will take grid positions 13 and above according to their times in QP1.   After warm-up sessions for each category on race-day, traditionally the smallest category, in this case Moto3™, takes to the track first, with the Moto2™ class following and then finally the MotoGP™ event. This can be subject to change however. Races vary in length between 95-130km and normally last between 40-45 minutes, conforming to a set number of laps, which differs at each track. Pit-stops are rare but permitted, and are especially applicable in changeable weather conditions when riders can enter the pit-lane and switch machines to one fitted with different spec tyres (only MotoGP™)."
motogp,3b5n6v,cantpee,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:12:05 2015 UTC,"My biggest hint was the frantic FP2 laps they've put in in the past, whenever they were unsure about the weather.  + At the start of FP3 they always show the combined FP times up to that point - that'd be useless if they didn't count into qualifying rankings."
motogp,3b5n6v,SpontaneousDisorder,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:17:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I imagine it's stressful to manage all that needs to be managed in the practice sessions.

motogp,3b5sw6,sloCycle,14,Fri Jun 26 05:10:16 2015 UTC,"I think it's a tiny bit unfair to criticise Marquez too much for this sort of thing; both him and Pedrosa (and Cal) have said that the Honda is very unpredictable on the brakes, and often what works as a brake marker on previous laps is too late on others.   Marquez always seemed to be able to understand the issues and ride around them, but this year that doesn't seem to be working. Perhaps we'll see him start to develop a riding style closer to Pedrosa's to try and be smoother?"
motogp,3b5sw6,ross_rossifumi,5,Fri Jun 26 05:22:44 2015 UTC,"I remember him saying in Mugello that he was trying to ride smoother but it took so much focus and one mistake = crash (which was why he crashed).

motogp,3b5sw6,Ehralur,2,Fri Jun 26 08:58:42 2015 UTC,"Seems people are pretty polarized on this but I can see a little bit of both sides. On the one hand Marc does ride a very loose style and we've all seen him get the bike out of shape and it not seem to phase him. On the other, this year it does seem to be phasing him a bit more and he does seem to be less in control and pushing harder. The only really point I'd like to make is that he seemed to have more close calls than others in these practice sessions. I didn't see Rossi, Lorenzo, Pedrosa, The Ducati's or even Cal Crashlow have as many close calls. It does highlight that things aren't going great for him and that he is riding closer to the ""danger zone"".  Aggressive? Definitely. Reckless? Maybe only Marc knows how reckless he's being."
motogp,3b5sw6,ZaphodPrefect,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:33:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure why this is getting downvotes, I am just asking what other people think.  The announcers seems to make a big deal out of ""Whoaaa, Marquez almost took out another rider"" and ""Lorenzo wasn't happy with the way Marquez was riding behind him so let him pass"", I have not seen other riders getting into the same kinds of situations as often as Marquez.  I would probably just say he is the most aggressive rider out there willing to ride closer to and over the limit more often than anyone else.  In the past this was maybe the fastest way around the track, but with the advances by other teams, and changes to his bike, it's not a style that is working out well this year."
motogp,3b5sw6,OnTheTerlet,2,Fri Jun 26 20:04:45 2015 UTC,So kind of like how you could only call it reckless if he had taken out the rider ahead of him?

motogp,3b2upf,Myrelin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:12:00 2015 UTC,You'd think this GP would have to stay due to its location and popularity.  I once read it is one of the more highly attended GPs and is it the furthest east in Europe?  Eastern Europe is less represented in MotoGP and the Brno round helps cover that.  It would be a shame to lose it.

motogp,3b3mia,YamahaRN,3,Fri Jun 26 04:58:05 2015 UTC,Fun fact: The Assen TT is the only race that was held every year since the start of the 500cc championship in 1949. The race has always been held on Saturday because the original event in 1928 let drivers race past a church. Obviously the organisation didn't want to upset everyone going to church on Sunday.
motogp,3b3mia,Ehralur,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:28:19 2015 UTC,On paper it makes complete sense to move it to Sunday. I'm curious if attendance will noticeably increase though.
motogp,3b3mia,dingus420,5,Thu Jun 25 19:53:53 2015 UTC,"I liked the Saturday, because you could go home without stress and the need to be ready for work on the next day."
motogp,3b3mia,servenToGo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:16:30 2015 UTC,Sounds pretty logical from an economic standpoint. The only thing that bugs me about it is that it's the only European round that I don't have to stay up until 1am on Monday morning to watch. Now that's gone. Oh well.

motogp,3b251j,MouldyTeeth,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:48:25 2015 UTC,Very true.  I would be interested to see a plot of corner speeds between all the bikes- I'm guessing the Suzukis have a couple kph on the rest of the field in every corner when the boys are on point.

motogp,3aymvv,jpoma,42,Wed Jun 24 15:36:19 2015 UTC,My hope is that a faster Marquez will slow down Lorenzo so that Rossi can pass them both. I can dream.
motogp,3aymvv,scrotch,15,Wed Jun 24 21:23:21 2015 UTC,"Don't stop there!   A faster Marquez gets in Lorenzo's head so he drops to 10th and eventually back to the pits due to another ""helmet issue"". Rossi gets lost in the fray and over-aggressive AEspagaro takes him out along with Pedrosa and the Factory Duc's at the first corner after the start. Crutchlow looks to be 2nd but the bucking Honda gets the better of him and he crashes out, along with Miller and Redding. Smith looks great until an unforced error near the end of the race. Vinales and P Espagaro are locked in a tight battle until Vinales gets too close in a corner and takes them both out. Hernandez's bike bursts into flames around the same time. Marquez finishes 1st, then 3 minutes later Petrucci sails through, and another 10 minutes later Loris Baz takes his first podium of the year."

motogp,3aymvv,af7er_dark,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:29:02 2015 UTC,"Hmmm I don't currently have any up-to-date photos but it's a NSR250 MC21 with the Tyga Performance tail and GP250 front cowl. It's originally an MC 21 R model, but the plan is to make it a MC28 SP model (single side swing-arm, dry clutch motor, adjustable shock and forks). Only thing left is to get an Ohlins shock (my forks have Ohlins internals in them) and source a wheel and stuff for the single side swingarm, although the original gull arm works just fine. I'll also get a Brembo caliper for the rear so I can have it underslung. I have to redo the wiring harness because I want all the electronics up in the front cowl with a lithium battery (so all up, the total weight up front should be a much as the original cluster). I'll also use a trail tech speedo/RPM gauge cluster because the old school one is bulky. And other than modding my MC18 Tyga chambers to fit my MC21 frame (probably via adapter plates) I am more or less done for now. Someone offered to paint it for free as well so I'll probably just do a Movistar blue (Pedrosa 250GP era) without graphics just yet. I've been pretty lucky because I've got some good deals on NSR parts. So if all goes to plan, once I sell off the spares I don't need, it should have cost me nothing. I'll post up pictures once it's done, probably on /r/motorcycles. Unfortunately HRC parts are extremely hard to come by so weight reduction is pretty tricky. But the goal is 65HP and as close to 100kg as I can get."

motogp,3aymvv,vin97,6,Wed Jun 24 22:22:36 2015 UTC,I wonder how much of this is to restore Marquez's confidence in the bike as opposed to a concession that the new chassis just didn't perform.
motogp,3aymvv,YellowG1,3,Wed Jun 24 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"A lot, I think. I feel like a lot of it is psychological. It doesn't really matter if the bike is actually better (as long as the difference is relatively minute, ofc). What matters is which bike he feels more comfortable on. He is definitely happier with last year's bike, so hopefully that's enough to boost his mentality and THAT is enough to get him that win. Honda definitely has nothing to lose by letting him try this now that Dani is back."

Racing is racing for me, I’m not watching to pass judgment on peoples personalities. He is paid to win and he is doing that but people need something to nitpick so if it makes them feel better then so be it. Feel free to down vote me all you like.

It's not so bad as far as complaints / problems go lol. Like you said, what should he do? Mess up on purpose?  At least in motoGP it's not so bad. There is still a lot of respect. I notice a lot of JL's haters always point out and admit at some point in their arguments / posts / complaints that he is undeniably talented and that they respect his skills. In football it's just blind hate and name calling. Sigh.

motogp,3au2iv,jpoma,5,Tue Jun 23 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"For the last couple of years there has been a disagreement between the owner of the circuit Karel Abraham Sr (yeah that guy) and the local Mayor over who should fund the race. Abraham said he can't fund it alone and asked for help from the government and although it was promised, never arrived. I don't understand why Abraham can't organise the event, Brno has to be one if the most profitable races of the year. Perhaps he  could stop leasing Hondas every year for his son?"
motogp,3au2iv,W50,-2,Tue Jun 23 18:54:24 2015 UTC,"Seems to me Abraham Sr. was already willing to commit big finances to put on the GP, probably more than he spends on the race team.

I found the best spot was down at the end of the back straight - standing trackside there lets you watch them come over the waterfall, then the last two corners - where most of the overtaking happens. Was easy to get a spot there, so I could walk around and get as many beers/bratwursts as I liked without the stress of losing my spot (I was on my own)."

motogp,3aqp77,Puppysmasher,3,Mon Jun 22 21:41:35 2015 UTC,If AB fold I reckon the VDS team will take their spot. They've got the money and given the talent they run in Moto2 it would make sense for them to have a second bike even if it isn't the full works Honda like they are already running. With an extra seat in theory VDS could become a serious satellite team very quickly.

motogp,3ap8lq,Ged_UK,7,Tue Jun 23 04:04:15 2015 UTC,About 10 years ago I pretty much despised him more than any other rider. He was this young and pampered Spanish hot-shot who came into the Repsol garage and took all of Honda's attention away from Hayden. Then in Portugul '06 he took Nicky out and almost ruined his title hopes.   More recently I've found myself rooting for him. He's had a big attitude adjustment and he's undeniably talented. It's a real shame he hasn't been able to take a title yet. I think it's pretty commonly discussed but he's one of the best to never win one.
motogp,3ap8lq,dingus420,13,Mon Jun 22 15:52:52 2015 UTC,"You know what's interesting about Pedrosa?  I never got the impression that he was cocky or arrogant, even to this day.  He was just a very quiet, introverted, and very talented rider that was touted with potential multi-world champion success.  A lot of the noise about Pedrosa was external to him:  Repsol obviously favoured Pedrosa over Hayden, since they get another Spanish potential world champion since Creville.  The very abundant Spanish Media also obviously favoured Pedrosa over Hayden, since they get another Spanish potential world champion since Creville.  Pedrosa's manager Alberto Puig was always making controversial comments, and in my opinion, was not doing any favours for Pedrosa.  Hayden, was clearly not embraced by any of those.  It also looked like Honda was not doing enough to prevent the toxicity in that year (2006).  You can obviously tell in 2007 Honda began to favour Pedrosa much more, though, you could argue the rule changes to 800cc and consequently smaller framed bikes had a lot to do with that.  But...despite all that Hayden is still the 2006 world champion."

Sadly Nicky got caught out in the cold and we'll never know what could've been."

That is the reason the race was staged on the Saturday. That proved a success, so we continued to do it on the Saturday.

motogp,3agvnh,bluenoser4ever,5,Sat Jun 20 02:44:40 2015 UTC,The spec sheet lists that it takes 10 seconds to do 400km/h-0km/h.     The deceleration figures I can find for MotoGP in a quick search are 1.1-1.6G = -38.5km/h to 56km/h speed reduction per second  (would be a function of bike speed [ie air drag] and rider weight). Plus a listed 100-0mph = 4 seconds for the 2012 RC212V.    Sources: http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/motogp/17486184 http://motodna.net/trail-braking/

motogp,3agvnh,kobullso,9,Sat Jun 20 03:08:03 2015 UTC,At that level it is all about performance and it is my understanding that it is faster to have an automatic. Less fun maybe but maybe faster.
motogp,3agvnh,Kilfeed_Me,9,Sat Jun 20 03:48:25 2015 UTC,Modern automatic gearboxes that cost 20k and require service monthly are a lot faster than manuals.
motogp,3agvnh,chasingchicks,-8,Sat Jun 20 03:51:46 2015 UTC,"If you are really really good at shifting with a manual gear box, it takes you about 0,1 seconds to change a gear. Modern dual clutch gear boxes are at 0,02 to 0,015 seconds for the same process"
motogp,3agvnh,Antares_,8,Sat Jun 20 12:27:17 2015 UTC,"0,1 second? Cut your bullshit. If you shortshift vertically, you can get down to low .3, but that would be without fully engaging the clutch and you'd destroy it after ~500 shifts. Professional GT racing drivers take around .4-.5 seconds to shift vertically and .8-1 seconds to shift horizontally."
motogp,3agvnh,chasingchicks,-4,Sat Jun 20 13:33:20 2015 UTC,"You can actually just slam the next gear in without using the clutch at all, requires to adjust the rpm to the perfect point. I am too scared to try this with my car but I do it a lot on my bike. Check this video if you've never seen it"
motogp,3agvnh,Antares_,3,Sat Jun 20 13:57:44 2015 UTC,"Sure you can, but:   You never get below .3 of a second as you need to wait for the revs to go down a bit If you don't do it perfectly every time you will destroy your gearbox in no time Even if you do it perfectly every time, the lifetime of clutch and gearbox goes down by a lot"

motogp,3agvnh,gnualmafuerte,4,Sat Jun 20 19:19:49 2015 UTC,It's running a dual clutch gearbox which (IIRC) allows for the next gear to be fully engaged with the clutch read to grab while the current gear is engaged and driving which gives you super fast gear changes and is becoming a standard bit of kit in luxury cars.    http://koenigsegg.com/one1/
motogp,3agvnh,kobullso,-4,Sat Jun 20 04:01:55 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not so sure about that. I've never driven anything with an automatic gearbox, so I might be talking out of my ass ... but after I've got to known a car or motorcycle for a bit, I can shift without clutching with fairly good precision, which is way faster than using the clutch. I can slip the clutch a bit if the tarmac is iced, snowed, wet or otherwise slippery. Also, how the hell do you control engine braking if you don't have a clutch pedal? Also, the car doesn't know what I'm going to do. How do you DAGAD with an automatic gearbox?  Also, I think it would be terrifying to just have the car switching gears automatically for you. If I'm in the middle of a turn, an improper shift might make me lose grip. Same if I'm driving in slippery conditions, I might want to control that torque manually. It would be scary as hell to just hear the car shift however it wants.   I just can't imagine anything but a minivan with an automatic gearbox."
motogp,3agvnh,liceisbad,2,Sat Jun 20 04:06:51 2015 UTC,As others have replied. A modern dual clutch automatic is much faster than a manual. As far as the car knowing. I would guess cars like this have accelerometers and sensors on the suspension that all feed into a computer.

Wasn't a borrowed bike, he is the test rider, must have put more miles on that actual bike around that track than any of the other riders out there.   He can do what he wants with the engines, they haven't got to last and he can have different gearbox internals than the other guys so he can run a lot more power in practice seasons.

motogp,3aeunq,Fatty_Tuna,4,Fri Jun 19 23:06:35 2015 UTC,I think Lorenzo and Pedrosa will always be held higher to most people than biaggi. Biaggi opposed Rossi to the very end which made many dislike him and see him as a worse rider. Lorenzo no longer openly and directly fuses with Rossi and Pedrosa has never been a really threat to Rossi's crown.

I remember there was a mini-drama a while ago involving Alberto Puig and Kevin Schwantz regarding Dani's success where it was pointed out that Pedrosa has three junior class WCs and Schwantz has the one 500 WC. When people look back though they're always going to remember Schwantz as mega-fast because he was a fan favourite. I don't know if the same will happen for Pedrosa (unfortunately)."

motogp,3aeunq,pompey606,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:24:29 2015 UTC,"No one is saying that he's not fast, because he definitely is, it's his ego that will forever have him remembered poorly in the annals of MotoGP history. No one likes to lose, especially professional racers, but when any of the top names lose, they are for the most part graceful losers, admitting that they were not the fastest and they were beat fair and square. Biaggi did none of that, he couldn't believe a young upstart like Rossi could be faster than him, so he kept making excuses. Rossi completely buried him after he made the switch to Yamaha which Biaggi put all of the blame on for not being able to beat Rossi before, and Rossi completely dominated him yet again. Also the bit of dirty pool in Suzuka 2001 did him no favors either."

We went in the right side and all crammed in and had some pretty amazing food to be fair. It was just surreal the way he was completely alone in the giant gazebo. I am pretty sure he won both races.

I thought it did an excellent job of illustrating that feeling"
motogp,3adate,MC_Dickie,3,Fri Jun 19 09:08:10 2015 UTC,"Whilst the movie is pretty good, you aren't preparing for anything nevermind a corner when you are 'in the zone', you're just there, semi-conscious as Senna once described looking down on his own car driving the Monaco lap, your mind can be thinking about anything else whilst you're turning laps, what you had for dinner, how xyz pissed you off or interpreting something that someone said.   The fact is your so concentrated it just becomes subconscious and you actually have the brain capacity to think about other shit whilst you are turning amazingly fast laps consistently.  Being IN THE ZONE just means you're basically not fully aware of what you're doing , it's almost not fully intentional, it's like rhythm if you bang on a drum with a particular pattern, and you really enjoy doing it, and you keep doing it, eventually your mind will wander away but you'll still be banging this same drum pattern over and over again. It's exactly the same as racing.  The misconception is that being in the zone means you are hyper-concentrated but consciously speaking it's the opposite, you aren't having to intentionally concentrate at all. This is what 'in the zone' is , it's called flow state). Here is a good description of it in the beginning 1 minute or so in this Documentary ."

I had practiced the song so much that my fingers just took over while I watched. It was actually pretty scary because I felt that my hands were just doing their own thing and I wasn't in control, so if I made a mistake there was no hope that I could recover. But I listened and everything sounded fine so I just went along and nailed it.  That, or I completely bombed it without knowing and got an applause out of sympathy..."

motogp,3a9c8d,gustafh,2,Thu Jun 18 06:53:06 2015 UTC,"So much has changed regarding safety since Doohan's time. Just look back ten years and both riders and teams have put much more pressure on the organisers to improve safety. Probably some monetary aspects as well; the four strokes are much more expensive to crash than the two strokes were, especially with the fixed amount of engines.  That's why we don't see these conditions any more, together with better drainage of course. Races are (or should be) stopped long before we reach this level nowadays. Not always though, just look at the WSBK races at Nürburgring in 2011, that was close to these conditions."

Tbh, any photo of Doohan from '99 just reminds me of that crash and how it fundamentally changed GPs - imagine if Rossi had enterred the 500 class without Burgess, maybe without full HRC support, battling Doohan? Would he have become the dominant force he was?  Without meaning to disrespect his rivals, Doohan was in another class to them. To me it is such a great shame that Rossi never got the chance to race him. Could have led to comparisons to all the greats Doohan raced too."

motogp,3aa7kg,cantpee,2,Thu Jun 18 23:32:29 2015 UTC,"I believe that Rossi is the GoAT and I don't believe that anyone in the MotoGP paddock today is going to approach his success. MM maybe, but that kid needs to calm the fuck down in order to get there. I don't think anyone would deny that MM has tons of 'natural talent'. Hell, he practically reinvented GP-class riding overnight, and I think Stoner was the same way."
motogp,3aa7kg,YamahaRN,5,Thu Jun 18 19:24:52 2015 UTC,"But greatest doesn't necessarily mean most natural talent. Look at Schumacher in F1. Clearly the GOAT. Hakkinen, Raikkonen, hell even Montoya had more natural talent. Schumi had the motivation and work rate to beat them all. This is kind of how I view Rossi. No doubt top 5 talent-wise, but #1 in motivation and dedication to his sport."

I think Stoner dug himself into a hole though because Honda didn't lose by him leaving, and Marc is still quick on the bike (just all the errors he probably should have made over the last 2 years are happening this year). Also, I think Lorenzo is similar to Stoner in regards to personality so no wonder he would like him to return."

But I'd love to see that level of talent right now. I mean Marquez, Jlo, Dovi, Ianonne, Rossi, Pedrosa, Crutchlow, Smith and the others close to the front PLUS Stoner would be a sight to see. That's a serious roster, especially with all the r&d battles going on right now.  Shake it up Stoner. Make it serious!"

motogp,3aa7kg,mirador1987,7,Thu Jun 18 16:21:13 2015 UTC,MotoGP clearly doesn't need Stoner.  I don't know why people can't seem to let go and accept that a) he's gone and so are his golden days and b) motoGP has moved on and no one except die-hard fans have missed him
motogp,3aa7kg,mirador1987,10,Thu Jun 18 18:13:48 2015 UTC,MotoGP doesn't need any rider. Doesn't mean they don't add something to the series. In this case we're talking about a Champion and race winner.   I find it hard to understand which emotion is driving posts like yours sometimes. Not one of the good ones though.
motogp,3aa7kg,mirador1987,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:12:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's any denying that Stoner was a huge talent, you don't get to be world champion without that. But the fact is that the bikes evolve dramatically year on year - I reckon Stoner could hop on a 2010 bike and still win against other people on a 2010 bike, but put him on a 2015 bike and he would be lost. I know he's had his testing days so at least is familiar with the machines, but that's not the same at all.  I think what a lot of non-Stoner fans get annoyed at is the Stoner fans saying 'he is the best there ever was and if he came back he would beat everybody and the sport just isn't the same without him'. Personally I do not believe that any of those things are true. He is one of the best riders of a set era, if he came back he would probably be inside the top 10, I don't think 'the sport' misses a rider who would rather be setting lap times by himself than actually racing and enjoying battles."
motogp,3aa7kg,gco0307,3,Fri Jun 19 08:55:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe he would be lost. I don't know. It would be fun to find out though. Fans like myself would enjoy watching it no matter the result, the haters could finally have their day if he went poorly, and the fanboys could rejoice if he dominated. Personally I find any irrational view annoying. This quote from you is telling on your bias.   I don't think 'the sport' misses a rider who would rather be setting lap times by himself than actually racing and enjoying battles.   It's not 'the sport' I quoted. It's Lorenzo."
motogp,3aa7kg,El_Bard0,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:14:35 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm 100% open with my bias - I hate stoner, I find him whiny and annoying, but that doesn't detract from his phenomenal ability on a motorcycle! Same with Lorenzo, as a person I find him cringeworthy and embarrassing, but he is one of the greatest riders in the world and I have huge respect for both of them.  When I watch a race, I don't want to see Lorenzo (or Stoner) shoot off into the distance in a display of skill and perfection. Yes, it shows that that weekend, they are superior to everyone else, and yes, they deserve to win, but as a spectator, I don't fine that much of a spectacle. I prefer to watch Marc and Iannone trading places 10 times in a lap, or watching Rossi throw a hail-mary attempt under Lorenzo at the last corner (or watching Miller last year getting passed by the whole pack on the straight and then outbrake them and rudely shove inside them on the corner. That's what I find exciting, that's what makes me tune in.  And yes - I am wholly aware that Lorenzo and Stoner are both capable of scrapping like that, but the reason I'm not a fan of them is because they don't enjoy it. When you see Marc or Rossi or the likes after a race with fierce battles, win or lose - they have a huge smile on their faces, they loved that battle, they live and breathe for that battle. Stoner/Lorenzo don't have that passion. Their passion lies in running a perfect lap, hitting every apex, getting every 10th of a second out of a lap, being the fastest and getting away from the pack. And that's fine, there's nothing wrong with that being their passion, but that's not what I like watching, which is why I don't feel 'the sport' has a gaping hole without him.  (And I wasn't referring to your quote, I was referring to the fans who constantly say 'the sport' needs x, y or z)"

motogp,3aa7kg,Deacon46,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:51:39 2015 UTC,"See for me I can enjoy the run away shows or brilliance just as I can a scrap and battle, but I will admit I do kind of like the run aways more as generally it is a show of dominance by one combination on a given day and when you watch it in isolation it is sometimes pure art to watch.  Certainly good battles are fun as well and have the element of 'will he, wont he' type of theatre which will always entertain with the tension of whether it ends with beers or tears at the end.  Each their own in that aspect plus I suspect that it strongly depends on one's own rider preference as well (and I include myself in that, loved watching Miller's dicing battles but also loved Stoner and Doohan's dominance whilst enjoying Rainey's battles)"

If you don't think it would have been great to see stoner, Lorenzo, and Marquez racing against each other for the last 2 years, you are not a fan of the sport.  You think maq would have had that string of victories last year if stoner was racing?  I don't.  There is less talent in motogp without stoner plain and simple and that devalues the sport."

Tiger hasn't retired but he really should and if he did there would be very little impact on the sport. There are plenty of young and talented golfers for people to root for these days. MotoGP would probably be the same. It would certainly be strange not having Rossi there but there is enough talent on the grid to keep everyone engaged in the sport.

I paid for the product, I own the product. A discretely placed logo is reasonable, plastering the product with brands is not. The worst offenders are probably laptops. And they know this, when they advertise the laptop, they show it without calcos, but when it arrives it has at least 3 or 4 sticky, hard to remove pieces of shit all around the touchpad.   I'm fairly sure riders would prefer to put their own design on their bikes, but they instead have brands in there because those sponsors are actually paying for everything. But when people do it ... you own the bike, and you are paying EXTRA to advertise Movistar ... WTF."

It really sucks from my point of view that riders have to have surgery just to be able to compete. It's not just motogp though  I think it's just part of the game. Short of having like mechanical arm supports in suits I don't know how you can reduce the load on the riders arms."
motogp,3a67n9,zudthespud,4,Wed Jun 17 21:25:34 2015 UTC,Next year's Michelins and stock ECUs should drastically reduce the breaking forces. Its going to be an interesting transition.
motogp,3a67n9,SoftwareMaven,2,Thu Jun 18 04:48:19 2015 UTC,Why would ECU's reduce braking forces? I didn't know any control systems were used on the brakes.
motogp,3a67n9,zudthespud,5,Thu Jun 18 16:36:49 2015 UTC,The ECU influences engine braking.
motogp,3a67n9,SoftwareMaven,2,Thu Jun 18 21:12:13 2015 UTC,That only works if the rear tire is on the tarmac.

motogp,3a67n9,kobullso,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:20:43 2015 UTC,"My impression was the 800's would ~top-out on the straights, and the 1000's will continue accelerating all the way through to the next corner."
motogp,3a67n9,cunninghamslaws,4,Thu Jun 18 03:46:04 2015 UTC,But then that only really helps on the longer straights. It wouldn't do much anywhere else. I mean even if they go from 240 to 220 hp that still doesn't solve the breaking force problem. I might help some but I don't think it would be enough.
motogp,3a67n9,kobullso,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:14:57 2015 UTC,It would possibly reduce the the speeds from short corner to corner bursts as well. Less power --> slower speeds.
motogp,3a67n9,cunninghamslaws,3,Thu Jun 18 12:37:39 2015 UTC,"I have just realized, if you think about it the braking force can only ever be the amount that would make the rear tyre lift. It doesn't matter how fast you are going, it's all about the decelleration and the force.  Maybe the answer is mandating a shorter wheelbase so this limit is lower. Interesting problem anyway."
motogp,3a67n9,zudthespud,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:41:43 2015 UTC,Ya but everything I have read pegs the 800s at 220+hp. So your talking maybe 20 hp less and that was 4 years ago. If they switch I don't think it would be long before the hp disparity was closer to 10. I doubt 10 hp would change speeds so much that riders still wouldn't be having the same issues.
motogp,3a67n9,kobullso,5,Thu Jun 18 15:28:02 2015 UTC,"I wonder if they changed the seating position  of the bike, if it would help. Once the bike starts diving, they're quite far over the front. I guess a radically change like that would need very careful planning.  I notice older GP (and even sports bikes) tend to have seating positions where the rider is ""in"" the bike, whereas nowadays the rider sort of sits on top of the bike.   Seriously though, if you've got a sports bike, try and hang a leg off like Rossi does and turn in, it's actually forces a lot of weight on your lower arms."
motogp,3a67n9,KICKERMAN360,2,Wed Jun 17 20:55:16 2015 UTC,It'd be interesting to have pressure sensors on the grips to see how tightly each rider holds them.  Also how many lbs of pull the brake and clutch levers require.  Maybe they'd be able to determine that X rider has issues and Y rider doesn't because Y rider has softer brake/clutch and doesn't hold the grips as tight as rider X.
motogp,3a67n9,MT1982,3,Wed Jun 17 23:05:07 2015 UTC,The bikes already have pressure sensors on the brake levers.
motogp,3a67n9,oscarcbr,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:53:48 2015 UTC,I doubt the clutch has much to do with it. They don't use them for up shifts and I wouldn't be surprised if they had auto blippers for downshifts. But even if they didn't for downshifts the amount of force for the clutch is probably not any different than any other bike.
motogp,3a67n9,kobullso,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:36:51 2015 UTC,Honda and Yamaha are seamless for up and downshifts. No clutch lever required. The slipper clutch (and perhaps ECU) deals with matching RPM to wheel speed on downshifts.   I'm not sure what Ducati and Suzuki have got in theirs.
motogp,3a67n9,opticalminefield,2,Fri Jun 19 07:06:46 2015 UTC,I wonder if you could put airbags in for arms of the suit to try and massage the blood out. If the problem is not being about to get blood out I wonder if you could help mechanically force it out.

motogp,3a67n9,Sugomi,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:11:56 2015 UTC,"Only way I can see them conquering this problem is to make the brakes less powerful, maybe ban carbon or something like that.  They need to get the massive forces of holding themselves on the bikes while it brakes like crazy underneath them so that's either drive their nuts into the tank or through their arms and legs.  Maybe something truly crazy like put the foot pegs way more forward so could kind of stand up for braking.  That would be rather a radical change though."
motogp,3a67n9,bluenoser4ever,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"I could almost see having a second set of footpegs far forward for hard braking. At least in theory. In practice, I doubt it would be a good idea to be switching your feet back and forth for a whole race."
motogp,3a67n9,Eblumen,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:31:07 2015 UTC,"Ya, I did a quick google to see if there were any bikes with the pegs really high and couldn't find anything, closest is the crazy video of the guy riding his bike while laying back texting or something in India.  More I thought about it though, the more it'd destroy their cornering since couldn't hang out.    Thought of some kind of weird thing like in seat belts that under braking lock up so it'd hold their butt to the back of the bike then slack out to allow them to lean for corners but that sounds dangerous for accidents!"
motogp,3a67n9,bluenoser4ever,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:19:45 2015 UTC,Moving footpegs forward would move the centre of gravity forwards which is the opposite of what you want under hard braking.
motogp,3a67n9,mirador1987,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:57:14 2015 UTC,Something attached to the seat that goes up there back and then attaches to their shoulders to hold them back up a bit.
motogp,3a67n9,hazybluez,3,Thu Jun 18 08:36:14 2015 UTC,The problem comes when hanging off and crashing. You don't want to be stuck to the bike.

motogp,3a67n9,500GP,0,Fri Jun 19 01:02:31 2015 UTC,"Time to introduce a brake booster on these bikes to help with the braking.   Although I wonder how it will affect the feel and the response of the brakes, especially for trail braking."
motogp,3a67n9,kroatia04,11,Wed Jun 17 17:33:47 2015 UTC,"Grabbing the brake is not the problem.  I believe they are already boosted at any rate.  Rossi is suggesting the force from bracing yourself while slowing down is the culprit.  This has long been suspected, so not sure why this article exists.  I guess the new bikes are bigger and better than ever and thus cause more problems."
motogp,3a67n9,friends_not_food,2,Wed Jun 17 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"The brakes on a MotoGP bike aren't that dissimilar to the brakes on any sport bike. Sure, all of the materials are exotic and engineered to be stronger, to respond more quickly, to be easier to change, and to tolerate more heat, but, in the end, all the force that pushes the pads against the rotors is coming from the rider's hand/foot."
motogp,3a67n9,SoftwareMaven,5,Wed Jun 17 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"I agree on all points except the last, as all systems are hydrolicaly boosted.  not entirely sure what you're hinting at though?  the speeds and repeated abuse of muscles is what causes the arm pump."
motogp,3a67n9,friends_not_food,2,Wed Jun 17 19:26:20 2015 UTC,"I guess the confusion is on the word  ""boosted"". MotoGP brakes are no more boosted than the brakes on my motorcycle. Hydraulic brakes have been the standard for decades, so I don't see a reason to call that out as special. Anti-lock is prohibited, as is any kind of force assist beyond the normal master cylinder hydraulics.  This is not to downplay the amazing stopping power of carbon-carbon brakes coupled with the Bridgestone tires. It's really something amazing to watch."
motogp,3a67n9,SoftwareMaven,-3,Thu Jun 18 04:39:36 2015 UTC,You and exg are correct but what me and (I think)  SoftwareMaven are taking about is the addition of a brake booster to reduce the force applied to the lever/master cylinder.  Same deal with cars.
motogp,3a67n9,kroatia04,4,Wed Jun 17 21:08:41 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with applying the brakes physically. It's the riders weight shifting from on his rear while under acceleration 180 MPH+ getting to 70 MPH in a 100 ft and getting the bike on it's side before your body can even adjust to the gravity pulling you around. This causes your arms to hold most of your weight on the bike.  There is a brief description of it in Faster, or Fastest I cant remember."
motogp,3a67n9,evilchild0323,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:00:02 2015 UTC,The way I understood it is that that's not the only issue but the 10kg of force that they have to apply to the lever to get it to slow.
motogp,3a67n9,kroatia04,2,Thu Jun 18 02:08:59 2015 UTC,The rider's hand and foot plus the hydraulic advantage from the master cylinder.
motogp,3a67n9,exg,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:54:49 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, just like my bike. There are no fancy gizmos increasing the force applied: no computer controlled electric motors or pneumatic actuated pistons or any other force assist. They are just brakes (if $100000 brakes)."
motogp,3a67n9,SoftwareMaven,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:23:41 2015 UTC,"Boost is generally considered an external assist (such as the vacuum boost on pretty much all auto brake systems).    Motorcycle brakes are based on mechanical advantage (levers & dissimilar piston sizes), but aren't boosted.  Boost would only help the right forearm muscles :).  Edit, the above has nothing to do with the subject (arm issues).  I suspect you're correct, the forces on the riders have increased to the point where, under heavy braking, the rider is balancing himself and the bike on the front wheel.  Over and over."
motogp,3a84wo,idrinkcoldcoffee,10,Wed Jun 17 23:49:20 2015 UTC,I kinda like when Valentino waves to me at home :D  Good times
motogp,3a84wo,ragebourne,6,Thu Jun 18 00:57:17 2015 UTC,No I'd argue a bigger problem is the lack of static cameras or cameras close enough to the racetrack to accurately portray speed.
motogp,3a84wo,tekkentool,1 point,Thu Jun 18 12:42:49 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you remember, but a while ago they used to have curb cams. You couldn't see shit because how accurately they portrayed speed.   The reason why there aren't more of those cameras is that they'd be used rarely during the broadcast."
motogp,3a84wo,McNorch,2,Thu Jun 18 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't choose to watch an entire race this way but it does show what each rider is doing and it's unique. If you have Videopass they did this for Lorenzo, Marquez and Aleix, I think, for one lap around Catalunya, so they're recent videos. I enjoyed hearing the different engine sound as well, which is another cool part of using this camera, IMO."
motogp,3a84wo,mavam,2,Thu Jun 18 01:15:57 2015 UTC,The ones that have the gyro cam are pretty rad.
motogp,3a84wo,cantpee,2,Thu Jun 18 19:44:36 2015 UTC,I can't stand the taintcam™.
motogp,3a84wo,KirigakureSaizo,4,Fri Jun 19 03:08:39 2015 UTC,"I'm a fan of the angle. Maybe it's a bit boring in the middle of a straight or whatever but I think it has value in both an immersion sense and that it does produce some cool shots. Like leaving the pit lane thing, there's generally a wider shot and then bam you're on the bike, you can hear the pit limiter, rider's there doing his little stretch ritual, a wave if we're lucky, and then he looks for traffic and winds it on and you get the onboard sound. To me, that's immersive, it adds to the leaving pits vibe/feeling/whatever. They also often use it on corners and stuff which I find really cool, the bit of tail in the foreground with the gyro gives a really good sense of lean angle and you can better see what the riders are doing with their weight etc than with external shots. So yeah I find it an interesting and immersive perspective. I don't understand how it could possibly be distracting, is it just about finding having to see an arse offensive? Everyone's got one."
motogp,3a84wo,JDFor,2,Thu Jun 18 01:32:11 2015 UTC,The wider angle is great as it actually lets you see 'through' the corner  towards where the rider would actually be looking. Plus getting to see what the rider is doing is cool.
motogp,3a84wo,SellMeSomeSleep,4,Thu Jun 18 06:19:49 2015 UTC,~Back in my day we only had a front and a rear camera with no super slo mo cameras and 4:3 aspect ratio on the TV...
motogp,3a84wo,SellMeSomeSleep,2,Thu Jun 18 06:20:54 2015 UTC,"Well there aren't many places to mount the camera behind the rider except down low on the seat. If you want a forward facing angle that includes the rider's body, that's the way it's gonna be. The more camera angles the better though, I say.   also, as a straight lady I can't say I mind the ass shots ;)"

motogp,3a624r,jpoma,9,Wed Jun 17 14:46:17 2015 UTC,"I'd like to voice an opinion I've had for a short while (that I recently learned Rossi shares) and see what you folks think.  As a disclaimer I cheer for Ducati and Suzuki after Yamaha.  I like both their factories and the riders.  But the concessions they are allowed is the cause of Rossi's woes.  They can qualify on super softs and put Rossi four spots back.  He then has to fight his way to the front every single race.  Which he does, only too late at times.  He needs to qualify better, no question.  But it seems like every thing is stacked against him.  Shorter qualifying, inferior machines being allowed in front of him.  Etc."
motogp,3a624r,friends_not_food,2,Wed Jun 17 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"that's a good point.  the concessions do give favour to Ducati and Suzuki for qualifying.  But as you said, he needs to qualify better.  Lorenzo and Marquez face those same issues, so Rossi is not unique.  It also does not explain why Rossi occasionally gets out-qualified by the satellite factory teams."
motogp,3a624r,friends_not_food,3,Wed Jun 17 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"The only explanation is that he's bad at it.  Even during his dominant years he was not much of a Saturday rider (starting to like that term) he's got almost half as few poles as he does wins IIRC.  He is a racer through and through.  Never count him out in a race.  But either he races at 100% or he can't find those extra few percent on Saturday, because his race pace is always pretty close to how he qualifies.  More so than the other riders."
motogp,3a624r,dialmformostyn,2,Wed Jun 17 18:01:04 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered that, but it's a very good point."
motogp,3a624r,brokendown,2,Wed Jun 17 18:02:33 2015 UTC,"But in the same conversation as that he mentions the fact that Lorenzo manages to do it with the exact same equipment as him. So, there must be something he can do."
motogp,3a624r,pondiki,2,Wed Jun 17 21:22:03 2015 UTC,"On Sunday his pace was a mere 0.03 seconds a lap off Lorenzo’s, but even that’s not enough when he’s 1.3 seconds behind after the third lap.   0.03 seconds a lap off Lorenzo is really good, if he can sort out qualifying to where he gets on the second row at a minimum I think he still has a chance this year."
motogp,3a624r,Armonster20,2,Wed Jun 17 18:31:18 2015 UTC,The suspected flywheel weight issue with Marquez is interesting. Was wondering wtf was going on with that bike.

motogp,3a624r,Armonster20,3,Wed Jun 17 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but in general you can just tell he is pushing his bike a lot harder than the other riders are to keep up with them."
motogp,3a624r,friends_not_food,2,Wed Jun 17 18:55:30 2015 UTC,"I've seen him making mistakes.  could because he's at the limit physically, but I leaned more towards questioning his current mental state.  he's rushing into corners and paying the price more often than not."
motogp,3a624r,Armonster20,3,Wed Jun 17 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"You may be right, I have no idea about his mental state. But I do think you can physically see his bike squirming around much more on entry and exit than the other riders. Which makes it seem like he is at 100% where others are at maybe 98%. Also makes for more  mistakes."
motogp,3a624r,friends_not_food,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:08:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, the bike is less stable, but when he rode that last season people thought he was doing it on purpose.  that's his style.  hes the Gary McCoy of the new generation.  that's why I mentioned his mistakes.  most that I've noticed happened on corner entry"
motogp,3a624r,YamahaRN,2,Wed Jun 17 19:24:43 2015 UTC,"Lorenzo wasn't as dominant in Catalunya as he was from Jerez, Le Mans, and Mugello. In the post-race he knew Rossi was constantly behind him at 1.5 and had to push himself (Lorenzo) into make it a comfortable gap at 2.1. Had Lorenzo sat idly at 1.5, Rossi would have reduced it to 0.4 eventually which is a much more worrisome gap. At that hypothetical point Lorenzo would begin to ride more defensively or harder on more worn out tires."

There's an article on the front page of this sub in which Lorenzo praises Stoner as the greatest natural talent on a motorcycle he had seen, this progression of skill and style seems to back that up. I thought that Lorenzo was just being gentlemanly and speaking well of other riders but I think he might be sincere about that."

motogp,3a67hg,tekkentool,9,Thu Jun 18 10:36:37 2015 UTC,"For those that missed it though, the ""demo"" lap of that bike was so boring. He just cruised around, waving to the fans. I expected him to do at least one lap at a speed that would open the taps up on it even a little bit. But nope, probably didn't even get out of 1st gear. Couldn't even hear the bike go past."
motogp,3a67hg,KICKERMAN360,6,Wed Jun 17 16:50:02 2015 UTC,"Seriously... who made that video? The video had Stoner saying ""Wow this bike is so powerful"" and then it just showed him putting around the track waving at fans like it was a victory lap. Then I'm reminded about the power limits that they're putting on the engines. Their marketing team sure has an interesting approach with this bike."
motogp,3a67hg,lotionpotion,3,Thu Jun 18 00:17:03 2015 UTC,all they had to do to sell the thing was get stoner to do one drift on it with a high speed camera pointed at him but they didn't.

motogp,3a67hg,howheels,5,Thu Jun 18 15:11:57 2015 UTC,"i could see this burying Stoner's itch to race.  I love racing endurance. But at that level, it would go way past grueling really fast. If it's formidable for current riders in GP shape..can barely imagine the suffering for a guy like Casey, who's been injured/burned out/fishing for almost three years now.   Honda has won the race every year since the 08 bike came out. No pressure Casey.....   ps, i hope Yamaha wins, despite Pol being on the team. would've liked to see Josh Hayes or Josh Brookes ride."

The R1 loses out on the straights, so who knows how the development is going.   Nice to see love for my favorite track from GP riders.

motogp,3a67d7,gnualmafuerte,2,Wed Jun 17 19:21:41 2015 UTC,"Comparing his response to JLo's, and you can see why Vale is adored. Being introverted and taciturn myself, to the point of being accused of being arrogant because I don't jump into social situations (and I don't even have to overcome a language barrier), I get JLo, but he could really use some PR coaching."
motogp,3a67d7,SoftwareMaven,3,Wed Jun 17 19:28:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think couching would do much, you either have it or you don't. Some people are introverted, others are extroverted, it's who you are and it's hard to change. Being completely extroverted, I've had the opposite problem (talking too much, talking when it would've been better to just shut up, attracting too much attention when you shouldn't, etc.)  Lorenzo's problem is not that he's introverted, it's not accepting who he is. If you are not great at social interaction, and just show up, do your job, and go home, everybody would love him. ""He just shows up, wins, and goes home. He doesn't even bother saying more than a few words to the press, what a guy!"". Instead, he awkwardly jumps off the podium, jumps into lakes, and struggles planting flags on the ground, and makes everybody cringe. If the doctor suddenly tried to fly under the radar, and just be another guy, he would come through as an asshole too. Never try to be something you're not."
motogp,3a67d7,gnualmafuerte,2,Wed Jun 17 23:33:42 2015 UTC,"So realistically, who thinks Marquez still has a reasonable chance?  I'm actually not ready to write him off just yet. If he gets his chassis sorted out (and Monday's post-race test on the 2014 chassis looked promising) then we can't forget that he had what, 10 straight victories last year? Admittedly Jorge & Vale are much better this year, but so are Dovi & Crazy Joe, and maybe soon suzukis, it's not inconceivable for Marc to win 3 or 4 races where Yamaha don't make it onto the podium, and cut that lead right down. I'm not saying it's likely, and I severely doubt it, but I'm not willing to count him out just yet. 2 more bad races, then I will say no chance.

I mean MM tried the 2014 chassis briefly on Monday and it seemed to give him a bit of safety margin that he hasn't got at the moment. He wanted more laps to be sure though. That isn't an ECU thing.     They are way behind this year due to: -Dani has been out for two races dropping them down in manufacturers points. - Cal has been binning it a bit and Redding is way back. That said though, Bautista and Bradl had a bad time last year as well."
motogp,3a92ae,SellMeSomeSleep,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:17:44 2015 UTC,"The main issue with the bike is the flywheel is too light, they have already said this.   The fix for that is the hard bit.   Dani being there or not makes no difference to the constructors points unless he had been able to beat cals 3rd and 4th rather than match it. Only one rider scores for that, whatever Honda it is doesn't matter."

While teams were talent spotting boys while I was growing up, it was almost unheard of girls receiving the same treatment. Males underestimate girls big time and it's such a disservice to our sport.  Like you, I would have loved to see more girls racing while I was growing up and not being shoved into their own category or used as a marketing trick. Maria and Anna are awesome role models. I grew up racing motorcross and some road but I didn't love it. Motocross was my passion and I raced competitively for some years before I hung up my leathers lol. Now I ride on the weekends for fun. I miss it! What about you?"
motogp,3a2gld,backwards01,4,Wed Jun 17 02:52:16 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. Most racers start on the same level. If a girl grinds it out in the lower levels and wins races then she will get sponsorship. Racing is one of the few things where results talk. The more you win the more interest. You think advertisers wouldn't kill to have a woman AND a podium finish for their bikes? C'mon. For every male that makes it to the higher levels there were thousands that didn't, and sadly there just aren't as many girls who grow up racing. So the chance of making it as a person are already so low. PARENTS should encourage their girls to go race. That's all that's needed."
motogp,3a2gld,piratse,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:25:47 2015 UTC,"I was talking about the 90's when I was growing up. Girls were consistently winning around me and nothing. Boys were the only ones companies wanted to talk too.  It's different now. The attitude has changed somewhat. My parents encouraged me to race but that didn't mean at the time everyone else was as jazzed about girls being involved and they made sure we knew it too. As progressive as racing can be, there is still a very sexist attitude to it. Sometimes your parents support it's not enough. That's true for then and now."
motogp,3a2gld,backwards01,3,Wed Jun 17 21:26:43 2015 UTC,"Nothing to celebrate. Unlike other sports where biological differences force segregation of mens/womens leagues, racing is pure skill. If there were more girls like Herrera who had the desire and skill to beat the boys, they would.   Fact is, chicks are much smarter than blokes who put their lives on the line for a bit of fun. Racing motorcycles is the most insane hobby a human being can partake in. It is basically a guaranteed Darwin award.  Racing at the MotoGP level is the equivalent of galdiatorial contests of the past. People who chose to do it of their own free will were absolute nuts. Brave to the point of stupidity, and skilled as demigods, but still nuts.   Hence our level of respect for these gentlemen.   Chicks have their hands held all the way to the top in every other aspect of modern society (female only quotas/affirmative action/etc), but on track, you can't politic and whine your way to the top. It takes pure skill.  So let's not demean Herrera's achievements by saying ""good job, for a girl"". She's showed her skill as a racer, not as a magical vagina bearer who happened to race bikes.   By the way, this is the same reason I always laugh at announcers, journalists and others who write Rossi off for being ""too old"". Like turning 30 suddenly causes you to develop Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, rendering you unable to operate a motorcycle.  Absolute and utter nuttery, all of it. Show up on sunday, and do the business. Nothing else matters."

Sort of shitty analogy but I can go turbo a Honda Civic or buy a exotic that has more HP than a Formula One car, but which one would you rather have?  Its a GP bike for the street, right down to the engine itself. You are paying to own previously unobtanium GP tech and surprise, surprise, GP stuff is expensive."

motogp,3a69lx,Ih8Hondas,-1,Wed Jun 17 22:05:12 2015 UTC,"unlike the desmo which was touted as a gpbike for the road, this bike is actually the real gp engine and frame. crankcases heads frame wheels suspension are literally the same parts they use on the repsol hondas. they had to use a different piston, less aggressive cams & conventional valve springs to even make it remotely streetable. Even with the changes they had to restrict the revvs to pass noise and emissions tests because they literally took a race bike slapped a headlight in the air intake and are selling it to the public. this isnt a replica, its a detuned RC213-V."

No, they didn't. And no, it isn't. It has a totally different transmission in addition to totally different engine internals as you said. In fact, replica may even be giving it too much credit. In other gearhead circles, replica implies an exterior as well as drivetrain identical to the replicated machine, but if you check the VIN, it would not be one for one of those vehicles."

FYI this bike has the RCV1000R MotoGP transmission, also current frame and swing arm. Name me one road going bike with a current GP chassis and parts. O wait, you can't. (And no, the Desmo RR does NOT share parts with the GP bike)   No, they didn't. And no, it isn't. It has a totally different transmission in addition to totally different engine internals as you said.   Addressed above. The fact that they were even able to pass emissions and regs with a RACE ENGINE is amazing.   I also want to add how hilarious it is to even complain about the lack of a seamless. Here is my post from another thread about the seamless whiners   The RCV1000R in GP never had the seamless. Not even all the GP bikes on the grid have a seamless. Suzuki is still working on theirs and Aprilia only recently got one last race, same with Yamaha last year and even that one isn't perfected yet. I am pretty sure some satellites don't have it either.  Seamless was developed in GP because dual clutch is banned. Knocking this bike because it has no seamless when its only $180K just shows how out of touch people are with GP and what they are complaining about.  Honda has a freaking tech at each team that works on that gearbox. The satellite teams aren't allowed to even LOOK at it, that is how high end that tech is and you are disappointed this bike being sold to the public doesn't have it? Lolwut tell me you are joking.  Its still a transmission actually used in GP as recently as last year. Hell it probably has a more up to date chasis and components than the RCV1000R. You do realize the RCV1000R was a $1,000,000+ package right?   As for    Even the customer GP bikes have pneumatic valves now   Only since THIS year in GP. The RCV1000R was standard valves. Also pneumatic valves are totally unrealistic for a road going bike in terms of servicing.   It seems to me you (and the general public) are on one hand, complaining that this bike isn't close enough to a real GP bike, but on the other hand are also complaining about the price. That is the most asinine logic. You want a 100% GP bike, along with all current proprietary knowledge and tech (seamless) for the price a R1? or $50,000? Get freaking real.   So back to my original point, race shit is expensive. That is why Honda, and all other competitors spend millions upon millions racing in GP.

No. It's like saying frame tech has always trickled down. Well... maybe it wouldn't have in this case since CBRs don't use V4s (though Suzuki did put the GSXR 750 into what was basically a modified RGV500 GP frame). I've always thought that was weird. Why make these prototype racers/testbeds v4s when your flagship superbike is an I4? Duc has an excuse since the rules require 4cyls and their road bikes have only ever come with twins.

If you're going to pay $180k for a motorcycle, are you really going to worry about how you need to keep your air valves valving? This is your toy. It's like a super-exotic car that needs a $1500 oil change every 500 miles. You don't care because it's a status symbol you use for recreation.

Ok so you want a street bike with the full gp spec piston and rod set? full high compression, aggressive cam, with pneumatic valves & high idle speed? It is LITERALLY impossible to ecu tune a full race motor with 0 modifications to pass an emissions test. ignoring the fact it would need to go through a 30+ minute warmup procedure before every ride or risk grenading the engine."

Any one can lowside and those behind them would not have enough time to react evasively. This is especially true in the beginning of a race and in very close battles.   Marc's Argentina lowside could have had the same result if Dovi had been keeping pace with Rossi. The same can be said for his lowside in Misano last year. Fortunately the top level guys are skilled enough to take an evasive line while not losing control or position.   Even further back to Dani's dramatic high side in Aragon 2013 Rossi, Crutchlow, and Bautista were skilled enough to avoid him sprawled on the ground. Had they been a few seconds closer Dani might have had a worse fate.

motogp,39tt58,johnmflores,5,Sun Jun 14 23:23:40 2015 UTC,The greatest thing about Lorenzo is that he'll carry that same line every lap. Amazing rider.
motogp,39tt58,Deacon46,2,Sun Jun 14 23:51:56 2015 UTC,This is why I believe he is currently the best driver on the grid. It is remarkable how he can consistently bang in fast lap times lap after lap. Those who have already raced a bike around a track should know that riding on the same lines every lap is nearly impossible.
motogp,39tt58,FullBlownErectionBBQ,2,Mon Jun 15 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"It's hard to know who is the best. Marquez has the aggression and determination that can be needed in a battle or qualifying scenario. Lorenzo has the precision and consistency to pull out the perfect race. But, I feel that Rossi is a mixture of both of them. He has the aggression in a battle (obviously not qualifying) and, as proven on Sunday, can match or better Lorenzo's consistency in the race."
motogp,39tt58,Deacon46,2,Mon Jun 15 19:06:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah who is the 'best' is debatable, however its clear Lorenzo, Rossi and Marc have moved on what it takes to be at the top of Motogp.  Both Lorenzo and Rossi have gone though some soul searching over the last few years and come out stronger riders because of it."

motogp,39tq2z,Terra27,0,Mon Jun 15 07:04:34 2015 UTC,Doing 170 even on a straight line would make you shit your pants. Doing it at lean with the back stepping out and the front folding requires 3 fucking huge balls.

motogp,39tuga,sloCycle,5,Sun Jun 14 18:43:21 2015 UTC,for real where does all that power come from? the desmo?
motogp,39tuga,GalacticInquisitor,8,Sun Jun 14 21:30:00 2015 UTC,"Ducati always has had the top speed in MotoGP. Desmodromic valves used to allow them to run higher RPM's compared to normal spring-type valves. Right now with the pneumatic valves used by almost all manufacturers that's not a difference anymore, but Ducati can use 12 engines, (compared to 5 for Honda and Yamaha) and has 22 litres of fuel compared to 20 for Honda and Yamaha. This means they can run higher revs. For every engine Honda and Yamaha ""destroy"" (do not use anymore, either because it needs servicing or they actually blew a hole in a cilinder) Ducati can destroy 2.4 engines. More fuel also means more power, since they don't have to manage it as efficiently as the factory teams have to."
motogp,39tuga,Hephoran,2,Sun Jun 14 22:19:06 2015 UTC,Why is duc allowed more engines?
motogp,39tuga,MamaTR,10,Mon Jun 15 00:20:06 2015 UTC,"They haven't been competitive for quite some time, so these concessions are allowing them to experiment a bit more until the playing field levels out. Once they take a race, they'll lose the concessions."
motogp,39tuga,Hessquire,4,Mon Jun 15 00:50:57 2015 UTC,"So like a handicap? Wow thats interesting that the organisation does that. Its not like you see that in soccer or basketball, ""Ok because the other team has Messi, you are allowed two goalies during the second half."""

motogp,39tuga,deelowe,5,Mon Jun 15 04:11:36 2015 UTC,"MotoGP was dying. Big manufacturers like Kawasaki and Suzuki to name a couple were leaving. Yamaha and Honda were just so dominant it made for a boring series (a la F1 the last few seasons). That is why people give so much credit to Casey Stoner because he was able to make gold out of shit on the older Ducatis - almost like some are saying about Marquez and Honda right now (though his experience and age are showing the last few races).   With rule changes in fuel, ECUs, tire allocation, engine quantities, etc they are trying to level out the playing field to make it more interesting. So while you think it is BS, if they hadn't you can bet your ass MotoGP wouldn't see the growth it has in the last 2-3 years without it. Hell, because of those rules some of the manufacturers are even coming back like Suzuki, Aprilia and KTM. I wish the focus was even more rider skill than the machine they sit on, but I'll take what I can get."

motogp,39tuga,Left_Afloat,5,Mon Jun 15 11:26:19 2015 UTC,Oddly enough Ducati has been the most exciting bike to watch this year. Constant multi-pass battles.
motogp,39tuga,Armonster20,3,Mon Jun 15 03:20:24 2015 UTC,Dovi at Qatar vs. Rossi/Yamaha Iannone at Mugello vs. Marquez/Honda  Seems like they have a very balanced bike to sort out.
motogp,39tuga,cantpee,2,Mon Jun 15 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"Iannone vs Marquez at Le Mans was the better battle, IMO."
motogp,39tuga,Deacon46,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:37:57 2015 UTC,I think the Dovi/Rossi battle was a bit more rewarding for me to watch.  The Iannone/MM scrap was just that: two guys slugging it out to see who comes out ahead. The Dovi/Rossi battle was like a chess game: taking position to set up for a final overtake two laps away. It was brilliant.
motogp,39tuga,cantpee,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:12:05 2015 UTC,I agree that the Rossi-Dovi battle was better. I was speaking in terms of Marquez-Iannone.

In the wet, the lighter bikes can come close at some circuits. Well, the 250 2-strokes definitely used to get close to the MotoGP/500cc times around circuits in the wet."

motogp,39uuwc,irrelevantPseudonym,3,Tue Jun 16 13:54:46 2015 UTC,You can ride it but it doesn't mean that you will be able to handle it. I remember an old article in the magazine on Mick Doohan's bike that the brake and throttle was super sensitive. it was either you spun your wheel all the way or throw you from the bike because of the brake.
motogp,39uuwc,kruzztee,2,Tue Jun 16 15:54:58 2015 UTC,You're forgetting you need 90% of their pace to get proper heat into the bridgestones. Then it becomes a matter of trust with the front as the secret into getting times is seeing how far you can take the brakes on them. Even if you have an electronics system tailor-made for you so it won't kill you all it takes is a slight slide on the rear (like Aleix) and you can go flying.

Figured, ""Meh, it's not like it's going to change the race."" No. Wrong.   Fox Sports changed the race. Fucking 8 laps in, THEY GO TO FUCKING COMMERCIAL BREAK. Seriously? What the fuck? They come back and the commentators are just casually saying, ""Oh yea, so-and-so gained a position blah blah blah."" Fucking livid.   Since I'm already watching the race, can't turn it off now. If I had the option at the time, I would've and switched to another broadcast. They go through two more commercial breaks before the end of the race. Luckily, they didn't miss anything major but fuck man.  I promptly got the VideoPass next season cause fuck that shit."

motogp,39ugub,Fatt_Rascal,5,Sun Jun 14 22:42:06 2015 UTC,"Surely. Same happened to Lorenzo, and look at him now... :)"
motogp,39ugub,Narilla,2,Mon Jun 15 01:08:04 2015 UTC,I wish I didn't have to look at him now :-P
motogp,39ugub,Ghost_Hands83,8,Mon Jun 15 07:49:14 2015 UTC,"That's the kind of rider/driver fans love though. You know he'll always go for it, rather than be someone that is happy to sit back and consolidate. It's clearly going too far the wrong way this season and he's making mistakes, probably because he's desperate to catch up in the championship. When it works it's great. That's just the nature of watching someone with those characteristics. The team might be more sympathetic if they had someone else at the front but with Dani's issues that's not happening. He's only 22 so he's got plenty of time and learning to do."
motogp,39ugub,chasingchicks,11,Sun Jun 14 22:50:46 2015 UTC,"One of the German commentators, Alex Hofmann, who is a former MotoGP driver and a test rider for Aprilia, said that Marquez did not unlearn how to ride a motorcycle, but that the whole package doesn't work anymore for some reason. The motorcycle seems to set a limit for him which he wants to ""override"". I don't know if it is an issue with the setup, or maybe with his mechanics and engineers but in 2014 everything went so much easier for him. I mean why should he suddenly start crashing the bike like twice a weekend while it was a really really rare thing to see last season?"
motogp,39ugub,LordCroak,13,Sun Jun 14 23:31:28 2015 UTC,"Because the Yamaha is faster this season. I really think it's as simple as that... He would push hard last season and succeed, but this season he pushes that hard and he's hardly keeping up, so he pushes harder... and that's when he falls. I think he will learn that sometimes you have to settle, and will start bringing home podiums instead of ending up in the gravel, and then pick his moments to go for the win. You only have to look at Rossi for the perfect example of this - he's got that much experience, he knows when he's got a chance, and when he needs to just settle, and consequently he's still leading the championship, despite only having won 2 races. Marquez however, who I'd say has almost the same pace is way down, because he hasn't yet learned that not every race is winnable!"
motogp,39ugub,ross_rossifumi,8,Mon Jun 15 01:31:42 2015 UTC,"Marquez was the same last season too now I think about it, but it was just less obvious given the large advantage he had on the Honda. That crash at Misano was exactly the same sort of thing as his crashes this year - not accepting that he can't run the pace of other riders.  One thing I've noticed is that as soon as any young rider moves up a class and starts winning, the commentators will always remark about how mature they are, and we've heard no end of it about Marquez. It now appears that he is the opposite of a mature rider - let's face it, it was obvious anyway, we were just too impressed with him to notice.   I'm sure things will change pretty soon though, he should realise that if he'd ridden for points he could have 50 more points than he does right now, and still easily be in contention for the title. Nakamokto/Suppo must have pointed that out to him by now, and I would imagine they would have done so in a less than happy manner."
motogp,39ugub,LordCroak,6,Mon Jun 15 03:56:31 2015 UTC,"What's interesting is that he is quite mature in other aspects. He'll always admit when a mistake was his fault, he doesn't get angry at other riders for making mistakes that affect him, and he never seems to throw a tantrum when things don't go his way (the closest was when he threw his hat after missing QP2 at Mugello, and that's pretty mild considering).   And yet with all that said, his maturity on the track is still lacking... He's still a hot headed young guy who can't deal with taking 2nd place. No doubt he will mellow, I just hope he does it before he gets hurt in one of these crashes!"
motogp,39ugub,GingerB237,5,Mon Jun 15 04:57:25 2015 UTC,Didn't Casey Stoner have the same attitude that he admitted to? Isn't he considered one of the greats?
motogp,39ugub,tvscream,2,Sun Jun 14 22:31:33 2015 UTC,"Yes he does.  He said it himself, he's out there for one thing, and its to win.  Bringing home the champion title is just an award for winning. That's similar to what he says in ""Fastest""."
motogp,39ugub,chostings,3,Tue Jun 16 10:38:05 2015 UTC,Do people consider him great for being a double world champion or great because he did it on the Ducati?

motogp,39ugub,montyzac,0,Mon Jun 15 06:08:51 2015 UTC,How can he be in the job he's in and not realise that he only needs to be scoring the best points he can to stay in with a chance of winning the title! He can't seriously think he has to win every race :-S
motogp,39ugub,montyzac,1 point,Mon Jun 15 07:41:53 2015 UTC,"Only Marc knows what's going on in his head. Seriously I had so much hope that this third DNF would be a wake up call for him, but nope.  I feel like it definitely has to do with age and maybe his lack of experience riding a less competitive bike. Not completely UNcompetitive, just.. less so - which I guess is sort of worse in a sense that he's always SO close to catching up to the Yamahas and even Ducatis, but cannot actually do so, as compared to him just completely being out of it. Nobody likes being teased. Also with him, I always get a sense of.. idk, like he's young! He's eager! He's full of hope and positivity! Maybe he just truly, truly believe in an almost naive way that if he just believe and try his best and be himself, he can do it! Or maybe he's just stubborn. Again, only he knows."
motogp,39ugub,montyzac,1 point,Mon Jun 15 14:56:34 2015 UTC,With how far he is (and already was) he does need to win every race. These guys don't care about finishing 2nd or 3rd in a championship. He'll gladly gamble being at the top or falling off.
motogp,39ugub,montyzac,0,Wed Jun 17 09:24:50 2015 UTC,"He can't seriously think he has to win every race :-S   If he wants the title, yes he does have to win every race.   His job in fact is to get as many points as he can for Honda, those points only go to the highest placed rider, so it matters little if its him, Pedrosa or Cal that finish highest placed.  The only difference he can make is to get ahead of the two Yamahas, which is what he is going all out to do. There is no gain  to Honda if he finishes 3rd and Pedrosa 4th so he has to do what he is doing."
motogp,39ugub,Deacon46,1 point,Tue Jun 16 10:51:31 2015 UTC,Seriously? How long have you watched Motorsport? Notice how Rossi hasn't won the past four races but still leads the championship? Marquez absolutely did not need to win the last two to still be in the fight.
motogp,39ugub,realchemist88,0,Tue Jun 16 20:03:12 2015 UTC,"Maybe you dont understand the way it works? Its very simple.   If the two title contenders earn more points than him the gap grows, if he earns more points it shrinks.   He wont shrink the gap by finishing behind the two riders that keep winning and if either of those two are leading, he has to win to earn more points. Get it?   He either finishes ahead of them, or hopes that they crash. That's it.  There is little comfort in being mathematically in with a chance when momentum and consistency is in two other riders favour."
motogp,39ugub,gnualmafuerte,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:15:30 2015 UTC,So you're saying he's better off with zero points than 16 or 20?
motogp,39ugub,dustyshelves,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"Not better off, of course not. That's a daft thing to assume I said when clearly I didn't.   In terms of making an actual challenge for the championship, riding for points won't win him it and it makes little difference in the constructors championship.   That approach of riding for points would work if the leaders had at least some inconsistency and you knew you could limit your own damage by picking up a third because you knew you could win at the next round.   Good example is Rossi in the last few races. He had a lead which has now gone, however he knows chances are the win will be between him and Lorenzo, so he can balance a second place knowing this, a dnf for either would be devastating to their chances.   Anyone other than those two are not competitive enough race after race this year to have the luxury of going for points and still be in with a shot at the title."
motogp,39ugub,gnualmafuerte,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:18:20 2015 UTC,"Riding for points works full stop, I don't get how you think it can't. The Honda as a bike is shaky at the moment. He should be riding for points until it's sorted. The bike can't win at the moment, so why try and force it to."
motogp,39ugub,dustyshelves,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"Well he can't see it either so maybe you better tell him that you know better about winning MotoGP championships? How many you on now?   As for the bike, it has won this year, also Marc set the fastest lap of the race in the short time he was in it. So the bike can win and he knows it's capable, but he also will know the title fight is over. So he has nothing to gain from a third and nothing to loose from a crash and he wants to win.   The bikes issues are said to be with the engine because the fly wheel is too light, they can't change that."
motogp,39ugub,Gundamnitpete,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:13:33 2015 UTC,"I think we'll just have to agree to disagree! I'll be chasing my second championship btw, just waiting for MotoGP '15 to come out!"
motogp,39ugub,montyzac,2,Wed Jun 17 19:05:29 2015 UTC,I don't mind him overriding it once no other rider gets taken out.
motogp,39ugub,dustyshelves,2,Sun Jun 14 23:36:49 2015 UTC,"A couple of cliches for you guys that nonetheless are relevant -""No one remembers second place"" -""Second place is the first place loser""  No one is going to give a crap a few years from now if he finished 2nd in the 2015 season. Anything other than championship #3 would be a disappointment.   Mathematically, gunning for first place is the only way he can possibly win the championship. There are 11 races left and if he finished 1st and Lorenzo 2nd in every remaining race he would still lose the world championship by ~15 points. Even before Catalunya, with the same analysis, he would only be winning the championship by about the same margin. Obviously this analysis is very rough but you get the idea. He has no room for anything other than winning.  Besides, these lowsides are cheap for Honda and even when crashing he gets as much on-air-time as the other riders. I'm sure that's all that really matters to the sponsors. I doubt Repsol is going to lose business because Marquez crashes."
motogp,39ugub,keoke916,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and it is what has lead me to dislike him lately. The second he was in 2nd place, I told myself ""This idiot is going to go too hard after Lorenzo and crash out"". The moment he crashed, I was wondering if how is he keeping this shit up? I don't know exactly what the internal politics of a motogp team are like, is he maybe a fucking diva and nobody dares tell him the fucking truth? Or he's been told and he ignores it? I know it's a very unlikely thing, and not even sure if they are contractually allowed to do such a thing, but he needs a fucking timeout. ""Yes, you are being replaced for the remainder of the season, if you stop acting like a spoiled brat we might let you race again in 2016""."
motogp,39ugub,gnualmafuerte,3,Sun Jun 14 22:26:43 2015 UTC,"I feel like part of the reason may be because of the bike itself. Maybe Honda feel bad for their bike being not competitive enough. There have been so many comments out there blaming the bike more than Marquez for his form this year, even from fellow riders. I feel like this last race is 100% Marc's fault though. I was actually rooting for his aggressive style (I know it's dangerous, but it just makes for more entertaining races and he has always seemed to be able to pull it off) but yesterday made me change my stance. He's a good kid, I don't think he's a diva but maybe Honda do not dare to put him in his place because of the bike problems and him still being the rider who brings in more points. Hopefully Dani's comeback will change that. I'm sure Marc has already realised that they have been opposites when it comes to their attitude / principle in the last two races, and look at the results. Dani got 29 points and Marc none. Even if he had ""won it"" once and ""binned it"" the other he would still only get 25 points, and this would still have been a lesson. But nope. Binned it both times and now an intervention is what he needs."
motogp,39ugub,LordCroak,2,Mon Jun 15 04:49:01 2015 UTC,"Honda is having horrible problems with its Bike. Marc knows about this, and his skills still allow him to ride the bike competitively. Think about Marquez's results this season:   5 1 DNF 2 4 DNF DNF     That is, two podiums, two top 5, and 3 DNF. The result: Everyone's talking about Honda's problems, turning it into a crisis and a PR nightmare for Honda, specially at a time when their are presenting the RC213V-S.   What could have been if he had accepted the bike's limitation, and raced reasonably:   5 1 2 2 4 4 3  4 Podiums and 3 top 5. What could've been ""Not as good as last season, Honda is having some issues finding the right settings for their bikes, and the competition has been getting stronger, but we're only halfway through the season, they are still on the race"" became ""Honda is experiencing the worse crisis ever, everybody panic""."

It doesn't matter who it is, only the highest points rider gets added to the total.   If he had sat back and accepted 3rd, doesn't change the result for Honda, he had to go for the win or at least break Lorenzos rhythm of fast lap after fast lap."

This year has been virtually thrown away already, the only way to make a comeback would be winning almost all of the remaing races which looks very unlikely with both Yamaha men doing so well.  Taken from Motomatters, ""Back when Wayne Rainey was winning title after title on the Yamaha YZR500, all the while complaining about what a terrible bike it was, his team manager Kenny Roberts kept telling him that until he stopped winning, Yamaha's engineers weren't going to take a blind bit of notice.""   Might as well show how fast the rider is and then blame the bike because it is flawed. If he gets lucky and the bike stays under him the whole race he might be in with a shot at the win. Honda will work a lot harder if the results are not coming, they are taking heat from the press and the rider is stomping around the gravel with his arms thrown up."
motogp,39ugub,KingLuis,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"I think his riding style has definitely grown more and more conservative with each passing race. But at the same time you have to remember that he rode for two years flat out with his crazy style and he was rewarded amply for it.  Now the bike isn't there and he has to rewrite his entire riding style around it. But it's not like HRC is telling him ""well, be Dani now, this is just the way it's gonna be"". Every race they're probably saying, ""Well we put these new parts on it, so maybe the bike is fixed and you can get back to being Marc"". His style is so volatile and extreme that he pretty much needs to try it to see if the bike can support it. And with both his and HRC's championship pretty much out the window unless he starts winning like '13 and '14, why not go for it? At this point there's no reward for riding conservatively."

It seems like more people are complaining about Lorenzo in general though, esp about his personality.  I truly respect the guy as a rider. The way he rides is just flawless, same line every lap, very smooth, effortless, consistent, et cetera et cetera. He makes ONE mistake like, every other race. TOPS. When he's in front, the only chance of him not winning is if another rider somehow miraculously catches and overtakes him (or if his robot battery dies. lol jk I'm sure there's a backup battery in there), because you don't and can't expect him to make a mistake.  However, I spend two laps admiring his skills and lines and those slow mo clips and the other 22 rolling my eyes and sighing and being miserable every time they show how much wider his gap has become. Really, the most exciting part of every race he's won this year does not involve him, and that speaks volume."
motogp,39u4gr,dustyshelves,0,Mon Jun 15 05:23:11 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you weren't a fan of Casey Stoner either.  His wins were essentially from pulling a large gap and managing from the front.  Why battle when you are so much faster than everyone else. JL and Casey have a very similar career trajectory.  Both are double champions, both are insanely fast, both will take the win if they get out front, and both have scored more wins then Rossi since coming to the MotoGP class, with Stoner at 38 career wins in GP since he came in in 2006 and Lorenzo at 37 since 2008. And more importantly, both have a personality that people dislike.  Racing is about one thing and that is win. The guys who are complaining about his personality (not saying you are) are just looking for reasons to dislike the guy. As someone else said earlier in a different thread, I hope Lorenzo goes full heel and just starts taunting riders. Lmao. It would be amazing. I would also love to see Cal turn heel because he's got the attitude for it. Dude is quite frank."

His career is so long you really have to wait to see how it pans out. The guy has outlasted how many generation's of riders and is still a title challenger. It is insane.   Forget Agostini, that era was even more horribly imbalanced. Rossi IMO is currently the GOAT for what he has achieved. Cases for Stoner etc are all would've, could've, should've. Rossi has done and currently does. The guy laps as fast as top form Lorenzo ffs."

Maybe it's because of time being an excelent healer or scars? lol but back then I wasn't paying any attention to anything off camera, so I would have missed all the news or comments that he makes that might make me dislike him. I only found out through here that apparently he was quite whiny.  Yep, it's quite a silly thing to complain about. ""NO! NOT SO FAST!"" when the whole point of the sport is to BE FAST. But the audience definitely prefer battles. Most of us do watch this as a form of entertainment. As silly as it sounds, I wonder if he can just do us all a huge favor and humour us and at least pretend to not be that far ahead. I feel like that alone will do wonders to his popularity. Yes, this is an idiotic, unreasonable request lol.  I don't know much about what Cal's personality like but lately every time I see an LCR Honda bike crash I just go ""Oh there's Cal again"" I read on another thread that he had a bad spell at Ducati too?"
motogp,39u4gr,dustyshelves,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:44:55 2015 UTC,"Cal didn't really get a feel for the Ducati until the end of the season.  He just couldn't get that bike to turn the way he wanted and it took him almost the entire season to adjust.  Once he did adjust you were able to see that he was definitely fast on it.  Cal is similar to Casey in that they are candid and don't really hold back. The difference is that Cal isn't winning. When you win and you make it known you have issues with your bike, nobody says anything. When you lose on the same bike that you had won previously with the same issues, and you make those issues known, you're a whiner."
motogp,39u4gr,tvscream,7,Mon Jun 15 13:18:02 2015 UTC,"What is it you dislike about Lorenzo? I can't say I'm a fan of him, but I do love how he rides a motorcycle.  Hayden is a really nice chap. He won the title in 2006, despite only winning two races all season long. I don't think he's ever been the caliber of rider that pedrosa, lorenzo, rossi, gibernau, biaggi, stoner and many others he's shared the track with are."
motogp,39u4gr,Alpinestarhero,8,Sun Jun 14 20:17:12 2015 UTC,"Lorenzo is an incredible racer... THere is no questioning that. But his personality off of the bike is just lacking. I guess its just how he seems to address most people with contempt. My reaction with him has been along the lines of ""wow what an awesome race.. but hes an ass"""
motogp,39u4gr,Alpinestarhero,3,Sun Jun 14 20:21:40 2015 UTC,"He has a particular arrogance about him, i agree. I felt for him when he wasnt winning but now he's back to it and sticking that stupid flag in gravel traps (gibernau claimed them all for himself anyways) i just want rossi or marquez (or better yet, pedrosa) to beat him."
motogp,39u4gr,gnualmafuerte,7,Sun Jun 14 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"Yup. Both as a rider and as a person he's just water: no taste, no color, no odor, and neutral ph. He simply has no personality, and I'm not just talking about him, I'm talking about his riding. I'm sure if they had enough power in that ECU, they could replace him entirely with a simple script, have the first riderless bike in racing history, and nobody would notice. It would also improve 99's press interaction and social skills significantly.  On top of that, he's full of cringe. The giant hammer, the jumping off the podium, the way he raises his trophy, everything about him makes everyone just cringe."
motogp,39u4gr,iliveonapalebluedot,10,Sun Jun 14 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"Who cares if his riding style doesn't have ""personality"". He wins races. Period. I'd bet you that half the riders on the grid would trade their unique riding styles for a chance to consistently run at the front of the pack.  Also, I don't get why people are giving him a hard time for his personality off the bike. He's a normal guy that happens to be a world class motorcycle racer; he's not an actor. He's just doing his job and happens to have cameras in his face all the time."
motogp,39u4gr,gnualmafuerte,4,Mon Jun 15 06:21:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not giving him a hard time for it, just explaining why few are rooting for him He's just not a likable rider."
motogp,39u4gr,white_star_32,1 point,Mon Jun 15 08:31:15 2015 UTC,"yeah i have always taken his personality off the bike as just being odd (podium jump, flags, etc have always come across as social awkwardness more-so than arrogant). but that could just be a misconception on my part. i like him tho....just wish rossi would get faster in qualifying!!!"
motogp,39u4gr,cantpee,3,Wed Jun 17 14:58:47 2015 UTC,"I don't feel that is an honest assessment.  JLo has one of the most impressive and distinct riding styles in the modern GP era. It's not flashy the way Stoner's riding or Marquez's is, but it is certainly his defining attribute on the track.  Love watching this guy. Next time someone has the pace to engage him in a battle, check out his racing line and some of the extremely bold, on-limit moves he can pull off. Then tell me his riding style is vanilla. I honestly believe he will go down in GP history for his riding style alone, to say nothing of his 4 WCs."

He wants to be in the premier class more than he wants to win something he perceives as easier. Maybe that's just pride talking, especially since he still has that trophy from 2006 sitting on a shelf. But I like that he's willing to go out and fight for a seat and fight for points not wins, all just because he needs to race more than he needs to win."

Not sure how much of the recent results can be blamed on that but I'm just glad he is still able to do what he is doing. Best case scenario is the coordination of his wrist improves and he can stay relatively competitive for a few more years because there are no americans left to fill the void.

As for Lorenzo, I didn't like him at first but I've come to enjoy watching him, especially when he's in that zone he's in now. Just flawless lap after lap."
motogp,39u4gr,silvoslaf,2,Sun Jun 14 21:55:06 2015 UTC,I feel the exact same. I'd rather see VR46 winning but it's fun to see Lorenzo at the front and competing again.

motogp,39u4gr,keoke916,-11,Sun Jun 14 20:32:50 2015 UTC,"I still don't think Lorenzo belongs amongst the greats. Is he talented? Of course. But I can't ever remember a time where he was middle to back of the grid and fought his way back to the front. That's a skill only the greats have. Anyone of these guys can run laps with no one in there way. Does he do it a little better then the rest? Maybe but put pedrosa out front and he'd walk away with it too.  Hayden isn't good,sorry. I'd like to cheer for an American as much as you but he's not good. He one 2006 on one of the best bike at the time and only on the fact that he crashed the least that season."

motogp,39u4gr,lsotnemem,3,Mon Jun 15 12:41:39 2015 UTC,This is ridiculous logic.
motogp,39u4gr,alfix8,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:20:11 2015 UTC,Only thing about this is if its so easy for any of the riders to just get away at the front then why is Jorge the only one doing it?  Marquez had a massive lead at  Argentina but Rossi M.D. came back from that to beat him.  Marquez had a big winning streak last year and was on pole for most of those races and did the same thing Lorenzo's doing now.  Sometimes guys just clear off.
motogp,39u4gr,gl0kta,2,Sun Jun 14 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"Maybe but put pedrosa out front and he'd walk away with it too.   Haha, nope. That's Lorenzos specialty, being able to be extremely fast when he has the track to himself. No other rider on the grid can copy that currently.   However, Lorenzo isn't a good fighter. He is a lot less fast if he can't pick his lines freely and has to scrap with someone else. This is where other riders on the grid, namely Rossi and Marquez, really shine, so that's their only chance. Don't let Lorenzo get away and get comfortable in his rhythm."
motogp,39u4gr,tvscream,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:55:44 2015 UTC,Lorenzo isn't a good fighter? Have you seen any of his 250 races? He had some absolutely savage duels with Dovi. Donington 2006 was insane. He's had plenty of battles in MotoGP too. I recall him giving Rossi a pounding at Sepang in 2013.
motogp,39u4gr,alfix8,4,Mon Jun 15 01:52:34 2015 UTC,"People have a very selective memory. They must have also forgotten the entire 2013 season. Jorge was pretty much battling Honda by himself and gave Marc a pretty good beating.  I hate to talk about ifs, ands, or buts, however, had Jorge not broken his collarbone at Assen that year, Marc wouldn't have taken that years championship."
motogp,39u4gr,xuryfluous,2,Mon Jun 15 02:37:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, that was worded wrong. Lorenzo isn't a good fighter compared to the likes of Rossi and Marquez, who are just savage. He said himself that he prefers riding on his own at the front and pick his lines."
motogp,39u4gr,cantpee,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:57:33 2015 UTC,"Lorenzo can battle with the best of them, but he's like Stoner in they don't believe motorcycle racing is a contact sport where Rossi and to a greater extent Marquez will take that small gap and swap paint if they think they can make the pass stick.   Rossi can be very aggressive, but Marc is even more so, where he will dive up the inside and force the rider well outside or into the side of his bike. I was shocked when he actively avoided Lorenzo's rear wheel this weekend when he crashed, I feel a year or two ago he would have tried to make it stick and taken them both out"

In any case, the use of language in MotoGP is embarrassing. The commentators don't bother learning the proper pronunciation of places, circuits and rider names, and the riders don't bother learning proper English. I mean, come on! The commentators job is to mention this riders constantly, and they can't just take 15 minutes to figure out how they are pronounced? The riders earn fortunes participating in a sport were they have to travel all over the world, they know part of the job is doing press conferences and interacting with other team members, and it'll most likely be done in English, how the hell do they not learn to speak it properly?"
motogp,39v80n,gnualmafuerte,6,Mon Jun 15 04:06:36 2015 UTC,"Why does it have to be English? Why don't they all speak Japanese, given that the leading manufacturers are Japanese? Why not Spanish, because the greatest percentage of the top riders are Spanish? Why not Italian, because the GOAT is Italian?  The mispronunciation of nouns is a bit annoying and a bit disrespectful at times, but come on. I can understand Jorge and Rossi just fine, even with their ""improper"" English. They are racers, not linguists. Cut them some slack.  Or, think of it this way: Compare yourself to them. Their English, relative to yours, is way better than your riding compared to theirs."

But it's not about comparison, it's about good enough for the task at hand. My riding is proficient enough to commute and travel. Their English and general communication skills are not good enough to do their job properly.   Not to mention, we are talking about a relatively simple skill.

And not everyone is learning as easily as you are.  And there is a quite big difference in speaking a language in school and in your life (mine always gets worse).  Their job is to ride a motocycle at a high speed and when you finished school on the flow being in the MotoGP business with your little language skills won't improve your English as much. So, they get things done and that's good for them. And you can understand what they are saying so it is no problem for you. You are just complaining about details that shouldn't stop an incredible rider to ride in MotoGP."
motogp,39v80n,servenToGo,0,Mon Jun 15 14:44:50 2015 UTC,"I went to a crappy public schools, then dropped out after high school. I learned English by myself, mostly on Usenet and Slashdot, then improved my accent watching series and movies.  I really don't understand why you are antagonising me so much on this, is progress really so bad? Everyone should learn a second language, specially if you work internationally.  Riders say very little in press conferences in English, they just repeat a few standard phrases, and hardly elaborate. Rossi is a very smart guy, and his interviews in Italian are awesome. Lorenzo sounds less awkward and scared in Spanish."

All I say is, a lot of people have managed to achieve very prominent positions in society because of a certain skill they have, might be sports, music, politics, business, etc. And after they become famous and earn a fortune, a lot of them stop pursuing personal improvement. Sure, they work on their riding, but a lot of them forget about other things. I just think that any public personality that travels and gives interviews all over the world must speak at least two languages flawlessly."

Dani is a guy always speaking English in interviews even on german TV Alex Hofmann speaks English with him. Hofmann speaks spanish, italian, french, too. I am not sure where Hofmann learned all these languages, though. He is a former rider but I don't think he just learned it in the paddock or he is really good at it."

motogp,39suwa,BILLD00R,23,Sun Jun 14 13:00:42 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS for today's race!  Yamaha:  Valentino Rossi is regarded as the GOAT by many fans. He had a terrible 2 years at Ducati but came back to Yamaha in 2013 and has been slowly coming back to form. He's leading this season but Lorenzo has cut the difference down to just 1 point. He has the race pace but is terrible at qualifying and needs to improve if he wants to win his 10th title.  Jorge Lorenzo is Rossi's teammate and main rival this year and they've had a contentious relationship in the past but things seem better now. He's the smoothest rider in GP right now and once he gets in front you pretty much can't beat him, as seen in the past 4 races. Strong contender for the champion this season and unless Rossi can sort out qualifying, I reckon his third GP championship is within arm's reach.     Honda:  Dani Pedrosa is the best rider who has never won a championship. The bridesmaid. He's as fast as Lorenzo on his good days but has terrible luck. He's pretty much out of the fight this year due to injuries but he can still pull off some good races.  Marc Marquez is the ""new"" guy. Technically he isn't since this is his third season and he's won the last two. He's an incredibly fast rider and his bike is always on the edge. When most riders would brake, he accelerates. He's also dangerous, both to himself and other riders and has been criticised for this. This season hasn't gone well for him. He has won once but following 3 DNFs most people have written him off - maybe not wise given his talent.     Ducati:  So Ducati has been known as the terrible bike for a long while. Stoner is the only one to win on it in recent memory and Rossi tried his hand in 2011+2012, unfortunately failing to win. The GP15 was redesigned by Gigi Dall'igna and it looks like there is a huge improvement so far. Fans hope this positive development will continue and they can be real title contenders next season (honestly they aren't that far behind this season either since they're ahead of Honda!)     Andrea Dovizioso is staying on from last season and is a 125cc champion (2004). Very talented guy but didn't manage much at Honda, having some mediocre years there. He has improved a lot though and is doing brilliantly with the GP15. I think he still has some things to show us this season and I can see him taking 3rd easily, maybe even fighting for 2nd if Rossi or Lorenzo have a bad race or two.  Andrea Iannone, known as Crazy Joe, the Maniac Joe, Hard Dick, etc. is a former 250cc champion and is replacing Crutchlow this year. Didn't have much presence in the last couple of years but now he's doing really well with the improved Ducati. Very aggressive rider when he gets the opportunity, especially when overtaking.     A few others I can be bothered to write about:  Nicky Hayden - Very nice guy but also a great rider. He was world champion in 2006 with Honda after a tough year-long battle with Rossi and controversial moment with Pedrosa. Many people don't think he deserved the title but MotoGP is not only about winning the most races but also a battle of attrition. He then moved to Ducati where he and Rossi shared poor results during the time they spent there. He's now with Honda on the Drive M7 Aspar team and it makes me sad to see him so far back.  Cal Crutchlow - Another talented rider who can't stop crashing. Very... unique character, probably the most ""British"" guy out there. Funny too. He's riding with LCR Honda after leaving factory Ducati where he had a pretty bad time.  Bradley Smith - Another British guy, racing with Tech 3 Yamaha. Pretty consistent rider and a very nice guy. His interviews are some of the best since he actually takes his time to explain things instead of doing it for PR.  Asparagus brothers: Pol Espargaró is the 2013 Moto2 champion and is with Tech 3. His brother Aleix is riding on a factory Suzuki. Both are fast and doing pretty well on the machinery they've been given.  Stefan Bradl - former Moto 2 champion. Rides for NGM Forward Racing team. Talented guy but hasn't made much of a mark yet.  Alvaro Bautista - crashmania. Another talented rider but that hardly ever shows because he crashes way too much. If you see him near Rossi or Lorenzo, you better start praying to the MotoGP gods that he doesn't take them out.     Honourable mention:   Colin Edwards - nicest guy in the paddock and I make sure I always watch his interviews. Sadly didn't do much in MotoGP besides a few podiums but he was a beast in WSBK. Retired at the end of last season and is now a test rider for Yamaha. I hope he returns to WSBK."
motogp,39suwa,RC211V,7,Sun Jun 14 14:08:00 2015 UTC,"Great post. I'd add a few words about some backmarkers:  Maverick Viñales is in the same team as Aleix Asparagus, Suzuki. He is in his rookie season and he is slowly making a name for himself. Today he finished 6th (best MotoGP finish), he seems more consistent than his teammate - he is one of six drivers to finish each race in the points so far. Maverick is a Moto3 champion, by the way.  Jack Miller had his breakout season last year in Moto3. He's a tough driver who will never step down from a fight, which also means he is quite prone to mistakes. Anyway, he skipped Moto2 and went straight to MotoGP, where he is riding an underpowered bike. He's doing better than anyone else on the same bike (Hayden, Laverty and Abraham).  Alvaro Bautista used to be very fast and there's a chance he still is, but we'll never know this year, because he's on the slowest bike in MotoGP. He's managed to get 11 points so far (his teammate, Marco Melandri, is stuck at 0), but I don't think he can have a good bike again, considering he's not the youngest driver in the category."

motogp,39rwfy,Fatt_Rascal,7,Sun Jun 14 12:06:37 2015 UTC,"It's so entertaining watching him implode. I'm sure it will make him stronger in the long run, though."
motogp,39rwfy,from_dust,8,Sun Jun 14 12:21:49 2015 UTC,"Idk. I mean I think it's definitely possible that he could be as dominant as Rossi was, but looking at the competition, I'm starting to think that is less and less likely. I think everyone on the grid should be in fear of the day that Suzuki gets their power sorted out. Viñales is the real deal and so is Aliex. For that matter Dovi has a lot left in him as does a number of other riders. With the coming electronics and tire changes, I think the grid is going to be hyper competitive for a good bit. Last season may well have been the last season of dominance for quite some time. Right now Yamaha is in good shape but that's the only stand out. Rossi and Lorenzo have an amazing package right now and it shows, but the championship is very tight between them. Next year I think (and hope) GP is gonna look a lot more like moto3"
motogp,39rwfy,mavam,9,Sun Jun 14 16:31:42 2015 UTC,Rossi needs to catch up or JLo is going to completely run away with this.  JLo should just slow down a bit so we can get another 2009.

motogp,39rwfy,gnualmafuerte,4,Sun Jun 14 13:17:27 2015 UTC,"Right now, there are only three ways for Rossi to win:  1: He fixes his Qualifying. 2: Lorenzo starts making mistakes.  3: We get lucky and get a few races that force a handicap on everyone. That means either Rain or extreme heat. That forced handicap will have a smaller effect on the doctor than on anyone else, like we saw in Argentina.   That said, I really want 3 to happen, way too much sun this season. We need some rain."

I don't like Marquez but had no doubts that he would win all the races he won last year, even Mugello which was a real dogfight.  All the other aliens were falling all over their dicks to try to keep up with him.  Besides, as Rossi proved a few races ago when he caught Marquez, no lead is really safe until its over."

motogp,39rwfy,oh84s,7,Sun Jun 14 12:20:32 2015 UTC,Great win by Lorenzo but Rossi is still in there. He's doing what he needs to do.
motogp,39rwfy,from_dust,13,Sun Jun 14 13:06:41 2015 UTC,Rossis only fault right now is his qualifying problems. To start from 7th and end 1sec behind a completely uncontested Lorenzo is an incredible performance.
motogp,39rwfy,kroatia04,2,Sun Jun 14 12:44:37 2015 UTC,It's kinda funny how he always seems to be stuck behind Pol in the first few laps.
motogp,39rwfy,YamahaRN,2,Sun Jun 14 16:34:04 2015 UTC,"This is Lorenzo's race to lose again. His pace of low 142s and 141s is only matched by Marquez on a relatively new tire. Marquez must disrupt Lorenzo well enough to ruin his flow before the RC213V begins to shred the tire. This can be Rossi's and Dani's chance to close the gap while those two potentially fight it out. The ever present Ducati's are also good podium runners.   Aleix is a good dark horse for the podium by his sheer motivation to excel in front of the Catalan crowd.   If Lorenzo gets away after 5 laps, then it becomes a battle for 2nd and 3rd."
motogp,39rwfy,buhuhilus,5,Mon Jun 15 02:05:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, yes, it is Lorenzo's race. Fortunately, Marquez said that he preffers to crash than not keeping pace so we will have a show. My bet is that Aleix will not be in top 5 at the end of the race."

motogp,39rwfy,dustyshelves,2,Sun Jun 14 12:34:11 2015 UTC,"Serious question.  I've been lurking this sub for the past few races and notice that people who don't like / support Marquez often cite him making these last two series boring as a reason.  I don't get it. Isn't Lorenzo winning by a huge gap so many races so far his season more boring? I feel like at least with Marc last year, yes, he won 10 races in a row, but he almost always had to fight his way up from 5th or 7th or 10th because of a bad start or some other mistake. With Jorge, it's always so perfect and smooth. Don't get me wrong, I totally respect him for that. Obviously not everyone can race like he does, but for me, it does get kinda boring when he's just in front, in a league of his own every time."
motogp,39rwfy,RC211V,8,Sun Jun 14 12:34:36 2015 UTC,No offence but are you new to MotoGP? Because george is hated quite a bit lol. Marc has a much larger fan base here and probably around the world as well.
motogp,39rwfy,dustyshelves,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:11:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely new to this sub. With the races themselves, I just started watching them seriously again last season. I was a big Rossi fan during 2004 - 2009ish but then I went to college (no cable / ready access to the races) and sorta lost interest. His Ducati days also didn't help :(  Yeah, I do see a lot of stick for Jorge here, but i feel like most are about his social skills or celebrations. I mean, it IS a pretty selfish thing to complain about: ""He's always TOO FAST! THIS IS NOT ENTERTAINING FOR ME"" haha. I guess I was also just mad at the obviously bias presenter of my local MotoGP programme. Same thing, was so passive aggressive at Mr. Boring Marc for winning a lot, then has been singing praises Mr. Spectacular Jorge to no ends all season.  Ugh. I just want Marc to get his shit together now."
motogp,39rwfy,bastion72,2,Sun Jun 14 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"The reason he made the last 2 seasons predictable, in my opinion, was that he dominated every race and won by a few seconds. So it was always a question of who was going to come in second and third."
motogp,39rwfy,dustyshelves,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:42:05 2015 UTC,"At least most of the time he didn't just peel away from the competition in the early laps like Jorge has this season. But yes, that makes sense. When you look at the results and numbers, Marc definitely did dominate.  I was asking more about why and how come no one has pointed out how boring the nature of Jorge's wins have been, the way people complain about Marc's wins. Again, I do realise that it's such a childish thing to complain about."
motogp,39rwfy,Disgruntled__Goat,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:36:23 2015 UTC,I don't remember many saying Marquez made it boring. More than half his 10 wins were great battles or had varying conditions (rain etc).
motogp,39rwfy,robotburrito,2,Sun Jun 14 16:13:30 2015 UTC,"I'm happy for Jorge. However, I have to say the season is getting pretty boring. I hope Rossi can step up his qualifying game and give us some battles again. Otherwise it's starting to feel like the 800s all over again where whoever leads lap 1 basically wins the race."
motogp,39rwfy,servenToGo,2,Sun Jun 14 18:40:35 2015 UTC,"How did the Suzukis start soooo bad? I know they don't have a seemless gearbox. I am not even amazed this is madness.  BTW, did Dorna kick out their scripter for MotoGP and they just use the script over and over again with little changes? ;D"
motogp,39rwfy,from_dust,3,Sun Jun 14 14:26:05 2015 UTC,Nothing official of course but Dylan had commented that even bore the new motor upgrades Suzuki had been showing issues with the clutch. Getting all their power to the ground off the line looks to be their new problem. I sincerely look forward to that bike getting its power sorted. It's gonna be so good for the series.
motogp,39rwfy,oh84s,5,Sun Jun 14 15:44:44 2015 UTC,Rossi is rarely this high on lap 1. I'll tip him
motogp,39rwfy,oh84s,4,Sun Jun 14 16:42:36 2015 UTC,Ok now we can say title over. Take away this guys bike advantage and he's a bit of a bonehead
motogp,39rwfy,crshbndct,5,Sun Jun 14 12:02:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. He is still an incredible rider, but crash or win doesn't work as a title defence strategy when your bike isn't 20% better than everyone else's."
motogp,39rwfy,oh84s,6,Sun Jun 14 12:06:16 2015 UTC,Yep. Plus it's not exactly good for a long career or the health other riders. Marquez could still be in contention without all his crashing.
motogp,39rwfy,crshbndct,1 point,Sun Jun 14 12:11:02 2015 UTC,"Indeed. He has crashed out of podium contention 3? times this season. He would be less than 10 points behind, but instead is 69.  It's pathetic."
motogp,39rwfy,lurw,5,Sun Jun 14 12:20:12 2015 UTC,"I agree as well... The Honda is making too much power and does not release it smoothly, that's why Maq and Ped have to wrestle so much.  The difference is that Dani is much more mentally balanced, while Marc seems to be more hot-headed than ever this season. He would be up there for championship contention if he would just be OK with a 2nd or 3rd place for once."

As for the win, difficult to look beyond Jorge at the moment but he might not get everything his own way at the start and could end up in a battle with Vale and Marquez and hopefully Dani plays some part in proceedings."

motogp,39rwfy,Disgruntled__Goat,3,Sun Jun 14 16:33:17 2015 UTC,Jorge and Vale showed today that their bikes are super close and that Vale is at least as fast as Jorge. So the question remains why is it that Vale struggles so hard to qualify 7th when Jorge routinely is on the front row? Jorge should fear the day they qualify next to each other.
motogp,39rwfy,MotoGPCurve,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:26:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah there has got to be something. Either Rossi has a setup that doesn't work the tyres enough over one lap, but preserves them better over the course of the whole race, or something of the sort. He clearly has the pace, the bikes are the same, and it's not a one-off. He's been qualifying poorly for a while now."

motogp,39q8yp,SoftwareMaven,4,Sat Jun 13 19:23:27 2015 UTC,I think this comment says something about how poorly Aprillia is doing...
motogp,39q8yp,OnTheTerlet,2,Sat Jun 13 21:29:15 2015 UTC,Because Suzuki hasn't been gone as long as Aprilia has and Aprilia's last foray into MotoGP was far more disastrous than Suzuki's.
motogp,39q8yp,tekkentool,2,Sun Jun 14 03:04:40 2015 UTC,"Aprillia were supposed to be entering 2016 but they fast tracked it by a year for no apparent reason.   I think suzuki had prototypes on tracks for this back in 2013, they were of the mind to ""do it right the first time"" near as I can tell. Seems to have worked too, sweetest handling bike on the grid, it just needs more power, that's the perfect situation to be in your first year back."
motogp,39q8yp,OnTheTerlet,2,Sun Jun 14 03:10:40 2015 UTC,Their riders are probably helping a lot more as well. I can't really see Aprilia getting a whole lot of useful information from Melandri.

motogp,39pdhx,TetsuoSama,6,Sat Jun 13 13:40:43 2015 UTC,Well to be fair Speed Up made the same ambitious but rubbish mistake of Ducati: using CF for vital parts of the bike. In this case they decided to use CF on the swing arm limiting the rear tyre feedback a WSS championrider like Sam Lowes relies on.

motogp,39pdhx,Dan27,3,Sat Jun 13 18:35:16 2015 UTC,"What is your definition by ""a lot""?   Pretty much the standard English definition; ""a large number or amount"".   Hes crashed a few times in practice and qualifying   That's an understatement.  He's racked up a few crashes on a single weekend.  He's crashed in a few qualifying sessions.   He's had multiple weekends where he's crashed more than once.  We're only six races in. He's crashed a lot."

I did a search to see if anyone was counting and what do you know ... this Reddit thread  came up with you counting.  After (again) understating Lowes crashes this year, you were coaxed into counting 4 crashes by the end of FP2 at COTA.  Well, there was one more in QP at COTA as well as the QP of Argentina and Mugello and there have been a couple this weekend.  That's at least nine in seven weekends which is a bit more than your estimate of a ""few"" and around the same crash rate that earned him the title of Crash Champ 2014 (there's some analysis).  Anyway, it's clear that you have some Monty Python-esque denial thing going on with Lowes.  Weird, but whatever.  The good news is that he didn't crash in the race.  Yay?"

I'd assume that the gains have been sizeable between when Fastest ('10/'11) was filmed and now too. They are down to running different settings at each corner and then changing them through the race as the tyres wear too these days.     Heck you'd have to assume that they have anti high side measures built into the software these days as sensors sample at such high rates and the detection of a high side shouldn't be that hard as the rear shock unloads in a big way mid corner. Just need to kill the power before it regains traction.     For comparison, Moto2 has quite limited traction control (none?)."
motogp,39n6k9,SellMeSomeSleep,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:25:52 2015 UTC,"This was immensely informative thank you. I remember watching a video at some point (posted on this sub?) of Davidsioso talking about traction control and how it differs in qualifying. He didn't go into changes from corner to corner. Are electronic alterations made from corner to corner by the rider or are the programmed into the ECU? If it's the latter, how does the bike sense which corner it's at?"
motogp,39n6k9,265chemic,2,Sat Jun 13 00:07:15 2015 UTC,Automatic (ecu) - the bike knows where it is via Gps
motogp,39n6k9,bluenoser4ever,2,Sat Jun 13 00:36:03 2015 UTC,Pretty sure they banned GPS on the bikes a few years ago so now they just do it via other means.  Can't say exactly what they are but not too hard to work it out from other telemetry.
motogp,39n6k9,cantpee,2,Sat Jun 13 01:58:51 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, they go by revolutions of the rear wheel."
motogp,39n6k9,265chemic,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:56:27 2015 UTC,Front maybe? The rear spinning would put it out
motogp,39n6k9,buhuhilus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:47:22 2015 UTC,"They banned team GPS. But Dorna has a GPS on thr bike and somebsay that you can use the signal from that GPS. What is certain is that settings are altered based on the position on the track. Last year Cal's positioning went haywire and the result was hilarious, too much power on corners and no power on the straights."
motogp,39n6k9,ross_rossifumi,3,Sat Jun 13 07:32:08 2015 UTC,GPS really isn't needed to determine track position; after just a few hot laps a moderately well-programmed ecu should have a large enough data set for each corner to be characteristic of that corner - every corner should have telementary data showing different braking/gearing/accelaration profiles. The combination of these separate data traces should be characterisitic of a particular position on the track I would think.  I would assume that the software engineer just has to tell the software the track position for it to work.
motogp,39n6k9,buhuhilus,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:10:44 2015 UTC,It seems you're right although i can't figure out exactly how it works. http://m.crash.net/motogp/news/201432/1/crutchlows-ducati-in-a-different-place.html
motogp,39n6k9,SellMeSomeSleep,2,Sat Jun 13 20:54:49 2015 UTC,"Adding a bit more to what /u/ross_rossifumi said: the telemetry of a lap (ie throttle % and gear vs time etc) would be enough for the bike to know which corner is coming up as the data ought to look similar each lap, plus each straight is of a different length on a track.    In addition, one can calculate how far a vehicle has travelled and at what speed it is currently doing at decent accuracy (likely better than using GPS if moving quickly + GPS develops errors when atmospheric conditions change unless accounted for) by what is called inertial navigation. This is done using accelerometers (akin to what is in smart phones) from which you can determine your change in speed and thus change in distance relative to your starting point. This data could be calculated on the bike itself and be unaffected by wheel spin or slippage.

motogp,39n6k9,SellMeSomeSleep,2,Sun Jun 14 03:33:20 2015 UTC,In qualifying one isn't normally trying to conserve one's tyre so wheel spin and non smooth accelerations are okay and as such the traction control settings could be allowed to be quite different. Particularly if the rider is getting gains from drifting the bike in qualifying that would eat the tyres up too quickly during a race.
motogp,39n6k9,ross_rossifumi,2,Sun Jun 14 03:35:43 2015 UTC,"The last couple of seasons did see a fair few highsides - not traditional corner-exit high-sides, but ones on corner-entry; due to fuel restrictions ECUs were programmed to cut power on braking to save petrol, which led to the dangerous slide/re-grip of the back wheel that causes a high-side. It's why fuel allocations were increased this year."

At least Honda left the option available though to upgrade it to full spec but at your own choice since they can't do it legally as a company.

motogp,39fwwp,midnightJizzla,2,Fri Jun 12 03:45:39 2015 UTC,"Years ago with cars in Japan, there was a gentleman's agreement that no car would have more than 206kW (in the name of safety or maybe to avoid a power development war?). Some of the cars had a genuine 206kW, some had quite a bit more (Honda NSX?) and others were built to run a big chunk more power out of the box but were heavily de-tuned. The best example being the Nissan Skyline GTR which could have it's power output increased by a huge percentage by removing the restrictions in the computer. And it was strong enough to handle the additional power with the stock parts.    So what I'm getting at here is that there is the potential that the power output figures could be understated by quite some margin or can be increased in a big way with little work and without reducing longevity noticeably."

If Dovizioso didn't pick up that DNF at Mugello, he'd be in a stronger position for the championship. As it stands now, the Ducatis are close together, but also ~30pts down.   That said, if JLo and Rossi each have a DNF, the championship is blown open and it'll most likely be between JLo, Rossi, and Dovi, and mayyyybe Iannone.

Especially because he is, like Stoner used to, very able to already take a second after lap 1. With Rossi's not so great qualifying, the gap is often too big.  Without injury I would have to say Lorenzo. But, my goodness would it be awesome if Rossi could do it one more time."

It just blows the mind to see he's got so many people coming to see him on just about every track.   I also keep hearing rumors that Stoner might be coming back. Just think about that grid lineup, it is going to  be absolutely mental.  Dorna really have made the whole moto series into something incredible, it is not just motogp, moto3 and moto2 also have some nailbiting races. Formula one should have a good look at how motogp is organized."

motogp,39f7fx,YamahaRN,3,Thu Jun 11 11:56:30 2015 UTC,"Lorenzo's hand at the moment looks like a series of straight flushes. Hard to beat that hand lol. Catalunya 2013 would qualify as the royal flush of his career.   Rossi has to fox himself onto the front two rows on a regular basis in order to mount a year long battle with Lorenzo reminiscent of 2008/2009. He's a master of racecraft, but no amount of craftiness can cut down mr. mantequilla's lead of 3+seconds barring a mechanical failure. I mean we saw him in Le Mans try his hardest to get close to Jorge, but he just can't handle his teammates capability to throw down 20+ qualifier laps.   The Ducati's potential is still to be seen. But I believe they will eventually win a race this season."
motogp,39f7fx,mavam,3,Thu Jun 11 12:27:15 2015 UTC,"Probably Lorenzo if he stays consistent. Likely between he and Vale down to Valencia. I want Vale to win it though and I would love a tight season, as it appears to be, down the end.  Seems unlikely that Marc will be able to pull a lump of gold out of the rabbit's behind and I don't think anyone else can reasonably contend for 1st place. The Ducs are good but not that good."
motogp,39f7fx,Fred_Zeppelin,8,Thu Jun 11 12:52:27 2015 UTC,Looks like: Jorge  Hoping for: Rossi  Probably will be: Marc
motogp,39f7fx,OnTheTerlet,2,Thu Jun 11 12:29:55 2015 UTC,"It's so hard to say right now with it so tight between Rossi and Lorenzo but it will likely be one of the two. Marquez should never be counted out as his sheer talent alone could take him there in the second half but he's got a lot of ground to make up. With the Ducatis it's hard to say, I don't think this is their year but if they keep their progress up they may be extremely difficult to beat next year. Though they could also pull of some great races in the second half. Realistically it will probably come down to who can keep it on 2 wheels the longest."

We talked about his wrist and the future of American racing. He was a very friendly guy. Second, we rounded a corner just as Marquez was coming around on the scooter and he almost hit my fiance.

I found that most of the higher end factory riders were fairly unapproachable, even Crutchlow who is scene as a relative clown was very stoic and quiet. I never tried to get near Rossi's garage as it was always swamped. By the end of the weekend I had at least been close to every rider though due to scooter ride-bys.   On an only slightly related note, I got a pic with Azi Farni as well. She was one of the BBC reporters before BBC dropped MotoGP. I think nearly no one in the US recognized her, so it was pretty cool to just walk up and ask for a picture. I also saw Colin at the MotoAmerica event at VIR a few weekends too.

The Espargaro brothers, Bradley Smith, Josh Herrin, Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino. Got to check out the pits and meet the crew as well. Valentino and Jorge only stayed for a little while. Jorge acted like he was annoyed with having to be there. Valentino was as expected as well. Very friendly an jovial for the short time he was there, but actually seemed genuine. Everyone else was nice, but seemed to be in full PR mode. The coolest part was the next morning when I went down to eat breakfast at the hotel, the whole Tech3 team was down there already. Got to sit down and have breakfast with everyone. Very down to earth cool people, but the best was afterwards Bradley Smith sat down with me and a couple of other guys that were there working the show. Super normal guy. No big head. Just one of the guys. Seemed a bit nervous though, which is to be expected. Made me a much bigger MotoGP fan, and a bigger Brad fan as well."
motogp,39chgt,solve-for-x,7,Wed Jun 10 20:58:26 2015 UTC,"Another article from David Emmett on this subject.  I'm not linking to it primarily for the article itself - I think the decline of the RCV has been overstated - but rather because of something interesting happening in the comments below.  Journalist Dennis Noyes has posted a very long comment discussing the process of bike design and testing, but buried in the middle of it there is an anecdote about a Ducati team member admitting to him off the record that Brembo's sensor data is actually accurate.  For those who haven't been following this, Brembo have previously stated that the sensors they fit to all the bikes have been recording significantly higher top speeds than Dorna's telemetry - in excess of 224mph at some tracks. However, the teams have downplayed this data and have indicated that Dorna's official data is fully accurate.  If what Noyes and his source are saying is correct then the teams are hiding the fact that the bikes are now pushing close to 225mph in the braking zones."
motogp,39chgt,ross_rossifumi,2,Wed Jun 10 21:11:44 2015 UTC,"I've been hearing of this difference between the Dorna data and Brembo data for a while now, but what is the significance of it?  Why are Dorna understating top speeds? Could it be to avoid safety implications; i.e. if speeds weren't understated they may be obliged to request extended run-off at some tracks, or change the rules again?"
motogp,39chgt,kroatia04,2,Thu Jun 11 06:33:50 2015 UTC,"I think Dorna's speeds are just speed traps set at the end of a straight away, while Brembo's are what the GPS/onboard speedo registers."
motogp,39chgt,ross_rossifumi,2,Thu Jun 11 06:53:42 2015 UTC,"But as mentioned in Noyes' comment, the teams will onky admit that the speeds are different off the record.  As in, officially they always deny that there is any discrepancy betwen the Dorna and Brembo data. Why?"

motogp,39chgt,xuryfluous,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:55:01 2015 UTC,"this is exactly it. Honda's race times at the tracks raced at so far this year are ~1 second faster than they were last year, where Yamaha has found ~11 seconds and Ducati ~20 seconds. Those are huge gains compared to the Honda. Add to the fact that the Honda riders do not like how the new engine works, this could be the worst year for Honda in a long while as under the factory rules all engine development is frozen for the season, so they are stuck with the engines they have. They may be able to mitigate the damage with changes to the frame/electronics, but if the engine is the real issue they can only work around it now that the season is underway"
motogp,39chgt,Fist_Adventures,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:08:46 2015 UTC,That makes me now understand why Marc has been gambling with tires choices and such to make ends meet. He is having a tough season for sure but I did not realize all of the reasons why.

motogp,39bm4x,k13fer,0,Wed Jun 10 21:49:45 2015 UTC,I disagree. They just aren't passionate about racing and racing does nothing for them in terms of development. I imagine they see it as a waste of time and money to participate in racing.   Which is a shame because their bikes definitely have the potential to do well.   I don't think that Ape is tarnishing their image really. They aren't a well known brand and they are getting what they need out of GP by actually racing. They have proven that they can do the WSBK thing pretty well already.

motogp,39bm4x,MT1982,7,Wed Jun 10 21:49:37 2015 UTC,"GP doesn't really fit into their brand. BMW races not only to win but to push their product. I never felt they had any real passion for the sports they enter. F1 was come and go. BMWS1000RR in WSBK was a flash in the pan to give their bike some street cred before bailing again.  Their line up doesn't really rely on GP to sell bikes so I doubt they will ever enter. They got enough street cred already with their adventure bikes and can always just hop back into WSBK for a couple of years.   What is actually more surprising is KTM's interest in GP. I still can't wrap my head around why. For Moto3 it sort of makes sense but GP?   With Rea dominating WSBK I think Kawasaki actually may need to consider going back to MotoGP's paddock. There absence is pretty glaring given how big of a manufacturer they are. WSBK's field of talent is looking sort of shallow and the competition doesn't look anywhere as fierce as GP. They are dominating again and have titles, not much left to prove there when you are only running against yourself and maybe 1 Aprilia and 1 Ducati.   If I was Kawasaki I would make a serious pitch to Dorna to supply Moto2. Get the brand back in the series without the monumental effort that GP requires."
motogp,39bm4x,Puppysmasher,3,Thu Jun 11 02:41:15 2015 UTC,"Ducati needs better riders. Davies is doing well on it, but Jelloyano (?) has been disappointing these past years.

Would love see Kawasaki in the mix too.  I guess I see the BMW circlejerk now - they don't really compete in any of the premier motorsport classes (F1, MotoGP).  At least Honda decided to jump back into F1 and take their lumps on the way back up the ladder."

motogp,39bm4x,Dan27,4,Wed Jun 10 18:16:19 2015 UTC,BMW pulled their factory involvement out of WSBK to focus on DTM and GT racing. They did everything they really wanted for their street bike. I guess they're in the same kind of school as Kawasaki - they would rather develop their streetbike offering from production racing then go to MotoGp for any prestige
motogp,39bm4x,mind_the_gap,3,Wed Jun 10 21:49:04 2015 UTC,They did the Boxer Cup for a few years. A track full of BMW Boxer engined badasses. I wish they'd bring it back.
motogp,39bm4x,Zed03,3,Wed Jun 10 19:26:59 2015 UTC,"BMW's presence in the TT is equivalent to their presence in MotoGP - privateer teams.  In MotoGP, Forward Racing and Suter both have had S1000RR engines.  Also about the comment 'bmw waits until victory is garanteed' or whatever - they've had BMWs in WSBK forever, and they're doing poorly. Its a silly statement to make."
motogp,39bm4x,YamahaRN,3,Wed Jun 10 21:07:40 2015 UTC,"why BMW is not in MotoGP?    BMW's official answer is that it is too expensive. Which back in 2011 was quite true. Dorna changes the rules too often for teams with less money to really be competitive. One of the best small effort nonfactory teams was Kenny Roberts racing using a Honda power plant back in the 990cc era. Then 2007 came along for the 800ccs and many of the satellites disappeared leaving only LCR, Tech 3, Gresini, and Pramac. Another formula change in 2012 to 1000cc which saw a massive depletion to the grid lead to the creation of the Open class so that there wouldn't be just 12 riders.   The success of the current rules is yet to be seen in changing tire providers (testing for bikes to make the most of those tires costs money), spec ECUs (meant to make racing cheaper, but the effect might be minimal), and most notably the engine development allowed to newly entered manufacturers like Suzuki and Aprilia.   Combine all this with the fact BMW has only made superbikes as opposed to prototypes, it's quite difficult to entice a great test rider to find the strengths and weaknesses of their machine.   Let's be generous and say BMW makes a great prototype on par with the satellite bikes in one year. Great! but in between seasons Yamaha, Honda, and next year Ducati can pour massive funds into getting ahead. BMW's bike wont be up against same satellites the following year, but last year's factory bikes.   Compare this to IOMTT.  Easier since not as much money is thrown around as in MotoGP or WSBK. With similar worldwide exposure.   The only way I can see BMW joining is if MotoGP's popularity explodes to levels of FIFA football."
motogp,39bm4x,DrFunkyStuff,2,Wed Jun 10 21:08:23 2015 UTC,I heard they make more money selling wheels and accessories for their cars than the entire motorcycle division does. I'd love another manufacturer but I don't know if they see it as something they should do.

Turns 1,3,4,5 and the final chicane are definitely lacking in sufficient run off.

But it is being built as a FIM/FIA track, so they do have the option of racing there should they so choose. It is expected to open in 2017, but I wouldn't hold my breath over it, Dorna won't go over 20 races per season and there are many tracks trying to get in now as it is"

Before he retired, he vehemently denied rumors of his intent to retire. Then a few days later, he retired.  When he keeps denying his intent to return to MotoGP, his fans translate that into ""I'm going to be back at any moment now"".

Right now the IOM TT is pretty popular!  If kitchen is what you're looking for, I've been playing around with some tracks as bottle openers but haven't gotten it down just right.

I think that'd look pretty sweet.  EDIT: I'd hate to have you make a bottle opener and then me end up not buying it. Do you have like a template/design for what you have in mind for the bottle opener?
motogp,3927zw,jermoi_saucier,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:29:38 2015 UTC,"Sure.  The ""standard"" Laguna Seca for example is about the size of a drink coaster.  (3.531 in 3.818 in 0.394 in).  You can definitely find a frame at Michael's craft store.  A shadowbox would work. The nice thing about Michaels is that they ALWAYS have coupons you can print out to get some discount. Shapeways is offering free shipping this month to new customers, so that would save you $5 from them.  (code: FIRSTFREE)  For the bottle opener, I don't have a template or anything but Laguna looks pretty amenable to being turned into a bottle opener. I can add a handle with ""Laguna Seca written on one side and your Dad's name on the other.  If that's something that might interest you I can  do a quick mock up. JUST as an FYI, printing in steel can get expensive fast, I'll do my best to keep it reasonably priced but expect prices anywhere from $25 to $50.  I'll only know for sure once the design is finalized.  If you don't buy it, that's cool, I can still keep it up there to sell (sans your Dad's name of course!)."

It's work. 6 a.m. you show up ready to go, you're on your corner 30min after that and there for another 12 hours with a short break for lunch. USAC and Indy take their marshaling very seriously and are regularly voted by FIM as the best marshalled event on the calender. If you're just looking for a way to see the races up close and cheap buy a G.A. ticket. If you're genuinely interested in how the behind the scenes of the races work then sign up.

Like the others said, don't discount those guys. They're the ""slow"" riders at the very top of the sport. The top 12 qualifiers at Mugello were within one second of each other. More than half of those guys were about half a second away from each other.  The majority of the Q1 times were within one second of that. Yes, 2 seconds from Jorge down to Nicky Bautista makes a big difference in the end, but the likelihood of anyone on this bike being able to match that...?   Now if Casey did manage to pull this off, it would would be really depressing for all of those guys. I hate to say he might be able to eclipse Melandri's times..."
motogp,38ytuz,mavam,1 point,Mon Jun 8 14:27:04 2015 UTC,"It's not so much about comparing the riders but more the machines. None of the open class guys are slow, but Honda are promoting this bike as pretty close to a GP spec machine, so its natural that people want to know how true that statement and see some genuine lap times.  I guess it raises the question about what Honda's overall motive for producing this bike is. With such small volumes, it wont be a big money spinner, and they don't have to meet any homologation requirements for the sport.  It feeds into the conversation about why Honda go racing in the first place.  What we can be sure of, is that Casey will give it a glowing review, not an objective critique as he's 100% on the payroll."

This is PR, and any kind of incident would be disastrous for Honda, they are showing off their new product and want to show it in a positive light. They are not going to risk him crashing or damaging the bike. But forget about crashing, if he seriously rides the bike, it becomes a benchmark, and those numbers can be used against them. ""One of the best riders ever and this is the best lap he could get?"". If instead he just cruises around revving it up, it shows off the bike, people  will love it anyway, they'll love seeing Stoner again, and it's overall good PR for Honda with little risk."

Also, the reason the MotoGP bikes sound so ragged is because of the insanely aggressive valve timings. Severe valve overlap causes exhaust charges to mix with fresh ones at low throttle, making the engine 8 cycle or 16 cycle, instead of 4. That creates the mad cacophony that we all love so much on track."
motogp,38zkbz,mavam,2,Wed Jun 10 16:54:07 2015 UTC,"Something tells me this wasn't the debut that Honda was going for.  Anyhow, I've noticed with many of the mechanics/whomever who warm up the bikes in the paddock, they do the slow blip thing.

Competition is definitely stronger, but I think a weaker Pedrosa and stronger Ducati plays into his favour.   I would like to see Valentino Rossi win the championship. Competition is unbelievable, Lorenzo is very relaxed and Marquez can never be ruled out."
motogp,38yz06,manoeuvre44,8,Mon Jun 8 01:25:51 2015 UTC,Rossi is going to have to improve his qualifying if he wants to win the championship. He's done well coming from behind. If he didn't have to get through so much traffic he'd probably have more wins.

motogp,38yz06,_itsaworkinprogress_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:01:11 2015 UTC,Pure speculation. I think at this point in his career he's more of a tactician than pin the throttle back and hope the tires stick. That hurts him in qualifying but he's able to get close if not on the podium on race day.  I also don't think the field was as competitive five or six years ago like it is this season.

If Marquez is to come back, I feel he needs to reign in his aggressive riding from time to time and learn that 2nd or 3rd or even 4th or 5th (occasionally) is good result, Honda have had their problems yes but Marquez has thrown points away cheaply this season in Argentina and Mugello (35-42) and you can't do that against Lorenzo and Rossi in the form they're in."
motogp,38yz06,kowalski71,-7,Mon Jun 8 10:21:54 2015 UTC,"Who knows, maybe Lorenzo's helmet will fall apart again! *fingers crossed"
motogp,38yz06,kroatia04,4,Tue Jun 9 12:31:21 2015 UTC,"He can and will challenge for the championship, but based on Lorenzo's performance now, I think we're up for a repeat of 2010 & 2012. I don't think Lorenzo will be off the podium for a long time."
motogp,38yz06,Some_Random_Guy_1138,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:23:45 2015 UTC,"based on Lorenzo's performance now ... I don't think Lorenzo will be off the podium for a long time.   I agree. 2 in a row made him a title contender. 3 in a row, a title favourite."
motogp,38yz06,robotburrito,5,Mon Jun 8 19:51:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is too late. All it takes is Honda to figure something out, a small change possibly. Once that happens I wouldn't even be surprised if he won every single last race this season."
motogp,38yz06,friends_not_food,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:29:16 2015 UTC,you have to remember that when JLo was in form MM always had to fight.  it's only when he struggled that MM was dominating.  so if both Yami's stay in form I think that prediction is a pretty huge reach.
motogp,38yz06,the-minister,4,Tue Jun 9 01:36:11 2015 UTC,"Read (or saw) somewhere very recently that back in 2006, rossi was in a worse spot 6 races down, with nicky hayden leading, but bounced back to lead by 6 points in the championship. He crashed in valencia and hayden won. I think i read this on reddit itself, im really not sure about the source, but there you have it."
motogp,38yz06,cantpee,3,Mon Jun 8 07:30:48 2015 UTC,"If he is willing to finish a race off the podium, he has a real chance. If he continues to push 110% when the bike isn't working the way he wants, he's going to have a couple of more races with zero points. With JLo giving the performance of his career and VR under the gun to win races, Marquez needs every point he can get."
motogp,38yz06,mclovin_eve_lolz,3,Mon Jun 8 14:30:44 2015 UTC,Is it too late already for Honda to challenge anything at all this season in MotoGP?
motogp,38yz06,zikovskisvkr,7,Mon Jun 8 01:07:24 2015 UTC,"not only in motogp , in all Motorsport (f1 , indy..)"
motogp,38yz06,Dan27,-2,Mon Jun 8 02:14:14 2015 UTC,"To be fair to Honda, they have had only one year developing that engine. The best engine in F1 - the Mercedes - had four years of development before it was introduced."
motogp,38yz06,schneeb,-1,Tue Jun 9 05:01:08 2015 UTC,"The F1 regs are fair, that is an excuse..."
motogp,38yz06,Dan27,-2,Tue Jun 9 15:39:29 2015 UTC,But its also a fact.

motogp,38yz06,backwards01,3,Tue Jun 9 18:49:19 2015 UTC,He could well be in the fight towards the end of the season but I think realistically he is going to be the perfect foil for one of the Yamahas. 2/3 of the season left and everything to play for.
motogp,38yz06,exg,3,Wed Jun 10 04:57:56 2015 UTC,Of course it's not too late.
motogp,38yz06,mavam,2,Mon Jun 8 04:29:49 2015 UTC,"I think a strong run of 10 wins again is next to impossible with the stiffer competition and the RCV problems.   Leave it to Marc, though..."
motogp,38yz06,sembello,2,Mon Jun 8 06:48:14 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling HRC are going to surprise at Catalunya. Pedro in particular goes well here, seems to have something extra here compared to other tracks.  I also think Rossi will outdo Lorenzo if the hard tyre is the preferred for the race."
motogp,38yz06,dingus420,3,Mon Jun 8 01:08:35 2015 UTC,"Definitely not too early to count him out. The season is still so young, you have to figure Rossi and Jorge will experience their fair share of bad luck. The title will be a 3 way fight between Rossi, Jorge, and Marc and probably won't be decide until the final race"
motogp,38yz06,Dan27,2,Mon Jun 8 02:19:27 2015 UTC,"Rossi 118pts Jorge Lorenzo 112 Andrea Dovizioso 83 Andrea Iannone 81 Marc Marquez 69  If Marc is to challenge for the championship this year, he needs:  1 - for Honda to immediately fix the machine, or at least score well in the next three races then get the fix by the time the summer break is over and the USGP happens 2 - when he gets the above, he needs to be flawless. Wins only 3 - he needs help with issues with Yamaha and Ducati reliability.   I put the chances of the above happening at around 5% to 10%."
motogp,38yz06,eljefe46,2,Mon Jun 8 01:24:42 2015 UTC,"This is not Marc's year. Last year was (and still is) an amazing performance, but he won't be a serious contender for world champion. Jorge/VR will be duking it out and I'm expecting their relationship will begin to change very soon."
motogp,38yz06,SoftwareMaven,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:49:37 2015 UTC,"JLo and Rossi duking it out is the only reason MM has a shot at all, IMO. If either were running away with victories, it would be game over, but by splitting the top spot, neither has broken away."
motogp,38yz06,My_GF_is_16_and_Im27,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:58:49 2015 UTC,Prolly. I loved seeing his early failures since I figured he'd catch up near the middle or end and there'd be an epic championship battle. But now I'm kicking myself. >_>
motogp,38yz06,CXR1037,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:30:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. He's going to be in ""win everything"" mode and throw away a few more races."
