You may be able to get lucky and find a larger CC bike in your price range. It'll probably be higher milage, and may require some closer attention with maintenance... but it would be a lot better, especially for highway riding.   Good luck."

OP may be able to find an older, carbed, 1500 or 1600 in that price range. If you don't mind a salvaged title, you could probably find a newer, injected, 2000.

Carbed, of course, but all of them list new parts or tires. Not trying to start a fight with you over this. Just sayin they aren't hard to find.   If OP would bump the price range by a grand, he could find a lot more bikes. I payed $4200 for my 06 with 9000 miles on it. Mine is injected, bags, windshield, and lots of chrome. Bikes loaded up like mine, with pipes and tuners, list for around $5000. Book price on mine was only $4800.   Just saw OP's edit. Saw a couple of really nice newer bikes that need engine work for dirt cheap. $1300 for a 1600 that is already loaded."

The solid mag wheels give sideways gusts of wind way too much sway over your bike, and the power output was worse than 900cc bikes.

cruisers,3e4zld,MNRailTracer,2,Wed Jul 22 05:35:46 2015 UTC,"The solid mag wheels give sideways gusts of wind way too much sway over your bike   No offense intended, but after a few RPMs even spoke wheels are 'solid' as far as crosswind is concerned.  Don't believe me? Get an air hose, put your compressor up to about 90PSI, jack the rear wheel of your bike off the ground.  Now start the motor, put her in gear and get a few rpms going.  Now blast the air on one side while holding your hand on the opposite side.    You won't feel a thing even with that concentrated jet of air inches from the spokes."
cruisers,3e4zld,Kaashar,2,Wed Jul 22 11:57:51 2015 UTC,"Well then, that makes it worse, because then it's nothing as slight as the wheels that make the Sabre 1100 crosswind-catching, it means something else about the bike intrinsically makes it feel like it's going to tip in the wind. Top-heavier than other similarly-displaced motorcycles perhaps? Aerodynamic design? /shrug  And that is waaayyy too much work to simply argue wheels. Rule #17 of internet opinions, assume all parties are really lazy!  Edit: Now that I think about it, the hours I've spent on a friends Fatboy, that sucker has solid wheels on it too, and it didn't feel once like the wind was going to shove me into another lane. Hmm."

I've actually done exactly what I described a couple times.  The next time I'll film it and  up it to youtube.  The sad part is I don't, nor ever have, owned mag rims because I think they look hideous.

cruisers,3e4zld,MNRailTracer,1 point,Wed Jul 22 12:32:48 2015 UTC,"It's been said but to repeat wind isn't a factor for wheels.  Spokes are stronger so you're less likely to damage a rim in a pothole.  They're also prone to rust, and more difficult to mount a tire on.  They also add weight but that's typically not a consideration for cruisers.  Those are the simple pro/cons of spokes."

cruisers,3e4zld,MNRailTracer,3,Wed Jul 22 13:33:15 2015 UTC,"$3,500 should get you a pretty sweet Ninja 250... but I kid, I kid.  Let's look at what you're after. A good solid cruiser that will move a bigger guy like myself, 2-up even, plus cargo, you're going to want at least 1100cc, if not 1500cc, or in the 90 cubic inch area for American.  The sorting of bikes that will work for you isn't the problem though, it's the initial expenditure.  $3,500 would buy you, depending on your area, something like a Yamaha Roadstar or a Honda VTX1800, both of these with decent amounts of miles on them but hopefully well-maintained. Low-mile larger cruisers are going to be out of your pricerange. Kawasaki also has their 1500cc Vulcan cruiser that many people find reliable well into the early 1990's for models, so you may find one lower miles in that regards but older make/model.  Harley is out of your initial pricerange, most likely. $3,500 will buy you a Sportster that would probably disappoint you in respects to cost of maintaining a Sportster that has gotten old enough or high enough milage to bring the price that low.  Personally, I ride a VStar 1100 that would sell for around that $3000 mark, but only because it's over 50k miles. It's enough to move me (240lbs) plus the girlfriend (120lbs) and gear. It's great for long days of riding. It's got plenty of pull on the highway with light modification to the clutch springs, intake, exhaust, and larger carb jets. The mods I've installed would probably run around $600 total to do. I also unreasonably dislike fairings and windshields, and it's comfy to ride at higher speeds. Shaft drive means reliability and longevity with low maintenance.  I would encourage you to go look around for a Roadstar, Vulcan 1500, or VT1300 or VTX1800, but expect for your pricerange to be looking at older or higher milage bikes. If you're not familiar with bike mechanics, you'll want to consider taking someone along that's knowledgable.  Edit: Feel free to toss out a general geographic location (IE Northwest Texas or whatever) and we can poll Craigslist for some leads. Gives us a better idea of what bikes are selling for in your area. A bike that sells for $1500 in Minnesota will sell for $3000 in Florida, often.

cruisers,3e33h6,TookLongWayHome,7,Tue Jul 21 16:15:00 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying that the rider didn't do anything wrong.  My suggestions aren't meant to imply that.  Some of this won't even necessarily apply to this video.    When I'm coming to a stop, I keep plenty of room between myself and the car in front of me.  That way, if a car behind me doesn't stop, I have room to shoot ahead and out of harm, or at the very least onto the shoulder or something.  This has come in handy, especially at the bottom of a wet hill- car skidded to about a foot behind the car that was in front of me.  My bike would not have fit in that space very well :)  Additionally, I trigger my brake lever a couple times when I'm coming to a stop.  It's instinct now- just a little flash to trigger the brake light a couple times before pulling it on all the way.    As /u/BassBailiff mentioned, that extra mirror would have gone a long way.  Keep your eyes up front, but keeping your mirrors in your peripheral vision helps with 360 degree awareness.    Long story short, car was completely in the wrong, but there are ways that we can prepare ourselves for bad drivers.  Ride safe!"

cruisers,3e33h6,fox_mulder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:30:56 2015 UTC,"In the UK we are taught that the default road position should be ""just left of centre"" and that when stopping in traffic their should be about a bike length between you and the vehicle in front for precisely this sort of accident (even though we allow filtering). The idea being that if we are as aware as we should be we can identify that the approaching vehicle is coming up to fast we have the option to apply a burst of power and attempt to find space. This very teaching has saved me from more than one accident. Note that in the UK and much of Northern Europe our licence training is very intensive and focused on defensive skills like swerving into emergency stops (for example my full unrestricted licence training took 7 days riding 8 hours a day) and even then many motorcyclists opt to go on to further training of advanced skills and road craft. Long story short give yourself the best skills you can to keep yourself safe, you can't avoid everything but it really helps."

It is just the way it is. You can grandma the shit out of it for a couple years and still drop it by forgetting the dang kickstand or something. As long as you don't care about scratching a $10,000 bike, you'll be fine on either of those choices.  The Vegas will be cheaper purely because of the rear tire. It will also handle a bit better, but you're not going to be struggling to turn or anything on the Hammer so that's negligible. Go test ride each and see how you feel on either. If they both feel the same to you, go for price/looks."

It's a perfect bike for a first with regards to engine size, bike size, and maneuverability. That being said, I would not recommend it for any weight above 200lbs because the acceleration, braking, and agility of the bike will be greatly affected by a passenger, but also on uphill accelerations.  These effects can be countered by mods like air filter, exhaust, and gear ratio changing, which I've done; however, my next bike will be nothing under 1000cc's. I think you should go for the 1100, if you're worried it's too much bike, you can always just ease up on the throttle for the first year or so. Plus, 2.6K is a great deal as long as the bikes in good condition and mileage isn't too high  Hope this helped brada, ride safe."

Very little modification necessary to make it run like a Harley twice it's size. Nothing like damn near popping up the front wheel and giving a $25k Ultra Glide a run for its money. There is a reason it's labeled Dragstar 1100 overseas.   Started on a VLX600 Honda. Outgrew it in a year. However... It was a GREAT bike to learn on.

People also sometimes convert tubed tires to tubeless by sealing the rim from the inside (but if the rims don't have a safety bead to keep the tire on if it goes flat that can be less than safe.)   The reason they want to know is that a tubeless tire is easy to fix - you basically clean out the hole with a reaming tool, insert a plug and you're done. A tubed tire requires dismounting the wheel and replacing the innertube and so on."

cruisers,3d85vj,Kaiakazai,6,Tue Jul 14 06:55:17 2015 UTC,"Well, my first opinion is that you take an MSF course. In fact, maybe you and your wife should take one together. There's been a noticeable spike in middle aged rider deaths due to people just getting a bike, hopping on and careening off into traffic wearing hugely inappropriate gear. So start with the MSF or your local equivalent, and make sure you budget protective attire for the both of you as well.   That said, I'm personally a bit of a fan of the Kawasaki, mostly due to their ""Ergo-fit"" concept where you can specify if you want it set up for short, normal or tall riders. It's a cool bike in its own right, but that sort of thing should be encouraged. It also looks great, in my opinion."
cruisers,3d85vj,cr0ft,5,Tue Jul 14 08:33:36 2015 UTC,I second this about the MSF.  That needs to be taken ASAP.  I vote for Honda on the bike choice though.  I am kinda biased on that though because...that's all I ever buy due to their reliability.  Never owned anything else.

cruisers,3d85vj,VTX1800,4,Wed Jul 15 01:41:26 2015 UTC,"My votes on the shadow.  heres my reasoning.  in 2004 they released the new shadow platform.  its the same bike in showrooms today, besides rear disc and EFI. same bike.  that says ""if it aint broke don't fix it""  which is another way of saying the shadow is one of the most solid, most reliable motorcycles from any manufacturer available today.  I also ride one as my personal bike  whats cool about it, is it is SUPER lightweight, VERY easy to learn on and get confident on, it makes enough power to have some fun, but not too much to get into trouble.   most people get bored of their shadows and want to trade up to something bigger after some time.  my question is why? the shadow is just as capable at being a ""big"" bike.  http://i.imgur.com/6bJFhDa.jpg   stock   (Aero, but the spirit is the exact same bike with difference fenders and bars. same chassis and everything)  http://i.imgur.com/qmWNBve.jpg  modified for bagger duty.  http://i.imgur.com/mhZHGXa.jpg and modified for touring duty, two up.  the little 750cc motor is seriously underpowered in stock form. but with a little work you can turn it into a fire breathing monster that out runs harleys, the bikes most shadow riders ""upgrade"" to.  I had a few vulcans, and they are good bikes, but not as well engineered as the shadow, just plain and simple.   the street 750 is a solid bike but you got the whole harley BS to deal with, and youll only hear people telling you to ""upgrade"" to a less reliable and slow Dyna or RK because thats what they ride and all harley riders need to be the same apparently.  regardless of all that.  first things first, MSF course.  then, LOTS of solo riding before you will ever have a passenger aboard. its a completely different experience.   secondly, none of these 750s are going to handle the weight of TWO riders aboard, not stock. it will feel really slow to accelerate.  the stock motors are de-tuned for new riders, to make power you WILL have to drop some dough into beefing it up. which will come naturally after you've been riding awhile."
cruisers,3d85vj,hondabuilder,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:38:20 2015 UTC,"I see you posted this a few times before, and I can't agree more! I am more personally inclined to the v star 650, for the style aspect of it. It has plenty of power, although I am going to rejet and go with pods pretty soon. I kept up with my buddy on a Harley sportster just fine, was very impressed with that, seeing as how everyone told me I would be blown away.  Has plenty of power for 2 up on the slab in my opinion.   Are you partial to buying a custom intake like a hypercharger or going with pods? Its my understanding that they are pretty similar performance wise? Also, smaller main jets mean a higher top end correct? Recommended mains for my bike are 127.5-130 dynojet. If I went with say a 125 would that mean a slightly higher top end, without compromising mid-range?"
cruisers,3d85vj,IronSharpensIron1978,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:44:57 2015 UTC,"hyperchargers and pods do not ""add horsepower""  the best way to make power is actually to use the stock airbox and a better flowing air filter.  the heads/carb/airbox are engineered in such a way that they make the best airflow. pods pass a lot of air but are disruptive to flow, which is bad for CV carbs and decreases power.  if you REALLY want to make power, what you would do is port and polish the heads, build some sort of ram air setup intake.  the hypercharger is NOT a ram air setup, its purely for looks and style. any claimed horsepower gains are fluff to sell a product. I love the way they look but don't fall into the hype that you can bolt on horsepower.  harleys use an archaic engine design, its very inefficient in factory trim, which makes it easy to upgrade and power to.   japanese engines are much better designed, with overhead cams, more valves per cylinder, better carbs, more power per cc. and since they are so well designed, most modifications you make actually decrease usable power.  they specifically tune the intakes to produce the best MID RANGE power. so the very notion that you can remove it, throw on some aftermarket piece, rejet, and gain top end without losing mid-range is stupid. though lots of people will disagree.  youll find that after people spend money on a product, they REALLY want to justify their purchase to themselves so they fool themselves into thinking its the best decision ever, and praise it and recommend it to everyone.  how many of those people ACTUALLY took their bike to a dyno to compare the differences? almost none.  when we tuned bikes at the last shop I worked at, we dyno tuned most of the bikes after doing custom intakes and exhausts, and they showed massive losses in the low and mid range, for gains at top end. which was cool for a dyno chart, but unusable on the road. who the hell spends all their time at redline? most riding is done cruising at a low RPM, or accelerating from a stop where the midrange helps more than top end."
cruisers,3d85vj,hondabuilder,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:17:40 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot of sense. Damn I was pretty set on those pods too, but I ran my last bike with pods, and I noticed they ran well but never ""smooth"".   Although this is counter intuitive to everything I have learned from online guides, I'm not quite sure where to begin. Obviously I don't have access to a dyno, so I'm not quite sure how to go about these changes with nothing to go off of. But what you are saying makes a lot more sense then all of the bs guides I have read."
cruisers,3d85vj,IronSharpensIron1978,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:11:31 2015 UTC,"best thing to do is to go into the situation by asking yourself  ""what do I WANT this bike to DO for me?""  for instance, I'm building a bike right now that is ONLY a drag race toy. we haul it to the drag strip twice a month and try to beat my own times, just for fun.  in this case, stock engineering goes out the window. everything I do is in the interest of a faster run, more top end power.  my daily driver needs to be fast, but in a different way, I want it reliable, and I strongly prefer mid range over top end, becuase it helps me pull away from stop lights and pass on the highway.   for each of those cases, I tune the bike specifically for the use-case.  a lot of misconception comes from people thinking aftermarket parts are an ""upgrade"" over stock.  how, how is it an upgrade. whats better?    EVERYTHING is a balance of compromises. the entire vehicle was built with that in mind by the engineers. you cannot add power somewhere without losing it somewhere else.  there is no magical bolt-on part that makes the entire bike work ""better"" overall.  ""better"" is subjective and to really get a measure of it, you have to apply it to specific use-cases.  race suspension is ""better"" than street suspension for setting quicker laps around a track.  street suspension is ""better"" than race suspension for riding in comfort on a long ride.  ""better"" is subjective. just keep that in mind when your looking at buying parts. use it to decide if that part is better for the reviewer, or better for YOU and what YOU are going to use it for."

For this build it's to be a daily rider, so my goal is to   a. Gain passing power on the freeway  b. Drop the rpms by a bit at freeway speed, especially 2 up.   In my limited bike knowledge I assumed that increased top end range would in turn lower my rpms at freeway speed. That was really dumb logic. I'm now starting to see the flawed logic in those who made the guides I was going to follow.   Thanks for dumping some knowledge on me! My next question is this, say I end up getting the exhaust I planned, with a k&n filter for the stock airbox, how would I go about finding the proper carb jets and needle settings?   This was partially the guide I was going to follow, and I was going to buy vance and hines cruzers. http://www.650ccnd.com/rejett.htm  Edit: I guess a better rephrase of my question is how can I achieve those goals(similar to your shadow) using only jets, intake and exhaust choices, as any in depth engine work is out if my range of knowledge at this point.  Edit edit: I understand more what you're saying after reading into what you said more, I'm going to look with those goals in mind.

cruisers,3d85vj,IronSharpensIron1978,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:30:58 2015 UTC,"generally its a safe bet to go ONE size up on the pilot and main jets. no changes to needle if your doing K&N and exhaust.  jets are a few bucks each at the dealer, just pop the bowl off the carb, unscrew the old ones, screw the new ones in and done.  a really free-flowing exhaust will lose torque in the mid range. an exhaust thats quieter and has a muffler generally won't hurt performance too bad.  K%Ns are good but you HAVE TO OIL THEM. the oil is what catches the dirt. you gotta take them out and clean them and oil them with the refresh kit.  I do mine twice a month......"
cruisers,3d85vj,hondabuilder,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"heres a small primer on engine upgrades.  60s and 70s motorcycle engines are very simple. they have 2 valves per cylinder, the cam profile is fairly mild and not as extreme as todays engines. the combustion chambers are hemi heads which as we now know are not very good for an even burn. and the carbs are very simple.   all of this combines to leave a lot of headroom for improvement.  these motors respond well to more air, more fuel, they REALLY respond well to stronger spark systems, because the combustion chamber design doesn't burn as well.  so its easier to take one of these motors and make more power than stock.  modern engines have very flat combustion chambers that are computer engineered to burn in very specific patterns according to how air enters the airbox and intake runners. they also have multiple, smaller valves per cylinder which increases intake charge velocity at all RPMs. the ignition systems take second place because the combustion chambers are soefficient now. a stronger spark doesn't usually net a stronger burn anymore.  the entire flow of the head, exhaust system and intake runners are designed by computers for maximum effect.   SOME modern bikes are the exception to this.  like the smaller 50cc mopeds and dirt bikes, those also have hemi heads and 2 valve heads which respond well to intake and exhaust mods.  the 2004+ honda shadow engine is based on the 80s shadow engine, so it too responds REALLY well to upgrades.   but its not like EVERY bike gains power from an airbox and exhaust.  the problem is, it actually did used to be that way for almost every vehicle, and that knowledge hangs around and people accept it as fact for modern vehicles too.  the engineering that goes into modern vehicles is sort of hidden. its not stuff you can see, so people tend to compare it to what they already know, which is older vehicles, which responded well to those upgrades."

For 99.9% of the time you won't need it or notice it, but when it's brown trousers time and that semi is barreling down on you and you grab all the brakes and pull with all your might, ABS will moderate that and keep the rubber down and the wheels turning.

In fact, my personal opinion is probably that these are a bit too much bike for a total beginner, and also that taking a passenger is something you do after a year or two of riding after you actually know what you're doing. But this is now considered beginner friendly and I suppose it's a free country, not everyone has to start on a Honda Grom or a 250.   Now, passenger accomodations on these may be a bit iffy. You even have to pay extra to get the pillion seat on the Kawasaki in the first place. But it depends on how far one is planning to go."

cruisers,3d85vj,cheeseboyhalpert,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:04:23 2015 UTC,"These are personal opinions so please take it as such.   I would forego a new bike as a first purchase, but instead buy a relatively recent used such as '10 -'14. You save a few dollars and when you want to upgrade you won't have quite the same amount of depreciation. But at the same time you have a better chance to avoid a problem purchase.  As others have mentioned, if you are new to riding do the MSF first and consider a purchase after you have completed the course.   But of the three mentioned, here is my take.   You won't go wrong wrong with the Honda or the Kaw. Both are great bikes and very reliable. And both will be good starter bikes, and will be sufficient for day rides and weekend runs. I don't know if I would tour with it when there are so many other options but they are both very competent. And as other have said the Yamaha 950 is a nice bike and you can get a decent 950 Tourer with a windshield and Bags which are helpful for commuting and day trips the wife. I am on my third Yamaha twin so I am a bit biased, and have been mostly happy with them, but you will want to sit them and try to get a test ride wherever possible.   Harley 750. I wouldn't. I don't think that H-D would make a bad bike, but since it is so new it is probably worth giving that one a year or to prove itself.   Whatever you choose, just ride safe and try to remember that you have nothing to prove. You live longer that way."

Takes up space on a bike too of course, but not too much.  I think mom had the big cooler and put it on the pillion seat of her XV250.

cruisers,3d4gyz,ucbiker,4,Mon Jul 13 15:54:43 2015 UTC,Month ago I spent my first fifteen miles ever on a motorcycle running up and down my gravel drive and through the yard. Sometimes on wet grass. Probably wasn't a great idea now that I think about it but I never even slid a tire.
cruisers,3d4gyz,truthandelusion,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:48:56 2015 UTC,"Try muddy roads. And muddy grass too. Never dropped while doing so. And this was in rain, and there were a lot of questionable puddles that I avoided, and made sure I did not stop with the bike at a lean, any lean, or my handle bars turned. I stopped with the bike upright and the tires straight.  And I also experienced sandy gravel roads of a desert. Not a problem either. Again, you must not panic stop at a lean and stop with the handle bars straight. Stop at a relatively flat area. Don't stop with your bike in a leaning condition (diagonal to a slope).  I noticed the VTX1800R rider dropped on the incline, he could have not dropped if he was at least parallel to the incline grade (I mean going with the incline instead of at a slant to the incline), but he didn't anticipate his stop strategies. He/she could have avoided the drop altogether.  Yes, the cruiser isn't meant to be as fast on gravel as the adventure bike, evident of how the rider handled the road catching up. But that is along with rider confidence as well in addition to the type of bike, more confidence is needed with a cruiser I believe."

cruisers,3d3dx5,oreohno,5,Mon Jul 13 05:03:59 2015 UTC,"You don't want LED bulbs, you want a real built from scratch LED solution. It will set you back a few hundred, but in return you will never have to change the headlight ""bulb"" in your lifetime, most likely, and you'll get stunning amounts of light on the road. Legally, as opposed to HID, as these solutions are all tested and approved for road use.  In order to do that you do need either a 5.75 inch or 7 inch round headlight bucket, PAR46 or PAR56. If you have that, you have great options. Not dirt cheap options, but as I said, it's a one-time payment, no burned out bulbs ever, basically.  JW Speaker 8700 Evolution 2 review  The 5.75 inch version is the model 8630 Evolution.   Another good choice for a 7-inch LED would be a Truck-lite Phase 7. They're very cheap now too, and still a massive upgrade compared to H4.  If your cruiser doesn't come with a 7 or 5.75 inch round bucket you could always replace it too.   If the reflector is the right size, changing it out takes 5 minutes - open the headlight, remove some clips, extract the old reflector, insert the LED reflector and reattach the clips and plug. Done. If you have to change out the bucket, you need to do a little more work."
cruisers,3d3dx5,cr0ft,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:49:28 2015 UTC,"Holy shit that looks like a great headlight, now I know what I'm saving for.  I'm running a headwinds led bulb in my stock housing at the moment, and it's great, but I want the beam to be more focused and not so harsh to other drivers.  This one checks all the boxes and it's like half what a day maker costs!"
cruisers,3d3dx5,masterf99,-2,Mon Jul 13 14:13:20 2015 UTC,"Awesome. I actually ran into their website the other night while searching for LED bulbs and assemblies. Just measure my headlamp and it's a 5.75"". I'm guessing all of these aftermarket assemblies have built-in projectors which is obviously a better output than the factory reflective housing.   I honestly don't care if it spits out light all over the place and blinds people because I WANT them to know I'm there for night driving. I put that 55w HID kit on my Suzuki to avoid people changing into my lane without ""looking"" for another car there. In fact, most cars at night just get out of the way when I'm behind them anyway since the height of the headlight is right about where the rear view mirror is.   With that being said.. I kind of want to try a nice high lumen LED bulb that's at least 3000 lumens or so instead of getting an expensive assembly. If it doesn't give me what I want I may look into projectors."
cruisers,3d3dx5,cr0ft,6,Mon Jul 13 06:12:11 2015 UTC,"Blinding other motorists doesn't really increase the safety of anyone, yourself included, though. That's a myth, just like the numbnuts who ride around with high beams on being massive antisocial douchebags. Plus, since you're wasting tons of the light on firing it off in all kinds of useless directions, you're not really getting that much more (if any more) light on the road.   Especially elderly drivers will have major issues with bad headlights. Glare that merely bothers a younger person can be absolutely agonizing for an older guy and older eyes don't adapt at all well from light to dark as you age. And I'm scared enough of elderly drivers that I don't think it's wise to make them go from half blind to completely blinded on the same road I'm on."
cruisers,3d3dx5,TheGDBatman,0,Mon Jul 13 06:16:50 2015 UTC,Yeah I feel you on that. I'd prefer that it light up the road directly in front of me and at least a good 50 ft ahead or so. I wouldn't want it to directly blind people as that pisses me off when people in pick up trucks decide to stick HID kits on non-projector headlight assemblies. But bright enough to let people know that there's a vehicle there without actually directly aiming into their sight lol.  I think in my cruiser I can adjust the angle of the headlight somehow. Right now it doesn't seem to light the road in front of me very well. I may get an LED and try to lower the adjustment if it's still beaming too high.

cruisers,3d3dx5,cr0ft,3,Mon Jul 13 05:15:26 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but that's total and arrant nonsense. LED is plenty mature, it will outshine HID, it will not be illegal and shine right into the eyes of on-coming motorists and it won't take 5-10 seconds to warm up to give you full light, it will go to 100% the instant you turn on the high beam.   HID's suck, and they're illegal. Especially for cruisers that come with round headlights - there are some outstanding complete reflector-with-built-in-LED options out there that will blow HID away and never require a bulb change."
cruisers,3d3dx5,MNRailTracer,2,Mon Jul 13 05:40:21 2015 UTC,"you might be right, last time I messed with LEDs was 2 years ago and they had heat problems and diminished light output over time. I should be more up to date on that before making a blanket statement like that.  Properly set up HIDs with projector retrofits are awesome with minimal glare.  you dont just shove a HID bulb in an H4 reflector. thats unsafe for everyone."
cruisers,3d3dx5,cr0ft,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:09:04 2015 UTC,"Good info, dude. I was thinking the same thing. HID's get HOT as funk. I have HID's in my GSXR and my car. They take a good 10-15 seconds to warm up fully. I got 5000K in my GSXR since I was trying to go for a pure white look.  Any suggestions on LED bulb manufacturers or distributors? Been looking on eBay but they only sell them in pairs although they're all still less $100. Only thing that concerns me is the lumen output. Can't find any single bulb that puts out more than 2200 lumens. I was hoping to get at least 3000+"
cruisers,3d3dx5,MNRailTracer,3,Mon Jul 13 05:48:31 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend any straight bulb replacement, honestly. They just won't work right in a reflector designed for halogen, light will go all over the place and you'll waste tons of it on lighting up stuff that doesn't need lighting, like treetops, ditches and the eyes of oncoming motorists. Headlight reflectors are incredibly precise, and they're made for halogen lights exclusively. So the good way - if not the cheapest way - to go is to get a LED solution that's tested and puts 100% of the light where it needs to go.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzfAqyo6oN4  Some sort of projector solution might be merely illegal (as it is untested) but might work to put light where you need it and not where you don't, but doing a projector refit onto a cruiser would probably be more work than even replacing the entire headlight bucket with something that can take a sealed LED reflector made for the purpose."
cruisers,3d3dx5,cr0ft,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:10:36 2015 UTC,"Yup, gotta go HID. LED runs the chance of melting your headlight projector housing. So does 55w HID, actually, don't get too nuts, 35w will do ya. It's also about color temperature, I prefer 6k because it matches white LED, and I do use two white LED fog lights that kick a lot of ass in the dark combined with my HID 35w. I can grab a video if you'd like to see - the fogs are only $25 for the pair and since they're LED, run on practically nothing for power.

cruisers,3d3dx5,Mytos,4,Mon Jul 13 05:36:01 2015 UTC,"Unless you're talking about LED ""bulbs"" inserted into the normal reflector, which are a horrible idea, just like HID bulbs, LED solutions are now superior to HID. All reflectors on bikes are made for halogen, and only work right with halogen bulbs.   The way to go is to replace the entire reflector with one that has multiple LED's and is made for the purpose."

cruisers,3csrhd,porkrib,8,Fri Jul 10 13:59:02 2015 UTC,"alright I got a lot to say on this, so get ready, ill try to condense it as much as I can.  a few years ago, I replaced my GL1500 goldwing with a 2004 Honda shadow aero 750, becuase I wanted something mid displacement, shaft driven, watercooled, and built by honda, and a good platform to build a touring bike out of that was just as capable as the wing.  I ended up building this: http://i.imgur.com/T26O8LJ.jpg    http://i.imgur.com/mhZHGXa.jpg  I used the memphis shades batwing, with the 7 inch shield and lower wind deflectors. I worked at a shop so I got these at dealer cost, which totalled out to like 170 for everything. I originally wanted a real harley batwing with the inner fairing and gauges and shit.  ok, so while I had this shadow, with this batwing, I bought my fiance another 2006 shadow aero 750. so we had two IDENTICAL bikes. the same in every way besides the shit I bolted onto mine.  I was dead curious to see MPG differences between the two after my modifications so I logged as much as I could.  basically, both the bikes in stock form returned 45 MPG on street driving, 55 on freeway cruising between 60-80 mph.   after I added the batwing, that bike initially dropped to 50 on the freeway and 45 on the street.  then I added the rear saddlebags and the heavy bracket and custom exhaust, and street MPG went down to 40 but freeway went back up to the 58 range.   then I added the harley trunk and front lower fairings, rejetted the carb, put a K&N air filter, and advanced the ignition by 6 degrees and installed a barnett clutch, and street MPG tanked to 38, but freeway MPG went up to 60-68.  the stock shadow she was riding was still getting 55  think about it like this  the windshield is basically a flat wall, at a very slight angle. so its almost no different than your chest hitting the wind head on. the bike still has to fight through that.  if you look at the side profile of the memphis shades batwing in that picture I posted, you can see its got an extreme slope to it and does not look anything like a ""wall"" in the wind.  SOME aftermarket batwing fairings DO look like a wall, like the chinese shit on ebay. avoid those.  I have a theory as to why my MPG skyrocketed after I added the bags and trunk, basically, the batwing cuts through the wind better than a windshield does, but it leaves a larger ""wake"" behind the bike. I filled in most of that wake area with bags and a trunk, which decreased drag because there was less void for wind to fill in.   so there you have it, I had the same question you did, except I had the means to actually test it side by side with another similar model of bike.  I would say if you do that batwing ALONE, you will be more comfortable as a rider, but at higher speeds it will leave a wake behind you and probably won't do anything to your MPG, might even bring it down like it did to me.  but if you fill in the rear area of your bike with something substantial it may help.  you'll have to do your own experimentation but I can vouch for the Memphis Shades batwing being a VERY good piece. sorry youll have to pay full price for it, i know the MSRP is way up there.  buy the batwing, the tallest windshield you can, and get the lower wind deflectors. without them, the wind goes under the fairing and right into your face, its seriously worse than no fairing at all because the wind is choppy and rough.  you also need the order the specific quick release brackets for your model bike.  the good news is I'm prototyping a bolt-on inner fairing that houses a single DIN radio and two 6 inch speakers, I plan on making a mold and a run of these to sell specifically to memphis shades batwing owners in the next few months.  its REALLY annoying to have such a nice fairing but the inside is all empty"

cruisers,3csrhd,hondabuilder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:32:44 2015 UTC,"not a bad idea, just probably not the best.  for the longest time I thought real touring bikes needed to have big displacement. all my touring goldwings were 1100cc up to 1500cc, my big harley ultra was like 1800cc.  then I realized that I didnt just have to BUY touring bikes, i could make one. so i went looking for a modern bike that was super light weight and mid displacement.  the shadow 750 fit that perfectly. its a VERY light bike, so even after I bolt up my touring stuff, which is lightweight on its own, the bags and fairings are all plastic afterall, and my custom exhaust weighs far less than stock. I have a fully kitted touring bike that weighs less than a naked harley.  for ME it combined everything I needed in a bike, I wanted something that looks like a harley bagger, because those things are just sexy, but I wanted it super lightweight and amazing MPG. the shadow delivered all that and after my engine mods it actually outruns most harleys stoplight to stoplight. can't beat that."

cruisers,3csrhd,JediNewb,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:23:54 2015 UTC,"I bought my 2004 shadow for half that price. just 1k.   the deceleration popping is pretty normal for ALL engines, when you cut the throttle at high RPM, it generates high vacuum which pulls raw fuel into the hot exhaust where it ignites and causes that popping sound. it happens inside stock mufflers too but they are designed to muffle it so you don't hear it.  most times, when you ""tune"" a bike to get rid of decel pop, your actually DE-tuning the bike so it forces it to not ignite in the exhaust. a properly tuned engine will always have some decel pop.  if your carbs have an air-cut valve, make sure they are functioning properly, they help a lot to reduce the popping sound.  mostly, running quieter pipes with a well designed muffler is the best thing to do, loud pipes have nothing to offer but the sound."

If you're just cruising and not commuting, I personally don't see an issue with that.   Freeway speeds (65-80, especially upper end) you may find yourself on the higher end of your tach.  It'd be a solid first bike but you'll grow out of it pretty quickly.  Source: rode a cm400t (weaker) and I'm about the same dimensions as you."
cruisers,3cjdbv,derganove,4,Wed Jul 8 12:21:09 2015 UTC,"I'll chime on on this a little bit. A smaller bike is just as capable on the highway and you won't run into any issues where it's bad on the bike. But bigger bike will be a lot more comfortable on the highway because with higher displacement/torque you're going to have lower cruising RPMs. I love my Vulcan 900 to death, but I'd much rather have a ""big boy"" bike like a Victory or a Vulcan Voyager. I couldn't find your specific model on Gearing Commander but the difference between my Vulcan and a Victory highball at 70mph is 4100rpm and 2500rpm. Even a 250 is capable on the highway, but the difference between bikes will be more obvious on your hands at the end of a long ride."

cruisers,3cjdbv,FrankDrebin72,7,Thu Jul 9 12:33:57 2015 UTC,"600 is not enough, not trying to be rude, just factual. your weight combined with the bikes power output will make it a very slow bike with no acceleration on the highway.  purely for your weight you'd want like a shadow 1100 or equivalent Vstar/other metric cruiser.  as for buying tips, thats tough... its your first bike and you're not a bike technician so you won't really know what to look for, or specific problems to the model lines that have their own things to look for.  I'd make friends with a competent mechanic and either pay his time or a round of beers for him to inspect a bike or two for you.  the seller is NOT going to show you all the flaws a bike has, they are trying to SELL the bike, not scare you away from it.  also, its very rare for someone to be reasonable on price from a private sale. usually people ask 100-700 bucks over the going rate so they have some haggle room and make some extra money.  be smart about it, don't just pay your asking price.  another member yesterday asked me if I thought this shadow he found on craigslist was a good deal. it was a 2003 for 4500 bucks. I said hell no and found him 3 more in his area that were many years newer and half the price.  research is everything or you'll overpay and get too little of a bike."

Comfortable and had enough power, but it beat the hell out of me trying to ride at 70 mph on the freeway. Any little breeze, or passing a semi, would just make riding not enjoyable at all. I found myself trying to pass anything larger than a small SUV just because the air currents would send me all over. Now I'm on a Vulcan 1500 Classic, and even with my girlfriend on the back, it's smooth and steady. I don't worry about riding in dirty air anymore, and winds don't bother me until the get up around 40 mph gusts.   My advice, sit on a few bikes. Buy the largest bike you feel comfortable on. With your size, I wouldn't worry about feeling like it's too much bike. I know with my bike, it wants to stay up. It's hard to make it feel like it wants to fall over."

cruisers,3chdeu,avsbdn,2,Tue Jul 7 22:37:47 2015 UTC,"Just my casual observation.  I guess I'm that ""one in a million"" guy who was looking for stock exhaust.  Folks who buy salvaged bikes and then part them out will ask ridiculous money for any part.  They ask $200+ for after market pipes that were trashed in a wreck.  They go up from there.  Honda Sabre in particular seem to bring a premium on anything for them.  That said if you are not in a hurry, list them on ebay and if you can wait eventually you'll get ~$125 for a complete set (plus shipping), assuming they are in like/near new condition.    During my months of trying to find a deal on stock sabre pipes, I did notice Harley take-offs are crazy cheap compared to other models. I assume that's because there are way more harleys than anything else."
cruisers,3chdeu,random_user_name1,2,Wed Jul 8 00:17:19 2015 UTC,"This especially holds true if the model is out of make, like the Sabre (and the rest of the VT1100 line).  I am one of the few that REPLACED the aftermarket pipes the previous owner had with STOCK pipes; I hated the absurdly loud noise the previous owner liked, and jetted the bike for it, just to have the throat, but also the high decibels with it.  So I don't think you are alone, make that ""two in a million"" guy that looked and wanted stock exhaust.  Also, pristine aluminum finish Sabre wheels... I think those also can be hiked up in price, due to out of make as well.  But like selling anything, if you want to sell quickly you post at a low price. If you want to sell at a less of a loss, you have to wait for a buyer."
cruisers,3chdeu,Renigami,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:42:10 2015 UTC,I read 90% of new Harley riders have their pipes changed before they leave the dealership.
cruisers,3chdeu,im-buster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:08:17 2015 UTC,"nope. not really.  think about it, everyone who buys aftermarket pipes is trying to make their bike louder.  you'd have to find that one in a million person who wants to make their bike stock again and doesn't already have the stock pipes they removed in the first place.  the used parts market is FLOODED with stock pipes.  I just bought some stock 2014 sportster mufflers for one of my bikes. paid 5 bucks for the set at a swap.  I also got some relatively quiet screamin eagle performance mufflers for 20 bucks. they went for cheap because they are as big as stock and not very loud.   if its less desirable, it sells for less. no one seems to want stock pipes, so they go for pennies on the dollar.  you're best keeping them for the day you sell your bike, it will get more value out of it if you have some original parts to it still with it."
cruisers,3chdeu,hondabuilder,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:01:03 2015 UTC,Check out Cobra exhaust systems too.   As for your stock exhaust... maybe like $50. Depends on the state you're in. If a quiet/low emissions exhaust is required for state inspection/registration.

cruisers,3cf5kq,pfd1986,13,Tue Jul 7 12:54:31 2015 UTC,"Whoever told you that is an idiot. Slap a set of straight pipes on any bike and you'll get a rumble.   As far as vibration, it's going to depend on the bike. You don't mention what model your looking at. Most will have the motor bolted to the frame with no rubber mounts. The smaller displacement bikes will vibrate more at higher speeds simply because they operate at a higher RPM.   Either way, Honda's are perfectly fine. I don't think they made a bad Shadow."

cruisers,3cf5kq,indecisiveredditor,2,Tue Jul 7 21:48:56 2015 UTC,Every bike I've ever owned with a windshield gave me really bad head shake. The shield blocks the air coming at you in the front but air still goes under the shield and then behind it. This can create turbulence that makes your head vibrate.   Here's a thread I posted with photos of my lower shields.   http://www.starbikeforums.com/forums/showthread.php?p=461993#post461993  This simple mod makes all the difference.

So,  they took the shadow apart and tried to reverse engineer the bike,  but to no avail. Meanwhile,  honda is trying to figure out how to add the engine vibration while getting that signature potato potato potato potato sound that Harleys make,  and succeeded!  So what does HD do?  They turn around and sue honda over a trademark violation. Yes,  Harley trademarked the sound their bikes make........

It looks like I need to buy 3 different things - the x holder part with the ball on the back, the middles part that takes a ball on each end, and some other part. I can't figure out the part that actually attaches to the bike. Plus it seems like with all those parts it will be very large and extended from the mounting point. And it's black :("
cruisers,3c9iiq,cr0ft,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:07:14 2015 UTC,"You need the mounting ball on the bike first, and that'st he only ""permanent"" part of it. There are a number of ways to mount one of those, I chose to replace one M8 bolt holding down my handlebars with a bolt that has a black ball on the end, but you can mount it to the clutch, the mirror or the brake reservoir to pick a few, in addition to a low-tech clamp around the handlebar.  They also do have some chrome parts, at least chrome clutch mount and a chrome arm.  http://www.rammount.com/part/RAM-B-186U might be the thing.  Here's the chromed clutch mount that's an option to the above: http://www.rammount.com/part/RAM-B-309-1CHU  And a chrome arm: http://www.rammount.com/part/RAM-B-201CHU  But yeah, RAM mounts aren't super sleek. They are, however, excellent at what they do.   3 inches doesn't really extend it all that much, and you can angle it.

I've had one for over a year and it's been great.   The chrome bits are new, that's interesting.   You're correct in that you'll need three parts - the bar clamp, the middle arm, and the x-mount. See if there's a kit together on Amazon, the kits are often the best price."
cruisers,3c9iiq,cr0ft,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"The chrome bits have been around some years already, but you basically never see them advertised."
cruisers,3c9iiq,MNRailTracer,0,Mon Jul 6 15:06:11 2015 UTC,"I just checked, and Amazon doesn't carry them. Whoo, $40 for one piece of chromish plastic. Now there's a business model, Ram!  That being said, if I wasn't in the process if eliminating chrome from my bike, I see the value of adding the chrome to the bars. My black Ram mount kinda does stand out against the chrome of my bars and headlight. But the bars will be blacked out this winter, as well as the headlight bucket (but will leave the headlight trim chrome) so for my own purposes, black will work. Which is nice - got my whole handlebar and x-mount setup from a 3rd party Amazon seller for around $25. Putting the bits together individually gets you closer to $50 at present I see."
cruisers,3c9iiq,cr0ft,2,Mon Jul 6 15:32:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're pricey in general, but on the other hand one set of RAM mount gear should last a lifetime. The arms are aluminium though, so you get chromed metal if you get the chrome arms.   Plus the mounts are useful in the car too, just need to put some kind of base in the car - they have a vacuum windshield mount. The arm and X-grip you then just transfer."

cruisers,3bvsmb,VStarLord,2,Thu Jul 2 15:40:31 2015 UTC,"It looks like with that setup the pipes would be shooting the exhaust right at the front of the bag. Depending on the material the bag is made of this could be a huge issue. If the bags are plastic it'll melt them or light them on fire as exhaust temperatures can easily exceed 1000 degrees. Fibreglass bags will handle the heat better, but are usually still lined with plastic/carpet. Either way, it'll ruin the paint.   Your best bet is to try to find some pipes that are longer and ride lower to give you some added clearance. I put some cobra slashdowns on my vn900 and gained about 4-5"" of space just because of the reduction of size from the factory pipes.   Tl;Dr if you point your exhaust right at your saddlebag you're gonna have a bad time."

Can't guarantee that they will be more affordable, but you can find something. They will be a metric thread, but Honda generally uses a single size, and probably does even now.   Some places to look would be J&P, Dennis Kirk, and if you know the exact thread EBay is an option.   Edit: not sure how, but I missed the part about the cheapies. There are the Kuryakyn which was a relatively popular brand with the V Star crowd for a while. Unfortunately they are far from cheap. If you want inexpensive it really is better to get the stock mirrors.   Something to consider is that the mirrors on your ACE were used for a while. You might come out lucky from a cycle salvage."
cruisers,3bnbk8,CmndrShrm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:43:55 2015 UTC,"your right about the china ones being crap, they vibrate and are useless, its because they are made with low density metals and have no mass to them to stop vibration. the stockers are heavy.  to be honest, almost all of the aftermarket ones are going to do that, except some of the smaller ones, but the smaller mirrors are almost useless on their own as well.  If you REALLY use your mirrors a lot, get stock replacements off ebay.  if you dont think they are that important (you prefer to head check rather than glance at a mirror) you can go for the smaller aftermarket ones, they won't vibrate so bad."

cruisers,3b0q03,porkrib,2,Thu Jun 25 01:08:06 2015 UTC,Just remove them entirely.  Replace the the tail light with one of those led ones that have the signals integrated.
cruisers,3b0q03,Dharq_Psyde,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:16:39 2015 UTC,Thought about that but I have to re run all the wires to the tail light area
cruisers,3b0q03,SocalMedigrow,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:02:40 2015 UTC,"Remove them completely and use hand signals, problem solved."
cruisers,3b0q03,Renigami,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:39:19 2015 UTC,"If it is anything like my Sabre, you don't have to completely rewire from the junction under the seat. There is terminal connects at my tail light housing and I can disconnect the set entirely and relocate them, and reconnect them at the rear.  You could cut the wires at that position and use disconnect terminals. A male spade and a corresponding female. And use ones that have a connector cover.  Though, I am assuming so much. If you do run a bit of longer wire between the initial position and the new position, make sure it doesn't drastically impact your current draw."
cruisers,3aw8b3,spyder641,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:22:08 2015 UTC,Beauty.
cruisers,3aw8b3,Xeronian,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:56:48 2015 UTC,Nice looking bike.
cruisers,3aw8b3,s0whatwh0cares,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:12:58 2015 UTC,The mean streak is the bike I saw on the Kawasaki floor 8 years ago and made me really want a bike.  Yours is a beauty.
cruisers,3aw8b3,Shitlord82,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:04:10 2015 UTC,"We have the same bike, and we decided to post pics around the same time.  Are you me?"
cruisers,3avh5r,DCDVath,3,Tue Jun 23 20:50:34 2015 UTC,Noice. Love my meanie ('08 special edition).
cruisers,3avh5r,derpoftheirish,2,Tue Jun 23 22:23:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! You'll have to post some pics up of yours sometime! I hear those SE's are some sexy looking Meanies.
cruisers,3avh5r,mathematical,3,Wed Jun 24 03:36:20 2015 UTC,Yeah! Mean Streaks are great bikes. The range is terrible but they're a lot of fun. I've had my '04 for a couple of years now and love it to death.
cruisers,3avh5r,Renigami,3,Tue Jun 23 23:19:09 2015 UTC,"I bought mine to be a bit more comfortable on longer trips. With mostly city driving I am getting to 120 before I have to fill up. I feel like I could probably make it 2 hours between fill ups on a longer trip, which is probably the longest I'd want to be going before taking a break anyway!  But yeah, compared to their competition I feel like I am jugging that 91 octane."
cruisers,3aq4rf,Luminosit,9,Mon Jun 22 16:28:52 2015 UTC,"Vulcan 900, Honda Shadow, Yamaha Bolt R-spec, Vulcan S, Iron 883.  You really really can't go wrong with any of them.  Choose which one fits you the best, rides well, and has the look you want.  Yamaha Bolt is nice.  I rode one a few weeks ago.  Well made, and probably arguable better than the 883."
cruisers,3aq4rf,MagmaManOne,2,Mon Jun 22 17:19:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for thesuggestions suggestions, I'm not too big on the looks of the bolt, but I'll look into the vulcan s, that looks like it has some potential for me haha"
cruisers,3aq4rf,MagmaManOne,3,Mon Jun 22 17:47:29 2015 UTC,"I rode the Vulcan S about 2 days ago, just trying it out.  That thing is stellar.  Unless you're a real big dude.  Handles amazing, good pickup for it's size as well.  And it just looks awesome."
cruisers,3aq4rf,MagmaManOne,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:59:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, and it's generally cheaper than the other ones.  lol"
cruisers,3aq4rf,MagmaManOne,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:01:04 2015 UTC,"I'm 6 1 200 haha so a little on the bigger side, I've rode the iron and it felt pretty comfortable haha"
cruisers,3aq4rf,FriskyNinja,2,Mon Jun 22 18:21:03 2015 UTC,"Nah, 6'1 200 is fine for the Vulcan S.  Plus, it has that ergo fit system that is great.  See now, I'm 6'4 and 270.  I was too big for it, lol.  But not by much, and to be honest, it still pulled me great."
cruisers,3aq4rf,Antal_Marius,2,Mon Jun 22 18:24:32 2015 UTC,"You like the iron 883 but not a Bolt? I bought my Bolt because it looks better, obviously in my opinion, and it's a lot cheaper. Love my Bolt."
cruisers,3aq4rf,CarsnHandlebars,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:24:05 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly looking at getting a Shadow Aero myself, as a spare to my other bikes."
cruisers,3aq4rf,Peanut_The_Great,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:00:02 2015 UTC,"There's also the Triumph Speedmaster. Big gas tank, good power, good handling, good looks imo."
cruisers,3aq4rf,Pacehouse,6,Tue Jun 23 14:42:21 2015 UTC,Only advice I can give is you can't go wrong with a Yamaha. Also saddlebags: you need them.
cruisers,3aq4rf,Peanut_The_Great,8,Mon Jun 22 17:15:40 2015 UTC,Vstar. Go vstar. You will not be disappointed.
cruisers,3aq4rf,TonzB,3,Mon Jun 22 18:37:25 2015 UTC,My 1300T agrees with you.
cruisers,3aq4rf,tdietz20,2,Mon Jun 22 18:38:59 2015 UTC,So does mine! Absolutely fantastic bike. I think coming from a sport bike OP will be disappointed with the power in the 883. Know a guy who did just that and told me he wishes he went for something with a bigger engine. I think bang for buck metric cruisers will yield a much better bike.
cruisers,3aq4rf,cantgrowneckbeardAMA,2,Tue Jun 23 12:16:47 2015 UTC,My '02 XVS1100A is going strong since bought new.  Only mechanical problem ever was the infamous starter clutch issue but replaced with heavier duty clutch and now it's bulletproof.  To add to the saddlebags issue:  LOCKING saddlebags are also key.  I have National Cycle's hard bags and they've been great but if I had to buy them again I'd probably get these bags from Viking as they're a better price.    Also I can do this
cruisers,3aq4rf,tdietz20,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"Tell me more about this starter clutch issue, I just started riding a vstar and have noticed it has a tendency to try to lurch forward if I start the bike in first, even with clutch fully engaged."
cruisers,3aq4rf,cantgrowneckbeardAMA,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:15:22 2015 UTC,"The issue actually has its own facebook page  It's a design flaw in the original starter clutch, or at least it's not heavy duty enough for the engine.  Some may never experience an issue but it's pretty common.   The symptom is generally a sharp kickback when starting, and eventually the clutch blows out entirely and the starter just spins without cranking.    There's an aftermarket heavier duty one with bigger clutch rollers like this one available at a reasonable price on eBay.  The install can be a bit tricky but there're are good walkthroughs and tips online and the Clymer manual does a decent job of detailing it.  Marking the position of the flywheel and keeping the crank from moving and reassembling so you don't screw up the timing is the tricky part (for some.  I screwed it up the first time)"
cruisers,3aq4rf,PrimeTime17,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:31:00 2015 UTC,Damn I had no idea it was that serious. Guys I'll be starting my bike in neutral from now on!
cruisers,3aq4rf,tdietz20,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:37:54 2015 UTC,"I actually just had my starter clutch go out on my 1100. I don't have the money to put it in my local shop, and was thinking about doing the repair myself. did you only replace the part in the text above or should I buy a whole kit like this ?"
cruisers,3aq4rf,PrimeTime17,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:41:52 2015 UTC,"well they say you should replace at least the one-way clutch and the starter gear together but I didn't.  I just did the one-way clutch and turned the gear a bit to smooth it out.  In retrospect I probably should have done it all at once to be sure, but it hasn't bit me yet.  The idler gear is another thing.  Supposedly there's a design flaw in that as well, and Yamaha has a replacement for the original.  Not sure if the kits online come with the updated one, probably best to confirm.  I used my old one.  The job isn't impossible, there's just a couple tricky parts.  The hardest part is removing the flywheel.  To hold it and break the nut I tried a bunch of ways, including a strap wrench, but ultimately I built a 2x4 contraption with some long bolts to clamp around the flywheel and one 2x4 was long enough to hit the ground and stop it from spinning as you break the flywheel nut.  Then you'll need a flywheel puller, which I borrowed from O'Reilly Auto parts (they called it a harmonic balancing gear puller but it was a basic puller, it was either 8mm or 10mm bolts I needed, make sure the rental kit has them or pick some up)  That's really it for special tools. Once the flywheel is loose make sure not to take it off until you line up the timing mark is lined up like it's supposed to be (through the inspection port on the left cover) because you HAVE to make sure the crank doesn't move and the flywheel goes back on the exact same way or you mess up the rear cylinder timing.  And make sure you're careful that the timing springs don't fall out of the back of the flywheel when you put it back on.  All of these tips make more sense when you've actually got this all apart.  If you're going to do this yourself I highly recommend following this guide, and invest in the Clymer manual.  It will pay off.  They would charge you over $1000 to do this in a shop."
cruisers,3aq4rf,tdietz20,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:57:38 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for all the advice and tips. I'm hoping to conquer it this weekend."
cruisers,3aq4rf,Renigami,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:46:55 2015 UTC,Just take a look at your starter gear.  If it's all notched and scored then you should probably replace it.  If it's smooth then it's fine.
cruisers,3aq4rf,VStarLord,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:50:00 2015 UTC,"Definitely would recommend a pair of saddlebags. Especially if you pair those with a set of the Easy Bracket mounting system like the one offered for the Shadow 1100s, but there are other makes available.  Removing the bags would return your cruiser to the sleeker look, and it is easy to remount them, with a key locking system."
cruisers,3aq4rf,Renigami,2,Tue Jun 23 03:12:57 2015 UTC,Get whatever looks the sexiest to you. You can get into the motorcycle world not regretting a thing...  ...until you want to upgrade :P
cruisers,3aq4rf,VStarLord,2,Mon Jun 22 22:07:24 2015 UTC,"After I took the MSF, on a Rebel, I was acclimating to the Shadow 1100s, with a Spirit that my dad used to have. Before the MSF, he would let me round the neighborhood on a Shadow VT500.  So, I really skipped the ""intermediate"" of upgrade, like the 750s or 600s of cruisers. I straight up tamed my now still used today, the Shadow Sabre VT1100C2, for the reason because I liked the Shadow line and it looked like a bike I would like and still like now. I don't plan on changing bikes in the future. I even took the advanced course with my current bike (a definite recommend).  (unless you happen to immediately jump to a Goldwing... or a Boss Hoss... that I can't help anyone with...)  So... ""unless you want to upgrade"" doesn't or may not apply. At least it did not for me anyways. :)"
cruisers,3aq4rf,Shitlord82,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:04:41 2015 UTC,"Looking back I could've just hopped on a 1100 - 1300 and would have been more than fine but for just starting out with no xp, I thought a 650 was big lol. So I guess it's a matter of perspective as well :P"
cruisers,3aq4rf,eastrod,2,Tue Jun 23 14:59:45 2015 UTC,"I recommend the v-star....but I'm biased.  On edit, coworker has the Stryker?   Awesome looking bike, good bit of factory rake too."
cruisers,3aq4rf,tonyled,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:56:55 2015 UTC,"If you are leaning towards the iron, I would suggest you test ride a cheaper dyna like the street bob. You'll pay more for the SB but I've heard of quite a few people over at /r/harley saying they started with a sporty - even the 1200's - and are looking to upgrade after one season.   I just made the jump from a 750 shadow to the street bob this season and I can't get enough of this bike. Having test rode a sportster '72, the small tank and frame makes it nice for just bombing around the city but anything over 70 mph and the thing was getting thrown all over the place. The '72 also has the peanut gas tank and only gets about 70 miles to a tank compared to 150 miles on a dyna tank. I didn't test ride any iron's but comparing the 1200 sporty's to the dyna, it is definitely worth the extra cash to go for the bigger bike imho."
cruisers,3aq4rf,TonzB,2,Mon Jun 22 18:45:03 2015 UTC,i agree with this whole heartedly.  i started on a smaller bike and wish i had not.
cruisers,3aq4rf,DCDVath,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:52:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed. There's nothing wrong with owning multiple bikes, but I knew I'd want to have mine for more than a season. Went with the 1300 after the class and I have no regrets. Granted I took it slow for the first month or so, to allow time to learn the bike, due to extra weight, etc."

cruisers,3anhum,mist91,3,Mon Jun 22 05:54:19 2015 UTC,A Harley at that price with that low of mileage is suspect. I'd definitely get a thorough inspection done.
cruisers,3anhum,The1Honkey,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:47:57 2015 UTC,"$2500 is a pretty fair price for that bike assuming it runs well and doesn't really need much else. I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't immaculate, but it should be good to go out of the gate."

cruisers,3afevf,deiam,2,Fri Jun 19 19:53:35 2015 UTC,It was a really tight fit in a single stall garage. lol. :p  But on a side note when you ride that bike it feels small and light with power to spare. Only took her on a 150 miler this last weekend. But it felt good. Been dinking around town to and from works mostly this week.

Your bike will run leaner with free-er flowing exhaust, how much leaner is dependant on your bike and pipes.   You don't want it to run any hotter than it has to during break-in."

cruisers,3a9fmp,rybob1,4,Thu Jun 18 07:34:22 2015 UTC,"customers like you are the best.  not because you dropped money on a silly fix  but because you were able to realize when a problem was above you, and take it to someone more experienced.  lots of people lack that, and will just keep breaking stuff until it sort of works.  sorry you had to spend so much, when people come into our shop with a simple problem like that I usually see if I can just get it going in a minute or so and its free. definitely not charge multiple hours of labor for lining up a few bolts."
cruisers,3a9fmp,hondabuilder,3,Thu Jun 18 15:43:35 2015 UTC,"Oh I've made that mistake already but I didn't pay anyone to fix it. Just take a seat on the passenger cushion and you should be able to put the bolts through. I'm dead serious. Just getting a bunch of weight on there will help you get it lined up, it's a bit tricky to figure out how much weight but still the frustration is worth $200 saved.   I have an M50 BTW."
cruisers,3a9fmp,CheezyPantz,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:18:17 2015 UTC,"Well thank you for sharing, I'll definitely keep that in mind!"
cruisers,3a97a3,s0whatwh0cares,3,Thu Jun 18 05:50:09 2015 UTC,Absolutely not. That bike is made for that and long cruises. At that speed your rpms are probably around 3k. The bike's rev limiter is just under 6k rpms. You could cruise at 120mph and be fine. I have a Road Star and the gearing is very similar. I have done many trips cruising at 80mph. You have nothing to worry about. Yamaha built that bike to be ridden.
cruisers,3a97a3,newsome51,3,Thu Jun 18 06:26:47 2015 UTC,"Nah those engines can take it.  I know two guys who do the same commute and have gone 100,000 miles.  They run the best full throttle."
cruisers,3a97a3,martymar,3,Thu Jun 18 06:37:53 2015 UTC,the 113 engine is basically bulletproof aside from a few production errors. 3rd gear and lifter issues. If it has them it will happen no matter what you do to it though.  My roadliner is at 66000 miles so far and aside from the lifter replacement warranty work all it has ever needed was a new belt because i broke mine :{
cruisers,3a97a3,onyxcrown,1 point,Thu Jun 18 14:36:31 2015 UTC,"Good to hear.  I asked my dealership where I got the bike and they were advising against it but I got the feeling it was more because of the ""you shouldn't be speeding"" angle instead of an actual limitation with this engine."
cruisers,3a97a3,onyxcrown,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:12:30 2015 UTC,"BTW, What ""3rd gear and lifter issues"" were you referencing?"
cruisers,3a97a3,Woodit,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:42:18 2015 UTC,Raiders may not have them. But roadliner do and it's the same powerplant. Basically weak metal used for 3rd gear and something bad for lifters. Was a production flaw and either one you need to fight for it to be fixed under warranty no matter how old your bike is because it should have been recalled
cruisers,3a9766,DominusDraco,5,Thu Jun 18 05:49:02 2015 UTC,I rode the vstar for a year.  Great bike once I changed the front sprocket to give it more top end speed.  Went from LA to Phoenix on that bad boy.  Couldn't wait to upgrade though.
cruisers,3a9766,martymar,2,Thu Jun 18 06:31:54 2015 UTC,I changed the front sprocket to give it more top end speed   Could you expand on that?
cruisers,3a9766,lumpking69,4,Thu Jun 18 11:18:17 2015 UTC,"Installing a larger front sprocket (or a smaller rear sprocket) is going to lower highway rpms. You're raising the gear ratios. It might be a little slower off the line, but it makes it more comfortable at higher speeds, and makes it feel like you aren't trying to kill your bike by going 75 mph."

cruisers,3a9766,lumpking69,5,Thu Jun 18 12:26:57 2015 UTC,Personally I'd relegate the chinese and non-Japanese options to a lower rung. Harder to go wrong with Honda/Kawasaki/Suzuki/Yamaha. And everything I've seen about those four makes any of them a decent choice.
cruisers,3a9766,cr0ft,2,Thu Jun 18 06:50:21 2015 UTC,"My wife and I both own Honda - your ""Shadow 250"" is probably a ""Rebel 250"" (what my wife rides) since the smallest Shadow made is the VT500c. (which is what I ride)   Really, it's hard to go wrong with the Honda. Just make sure it's been well treated - while I love my Shadow, it had been neglected by its former owner. It runs great, but it's annoying to be dealing with trivial stuff."

cruisers,3a9766,The1Honkey,2,Thu Jun 18 10:21:54 2015 UTC,Agreed. Get a little bigger than a 250. I started on a 650 and loved it. Great around town but could keep up with friends on trips.

Even if you're not, we've got the same system in Australia and I've been through the same sort of small-bike-shopping experience.  :)  I owned the Kawasaki Eliminator while on my learners.  I can vouch for it being a good little bike, nice and comfortable, and as decent amount of get-up-and-go as you could ask for a small bike.  My other suggestion from that list would be the Hunter Sypder.  They're a little roomier for taller guys, from what I remember after checking them out in person."

The pop is cold air being sucked in and expanding suddenly due to mixing with super heated exhaust gasses.

cruisers,3a86or,donefornow,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:37:07 2015 UTC,It's most definitely a fresh air leak leak. These bikes typically run very lean and so any extra fresh air will make them pop. Make sure you replace the exhaust gaskets correctly and tightened the headers back to the engine. Even a small gap will make the bike pop a bit. Good luck!

On my VTX, the temperature warning light comes on when I turn the key on, but shuts off when the engine is running.  If you have something similar, it would be fairly easy to wire up either a blinking light or piezo beeper directly to that circuit. That way, when you kill the engine but leave the key on, it'll remind you to shut it off.   Of course, it'd be best to just get yourself in the habit of turning it off.

No need for complicated high tech solutions when all bikers have been able to do so since, well, motorcycling and leaving the motorcycle at a parking spot.  You don't see motorcyclists with beepers the same way they have with cars and NFC ignitions... (parts that add to the cost of a bike for little gain and complexity)  Also, like running headlamps of a car (some models) the lights on my Sabre with the engine oil light will be on without the engine running but the key turned on. Shifting to neutral would also pop up that light as a reminder, but I say that turning off with the key and leaving the gear in 1st along with handle locking would be a better safeguard doing so.  Also when I return to my bike, I approach to unlock the handle bars from the lock side of my bike, thus enabling me to do a walk around before I leave. It is a good practice that I take. It also is a bit of a check before riding again from an area that I stopped at."

cruisers,39z9wl,theshrinesilver,5,Tue Jun 16 00:15:04 2015 UTC,"Absolutely follow the manual! The pressures on the sidewalk of the tires is the absolute max pressure the tire should be run at, but the figures in the manual will give you the best ride and control without stressing the tires at max pressure.   Checking your tires and air pressure EVERY day that you're going to ride is a good habit to get into. I don't always go over everything on the bike, but if I'm getting on the bike for the first time that day, I ALWAYS check the tire pressures and adjust accordingly."
cruisers,39z9wl,Tookiedoo,3,Tue Jun 16 00:54:20 2015 UTC,"Follow the manual if you have stock tires. The recommendations are for the tires that came equipped on the bike. If you have aftermarket tires, follow the tire manufacturers recommendations."

cruisers,39z9wl,dirty_hooker,4,Tue Jun 16 03:05:54 2015 UTC,"Seconding the statement above except to say that individual tire manufactures may say something different than what the manual says. Check the tire manufactures' website, they may have a different psi for your specific machine.  Never use max psi. Your tires are your first line of suspension, literally they are air springs. Riding at max psi will not only feel like shit but also cause the tires to bounce over small irregularities leaving you with less contact with the road, which is bad.  Also, swing by voulusiariders.com for a ton of info about your Suzuki from other Suzuki riders."

cruisers,39mcr8,ShutUpAndRide,3,Fri Jun 12 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"a lot of engineering went into finding the best bar shape for general use riding. everything you get to replace it will be a compromise of looks over comfort.  you should probably get the bars that speak to YOU and ride with them for awhile and see what you like or dislike about them.   bikes are very personalized vehicles and asking others what they think looks good will give you a million varieties and you'll have the same problem, you'll still have to pick some.  besides, bikes built by committees are boring, right?"
cruisers,39mcr8,hondabuilder,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:35:12 2015 UTC,"This. If I had to listen to the committee on the chopper style handlebars (and for that matter the stance of a sport bike), I would be having my arms with needles poking at them after awhile of riding and hating it (and my knees and legs pinched with the sport bike stance).  Stick with what is a good feel and comfort for you OP. Function over form. But both play off one another. It is a reason why I like my Shadow."

cruisers,3972dm,mist91,1 point,Tue Jun 9 19:55:50 2015 UTC,"If it's a squeak, probably not. I installed an aftermarket air filter on my bike and thought I broke something until I realized that the whistling noise was the intake. A blip on the throttle makes it go away for a couple seconds."
cruisers,3972dm,mist91,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:01:51 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a squeak though I do think it could possibly be related to the intake

cruisers,3972dm,mist91,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:13:31 2015 UTC,"Ok so I was a bit mistaken. Took it for a ride today and it really doesn't whine till in gear and throttle engaged. Mostly in low second. Could continue as well higher but even so it's eventually drowned out by cobra pipes and wind noise. Tried to get a better fix on where it's coming from and I might just be imagining it but it sounds like it's coming more from the back left when I get low and try to detect it. Sitting normal it sounds like it's from the front fork. May try to get my girl to sit on the back and record sound from different spots while moving at lower speeds tomorrow, though I feel like the wind might interfere too much with that."
cruisers,3972dm,im-buster,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:52:33 2015 UTC,If it's below you and behind you when sitting it can sound like it's coming from in front of you our ears can sometimes play weird tricks on us when things are behind us because of the way our ears shape and amplify sound. I would trust getting on your hands and knees and putting your ear close to things more than sitting on the bike.

cruisers,3947wa,ChipperJT,3,Tue Jun 9 03:33:35 2015 UTC,I asked this on /r/motorcycles and the concensus seemed to be go to school for it. It's a little expensive to go through and if you don't do even simple things right it can mean someone's life so you need proper training.
cruisers,3947wa,mist91,3,Tue Jun 9 15:50:04 2015 UTC,"As a vet, I would highly recommend you use your GI Bill to pursue a more traditional education. Hear me out if you will.  If you are mechanically inclined you will not lose those skills. But mechanics school will not teach you how to eventually run a business, or engineer something in the motorcycle field.   Mechanics eventually want to do more in their careers, but a traditional trade education can't get you there. Take my advice and spend your money and time wisely on a broader degree. Then, you can spend the time and money of you wish, and take out the $30k loan for mech school if you wish. Two degrees under your belt for 30k and you will be the clear decision for every promotion available at the dealership."
cruisers,3947wa,NoTimeForThat,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:37:27 2015 UTC,"This is some really good advice. As a whole, if you pick up a general 4-year business degree and stuff your electives full of mechanical courses, you'll be ahead. Way ahead. You'll able to face off with the accounting and paperwork, insurance and you'll understand overhead, liability and a whole range of things out of your reach just as a mechanic.  What's it better to be, the bench mechanic that gets laid off in winter months, or the shop managing mechanic that's on staff 12 months a year?"

Also, to qualify my statements I am a 63T and 63B, I never used my GI bill well and just kicked ass in my career on pure willpower . So, with no regular degree, at 45 years old and making $85k a year I don't have the degree that everyone looks for in a management position. It's my own fault, but there is no reason for you to be stuck but my own sillyness. Note: 85k a year at your age sounds like the most awesome, but you can do a lot more with your potential."
cruisers,3947wa,NoTimeForThat,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:54:45 2015 UTC,"I did get a taste of that same success without a degree. IT field specifically.   Then, economic downturn, and that well-paying job went away (along with about 200 others) to insulate a three-digit multi-billion dollar company from potentially losing out on our little salaries, and the board all patted themselves on the back with a couple million a piece. Replacing it was not an option for me, now I was competing in a sea of degrees and experience, but now I didn't fit the bill of that young, unencumbered maverick anymore. Now I was just that older guy asking for enough to keep his family off the streets, but guess what, that new young maverick will do the job for half that. He's got student loans to pay and he's just as desperate.   So, don't let a single successful anecdote sway you, because this is what we call a statistical outlier. Sure, Jobs dropped out of college, but so did millions and millions of other people, but you don't hear them all founding Apple. Arm yourself for the future fights for your job, level your playing field."

My out the door price for this was $3800, which I'm very happy with.  I was surprised by how light the bike felt.  It's 180 lbs heavier than the 250cc bike I learned on but it felt like much, much less than that.  It might have felt 10% heavier than the Suzuki GZ250 I rode the MSF on.  I was also surprised at how smooth and controllable the bike was.  If you can ride a 250cc, then you can ride this.  Couldn't be happier!"
cruisers,38x37q,hondabuilder,3,Sun Jun 7 16:09:33 2015 UTC,"compared to the vast majority of motorcycles in the cruiser world, the honda shadow is VERY light.  I've been around, been riding for 10 years now, use my bike as a daily vehicle. I got into touring bikes and rode goldwings on crazy long road trips. After owning a LOT (a seriously lot) of bikes over the years, I finally settled on my ""final"" bike.  the bike that best fit all my needs.  it ended up being a shadow 750 Aero, like yours (the only differences are fenders and bars)  http://i.imgur.com/burdZxj.jpg  I customized it.  a LOT...  but youll like it, the motor is basically the same VT500 engine from the 80s, so its been refined over 30 years to have almost zero problems. the chassis and shaft drive are way stronger than needed, so much so that I can turn mine into a full touring bike carrying more weight than intended and its fine. Brakes are good, even loaded down. stock its kind of lacking in the power department, i have a LOT of mods on mine and it outruns harleys (truth be told anything can outrun a harley) but mid 12 quarter miles aren't bad.  my point is this, dont think of it as a ""starter"" bike. because after riding thousands and thousands of miles on the bigger bikes you might call an ""upgrade"", I think the Honda shadow is truly one of the best motorcycles available and with some modifications it can whoop ass.  some things you need to watch for, the stock clutch springs are weak, and for a new rider learning to ride, you are more likely to wear out the clutch. WHEN that happens, get the clutch pack from EBC, and the springs from Barnetts, available at any dealer, total cost will be like 75 bucks plus labor to install.  best first mod you can do.  if you want more power, there is a lot you can do. the fuel injected models have LESS options for making real power, so be glad you didn't get one of those. and remember this in-case you get sucked into parts counter guy sales speeches.  Bolt on parts like air filters and exhaust DO NOT ADD HORSEPOWER. they help the motor breathe better but any speed gain you feel will be mostly psychological due to spending money and wanting to see a tangible benefit. making these motors build real horsepower involves some head work and ignition work. NOT bolting on some mufflers.  edit: clicked your username, fuck yes on timesplitters: future perfect! hahaha, random."

cruisers,38nnah,vandutton,5,Fri Jun 5 11:34:25 2015 UTC,"Its mostly for maximizing braking potential and settling the bike before and during turn in to a corner. Its a performance thing, not really sure why you'd need to do it on a cruiser.   Basically you transition from 100% (or close to it) breaking force to a lower percentage during the turn in, maybe at the beginning of the turn you might have gone down to 10-20% of breaking force and as the turning angle deepens, your slowly back off even further till theres no brake on at all. Ive never done it on my cruiser and rarely did it on my street bikes. Its a track thing, IMHO. The danger is that you can ask too much of your front tire, during braking and turning, so you can low side. I guess it could be helpful if you overcook a corner, but even then, its a low percentage of total braking force."
cruisers,38nnah,TheTallGuy0,2,Fri Jun 5 12:25:13 2015 UTC,Just wasn't familiar with the application of it. Didn't know if it was even worth learning on the cruiser

cruisers,38nnah,TonzB,6,Fri Jun 5 16:13:51 2015 UTC,"Looking back on it, I've done this at times without realizing, when I'm coming in a little hot into a turn.   Sportbikes may benefit more from this particular skill, but I don't see why any good riding technique should be disregarded.  Anything that will make you more adaptable and increase your safety and grow your skills should be at least considered."

cruisers,38ize6,cr0ft,3,Thu Jun 4 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"You're probably going to have to DIY.   Choppers have historically often done basically a bar across the frame up front and folding pegs on said bar. That's really where the name ""highway bar"" come from, I suppose, what we usually have on our bikes these days would probably be better described as crash bars or engine bars.   http://www.cruisercustomizing.com/mc-enterprises-hiway-bar-w-alligator-pegs-foot-rests-v-star-650/part/MC-4388 - something along those lines?  http://www.mcenterprisesusa.com may have something."

Met 2 of them, each at different times who told me that when I was in the market for a bike and mentioned looking at a 650 and 1100.  I thought it sounded unlikely, because a frame that could fit engine as well as one nearly twice the displacement seemed unlikely, but hey... They were the mechanics.

cruisers,38efpa,Wells1632,2,Wed Jun 3 17:55:22 2015 UTC,"Normal batteries are far less.   Though I'd recommend springing for an AGM (absorbent glass mat) battery variant, better tech than truly old-school lead/acid.  (Or the deluxe version which is lithium iron, but those shoot past $100 quite quickly if you need a large one.)"
cruisers,38efpa,cr0ft,1 point,Wed Jun 3 21:00:32 2015 UTC,"Far less? Just doing a quick search for batteries for your RIII there, I see a range of $80 to $120. The same goes for my Trophy, and it is going to be the same for my old CB750A."
cruisers,38efpa,Wells1632,2,Fri Jun 5 19:55:43 2015 UTC,"I personally use the ""Parts Unlimited"" brand batteries. they are built to the right spec and I have never had one fail in any of my bikes, I do ride every single day and I use my bike the way most people use their car so I have never had to put it on a charger either, just go out to the bike and ride. every day.  I am a dealer for PU and I get parts at cost, but even if I had to buy them, after talking to the rep and seeing the quality of the PU batteries vs the others vs the prices. I'd still go with Parts Unlimited, that is, if I'm ordering through a dealer and not online.   if you are the kind of person to let it sit for weeks at a time, you'll want to spring for a very high quality battery that can take that kind of abuse. You want nothing less than a Yuasa AGM like this  http://www.amazon.com/Yuasa-YUAM3RH2S-YTX12-BS-Battery/dp/B000WK4CS4  thats a pretty good price, too.  The benefit of ordering via a Parts Unlimited dealer is if they don't have it in stock for you to walk out with, it comes to the shop next day for you to pick up.  and you don't pay the shipping cost like you would if buying online via another site.  Only advice I got is don't get a Lithium. the technology is not right for automotive use, they need more maintenance, special chargers, cost a LOT and if something goes wrong its dead. I worked at a shop where we installed 2-5 of those a week and I saw the failure rate first hand.   Some people are totally fine, but overall, lithium batteries in bikes only make sense under very specific circumstances. for general use, stick with what the manufacturer intended, Lead Acid or AGM."

It did cost quite a lot of money, though, it's entirely possible I'll go to AGM when it goes, but I still expect several years out of this one."

cruisers,38efpa,hondabuilder,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:41:30 2015 UTC,"Well, by the time the temporary insanity of ""must... have... the... best..."" had passed I had a battery on my bike that cost over $300 (the Rocket III needs a nuclear reactor to spin the engine on startup), and at that point it just seemed dumb to not add on $80 and get a charger to maintain it.   But in retrospect, it's too much money - yes, the battery has worked perfectly, and I saved some weight on an already heavy bike, but it's probably not worth $400 vs a $100-150 high quality AGM. Even with 540 CCA vs the 320 or so you get out of AGM in this class."

cruisers,38efpa,hondabuilder,2,Thu Jun 4 09:02:31 2015 UTC,"when you get the battery, fill it with acid, let it settle, use a flashlight and tap it with the plastic end of a screwdriver to get all the bubbles out, then charge it overnight with a battery tender.  Harbor Freight sells a 12v float charger for 9.99 that is actually quite good. I've been using mine for two years now, it doesn't overcharge and its as good as any Battery Tender I've had as well. If you don't have a charger, scoop one of those up. worth it, works on car batteries too, good to let your car battery charge overnight on it once a month or so as well. thats what I do, my truck sits most of the time un-used."

I was shopping for something in the 800 to 1000 cc range and hadn't ever heard of Victory when a family friend made an offer I couldn't refuse...and here I am with a 1500cc beast.

I am pretty sure they are sort of made by the same company.    I am so afraid to test drive one, I have to build my garage first.  I can't fit 2 bikes in the shed.

Does 2-up - with a giant trailer if need be - effortlessly. And looks pretty good, especially with some Avon Cobra whitewalls on her.  There's no other motorcycle engine quite like it anywhere, 204 nm of torque is staggering every ride you go on.  Don't get that iconic v-twin thumping though. But easily the best bike I've ever owned, or ridden for that matter."

Beautiful machine.   I am not sure about the triumph quality though.   No questions about Japanese bikes or with Victory.   I know some folks that have other triumph machines and they like them but their complaints is that the bike in general is littered with some suspect parts.  Nothing major so far, but things like the clutch adjustment plate and parts that you don't want to have fail when you are out riding are made of cheap tin and strip or break rather easily.   For $15-20 each part that they have found online.  You would expect that the manufacturer would splurge for those parts.   I wouldn't expect any less on that heavy duty cruiser.  Especially at that price point.  It is a really good looking bike though with plenty of chrome for my taste as well."
cruisers,387oej,FrankDrebin72,2,Wed Jun 3 13:57:50 2015 UTC,"I hang out on most Triumph and Rocket specific boards and there are some issues on occasion, but certainly nothing that approaches an epidemic. The issues with the engine and tranny early on were ironed out, the black engines are internally upgraded after that.   Mine is also red and black, and I agree, looks great. Best color combo IMHO.   But sure, there are some bargain basement touches to the bikes, for instance the hand controls are kind of cheesy out of the box etc, but overall I'm very happy with the quality of mine, so I disagree with the idea that Triumphs are lesser. Sure, I'm biased, but over several years I have yet to have an issue.   The only thing you really ""have to"" do to them is fix the atrocious ECU map they put in the Touring; they dialed it back to 106 horses and apparently they did that by making the bike refuse to rev much past 4k. A revised variant was put out for it by ""Power-tripp"" and with that it revs cleanly to 6k and hits 140 horses at about 5500.   Anyway, some bargain basement parts and a very wide stance on the bike to fit around the engine are forgotten the instant you take it out on the road and turn the fun handle..."
cruisers,387oej,FrankDrebin72,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:27:51 2015 UTC,"I never meant to say that I thought they were lesser, I like the look of it, just don't know enough people with them to know if they are a decent ride.

cruisers,387b2q,theshrinesilver,4,Tue Jun 2 10:53:45 2015 UTC,"Well, one option is to get an Airhawk cushion. They're not cheap, but they genuinely work. It's an air cushion with a construction that allows air to slowly seep from one part to the other, and it works by creating a thin layer of air between you and the seat. It spreads the load evenly and eliminates hot spots under your tailbone for instance. They extend the time to agony quite a lot. http://www.airhawk.net  Some people swear by Corbin seats. They're famously hard and have a wear-in period, but that can work - a hard seat won't let your cheeks sink in so far that there is undue pressure on the tailbone. http://corbin.com/suzuki/volmenu.shtml  But there are a number of manufacturers to look into, here are a few. The Day-long people take your existing seat and rebuild it to fit you specifically.  http://www.day-long.com/  http://www.sargentcycle.com/  http://www.rickmayercycle.com/  http://billmayer-saddles.com/  http://www.mustangseats.com/"

Hard to say which manufacturer will specifically suit you, it differs a lot from person to person. Perfect for one guy can be a disaster for the next, that sort of thing.   I have the Airhawk and it works. If the seat is really sucky it will certainly double the time before it gets painful, but it can take a so-so seat and make it quite comfy - again, your mileage may vary as the saying goes. But it's certainly not snakeoil."

The stock seat on my bike was terrible but that was a different kind of pain.  That was screwed in the ass by a cactus on hi-gear kind of pain.  I have a new seat and that issue hasn't returned.
cruisers,3842ql,TonzB,2,Thu Jun 4 03:44:38 2015 UTC,"Hard on your back compared to what? Sport bikes? no contest, imo. I've ridden sport bikes, and frequently ride with friends who ride them as well. Any ride over 30 minutes and I see my buddies stretching their legs... a lot, shifting position on the bike frequently and appearing generally uncomfortable.   Ideally you'll sit on several different bikes to see what feels good.... each has a slightly different position, but that will only go so far in terms of long-term riding comfort. Cruisers do have several options for improving comfort above stock...    floorboards instead of pegs forward controls highway pegs upgraded suspension: some manufacturers make progressive springs for several bike models which supposedly improves ride quality. I haven't used progressive rears, so I can't say first hand. upgraded seats: many options including some with backrests. I don't have back problems, but my bike came with a mustang seat with backrest. Took off the backrest for a couple weeks because I thought it looked too ""old-timer-y"" I started noticing my posture was suffering and my lower back was starting to hurt. Put it back on and I can ride all day with no discomfort anywhere except my right wrist (damn you carpal tunnel!) I've done up to 275 miles in one day on this bike.   Both the V Stars and Shadows are great bikes. Again, when you're ready to buy, go sit on a bunch of them and see what fits you then you can look for one with some or all of the upgrades you want. Can't speak to other styles of bikes, because I haven't ridden them.  Ultimately I can't tell you that you won't have back pain riding, but the most comfortable bikes I've ridden have all been cruisers."

And I've always wondered how comfy floor boards would be on a bike. I've seen at least 4 or 5 Vstar 1100's for sale on a local facebook page and they all have floorboards.

Expensive, but I figured I am making my bike my own rather than flipping it later on for another. I don't have to worry about the aluminum water spots and aluminum corrosion over time and they are simple to wipe down and clean while keeping with the Sabre styling, the reason why I picked my bike to begin with after riding the Shadow Spirit of my dad's in the past.  Also, the removal of my big windshield of the previous owner and the leather tank pocket, giving the bike a sleeker look. I am liking my Sabre's handling after the removal, as the windshield makes the front end for me seem heavier. And while some people call it sacrilege to replace the stock 2000 Shadow Sabre decal and color scheme, I had the fenders, tool and battery cover, and tank repainted to a brighter red than the dark maroon of before.  And I also added the Easy Bracket for my Sabre, giving it capabilities of the cargo of saddle side bags (any bag of my choosing, hard or soft as long as I can use the brackets), but ease of removal keeping the Sabre sleek when I want to with it's pegs, in place of the rear fender bolts.   I also added a tachometer. It helps gauge my shifting and idle at times.  Lastly, I replaced the aftermarket straight through pipes of the previous owner and re-jetted back to the stock Shadow Sabre pipes. The previous ones were TOO LOUD for my liking as I rode with her over time. Enough for me and my neighborhood surroundings to appreciate that I went back to the default stock pipes."

cruisers,381wkp,Alitalia,2,Mon Jun 1 06:48:23 2015 UTC,"I have the OEM large windshield for my Yamaha V-Star 1000 from when I bought it new in 2002.  I haven't used it in years though largely because I haven't really needed it for longer trips and I never really liked how loud it was when mounted.  I wonder if I've been using it wrong.  On a friend's recommendation I always mounted it on the higher of the two mounting positions and with it sloped back to the extent possible.  I figured this would keep the low pressure ""whipping around"" effect higher and further back, but maybe I'm mistaken?  Is there a tradeoff to maybe to take a little more wind in favor of a quieter experience (given that I can generally get by without it anyway)?"
cruisers,381wkp,tdietz20,1 point,Mon Jun 1 09:26:49 2015 UTC,"You want to force the air up and over your helmet to the greatest extent possible. It should be high, but ideally more straight, and for even greater ""bubbling"" a recurve on the top portion of it doesn't hurt. Air coming off a shield will be coming in vortex form, which can punch your helmet around and cause a lot of noise and rider fatigue.   Some people even install a Laminar Lip to push the wind/bubble even higher.  In my experience, there are two kinds of shields that work - one that is super high and extra wide, to really generate a big bubble zone behind it. It might even help to have a vent to cut down on the ""vacuum"" forming behind the shield itself which can make the bubble smaller.  Then there's the opposite, a short and more narrow shield that leaves your helmet out in mostly ""clean"" air, but has the wind stream hitting your chest area which offloads your body and arms a lot while letting you get superb helmet ventilation and no air vortexes punching you in the head."

I'm new to riding motorcycles (owned a 300cc maxi-scooter until 3 weeks ago when I got the C50T), but I feel like it is too tall.  I mostly look through the windshield rather than over it, and I suspect I shouldn't be doing that.  If I was going to replace it, I'm not sure what brand/model I'd get, but I'd definitely want to get something that could be easily removed (quick-release or something similar)."

cruisers,381wkp,Mytos,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:18:29 2015 UTC,"Looking through it can be a valid choice. How does your helmet behave, is the air back there smooth or do you get ""punched in the head"" by the wind a lot? Getting a smaller shield can make the ride suck, if it directs the wind so that you get a lot of vortexes of air punching you in the helmet it can be worse than riding naked."

For those of us who aren't 6'6"" who get a taller shield, it's pretty smooth and above all far less fatiguing with a shield.  For shorter runs, riding without a shield is excellent, but I wouldn't try touring that way."
cruisers,381wkp,cr0ft,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:59:00 2015 UTC,I do it on my trips.  I do 5 weeks of touring a year doing 5000+ miles each week.  Last year was the first one I bought a windshield for thinking it would work but mailed it back home after the first day once we got to Amarillo from Houston.  A lot of the guys in our group hate windshields and the others swear by them.  Just up to preference I guess.
cruisers,381wkp,VTX1800,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:12:09 2015 UTC,"Preference, and also if the shield is right, I would assume. For instance, on my bike the stock shield is not high or wide enough for what it's supposed to be doing, which means with that I get the air hitting my helmet and my head literally bounces left/right; this gets worse with a helmet that's too large btw, which something like 80% of riders have.   Which is why I hit up Clearview and got a shield that is 4 inches wider and three inches taller, with the recurve on top to push the bubble even higher. And with those modifications, my helmet is very nearly entirely out of the ""vortex zone"" and in still air.   The only drawback with this is that in very hot weather some more cooling would be welcome. Which is why I'm trying to find the quick-release hardware that goes on the screen so I can put it on the stock shield I still have, and then cut that shield down by 3-4 inches."
cruisers,381wkp,cr0ft,1 point,Tue Jun 2 05:18:06 2015 UTC,True.  I bought the biggest one I could find that didn't look stupid on my bike which came up to the height of my nose.  Still didn't work.  I just gave up with it even after adjusting up and down on the forks.

Windshield is great for long trips or rides at night because bugs.  Also helps keep a lot of the wind off my chest, which has pros and cons.  I've considered a batwing, and I've considered leaving it off. I don't think it contributes anything to the bike aesthetically, but it serves a purpose so I've left it on thus far.

Seemed not very well thought out, power delivery is nothing to talk about.   Sportsters.  GOOD bikes. hard to kill, will run forever. had classic ""harley"" problems. shifter shaft seals will leak alot, head gaskets can leak on older EVOs, will pretty much always run. simple motors but need some special harley tools to do some jobs. loads of torque.  Hondas.  I'm biased.. I'm a honda tech and I think they are some of the best engineered bikes available. I sold my ultra classic, goldwing 1500, and other bikes specifically to build a mid-size touring bike out of a Shadow 750 platform.    I use the 750 because I wanted amazing MPG on the super long trips I take, also I tuned the shit out of the motor and it outruns any harley stoplight to stoplight.  in YOUR case, you would probably be happier with the VTX1300. It just pulls, even with passengers, and the 6th gear is nice. The only reason I didn't use it for my daily driver build was because it's out of production now. the 750 shadow from 2004 is the exact same 2015 bike on showrooms today, almost every part swaps over. the difference on the latest ones is the disc is on the right instead of left, the rear drum is now a disc, and it has EFI instead of carb.   Carb is far easier to tune for intake/exhaust, and you won't ever notice it really. Hondas are dead reliable.  I'd go for sportster or Honda, avoid the V-stars. You'd be happy with both. sportsters are SMALL FRAMED BIKES and if you're tall, you have to use high bars and pegs to fit comfortably, but then you just look stupid straddling a tiny bike.  the VTXs are pretty damn big bikes, but lightweight and VERY easy to maneuver. extremely well thought out."
cruisers,37kyqt,hondabuilder,2,Fri May 29 06:09:51 2015 UTC,1300 VTX's have 5 gears not 6.  Personally I wouldn't call the VTX lightweight.  Actually it's about 50 lbs heavier than a 1300 VStar.  I'd guess it's probably one of the heaviest 1100-1300cc bikes (almost a 100 pounds heavier than a 1200 sportster).  Pretty sure the Yamaha has more hp and torque also.

I had to weld a fully custom bracket system from 1/2 inch steel tube to hold these onto the bike. you can NOT buy a setup that will make your shadow look like this.  the only way for me to get the bags to sit that low was to completely ditch the stock exhaust, I build this new true dual setup out of pre-bent tubing sections and harley Sportster mufflers. I had screaming Eagle performance mufflers on but I wanted it quieter so I put stock sportster pipes on the ends of my custom headers.  I routed the rear cylinder under the swingarm to the other side of the bike and both mufflers bolt to the saddlebag mount.  the front lower fairings are also harley pieces, off the FL touring bikes. they are mounted to the stock harley crash bar, but the bar has been modified by widening it by 3 inches so it clears both sides of the honda frame perfectly.    other than that, its a lot carb tuning, new clutch and springs, ignition advance, better suspension and brakes all around.  for you to modify your bike similar to mine you will need 900-1400 for the cost of fairings/bags alone. then because you cannot mount the bags to the stock bike with the stock exhaust, you will need to pay a fabricator to build custom headers and custom bag mounts.  youll be upside down on the bike because that stuff can get in the thousands range very quickly.  I do, however, TOTALLY recommend the Memphis Shades batwing. its AWESOME, its REALLY good at deflecting the wind around your head, as long as the shield you buy is a tall one. and takes pressure off your chest.  I ride with an open face helmet and I have NO wind in my face or eyes even up to 110mph.  and its very simple to install you can do it at home with a few basic tools.  the only problem is that its hollow inside, memphis does not make any custom inner fairing to house a radio or speakers, thats why its so cheap.  I'm in the middle of building a custom inner fairing and having it upholstered along with my seat, its going to house custom guages, a tach, a radio, and speakers."

I don't think I'd trade the 1800 VTX F I have now for anything.  With all that said my brother has a Yamaha 1300 V-star and I think I'd take that over the 1300 VTX I had.. The Yamaha in that class has fuel injection and dual front disc brakes and it just seemed (again in my opinion) an all around quicker, smoother bike.  I'm not saying anything bad about the 1300 VTX, I believe that to be an absolutely solid bike and a great choice.  I just personally like that 1300 VSTAR.  Maybe I'm just a fuel injection kind of guy.."
cruisers,37kyqt,TonzB,2,Fri May 29 03:20:15 2015 UTC,"What you're after is completely reasonable. Piece of advice. I rode a 2002 VStar 1100 for just over 18 months, for around town 2 up was fine. Acceleration is slowed because of added weight, but it wasn't unbearable. However, on the interstate, 2 up that thing was awful. Granted I only had 5 gears but I had to work the motor hard to maintain speeds. I would keep your eyes on 1300 and up, and a 6 speed if you can get one. You will not go wrong with any of the big metric cruisers. Go with fuel injection, they are a little more costly to repair and maintain, but will be a helluva lot more reliable and easier to own than carbs...my 1100 was carb'd."

cruisers,37kyqt,TonzB,3,Thu May 28 18:59:25 2015 UTC,"See if you can get the VStar 1300, they changed some of the issues with the 1100 and it's a great bike. For instance, changing the oil on a VS 1100 was a pain in the ass because you have to drop the front exhaust pipe to get to the filter...unless you spend 250 on the filter relocation kit."

Patriot usually has about 4,000 bikes riding out of their location, so the earlier you get there, the closer to the front you get, and the earlier you get to the pentagon and get to start the parade earlier. I rode out of Whitt's Harley in Manassas this year and left the pentagon to ride the parade route around 1:30, wasn't bad at all. Just a thought. Watching the parade is pretty cool, too, especially if you can a spot right near independence and constituion."

There is a good chance the pads are low / toast and need replaced. Do not simply push the piston back up the line as that's a great way to dump brake fluid on your paint. Open the bleeder and catch the fluid. Fluid is cheap and good to replace every once in a while.
cruisers,36frjf,dirty_hooker,1 point,Tue May 19 04:21:37 2015 UTC,"If I've only put 1,500 miles on the bike, is it likely the brakes are already worn out? The pads looked almost new when I pulled it off and checked...."

We put the large pack behind the sissy bar and then filled the panniers. We tend to travel light, but we weren't uncomfortable by any stretch.

My fiance and I both got Galaxy S5s when they came out but when the S6 Edge came out she got it and being an electronic hoarder I insisted we keep it ""just in case."" I also keep the old phone (with a fully charged battery) on my person at all times so all I had to do was walk back q half mile and find the corpse to salvage the sim and SD cards so I was back onto an identical phone within minutes!

I ended up getting this one  I have a Nokia Icon and it works great for me.  The case keeps the fingers from hitting any buttons and it's super secure.  The kit comes with a couple different sets of fingers and you can adjust stuff to fit a lot of different models.  Check the dimensions to see if it fits.  I used this mount on a 2 week 4000+ road trip last summer and it was really handy for taking quick photos and GPS functions.    RAM mounts are really damn solid, they are built for professional use.  I guess if I had any complaints, is that it's not real cosmetically appealing.  It's built for utility not for looks."

cruisers,35jnok,procrastibatwhore,2,Mon May 11 00:54:16 2015 UTC,Check to see if your bike has an air induction system or a reed valve and if it does google the delete kit fir it.  These systems put additional air in the exhaust to help burn off unspent fuel and are notorious for causing that popping sound on deceleration.
cruisers,35jnok,anonymous_reddituser,1 point,Mon May 11 01:21:51 2015 UTC,No fancy induction. 94 Honda shadow 1100. But a lot of people have told me its lean or rich. I tried the air fuel adjustment screws a full turn in and out and it still does it.  Doesn't seem to have a loss of power or act up. A few people have told me that having those pipes causes a super lean condition and will actually fry the Pistons and valves. Not sure how true that is but I'm starting to worry
cruisers,35jnok,anonymous_reddituser,1 point,Mon May 11 01:30:44 2015 UTC,Running a motor lean enough to fry the pistons takes a fair amount of trying. Pipes could be exacerbating the problem but it's definitely not going to cause a catastrophic failure. Is there excessive bluing on the pipes especially by the first bend? Try varying the octane levels in your fuel (regular vs. premium) to see if you can alleviate the noise. You could also look into changing the air intake to something more restrictive to richen your fuel mixture.
cruisers,35jnok,NastyCabbage,1 point,Mon May 11 02:19:56 2015 UTC,"The pipes can cause the engine to breath easier, pulling more air through than the carbs are tuned for. You can pull the sparkplug and look for evidence of a lean mixture - easy job. At least then you know its lean.  Other potential causes for your symptoms are a bad seal somewhere between the carb and the engine, letting in additional air.  Edit: If you have the original toolkit per chance, there is a tool that makes removing the sparkplugs really easy."
cruisers,35jnok,jayelwin,1 point,Mon May 11 20:59:03 2015 UTC,Well I can get one side of spark plugs out but not the other.  It's a 94 honda shadow 1100 and I need a special tool or really thin walled socket to get the other plug out. It's has two per cylinder. Is the special tool your talking about for getting the spark plug out?
cruisers,35jnok,cstanford94,1 point,Tue May 12 00:48:37 2015 UTC,Loud pipes sometimes just reveal popping more because they're loud pipes. Putting the quieter stock pipes on helps even if you still get the popping. Even well tuned bikes pop on decel especially if you really snap the throttle closed.

cruisers,358lrl,porkrib,5,Fri May 8 00:37:56 2015 UTC,"you want to look at the service duty logos on the back.  its a round circle with different ratings around the edges, its on ALL oils.  it doesn't matter if its automotive or motorcycle, what you want to avoid is any oil that has ""energy conserving"" on the logo on the back. that has the friction modifiers /u/drumstyx mentioned, which are bad for your clutch.  beyond that, its really about composition. not brand.  you don't want paraffin or certain additives in your motorcycle.  so technically, no, there isn't REALLY a difference except that the motorcycle ones are LESS LIKELY to have bad additives or paraffin in the oil, and car oils are more likely to have those, since they help when the engine oil is just inside the block, and not being run through the tranny or clutch as well.  buy the oil that has the composition thats correct for your bike. do NOT become a brainless brand loyalist like sooo many are."
cruisers,358lrl,hondabuilder,3,Fri May 8 00:58:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. Motorcycle oil lacks friction modifiers because the clutch usually runs in the oil. However, being that this is /r/cruisers, if you're running a Harley or other bike with a separate transmission and clutch system from the engine, then in theory, you can use regular motor oil. I don't know the implications of that though, since I've only ever owned bikes with clutches running in the engine oil."
cruisers,358lrl,drumstyx,4,Fri May 8 00:50:59 2015 UTC,"I can speak for Harley's. The motor is really no different from your typical OHV Chevy or Ford (actually has some parts in common). Like you said, regular motor oil is no problem since it never touches the clutch."
cruisers,358lrl,JDSportster,2,Fri May 8 01:35:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of times the oil is the same. You just want to make sure that the oil you use meets the requirements of your engine.

cruisers,34thef,TeacupDragoness,3,Mon May 4 12:49:59 2015 UTC,"It can be harmful to the bike.  An empty fuel system is vulnerable to condensation which leads to rust, and corrosion.  Drying out your carburetors means gunk formation.  Ideally you would fill it with gas add stabilizer and run it so the stabilizer gets distributed through the fuel system.    If they won't take your bike if it isn't empty I don't see you having much choice, empty it and give it a good cleaning on the other side.  If you have the time you might try treating the inside of your tank to prevent rust, /r/motorcycles had a post about tank rust cleaning and prevention not too long ago."
cruisers,34thef,stonefarfalle,2,Mon May 4 14:59:07 2015 UTC,"im familiar with shipping carb'd bikes overseas.  the problem when you completely drain it is the fuel tank is RAW steel inside, and salt air WILL corrode it very very quickly, and it can take awhile to get to where its going. that can lead to a completely rusted out tank, and corrosion of the floats and other small parts inside the carb itself.  what you could do is empty the tank, remove the carb and completely drain it, then spray it with carb cleaner to remove all gasoline traces. then seal every opening on the carb to limit airflow through it.  as for the tank, I have fogged them with WD-40 and had them show up on the other side just fine.  oil would work too, pour a small amount in, roll the tank around so its coating all the sides.  it is quite a pain to flush the tank again after getting it back, but its more of a pain to have a rusted out gas tank and unusable carb...  heres my Aero, btw. love these bikes!  http://i.imgur.com/ZbDto4b.jpg"

I guess we are a little bit more fortunate with our shipping because it is being shipped with household goods and in wooden crates with its cover on. That won't mitigate all of the salt air, but it will help reduce it even if a little bit. I will take your advice on prepping the tank after we drain it completely. When we shipped it to the overseas location we were allowed to leave 1/4 of a tank of fuel in the bike so we didn't have all of these worries. Now we regret bringing it over since we never even got to ride it while here.   By the way this is our second Aero. We sold the first one during a whirlwind move across country that we had several years ago.

Don't be afraid to push your abilities but when you feel uneasy with the speeds around corners slow down and know your limits.

cruisers,346on7,MinecraftHardon,5,Tue Apr 28 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"Fuck yeah you can get a decent bike for that much! On a cruiser, you want to feel for that pull at a high gear. Nothing compares to having the rpms low and giving it throttle and the torque pulls you back.   You should be able to find something decent in the 700-1100cc range with that budget. Pretty much any modern(00-10) cruiser with fuel injection will be a good bet. Carbed isn't so much unreliable, but maintenance on fuel injection is next to nothing.   If you have a friend that knows bikes, have them come. I can't stress this enough tho, be present for a cold start up. That'll give you the best indication of how the bike was maintained, if it doesn't want to start up without a little provocation I'd stay away. Feel the engine(gloved) to see if it's already been started and warmed up."
cruisers,346on7,Taelryn,1 point,Tue Apr 28 19:52:37 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I bought a 2007 Shadow Spirit last year for around that price.  I read a lot of online articles on buying a bike and what to check for. As others have mentioned you want to see the bike started when the engine is cold. If a bike has already been started and warmed up it's much easier to turn over. If someone selling it has it warmed up it could indicate that it has difficulty starting.  Check to see that all the electrical systems work. Starter, blinkers, lights, horn, etc. The clutch should not be loose. The throttle should not stick and should quickly snap back to being off.  Make sure the tires are good and do not have dry rot. Most tires have an estimated life from the manufacturing date, and may not be good after even if it's low miles.  I test rode a few bikes at a used dealership first since the 250's at the MSF course weren't comparable to the ones I was looking at. That built up my confidence to test ride bikes from people selling their bikes themselves.  Best of luck!"

When looking at the performance of a bike look at the actual horsepower specs not just the engine size, for example the Vulcan S (650cc) produces more horsepower than the Vulcan 900.    When looking at bikes in general you want to sit on them to see how they feel.  When looking at used bikes it is all about maintenance and how much work has been done to a bike.  A well maintained bike will be much more reliable.  All things being equal a less modified bike will be more reliable than a heavily modified bike(less chance something got messed up when installing some random bit of junk)."

If you are trying to decide between to of the same type of bike get the one with the windshield, or crash bar, or floor boards, or all of the above over the one without.  You can always take those off if you don't like them, but I've spent almost a grand adding that stuff to mine.  It also helps to know the MFG of the aftermarket parts if at all possible.  If you want to add a luggage rack to your existing sissy bar, it's almost impossible unless you know the maker.  *If you buy two jackets (winter and summer) try on summer jackets without the liner, and winter jackets with the liner.  You'll likely never wear the summer jacket with the liner.  *DON'T BUY ANYTHING OFF THE INTERNET WITHOUT TRYING IT ON SOMEPLACE FIRST!  (something.. something... 3 friggen pairs of gloves before I got my current pair that fit... something)  *From what I've read and have experienced on my one bike, Honda gears are ""clunky"" on the cruisers.  Don't let that bug you too much when you test ride one.  *You'll end up with more than one helmet.  (see note above about not buying over the internet).  If you have a big head, 1/2 helmets make you look goofy, get over it or just don't buy one.  Full face are the safest, but 3/4 are MUCH cooler if you live where it gets hot.  *Viking bags are about the best price for saddle bags if you want to add them.  You can pay more but why.  *I didn't think a detachable windshield was a big deal when I bought mine, spend the extra money and get one.   *Great mileage doesn't mean what you think it means.  Sure you'll get 40-50 miles to the gallon, that doesn't mean you wont' be stopping every other day for gas, it's only a 4 gallon tank you know.  And 4 gallons is the MFG number, if the fill neck is in the middle you're not going to get all 4 gallons in.  *There is more, but I'll stop for now.

cruisers,343kdr,SGT_Crunch,3,Tue Apr 28 00:54:08 2015 UTC,What sort of troubles? Is cranking slow? Does it fire at all?  Also maybe try a thinner oil if you're running 20w-50.
cruisers,343kdr,drumstyx,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:25:44 2015 UTC,It will refuse to turn over. I can hear the starter going but to no avail.
cruisers,343kdr,drumstyx,2,Tue Apr 28 13:45:26 2015 UTC,"Doesn't turn the engine over at all, but the starter whirrs? That sounds like a starter clutch or something.  On the other hand, I've had a similar problem with just a weak battery. Try jumping it?"
cruisers,343kdr,drumstyx,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:01:56 2015 UTC,"i can hear it trying with that same repetitive firing sound, but the gas doesnt catch. Once it is warm enough, like upper fifties, it will start just fine first time. haha"
cruisers,343kdr,drumstyx,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:08:09 2015 UTC,"ah. Well I'd check the basics; fuel, fire (spark), and compression. Compression is unlikely to be the problem, spark is a maybe (pull the plug, put it in the boot and hold it against the engine to see a spark). So I'm going to guess fuel. When it's warm out, and the engine is cold, does it need choke at all to start? If it doesn't, you could be running rich at idle."
cruisers,343kdr,drumstyx,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:23:03 2015 UTC,"Ok maybe i was wrong haha It will make the starting sound, then it just makes a fast clicking sound."
cruisers,343kdr,fiddlestix42,2,Tue Apr 28 15:02:04 2015 UTC,"That's battery 100%. The clicking is the starter solenoid rapidly switching on and off (it gets enough power to activate, but then when the starter draws anything it switches off because the voltage drops).  Is it possible that you just don't ride so often in the cold? Do you keep it outside?  Anyway, just put it on a tender, it'll fire right up."

I think one of the common recommendations is Iridium spark plugs and a maintenance free battery. Vulcans like a hot start amd tend to struggle with cold starts.

cruisers,33zs2r,Dirtroadrocker,1 point,Tue Apr 28 09:21:03 2015 UTC,"Depends where precisely you live, however one of the beauties of living in the south west with a CBT is that until you go past Exeter you can go anywhere. Some of my favourite local areas include basically anywhere on Dartmoor but especially the ride from Plymouth to the north coast and then westwards along the coast on the A39 to Indian queens and returning on the A30 and A38, though on a 125 it might get a bit laborious!  That said when I had my 125 I road from Plymouth to Weymouth regularly by riding up the A38 turning off just before the M5 and then effectively following the coast via the A3052 - A35 - B3157.  It all depends though on endurance and the type of riding you want to do, I do 300 mile days now with alarming regularity on a big cruiser, but I remember when I first started out riding a hundred miles felt like long distance."
cruisers,33zs2r,hondabuilder,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:27:20 2015 UTC,"I have ridden both a 650 star and a 750 shadow. If it's comfort you're after, and you're a rather tall person: choose the star. If you're shorter, the shadow is a better choice.  The touring capabilities of both bikes aren't bad, but the extra 100 cc of the shadow give it an edge on highway, with just a little extra pull when you need it."
cruisers,33zs2r,hondabuilder,1 point,Mon Apr 27 11:02:52 2015 UTC,"http://i.imgur.com/qmWNBve.jpg http://i.imgur.com/BRuksuo.jpg  this is my 2004 Honda Shadow Aero 750cc. im into the entire build under 3500 after rego, its extremely reliable compared to every yamaha I've owned (quite a lot) and gets 50-60 MPG, comfortable.  in the past year and 3 months I've owned this as my daily driver, I've been doing 1k miles a week and many cross-country road trips. yesterday we did 300 miles around southern california, short ride really. tomorrow I'm riding it to Las Vegas for a job, then next week to north cali. and in between all those big rides, its still my daily vehicle for picking up groceries, doing laundry, etc.  I've owned an older dragstar 650 that I tried using for the same tasks. it did not have enough power, it was a maintainence nightmare, everything was always coming loose or needed adjustment.   that could have been my specific bike, but it is well known that Honda does lead in reliability and general quality/simplicity of their designs.   I don't want to steer you to either side, your choice is your choice. but I'd like to leave my two cents about the model lines.  In 2004 honda revamped the Shadow line of bikes with a new motor, frame, chassis, everything.   that same bike is still in production today. the 2004 and 2014 shadows are basically the same besides EFI on the latest ones, and the front disc is swapped to the right side of the rim for easier servicing and bleeding.   even the 2015 shadow is the exact same bike with a rear disc and EFI, and it does not look like they are going to renew the platform anytime soon, because it sells, and its proven tech that works.  what this means for people buying older shadows is parts availability. seats, fenders, lights, bars, pegs, air cleaners, exhaust, from all the newer shadows fit the 2004+ ones.  the differences between the Spirit/Aero/Phantom are just different paint schemes, bars, and fenders on the same chassis platform.   that means its easy to convert to a different style without having to pay a custom shop to fabricate everything from scratch.  my point is, in 2004, Honda made a Shadow that was so good, its still in production today with minor additions.   if your leaning towards one or the other, just get it. or else you will ALWAYS be wondering if the grass was greener on the other side.  get what you WANT for the first bike, then ride the complete shit out of it until you realize what you NEED in a bike.  your SECOND bike purchase is infinitely more important than your first, because you will bring a whole bunch of experience and knowledge to the table and be so much more informed.  all we can really do is tell you our personal opinions, but you need to form your own. I am biased towards Hondas, but I think you should go buy what you really want, not what we recommend."

For the 800cc Suzukis, there is a DJ Drive Mod which involves swapping out the entire final drive from a bigger machine for either a 10% or 14% taller gearing depending on where you source the parts. It's not exactly straight forward, you have to shorten the drive shaft (hard steel) and shorten the spacers that sit on the axle as well as widen the holes for the final drive mounting bolts. I've done it, and now I run 1k rpm less at 75mph. It's slower to accelerate now and has a lower top speed because (at my altitude of 7-11 k foot elevation) I don't have enough motor to turn the bigger gears. But riding above 75 mph is far more comfortable and less buzzy and I no longer try to shift up from top gear thinking that I'm still in fourth. Also, it'll do 93mph in third."

cruisers,33dfdp,cr0ft,3,Tue Apr 21 18:16:24 2015 UTC,"You can't push electricity. With electricity there is only draw.   The problem, if any, with running the vehicle comes from damage to the regulator due to overvoltage. Cars and motorcycles are constructed differently, and on a motorcycle, the regulator is responsible for keeping voltage at 14.1 volts or so, and the way it does this is by dissipating excess power as heat. If you jump from a running car, the excess voltage will sometimes be sufficiently high to literally overload and fry the regulator. Basically, the car and the motorcycle fight, and the car wins...  Amperage is not a problem at all, the problem is potential overvoltage from the car. The bike will only draw as many amps as it needs, regardless of how much is on offer.  Turning the car off lowers the voltage to what the car battery can do unaided, which is usually something over 12 volts, which is perfectly fine for a bike."

I had a 06 Vulcan 900 and took it on a LOT of road trips.  my opinion is that its really wide, it gets uncomfortable after awhile. for being a 900 it feels really choked/limited. it always had enough power not as much as you expect. MPG was OK but nothing amazing, if I remember correctly I got between 35-45 depending on how I was riding it (really wringing it out in town vs cruising at a steady rpm on highway)  if you get it dirt cheap, its worth it.  servicing it is a headache. not simple at all, if your planning on having a dealer or shop do it all, go for it. if you plan to tackle it yourself your in for more headache than its worth.  I AM a little biased but I would urge you to look at something like the shadow VTX1300.  very simple engine, tons of power, good gearing, VERY easy to do service on, just oil changes, brakes, tires, and valve adjustments.   I gave up my Vulcan 900 for a Shadow Aero 750.  its actually much quicker, cruises better at higher revs. dead simple to service and customize (the customize part is important for lots of riders) and more comfortable for ME in stock form. but everyones different.   whats cool about 2004+ Honda Shadows is that they are still in production. all the Aeros/Spirits/etc in dealership floors right now are the same bikes as the 2004+ shadows you can buy for under 3k used.  the only differences are the 2015 has a disc rear brake, and 2009+ is EFI instead of carb. and carb is way easier to tune for pipes and airbox, just swap the 50 and 125 jets for 52 and 130.  it's much more expensive to modify EFI for a simple pipes and airbox upgrade."

cruisers,335127,cantbuyathrill,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:21:33 2015 UTC,That's exactly why I picked the vtx over the 900.  No regrets.  Honda is the most solid brand out there.

I did meet a gentleman who rode his 900 with his Harley friends, and he said he had trouble keeping up at 75+ when they were passing at speeds higher than that. He swapped out the stock exhaust, changed the intake and added a new controller, and he said it made it a whole new bike which kept up just fine. He felt he got a 25% boost by doing it."

I didn't care for the amount of vibration at 70+ MPH. If the vibration doesn't annoy you then it's fine for long trips. It'll get blown around a bit more since it's lighter than a bigger bike as well. The lightness makes it accelerate quickly and easier to ride around town though. I started doing longer (2,000+ mile) road trips and it just wasn't the right bike for that in my opinion."

I was having lower back problems on longer trips so I added a lower back rest I picked up on e-bay and took about 10m to install. What it did for me is scoot my butt forward a few inches on the seat so I found myself sitting more upright almost 'leaning back'. That might be an inexpensive solution to your issue if you're not willing to spend 100's of dollars on a mustang seat. It sounds like you are leaning forward a bit too much squashing your manly block&tackle. There are also seat covers you can get that add a bit more cushion for the pushin? sorry bout that  Here are similar items to the backrest I ordered

cruisers,32fo8x,tinycaper,5,Mon Apr 13 12:34:02 2015 UTC,"Sound about right for a first time bike. My first bike after MSF was a Shadow 750. I considered a 250, but at 6'2"", 230lbs, I was warned that it had no get up and go, and after a month I'd be looking to get something bigger. Last year a moved to a 1500cc bike after 3 years on the Shadow, because I felt I had enough experience and control that I could handle the bigger bike.  250cc bikes I think work great in environments that are full of smaller bikes. But in the US, you're going to get pushed around on Interstates, and you'll want to move up quickly. 600cc or higher is a good starter. It's what I intend to get for my sons when they start riding."
cruisers,32fo8x,Deezul_AwT,2,Mon Apr 13 13:47:00 2015 UTC,"I never really understood this to be honest. I live in CA and with my first v-star 650 I could easily accelerate to pass on the freeway. A typical 650 cruiser performed better than any typical sedan on the road in terms of acceleration. People who push others to get bikes that ""get up and go"" sound to me like elitists who want to rub their 1800cc 100+ hp bikes in other peoples faces. I eventually upgraded because hey... it's more fun and the gearing was lower. I don't buy the ""you NEED"" argument one bit though. I'm happy with 80hp and some people are hungry for more, and others are happy with vespa's (not a cruiser I know, don't kill me).  (rant over)"

cruisers,32fo8x,Shpadoinkles,2,Mon Apr 13 20:59:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be too scared of figure eights, it's mostly body positioning... also, remember that you always have a clutch for low speed manuvers.  You need to worry about more important stuff to stay alive...  Make eye contact with drivers as often as possible, so you know they know you are there.  Avoid blind spots, and assume anyone who is on a phone is not going to use a blinker.  As for riding, remember:  Don't brake through corners, or in the corner at all.  Entry point and entry speed are key, don't focus at all on body positioning around a corner quite yet, let the bike lean naturally for now, get the feel of it.   Go find some well paved and clean twisties that you can repeatedly navigate at a safe speed, and practice finding the apex.  The object is basically to take the corner in the most gradual curve possible, outside inside outside, to avoid losing that entry speed, naturally keeping the bike a bit more upright, so you can maintain as much contact patch on your tire as possible and accelerate out of the corner!  You will notice pro racing circuit riders leaned over at 60 degree angles and whatnot, but don't worry about it, that's some really high speed stuff!  Also, if you lose rear wheel traction at any point, don't let off of the throttle, get straight and then ease off.  Read this book:  http://files.meetup.com/1510087/A+Twist+of+the+Wrist+II.pdf"

I believe a Honda shadow and a Suzuki Boulevard were tested against it and the only thing those 2 had on the Virago was looks.  If there are other issues with these Viragos list some so I and others may know.  My opinion: yes, it's a good buy. If you have any questions about it ask me. Check to see if it has one carb or 2. Some people (myself included) convert these bikes to single carbs."
cruisers,31vev7,98_Camaro,2,Wed Apr 8 20:05:32 2015 UTC,"I ended up buying it. Runs great, just needs a little TLC. It does still have two carbs, I may look into changing them in the future. It had Jardine slash cuts on it and sounds nice. I actually hate the floorboards though, found a set of pegs on eBay to replace them."

I'm similar height/weight to you, and I owned a 2002 Honda Sabre 1199. If anything, it was still a little too weak for me, but it would be PERFECT for a beginner.   Plus, shaft drive, so you don't have to worry about maintenance.   Additionally, it's the tallest cruiser I've ever ridden, so that's the cherry on top.  Seriously, look for an 02 Sabre, you will NOT regret it."

I looked at many of your same choices.  I went with an 09 Vulcan 900 Custom.  I paid $4400 cash with 7200 miles and it was flawless.  Love the 21"" front wheel and that rake!    It's snug, not something I'd want to commute for 3 hours daily on but for my 22 mile round trip commute it's awesome.  If I had the spare cash, I'm sure forward controls and some mini apes would be perfect.  The 900 gave me enough power to do everything I wanted for a first bike but was small enough that I never felt over powered.  Day trips are a blast.  It does need a 6th gear though for long rides.  If you're urban riding or under 200 miles daily often, I'd highly recommend it. If you plan on hauling a 1 up, the Vulcan tops out at 438# loaded.  The S50 fit pretty well except for the handle bars were pretty low and hit my knees at lock.  Not often you're turning that sharp but when you do, you probably need to.  Assuming you're a responsible adult and have some fucking restraint, I'd recommend looking at the Honda VTX 1100.  Much better fitting bike, has the power to pull us big boys around and maybe a 1 up eventually.  After 1 year with my 900, I'm looking at selling it and going to the VTX 1300 or 1800."

cruisers,31rlhi,GrillBears,1 point,Tue Apr 7 20:04:46 2015 UTC,The 1300 vtx is a little on the heavier side (678–748 lbs dry/wet) so those 1300cc's are put to use a bit.  I think you will find it's pretty nice cutting through the wind and holding a good line on the highway.

The Vstar is fuel injected which I've grown to love (1300 vtx is carburated 1800 vtx is fuel injected) and I like the dual disc front brakes on the Yamaha (1300 vtx one front disc 1800 vtx 2).  The one thing about the VTX I prefer though is the shaft drive over the belt but that's not a real big issue to me. They are both water cooled. The Vstar is lighter 624 dry, 668 wet. That Vstar of my brothers runs and rides real nice it seemed to have a bit more pep to it than the 1300 vtx I use to own.

I'm 6'3"", 180lbs and ride a 1500cc with no issues. New handlebars or risers will also definitely help you feel less cramped for space.

I was looking at these two bikes  http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/mcy/4950768775.html http://washingtondc.craigslist.org/nva/mcy/4966587937.html  In the first listing it said something about the carb.  is that something to be concerned about?
cruisers,31rlhi,just_some_tech,2,Thu Apr 9 22:49:41 2015 UTC,"first bikes issue is not a carb problem. owner is misinformed.  he has open pipes on it.  popping is normal and stock mufflers are designed to quiet it so you dont hear it.    there is no ""fix"" it just happens because on deceleration, the engine sucks in fresh air and does not completely burn it, it goes into the muffler and burns there creating the popping sound.  happens on almost every engine.  fuel injection is good at stopping it because it just shuts off all fuel flow when the throttle is closed, cant do that with carbs.  I wouldn't worry about it but I would consider a new set of pipes.  another ""fix"" a lot of people do is to use WAY too rich of a pilot jet so when the motor is engine braking, it sucks more fuel than air into the exhaust so it cannot ignite. but it hurts idle and MPG.  this is most commonly what you will see as the ""fix"" for popping mufflers but its not true, now you know the real reason it happens.  both seem like solid bikes so its up to you from here on out"

I really like the look of these Hondas and the 1100 seems perfect after what this thread said. So the one with the popping, don't worry about it, use the right pilot jet, and consider new pipes.   I was looking at this one too (which is much  more local) http://richmond.craigslist.org/mcy/4912634270.html   and saw that it needed new tires. Which i am figuring will cost a few hundred.

I usually don't pay retail price for parts but I had to this time since i didnt actually plan in advance to change the tire.   came out to 111 for the tire and 25 for tube, 15 for installation since I no longer have a tire machine.  tires are not so bad.  any bike you get though, you should plan on doing the front brake pads ASAP whether they need it or not, just for peace of mind. and oil change/valve adjustment. so you can count the miles for the next service appointments from that moment onwards."

In fact when I was on Cycle Trader and CL I would search both. The real issue is that the High/Hardball were still so new and they were expensive as balls compared to an used Raider. I found this one in California and drove 12 hours to pick it up. Best buy of the century. Maybe down the road I might still pick up a Hardball but with 125lb of torque was too easy not to pass up for now.

I ride it rain, hail or shine.  Thus far no issues, my fuel pump was replaced under the recall but I hadn't noticed the issue at all (although from experience with cages that's hardly surprising). I've found it to be a hugely reliable bike, I do 80 km's (50 miles) a day most week days and see a lot of broken down bikes, gratefully I haven't joined them.  Once upon a time Harley did have a bad rep - at least here they did, then again so did Ducati (the joke being you had to be a motorcycle mechanic to ride one). That doesn't seem to be the case any more - my personal thoughts are, if you maintain the bike properly, ie change the oil regularly and within schedule, swap out / clean filters where and when necessary, chain/belt  checking/adjustment where necessary and so on you put yourself in good stead to avoid mechanical failures. There's always stuff that can't be avoided, but regular maintenance can help prevent it and detect failings early before there an issue.   I concur with the other users post about asking over at /r/victorymotorcyles as well. Away from Reddit you can also check with the VRN (Victory Riders Network) and VRG (Victory Riders Group) - like all things though, heading to their dedicated space means you'll get overwhelmingly positive answers given the demographic (not that that's always a bad thing)."

cruisers,3053z3,hondabuilder,3,Tue Mar 24 16:20:01 2015 UTC,"I'm running a memphis shades batwing on my Honda Shadow Aero.  http://i.imgur.com/qmWNBve.jpg  the SSCC one linked by TheSherbs looks extremely similar.  as I use one on my daily driver, there are some things you should know about these batwings.  since they are a ""universal"" fit (sort of) they are not tailored to the aerodynamics of each particular bike. It works GREAT on my Aero and I get zero wind in my eyes (open face helmet) even at freeway speeds.   I am running the 7 inch windshield, not a low profile one.  secondly, when you're running the batwing alone, without the wind deflectors, wind WILL come up in that area, into the low pressure zone behind the fairing and in front of your chest, and will force cold air up into your helmet, in your jacket, etc.  Get the wind deflectors... seriously. especially if your goal is to ride in cold weather.  other than that, the memphis shades brackets are EXTREMELY over priced and you could EASILY make custom mounts with some 5mm steel strap, a drill press, and a welder.   its really just using the triple tree clamps, the kit removes the original bolts, supplies longer ones with a spacer, and the fairing bracket goes between the spacer and bolt so it doesnt touch the triple trees.  easily cloned with home depot/Lowes bolts/hardware.  as for quality, I can only vouch for memphis shades, but its been installed on my bike, done about 15k miles in the past 9 months so far, the vibration expanded the mounting holes in the windshield and started to rattle at certain RPMs, so I've had to put a foam sheet between the windscreen and fairing to stop that.  no cracks, no damage. the gloss black finish on it held up GREAT."
cruisers,3053z3,hondabuilder,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:09:29 2015 UTC,"Cool deal. Yeah I definitely wanted the upper windshield for whatever fairing I get since wind is my primary concern, would take it off in the spring.   I don't know if I'm mechanically inclined to make custom brackets, but if one is a close fit I could probably modify what's there. Could probably add foam or rubber into the mounting whenever I do the initial install since I know it'll happen. Thanks."
cruisers,3053z3,KirbyinAustin,1 point,Tue Mar 24 18:13:58 2015 UTC,"I forgot to mention that Memphis Shades mounts are universal  if you have the brackets installed on your bike, any fairing they make will slide onto it!  http://www.memphisshades.com/metric-shades/metric-sportshields/el-paso-for-metric  this seems to be the only windshield they offer for the Bolt  and looking at it, I can see they are using the universal fork tube clamps rather than a custom bracket for the bolt.  this might be a good option for you.  I also forgot to add that the batwing does little to keep wind off your hands, this is because instead of wind hitting from the front, cold air actually rushes in from behind to fill the low pressure area right behind the fairing and you get just as much cold air hitting your hand, just from the other direction.   that El Paso shield and grip warmers might be just the ticket to keeping your bike comfy"

cruisers,2zq0t3,HD3D,3,Fri Mar 27 07:01:34 2015 UTC,"The bike should definitely be repairable, but I would take it to a pro if you suspect any issues with a gas leak. Catching fire mid ride would look kind of cool but not be very cool.   Sounds like classic target fixation took you to the curb, happens to just about everyone at least once. The only way to avoid it is solid muscle memory gained through repetition of proper technique.  I would suggest finding a traffic free side road or parking lot to mess around in for a few hours. It took me about a week of riding my first bike (VTX1300, similar to the vulcan) to get a feel for the gears. Takes a little bit of practice to get used to high torque during slow turns, and knowing what gear is best.  And yeah, definitely get a new helmet. They are only designed to absorb a single impact."
cruisers,2zq0t3,drumstyx,1 point,Fri Mar 20 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely class target fixation. I know I could've corrected by simply letting off the throttle and getting my eyes back on the road. What I plan to do is fix the little things that I can and then take it to a shop to get any major stuff I can't do or don't notice repaired. Hopefully its just a few hundred dollars, but its the handle bars i'm worried about"
cruisers,2zq0t3,drumstyx,1 point,Fri Mar 20 21:53:52 2015 UTC,"The 'loose fuel line' and 'possible fuel leak' could very well be related. Fuel leaks don't usually occur from such a minor incident; the tank isn't even scratched.  Also keep in mind that tipping the bike will have let some fuel out of the cap (and carbs...the 800 still has carbs right?) and possibly put some fuel where it doesn't belong, which is why it might be 'leaking' days later.  On my 900, the seat is key-release, and there's a latch. If that's the case on the 800, then almost 100% it'll just pop back on.  The bars, well you'll need new bars. That happens after almost any crash, big or small; handlebars are unfortunately weaker than they look. You'll probably need to align/destress the upper and lower triple tree too.  I'm betting that the most replacement-intensive part of the repair (other than swapping the bars...that's a bit of a pain) will be the right side stuff. I could be wrong, but brake pedals and footrests don't just come off, they break off. That means something is broken for each. It'll only be a bracket of some sort for each one, but still, you'll have to figure out what it is and replace it...no way around it."
cruisers,2zq0t3,drumstyx,2,Sat Mar 21 14:39:15 2015 UTC,"Ok got it, that makes a lot of sense. I just tried reconnected my rear brake lever and its clear that it was broken right off; guessing that entire bracket will need to be replaced like you mentioned. Thanks!"
cruisers,2zq0t3,tgwill,2,Sat Mar 21 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't be expensive to get everything back in shape really. I mean, it'll be more than the $0 you were expecting to have to spend on it, but it's not as bad as one might expect from such an accident. If I had to guess, I'd say around $150-400 total max. Substantially less if you can get used parts rather than going through the dealer."

I'd check that first, then all the ground connections for corrosion, then drain the tank, fill with fresh gas and seafoam and it should run.  at WORST, the idle jets will be clogged and it will only run on choke, but if you used stabil last summer the seafoam should clear out what very small amount of varnish is in the carbs, without you having to tear them down.  worst case, you take out the carb, clean it, put it back together and its fine.  but if you can avoid that step, might as well."

cruisers,2zlruq,fatlace,2,Thu Mar 19 21:02:47 2015 UTC,"I have an '03 V-Star 1100. If your engine is turning over and not just trying to turn, it's probably not the starter. Put your hand at the exhaust outlet at the end of the pipes and see if your cranking it puffs out air. If it moves air out the pipes, your engine is turning. If your electrical system (plugs and wires) is good, you're likely looking at fuel. Maybe something clogged in a filter, or the pump is frozen. I know the 1100s have a procedure where you can remove the fuel pump and render it a simple gravity-fed system.  The requirements for basic engine starting are air, fuel, spark and timing. If you feel puffs at the exhaust, it's not air. Electrical systems age predictably, and you say you replaced plugs and battery, so I'm disinclined to think it's electrical. Timing on these engines is mechanical, and if you don't hear any terrible metal-on-metal noise and it hasn't seen physical action since it last ran, disinclined to blame timing. That leaves fuel delivery.  I would suggest bypassing the fuel pump and run directly to the carb fuel inlet from the petcock. It's handy to have one of those clear inline fuel filters that not only keep your carbs free of bits of gunk, but also provide a visual on moving fuel in the lines."

cruisers,2zlruq,TheSherbs,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:22:01 2015 UTC,"Carbs are easy, the fuel system isn't pressurized.

So, I drained the gas tank, replaced it with fresh gas and about 7 ounces of seafoam.   Then I let it run for a few minutes, shut it off for about 15 minutes and let it run for a half hour.    That'd seemed to do the trick, it starts right up now,but we will see tomorrow if it starts again, if not I'm going to say fuck it and clean the carbs and replace the jets"

The nice part about the Cobra exhaust is that they sell all different kinds of baffles for it and they are VERY easy to change. I know you are looking for the exact opposite I was.  My recommendation:  If you are looking for a change, go to dealerships and check out the used bikes.  Most will have some sort of exhaust modification as its a very popular thing to do.  This way you can check out bikes with your same engine and different exhausts without spending any money.  Good luck OP!"

That should give you plenty of space and be easily removable to maintain your bikes looks for everyday riding.   Essentially though any bike can tour, your just have to accept the limitations of a given touring platform and work with it."
cruisers,2yz9nk,Lauranis,2,Sat Mar 14 02:34:09 2015 UTC,How much effect can aftermarket parts like a new seat realistically have on these limitations?
cruisers,2yz9nk,dchelix,2,Sat Mar 14 03:07:01 2015 UTC,"Depends what you want. Many storage options are out there but storage will be the least of your worries. If your touring you're going to really want cruise control or a throttle lock, highway bars, and a windshield. Touring bikes come with these things for good reason."
cruisers,2yz9nk,mist91,2,Sat Mar 14 04:32:10 2015 UTC,"You can get a more cushioned seat and I've seen a back rest for the rider. I own a bolt. I have a highway bar that I can rest my feet on during longer rides. It's pretty comfortable, but I ride at about 75 if I go anywhere more than a half hour away. Closer and I sometimes crank it a bit more to 85."
cruisers,2yz9nk,clust10,2,Sat Mar 14 05:51:54 2015 UTC,"I regretted purchasing a 650 V Star last year, because I thought Id never be comfortable using it for touring.

cruisers,2yz9nk,cr0ft,3,Wed Mar 18 13:57:55 2015 UTC,"You can tour on anything up to and including a bicycle. Some things are just somewhat less optimized for that. The Bolt should be fine. You may have to dial back on the length per day depending on comfort but it's still a japanese bike with great reliability. Just add on some luggage in one way or another and you're good to go.  Honestly, the only thing you need to really think about is seating position. Are you comfortable sitting on it for hours on end or not? If not, can it easily be altered so you are, ie better seat, highway footpegs, back rest, what have you? Mustang makes a wide solo seat for it for instance. Really, any bike in the cruiser class should be considered a basic do-it-yourself bike, some of the fun is in making it your own.  Everything beyond that can be fixed. A nice windshield of some kind, some form of bags and a luggage rack and you really are good to go. None of it has to be permanently mounted either if you prefer the bike naked for short runs."

That's what attracts new riders to it and that's ok! However, you could quickly become dissatisfied with it when you realize how little power it has for highway riding and how uncomfortable it will be at those speeds. Don't buy a particular bike for the wrong reasons.  The honest truth is that your bike can go anywhere, and that's what can be great about motorcycle adventures. However, you have to accept the fact that Yamaha didn't design that bike for touring; so it's going to be uncomfortable and require frequent stops just so you can get off and let your muscles relax.   Just my 2 cents."

There are guys that take long trips on hardtailed xs650s, though.  It's all about what you're willing to put up with there. And as far as luggage, just pack light. And once you think it's light enough, eliminate half the stuff.  One of the guys that went on our road trip to Texas only took a tarp, wool blanket, 2 changes of clothes, an axe, and a metal cup."
cruisers,2yz9nk,Dirtroadrocker,1 point,Sat Mar 14 14:05:45 2015 UTC,"I've found that gearing matters a bit more than displacement.  I've ridden some 500-600cc bikes that have really tall top gears and can cruise at 80 mph at a low enough RPM to not be annoying.  gearing will matter more than displacement as long as its a generally well designed motor with enough low end grunt. motors that make their power in the higher RPMs are geared shorter so the bike is in those high ranges at freeway speeds, which means its constantly revving high, extremely annoying for hours on end is the main effect, really, but its a huge one.   I agree though, small displacement isn't the end all be all.  I build mid-size touring bikes out of Honda Shadow 750s because they are super lightweight, get amazing MPG, cruise all day at 90mph, and look great as tourers.  http://i.imgur.com/T26O8LJ.jpg    http://i.imgur.com/mhZHGXa.jpg"

I sure didn't feel anything until i did that.

He can easily pull away from my stock 900 at just about any speed. But when he ran it on a dyno he only gained a few horsepower, somewhere around 5-10hp."
cruisers,2yxtfr,k3mik4l,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:25:16 2015 UTC,I wouldn't really do it for the hp increase but what it will do is allow you to keep the engine running too lean and too hot which will let your bike last longer. That's the biggest benefit here.  I upgraded the air intake on my bike and that seemed to make the biggest difference to the power band. Much more high rev power.

cruisers,2yyu7f,hondabuilder,1 point,Sat Mar 14 06:04:30 2015 UTC,Thanks so much for your answer. The tank is pretty badly rusted I was told that it would be better to get a new one than cleaning it out since the rust would come back after a while. What do you think?
cruisers,2yyu7f,hondabuilder,1 point,Sat Mar 14 09:53:25 2015 UTC,"sounds ridiculous to me, rust CAN ""come back"" but only under the right conditions.  where bare metal meets moist air, rust forms.  if you have the gas tank totally de-rusted by a radiator shop, and you constantly keep the bike full of gas you wont have any problems.  what I mean by constantly keep it filled, is basically, don't let it sit longer than a few days with an empty tank. overnight or day or two wont show instant rust.  basically if you know the tanks low on gas and you aren't going to ride for a week or so, fill up the tank, the gas against the metal seals it up and you get no rust.  this is how bikes ship from the factory, they expect you to ride it like that anyway.  if the rust is so deep that it goes all the way through to the paint, then yeah, youll need a new tank, but you wont know the extent of it until you bring it somewhere to have the rust removed anyway. you might have a perfectly good tank"

Motion Pro is what you would get if they order via Parts Unlimited at any shop, good brand.  having some kind of coverage plan that can help you on the side of the road will help.

I broke down and had the right tools to fix my stuff. ALSO MAKE SURE YOU retighten you license plate after a long ride. I lost mine once... not a fun time getting a new one. anyway good luck!"
cruisers,2yee3m,ItsALeagueGame,2,Mon Mar 9 03:32:54 2015 UTC,"Since you said it's new to you I'd go ahead and change the final drive oil while you are at it besides what others in this thread have mentioned.  A lot of people seem to neglect doing that.  Last summer I drove my VTX from Michigan to Sturgis and up through Wyoming.  My favorite thing about that vacation was just simply the ride!  Also, this may just be my opinion but if your bike still has a stock Honda seat that might wear on you a little bit.  I have a Mustang seat with a backrest that you can easily pop in and out.  That backrest was a godsend on that trip.  Here's a couple pictures from that trip if you were interested.  I hope you have as good of time as I did!  http://imgur.com/a/kIca6"
cruisers,2yee3m,ItsALeagueGame,1 point,Mon Mar 9 10:38:32 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll definitely look into it. I have a Corbin seat on it which I love. I have been able to ride for hours on end with no issues at all.
