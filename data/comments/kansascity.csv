kansascity,3e48f8,poolplyr27,42,Tue Jul 21 20:54:28 2015 UTC,"MCI is awful for vacationers who want a nice fancy airport and restaurants to eat at... but for business travelers like myself, I can't imagine a better airport. I can show up 45 minutes before my flight and be completely fine. We benefit heavily from the multiple TSA check's in each terminal, it keeps those lines moving far faster than they do in single-terminal set-ups. I get that it's not a perfect airport, but if those flying out of the airport end up paying the costs over time in higher fares, how is it worth it?"
kansascity,3e48f8,HoosierDadddy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:40:37 2015 UTC,Airlines pay the fees and want a new terminal with the higher fees.  Businesses who pay for their business travelers (that account for like 70 percent of fliers) are down for a new terminal with the higher fees. Seems like a no brainer if those who front most of the costs are for it.
kansascity,3e48f8,PhilTotola,4,Tue Jul 21 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"So wait, are you saying this won't be built largely by taxpayers?"
kansascity,3e48f8,Sparkykc124,5,Tue Jul 21 22:12:54 2015 UTC,"It's funded totally by fees paid at the airport by airlines (landing fees, leases, etc.), and airport customers.  Are some of those users of the airport also taxpayers?  Of course.  Here are the KCI financials: https://www.flykci.com/media/1312/fye14-cafr-final-report-123014.pdf"
kansascity,3e48f8,PhilTotola,5,Tue Jul 21 22:43:28 2015 UTC,"Those are operating expenses. They do include debt, almost 1/4 billion, but it's not clear to me what that debt is from. Are they going to take on another billion in debt? Let me just say that I have a simple mind and once dollars get over a few million I have no understanding of them."
kansascity,3e48f8,Sparkykc124,2,Wed Jul 22 00:24:01 2015 UTC,Debt is from prior improvements among other things.  The bonds they would issue for this renovation would be backed by the same fees (as reported in the presentation given to the city today)
kansascity,3e48f8,PhilTotola,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the info. Either way I believe construction jobs are good for the area and support any expansion at the airport but I sure am gonna miss leaving my house an 1-1/2 hours before my flight departs, including parking."
kansascity,3e48f8,Sparkykc124,2,Wed Jul 22 00:55:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think the length of time will increase, that should be a big point of emphasis in selling this thing and designing it...if anything, it may go faster depending on what airport services you are using (TSA precheck, checking bags, economy parking could be closer/faster, etc)."
kansascity,3e48f8,PhilTotola,3,Wed Jul 22 00:59:07 2015 UTC,"I'm an airport customer, and I'm not for it. :) I would agree that if airlines pay the majority of the fees, why not... but I haven't seen a breakdown with some estimate of how much would be passed on to airport customers. Until then, we have a stalemate."
kansascity,3e48f8,HoosierDadddy,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:39:49 2015 UTC,Yeah that breakdown would be great information.  As a business traveler your company is paying your extra fee you'll be spending anyways...unless self-employed...  another good bit of info they should also provide is average increase to a average flier per trip.  I'm guessing it's a buck or two.
kansascity,3e48f8,PhilTotola,-4,Wed Jul 22 00:43:44 2015 UTC,"This is actually not true. On average the multiple queue model is less efficient than a single queue with multiple servers.   I remember having to model this with a computer program to simulate the queue. This article is essentially the same project. Worse yet, you cannot argue that line shortness can be used as a heuristic to pick the best line since you must use the one corresponding with the gate.   Basically this is inefficient both in labor costs and for wait time. The airport sucks.  http://statistical-research.com/waiting-in-one-line-or-multiple-lines/"
kansascity,3e48f8,slashetsy,9,Tue Jul 21 22:14:31 2015 UTC,"That's not quite the same though. In MCI there is a single security entrance per group of gates (the smallest I've soon is 4 gates I believe). If they go to a single multiple server entrance point, they won't have a server for every 4 gates, not even close.  I agree it's not labor efficient, but even when I've travelled during busier times I've only been in a security line with people on my own flight."
kansascity,3e48f8,Spirkus,7,Tue Jul 21 22:34:40 2015 UTC,"You're point is normally true, but not in this case. This is indeed very inefficient with labor costs, but I recall reading a past article that said that was all TSA labor, and wasn't MCI's cost. Wish I could find that now, but basically the layout requires far more TSA agents per flier than normal... And as a result, we benefit with shorter lines. Again, this only helps if we don't pay the cost of those agents."
kansascity,3e48f8,HoosierDadddy,3,Tue Jul 21 22:44:51 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I'll take a line at MCI over MDW any day."
kansascity,3e48f8,viveislife,8,Wed Jul 22 00:41:58 2015 UTC,Remodeling a whole airport just to have a common security gate for all terminals to enable more commercial shops inside security is retarded.
kansascity,3e48f8,viveislife,11,Wed Jul 22 00:41:08 2015 UTC,"KCI is one of, if not the most convenient ""curb-to-gate"" airports in the country. However, in terms of amenities and location, it might be the worst. I can't imagine what it's like to have a layover at KCI.  The location in respect to downtown, the Plaza and JoCo could not be worse. I wish they would just scrap KCI entirely and start over somewhere else. Of course, this isn't really the city's fault as the airport was almost entirely designed by TWA who bolted for St. Louis once KCI was determined to have security shortcomings soon after it was built.  It's too far away, it's half abandoned, it's not cost effective, airlines don't like it. Turn it into a freight airport and start over somewhere else OR build a new terminal at the south end of the property and eliminate 10 minutes off the drive from anywhere south of the airport for 90% of the passengers."
kansascity,3e48f8,Bombay66,5,Tue Jul 21 22:31:27 2015 UTC,"The removal of quiznos was stupid because that was actually decently priced.  The fact is they just want to set up shops that price gouge off a common entry point hoping they get business, there is no real advantage to the traveler if they remodel MCI."
kansascity,3e48f8,viveislife,3,Wed Jul 22 00:44:27 2015 UTC,"At this point, you'd have to put it in DeSoto or somewhere similar to find that much land without drowning in NIMBY complaints. Better for JoCo, worse for just about everyone else."

""We need to add all of these seats and update the arena to get the bigger conventions and concerts!! and our feasibility study says so!!"". How much did the construction companies make on that farce?   How much money will be wasted on the MCI updates that were completed not too long ago if they just rip it down?   How many more times are we going to let them pull this type of crap? It is real money they are wasting and now some people want to tear down Kemper arena."

Is it my quick assumption to corruption here, or am I crazy?  The cost of every flight goes up $XX.XX just to line the pockets of the construction industry???     Why is this even on the table?  There are plenty of restaurants for the layover people."

Easy to get in and out of an airport that doesn't have any people in it.  The thing is, back in the day (pre-9/11... actually you'd probably have to go back further than that maybe) it was a busier airport. TWA hubbed here, a few other now defunct airlines hubbed here. But after 9/11 with all the increased security measures, KCI didn't really have a lot of options to adhere to higher security without sacrificing it's precious little terminal real estate. Passenger processing time probably went way down and/or airlines realized that KCI is terribly inefficient and so they left for larger greener pastures.

kansascity,3e3qih,bryanKU,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:34 2015 UTC,How's the Cosentinos park view? And how far can you ride the elevator up before you have to go to the stairs?
kansascity,3e3qih,yousmelllikearainbow,5,Tue Jul 21 20:14:54 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the elevator goes up to the rooftop level.  Here's a photo sphere I found on Google maps that gives you a nice 360 view of the park and surrounding buildings.    P&L Rooftop Park 360 photo sphere
kansascity,3e3qih,bryanKU,3,Tue Jul 21 20:23:52 2015 UTC,Wow. Thanks for this. I have lived here 4 years and been downtown more times than I can count and never knew this place existed.

kansascity,3e2n4k,Weaubleau,5,Tue Jul 21 15:08:31 2015 UTC,I hope this will include redesigning the kitchen to allow for making call-in orders separately from those who actually came into the store.  All of the stores in Olathe have a huge line every day for lunch and dinner and they always get bogged down due to call-in orders.  Nothing like waiting in line for 20 minutes only for them to ask you to wait while they make another call-in order.
kansascity,3e2n4k,SteampunkGeisha,4,Tue Jul 21 16:16:48 2015 UTC,"You can use the app on your phone to order for yourself, or a group, with individualized orders.  The one on College & 69 even has a separate window/register for call-in, fax, and pickup orders.  More locations need this."
kansascity,3e2n4k,Joegotbored,2,Tue Jul 21 19:13:48 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, I know I could call-in or use an app to make orders, but in Olathe there is no separate place to pick up those orders.  You have to walk past a very long line of people to pick your food up at the checkout.  And I agree -- something needs to be done to improve this process for more locations.  It angers me to have to wait for call-ins to be processed when I have to wait in line, I don't want to be a hypocrite and do the same to others."
kansascity,3e2n4k,SteampunkGeisha,11,Tue Jul 21 20:33:18 2015 UTC,That is a fucking awful design. Restaurants that aim to make their dining rooms less pleasant lose my business. I refuse to eat in the car and if I was going to eat at home anyhow I would just cook there.

kansascity,3e0u72,JonnyBox,5,Tue Jul 21 15:13:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good design concept actually.  A smallish ship with conservative crew requirements, the speed to run down almost anything that floats, or evade anything it can't fight head on.  For a small ship, it has aviation facilities that put destroyers to shame and are on par with cruisers that are 4-5x its displacement.  This allows for huge flexibility as a fast helicopter/drone carrier.  The modular design and excess power generation capacity allow for tailoring to specific mission requirements; and the gun, while small, is well suited to wrecking speedboats, which happen to be about the only thing out there that moves fast enough to catch it.  I think too many people envision the LSC as a Frigate with a shitty gun and not enough armor, when it is really a high speed helicopter carrier that just happens to have a gun for self defense."

Nothing like having to have a large bucket in your room every time it stormed.  The appliances were falling apart and very old.  I only lived there because it was easier since there was literally no drive.  I had nothing but a bad experience there.  My old place was right by the Rockhill garage.  The only places I've seen them put money into are the frat houses in the circle drive.  There is housing on the plaza.

kansascity,3e3jlw,queenofkingcity,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:14:59 2015 UTC,"They really aren't saying anything.  But in the end, all of those houses will come down.  They either buy them or they inherit them.  If a house goes up for sale in that area, it is pretty much going to go to UMKC.    A few years ago they tried to force homeowners to sell, but the homeowners revolted.  Basically UMKC is out of room.  They tore down the chancellor's house to build the business school.  It is unlikely that they will maintain more than a few houses (for frats)  They are just waiting until they have enough real estate to build something.    Once they have enough contiguous property, they will start tearing houses down.  It may take a few years to get enough though."

A small non-profit got a $22,000 grant from that fund, but they say they never applied for it.  The person that applied for it, and used the non-profit's name and tax ID number, says he was told to apply by... Ann Murguia."
kansascity,3dz1ib,HossCartwright,9,Mon Jul 20 23:11:10 2015 UTC,Quite the ballsy move considering the active FBI investigation on City  graft going on right now at KCMO city hall.

I have no idea how internal FBI politics work or whether workload is divided up across state lines, but it seems reasonable that if the FBI team responsible for investigating graft in KCMO can also deliver up WyCo, there'd be more promotion opportunity for them."
kansascity,3dz1ib,FETT7022,3,Mon Jul 20 23:03:06 2015 UTC,KS has its own office for fbi so I doubt they can make anything across state lines happen unless they literally tie together.

She's tight with Brownback and the Koch brothers and her husband's a federal judge. I'm not sure if that really amounts to anything or if the ethics department here is just spineless.

kansascity,3dz1ib,HillDrag0n,2,Mon Jul 20 23:15:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, here's an old article on a couple of mailings that went out for her when she ran for Mayor. One from Americans for Prosperity and one from a political consultant for conservative Republicans. Brownback also appointed her to the Board of Regents as a ""Democrat.""    I'm pretty sure she even had Brownback staffers working her campaign for mayor. They stick out like a sore thumb at Wyandotte County neighborhood group meetings."
kansascity,3dz1ib,ChaosMotor,-4,Tue Jul 21 00:07:02 2015 UTC,That is complete and utter bullshit.  Ann Murgia (like ALL politicians in Wyandotte County) is 100% democrat.  I live in the 3rd district and have met with Commissioner Murgia on many occasions.  IMHO she does a fantastic job of representing her district.  She got caught playing political games.  That is how government works.  She is not corrupt.  The mayor is a petty little bitch and there is a deep divide in our current board.    Gloat if you want....but don't pretend she is a republican.

There may be others. Chaat means, approximately, snacks. Indian and Pakistani street foods. My recommendation is to visit both as often as you can and eat your way through the chaat menus. It will be a revelation ... and a delight. Westerners who like Indo/Pakistani food usually know about samosas and pakoras, but there is a much, much larger range of subcontinental street snacks worth trying, and unlike most Westerners, we have access to them here."

Newcomer Kulture Kurry is pretty good, although they don't have a traditional lunch buffet like most Indian places.  Flavor of India (by 87th & Quivira) has a pretty good lunch buffet.

kansascity,3dxnlw,Avuja,4,Mon Jul 20 13:27:37 2015 UTC,"When my GF and I moved in, we felt that the unit's rent was below market value, and feared that we would experience a significant rent hike after our first year. To our surprise, we renewed our lease a few months ago, and there was absolutely no change in our rent.   Noise between units is one of my only complaints. There appears to be no sound insulation between units. Our bedroom abuts the neighbor's living room. Thankfully, we don't have a rowdy neighbor, but when they're watching KU basketball or Real Housewives, it's like we're in the room with them watching it too. It's an issue to think about, but it hasn't been a deal breaker for us.   There are two 'Lucas Place-provided' parking options available: the lot adjacent to the building for around $75/month and the larger lot a little farther away for around $65/month. I did a little research, and found that the big parking garage just behind the apartment building is for DST employees, but they're all too happy to rent it out to residents if you go to the parking company (Lucas Place probably won't mention this option). It runs $85/month for a covered garage space, and is worth it in my opinion. The garage gets really full during the weekdays with DST employees, but it clears out after business hours, so I never have a problem parking when I get home from work.   Overall, I'm really happy with the building and the location. We'll probably stick around until we either get a house or they jack our rent up a bunch."

What are your recommendations & thoughts  on parking? I have to call KCPL and get the average electricity rates, but for you, how have they fared? I used to live on 10th and they had shitty windows. Needless to say winter electricity bill sucked. There is no Google Fiber in the building, how has ATT compared for you? The walls seemed much thicker compared to other lofts I lived in, am I correct in that? I am used to noise in an apartment building, it'll happen. But was curious if it was different for Lucas Lofts?

Our summer bills are around $100/month, and the winter bill might creep to the mid $150s. Granted, we're in a corner unit with a LOT of windows, so your experience might be different.  Not having google fiber sucks. But AT&T uverse is a tolerable alternative. I've not had any major issues, but then again I'm not on their fastest plan, so I don't have any room to complain when it's not blazing fast.  See wall answer, above.  There's lots of amenities (community room, theatre room, gym). I've never used any of these, but they're nice to have? The one thing I wish was offered is an outdoor grilling area. The leasing office hours are kind of a pain if you ever need to go there in person for anything. But if you get a package, Wanda's usually happy to run it up to the apartment for you. The location is great! It's so close to a lot of fun places. All maintenance issues have been sorted out very quickly. As you can imagine with a newer build, there have been numerous requests.    Let me know if you have any more questions.   I wish that I've met more people in the building, but haven't really done so. If you decide to pull the trigger, send me a message. It would be nice to meet more people in the building!"
kansascity,3dxnlw,HNIRobertPaulson,2,Mon Jul 20 13:55:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks, application is going in today. And I'm looking at an unit on the 7th. It has one arch window, and it's a corner unit from what I recall, but regular window on one wall."

kansascity,3dxnlw,letters-to-myself,-6,Tue Jul 21 17:06:34 2015 UTC,"Lofts are fine and nice and secure and sterile.  My suggestion is that if you are going to live in the city you get much more value moving into a restored 6-plex or 4-plex or a duplex in brookside or waldo or even, gasp, Valentine/Hyde Park (may be too scary/cracky/gay for ya).  Once you start edging north of 1k a month for an apartment you might as well just buy one of many california split levels in one of many suburbs out here as a starter home and pay less in mortgage than you would for rent.  These lofts are marketed at two groups:  1) students and people making less than ~35k a year who get subsidies on their rent.  2) Out of towners mostly from the east coast who jump at the chance to have a 1000 sqft loft with exposed brick for 1200 a month and do not realize they are overpaying.  River market, downtown loop and crossroads is quite the concrete jungle.  You don't get a lot of grassland there.  Eventually it gets to you."
kansascity,3dxnlw,yousmelllikearainbow,3,Mon Jul 20 19:51:18 2015 UTC,"Already looked at Hyde Park. Anything in the $700 to $900 range that I had looked was really bad. Some places even considered 8ft x 9ft a bedroom. You'd have to challenge yourself to fit in a queen.  I work in the crossroads and prior in 2013 lived downtown. To me this appeals, yeah no backyard. But that's my choice. I can walk in the fall and take the tramm when it's up and running.   I'm not looking to commute, and river market doesn't have much affordability either.   Lastly I'm not ready to commit to a house as i don't know if I'll stick around."

kansascity,3dwdlv,RedTuxedo,20,Mon Jul 20 02:15:12 2015 UTC,"I commute from midtown to JoCo daily on a bicycle, year-round. I've been doing so for almost two years now, so I can offer a bit of my experience. It's not as terrible as some people will try to convince you, but we're still far behind a truly bike-oriented urban core.  The good news is, pretty much everybody is friendly and kind. I ran into very few a**holes during my rides. Most issues I've had were related to inattentive drivers. So be careful and be safe and you'll be fine. You'd be surprised with how many people ride their bikes on a daily basis, especially around midtown.  Some routes are really easy to navigate, with signs like this. You'll find them mainly from downtown to the Crossroads and from Westport to Waldo, west of Wornall. Make sure you wear some lights after dusk, abide to traffic laws and most importantly have fun!  Also, shoot me a PM if you have any specific question."
kansascity,3dwdlv,alleycatbiker,10,Mon Jul 20 02:33:32 2015 UTC,"We should organize a weekly or monthly ride for newcomers in midtown, and plot a course to demonstrate the ease of getting certain places and also how to ride in a predictable, safe, and visible manner."

If you look up ""KCMBC clinic ride"", there are some dates on which the guys teach the basics. There's also http://bikewalkkc.org/. I don't know much about their advocacy. I know the owner of my favorite bike shop is involved."
kansascity,3dwdlv,alleycatbiker,8,Mon Jul 20 14:12:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for this! I probably will PM you in the future. I'll want some more deets!
kansascity,3dwdlv,damacu,8,Mon Jul 20 02:35:25 2015 UTC,"Also glad to hear it's not as bad as people say it is, because I have heard it's bad a time or two. Maybe all it will take to make it more bikeable is more bicyclists!"
kansascity,3dwdlv,LegitLlama,2,Mon Jul 20 02:36:06 2015 UTC,PM me for an after-work ride some day this week.  Stop for a beer afterward.  I'll show you some nifty routes around Westport if you've got the time and the legs.
kansascity,3dwdlv,alleycatbiker,8,Mon Jul 20 17:51:06 2015 UTC,Google maps does have an option for a bike route which is helpful.
kansascity,3dwdlv,LegitLlama,3,Mon Jul 20 07:28:26 2015 UTC,"It does indeed, but sometimes it can be sketchy, in the sense of sending you to routes officially marked as ""Bike route"" but not as friendly as a parallel street. Like Ward Parkway (some southern parts of it have the Bike Route sign) or Merriam Lane.  I'd strongly recommend Strava heatmap as a counterpart to Google Maps. Don't trust blindly either of them, but let them work together."
kansascity,3dwdlv,davegsomething,2,Mon Jul 20 14:16:34 2015 UTC,Yeah wish they had an option for bike lane like they do for hov lane.

kansascity,3dwdlv,alleycatbiker,4,Mon Jul 20 03:47:40 2015 UTC,I've been commuting from downtown to those areas fairly regularly for the last year. There are so many different route variations. Instead of posting multiple screenshots you can PM me your email address and we can link up on Strava so you can get a better look at routes.
kansascity,3dwdlv,damacu,2,Mon Jul 20 05:15:38 2015 UTC,Solid! On it.
kansascity,3dwdlv,Philo_T_Farnsworth,3,Mon Jul 20 06:00:48 2015 UTC,"Basically, from Waldo going North you want to reach Westport. From there, I usually take Pennsylvania all the way to 31st St, then Main or Grand all the way to 3rd St. Main has the Bus Lane (which will almost always be an exclusive lane for you). Grand is a bit wider and a good option to avoid the trolley construction areas.  Another option is to take Paseo all the way to 11th."
kansascity,3dwdlv,alleycatbiker,3,Mon Jul 20 14:19:33 2015 UTC,"Are you purposely not disclosing the WestSide route so you can hog it all to yourself?  Seriously, Pennsylvania N. to Penn Valley Park (Penn Drive) to Summit to West Pennway to Beardsely to 5th Street.  Stay West with the best."

It helps a lot if you actually enjoy doing it, which thankfully is my case. Sometimes I go hard, most of the time I ride at an easy pace. With no major hills except the climb from the Plaza to Loose Park."
kansascity,3dwdlv,damacu,7,Mon Jul 20 14:03:52 2015 UTC,"I've only ridden bikes in KCMO for fun on the weekends, so I can't speak to how it is to ride every day.  The main observation I have is that the pavement quality is ""OK, but not great""; if you have one of those bikes made from carbon fiber and unicorn spit, with 0.5"" wide tires, you might want to get something a little stronger for the daily grind.  MARC is the regional planning agency; they have an online map of bike routes, both on-street and separate.  One organization that advocates for biking in KC is BikeWalkKC (whose website seems to be down at the moment).  They are somehow affiliated with the Kansas City branch of B-cycle bike rental.  I am not affiliated with any of the organizations above."

I take Gillham in the morning and mainstreet back up. Only have had one issue in a guy in his mercedes who thinks passing on the left is too hard of a task. Honestly, if you know your mains roads north and south, biking is no issue. Roads east to west are always safe to ride. Just the north to south roads you have to be a bit weary on.

kansascity,3dwdlv,damacu,9,Mon Jul 20 05:12:57 2015 UTC,I'm not even a cyclist but I hear people make a way bigger deal out of the cyclist they saw last week not obeying every traffic law than the half a hundred cars I see every day doing the same thing.
kansascity,3dwdlv,lownote,5,Mon Jul 20 12:05:27 2015 UTC,lol that duck though
kansascity,3dwdlv,damacu,3,Mon Jul 20 06:00:18 2015 UTC,If your going to run every light you shouldnt be on the road.
kansascity,3dwdlv,LegitLlama,4,Mon Jul 20 07:29:39 2015 UTC,in many states this is legal on a bike because stopping needlessly at a light or sign impedes momentum and therefore impedes cars behind you.
kansascity,3dwdlv,LegitLlama,4,Mon Jul 20 15:40:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, the ""Idaho Stop"" and ""Dead on Red,"" to be precise.  MO only has the stoplight one, which is shared equally with motorcycles.  The specifics are a bit vague, and ultimately up to the discretion of the officer deciding to issue a ticket or not.    Ideally, you'd come to a full stop at a light and then proceed once you've determined that your weight will not trigger the light change.  This is where it's vague and very hard to enforce.  Basically, you (as the cyclist) have to believe that you are at an intersection that is triggered only by sensors, and you also have to be certain that sitting still at the intersection imperils you (which statistically it does).  After you've made sure that traffic is clear, you can proceed on the red light.  This is complicated further by the way certain intersections honor traffic flow based on vehicle placement.  For instance, you could be on your bike, and nobody behind you or in an adjacent lane going in your same direction.  However, the left turn lane could be occupied in both directions, and therefore only illuminate the green turn arrows and completely bypass the non-turning traffic.  If given a ticket on a bike in these scenarios in MO, you'd just need to appeal to the judge with your findings about that intersection and the circumstances why it puts you at serious risk of injury to sit there.  The Idaho Stop is pretty awesome and needs to be expanded, legally.  On a bike, you have three incredible advantages to being aware of traffic in all directions when compared to automobile travel.  Your ears (red-shift/blue-shift), your wider line of sight (full periphery), and your slower relative speed (rapid stopping ability).  However, even with the Idaho Stop, all stop signs should be treated as yield signs, so don't just blast through them like a hellion (which, fortunately, I witness most cyclists use caution when doing this)."

kansascity,3dwdlv,twosmalldeaths,2,Mon Jul 20 22:58:46 2015 UTC,"I'm very familiar with the code and thank you for posting the link, but the language is vague and errs on the side of the cyclist.  I could approach a light, do a track stand, say it has been an unreasonable amount of time, believe that it won't trigger me or believe it to be malfunctioning, see a nice break in cross traffic and continue on my way.  Words like unreasonable and apparently ensure that the law is vague and favor the cyclist.  Pretty cool, in my opinion."
kansascity,3dwdlv,portugalthephilosoph,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:11:27 2015 UTC,I know in Va the rule is you must treat lights like a stop sign (had a motorcycle). They passed that law for motorcyclist though not really bicyclists.
kansascity,3dwdlv,twosmalldeaths,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:48:22 2015 UTC,Well i know in Missouri it is currently illegal not sure about Kansas
kansascity,3dwdlv,portugalthephilosoph,-3,Mon Jul 20 19:44:21 2015 UTC,"My biggest frustration is when they ride on a busy road, not anywhere near the speed limit for cars, with an empty sidewalk right next to them. It causes serious traffic issues and is not safe for the bike rider...   I drive south on Gillham every evening, and there is always someone on a bike at 22nd and Gillham, which is a terrible place for a bike to be blocking lanes of traffic. There's an empty sidewalk that no one is ever walking on, I just don't understand why it can't be used for biking."
kansascity,3dwdlv,twosmalldeaths,7,Mon Jul 20 14:44:53 2015 UTC,sidewalks are terribly dangerous to ride on due to damage and the fact that cars aren't looking for someone going 20 MPH on the road between sidewalks. it's also illegal in business districts.
kansascity,3dwdlv,portugalthephilosoph,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:40:54 2015 UTC,"Well, the sidewalks in that area are in great shape, and much safer than riding 20 mph slower than traffic in the driving lane."
kansascity,3dwdlv,twosmalldeaths,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:04 2015 UTC,It's not. Turning cars and cars who don't stop before the line will kill you.
kansascity,3dwdlv,portugalthephilosoph,0,Mon Jul 20 16:06:32 2015 UTC,"Riding in the fucking driving lane will kill you much easier... Especially when you're going 20 mph slower than the cars that weigh a couple tons more than you, and when you don't deign to stop at red lights or stop signs ""because those are only for cars""."
