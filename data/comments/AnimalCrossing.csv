AnimalCrossing,3e2arj,ChineseEyes,50,Tue Jul 21 13:40:48 2015 UTC,"In Britain, ""bell-end"" is something you might call someone you don't like. Its a reference to a certain part of the male anatomy. Lol"
AnimalCrossing,3e2arj,Lt_Bucky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:57:08 2015 UTC,"Huh, I always thought it was in reference to bell curves, like someone who was a ""bell-end"" would be at the left end of the bell curve, and since those are used for test scores and IQs and stuff it's like calling them stupid.

AnimalCrossing,3e2arj,Bocconcini,3,Tue Jul 21 18:19:32 2015 UTC,According to my friends that doesn't work.  And I think it's true.  I was beating the shit out of Nana with my net and reporting her to Isabelle like crazy. a character i mildly like but never 'talk to' left before she did.  She ended up leaving when I quit beating her and instead just ignored the hell out of her.  Now if I can just get Chow and Charlise to leave. Ugh.

AnimalCrossing,3e26zb,DenseReals,4,Tue Jul 21 11:36:59 2015 UTC,"The art is so adorable. Do the amiibo add anything to the game or do they simply let you choose which content to access?

AnimalCrossing,3e26zb,carpark72,2,Tue Jul 21 13:47:18 2015 UTC,"It seems that scanning an amiibo card has that villager/character arrive to ask you to design their home. You can also use them to have them appear in a home that you're in. So the cards just seem to be a way to ""invite"" a character in your game that you like, and that seems to be all the cards do as far as we know."
AnimalCrossing,3e26zb,DenseReals,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:02:54 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks. If the game is complete without amiibo (which appears to be the case) then I'll have to seriously consider buying it!"

AnimalCrossing,3e2i1i,Platypusquack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:36 2015 UTC,Reviews are still incredibly meaningful. They let you know if a person with a similar taste in games found it to be enjoyable or not. They letyou know about performance issues beforehand and can give you a deeper understanding of the title.   Review scores are the useless part. The number is entirely arbitrary and don't add anything of value to the writing other than meeting a metacritic criteria.

AnimalCrossing,3e1i37,dangochan808,12,Tue Jul 21 06:05:16 2015 UTC,Some villagers come with rare unorderable furniture that can be expensive to replace and even if you sent it to them they may not use it.  Same goes for their original outfit.  Some people want original villagers so that they can try to get the furniture they have in their house.

AnimalCrossing,3e1i37,redbowkiki,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:36:15 2015 UTC,"Some people don't like it when their villagers talk about their old towns. The main reason I believe is that it replaces another (more interesting/ useful) conversation that they would've had if they hadn't said that. Same with them humming their old town tune (I traded some villagers from cycle towns so it doesn't really bother me since it's just the stock tune). Also I guess there's a possessiveness. Like, you're in my town, stop talking about your old one.  Also sometimes their old towns have really stupid town names like ""Butt"" or ""U smell"" or ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" if you get them from street pass. Having said that, I got Rowan from street pass and he came from Sunnyville, which I thought was cute. :)"

Also, you could go onto forums or even just some AC related subreddits and find friend codes so you can visit other people's towns to see how amazing they can be. And then it may just motivate you to make a beautiful town full of paths, hybrids and PWPs.   Don't get stressed over Animal Crossing. It's the complete opposite of what it's main purpose is."

AnimalCrossing,3e3sz1,Remarkable_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:16 2015 UTC,Yes you can. As long as you don't let your game to the next day or previous day. He'll still be in your town.   You should probably just make a note of when his MO day it and don't play your game after that day until you get someone to adopt him.

AnimalCrossing,3e03b3,Kigurumix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:17:29 2015 UTC,"I always have my suspicions about the breakdown of the userbase when I make changes or add to the CSS.   The difference in screen sizes can change the usability for smaller screens, depending on the changes made (usually sidebar or hovering images).  If a user uses an app, they don't see any of the changes, and that may lead to them missing important news/notifications, or convenient ease-of-use changes for sub readers.  Also, an app will most likely display sidebars with CSS ""off"", which can make sidebars extremely garbage-looking (sports subs are bad for this).  I had just never really made a poll about it before, was bored."
AnimalCrossing,3e03b3,Kigurumix,2,Tue Jul 21 00:22:28 2015 UTC,"Cool, it is nice to take the user base into consideration.  Wished I could have chosen two options though because I use two different methods for reading reddit."
AnimalCrossing,3e18zx,Ryoshi217,6,Tue Jul 21 04:30:10 2015 UTC,You will not be able to invite a camper to move in unless you have nine or fewer villagers in your town.
AnimalCrossing,3e18zx,Kigurumix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:33:36 2015 UTC,The camper will not move in. You can only have a max of ten villagers.

AnimalCrossing,3e17z9,minicucumbers,2,Tue Jul 21 04:20:01 2015 UTC,"If you're happy with the rest of your game, why not just accept it the same way you would accept tiny imperfections in the real world? When you buy a house, unless you build it yourself, you don't choose exactly where it's placed on the property. But you can do things to make it aesthetically pleasing. Plant a garden on one side of the house to make it feel more balanced and ""centered"" under the lake. Put down some PWPs, like a well or something pretty. Build around it so that the house is just one part of your whole property. If you post a pic, I bet people would be happy to give you suggestions!"
AnimalCrossing,3e17z9,TabbyCaterpillar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:39:14 2015 UTC,Yeah you can't really move your house location which sucks tbh. I used to have a decent house location until villagers started building their houses next to mine.
AnimalCrossing,3e17z9,90sLover2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:27 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately you'll only be able to move house locations in Happy Home Designer, sorry! D: it sucks that we've had to wait this long for this option but its nice that Nintendo did think of it this time."

AnimalCrossing,3dyjb8,DrTitanium,7,Mon Jul 20 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"When I was a kid, I lived a really lonely lifestyle. I didn't really have friends at school to hang out with, and I actually got bullied a lot too. Growing up, my GameCube was really my best friend. I played a bunch of games on it that also ended up becoming favorites for me, like Melee, Paper Mario, Pokèmon XD, etc. One of the games I eventually picked up was Animal Crossing, and that game practically made me the person I am today. I loved the seemingly endless experiences the game offered me, and I could really relate to the game since I always felt like I was living by myself in the real world too. I have countless memories of the game... Having Resetti ""reset"" my console, trying to learn how to mash the A button fast enough to clean Gracie's car, even just standing in my house's quiet atmosphere. I eventually overcame most of my problems, but by no means would it have been possible without Animal Crossing. I honestly believe that without Animal Crossing, I might not even physically be here today."
AnimalCrossing,3dyjb8,AwkwardPSI,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:59 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad you discovered it then! I hope you're in a better place now. I completely forgot about Gracie's car! Ha, my thumb twitched when I remembered mashing that green A. Your experience also raises the question of what it was like then and what it would be like now with all the online capabilities. Do you think AC is even better now for younger people who might be having a similar experience? Do you still play? Again, I'm really glad you found it."
AnimalCrossing,3dyjb8,AwkwardPSI,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for reading it. While I grew up with the original game, I believe any of the games can provide a similar experience to mine (except Amiibo Festival, ugh). I think that the ways in which the series has been evolving can help others in situations like mine, maybe even better due to the online. With the online, it also encourages others to play with their friends in Animal Crossing, which can help build friendships and relationships between people that both play Animal Crossing for fun or that play the games for something more meaningful. I always encourage playing Animal Crossing to anyone I know, and I definitely hope younger people are playing it and getting something great from it as well! I've played the entire Animal Crossing series ever since, and I've just started another town again on New Leaf. Definitely a fun and influential series to me!"
AnimalCrossing,3dyjb8,swiftieatheart,2,Mon Jul 20 16:39:01 2015 UTC,"Of course I'd read it. You've a really nice way of describing your experience. Amiibo Festival looks horrific, I really don't even want to consider it a part of the experience. It'd be one thing if it was a feature of a proper game, a one time event or something but an entire game... disastrous."
AnimalCrossing,3dyjb8,KymPerson,5,Mon Jul 20 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"I just got my first Animal Crossing this past Christmas and I have fallen in love!  To answer your question, I would say it has provided a sense of calmness in my life and opened a new community. I got it over Christmas break from college and since then not a day has passed that I don't play. I would be stressed about school or friends but ACNL always provided a way for me to relax and talk to the villagers who (at least in my head) will always care about me :).  It had also opened me to the lovely community of AC lovers on reddit! I have gotten to partake in so many discussion and even trade rare items I had no idea existed. And now I just love giving back to other because of how much the community has taken care of me.  So, yes I would say getting Animal Crossing had benefitted me. A LOT! :)"
AnimalCrossing,3dyjb8,cweesta,5,Mon Jul 20 17:07:27 2015 UTC,"I've played since Wild World, and what Animal Crossing has given me is an escape. I have Asperger's and social anxiety, but when I open my 3DS, and a villager asks me for a new public works project, or a new hybrid flower appears, or I get a letter, I can't help but smile. These pixel animals make me happy."
AnimalCrossing,3dyjb8,InfernityFist,3,Mon Jul 20 21:25:13 2015 UTC,"It's a game that I can pick up whenever without stressing about remembering what I was doing or where I left off. Mostly, I've learned tidbits about bugs and fish and I'm always impressed with myself when I remember the animal crossing facts when I'm doing something in nature."
AnimalCrossing,3dz1rx,TabbyCaterpillar,2,Mon Jul 20 18:13:03 2015 UTC,Basically. Even more so if you have the bell boom ordinance.

AnimalCrossing,3dz1rx,MissMari,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:28:07 2015 UTC,Or 6 am. If you're not against time traveling. Even so. Some beetles can be caught still at 6am
AnimalCrossing,3dz1rx,stitchmaker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:07 2015 UTC,"Premium bugs should be on the board outside of retail.  Golden Stags and goliath beetles have been on mine.  Got 333k for a pocket of mostly golden stags and a few other bugs.  Do you have your island set up right or is it still the way it was?  Removing all the shrubs, flowers and leaving only one tree in the middle helps.  I have only 3 palm trees on each side of the hut.  The palm trees got removed.  The basket is full in a short period of time.   7pm is a good time but found out early morning is good too.  The giant stags, rainbow stags and other palm trees bugs show up on the trees.  Basket got full in a very short period of time.  You could start growing some perfect fruit in safe spots.  Wait for premium in another person town to sell them.  A locker, pockets and letters gets you 11 million bells.  Do you have a lot of flowers?  Before you put it on bell bloom you might want to store the hybrids if you can't water them."
AnimalCrossing,3dz1rx,stitchmaker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I do have it set up to maximize bugs. No flowers or shrubs, and no trees in the middle. Just palm trees around the left and right side. So I walk down the middle and slowly walk up the left side, looking for bugs and sharks, then go back down the middle and go to the right side, same thing, repeat. That way I can see if there are any bugs on any of the trees and I don't end up scaring them away.  I could also do the perfect fruit thing. My town is mostly perfect apple trees, with a small orchard of other fruit and some regular trees throughout. Is there a place where people post when they have perfect fruit on premium?"

AnimalCrossing,3dz8el,elluor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:02:25 2015 UTC,"I could, that is true.    How fast does your village fill up, usually? And, if I was careful about it, I could just write down my last save date, and always set my clock back to that so I never lose a guy, too, right?    And if my save data is wiped, does that mean my queue is wiped, too, and I can get the old guys I had before again?"
AnimalCrossing,3dz8el,elluor,2,Mon Jul 20 19:07:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how fast it fills up because I've had my town since 2013. And yes, I think you could do that but I've never done it. I have seen others do it. There's a certain process and yes I think that would be true.   But, what I meant is you just keep resetting the town, which would fix the map problem you said to the other person. Don't like any of the 3 maps? Force close the game with the power button and restart! Don't like the villagers? Do the same. Don't want square grass and that's what the town is? Force restart."

You can time travel to try and speed up the process but it could take a while. I've been trying to get Kid Cat to move for about 10 (in game) months but he's refused to budge. I think I've spent something like 6 hours time traveling :(
AnimalCrossing,3dy33s,Korsola,2,Mon Jul 20 14:08:16 2015 UTC,"Animals are more likely to move out, the friendlier you are with them.  So send him a letter with a present every day and do odd favours for him. I wanted to be besties with Jacques so I sent him letters constantly and did frequent favours, after a week he wanted to move out two days in a row >_<"
AnimalCrossing,3dy33s,Dartpaw86,2,Mon Jul 20 15:07:22 2015 UTC,I think the move out process is random. I've had friendly villagers never ask to move and villagers I've literally never talked to only live in my town for a week.
AnimalCrossing,3dy33s,Korsola,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:01:53 2015 UTC,"Probably so, but I have heard what I said from various sources, saying that Nintendo did that on purpose to make it harder to get pictures. But who really knows? They could just be rumours."

I would try talking to them once, then ignoring them for a week. After that, they should ping you to move out. If that doesn't work, villagers ask to move out at random, BUT they are more likely to actually move out if you are better friends. If you are not close, they will more likely change their minds and choose to stay to ""become better friends"" (I've had a villager say that to me previously). You can TT to try and get someone to ping you faster."

AnimalCrossing,3dx3lm,metadatamosh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:55:18 2015 UTC,This. Also give rare furniture in person or by letters according to their preferences (like Ken the chicken prefers harmonious). Catch the rarest fish and bugs when they ask as well. Be their hero!!

I always give non native perfect fruit, rare fish like sharks, refurbished furniture, etc. Try not to forget to visit their homes and bury their time capsules. Letter writing may also help?  I've never been exceptionally nice to Penelope and I want her gone so badly tbh but she gave me her picture when I brought her a whale shark today.

AnimalCrossing,3dv9y9,GermBurgers,5,Sun Jul 19 20:30:51 2015 UTC,"I think my addiction has much to do with the sense of progression in the game.  In The Sims you have everything since the beginning. I get very excited when I start playing, but I soon lose my hype. ACNL, on other hand, has such a slow pace that I keep playing it everyday. So I dunno, maybe it's because you've played it so much that there's almost nothing left to achieve.  I kinda fear that in one or two years I'll lose interest on the game too, after dedicating so much time to it :C"
AnimalCrossing,3dv9y9,yumemiguy,4,Sun Jul 19 20:59:04 2015 UTC,"I've always known my town would be abandoned one day, its inevitable. Playing new leaf has had such a possitive impact on my life though, every second was worth it."
AnimalCrossing,3dv9y9,DrTitanium,2,Sun Jul 19 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"That's really interesting. I'm a longtime AC fan (played GC way back when, then WW and now I'm on NL having started around the New Year). In what ways has it had a positive impact on your life?"
AnimalCrossing,3dv9y9,yumemiguy,5,Sun Jul 19 22:11:05 2015 UTC,"Its very relaxing and allows for creativity. Its a constant source of positivity. Its consistent, you know what to expect, which cant be always be said for real life. Its a communication tool for far off friends. So many reasons. Overall though, its the comfort of having control over something. Life can get you down, but if you embrace this game you will always have  happy place."
AnimalCrossing,3dv9y9,yumemiguy,2,Sun Jul 19 22:37:10 2015 UTC,"Now that you say that, I feel it has a nice impact on me too. I'm a fashion design student, but honestly I'm a big procrastinator, and I have heavy anxiety. Because I'm a procrastinator I create much less than I want to, and it only makes me feel more anxious.  While playing Animal Crossing I'm definitely able to create more easily, be it making patterns or just thinking of ways of designing my town and my home. It's not something that gives me money or has any practical application, but it helps me exercising my creativity and setting me on a mood to create more stuff (not to mention that I'm practicing pixel art, something that I never learned on university).  So yeah, I understand why you say that, even if you abandon it someday, the game is worth playing."
AnimalCrossing,3dv9y9,Dartpaw86,2,Mon Jul 20 04:28:56 2015 UTC,"That's nice to hear :)  When I played it on GameCube I was half the age I am now, and it was just an addiction of fun. But this one has definitely been a relaxation tool. Its just niceness! If they ever do a Wii U one I'll start playing a lot again, and I'll give HHD a go too. I don't think I'll ever play like this again though, almost 1000hours over two years... Insane."
AnimalCrossing,3dv9y9,yumemiguy,2,Mon Jul 20 10:56:55 2015 UTC,"IMHO even the community is relaxing. I'm so used to seeing abrasive people in gaming communities. It's such a nice change to see so many nice people trying to help each other. And it isn't even just here on reddit, I've seen this behavior on ACNL communities on tumblr and facebook too"
AnimalCrossing,3dv9y9,Dartpaw86,3,Mon Jul 20 16:52:45 2015 UTC,"My problem with The Sims, is that getting enough money to buy awesome stuff and a kickass giant mansion is heavily satisfying and worth the long long wait of playing. Except... I never got that far before I get impatient and say ""Screw it"" using the money cheat.   With Animal Crossing, there is no such cheat. You are forced to play it slow and get money the slow way, thus you feel satisfied. Even with the Island, it's still an annoying grind to get all the money you want."
AnimalCrossing,3dv9y9,joshuralize,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:03:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't even remember when was the last time I played The Sims without using cheats.  It felt the opposite for me. In ACNL the process is actually entertaining, and the slow pace never gets boring to me. In The Sims the process of getting money is more like a chore. Not that The Sims is bad though, specially since there is so much interaction with the objects."

AnimalCrossing,3dscqo,unrelevant_user_name,2,Sun Jul 19 04:29:40 2015 UTC,Where do they even get food.... Well I guess they fish and berry pick but where do they get all the other food they mention.... there aint exactly a wallyworld in AC
AnimalCrossing,3dscqo,Zytraxian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"Fish, fruit, berries, bugs(?), or rice (the latter from the rice rack PWP). I'm more curious about hygiene. In the river and/or ocean? Or do they just all have entire bathrooms inside their closets they pull out as necessary?"
AnimalCrossing,3dscqo,unrelevant_user_name,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:58:17 2015 UTC,Some of them have bathtubs too...
AnimalCrossing,3dscqo,Zytraxian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:04:44 2015 UTC,I've seen pictures of villagers sitting on their toilet.  Villager will talk about using the whirlpool.   My main town has a bathroom/ spa in the museum for the town to use.

AnimalCrossing,3dr4z2,-mephisto,2,Sun Jul 19 02:26:28 2015 UTC,Thanks! For about a year and a half now
AnimalCrossing,3dr4z2,matzimazing,2,Sun Jul 19 02:34:51 2015 UTC,Neat!  You should look around Toys r us; World of Nintendo has a brand new Rover plushie that would fit perfectly in that collection.

The green villager plush with the shovel I have only seen on ebay twice in two years, and I own one of them. Also, the poster I have on the wall I have only seen one time in two years. So it's definitely kinda luck-based when it comes to getting cool stuff. Thanks for looking !"

AnimalCrossing,3dr4z2,7536982145,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:14 2015 UTC,"The first one is my favorite simply because I grew up playing it. The graphics and art style of the gamecube one are also pretty dope. New leaf is a pretty solid game too, and if I didn't grow up playing the first one, new leaf would probably be my favorite."
AnimalCrossing,3dr4z2,7536982145,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:02:44 2015 UTC,"Nice, is your favorite also the one you play the most? I just got the Gamecube Animal Crossing again and I'm stoked to start playing it. Revisit my childhood, chill with all of the non-toned down grumpy villagers."
AnimalCrossing,3drzm0,xkingxdreadx,4,Sat Jul 18 22:02:09 2015 UTC,Lol irl at the 2 villagers in the corners. Who are they?
AnimalCrossing,3drzm0,jellyyy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:22:02 2015 UTC,One in the top left is Winnie and top right is Diana
AnimalCrossing,3drzm0,sigyn13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:47 2015 UTC,Wow I didn't think a villager would move all the way in the left corner like that!
AnimalCrossing,3drzm0,DrTitanium,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:58:52 2015 UTC,Interesting layout! I like the little headland/island-like feel in the middle.

AnimalCrossing,3ds2j8,Dartpaw86,4,Sat Jul 18 22:29:06 2015 UTC,If you've got space you should put a bench or tree stump there for them to sit on. If it's a high traffic area you'll probably find them sitting there all the time (:
AnimalCrossing,3ds2j8,erinhasguts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:20:07 2015 UTC,Thanks :3
AnimalCrossing,3ds2j8,erinhasguts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:47:42 2015 UTC,Here we go :3
AnimalCrossing,3ds2j8,RestlessChaos,2,Sun Jul 19 11:07:49 2015 UTC,Hopefully you'll catch someone sitting there soon. It's really adorable when you catch two villagers sitting there.
AnimalCrossing,3drxad,moocow_101,7,Sat Jul 18 21:41:13 2015 UTC,Some key points:   No night/day cycle and you choose when to end the work day. You can assign villagers to specific roles in the public facilities you design. No consequences for designing homes that don't fit the villager's requested themes. No need to budget the costs of decorating a home. Doesn't seem like you can design custom clothing for villagers.
AnimalCrossing,3drxad,imrail,2,Sat Jul 18 21:51:27 2015 UTC,"It sounds very promising, albeit at bit restricting in what we can do. Luckily there isn't any pressure behind it if you missed a day playing the game.  Sadly nothing about designing our own house (yes we can do that in NL, but not with the freedom of HHD).  Custom furniture (if I interpreted it the correct way) is in the game which is a huge deal for me."
AnimalCrossing,3drxad,abunnyleaps,2,Sun Jul 19 12:20:04 2015 UTC,"But can you walk around the town? Or do you just warp to homes? EDIT: To clarify, I don't mean the plaza with the amenities like School, Hospital, etc. I mean the map."
AnimalCrossing,3drxad,abunnyleaps,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:42:55 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling that you won't be able to walk from house to house. I'm curious if the villagers still move out though. Otherwise, you'd end up with a very crowded town."
AnimalCrossing,3drxad,erinhasguts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:09:36 2015 UTC,Ugh. I really want this to be Animal Crossing and not Animal Teleporting.
AnimalCrossing,3drxad,abunnyleaps,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:41:24 2015 UTC,They've shown a little car in some of the trailers.
AnimalCrossing,3drxad,foreversenpai,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"And now I'm depressed. It's going to be Animal Teleporting. With small segments of the town to see, not the entirety."

AnimalCrossing,3drxad,janlancer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:42:07 2015 UTC,"It's such a strange directional choice. I wouldn't be surprised if they're developing AC as a launch title for the NX project, they're developing the ""conventional"" AC features for it and are testing the waters with this one to add its features. I'm not really excited for it at all, it isn't what I really want from Animal Crossing. It's a shame. NL might be my last."

AnimalCrossing,3dskyk,sipro25,4,Sun Jul 19 01:29:13 2015 UTC,"Well one reason to visit her often (once she moves to main street) is that you can get two special items from her. If you go in there on a day you have bad luck, she'll offer to sell you either a tingle hood or a celebration hat. Both of these items give you good luck or cancel out your bad luck every day so you can just wear on of them instead of the lucky  item of the day :) Edit: here is a link to the different kinds of luck you can have each day   http://www.thonky.com/animal-crossing-new-leaf/why-tripping-luck"
AnimalCrossing,3dskyk,HypotheticalTruth,3,Sun Jul 19 13:23:24 2015 UTC,"Yup, just got it a few days ago and I'm hooked. Trying to get money luck to get more out of the trees and bell rock. Plus her predictions are pretty funny at times."
AnimalCrossing,3dskyk,Winter-Stardust,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:05:55 2015 UTC,Interesting. How's the difference with trees and bell rocks?
AnimalCrossing,3dskyk,Winter-Stardust,3,Sun Jul 19 02:39:04 2015 UTC,"Pretty good, some days trees give 200 bells instead of 100, rock values are doubled, etc."
AnimalCrossing,3dskyk,Platypusquack,2,Sun Jul 19 03:22:10 2015 UTC,"I always visited her to get my shop. Now that I have it, I still visit her, but for not real reason. It's just a part of my daily routine. It just feels complete to do that, haha."
AnimalCrossing,3dskyk,DenseReals,2,Sun Jul 19 01:34:13 2015 UTC,Still a long way to go until I get her shop in my current town buuuut I've always liked the love and friendship lucks (it seems like villagers give me more/better gifts). And the money luck is nice for the bell rock.
AnimalCrossing,3dskyk,moocow_101,2,Sun Jul 19 03:19:31 2015 UTC,I've been playing the game since release and still haven't gotten her to set up shop. I didn't even know that was possible until last year.
AnimalCrossing,3dskyk,clonetrooper250,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:49:31 2015 UTC,"I visited her shop every opportunity I had, just so I could finish main street (her shop was the last one I needed). Since her new store has been built, I haven't been in to see her at all."
AnimalCrossing,3dskyk,Bragior,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:31:51 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to have her shop, but visiting her 20 times will take a long time, I mean, especially because I only have one character and I don't have the space for others. I also have the bad habit of missing her visits.   You can visit other towns with Katrina, though, even if they're on the main street. It adds to the number of needed visits for her to open up a shop in your main street."
AnimalCrossing,3dskyk,turuleka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:37:08 2015 UTC,My main reason for getting her was so I could her store and then get a Tingle Hat. After getting the hat I've noticed that villagers ping me a lot more often and I get better item drops from trees and as gifts.
AnimalCrossing,3ds2u8,PeachyEl,2,Sat Jul 18 22:31:45 2015 UTC,"The Saturday before my birthday, he didn't give me an option to request anything at first, he just told me he had a special song for me and then played it.  Afterwards, I was able to request other songs.  Your game's Date is the same?  And your character's birthday is the same?  If so, then perhaps its a game glitch."
AnimalCrossing,3ds2u8,beilfre,3,Sat Jul 18 22:48:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah everythings the same, he had me pick out songs and after the 2nd or 3rd I tried to request the birthday song and he was just like that's for special occasions only . darnn must be a glitch :/ Thanks !"
AnimalCrossing,3ds2u8,beilfre,3,Sat Jul 18 23:01:13 2015 UTC,"If you really want the song, you could try over at /r/ACTrade, all the songs are orderable.

AnimalCrossing,3dsct2,DrTitanium,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, separate memory cards.  I've tried it yesterday. I haven't checked if my newly planted saplings have grown, but the telltale sign would be that if they stay a sapling, that means it counts as time traveling (as going back in time stunts growth)."
AnimalCrossing,3dsct2,DrTitanium,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:42:35 2015 UTC,"Have you ever played AC before? How are you finding the ""step back"" to GC? The NES games were such a fantastic feature of that version... and saving/making major Bells really felt like a massive achievement on it"
AnimalCrossing,3ds9k7,-ThisWasATriumph,5,Sat Jul 18 23:36:11 2015 UTC,"They probably had a TV in the room, sometimes that plays the song if I remember right."
AnimalCrossing,3ds9k7,JadeTheMoose,4,Sat Jul 18 23:42:46 2015 UTC,"Seeing as all TVs play the same thing at the same time, that more or less confirms it. Keep in mind that some TVs are cleverly hidden above the entrance doorway."

AnimalCrossing,3dqkph,PeachyEl,3,Sat Jul 18 14:19:31 2015 UTC,Yes it does. I ordered a crown once and just waited out the days required for upgrading.

AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,allosteric,91,Fri Jul 17 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It wouldn't even be that bad if they expanded the set to ""Party"" themed instead of just ""things made out of balloons."" Most of the balloon furniture is so gaudy that I'd rather make the gifts fall into the river than waste my time collecting them."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,jamesgames2k,9,Fri Jul 17 18:57:13 2015 UTC,I finally just stopped carrying my slingshot when I realized all you get is balloon furniture. I don't like the look of it so I just ignore the balloons now.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,tsaylor83,6,Sat Jul 18 11:50:19 2015 UTC,"But.. but, then you can't get the balloon medal."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,Nekolo,84,Sat Jul 18 14:39:03 2015 UTC,"I wish that after you finish collecting the complete balloon set, they would begin dropping standard items like they're SUPPOSED TO."

AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,SaltyBabe,8,Sat Jul 18 11:03:18 2015 UTC,no my dad is nin10do ur makeing him l00k b4d ur a fr4ud.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,Kinoyo,52,Sat Jul 18 06:45:18 2015 UTC,"They made a potentially collectable set extremely disposable. You think the game designers would of made standard furniture the main thing you find and then the balloon set the rare prize from balloons. There's nothing prestigious about completeing the balloon set since its so jarringly in your face to collect.  ...And its ugly to boot. I only use the lamps from the series (balloon lamp and balloon dog lamp). For any who might not know, balloon dogs can have their color changed by Cyrus and thus make their lighting a different hue. Very nifty, actually."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,Feathercatch,14,Fri Jul 17 20:16:07 2015 UTC,I love how you can change the color of the window exteriors by having different combinations of balloon dog lamps.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,ItCameFromGOOR,8,Fri Jul 17 21:19:43 2015 UTC,I love the balloon dog lamps! I have one in every color!
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,eizoop,4,Fri Jul 17 21:05:11 2015 UTC,"What colour do the exterior windows turn if you have one of each colour in the main room, all turned on at once?"
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,GuillotineGash,7,Sat Jul 18 03:36:35 2015 UTC,Nothing spectacular.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,eizoop,31,Sat Jul 18 04:44:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a really bizarre game design decision. I really like Animal Crossing but this idea should never have passed the suggestion stage. Feels like Wild World comes after New Leaf with regards to this feature - why go from a random variety of furniture to balloon only? Also second the gaudiness, it's a horrible set."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,DrTitanium,4,Fri Jul 17 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"There's an off chance it was a design oversight. They might have intended for randoms with rarer balloon drops, then just ran out of time--or forgot.   Not likely, mind you. But possible.   Edit: randoms, not ransoms!"
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,lionheartdamacy,20,Sat Jul 18 05:29:06 2015 UTC,It basically makes the slingshot useless in this game. At least in City Folk there was Gulliver.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,TornzIP,14,Fri Jul 17 21:05:40 2015 UTC,Also I have like four silver slingshots now if anyone wants one.

AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,eco_nomnom_ics,2,Sat Jul 18 07:52:50 2015 UTC,"Me too! At one point I had 7 of them, then just started throwing them away. Still trying to get that silver fishing rod from the museum though lol"
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,spacecatherder,12,Sat Jul 18 11:38:03 2015 UTC,I give all my balloon stuff to Claudia. I guess she found it so fugly that she won't even display it in her house.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,Serbaayuu,9,Fri Jul 17 19:35:10 2015 UTC,"Ugh, yes, they are disgusting.  I knocked down one or two, learned that was all I was getting, and then stopped.  I haven't used a slingshot in literal years.  I didn't even bother getting the silver and gold ones."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,brianhite,9,Fri Jul 17 22:25:37 2015 UTC,I'm trying to get the gold badge for shooting down balloons right now. And then I will ignore every other balloon always and forever. It's pretty ridiculous that there's a badge for shooting down 200 balloons when the balloons only contain one of 15 items (plus the one-time-only golden slingshot).
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,platcanet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:03:49 2015 UTC,i guess i'm really lucky... I got golden slingshot 1 month into my game :s glad to know I can just stop there now... don't really care about the balloon badge all that much. would rather spend my time doing something else...
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,stitchmaker,8,Sun Jul 19 02:38:16 2015 UTC,Yes. The mayor got her golden badge yesterday and can put the slingshot away. Try hitting a balloon down when the tarantula and scorpions are out.  I did and a tarantula spawned and freaked out.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,matzimazing,6,Fri Jul 17 22:39:47 2015 UTC,"The only annoying thing is getting 4 clocks, 3 chairs, 3 sofas, 3 hats, 3 doggies, and still missing much of the set."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,Korsola,5,Fri Jul 17 23:31:52 2015 UTC,Yes! I only bother collecting them if they happen to fly overhead and I'm not busy. Then I sell the furniture because it's so ugly.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,KoopaStarRoad,5,Fri Jul 17 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"The furniture groups in Wild World made balloon collecting even more interesting, since balloons always (?) contained items of a different furniture group your town's store had."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,Anggul,3,Fri Jul 17 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, after the first little bit of playing I stopped bothering with them altogether."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,UtterEast,4,Fri Jul 17 22:39:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. I liked the idea that the present content should be determined by the slingshot you use-- normal will give normal furniture with a chance for balloon, silver will give balloon, and gold will give normal and spotlight furniture."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,moocow_101,4,Sat Jul 18 02:52:08 2015 UTC,Pretty disappointed when I came to that conclusion. I don't care for the balloon set so I usually mail them to other villagers.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,ItCameFromGOOR,3,Sat Jul 18 20:08:27 2015 UTC,Totally
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,SaltyBabe,3,Fri Jul 17 18:53:30 2015 UTC,Totally.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,AllSeeingGoggles,3,Sat Jul 18 11:08:27 2015 UTC,"The only piece in the set I've ever decided to keep for more than a day was the Balloon Clock for my first floor (fun & games theme), and even then it eventually got replaced by the Kiddie Wall Clock."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,trulyfascinating,3,Sat Jul 18 02:30:42 2015 UTC,Getting the gold balloon badge was a wonderful day. I never had to carry around my slingshot again.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,staeples,3,Sat Jul 18 04:30:59 2015 UTC,I dont even bother buying slingshots when I reset towns. Waste of the balloon. I liked when they were just random items. the set is so gaudy anyway
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,savageboredom,3,Sat Jul 18 05:36:27 2015 UTC,"When I was collecting the Balloon set, no. Once I had all of it (many times over), yes."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,SashayShante,2,Sat Jul 18 06:57:57 2015 UTC,They're too common now too. I don't pop them anymore like in WW.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,katysu,2,Sat Jul 18 09:20:41 2015 UTC,"I just accept what we get, no point in fussing. I keep going for the balloons for the gold sling shot, badge and for the dog lamp - I change it into the feng shui colours yellow & green (its red to begin with). Dog lamp: If you are in the US then the colours don't match what cryus tells you, you are going to get (check Liquefy's faq on gamefaqs for what you need to ask for to get what you want). In the UK the colours are not mixed up, you ask for green & you get green."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,Xero_K,2,Sat Jul 18 12:22:52 2015 UTC,"This is one of my few issues with New Leaf. I have the golden slingshot and the most interesting thing I could shoot down is another golden slingshot. The balloon dog lamp is cool, but the rest really don't interest me, and the silver/gold versions seem like a waste because the only place they'd really get some fun use is an island tour that doesn't allow them. Nothing amusing or all that tricky to shoot down once you have the silver and gold slingshots."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,eeelisabeth,2,Sat Jul 18 13:52:27 2015 UTC,I miss the ACWW mechanic. I used to get so excited when I heard the balloon blowing through the wind. A new present? Hell yeah! But now it's just so disappointing.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,PacManDreaming,2,Sat Jul 18 16:06:10 2015 UTC,I see I'm not the only one who thinks this furniture set is ugly and gaudy.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,Auroness,4,Sun Jul 19 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"In a way, I can see why it is limited to a single series. A balloon floats over head ever 10 minutes(?). If Every one of them dropped a new furniture item, it would ruin an economy. Getting 2 pieces of random furniture per day from trees is great. Getting 12 pieces of new furniture from balloons is not great."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,Hemansno1fan,19,Fri Jul 17 21:04:03 2015 UTC,Making beetles year round didn't already ruin the economy though?
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,spacecatherder,11,Fri Jul 17 21:11:24 2015 UTC,"Zing!  If we're being frank though, making all the house expansion culminate to about 7.5 MILLION bells was a cruel joke by the devs so they needed some kind of way to make it less ""Mario Lost Levels/Japan Super Mario Bros. 2"" hard and more ""Doki Doki Panic/NTSC (and PAL) Super Mario Bros. 2"" hard."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,SaltyBabe,3,Fri Jul 17 22:48:05 2015 UTC,Wow that's one way to explain your point...
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,Auroness,2,Sat Jul 18 11:07:41 2015 UTC,but at least you have to take the time to sit through a boat ride.

AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,henryuuk,3,Sat Jul 18 16:00:25 2015 UTC,"I thought of that, and it's true that in Wild World balloon spawning was much more limited, but still the number of balloons I realistically see in a day is about the same as the amount of furniture I can shake from my trees in a day."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,StaticScreen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:44:04 2015 UTC,I agree that it's boring that they only have balloon furniture inside them. That being said I just stopped shooting them down. It's not really a chore if you have no need to shoot them down.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,henryuuk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:48:06 2015 UTC,"If you want to collect all the badges, you are forced to shoot them down eventually though"
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,StaticScreen,2,Sat Jul 18 09:01:31 2015 UTC,That's true. I just don't know why someone would continue to force themselves to do it even if they really aren't enjoying it.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,SaltyBabe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:03:40 2015 UTC,Cause it would be pretty stupid to have all gold badges except the balloon badges.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,magicpup,7,Sat Jul 18 09:05:07 2015 UTC,I don't know if I'd consider not getting all of the badges in NL to be ''stupid'' but to each their own.
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,CodyMKW,5,Sat Jul 18 09:09:21 2015 UTC,"I kind of see it the opposite way... It's ""stupid"" to waste your time doing something you don't enjoy. I always thought of the badges as a way to show off what you liked/did well not just a % of what you've done."
AnimalCrossing,3dnjaz,pieman2005,-7,Sat Jul 18 11:10:59 2015 UTC,Ummmm don't shoot down balloons then?

AnimalCrossing,3dq4zd,ledgenskill,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:12:44 2015 UTC,You can't undo move outs even if you time travel backwards.

AnimalCrossing,3doisl,Kigurumix,4,Fri Jul 17 23:58:11 2015 UTC,"The thing about animal crossing is there's alot of things that go on in the game that you won't know about unless you look them up. For example, if you run in your town, over time your grass will start to fade. You might care about that, you might not, but you wouldn't necessarily know that would happen without looking it up. I would suggest reading faq's about the game and looking up tips and things to help you learn more about it. There's a lot of different things that you can do that will affect your luck in the game and things that you can learn that will help you make bells and expand your town faster. Of course you don't have to go into all the details of the game. You'll still be fine if you never look up a single thing about it and just play it by ear but personally, when I first started playing I found it really helpful to read about the game to learn more about it. Anyway, good luck and welcome to the world of animal crossing!"

AnimalCrossing,3doisl,Ryoshi217,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:24:35 2015 UTC,The basic social element of Animal Crossing may seem shallow but it's one of the more charming features of the series. You'll favour certain villagers and villager types while disliking others. Have fun with this mechanic and try to get a mix of cool villagers!
AnimalCrossing,3doisl,seven_roses34,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:19:49 2015 UTC,"Hit the rocks! Dig two holes diagonally and wedge yourself between them (leaving space all around the rock) and then hit those rocks! You'll find one that shoots money out. This happens daily. A great way to get Bells early on.   Put flowers of the same type near each other and water them all daily - new flowers of that type may generate in different colors (red near yellow can make orange, white near white will make something too, etc.).   Keep an eye on something like Thonky that tells you what insects/fish/sea creatures are available each month and make sure you catch them all. Turn them in to the museum immediately so you never have to wonder what's in there versus what's in your encyclopedia - when you complete the one, you'll have completed the other.   Go to the island daily (once it appears; you'll know when this happens and there isn't anything you have to do except keep playing). The stuff for sale here is only available on the island and can only be bought while on the island.   If you get sloppy furniture, do not get rid of it. It's hard to come by. Once you get the catalog (again, you'll know when this happens but it takes awhile), you'll be able to see which items can be reordered. (You can also use online resources to check if your catalog is not yet available.) The items that cannot be reordered are (typically) extremely rare.  The FAQ has more info and probably all of the above too, but the rocks were the main thing I wish I'd known! So many Bells to be had! And so easy to get them!   Welcome to the community and have fun with the game!"

AnimalCrossing,3dpowp,wingedhamham,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:21:08 2015 UTC,My favorite is cranky too..especially little ones like Vladimir. What's cuter than a tiny pink cub that's cranky?!

Lazy villagers definitely get the best designs, though. :3  I'd say Smugs are my favourites overall, since I like a lot of their designs as well (and even those I don't like, I can see some appeal in)."

AnimalCrossing,3dpowp,GooeyGoodra11,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:45:18 2015 UTC,Lazy and Normal are my two favorites. They are always so sweet. Nate and Caroline have been in my town since day 1 and I'll never let them go.

AnimalCrossing,3dn7dc,ztc0611,3,Fri Jul 17 18:57:59 2015 UTC,"I always thought they couldn't get letters until they had un-packed, and paid off Noodling's extortion fees to set up a mailbox (which doesn't exist)."
AnimalCrossing,3dn7dc,Auroness,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:07:48 2015 UTC,"Hmmm that's an interesting theory! Erik was a camper in my village who I convinced to move in and I actually wrote him a letter when his plot was down but not moved it. It still holds since I HAD met him as a camper and the letter would be delivered when the house is fully constructed.  I've done this with a few villagers I think, all of whom were campers or intentional move ins from other people on AdoptMyVillager."
