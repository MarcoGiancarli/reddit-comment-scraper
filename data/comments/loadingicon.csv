loadingicon,3e0q6t,AdmiralPotato,7,Tue Jul 21 01:46:35 2015 UTC,While this looks freaking amazing...   I feel like it isn't quite right for a loading icon.
loadingicon,3e0q6t,UnopenedBox,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:57 2015 UTC,"Hello! I'm a Blender user, and this is super cool, but this node setup you've got is the most esoteric thing I've seen in my life. Care to explain?"
loadingicon,3e0q6t,Poyoarya,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:48:17 2015 UTC,"Well, to start, these nodes are part of the Blender Animation Nodes addon, which I first learned about through BlenderNation on this post, titled ""Review: Animation Nodes Addon"". There are a lot of videos there that introduce you to some basic concepts of what's going on in mine.  http://www.blendernation.com/2015/03/17/review-animation-nodes-addon/  Here are some awesome video tutorials by the developer:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFSQhJg6cGLIZwDpScK1v1m1NSZnrCTQN  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFSQhJg6cGLKq8WbouMNBOHbMd7xUhuom  Second, try installing the addon and following along with the videos above.  Here's basically what my node configuration is doing.  I start with creating an Object Instancer node, which results in an Object List. That's how you take one object that already existed in your scene and produce a large number of copies to play with. Then, I pass that Object List into a Loop Call node, which is like creating a ""forEach"" loop which iterates over all of the objects in that object list. The Loop Start node is like the inner body of that forEach loop. I take only the Index of each object in that list and use that as my well index in building a hexagonal grid.  The chunk of 7 nodes at the top left gets me the value of time in seconds, plus some offset and an inverse time value as well.  The stuff in the middle is that hexagonal grid, and time plugs into it to move the grid primarily along the Y axis, I think.  The chunk in the top right takes the position of the objects defined in the middle and says ""Scale down more as you approach the negative Y axis, but don't get larger than 0.25 or smaller than 0.00"".  Then at the end, there's the Transforms Output, and it takes all of the work that I did to get the offsets I needed from Time, the X/Y position in the hexagonal grid, and the Scale, and actually applies them to that object in the Object list.  And that work is all repeated on every object on every frame. AWWW YEAH. Define one algorithm, apply it to all the objects in the set over and over again! :D"

If you look at your gif in a certain way, you can see the big tetrahedron turning in the opposite direction. And then you see the two smaller tetrahedrons as something that looks like it should be in the center, but goes behind the edges of the big one somehow. It's extremely weird and it's why I didn't believe it was a physical, 3-dimensional object instead of a weird 4d singularity.  The best way to ""switch"" directions I found is to look at the circular hole in the bottom of the tetrahedron, and seeing the upper rim as if it was the farthest, and the ring turning clockwise instead of counter-clockwise."

loadingicon,3c5gz8,Tesserach,5,Sun Jul 5 05:40:20 2015 UTC,I'd prefer it if the motion was continuous rather than 'bouncing' off each end. Still worth an upvote though.
loadingicon,3c5gz8,grundlebuster,9,Sun Jul 5 08:36:25 2015 UTC,"it's not bouncing off of the sides, it's just that the two dimensional perspective doesn't let you see the medial(?) movement. imagine looking at it from directly overhead, where all the points would be moving in a perfect circle."

loadingicon,3c5gz8,Dwarvy,2,Sun Jul 5 16:09:51 2015 UTC,"I thought it reverses too, but then I thought ""how would I want it to be?"", but the end of the animation all of the pendulums are on the right side, and the only place to go is to the left.  I think we feel it is reversing cause we are used to seeing a pendulum go from one side to another through the state of being a straight line in the middle ... but this animation isn't setup like that."
loadingicon,3c5gz8,autowikibot,6,Sun Jul 5 17:31:51 2015 UTC,It is continuous motion! Each circle moves back and forth sinusoidally. It just so happens that they all line up on the right side. So it's coincidence that this looping is identical to it ping-pong-ing.

loadingicon,3c4qz4,Seesawkarma,5,Sat Jul 4 21:23:31 2015 UTC,ELI5 what is going on here?
loadingicon,3c4qz4,ghost43,7,Sun Jul 5 07:55:02 2015 UTC,"In adddition to what /u/ghost43 said, this is an animation that illustrates the dependencies present in inter-prediction, a way to better compress images. You can get a rough idea of what is in one area of an image by looking at what is around it. In the case of HEVC video, it uses the coding tree units (64x64 squares of pixels, the black grid lines in the image) to the left, above, above left, and above right for inter prediction. That means to decode a CTU, you have to wait for those other blocks it is dependent on to have already been decoded. If your decoder was single-threaded, it could just go left to right and top to bottom, decoding each CTU and knowing its dependencies are ready. But with a multithreaded decoder, another thread can start on another row, but must stay 2 CTUs behind what is being decoded on the row above.  The animation you are seeing was created from timing measurements from an actual decoder, and you can see that not all CTUs are created equal. Some CTUs are subdivided (gray grid lines), and the ones with more detail are subdivided more. The CTUs with more detail are slower to decode, so sometimes you will have one row holding up the progress of the next. When a CTU goes from dark to light gray in the animation, that indicates it has its dependencies above it ready."
loadingicon,3c4qz4,sculptedpixels,3,Sun Jul 5 16:10:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's how certain image formats load, and the size of the squares represents the amount of detail. If there's a lot of different colours, there's going to be smaller squares but if there's a lot of the same colours then the squares will be bigger"

Lighting was via Global Illumination with a Red/Green/Blue gradient as a ""sky"" light source (essentially a giant sphere surrounding the scene that creates realistic lighting)  I rendered it out with a separate alpha channel and brought it into AfterEffects for the final touch of adding in the grey background and speeding it up a bit.   Finally, I used Miro Video Encoder to directly encode it as a WebM so Gyfycat doesn't apply any ugly compression.   Can you make a bigger version?   Absolutely. The original render output was 1280x1280 and the only real limit on resolution is the time it would take to render everything. I rendered this one out at 60fps for maximum smoothness."

loadingicon,39xxkt,king_of_the_universe,4,Tue Jun 16 09:33:49 2015 UTC,It could be rotating until the loading stops. You could then make the middle blob a button!

loadingicon,39xxkt,king_of_the_universe,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:23:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I think that's not a good idea:  Ideally, a loading screen (e.g. between maps in a game) should have a toggle button that is available right away. Depending on its state, the game would continue directly after loading is completed or would wait for the user's input, a sorely missing industry standard.  Maybe the central button could be the toggle button, and its color could indicate the state. When loading is completed and the blobs have merged back to the center, the center could be the trigger to continue. But that's also not ideal: Why should the user have to seek out a single spot on the screen? There is no advantage. It would be like the Steam store video player until a short time ago: Clicking on the screen did nothing, you needed to click on the tiny play/pause button.  I think the interaction should be screen-wide, so the button concept, while nice, is imho out of the question. The blobs-button concept could be used in a different situation than this, however."

I'm not all that familiar with the coding portion of After Effects, so if there's an easier way to do it (which I'm sure there has to be) I don't know what it is. I'll try to explain it as best I can through text, though.  Each letter has its own composition. Basically what's going on is I made the letter oscillate, then I made the darkest green shape (just a 135º extension of the letter) and parented it to the oscillating letter.  Next, I made a mask for the darkest green shape that hides any part of it that would appear behind the letter's starting position (any part that, in 3D space, would exist behind the background plane). The shadow is the same thing, you just make the shape extend 315º off the shape and use the same masking technique."

loadingicon,38870s,CJ_Productions,4,Wed Jun 3 02:26:52 2015 UTC,"Squaring the circle:       Squaring the circle is a problem proposed by ancient geometers. It is the challenge of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge. More abstractly and more precisely, it may be taken to ask whether specified axioms of Euclidean geometry concerning the existence of lines and circles entail the existence of such a square.  In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem which proves that pi (π) is a transcendental, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. It had been known for some decades before then that the construction would be impossible if pi were transcendental, but pi was not proven transcendental until 1882. Approximate squaring to any given non-perfect accuracy, in contrast, is possible in a finite number of steps, since there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to π.  The expression ""squaring the circle"" is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do the impossible.   The term quadrature of the circle is sometimes used to mean the same thing as squaring the circle, but it may also refer to approximate or numerical methods for finding the area of a circle.

It doesn't make sense to me that any particle can become indivisible.. matter should be able to exist infinitely in both larger and smaller focuses, infinitely in both directions.    If you think about it, this 'fractal' idea is the ideal way to store information in different dimensions of size, which could explain how there is something of higher power manipulating what we know in the universe, extracting information from different size scales in the infinite framework.

loadingicon,34i7av,Eedis,7,Fri May 1 12:26:59 2015 UTC,This could certainly be made. It is just circle based math. Every part of this animation can be programmed.
loadingicon,34i7av,ItsAaronGeorge,1 point,Sat May 2 00:07:38 2015 UTC,That's what I said....
loadingicon,34i7av,Eedis,1 point,Sat May 2 06:30:42 2015 UTC,"What you said was that it couldn't be parsed as a real loading icon. To which I can confidently say that it can be a real loading icon. I'm not sure if you used parsed in the proper context but I'll explain how you are incorrect.  You have two values. An inner circle value and outer circle value. The inner circle counts from 0 to 100. At set intervals the outer circle's value updates to match the inner circle's.  The animation that occurs when this happens can be done in several different ways depending on what system you are implementing it with so I'll just explain the math of it.  You need to get the total circumference of the inner circle and create an arc that is the same percentage of the circumference of the inner circle's value.  You then need to do the same calculation for the outer circle.  You then interpolate the position, stroke size and length of the arc you created. You then continue this until the arc is in the correct position on the outer circle.  After a set amount of time, you then repeat this process with the remaining segments of the outer circle until the total length of all the outer circle arcs are the same value as the circumference of the outer circle.  Of course you will need to animate the colour of the arcs as they hit the outer circle as they have a slight glow.  To create the outer force field you pretty much repeat the same thing as you did for the main part of the animation.  As I said, it is entirely possible to program this as a functioning loading icon without faux values."
loadingicon,34i7av,ItsAaronGeorge,5,Sat May 2 06:54:22 2015 UTC,"This is a gif.... You cannot parse a gif to coincide with individual events. However, this gif acts as good proof of concept/concept art. I don't think you understand what I meant"
loadingicon,34i7av,Eedis,12,Sat May 2 12:41:41 2015 UTC,"Since you can programmatically stop gif animations, this works just fine.

loadingicon,34i7av,cciv,17,Fri May 1 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's fake data.  It pretty clearly implies that the loading is moving in chunks, which would be inaccurate in almost any case.  It's really only valid as a loading icon for the gif itself.  :)  The design is great though, just not as a baked out gif."
loadingicon,34i7av,Lusankya,10,Fri May 1 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know what kinds of data you're handling, but this would work great for a lot of things.  Think of a typical serialized asset. You have three steps to load: Unpack/decompress, parse, and link. Typically parsing and linking are pretty quick. Have chunks 'peek in' when unpacking, and 'pop high' when linking.  Who says it has to be a gif? Draw it using vectors and compute on the fly. The math is certainly simple enough, even with animation built in. That won't work well with UE or Unity unless you expose more of their asset managers than most people would bother to, but it's pretty trivial if you've already taken the lid off the box and know what you're doing in there.  Is there a license on this? I have a few applications this would work really well with."
loadingicon,34i7av,cciv,3,Fri May 1 22:30:15 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I like the design, I was just saying that this exact gif with this exact non-linear progress would be unsuitable."
loadingicon,34i7av,cciv,6,Fri May 1 23:06:48 2015 UTC,"It's not fake if you advance the animation by X% each time a task is complete (which is what you'd be doing anyway). This is, incidentally, what you do with a progress bar the difference being that you aren't changing the data state of the control (loading icon) but merely instead the data state of the client (browser) in terms of which frame it's showing. Validating data  on a server or browser is a bigger difference.   If, however, this is still an issue, break down the frames into a set of images, display each one as needed, starting a non-looped animation as soon as $(""#iconSlice"" + progressCounter).is("":visible"") returns true."
loadingicon,34i7av,GoldenOnyx,8,Fri May 1 15:08:33 2015 UTC,"But the percentages in the animation aren't linear, so X% in the animation might show X-3% on screen."

This means you'll show frames 0 through whatever for 5%, the previous set through whatever for 10%.   Or you could break down and figure out how to do it in the html5 canvas which might be more involved on the start but faster and less download time once you've finished it."

Very few loading percentages on web apps are that accurate. Very few web apps require that level of accuracy on a loading screen... because... you know... it's loading which means things aren't executing and you're not interacting. This is not a progress icon. It's a loading icon. Big difference.

loadingicon,32wdgz,PointyOintment,3,Fri Apr 17 08:52:02 2015 UTC,"Deferent and epicycle:       In the Hipparchian and Ptolemaic systems of astronomy, the epicycle (literally: on the circle in Greek) was a geometric model used to explain the variations in speed and direction of the apparent motion of the Moon, Sun, and planets. In particular it explained the apparent retrograde motion of the five planets known at the time. Secondarily, it also explained changes in the apparent distances of the planets from Earth.  It was first proposed by Apollonius of Perga at the end of the 3rd century BC. It was developed by Apollonius of Perga and Hipparchus of Rhodes, who used it extensively, during the second century BC, then formalized and extensively used by Ptolemy of Thebaid in his 2nd-century AD astronomical treatise the Almagest.  Epicyclical motion is used in the Antikythera Mechanism, an ancient Greek astronomical device for compensating for the elliptical orbit of the Moon, moving faster at perigee and slower at apogee than circular orbits would, using four gears, two of them engaged in an eccentric way that quite closely approximates Kepler's second law.

loadingicon,32nymf,AdmiralPotato,3,Wed Apr 15 08:47:21 2015 UTC,"You can see an overview of the node setup that I created this scene with at the Imgur gallery here: http://imgur.com/gallery/3MApw/ I have really been enjoying the animated GIF works of designer friend IsoPoly (https://dribbble.com/IsoPoly) recently. As I have studied his animations, I have been wondering how I could create something of my own that has so many moving parts. The mere concept of managing a scene with so many components was daunting to me. So in order to accomplish this level of complexity, I was practicing up on my skills in Python to accomplish such a task - but then I came across a review for the Blender Animation Nodes addon over the weekend. What's this? No need to navigate the complex and sometimes obscure hierarchy of Blender's Python API? Interactive and real-time feedback on a continually animating scene when I change values in a node network? No more complex and awkward driver setup where it's hard just to navigate between individual animated properties? YES PLEASE! Review: http://www.blendernation.com/2015/03/17/review-animation-nodes-addon/ Addon: https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation-nodes The badass who designed the system, Jacques Lucke, was making my dream of node based object instancing and animation control possible with this addon. It was a little bit unstable and behaved a little bit strangely in a few ways I could not have expected until after I had wrapped my mind around its implementation of the object list looping concept - but in just a single evening of focus, I was able to learn the tool well enough to produce this fun little system of objects. I would highly recommend this plugin to anyone who already loves node based workflows and knows a little bit of trigonometry. Just make sure to save your work frequently while incrementing your blend file's version number, and learn how to use Blender's ""Recover Auto Save"" feature. ;) I hope that by exposing this addon to more users, we'll increase the likelihood of getting this addon, or something very similar to it, developed to a point of stability, bundled with the software and enabled by default. This kind of power should be at everyone's fingertips."

loadingicon,30mdiv,lotsalote,42,Sat Mar 28 18:27:56 2015 UTC,It feels like the sum of the broken parts adds up to more volume than the donut they came from.
loadingicon,30mdiv,SirSupay,57,Sat Mar 28 22:18:35 2015 UTC,I think it might because the donut is actually a lot thicker than it seems http://i.imgur.com/HdwF23t.png

You can adjust several settings, like where you want it to crack, how many pieces, etc.   After you've broken it in to pieces, what you want to play around with are the ""Rigid Body Tools"". This is basically the physics engine that will decide how the different objects in the scene acts with gravity / forces.  When you dive in to these things, I can guarantee you hours of fun :) Especially playing around with the rigid body simulations in real-time. Cheers!"

loadingicon,2ykx9w,AquaWolfGuy,2,Tue Mar 10 23:16:09 2015 UTC,"Yes. The amount of coins are always about the same, so if you're downloading a bigger file the coins will come in more slowly."
loadingicon,2ykx9w,Cintax,14,Wed Mar 11 08:18:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like the examples of ""progress"" are really just subtly shifting to the right, giving the illusion that they're moving along, as if they're inside of some side-scrolling game. We know the blotches and the squares aren't actually moving right, but they create an illusion that they are by making them move to the right relative to a background, which is slowly moving left."
loadingicon,2ykx9w,Cintax,6,Tue Mar 10 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"They were the best examples I could find quickly, just to give an idea. There are certainly other ways to do it. Do you think, though, that the illusion of progress is important to a loading icon?  I guess that's what I'm hoping to find out from everyone."
loadingicon,2ykx9w,DustryQueef,6,Tue Mar 10 20:10:46 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that it's important, but it also depends on the timeline. I think the endlessly looping ones work better for quick loading or transitions.   So if, for example, the loading time takes less than 2-3 seconds, a simple looping circular loader works better since you get to see most of the animation in that time.   But for prolonged loading times which can take several seconds or even minutes, a subtle sense of progress definitely helps, because at that point, you're actively waiting to proceed."
loadingicon,2ykx9w,invertedspear,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:38:10 2015 UTC,"I'd say yes, I love all the gifs in this subreddit but a bunch of them just don't feel anything like a realistic loading icon."
loadingicon,2ykx9w,baskandpurr,8,Tue Mar 10 20:21:19 2015 UTC,IMO you are demonstrating the difference between a wait icon and a loading icon. The problem is no gif can show 'loading' because it can't get feedback from the server. The best to can do is move the gif along maybe from left to right as the load occurs
loadingicon,2ykx9w,protestor,6,Tue Mar 10 21:13:48 2015 UTC,"There's two senses in which people can talk about this. The sub focuses on loading icons in the sense that they tell you the program is busy doing something. Their purpose is to let you know the program hasn't crashed. The program doesn't necessarily know how long it will be doing those things but as long as something moves it serves its purpose.  What the sub doesn't do is progress bars, which show you a graphical representation of a process (such as loading) and then attempt to illustrate how far through the process something is. Those only get used when a program has a way of measuring how far through the process it is or can predict how long something might take.  Your example of busy icon with a sense of progress is actually quite nice. I guess it's a matter of what then user feels about the message that image carries. In practice, most loading icons represent 'endlessly going around in circles' which seems quite a bad message when you think about it.  I'd like to see loading icons that don't loop. I think the looping must be quite simplistic or it becomes a tell tale. You eventually notice the loop and realise that its just blindly going through the motions. Like a CD skipping."
loadingicon,2ykx9w,Strbrst,3,Tue Mar 10 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I wish the ""spinners"" were used only when the program has no idea when a task will complete. Also, if the program discover it has no idea whether the task will complete, it should have a timeout and after that, either ask the user if the program should continue waiting whatever it needs, or simply abort.  For most programs, the spinner at most tells that the thread running the animation didn't freeze."

Looks like the original source goes back even longer, although Sindre's profile no longer has the photo. I wonder what the original-orignal post of the image was?  The commenter you thank says it must've been created with Swift 3D. The Internet Archive/Wayback Machine shows Swift 3D was released in April of 2000. So I guess it can go back only as far as 2000, probably 2002 or so.  Do you have a statistic of how many times your image was downloaded?

I was under the impression that the commenter (hysteria2k) meant the animation was actually part of the program itself. It does use a lot of rendered icons on its buttons. He said ""Aint that a finished thingy thing on the program Swift 3d?"" which to me sounded like it was displayed when your render was finished or something.  The only statistics about mine that I can see are as follows:   Views: 42,673 (271 today)  Favourites: 1,854  Comments: 330  Downloads: 1,482   I'm sure it's been viewed many more times than that, since the image has been saved and uploaded as an avatar so many times.

loadingicon,2x92sm,sickmate,3,Wed Mar 11 02:26:58 2015 UTC,"Cinema 4D!  Right, more details.  So I made a tube, made it super thick, and chopped it in half. Then threw a cylinder on one end of it, where I chopped it in half. Made the cylinder as think as the end of the cylinder.  Here's a picture since I suck at explaining.  Then I merged all that together so I could use it as a boole(which is Cinema4D talk for a.. crop, I guess. A mask if you have experience with those. Basically the space that the tube/cylinder takes up can be removed from other objects. Or, in this case, I can set it to remove all the space outside of it. Like.. overlap. Err, whatever space is taken up by some other object as well as the tube/cylinder.)  Another picture, this is pre-boole(or mask/overlap/whatever)  And this is post-boole or whatever. As you can see all the space that was taken up by both the redish disk and the tube/cylinder is still there.  After that I used another boole to cut a hole into the fat end of that, and stuck a small disk(the same size as the hole I just cut out) between the point and the fat end.  Pic pls  After that I duplicated the whole thing and made it perpendicular to the first one. Added textures  Lastly, animation! In this case it's as simple as making each half spin."

loadingicon,2wl7wm,nickolasstone,15,Sat Feb 21 02:42:55 2015 UTC,Chromatic Aberration
loadingicon,2wl7wm,ABarkingCow,7,Sat Feb 21 04:15:10 2015 UTC,"Chromatic aberration:       In optics, chromatic aberration (CA, also called achromatism, chromatic distortion, and spherochromatism) is a type of distortion in which there is a failure of a lens to focus all colors to the same convergence point.  It occurs because lenses have different refractive indices for different wavelengths of light (the dispersion of the lens). The refractive index decreases with increasing wavelength.   Chromatic aberration manifests itself as ""fringes"" of color along boundaries that separate dark and bright parts of the image, because each color in the optical spectrum cannot be focused at a single common point. Since the focal length f of a lens is dependent on the refractive index n, different wavelengths of light will be focused on different positions.

loadingicon,2uto9m,autowikibot,3,Thu Feb 5 22:07:32 2015 UTC,"Hairy ball theorem:       The hairy ball theorem of algebraic topology states that there is no nonvanishing continuous tangent vector field on even-dimensional n-spheres. For the ordinary sphere, or 2‑sphere, if f is a continuous function that assigns a vector in R3 to every point p on a sphere such that f(p) is always tangent to the sphere at p, then there is at least one p such that f(p) = 0. In other words, whenever one attempts to comb a hairy ball flat, there will always be at least one tuft of hair at one point on the ball. The theorem was first stated by Henri Poincaré in the late 19th century.

loadingicon,2tfz14,butterforfilm,7,Fri Jan 23 21:01:03 2015 UTC,Here's a codepen I did a while ago with a slightly different version of the effect.
loadingicon,2tfz14,thespite,1 point,Fri Jan 23 23:28:45 2015 UTC,Can you pm me an explanation on the code? I'm starting to program in c++ and this really intrigues me.
loadingicon,2tfz14,Darkrhoad,2,Sat Jan 24 06:11:39 2015 UTC,"If you look closely one dot, it's only moving in circle. The rest are doing the same, but with different angle offset :)"
loadingicon,2tfz14,dgoberna,1 point,Sat Jan 24 10:39:16 2015 UTC,Haha I meant more about the code behind the link he posted. Like the Java script
loadingicon,2tfz14,Darkrhoad,2,Sat Jan 24 18:35:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, true! Sorry, missed the link. If you aim to c++, I'd say that code is not very helpful. He's using css transforms to move the circles"
loadingicon,2tfz14,dgoberna,1 point,Sat Jan 24 20:39:10 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'm starting out with c++ and going to transition into java to do android dev.
loadingicon,2tfz14,Darkrhoad,1 point,Sat Jan 24 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"So you are not going to use c++ for anything? If the only interest in learning c++ is change to java, then don't waste time and learn Java, i'd say."
loadingicon,2tfz14,dgoberna,1 point,Sat Jan 24 22:11:56 2015 UTC,I will use c++ but I mainly want to get into android dev. Plus the classes I'm taking are for c++ and then I'm going to start on Java. I would start learning online but I end up on Reddit anytime I try.
loadingicon,2tfz14,Darkrhoad,1 point,Sun Jan 25 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"Sure. This is more a CSS effect than a JavaScript one.   The JS part just places dots on screen. The dots are a div inside a div, the outer div is placed in a grid arrangement. There's two divs because I have two transforms being animated with CSS for each dot: rotation and scale, and the best way is to decouple the transforms into different DOM elements.   The loop in JavaScript just modifies the delay of the animations to create the wavy motion. Try changing the delay value and it will be very clear what it does.  The rest is the CSS that defines transform animations: one is rotating the div, and the other is scaling the div. So when you have an offseted div inside a rotating div, you get a circular motion.  It's not really about general programming, but about programming CSS. With C/C++ you would have to use/code your own transform and tweening library."

loadingicon,2tfz14,davebees,3,Sat Jan 24 05:16:26 2015 UTC,"Trapcode's echospace plugin made my life a lot easier. I made one dot move in a circle and then used the plugin to make a whole row of them, each offset by 6 frames. Then I precomposed the completed row and ran the plugin to duplicate it and fill the vertical space, also offsetting each one 6 frames. You could do it manually without the plugin, it would just take extra time."

loadingicon,2ppmoh,lx45803,1 point,Fri Dec 19 01:44:25 2014 UTC,"The resolution and frame rate have absolutely nothing to do with the colours. Gifs only support 8 bits per pixel, so only 256 colours can be used. I think the majority of the colours were used to gradient the spirals, so like 7 colours were used for the background. Gif encoders aren't bad, they just have to limit the colours drastically; this is why block-colour animations can look just like a video, since they use so few colours. Also, a 4k 60fps gif would be huge, and imgur doesn't support such big file sizes.    And this post is a fortnight old, by the way."
loadingicon,2ppmoh,CharlieDeBeadle,2,Thu Jan 1 10:44:16 2015 UTC,"Gifs only support 8 bits per pixel, so only 256 colours can be used.   This is actually not true. You can build true color images by layering multiple frames over each other with transparency. You can see an example of this here. It's inefficient, and made cripplingly infeasible by gif's shortcomings compared to modern video codecs, but it is possible.   Gif encoders aren't bad, they just have to limit the colours drastically; this is why block-colour animations can look just like a video, since they use so few colours.   Using few colours? You mean like the grayscale animation above?   Also, a 4k 60fps gif would be huge, and imgur doesn't support such big file sizes.   Yeah, I was just making a point. You can do incredible things with just basic gifs, but all too often programmers just don't care enough to implement proper gif encoding with adaptive error correction and good per-frame palette selection, despite it being an incredibly important format to get right considering its extensive use.   And this post is a fortnight old, by the way.   Seeing shitty software get a free pass due to technical misunderstandings makes me unreasonably angry. My madness cares not how necro my post may be."

Then, each smaller circle's start time is offset by some amount; anyone know what that number is?   I'd like to recreate this; possibly in CSS as an svg animation.

Look at the requirements in the sidebar:   Small, trippy-looking color-limited .gifs that would make good or at  least interesting animated icons or loading screens.   I only use 8 colours, with shading. I consider the corkscrew effect from a spinning helix to be ""trippy-looking"", but that's a subjective measure. I could make it smaller (both in file size and image dimensions), if you think that would satisfy your desires for a more appropriate loading screen.   Gifs posted should be a closed loop, and animated either by hand or computer.    I used my computer to animate this, using a program called OpenSCAD."

loadingicon,2ok2cq,self_defeating,5,Mon Dec 8 02:20:12 2014 UTC,"Why do so many people submitting here not understand what a loading icon is? This is probably one of the lowest-quality subreddits I've seen. The mods accept pretty much any interesting animation that remotely has something in common with loading icons.  This is a fucking watch on a textured background, cropped. Does anybody really think this could be used as a loading icon?"

loadingicon,2on5dw,CertainlyCLEAN,3,Mon Dec 8 21:34:08 2014 UTC,"Win 7 allows you to use live wallpapers, but win 8 does not. If you have win 8 you can either buy some software called DreamScene or make an animated Rainmeter skin."

Deskscape is my personal favorite.  It pauses the wallpaper when you have a full window, you have an option to pause when using battery power, and you can pause the wallpaper manually if needed.  You have to pay for it, but they offer a 30 day free trial."

loadingicon,2no2do,andreasdr,0,Sun Nov 30 22:34:50 2014 UTC,you do realize that all normal spirals are technically fibonacci spirals. the fibonacci sequence is simply a numerical definition whose ratio matches that of a standard circular spiral
loadingicon,2no2do,PM_ME_YOUR_FAV_SONG,6,Sat Nov 29 11:00:44 2014 UTC,this is not true
loadingicon,2no2do,davebees,2,Sat Nov 29 13:49:41 2014 UTC,"here's the fibonacci spiral. it's curves are defined by the fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio. any spiral that curls by this ratio (a logarithmic function) is a fibonacci spiral, and its what a ""normal"" spiral looks like. it's the most pervasive definition of a spiral in nature which is precisely what makes it fascinating. Humans have further gone to great lengths to repeat it in architecture, painting, and everyday modern objects.  the rest of the stuff in this gif is just artistic. unless you're trying to say that the triple helix (whose overall curve does describe the fibonacci spiral) uses the fibonacci sequence to describe the z axis movements of its individual helices, which i don't think it does.  edit: normal was probably a bad choice of words. i just meant that like every spiral you see in one of these gifs is a fibonacci spiral. and a fibonacci spiral is very basic this is just taking that spiral and adding a bunch of artistic license."

It goes 1-3-4-5-6-7-8.  A two-sided shape can only exist in 3D space.
loadingicon,2ndmdd,SocksForBreakfast,2,Tue Nov 25 21:14:50 2014 UTC,"Digon:       In geometry, a digon or 2-gon is a polygon with two sides (edges) and two vertices. It is degenerate in a Euclidean space, but may be non-degenerate in a spherical space as a pair of 180 degree arcs connecting antipodal points.  In Euclidean space a digon is regular, because its two edges are the same length and its two angles are equal (both being zero degrees). It has Schläfli symbol {2}.  Some authorities do not consider the digon to be a proper polygon because of its degeneracy in the Euclidean case. [citation needed]    Image i - On a circle, a nondegenerate antipodal digon is a tessellation composed of two vertices and two 180-degree arcs.

It basically does the same thing as a piston but using rotary motion instead of linear. This makes it very useful as a pump because it can be easily powered by a motor without any power transmission device (You would need a cam for a piston).  It can also be reversed and used as a pistonless combustion engine.  Ie: Fuel expands when the gap is small, causing it to turn, and exhaust is ejected as the gap shrinks again."

loadingicon,2lijgb,rumilb,7,Thu Nov 6 21:33:45 2014 UTC,"I appreciate the work you put in to create this. My suggestion would be to go triangle to circle, circle to square, square to x, then x go triangle. The transitions would be: triangle sides bulge out to form circle; corners come out to form square (essentially the opposite of the first transition, but now with more sides); the sides pivot on one endpoint and shrink, with the free endpoints all meeting in the center to form the x (if that doesn't make sense I can draw it for you); then the x moves upward, which makes the top half of the x disappear and bringing the third side of the triangle into frame."

We sift through public data sources to answer the question of what it's like to live somewhere before you move in. Right now, the focus is NYC, but we're making a big national push in the next few months.  The logo has a bit of history. Our company used to be called Rentenna (a wombination of Rent and Antenna) so the radio waves made a little more sense. When we made the name switch to reflect what our product became, we just continued to use the old R logo and just moved it to the middle instead of the front of the company name.

It doesn't look like a triangle though, the angles between the different shapes are clearly 90° so there should be four of them.

loadingicon,2jze1t,wakawakaching,2,Wed Oct 22 21:44:04 2014 UTC,I don't think it needs another shape! I love it the way it is. Everyone would add one more shape because it does make sense. But just because the transition resembles a cube doesn't mean that it the pattern of shapes has to be associated with that. I enjoyed having that expectation broken by something incredibly pleasant.

So what if it was from a tutorial. Like you said, you moved it closer to the realm of being your own by combining these things. I wouldn't have ever thought of that on my own and it looks great.  I looked at your portfolio and I really like the way it is presented it. You are doing all of the right things to get noticed. The breakdowns and analysis of your designs (ex: color choices for 'trendly' project) are all things that help engage potential clients. I enjoyed this animation a lot and I think that it's really cool. No shame, I am just a design nerd as well and I instantly recognized what I saw. Great work all around and thanks for sharing."

You have to do something else. I know you remade your face and that's not easy at all but change the colors, switch up the geometry, idk, give it a uniqueness that shows you can do more than recreate it. It looks fantastic, don't let me take that away from you, but I personally wouldn't be comfortable showing this without proving to myself and others that I didn't just follow the steps.

As in the tutorial, I used a glow plugin on the particles and played with the depth of field and the angle of the camera (and the orientation of the Form object itself).  I also simulated some kind of Chromatic Aberration by offsetting the R, G and B channels by a few frames each (inspired by this tutorial).  Oh and for it to loop, you'll need to use the Flow Loop option of the Fractal Field parameter in the Form Plugin.  Hope this helps!"

loadingicon,2fcl7e,protestor,1 point,Fri Sep 5 08:06:49 2014 UTC,"Hm, I wouldn't expect Processing to be like this. It looks like.. regular programming, and also the pushmatrix/popmatrix thing looks like OpenGL 1.x.  Actually. Is this C++? ... yep ahaha it is. Perhaps the magic of Processing is in its IDE?  I was expecting a more succinct or higher level code, not C-style fors and, uhm, bitshifts and other C++ stuff. Perhaps p5js is more convenient because it can be more higher level, with stuff like array.map()."
loadingicon,2fcl7e,scratchisthebest,1 point,Fri Sep 5 22:15:13 2014 UTC,"Processing is actually Java! But with a zillion convenient methods and functionality added on top of it. It's really fun to use and the IDE is super clean. Everything ""just works"" in my experiences with it.  I haven't seen the code yet (mobile), but are the bitshifts close to an array labeled pixels? That's typically used for composing the three RGB colors into the 1d pixels array a little bit faster then the built in method does it. Usually a part of davebees' chromatic aberration effect."

The project was initiated in 2001 by Casey Reas and Benjamin Fry, both formerly of the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Lab. One of the stated aims of Processing is to act as a tool to get non-programmers started with programming, through the instant gratification of visual feedback.

Given the structure of the experiment, it may or may not be possible to actually perform it, and if it can be performed, there need be no intention of any kind to actually perform the experiment in question. The common goal of a thought experiment is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question.  Famous examples of thought experiments include Schrödinger's cat, illustrating quantum indeterminacy through the manipulation of a perfectly sealed environment and a tiny bit of radioactive substance, and Maxwell's demon, which attempts to demonstrate the ability of a hypothetical finite being to violate the second law of thermodynamics.    Image i - A famous example, Schrödinger's cat (1935), presents a cat that might be alive or dead, depending on an earlier random event. It illustrates the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation applied to everyday objects.

I know there are easier ways to draw them (I drew one from the equations once, then wrote a generator so I'd never have to again), and expect some twiddling to get it right. Still, it's the most accurate, and it'd be what a real planetary gearset is drawn with, since that shape is made so that the gears are always in contact and don't interfere.

loadingicon,2bz0ry,Mongooo,11,Fri Aug 8 06:44:35 2014 UTC,did you use the actually physical equation? a=v2 /r? because that would be really cool.
loadingicon,2bz0ry,OmniaMors,13,Mon Jul 28 20:34:46 2014 UTC,unfortunately not! the angular velocity of the dots decreases linearly with distance from the centre : (
loadingicon,2bz0ry,OmniaMors,12,Mon Jul 28 20:44:37 2014 UTC,it wouldnt be that hard to change if you wanted to. set the a to be a constant and solve for v  v = (a*r)0.5  now just pick a random ass number for a and your gif will model the real world!
loadingicon,2bz0ry,OmniaMors,4,Mon Jul 28 20:48:35 2014 UTC,"actually we can take it one step further, and show that gravity (which is the acceleration) in space is:  g = Gm/r2  where g is gravity, G is the gravitational constant, m is the mass of the center object, and r is the radius. to keep things simple we can just combine all our constants to get  g = k/r2  now we can combine this with our first equation  a=g v2 /r = k/r2  and solve for v in terms of r  v = (k/r)0.5  and since you used angular velocity we can convert to that using the equation v=w*r  w*r = (k/r)0.5 w = k0.5 / r1.5  and again since a constant to a power is still a constant we can simplify it further just a little  w = k_2 /r1.5  now plug that into your gif and you have an astronomically correct model!"
loadingicon,2bz0ry,VikingofRock,2,Tue Jul 29 01:39:38 2014 UTC,"The dots have to be following (a = v2 / r) because they are moving in a circle, and that equation holds for all circular motion. Since the OP said that angular velocity is decreasing linearly with distance, we get  a = v2 / r = w2 r = (b - c r)2 r  v2 = (b-c r)2 r2   v = b r - c r2  (where b and c are some arbitrary constants, v is the dot's velocity, w is the dot's angular velocity, a is the dot acceleration, and r is the dot's distance from the center)  So the velocity decreases with r near the center; whereas it decreases with r2 near the edge. I could believe it looking at the gif--it seems like the dots slow much more rapidly the further out you go. Pretty cool!"
loadingicon,2bz0ry,OmniaMors,2,Tue Jul 29 00:41:25 2014 UTC,"The dots have to be following (a = v2 / r) because they are moving in a circle   yes and no.  yes because as long as you have a defined velocity and radius you could technically calculate the acceleration.  no because you could have the dots move at any velocity at any radius, it could literally be a random number. which would defeat the purpose of having the relation to begin with."
loadingicon,2bz0ry,VikingofRock,2,Tue Jul 29 01:13:56 2014 UTC,"no because you could have the dots move at any velocity at any radius, it could literally be a random number. which would defeat the purpose of having the relation to begin with   I'm not sure I understand your point here. As long as the dot is moving in a circle at a constant velocity at a constant radius, it will have a well-defined acceleration given by (a = v2 / r), and it cannot have any other acceleration. Sure you can plug in any old number for v and r--the relation will still hold, and I would argue that's the whole point of the relation!  Edit: Wait, I think what you are saying here is that they don't all have the same acceleration. That's totally true, and it would have been interesting to see a gif where they did have the same acceleration. But there are lots of physical systems where objects at different radii have different accelerations!"
loadingicon,2bz0ry,OmniaMors,2,Tue Jul 29 03:02:23 2014 UTC,"it looks like i misunderstood you, i thought you were saying that in all cases it had to follow the relation with a constant acceleration. i actually did the math on a system with a varying acceleration (gravitational force) above."

When it came to uploading my code to OpenProcessing I came to the realization that it needed to be JS. Soo I threw my java code into the Processing IDE and fiddled around until I got it to work."

loadingicon,2av76g,Colonel__Korn,8,Wed Jul 16 23:12:10 2014 UTC,"It's not really ""Scared"" of facebook, it's more like changing your Bank.  Most deposit accounts are years and years old, because people hate change, especially in the internet age.  ""But opening an account at a bank can be done in mere minutes online now!""  That's true, but the problem can be summed up in one word: Autopay.  If I close my account at a bank, suddenly I have to go around and change all of my autopay information that is associated with that account.  Insurance, mortgage, utilities, Amazon one-click ordering, PayPal (if you are stupid enough to use PayPal).  People don't want to do this.  Moving the account isn't the issue, it's moving everything that associated with that account that's the issue.  And it's the same for Facebook  Facebook went live in 2004.  That means some people, myself included (signed up when you had to have a .edu email), have spent almost decade now building their profile.  Photos, friends, groups, years of posts, etc.  People are on FB not because of their profile, but because of the community of friends and the history they have built up.    Even though I can make a G+ profile and add all of the same photos, I won't have my timeline, and most importantly I won't have my friends.  What good is it to move to a new social network if you can't socialize with any of your friends?  So you have two choices: move to G+ and be alone, stay with FB and keep your friends.  At that point, it's almost a no-brainer."

loadingicon,2asyf0,redvonrowdy,4,Wed Jul 16 06:46:48 2014 UTC,"Miura fold:       The Miura fold (ミウラ折り, Miura-ori ?) is a method of folding a flat surface such as a sheet of paper into a smaller volume. It is named for Japanese astrophysicist Koryo Miura, who invented it.   The crease patterns of the Miura fold form a tessellation of the surface by parallelograms. In one direction, the creases of the pattern lie along straight lines, with each parallelogram forming the mirror reflection of its neighbor across each crease. In the other direction, the creases zigzag, and each parallelogram is the translation of its neighbor across the crease. Each of the zigzag paths of creases consists solely of mountain folds or of valley folds, with mountains alternating with valleys from one zigzag path to the next. Each of the straight paths of creases alternates between mountain and valley folds.   The Miura fold is a form of rigid origami, meaning that the fold can be carried out by a continuous motion in which, at each step, each parallelogram is completely flat. This property allows it to be used to fold surfaces made of rigid materials; for instance, it has been used to simulate large solar panel arrays for space satellites in the Japanese space program.     Image i - Crease pattern for a Miura fold. The parallelograms of this example have 84° and 96° angles.

I usually just stumble through public tutorials and figures out ways to integrate what someone else is doing. I'd like to get into more generative stuff, or make things like this scalable, but not quite there yet. I bet if you look for 3DS Max or Maya tutorials with either particle effects or advanced animation you should be able to find things"

loadingicon,29ddyn,KoaReedD,5,Sun Jun 29 10:51:33 2014 UTC,"It's basically 6 cubes in 6 different cloners all centred in the middle of the frame.   Each cloner is set up to create 20 clones of the original cube, each at 90% of the size of the last one.  To get the steps and the expanding animation I set up an individual step effector for each cloner. The step effector is pretty nifty because it applies the transformation you set to the last clone in the series and then interpolates the values of the clones in between.  So by setting the step effector to translate each cloner an equal distance but in a different direction from the others you get the expanded shape.  The animation itself was just a matter of increasing the step effector value to the right amount and then pulling it back to 0 at the origin, with the 90 degrees rotation thrown in-between."

I seam to be the only person who has spotted this but I thought that the original was a yin and yang rotating, but with half the image obscured. Do you think you could make that? like the full yin and yang rotating then maybe put like a red line across the center, as a like proof of concept. Because I am certain it is but have no means to show it."
loadingicon,28u2ue,LaboratoryOne,1 point,Mon Jun 23 18:16:42 2014 UTC,"I think I saw other people mentioning they spotted a ying-yang in there as well, but that's not really how it works. I just added a new gif clarifying this. On the ones where I stretched out the sine waves more, it comes close to the look of the opposite half-circles in a ying-yang, but a simple rotating ying-yang would be a totally different animation.  And you DO have means to show it! you could be making stuff like this in processing in weeks, and /r/processing is there to help anytime!"

loadingicon,28snkr,Tokani,2,Mon Jun 23 02:23:43 2014 UTC,Factory reset only erases your settings. You'll need to re-flash your rom. (probably by re-downloading it)

In the end I finally managed to get everything fixed so it's all good.
loadingicon,28snkr,Tokani,2,Mon Jun 23 05:39:50 2014 UTC,"I've also had issues with some loading animations, that's why I always back up the old one like this:  adb pull /system/media/bootanimation.zip   then restore it like this:  adb push bootanimation.zip /system/media/bootanimation.zip   To avoid the issue you encountered, I'd recommend installing bootanimation.zip to /data/local, which does not require root and takes precedence over the one in /system/media (usually the stock one), which will be removed if you wipe /data (as in a factory reset, for example.  This approach is much easier, faster and perhaps safer than using a third party tool, but it does require you to be comfortable with command line interfaces. adb (Android Debug Bridge) is a powerful and extremely convenient tool, and I love the shit out of it."

loadingicon,27y7qp,Alligatronica,3,Fri Jun 13 21:08:41 2014 UTC,"I know a number of the artists posting original content are creating their pieces programmatically using Processing. Processing is a stripped-down, high-level, visuals-centric programming language with its own development environment. You can download Processing from their website and it's more or less free, they just ask for a donation. All the documentation is on the website, and they provide a number of tutorials for all of the basic shape stuff.  Processing is fairly simple to use, but might require a bit of prior programming knowledge. Also, I'm under the impression it could get kinda mathsy, if you want to do anything particularly interesting.  I've been meaning to give it a go since I have a smidge of experience with Processing, but I've just never got around to it.  Good luck!"

Originally Rage Valley was set to be released before the end of April, but due to multiple setbacks the release was delayed for four weeks. A music video for ""Centipede"" was released on 8 August 2012.

I know you probably mean a different thing; but just in case: Processing (or any other programming language / environment for that matter) does not have a built-in ""smoothness"". Processing is a programming language; you can get things to move as smooth as anything your eyes could ever hope to see, provided that you apply the proper maths to your motion code.  But I agree that most people do not go through the pain of the extra effort, so choppy motion looks like it is the fault of the system it is programmed on (which is not the case)."

It occurs because lenses have different refractive indices for different wavelengths of light (the dispersion of the lens). The refractive index decreases with increasing wavelength.   Chromatic aberration manifests itself as ""fringes"" of color along boundaries that separate dark and bright parts of the image, because each color in the optical spectrum cannot be focused at a single common point. Since the focal length f of a lens is dependent on the refractive index n, different wavelengths of light will be focused on different positions.

loadingicon,27a5cp,pinumbernumber,18,Wed Jun 4 19:10:57 2014 UTC,"A quick rundown:  The elipse strokes are made with shape layers.  sceenshot 1  basically I started with one shape layer, added an ellipse and a stroke on the ellipse. then I added a radial wipe to it and keyframed it. Then I used some expressions and created a controller NULL with sliders to be able to make duplicates of the shape layer that would automatically shrink and fit inside the ellipse that's above it, be able to control the size of the shape layers and the thickness of the stroke with slider controls while maintaining the relative distance the same. This means that the strokes would always stick together and appear to be one solid object. The expressions basically uses the layer index number and the stroke width to calculate how much pixels it should subtract from the scale. the expression on the radial wipe makes it able to change the 2nd keyframe value with a slider  screenshot 2  Then I made a cube out of 3D solids. I used a cam with a high zoom factor to mimic a isometric cam (to avoid lens distortion). the solids are placed in 3D space to create a cube, then I precomped the solids and on the precomp activated the collapse transformation to maintain 3D control. After that I animated the cube.  screenshot 3  After that I used 3 circles (used true comp duplicator and only changed the wipe completion %) to match the angle of the cube. I used the cube as color reference. The transition from the circle comp to the cube was made with a simple elipse mask."

I tried to karmadecay search it, but nothing came up even though I know it has been posted on reddit before.  Anyway, this is an example of how humans see color!  CMY are the subtractive primary colors, which form RGB as the secondary subtractive colors.  These are opposed to your primary/secondaries in art, which are the additive colors.  Just a bit of daily physics to go along with your /r/loadingicon experience, haha."
loadingicon,271qau,canausernamebetoolon,4,Sun Jun 1 18:55:39 2014 UTC,"I love the gif, and I'm usually to indifferent to comment on reddit, but this looks like additive colour to me.  There are red, green and blue spots moving. When they all overlap they make white, making them addative, when only two combine, they make one of the three subtractive colours: cyan, magenta and yellow (if we think in terms of printers the black is also represented in the gaps).  Either way, pedantry ends here, love the gif and subbed to /r/loadingicon"
loadingicon,271qau,EnviousNoob,2,Mon Jun 2 01:22:54 2014 UTC,"Well, I could be wrong.  However, additive colors combine to make brown(/black), not white.  Subtractive colors are all about filtering colors from white light, which is the prescene of all colors. The colors seem to be combining, but they are still filtered portions of white light.  That is what makes then subtractive.  Red green and blue cannot be additive primaries regardless--the additive primaries are red blue and yellow.  Red green and blue are the cones in our eyes, which also supports the subtractive color theory.  Thanks!"

loadingicon,271qau,bcoll,3,Mon Jun 2 06:06:10 2014 UTC,"Yep. Red, blue and yellow are one of the subtractive colour palettes and they mix to brown. CMYK is the subtractive palette used in print. RGB is additive. Ink = subtractive, light = additive.  The reason it's called additive is because they combine to white. Red + green = yellow, R + B + G = white, etc.  I hope OP figures this out, it's basic."

(Constitution of Ukraine, Article 20)  As a national flag, the blue and yellow bicolour was officially used since the 1848 Spring of Nations when it was hoisted over the Lviv Rathaus. It is was officially adopted as a state flag for the first time in 1918 by the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic. During the Soviet occupation, the flag was outlawed and before 1949 there was no official state flag until adoption of the red-blue flag of the Ukrainian SSR. People who were hoisting the blue-yellow flags in the Soviet Ukraine were prosecuted as criminals. The blue and yellow flag was provisionally adopted for official ceremonies in September 1991 following Ukrainian independence, before finally officially being restored in 1992.  Ukraine celebrates Flag Day each year on August 23 since 2004.

loadingicon,25cpqe,jamieflournoy,2,Sun May 18 17:09:14 2014 UTC,"Dopamine:       Dopamine (contracted from 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a hormone and neurotransmitter of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families that plays a number of important roles in the human brain and body. Its name derives from its chemical structure: it is an amine that is formed by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of L-DOPA.  In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by nerve cells to send signals to other nerve cells. The brain includes several distinct dopamine systems, one of which plays a major role in reward-motivated behavior. Most types of reward increase the level of dopamine in the brain, and a variety of addictive drugs increase dopamine neuronal activity. Other brain dopamine systems are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of several other important hormones.  Several important diseases of the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in the midbrain area called the substantia nigra. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and the antipsychotic drugs that are frequently used to treat it have a primary effect of attenuating dopamine activity. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are also believed to be associated with decreased dopamine activity.

loadingicon,2591ri,flying-sheep,12,Sun May 11 02:42:55 2014 UTC,"Some tips:   If at all possible, do such things in vector graphics, e.g. use Inkscape for SVGs. It requires a bit rethinking, because the building blocks are still there, e.g. this image would be a path filled with blue and a ring filled with a radial gradient, not pixels looking like that. And to change things, you actually have to select the building blocks, not some kind of layers that you can draw into. If you do transformations on raster graphics (like you did), always start with the initial state, and do one  transformation from it. So in your case always take the initial frame and rotate it by more degrees in each subsequent frame. So instead of rotating step 2 by 5 degrees to get steep three, rotate step 1 by 2×5 instead."

A very similar, slightly more complicated form of that, called ""Rose"", was part of the original After Dark screensavers, of flying toaster fame. ""Rose"" was my favorite and was the trigger that got me into learning about the Lissajous function, the basis of the motion of the dots.  Here's a YouTube video of ""Rose"", but the speed is turned up very high, and the resolution and/or codec are low-enough quality to the point you can't really make out the individual dots. Play it at 0.25x speed and that gets close to the attractive settings, but the video compression kind of ruins it.   I tried making a VM and running my old After Dark software on it, but apparently the speed controls were cpu-bound rather than timer-bound, and they went too blindingly fast, even when I cranked the VM CPU settings down. I've also toyed with the idea of making a modern version of it for probably 15 years now, but never did. It's just that so much more awesome looking stuff is available now."

Following the original, new editions were introduced including More After Dark and Before Dark, as well as editions themed around licensed properties such as Star Trek, The Simpsons, Looney Tunes and Walt Disney Company characters.  The screensaver modules were often noted for their intertextuality, such as the flying toasters appearing in the Fish screensaver, and the cat from Boris screensaver appearing in the Bad Dog screensaver.  As well as the included animated screensavers, it allowed the development and use of third-party modules, of which many hundreds were created by the height of After Dark's popularity.

loadingicon,24jwxp,DoubleFelix,3,Fri May 2 18:17:08 2014 UTC,"CMYK isn't actually what makes it subtractive, though. Subtractive color is colors darkening when mixed together (as with pigments, represented in this GIF). Additive color is colors brightening when mixed together (as with light).  At least in the case of those parenthetical examples, it has to do with reflected VS emitted light. When light bounces off of something, some of it is absorbed and the rest is reflected. Red pigment reflects red light, absorbs other hues. Yellow pigment reflects yellow light, absorbs other hues. But if you mix red and yellow pigments? It absorbs a broader range of the light that hits it, reflecting less of it. Subtracting from it. Whereas adding more light just makes things brighter."
loadingicon,24jwxp,Satsuz,2,Fri May 9 18:38:26 2014 UTC,"Yep. And then if you look at the RGB color codes, you find this:    R = FF0000  G = 00FF00  B = 0000FF    C = 00FFFF  M = FF00FF  Y = FFFF00    So, cyan is just white with the red taken out, etc. If you combine Cyan and Magenta, you take out both the Red and Green, you end up with just Blue left over. So you could print blue by printing Cyan over Magenta."
loadingicon,24jwxp,DoubleFelix,1 point,Fri May 9 18:49:23 2014 UTC,"That's exactly right. I got a little carried away with my clarifications, but the major point is that the bases don't matter as long as they cover all of the different parts of the spectrum. CMYK is a color model for subtractive color, but not the *only subtractive color model. It's just for (most) printwork."

loadingicon,2380no,JViz,2,Thu Apr 17 08:08:51 2014 UTC,That depends on your perspective.

loadingicon,2380no,JViz,1 point,Thu May 8 23:38:37 2014 UTC,Isn't that just semantics?
loadingicon,2380no,KillerRaccoon,3,Fri May 9 00:01:24 2014 UTC,"Nope. They don't have a velocity as such, just a certain amount of energy that places them in their levels. If you prepared two identical boron atoms and looked for a specific electron, you would be just as likely to find it on one side of the nucleus as the other. So they are in what many call ""orbits,"" but they do not orbit."
loadingicon,2380no,JViz,1 point,Fri May 9 00:05:35 2014 UTC,In order to behave as particles they would have to have features of particles. Just because we can't measure those features doesn't mean they don't exist. How would you even be able to tell two separate electrons apart?
loadingicon,2380no,KillerRaccoon,1 point,Fri May 9 03:47:53 2014 UTC,"The particle behavior only exhibits itself upon direct observation of the particle, IE if it happens to ""hit"" a detector (meaning if it statistically happens to be there). Look up Schrodinger's cat. Basically, they statistically ""exist"" everywhere in their orbit. You bring a good thing up about being able to tell electrons apart, because you can't. However, you can measure where, on average, electrons are detected with a specific quantum energy."
loadingicon,2380no,JViz,1 point,Fri May 9 04:00:39 2014 UTC,"Wave/particle duality is my whole point. Even though it exists everywhere in it's orbit, if you treat it like a particle it has to have an orbit, even though we can't actually observe it's orbit."
loadingicon,2380no,KillerRaccoon,1 point,Fri May 9 05:48:04 2014 UTC,"You aren't supposed to treat it as a particle though. It behaves as a wave until you measure it, at which point it collapses. Treating it as a particle only works for the Bohr model of Hydrogen, because it is such a simple atom. Anything above that, and trying to model them as particles gives you very wrong results."

loadingicon,20xi4y,JASH_DOADELESS_,2,Sun Jun 8 20:03:18 2014 UTC,I have decided it may not be the best place for it after all =P
loadingicon,20xi4y,JASH_DOADELESS_,1 point,Sun Jun 8 21:57:19 2014 UTC,Feel free not to x-post it.

loadingicon,20xif7,DeBryceIsRight,1 point,Fri Mar 21 04:53:48 2014 UTC,...or you could just click the link.
loadingicon,20xif7,DeBryceIsRight,2,Fri Mar 21 15:11:09 2014 UTC,"It was just because the website doesn't allow you to easily save the gif. If you right click on it, it just acts like a blank part on the website and doesn't let you save it."
