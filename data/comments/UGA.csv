Also rumor has it that if you walk through the arch before you graduate, you will not graduate.   Of course there's also the football stadium but I'm not sure if that's too cliche for your project. Although UGA football is a huge deal.  Also not really UGA landmark, but you should check out The Tree that Owns itself. It's just a few blocks from campus off of Baxter street. It's said that the owner of the land used to play on this tree when he was young and loved it so much that he left the tree to itself in his will. The tree is marked off and has a cool plaque.

UGA,3dvqbr,a1j9o94,15,Mon Jul 20 02:45:13 2015 UTC,"Throwing away all pretense here. Not racist, not Greek, take my words as they are and nothing more.  Yes, there is a stigma. Greek life is really a good ol' boys club, for the top tier frats. If your heart is set on SAE, Sig Chi or something like that, prepare to be crushed.  That said, you have a good shot at a handful of frats if you are a good-looking, light-skinned dude. If you're too black, all traditional frats will reject you. But if you have a Drake-esque complexion, I'm sure you could get a bid from Phi Tau (I know a light-skinned dude in here), ZBT and maybe one or two others.   But don't sweat it if you don't end up getting a bid. There are so many ways to make friends here at UGA. I'm sure you'll make 1,000 in your dorm alone.   Good luck!"

Literally all that mattered to us was if you fit in with us as a group. I know the gcsu chapter had black guys as well and that was a much smaller school.   Asked my fiancée (she was in Sigma Kappa) and she said most of the fraternities she associated with through parties and socials had black guys too with the exception of kappa alpha that she could recall.   The bottom line is be yourself and try and make some friends when you rush. If you find a lot of guys in a fraternity that you like, and that seem to get along with you, you will not be overlooked for a bid because of something as silly as your Drake-esque complexion (wtf?)."

I did not rush at UGA nor am I black, but I've heard from many sorority girls and fraternity guys that it can be difficult. I am more aware about sororities having to meet a 'quota' so to speak to diversify and some getting into trouble for obviously not admitting different races. Even as far as bars downtown go, my black friend used her ID to get into General's (name is properly General Beauregard's) and was suspiciously denied, even though she was 21 and the bar was not at capacity. I think fraternities are more relaxed, but how much more, I am not sure. http://infusionmagazine.com/2015/04/20/uga-greek-life-silence-rumors-race-and-misogyny-2/ There's a recent article published, which may provide some insight.  http://www.redandblack.com/uganews/greeklife/the-other-side-of-the-paddle-one-sorority-member-talks/article_018cbe86-2e37-11e4-a8a8-0017a43b2370.html  << There is one published by the school newspaper.

UGA,3dvqbr,Interdimension,2,Mon Jul 20 20:52:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not in a frat, but take the observation fwiw; this school is still only ~6/7% black, and yes that makes a difference. A lot of the top tier frats and sororities will be overwhelmingly white, ~90% plus. Even if a person of color makes it in to one, I cannot imagine s/he will feel that comfortable (serious DuBois level double consciousness and the like). Yes, there are exceptions, and no the school does not have an overwhelming problem with racism, but many of the students come from ""historic"" southern families in very white neighborhoods, having attended very white schools. The Greek life at UGA is a microcosm of the stratified modern south, imho."
UGA,3dvqbr,chacohen,5,Tue Jul 21 15:40:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if the preppy Greek thing is your thing I would say go for it! But also, Greek people tend to be more racist or like, racially insensitive, I guess you could call it. According to some Yak, there was this girl who got kicked out of a sorority for dating a black. But I do know a guy who's a Hispanic who's in a frat, but sometimes with him, he feels like he's the token diverse friend and not really a part of it. But if you really are into that frat stuff, I would say don't let being black stop you.   EDIT: I looked at your comment history, and I have to say if you're gay too, brah, that's rough. The very big sister in me tell you not to do it, they might be a bit bad towards black, but they usually HATE gay guys, and might physically hurt you. I would suggest against it. But that being said there are A LOT of other clubs and such you can be a part of at UGA, and both of those aspects about yourself are welcome."

UGA,3dgh3g,YourFriendlyWhiteGuy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:46:52 2015 UTC,"If you know what classes you're taking, get yourself to the Main Library and see if the textbooks are available.

UGA,3dgh3g,mayor_of_townsville,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:26:12 2015 UTC,"I wait until there is some kind of homework ir reading assignment from the text book.  Then first, I do some googling ""textbook name pdf"" and I do some careful clicking to avoid viruses. So far so good.   But if it doesnt work out, or you dont think you'll like a digital book, amazon is my goto place. Have a look at the used copies and renting. See which is cheaper. If you will only use it one semester, then renting is better imo. You get the book and then get rid of the book after the semester. If you'll need it multiple semesters, or know someone who you could sell it to afterwards (considering they dont change the book) used is the way to go if possible.   Getting books from the bookstore is usually expensive, but you should still go and double check used and rental prices against what is on amazon.   If you can find them from upperclassmen and they'll give you a deal, do that for sure. I just have never had luck with that  And a bit of additional advice, if you need to buy webassign membership or stuff like that, going direct through the website has worked out cheaper. Mainly because the membership codes through the bookstore run for the entire year rather than the semester only.   Basically, anything that you have to spend money on, investigate every source and compare. Test the waters with books and see if you can avoid them (I havent used books for most classes. Or ive used like 3 pages from them.)"

We actually do run the air during peak hours, because otherwise our house would be 90 degrees. When the air is on, it runs nonstop because it can't actually get the house down to the temperature we've set the thermostat to (that's how bad the insulation is).  Anyway, our power bills are close to $300 over the summer.   You live in a newer house (apartment?), but you do have 6 people living there. That's a big place to keep cool. I'm assuming your unit has to work pretty hard to keep the temperature reasonable even if you do have it set at 78.

UGA,3d11e1,Jason-Perry,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:44:06 2015 UTC,"I'm a mechanical engineer and Certified Energy Manager, and I do energy conservation projects for UGA. $300 is plausible for a 6-person dwelling considering the weather we've had recently, but here's some things to think about to hopefully bring that down.  One thing to keep in mind is that you're probably on a residential rate plan, so peak hours don't cost more for you like they do for commercial and industrial customers. However, the hotter it is outside the less efficient your AC gets, so your avoiding peak hours isn't a bad idea. Also, summer rates do go up even for residential customers. Take a look at the ""fuel cost recovery fee"" on your bill, this is where that increase is reflected. It's linear, i.e. it's a few cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) added to your charge.  Six people, eh? How many TVs do you have there, and do you have electric hot water? A 30"" flat screen can pull at least 250 watts. Are you hanging out inside watching the tube more this month? Or, are you outside getting sweaty and taking more showers than when it's cooler?  It is possible that your AC unit hasn't been maintained. A dirty filter will reduce its effectiveness. A refrigerant leak will absolutely cause it to run inefficiently and expensively. If there is ice built up on the refrigerant line on the outdoor unit this may mean you have low refrigerant.  Someone here mentioned ""zombie devices."" This is largely based on chargers from the 90s that drew power even when not charging something. Your modern phone, laptop, and tablet chargers should not draw power when your devices aren't connected, but you can check by touching them: if they're warm when plugged in but no device is connected then they're wasting energy. Devices that are waiting for a signal, such as anything with a remote (TVs, gaming systems, some stereos) or wifi devices like wireless printers do use some power even when ""off"" or asleep.

I'm sure it will be fairly crowded that Friday, though."

UGA,3ckw8l,redgirl329,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:19:48 2015 UTC,"With looking for fifteen tickets, you're going to have a hard time getting even the same general section for everyone.   Stub hub is definitely the way to go if you'd all like to sit together. Upper level will definitely be more likely to sit together... But still, you may run into some assholes who are unwilling to be flexible. God knows I have.   Crowds are going to be insane the night before and the night of. Don't be stupid and know where you're going and keep track of your group. Athens can be a playground but downtown backs up to some verifiably sketchy places.   Traffic is absolutely crazy on 316. Get there the day before and leave the day after or well after the game is over."
UGA,3ckw8l,rbaile28,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:13:16 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with people suggesting tailgating on North Campus. UGA has all of these extreme rules in order to keep NC clean and to preserve the historic part of the University.   Myers Quad is the centerpiece for tailgating, and I just prefer South Campus tailgates in general. The party gets started at 7AM there and it doesn't stop until long after the game ends. In all honesty though, you can't go wrong anywhere as long as you're wearing the right colors. Show up, call the dawgs, and shotgun a beer and you're in the clear."
UGA,3ckw8l,belay_is_on,-1,Thu Jul 9 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"Finding that many tickets together will be a challenge for any game, nevermind an SEC contest vs. Spurrier.  For tailgating, stick to north campus near the arch. There are tons of bars downtown too. You'll want to find out when the Dawg Walk is the day of the game. It's usually 2 hours before kickoff and is a giant sea of red and black. A lot of fun for first-timers. Apart from walking around campus, downtown, and the Terrapin Tour, there's not a ton to do in Athens (it's a small college town). But the nightlife is amazing and there are always great bands playing every night.   You might want to hit up Atlanta for more distractions. Without traffic, you can get there in 45 minutes."

I tend to only drop max and missed reps. I'm 6'5"", so when I drop something from overhead, it's noticeable. Nobody has ever said anything to me.  There are lots of dudes there who are poorly power cleaning way more than they should and dropping every fucking rep. Nobody says anything.  So you should be fine at Ramsey. There are currently 4 platforms with bumper plates (each with an attached squat rack), another smaller platform. And two stand alone squat racks. There are also about 4 bars suitable for oly lifts. All in all, it's a decent alternative to buying your own home gym, which is what I'm doing next month.  Omni has a crossfit knockoff class you can pay out the ass for. There are also 2?

UGA,3c9m83,MattWalkerGA,7,Mon Jul 6 04:19:44 2015 UTC,"First off, welcome!   For a spring admit, I'd have to say the chances of you getting a single dorm are fairly slim as most of them are leased for both semesters. However, if you apply for housing the first day available with the deposit, you can get the best chance possible for any housing situation. IIRC, Rutherford is an Honors dorm with upper classman priority so getting in here is also a slim chance even if you came in the fall. It's a mix of sophomores-seniors with a few freshmen who somehow made it in there. I definitely wouldn't bank on getting Rutherford as it's arguably the most sought out dorm for pretty much everyone living on campus and it isn't all that large compared to most of the dorms. Living with someone else really isn't that big of a deal, like many people will tell you it's all about communication. You don't have to love your roommate, you just have to be compatible for living with them which is a lot easier than it sounds if both parties communicate and aren't awful people. Dorm life is fun, but realize you probably won't be in your room all that much (Class, SLC, Gym, Dining halls, Anywhere outside, DT, etc.)   Being a spring admit, you'll more than likely be replacing the drop outs/semester offs/study abroads in the dorms. So you'll have limited options outside of ECV(?), but ECV also has very nice dorms.   Someone else can correct me if they see fitted!"

UGA,3bjd1u,kayyyyyyyyqueeeeee,4,Mon Jun 29 18:26:38 2015 UTC,"Cadet here, will try to answer what I can.   SMP is the Simultaneous Member Program. Basically, you're both in the National Guard or Reserve as well as a cadet in ROTC. I'm not too sure on the specifics, but what it boils down to is you're a cadet on campus, so during the week you do college student and cadet stuff, and once a month you go to drill. At drill, you're supposed to be shadowing an officer, I believe a lieutenant, and basically learning how to be one. In addition to your regular ROTC pay, you're also getting drill pay and those allowances. I'm not quite sure, but I don't think you have to do basic in order to do SMP.   As for how much time ROTC takes up, it's really not too bad until you get to your third and fourth year of it. A typical day will start with PT at 6AM and PT will last an hour. On Thursday afternoons, we have a tactical lab that lasts three to four hours. Other than that, you're pretty much a college student. On occasion, we do have other stuff to do, such as volunteer work with the local JROTC or helping Boy Scouts learn land navigation or even helping out with pre game events for football games. We also do field training every so often, and for that we'll either take a week or a weekend to go to the field. Once you get to the third and fourth year, ROTC is much more time demanding, simply because you are now in charge of the battalion. That means all the planning and execution is on your shoulders now. In addition to that, ROTC demands that you take an ROTC course every semester. For the first two years, it's a two hour course, with a lab, so three hours total. The last two years, it's a three hour course and a lab, for four hours. The classes really aren't that bad, and all of our cadre are really cool. You'll definitely learn stuff in the classes and a lot of it is applicable to your daily life.   If you want to balance ROTC and a job, you certainly can. I did it last year while doing food service. There's nothing stopping you, and you do get some extra cash in your pocket. You'll see that ROTC does try and take care of your financial stuff for you. If you contract, ROTC pays for either tuition or housing. In addition, you get a grocery stipend, a book stipend, and a living stipend. The living stipend starts at I think $300 a month and goes up each year. Not actually 100% sure on the number, so don't quote me. The way ROTC pays you is as a massive lump sum, so if you don't end up using all of it, that cash goes straight into your pocket. I certainly didn't use all of my book stipend on books because the only book I needed to get cost me fifty bucks. In addition, ROTC encourages you take ""critical language"" classes, like Arabic or Chinese. If you do take those classes, you'll get paid a extra, so it's a nice way to get paid and get rid of some university requirements.   As for me, I like ROTC. I'm sure that I would love to be able to sleep in some more, but I'm sure pretty much all college students are used to being tired. It's also nice to be able to get up in the morning and realize you have a whole bunch of time left in the day.   I can guarantee that you'll meet a bunch of cool people though. We're a pretty friendly and helpful group of people.   I hope this helps. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask."

UGA,3bjd1u,SicEm80,3,Tue Jun 30 18:50:07 2015 UTC,"Yep.   As an added bonus, if you want to do colorguard in ROTC, we can usually get you into games for free. And on the sidelines!"

UGA,3bjd1u,SicEm80,2,Tue Jun 30 21:01:08 2015 UTC,"Smp is where you are in the guard/reserves and in Rotc. After/if you get contracted as a cadet you will have to do pt from like 6-8am 3 days a week (I think) and a few hours a week for lab (Thursday afternoons I think). For the reserves you will have to go to drill one weekend a month and 2 weeks for annual training (usually in the summer time). Most of the smp cadets I know went to basic and Ait so that's an additional few months. Balancing Rotc and school with work will be difficult but far from impossible. Between drill pay, Gi Bill, and other additional pay another part time job shouldn't be needed. I'm not quite sure about the specifics of things. Been in the guard for a few years but never was in ROTC."

It's actually pretty great if you have morning classes because it is the starting point for Orbit and East Campus Express. I would reccommend registering for the lot with the parking deck, because when it is cold during the winter and fall instead of waiting outside in the cold for your bus, you can hop on one of the buses that are already there waiting for their route to start. Depending on what part of campus you'll be going to, you'll almost always want to take East Campus Express. (yes, it is better to wait for an ECE, than hop on the Orbit if it comes first... 95% of the time). And depending on how late you stay on campus and how frequently. That East-West route during the night takes awhile. You won't want to rely on that regularly."

UGA,3avw6k,batmanrodriguez,2,Tue Jun 23 23:38:43 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure you can take it in the spring but take a step back here.   You could switch a class out and the FYOS in so you could have a bit easier transition to college your first semester
UGA,3avw6k,mscullin75,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:50:59 2015 UTC,"I asked my advisor about it. Although you can technically choose to take your FYOS course in the spring, it's not recommended because there will be much less courses offered at that time. If you don't mind that fact, however, feel free to do so.  You can also just take PE first semester instead of FYOS, since you need to get it out of the way before graduation anyway."
UGA,3avw6k,Interdimension,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:52:03 2015 UTC,"There are less offered (I had to take mine in the spring because I was deferred 'till spring) I absolutely hated my class and I personally didn't feel like it was any remotely helpful transition into college.

UGA,3aucjd,KarthusJungle,2,Tue Jun 23 16:05:10 2015 UTC,"1) In my experience, I heavily rely on ratemyprofessors and also, Koofers, to pick my teachers. There really are easy and hard professors for the same class. However, a few classes are just simply very difficult and the professor will not matter.   2) It's possible, but if you find a professor with about 5+ good or bad reviews, I think that's enough to make an overall opinion of the professor.  3) Really try to take a full-time student courseload each semester (12 hours). A lot of students take 15 and are fine, so I'm sure 12 will be manageable.   4) Maybe I'm not understanding this right, but I would not advise retaking a class that you already have credit for. Some easy social science classes I know of include GEOG 1101, POLS 1101, PSYC 1101, and RELI 1101. Any 1101 really.  5) No one's trying to shove booze down your throat. The amount of alcohol you see is dependent on who you associate with. Yes, the majority of students will drink, but many don't, so if you truly want to avoid it, choose your friends wisely. You'll come to understand drinking life here once you're around for a while, then make a decision.  Feel free to PM if you have any more specifics."

UGA,3aucjd,1omelet,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:13:16 2015 UTC,"Pretty damn efficient, but also realize that you're more likely to write a review if you did poorly as opposed to doing well because you want to rant. It takes like 2 minutes so I'd say it's worth it. Just use ratemyprofessor ror koofers I was in your situation also but got a little more boned because I didn't go the pharmD route so I'm stuck taking the chemistries and some bogus electives because I'm out of everything else. You aren't in as bad of a situation because you still have bio/anatomy and whatnot to take, but realize you can't take biochem or micro until you take ochem 1.    So you'd probably do something like this:  fall 2015 - chem 1 (anatomy?)  spring 2016 - chem 2/bio 1 (chem 1 is prereq for bio 1)  fall 2016 o chem 1/bio 2  spring 2017 o chem 2 bcmb/micro (no lab)  Throw the other anatomy somewhere and you're good, it's still an intro class so it shouldn't be too bad. I'm pretty sure this is a common route most PharmD's take whether or not they have AP credit; it's a pretty common route for any life science major also.    I wouldn't retake social sciences unless you literally have nothing to take... and even then I would look at things that pique your interest (psyc? but even then you can look at the more specified psyc classes which I find interesting). But if you wish, geog/geol 1101 are both easy. Psyc 1101 is not awful, but it's enough work to make you go to class (I loved this class). POLS 1101 if you find government interesting. There are also some bio seminars you can take if you find those fun! Also look into LING 2100.  Personally I'd stay away from SOCI, ENGL, & COMM (some may argue COMM) because I feel like a lot of the times it depends on if you get a solid professor or not. Also I wouldn't do HIST unless you love reading.   I would think you'd rather take some upper level classes/seminars that you may find interesting over retaking any class though.   If you don't want to drink at all it shouldn't be an issue. There are phi slam parties which are sober I believe which are fun(?). Also a ton of people are like you so y'all will make friends and there is plenty to do sober. You'll have a good time, don't worry.    Drinking is only really an issue if you are on the fence, because people are going out left and right every night so you may be pressured into going out. But if you find yourself strong, you'll be fine."
UGA,3aucjd,ErwinsZombieCat,2,Tue Jun 23 17:52:01 2015 UTC,"Woah thanks for the in-depth answer! I have a lot of things to ask you now!  I honestly had no idea I couldn't take those til I finished ochem! I just was scared of my course load going crazy so I was asking how to split it up! That helps a lot tbh.  Why did you not end up going for pharmD? (If it's not too personal of a question to ask)  That path makes a lot of sense! It helps a lot. But, the problem comes when I am taking two science classes each semester but I run out of the other requirements. (Cause I have only 9 hours of the other classes to take)  Honestly I've never heard of seminar classes and I'll be sure to look them up and see how they fit in/work. They sound fun from what you've said though.   Psych is awesome, it's actually the only AP class I took I didn't take an exam for. So that would be a great extra class!  From your experience should I apply for Honors? I should have done it after I was accepted EA (because some of my friends who I didn't expect to get in got in) Did your peers in honors feel like they did better or worse especially in science classes?  I need to look more into parties like that! But I am not really on the fence, far from it actually, I just have close friends going with me who are planning on getting drunk so it's just kinda scary.  Thanks so much for your help!!"
UGA,3aucjd,ErwinsZombieCat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:41:37 2015 UTC,"Being in Honors isn't a huge deal in science classes. BCMB graduate and the honors option just meant writing an extra paper at end of semester. I know the PharmD is appealing, but I know plenty of people who started and ended getting their liberal arts degree instead. Be open when you come to college and understand that this a period of growth and learning. Please do not come just to get your 2 years and leave. UGA is a wonderful school and a well-rounded liberal arts degree will help you so much in life."
UGA,3aucjd,1omelet,2,Tue Jun 23 21:40:08 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know what Liberal Arts degree means. It is so vague, I look into it but it just makes me more confused at what it actually is. I agree, I think I will end up exploring more than I plan. I was actually planning on going to UGA pharm school if I got in :P  Thanks for the advice!"
UGA,3aucjd,grokas,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:59:34 2015 UTC,"If I may aid in an explanation, my end goal is to become a professor. Liberal Arts is a sub-section of academia dedicate to creating an environment that will create an intelligent, thinking individual who appreciates Math, Science, Literature, Arts and Music, Social Sciences, and most importantly critical thinking. This individual is more rounded and has a balance of knowledge. Now once you go into Pharmacy school, you will be ready to specialize in a specific field. Liberal Arts aides the individual by introducing them to topics ranging from the exact mechanism for a white blood cell to enter an area through epithelial cells, to why Shakespeare chose Benedick and Beatrice to outshine Hero and Claudio in Much Ado About Nothing, and finally why Freud believed dreams could unlock the conscious. These topics will create a more balanced individual who can critically think about and understand the world we live in."
UGA,3aucjd,peejyluigi,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:45:01 2015 UTC,"That makes a lot more sense, sounds kind of like a more complete in-depth high school experience where you end up a more learned person around the board. Really cool examples, haven't read much Shakespeare but Hamlet was freaking amazing and Freud was one cocaine addicted genius!   Sorry for my ignorance, but it feels like a rather general degree that would certainly benefit someone going into teaching, but what other kind of jobs do Liberal Arts majors do?  Again, thanks for the advice!"
UGA,3aucjd,mallorylovescats,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:57:11 2015 UTC,"You would have figured it out the second you got here haha, it's sequenced for a reason!  I was never planning on going the pharmD route, I considered it but decided to go the full healthcare route with practice (pediatrics) which I think is my calling as opposed to the biochemistry/biophysics behind drugs.   I know you run out, but taking 2 science classes each semester isn't a biggie and is relatively normal; so I think that's just something you'd have to deal with. Most people in the pre-pharmacy path finish in 2-3 years anyway! But wow, seriously you're ahead of the game. I would maybe in that case retake some of your social sciences then, amp up your GPA a little bit (because if it's only based off of your core science classes you may want some padding).  I wasn't in honors, I actually wasn't going to UGA until like May 14th or something so I never had the chance to apply (long story short, I declined my offer of admission for a more fitting school but then couldn't afford it so had to retrace it and get my acceptance back). But I applied after first semester and was denied with a 3.92. So I would almost advise you to do as much as you can to get a 4.0 because the only people I know that got in after first semester had that.   I don't think my peers felt any different, as far as chemistry goes it's easier(?) because they have quite a bit of extra credit; their lab though is more difficult. So it's a trade off. It also wouldn't benefit you entirely because you're pre-pharmacy and won't get the benefit of the ""easier"" honors classes that most people are envious of.   Ah, I can't say I was in your shoes here. I was drunk my fair share of freshman year with little repercussions, but if you drink responsibly (as far as classes, homework, tests, etc. go), you can be just fine.   But as the other reply said, please enjoy your time here. I honestly am counting the days until I can get back to Athens. I'm going back tomorrow for a simple meeting and I'm completely stoked.

UGA,3aubf9,TeamLazershark,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:08:20 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind staying 6 years, you can maybe do it. BCHE has 131 credit hours. You have to take an additional 24 credit hours for the CHEM core classes (I excluded chem1+2, ochem1, biochem1). You also have to complete all of franklin's requirements for the chem degree which is 3 sections of language (12 hours) an extra lit (you can take 1102M instead of 1102 and get away with not taking an extra class) some other junk (18 hours). So in total, you have to take 181 credit hours. I don't know what you came in with or how much you have, but assuming you are coming into next year with 60 hours, thats like 15.125 credit hours every semester for the next 4 years (so 6 years total) if the scheduling works out and you pass everything. I know 15 credit hours is average, but to be fair, I don't think I know any BCHE that are graduating on time.  When I started calculating all that, I thought it would have more overlap. Franklin reqs kill you since the engineering college doesnt have any. Good luck."

You need an up-to-date diagnosis, which is probably the most important. The whole process can be long, fortunately, I did not need it immediately. However, when I mentioned it to professors, most offered accommodations, even beyond what I needed. It might be worthwhile to go ahead and do that while you're waiting.  Once they accept you for it, you have to pick up forms to give to your professors. Most won't require it, but it is helpful in getting those accommodations. I did not have to get help with testing, but generally it involves more time or a private room of some sort. Usually you won't be given a ""hey, give this person a higher grade even though they've given a wrong answer"" but more of a ""this person has such and such, so please focus on content rather than quality"". My accommodations require professors to ignore the quality of my speaking skills and focus on content."
UGA,3an3qc,hmongxboi,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:55:00 2015 UTC,"Wish I could help, but I've graduated and left Athens.  Talk to your professor about dropping the lab portion. I cannot say for sure, but you should be able to drop the lab, complete the lecture, and take the lab portion at a later time if you need it for grad school or something. Lab portions only count towards 1 credit hour. Getting a C- in it wouldn't affect your GPA as badly as getting a C- in a 3 credit hour course. In other words, if you do bomb the lab but do exceedingly well in the lecture, you should be okay. No idea about this one. However, if you feel your GAD is hindering your performance in school, I'd suggest seeking out CAPS (counseling and psychiatric services) at the health center. Sessions are subsidized if you paid the health center fee.    As far as the material goes, don't feel bogged down by it. First of all, you're taking it over the summer so they're already going quickly through the material in lecture and lab, and second, the gen chems at UGA are notoriously difficult. I'd say there's a positive correlation between doing well in lecture and doing well in lab. I think you are just getting psyched out in lab and if you can get past it you'll be fine. Generally, the labs are usually the ""easier"" portions of science classes. Best of luck."

HOPE also checks your GPA after every 30 hour credit/spring semester, so it's likely that you'd still have time to raise your GPA."

They can all accommodate you and make sure you have a place to sleep and food to eat.   This also all depends on what kind of fraternity you want.

My suggestion is to email the professors in the LDT department with these questions. If that feels intimidating, email the doc students.   When I was first considering applying, I found the idea of directly contacting those people to be intimidating, and I thought that they might judge me for being unsure and ignorant. Completely the opposite. The people whom I have contacted have been informed, accommodating, and understanding."
UGA,3a8nml,SleepsontheGround,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:46:59 2015 UTC,Hey there.  I am actually in the LDT masters program right now.  PM me.
UGA,3a52ao,5throwaway02,20,Wed Jun 17 07:56:15 2015 UTC,Hey. CAPS at the UGA health center is an amazing place with amazing people*. They've helped me a lot. Feel free to PM me.
UGA,3a52ao,nikkid07,11,Wed Jun 17 11:52:19 2015 UTC,"Also, the Center for Counseling and Personal Evaluation in Aderhold (4th Floor) frequently gets referrals when CAPS is booked.  They don't take insurance but its like $10-$15 a session, which is stupid good."
UGA,3a52ao,MrSoprano,4,Wed Jun 17 14:28:09 2015 UTC,CAPS really helped me too. They gave me legit advice on how to progress forward with my life. I'm very thankful.
UGA,3a52ao,Scouting4Bacon,9,Wed Jun 17 20:29:30 2015 UTC,"CAPS will not be full right now. Go there, call there, it's okay, it will get better."
UGA,3a52ao,Yankton,21,Wed Jun 17 15:11:27 2015 UTC,"If you are a student at UGA, there are many good resources available to you. Reach out to the health center. Also, there's always the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255 if you just need someone to talk to to get you through the night or a bad day. If I wasn't on my phone, I'd search some subreddits to also give you where you can find whole communities of people going through exactly what you are."
UGA,3a52ao,redgirl329,8,Wed Jun 17 08:18:54 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I know it probably took a lot to post this here so I wanted to say thank you.   I know how hard it is to make thst first step to get help. Caps is a good place with caring therapists. If you've paid the summer health fee, the rates are very reasonable.   Good luck and keep fighting the good fight."
UGA,3a52ao,engine4death,8,Wed Jun 17 15:29:50 2015 UTC,"I know everyone has said this, but go to CAPS. You can probably walk in right now. I go every week."
UGA,3a52ao,archeusdevine,6,Wed Jun 17 17:21:55 2015 UTC,"Caps is amazing. Just remember so many people love you even though you may not think so. I've been there man, it's rough but I promise things will get better.  If you want a hug let me know."
UGA,3a52ao,flamingopinknutsack,4,Wed Jun 17 17:31:41 2015 UTC,"My room mate found a lot of help through CAPS.  Hope you feel better, OP."
UGA,3a52ao,ToughSpaghetti,3,Wed Jun 17 20:40:06 2015 UTC,I've had good experience with Dr. Patricia Brawner. Look her up.
UGA,3a52ao,envader,3,Wed Jun 17 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"http://gracepsychotherapy.com/  It is out off 78, and Dr Grace is a good and patient man.  My insurance covers it all with no co-pay.  Do you need meds too, because I can also recommend a shrink as well."
UGA,3a52ao,fcewen00,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:54:01 2015 UTC,I found him to be incredibly combative and the billing practices were a little strange.
UGA,3a52ao,day_kid_older_sister,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"I don't mind combative.  I don't need a therapist that is going to coddle me, I need one that is going to tell me the truth, because I hate myself and suffer from severe depression and I need that to get through my thick skull."
UGA,3a52ao,fcewen00,2,Fri Jun 19 13:24:57 2015 UTC,"CAPS more or less told me to get lost after they found I wasn't suicidal. Scott Snyder on Prince has been a miracle worker. I can't speak for him and Cigna, but he and his staff are nice people, plus he brings his dog to work sometimes!"
UGA,3a52ao,N776AU,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:39:40 2015 UTC,"Same experience with CAPS totally snubbing me. I ended up institutionalized a couple months later; shame on them. I recommend Fletch McClellan. He's near bishop park and accepts Cigna, or at least 4 yrs ago he did"
UGA,3a52ao,Apensar,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:43:33 2015 UTC,Dr. James Calhoun has worked for me. He's been really supportive of a bunch of tough issues.
UGA,3a5yty,DRTNation,16,Wed Jun 17 14:19:52 2015 UTC,I was able to download 4K porn at like 600 megabits/sec In ECV. Very happy with the wired connection. PAWS WiFi does suck a long one though...
UGA,3a5yty,hondabikefan,14,Wed Jun 17 21:28:55 2015 UTC,Go Dawgs?
UGA,3a5yty,Captainaddy44,6,Wed Jun 17 23:55:40 2015 UTC,"Lived in Creswell. Internet was fine. I even got Xbox live and could stream Netflix or play online games with no issues. Only problem is it disconnecting and reconnecting randomly sometimes, but it's never slow"
UGA,3a5yty,KingSmoke,6,Wed Jun 17 17:52:14 2015 UTC,"In 1516 my freshman year, I was able to get ~500-950 Mbps down (dependent on traffic) and almost always got ~1Gbps up. This is Ethernet, though; Paws Secure is some shit... especially in the freshmen high rises."
UGA,3a5yty,Captainaddy44,3,Wed Jun 17 17:53:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about the actual speeds, but 2 years ago I lived in Myers and the connection was questionable. My room in particular seemed to have a lot of trouble getting Wi-Fi. PAWS-Secure (UGA's network) goes down a lot more than it should. You'll probably be fine overall, but it won't always be great."
UGA,3a5yty,emdesch,8,Wed Jun 17 14:42:23 2015 UTC,"To be fair, this is during orientation when there are zero people in the dorms: http://www.speedtest.net/my-result/4439374415  In reality, you're going to be competing sharing this connection with everyone in your respective dorm, so getting near gigabit probably won't happen. However, on most days, it's going to kick most residential connection speeds directly in the dick.  You should be fine."
UGA,3a5yty,TraceLines,3,Wed Jun 17 14:26:50 2015 UTC,Oh my haha I think I'll still be fine regardless if there are a lot of people on the network.  I get 6.0 mbps down and 0.4 mbps up at my house. So I often find myself driving to various places to upload on their wifi.
UGA,3a5yty,cdawg92,5,Wed Jun 17 18:09:11 2015 UTC,"The UGA library (science library as well) have amazing speeds as well.  Also, if you're a CS major or if you take a CS course to have access to the CS lab, the speeds in there are ridiculous.  I've gotten 800Mb/s in the lab before. Upload speeds will be much slower, though."
UGA,3a5yty,Captainaddy44,5,Wed Jun 17 14:50:24 2015 UTC,800 Mbps*   Just a small correction.
UGA,3a5yty,jordan042,3,Wed Jun 17 17:51:35 2015 UTC,"As long as you avoid the WiFi, it's as fast as anywhere I've ever seen"
UGA,3a5yty,Chaptin,2,Wed Jun 17 19:23:47 2015 UTC,Wifi is non usable. Ethernet is very very good
UGA,3a5yty,JaneDoe91,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:03:00 2015 UTC,"I lived in Payne years ago and could barely if ever connect to paws, but that could have changed."
UGA,3a5yty,dawgwild,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:29:13 2015 UTC,"Actually pretty fast in Russell. Some friends had issues in some of the Hill dorms, but generally not a big deal."
UGA,3a5yty,agent_spooky,0,Tue Jun 23 03:32:21 2015 UTC,"You'll want to bring a cat-6 cable (and probably your own wireless router). As others have said, campus wifi isn't particularly great -- and when you're competing with all the other students, it can get pretty hairy. I had a router for two years in Myers; it was entirely worth it."
UGA,3a5yty,Exilarchy,0,Wed Jun 17 23:36:14 2015 UTC,"Awesome, I think that's what I'll be doing."
UGA,3a5yty,LetTheBigDawgCreep,4,Thu Jun 18 17:05:08 2015 UTC,Don't bring your own wireless router. That just makes it more difficult for everyone else. Just go ahead and wire yourself in and your connection will be great.
UGA,3a5yty,viddyhyun,4,Thu Jun 18 21:23:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he just gave you terrible advice.  EITS will find you when your router fucks things up for your dorm mates.  Rule number one."
