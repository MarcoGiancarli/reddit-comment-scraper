SWORDS,3e4rt0,afacelessvoid,6,Tue Jul 21 23:16:35 2015 UTC,"Was your grandmother involved in any sort of stage or film work?  The first one looks like a Fraternal sword, the kind they use for the Freemasons, Knights of Columbus, etc. They were pretty popular in the early 20th C. and there's a lot of them around in various styles, some of them are quite nice and seem to have a good temper.   I'd guess that the second one is for stage or early film use. I say this because of the crude-looking grip and the handguard that appears to be painted to resemble brass. While one can pick out those details in the close-up photographs. If it were viewed at any distance (say, by sitting in an auditorium or on an actor's hip in the background), it would look quite real. I'm inclined to think it was probably used for a stage production, given the steel blade.   I should add that the first sword may have very well seen this sort of use as well, either being created for that purpose or adapted to it later in its life."
SWORDS,3e4rt0,OrdoCorvus,2,Tue Jul 21 23:58:52 2015 UTC,"The first one looks like a smallsword to me, probably a decorative piece. The second one looks like a late 18th century saber of some form.

Meitō literally means ""named sword"" but the sense in which ""named"" is used could also translate very well to ""notable"" or ""famous"" sword — a sword with a (good) name. Most meitō literally have names, like the Hochō Masamune (three daggers by Masamune which have very broad, kitchen-knife-like blades). The names can reference famous owners, events, poetic metaphors, visual similarities, etc.  The funny thing is, it is very un-Japanese to presume to name your own sword.

For anyone who's read name of the wind, there's an interesting idea of names and power and what that means and by the time you read ""A slow regard of silent things"" You get a feel for what it means to name something. A sword that has a name has power, and a person who names a sword loses their power to it. The Effect of the blade work becomes the blades and not the wielder.

There are 3 ways to sharpen a blade:   Pay someone (this included whatever reseller you are buying it from), and it may not result the most professional sharpening in terms of how it looks. Do it yourself with something like an accusharp, this will get it sharp, but it will look about the same as paying a reseller to do it. Do it yourself with a good whetstone, this takes time and some skill, but it isn't too hard to learn how to do it. I'd suggest practicing some on an old set of kitchen knives before trying on your sword.   edit: I think the 3rd option is the best option."

This sword is in much worse condition and is still listed for nearly $4000.  I did some digging into the maker's marks this morning and couldn't find anything, but I don't really have a good source for that kind of thing.  I feel like I have seen that clover stamp somewhere before, but I can't remember where.    Anyway, as Azekh said, that isn't too far off the price for a decent modern replica.

I didn't like how some of the practical series had faux leather warps so I know I didn't want one of those.   The Raptor Shinogi Zukuri looks interesting, I like the theme of it, but KOA is backordered on it anyway and I'm not sure how the Hanwei in that price range compares to the Ronin Dojo Pro.  Well out of my price range but the Hanwei Oni is also appealing, but I've read that L6/Bainite blades in the $1000 price range probably aren't very good quality?  I don't know much about it but it's suggested that that type of blade should be much more expensive and at that price it's probably not good?"
SWORDS,3du9pm,eel_heron,12,Sun Jul 19 15:14:08 2015 UTC,"I think there is so much debate in this thread because of (putting on my best Matt Easton impression) context.    In the introduction to Swords and Swordsman by Mike Loades he waxes poetic about the sword for quite a while.  He describes it as, ""an object of beauty"", ""the weapon that gives hope that skill can triumph over brute force"", and a ""symbol of rank"".  All of these things are true.  This is what I imagine Peter Johnsson is saying.  Swords have served an important allegorical, symbolic and aesthetic quality for, I would assume, their entire history.  These qualities have even outlived most of the swords actual usefulness as a weapon.  On the other hand, the sword is also a tool of butchery.  Used against many people with absolutely no thought of poetry or symbolism.  The average man carrying a sword throughout history wasn't wearing it as a badge of office, or decoration to his outfit, he was carrying it with the intent of either taking someone's life or protecting his own.  I agree with Mr. Johnsson, the symbolism of the sword is a very important aspect to consider when learning about swords, but others on this subreddit train HEMA for exercise and sport and are only really interested in the martial aspects of it.  It just depends on your perspective."
SWORDS,3du9pm,ThomasFairfax,4,Sun Jul 19 19:53:21 2015 UTC,"Well put, though there was certainly awareness of status and symbolism during the time periods of these swords. When you saw a man with an ornate sword in a particular style walking through town, you immediately knew something about him.   I do believe you're right that there may be some HEMA/WMA folks in this thread who favor the utilitarian side of the sword, but certainly we can discuss the many aspects of the sword and learn from each other.   e: I should also point out for any HEMA/WMA folks who may not be inclined to watch this video, he talks at length about the kinetics, balance/pivot/vibration points (this is especially interesting for combat purposes), edge geometry, why and how swords lose their edge, the reason different swords are shaped and balanced the way they are. etc. Lots of really great, expert stuff about the utilitarian side of the sword. The quote I picked just happen to resonate with me, but he really gives a great nuts and bolts talk. In fact, that's really mostly what he talks about, and maybe I misrepresented it a bit with my title implying it would be heavy on the symbolic aspects. Sorry for that!"
SWORDS,3du9pm,60for30,5,Sun Jul 19 20:01:10 2015 UTC,"As a HEMA dude, if anyone tells you that most of us aren't into the coolness of swords, they're just sensitive to the SCA and reinactment roots of WMA.   The mechanics and composition of swords is part of that, in my mind. There's no disputing that we think it's symbolically awesome, however."

The average man carrying a sword throughout history wasn't wearing it as a badge of office, or decoration to his outfit, he was carrying it with the intent of either taking someone's life or protecting his own.   Not sure I agree with this.  Depending on time and location, several cultures put a lot of effort into the aesthetic refinement of swords.  While it is arguably true that some cultures treated the sword in a more utilitarian fashion, I have a hard time believing that an early medieval Anglo-Saxon or Lombard, sporting an elaborately pattern welded Spatha or later a ""Viking"" with elaborately inlaid sword, was not keenly aware of the symbolic and aesthetic functions of his sword first and foremost.  Certainly in the post-Roman Germanic early medieval, swords were extremely important parts of the gift-giving warrior culture.  A sword was just as likely to be used as a symbolic gift from lord to retainer as it was as a weapon. In fact given how much more vital a spear was in war, I'd argue that the sword functionally used as symbol more than weapon.  To think that a warrior of that period wasn't aware of this symbolism and significance is silly...  Swords like this certainly seem to me to be as much ""man jewelry"" as they are weapon:"
SWORDS,3du9pm,ThomasFairfax,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:43:01 2015 UTC,"It's a hard thing to say specifically, and I will agree that I have neither the credentials nor time to make a rough guess of the average sword user throughout the ages.    A common problem with swords in archaeology is that it is mostly the exemplary samples that survived into a time period where people were keen to document them.  This also takes into account that many documented types of swords are featured in artwork (be it tomb effigys or paintings) which most often heavily feature individuals of high standing.  Lower quality swords were often times broken down to raw materials, or otherwise lost to the historical record, or poorly maintained and rusted into uselessness.  The time periods that I am most familiar with (mostly early modern, I've just now begun reading a lot of books about the late medieval period) are time periods where many lower class individuals possessed swords.  These people obviously outnumbered people of higher status.  Counting the use of swords in the classical era (Rome comes easily to mind) we can once again see the average infantry man fighting with swords.    I don't doubt at all that spears were usually a primary weapon (or early firearms, as is the case in my area of focus), but often times armies equipped their soldiers with secondary weapons.  I just read an account of Agincourt the other day where it was mentioned that the English archers set about the French troops with swords towards the end of the battle.  Obviously we have the gladius for an earlier example.    I guess I don't want to sell that one minor part of my comment too hard.  The point is that swords were often used by relatively low status people as tools."
SWORDS,3du9pm,Bizzy_Dying,3,Mon Jul 20 02:26:20 2015 UTC,"See, this was quite different in the early medieval.  Lower class warriors tended to use the single edged seax.  Steel was significantly scarcer and more expensive than in the early modern, and having a second steel cutting edge was a luxury only upper class warriors seemed to be able to afford.   Your point about the preservation of swords is worth thinking on.  For my period (bet you can guess its early medieval lol).  The problem for the student of early medieval history and archeology is that most swords from the period are grave finds.  We are fortunate that Pagan Germanic peoples frequently buried their dead warriors with appropriate kit.  Higher status graves contain swords at a higher rate than seaxs.  This trend disappears as Europe Christianizes, and burial rites change, much to the detriment of the modern archeologist."
SWORDS,3du9pm,rompenstein,5,Mon Jul 20 03:35:58 2015 UTC,"No one seems to be getting the point. It's not a question of swords being either killing tools or status symbols. They are status symbols because they are killing tools. They are expensive, difficult to produce, single purpose killing tools, and are therefor ominous."
SWORDS,3du9pm,Gorbix_Kryptos,4,Sun Jul 19 19:22:52 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but many killing tools don't carry the significance, status and imagery of the sword. As 60for30 said, axes, daggers and spears are just as deadly weapons, but didn't carry nearly the level of significance of swords.  But as you said, it's not an either or. They are both deadly killing weapons and deeply symbolic."

I believe you misinterpreted the quote, perhaps because it is plucked out of the lecture. A sword is, as you pointed out, an efficient killing tool -- no dispute there. Yet it is much more than that. It's a symbol of power, status in the community, a reflection of ideals of a society, tells a story about the wielder, the maker, the time period, the conflicts of the land... it's far more than a sharpened piece of steel.   I'd encourage you to listen to him speak about the sword. He's a brilliant and passionate guy."
SWORDS,3du9pm,ONymeros,6,Sun Jul 19 18:24:27 2015 UTC,"I think that's true at the most elemental level.  There is no denying, however, the deep cultural resonance the sword has in every society that has produced them. I suspect this is largely due to the fact you've presented. The sword is the apex of personal, single purpose, hand to hand weapon systems.  A spear can be used to hunt, a dagger to cut meat, an axe to chop wood (to greater or lesser effect), but the sword is a symbol of its singular purpose."
SWORDS,3du9pm,TemptThePuffin,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:16:38 2015 UTC,For real the sword is literally the first tool made whose sole purpose was the taking of human life.

SWORDS,3du9pm,Cheomesh,2,Sun Jul 19 18:57:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's the word ""reduce""and only reading the title that is creating the strife. it being a symbol as you describe probably springs forth from its role in the killing of humans so people are reacting to the potential negative connotation of reduce.

SWORDS,3dr13b,grauenwolf,9,Sat Jul 18 16:59:28 2015 UTC,"I just did a quick read through of the relevant parts of European Weapons and Armour: From the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution by Oakeshott and came away with this:   The variety of sword hilts found during this time makes classifying them in a similar manner to how people have done so with viking hilts an almost impossible task.  Clamshell guards were definitely found in Germany during the time period though. The time period listed encompasses the decline of the plate harness, so I find the claims of being used for armored fighting a little skeptical.  Oakeshott actually mentions these kinds of complex hilted single handed short swords as personal defense weapons.  Full harness heavy cavalry did persist even beyond the English Civil Wars though, so who knows.  Haselrig's armor even survived several point blank gunshots in combat. A paragraph is given to the ""German Sabre"" and the image almost perfectly matches the sword you linked.  These start appearing around 1540 and were often mounted with very short and stout blades.  If that is to be interpreted as a stiff blade, then there may be something to the idea of it being used for thrusting at plate.  There is apparently a great example of one of these in the Tower of London's armory.   Edit: I should mention here that I am not saying that the linked sword is a saber, there is simply so much variety to be found in styles of blades and hilts during this period that it doesn't seem that much of a stretch to assume that a German sabre hilt would be mounted with a stiffer arming sword style blade.     This is roughly the time period that what Oakeshott calls the Reitschwert (translated to riding sword) began to differentiate from what is known today as the rapier.  This is why you see a lot of similar hilt features in the two weapons.     That's all I can really offer, every other book I own on swords glosses over this time period."
SWORDS,3dr13b,ThomasFairfax,5,Sat Jul 18 18:21:21 2015 UTC,"In addition to your information, I'd like to add that the blade being somewhat rounded at the tip, coupled with the apparent flatness of the cross section indicates a preference for cutting over thrusting, which usually precludes fighting against armored opponents. Additionally the clamshell hand guard suggests a user who isn't wearing a mail gauntlet, therefore not heavily armored.   1540 is the same era that gave us the basket hilt broadsword, which was used both in war and in self defense and I would say this sword resembles quite closely.   That all said, a quick Google image search from ""clamshell broadsword"" yields these results. The third result is a listing for a sword quite similar to the one from OP. The blade is more pointed, but the hilt looks strikingly similar."

Not really  Mount and Blade has quite realistic sword combat, it's honestly more intricate than For Honor looks. Multiple blocks to counter multiple attack types, shields only cover what their size allows and can be destroyed, arrows have decent physics and can't just be shot in a straight line (unless you're really really close), and weapon reach is factored in, even to the point that different swords have different reaches. I highly recommend people check out M&B: Warband, the much better sequel, and it's expansion Viking Conquest. Both are excellent games that I feel are quite realistic to medieval combat.   Then there's an old PS2 game called Kengo, which focused on Japanese swords martial arts. You start off slow and ineffective, as you train and learn you get faster and better, and learn more techniques. Quite realistic, and very hard to beat enemies if you haven't trained and don't know what you're doing. Sadly this title is now a bit dated, but it was incredibly realistic and I still point to it as a great example of simulated sword combat.   For Honor doesn't look realistic to me, at all. There's some defense/attack mechanics...woopee. There are still stupid spin moves and the costumes/visuals just scream ""action game"" to me, reminds me of the Dynasty Warriors series.

SWORDS,3dodoz,uncommonman,2,Sun Jul 19 13:58:08 2015 UTC,"There is a lot of pretty ugly swordplay in there. It can be a lot more technical than that, and I have seen much better swordplay as well. That being said, these guys are still pretty good. In terms of the group battles, I don't know much about historical battles compared to the one on one fights.   I still hold that the sword play can be a lot more technical, as well as with the other kinds of weapons too."
SWORDS,3dodoz,hawkael20,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:51:08 2015 UTC,"I personaly prefer the non technical play style of Chivalry but i understand what you meen about bad swordmanship.  But I quote Döbringer:   But  real  fencing goes  straight  and  is  simple  in  all  things without  holding  back  or  being  restricted just  as  if  a  string  had  been  tied  or  as  if  they had  been  connected.  When  you  strike  or thrust  at  another  in  front  of  you,  then  no strikes  or  thrusts  before  or  behind,  nor  besides  or  wide  reaching  movements or  many strikes  will  help  if  you  hold  back  and  lose the  chance. Instead you must strike straight and  direct  to  the  man,  to  the  head  or  to  the body  whatever  is  the  closest  and  quickest. This  must  be  done  with  speed  and  rather with  one  strike  than  with  four  or  six  which will  again  leave  you  hanging  and  giving  the opponent  a  chance  to  hit  you.   Or as John Snow says:   Stick them with the pointy end.   And even if Chivalry is less than perfect I get a more realistic feeling from that than from Mount and blade."
SWORDS,3dodoz,uncommonman,3,Sun Jul 19 22:22:59 2015 UTC,"I couldn't agree with you more about For Honor.  The first thing that struck me when watching the preview was that using a mordhau after seeing someone cut through plate armor is ridiculous.  Either armor is being represented correctly in this universe, and you need anti-armor techniques, or armor is able to be cut through (because magic) and you don't need specialized anti-armor techniques."
SWORDS,3dodoz,ThomasFairfax,2,Sat Jul 18 03:36:22 2015 UTC,"I love Mount and Blade, I love it so much, but it's nowhere near the level of realism that Kingdom Come has got. Biggest problems are:  1- A buckler offers a protected area the size of a refrigerator door, even at the base level. Full shield skill + one on your back, you might as well be in an Abrams tank.  2- The usual ""Swords can't melt plate armor"" issue. No matter how heavily armored an enemy is, even the shittiest sword draws blood.  3- AI seemingly coded by Ricky from Trailer Park Boys.  4- Stiff blocking. It's like they're TRYING to break their wrists and damage their weapons. Block a downward power strike from a six foot long greatsword head-on with a thin wooden staff? Sure! Definitely won't get cut from head to dick!  I could go on.  Even For Honor looks more, erm, ""Physically plausible"" than Mount and Blade. But Kingdom Come is just on another level. Can't wait."

I haven't played with bucklers, didn't notice they had such a wide protective area, lame!   The plate armor one I kinda understand, the higher level units that have plate armor take more hits to kill, but the armor doesn't actually block swords and such. I think they had to do that though, otherwise you'd have to hit very small hit boxes for armored enemies, and with so many enemies in each battle it would be impossible.   I'm stoked for Kingdom Come now, having done some more watching and reading. I'll probably still pass on For Honor, unless the multiplayer turns out to be really good."

I would hazard a guess that it was said by a popular youtuber, and spread from there.     Military historian Mike Loades seems to disagree with the assertion.  Not withstanding the obvious fact that people still carried swords when they were expecting to encounter only men in armor.    You can transfer a ton of energy with a sword, maybe not as much as a war hammer but enough to concuss, bruise, and even break bones.  Armor deflects, but a sharp blade can bite into armor and minimize the deflection."

The Sword slid down the wall and landed on the carpet, causing the pommel to pop off and go rolling. Turns out the pommel was cast plastic covered in a thin veneer of cheap potmetal.   Bear in mind, this was some years ago, so it's possible they've upgraded their production methods, but then again it's just as probable that they have remained the same or even gone downhill. Either way, I'd not invest in their products after that.  As for non-sword weapons, well, I can't speak from experience, but if they're willing to cut those kinds of corners on sword production, I wouldn't hold out much hope for their other offerings to be of sound construction.  End of the day, they're a production house, and at the price point, corners have to be cut somewhere. The question is, are they being cut places that are critical to the structural integrity and safety of the piece (like my friend's pommel)? Maybe, maybe not, I'm not lining up to find out."

Maybe you get a great sword for a bargain, or maybe you get a deathtrap.

All of the pieces I have looked at from them have great reviews and are good mid range swords at 200-300 CAD$.   I absolutely recommend any of their newer stock.

As for most of their swords, I just looked them up and the prices are lower than I remember, or maybe I was thinking of another maker, to be completely honest, I haven't been in the production sword market for some years and very well could have confused them with another maker, so I'll concede that point, the prices don't seem extortionately high. I'll edit my post appropriately to reflect this.  Everything else still stands: I don't care for a lot of the styling and the proportions on a lot of their swords are weird. There are a lot of people out that probably won't care, I'm not one of them.   Like I said: if you like something, buy it, but know what you're getting."

However you can go to Kultofathena and find most of their stuff in the 200-500 range.  There are some exceptions but those tend to be outliers.  This is entirely in the mid/budget range where if I buy something I know it's a trade off between....  Looks, Performance, Durability, and Fittings.  In my mind Cold Steel ((for the price)) is Passable in Looks, Below Average in Performance, Above Average in Durability, and Average in Fittings.  So yeah... Middle of the Road price.. Middle of the Road Swords.  I own several, and I've never felt cheated, but I've never felt like I got more than I should have for the money.  I will say that my favorite purchase is still their 1917 Cutlass, mainly because I took it out to some test cuttings where my friends had their ""$500+ Katanas real Katanas that are folded over 1000 times and are way better than any western sword, didn't you see gunny dominate when he did a Katana vs Longsword shoot out... hahah.. get that thing out of here...""  and I did better with it then they did with their blades.

SWORDS,3dkntt,Autumn-Moonlight,6,Fri Jul 17 01:16:01 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion as a martial artist:   I think it's the sort of thing that would require a lot of specialized training to use effectively. Movement is going to be heavily restricted with the wrist locked into place.  Furthermore, it doesn't seem like it would be terribly effective for any sort of cutting. As a stabbing weapon, it's probably terrifying, provided you're no impeded by said lack of mobility.   The problem with historical oddities like this is that they're oddities for a reason. There is a reason that, say swords of approximately 25-30 inches featuring a single edged, curved blade existed for centuries across the globe, and that reason is because it's a damned effective layout for a weapon, combining lethality with mobility and ease of use.  Mind, I'm not deriding you for being interested in an oddity (I own a Dacian Falx, I know what it's like to enjoy weird things). Just, if you're looking for something to be effective in a hypothetical combat scenario, this probably isn't it. You'd be lucky to find someone who knows the requisite martial art to effectively use such a thing on this hemisphere."

SWORDS,3dkntt,hawkael20,2,Fri Jul 17 01:56:19 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Yes, with an 'if'. Long answer: No, with a 'but'.  You will have added power and leverage against a thrust aimed at your body. It looses out on both manoeuvrability and speed, due to the lack of ability to rotate at the wrist. Against poor leverage weapons like a spear/insert-thrusting-weapon-here you'll see an improvement, but comparable length blades will have an advantage against you."

Just because they may sound the same (when transliterated to Western alphabet - in this case without tone marks) doesn't mean they have any linguistic relation.   More importantly they don't even sound the same when said aloud in Mandarin, which is the origin language both phrases (one a normal noun, one a proper noun), as can be seen from the pinyin.

And yet I got yelled at by another linguistic expert for assuming that every historical language and dialect in China begins with Mandarin, so I respectfully disagree with your assessment.   There's a lot that happened in China's history, and a lot that was appropriated--or assigned--to Japan, and it's interesting to see how certain topics and themes play out through the literature over centuries.   To bring it back on topic, there's debate that China may have created the first wudao, and that Japan appropriated it for their own culture in creating their nihonto. There are interested parties on both sides that deny this... but it's interesting to parse the past and speculate where and how influences could have ended up."

SWORDS,3dha3q,Klaimzlgd,7,Thu Jul 16 07:03:02 2015 UTC,"For longsword fighting, I prefer a longer grip. A lot of the motions require what groups call a 'dynamic grip' which involves your lower hand shifting around quite a bit. The extra length makes it easier with heavy gloves and gives you a bit more leverage in your strikes. It also serves as a good lever to hook your opponent's arms when you grapple. and has once or twice even stopped an incoming blow that would have hit my hands!  The counterpoint to that is it is also a larger target. Several times I've had someone simply grab the grip between my hands and pull it away or bind me down. It also will make the sword that much heavier, depending on where the balance is.  Really it depends on the kind of sword, the style of fighting, and personal preference!"
SWORDS,3dha3q,Valerie_Monroe,4,Thu Jul 16 17:38:07 2015 UTC,Long grips allow for greater leverage but get in the way more often.
SWORDS,3dha3q,Vennificus,3,Thu Jul 16 07:09:45 2015 UTC,"Another major benefit to a shorter, single hand, grip that I haven't seen mentioned yet is that it frees up your other hand for doing useful things like: holding a shield, holding a pistol, holding a horses reins, and grappling.    That isn't to say that you can't do those things with most longswords, but as /u/vennificus mentioned, the handle gets in the way more often.  Because they are designed for fighting without a shield, a longsword with a cross-hilt also benefits greatly from metal hand protection and/or guard positions that leave the hands less vulnerable.  Sword use is often dictated by both the defensive and offensive properties of a sword.  The shape of swords (including hilt length) is often for very specific reasons related to that.  If you're looking into learning how to use a sword, I would recommend examining why that is (an interest in movies or history of a certain time period?) and then picking your sword based off of the schools of swordsmanship that existed in that time and place."
SWORDS,3dha3q,ThomasFairfax,2,Thu Jul 16 17:10:39 2015 UTC,"What kind of sword? I would recommend a grip that allows up to about a fist's worth of space between hands for a two-handed grip and and room for the weight of the pommel to be exposed, otherwise you lose the whole reason for a two-handed sword, leverage. Two hands with your fists together is also awkward as you reduce the range of motion when your wrists collide. Anything longer than that and you are flirting with some sort of short pole-arm.  Pommel exposure creates faster cuts than a pommel covered by your hands. You want the pommel to be able to ""swing"". This assumes you are using a sword with a pommel.  On a one-handed sword with a pommel, let the pommel swing. That is how long the grip should be.  The grip doesn't need to be longer than that unless there is a specific reason (balance, etc, rapier fencers can get obsessive over balance)."
SWORDS,3dha3q,hkdharmon,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:35:48 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of it comes down to your build.   I prefer to use a long tsuka (13-14 inches) because I have very broad shoulders, but proportionally short arms and broad hands. The longer grip allows me to more properly relax my shoulders, where shorter grips tend to make me want to ""pinch up"" in the shoulders, which creates unwanted tension, as per my sensei's instructions, I moved to a longer grip and find it much more comfortable, but for someone else, it would probably get in the way."

SWORDS,3d7vi1,Vennificus,4,Tue Jul 14 06:19:00 2015 UTC,Really interested in how much of this is legit and how much is pandering. Paging /u/gabedamien
SWORDS,3d7vi1,gabedamien,21,Tue Jul 14 05:01:51 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: very good effort on blade (though I wish they hadn't done an oil quench), iffy fittings / tsuka, severely disappointing polish. No pandering per se.    Watching now, will take notes as I go:   Jesus Hernandez (steel guy) is a custom Japanese-style bladesmith. The people in this genre vary along a spectrum of traditionalism; Jesus is a skilled artist but relatively far from the traditional aesthetic compared to, say, Rick Barrett or Anthony DiCristofano. His work isn't my cup of tea (very chaotic hada, rough hamon) but he knows what he's doing. I don't know anything about Mark Green or Zeb Deming. Quoting from The Art of The Japanese Sword (Kapp/Yoshihara) is a safe choice. Smelter is operating on the same principles as the historic tatara but of course it doesn't have the same exact form / construction, nor are the base ingredients identical. Like wine grapes, you could almost say that steel has a terroir component to it (this differentiation by location actually factors into kantei, appraisal of antiques). That doesn't make it worse, just a different ""flavor."" Asymmetric hammers are a Japanese style, though most of them don't have fancy dragon carvings on them. ;-) As I've said previously, tamahagane is not 100% just bloom steel. A literal translation is ""jewel steel"" but a more practical translation is the select steel, the best parts of the raw kera from the bloomery. A subtle distinction but it's like the difference between ""crop"" and ""cream of the crop"" — it matters at least somewhat. Breaking the bits, judging them, stacking, clay + paper, straw ash, etc. — this is all very traditional Japanese approach. So far I am perfectly happy with the video, short of actually getting a licensed Japanese smith to participate they are doing a good job. Right about the power hammers. It's a minority of smiths who only use human-powered assistant hammers. It's not very practical for most lone smiths anyway. Judging from the early folds the material they are starting with is a bit rougher than the official tamahagane produced by the Nittoho tatara. But that doesn't say anything about how it compares to the diverse historical steels that existed. On the subject of spirituality and nihontō — this is absolutely a strong aspect of the traditional art. Of course different smiths approach and/or adhere to that aspect in different ways and to different degrees, but the narrator is not making this stuff up. Using kobuse construction is pretty standard. Minor romanization issues, e.g. ""sonobe"" instead of ""sunobe"". Not a big deal. Usually when they cut the kissaki, they do it backward and then hammer the point back up towards the spine. This makes the hada flow in a curve with the point. As they've done it, the hada will ""run off"" the edge. A small issue but one of those little aesthetic things I wish they had done. He's using an actual sen (draw plane) for the shaping, that's good. He left the edge bare. Most Japanese smiths use different thickness/composition clays for the edge and spine. Actually a thin clay at the edge can actually improve heat transfer, kind of like CPU thermal compound, and also even it out a bit — pure water is a terribly harsh quenchant. However it is interesting to note that there is a theory that early Bizen blades were quenched without any clay coating. What he's doing isn't necessarily invalid although it is different from common practice. Oil quench… this is the single biggest difference they've done so far, and partly explains the bare edge. :-/ Will result in a rather different kind of hamon and reduce the likelihood of many kinds of hataraki. Will actually likely result in a stronger blade with fewer stressed bits but a significantly different aesthetic. Moving onto koshirae/tōsogu. Obviously they're replicating the movie sword which has some traditional and some iffy bits in it. The sanko (trident vajra) is an historical motif though not commonly seen in menuki. Traditional Japanese woodwork is all about chisels (as they show here). Very sharp chisels. No sandpaper when you make saya / tsuka, grit could get stuck and ruin a blade. Glad they're using shakudō. Probably the most classic of all Japanese alloys. There are a lot of subtle but important craft details that go into proper a proper tsuka & tsukamaki. They do some things right here but it's also clear that they haven't studied under a traditional craftsman. When using paneled samé it's common to carve a shallow channel in the tsuka core to avoid the ""seam"" showing through under the wrap. What really hurts is that they did all the ""twists"" in the hineri-maki going the same direction… that's a classic Chinese fake move. Not only does it not look as good as the alternating method, but it's not as secure either. :-/ They're approaching the right look and putting in the effort but the details are not all there. Final shot… the tsuka core is not quite shaped right. The ideal is the haichimonji form, where the edge side is straight and the spine side is curved. The ito is a bit too wide meaning the ""diamonds"" are a bit too big / few. The fuchi is cylindrical — real fuchi actually have one edge sloped, asymmetrically, to make for a better flow between tsuka and fuchi. Here you can see the flow is kind of disrupted. Also in a closeup you can see that the ito sticks out more than the fuchi — again, in a traditional core the wood is carved down to account for this difference. Polish does not do this sword justice at all. With all the labor and skill they poured into crafting the blade, it is a downright shame that the polish doesn't come anywhere near where it should. There is probably some very interesting workmanship masked by an unfinished surface, and the geometry is soft & uneven. This my #1 disappointment with the video. I should have predicted it… a high-end polish is a very high expense and would have doubled the time this project required. It might not have been feasible for their shooting schedule. Saya and habaki look decent. Horimono of the foo dog is… well, it's not a masterpiece by a traditional artist. On the other hand I've seen laughable Chinese fakes that are certainly worse. Carving 3D in hardened sword steel is difficult and very time-intensive, I'll just skip over this bit.   Well, there you have it."

Not only does it not look as good as the alternating method, but it's not as secure either.   I've been wondering about this since i added some hemp cord to my viking reenactment axe and decided to do it ""ito style"" because why the hell not.  Is it really unsafe? You can have one strand cross over in the ""front"" and under in the ""back"", so it's not like it will always be the same on top. The traditional way as far as i could figure has the same strand crossing over front and back, then under front and back, repeat.  That of course says nothing about aesthetics or tradition."

Yeah, he's one of the few doing a clay-less quench. Usually when people do it they're going for a juka-chōji hamon in the style of old Ichimonji blades.   Is it really unsafe?

Even with alternating which strand is on top however, twists going the same way will move around slightly more easily than alternating twists. That's much less of a concern than always having the same strand on top of course."

SWORDS,3cxoti,TheHobbitHouse,6,Sat Jul 11 18:33:52 2015 UTC,"It looks like a French Briquette. They were used Napoleon's army, and they were not well liked. They were cheaply made, unbalanced, and usually blunt. They didn't see much combat use, but soldiers found two better uses for them. One was to split firewood and kindling, which is how it got the name briquette, which is french for kindling or a lighter. Second, they were famously used for opening champagne bottles that soldiers ""liberated."" This is still a technique that's done today in fancy restaurants and hoity-toity parties, called ""sabering"" a champagne bottle. The blunt edge is slid along the length of a bottle, and the blade sharply strikes the lip at the neck of the bottle. The force of the impact combined with the force of the pressure inside the bottle causes the glass to fracture in a clean ring around the neck of the bottle, and the cork and glass ring go flying off in a shower of champagne. It's messy, but it's an impressive display.  Despite the fact that these were terrible and wildly unsuccessful swords in their day, their association with sabering bottle shad made them popular and there are a lot of reproductions on the market."

In between the wallhanger/sword-like-object class, and the real work of blacksmithing art class, there is a whole class of production swords, usually in the $300-$1000 price range (although there are significant numbers outside of this range, in both direction).   These are factory-produced swords, made in large quantities with varying levels of mechanization involved in the process, in places like China or India. Companies like Hanwei and Windlass spring to mind.  Quality is all over the map too, with some really wonderful blades coming in at this range, and a lot of really awful ones too. It pays to do your research when buying production swords.  Are they real? I suppose that depends on how you qualify real. If you want something that was made by a sweaty dude in a leather apron over an anvil, then no. That kind of thing is going to cost you. But, for the most part, they're properly tempered, and have decent edge geometry and everything else that makes a sword work. That said, production swords do tend to have some problems you don't find in custom or bespoke work. Usually with regards to fit and finish."

If you're looking at going that route, there are plenty of reviews around.  Often, the biggest problem with these is in the construction. Usually the blades are tempered well with good geometry, but properly fitting a hilt requires a lot of close tolerances and precision filework, which means having to take a lot of time, and naturally, drives production costs up. To save time, most production swords cut corners in this area, using one-size-fits-all fittings or welded-on tangs, which can lead to fatal weaknesses.  Of course, there also plenty of skilled bladesmiths willing to make you exactly what you want, and at an assured standard of quality. That being said, be ready to spend well over $1000 minimum if you go this route (though occasionally some smiths will offer lower prices than this, especially if they're just establishing themselves in the industry.) And of course, if you go this route, you should also be willing to wait a few months, or sometimes years, to get your sword. Handmade quality takes time, and often these smiths have long waiting lists."

I have seen some falchions (like this one, some even thinner) that might fit the bill as far as the blade goes, but their hilts are a little more complex.  There are some Italian sideswords with hilts that are slightly less complex than this, and blades that are narrower, but they usually do have some added hand protection.    You might want to even consider some of the less-curvy shamshirs out there.  Picture just for reference, I would not recommend a Cold Steel sword without doing a bit of research on it.

SWORDS,3cuuvl,sylkworm,2,Sat Jul 11 15:13:51 2015 UTC,Lloyd and Skallagim have both been picking up HEMA and are notably more tempered in their opinions
SWORDS,3cuuvl,Vennificus,2,Sat Jul 11 17:24:45 2015 UTC,"This is one of the reasons I prefer Lloyd, though I do watch Matt as well.  But what bugs me about Matt is that he sometimes seems too eager and also that he sometimes makes videos that say nothing or misses the point.   An example being his video on throwing knives were he concludes that knives were actually sometimes thrown. As though anyone was actually saying that knives have never been thrown. The debate at the time being whether or not throwing knives were viable as a ""weapon"". In comparison Lloyds video is vastly superior and effective in conveying his thoughts on the problems with throwing knives.  I think Matt would benefit greatly from some planning and better structure in his videos."
SWORDS,3cuuvl,Gulanga,2,Sun Jul 12 15:28:16 2015 UTC,"It's funny that I get almost the exact opposite read on those two throwing knives videos as you.  In both of his videos on the subject Lloyd offers up a few key points:    Throwing knives were never issued to any armies. Throwing knives are poor for hunting. Knives are better as a melee weapon. Some knives are pretty and expensive, and he would not personally want to throw one of his nice knives.  This is a minor point, but it's important to understand the difference between Lloyd and Matt.    And draws the conclusion that the throwing of knives was not prevalent, because he often uses strong words for his opinions he may even go as far as to suggest that throwing knives was never done.  Matt answers the first point by explaining that knives were carried by basically everyone anyway.  He also mentions very specific scenarios where a throwing knife would be useful and steers the conversation away from talk of armies into more of a one on one scenario.  Matt answers the second point about hunting (and also once again the first point about equipping armies) by explaining that a throwing knife is a weapon of convenience, and clearly not your first choice of missile weapon.  When going hunting, and often when going to war, equipment is selected for the specific task at hand.  This is not the strong suite of a knife, and Lloyd's mention of it is practically irrelevant to the discussion.  I don't think anyone has ever suggested that a throwing knives are a superior ranged weapon, merely plentiful and useful in certain circumstances.  Matt answers the third point by suggesting two very plausible scenarios.  One in which the knife thrower is attempting to escape, and merely means to give his opponent pause.  In this scenario the thrower has essentially conceded defeat and has no intention of engaging his foe in a melee.  Secondly a scenario is described where the thrower is also equipped with a sword, or another better melee weapon, but is engaging a superior fencer.  In this scenario the knife is thrown to disrupt his opponent.  Makes perfect sense.  To the final point, wherein Lloyd mentions that knives are expensive and stones are cheaper to throw as a disruptive weapon, Matt does not answer in his video on the subject.  He does answer it in many of his other videos though, such as his series on edge parrying.  When a life is on the line, like in basically any scenario wherein we're discussing melee combat, most people are not going to immediately think about the aesthetic value of their weapons and attempt to preserve that over their own life.  Honestly, the suggestion that a knife is too expensive to throw in a life or death scenario is so absurd that I can't believe Lloyd brought it up.  This comparison of videos is exactly why I prefer Matt's.  He answers Lloyd (and others), not on a point by point basis, but by offering up his own theory that is plausible (and often based on either solid primary source research or extensive fencing experience).  In this way he dispels some of Lloyd's sillier assertions without being confrontational, or taking away from what Lloyd got right.  For Lloyd's part, I feel that he often uses good points to prove bad theories.  He begins his knife throwing videos by talking about Hollywood overusing throwing knives (like in James Bond movies) and seeks to disprove this notion.  He then talks about armies, and hunting, which aren't at all what Hollywood is depicting (edit: usually anyway.  I'm sure it has happened once or twice.  It's not a common thing though).  He makes weird leaps of scale like this pretty often, to the point where I often have a hard time following his arguments."
SWORDS,3cuuvl,ThomasFairfax,0,Sun Jul 12 16:26:38 2015 UTC,"To quote my previous post:   The debate at the time being whether or not throwing knives were viable as a ""weapon""   I'll illustrate my view by using a few lines from your post.  ""a throwing knife is a weapon of convenience, and clearly not your first choice of missile weapon"".   ""He also mentions very specific scenarios where a throwing knife would be useful""  ""by suggesting two very plausible scenarios. One in which the knife thrower is attempting to escape, and merely means to give his opponent pause""  ""Secondly a scenario is described where the thrower is also equipped with a sword, or another better melee weapon, but is engaging a superior fencer""  My point is that what Matt says here does not have any bearing on the subject of ""throwing knives"". All he is saying is that sometimes knives could be thrown.  The scenarios he uses illustrates this perfectly. To throw something at someone while running away or attacking is of course a valid strategy but what you throw matters little at that point. That it is a knife or a rock does not really make much of a difference there.   That is what Lloyd was saying. In a scenario were a throwing knife could be useful it would not be because it is a throwing knife.   The difference is that Lloyd is actually talking about ""throwing knives"" and not any thrown object. Where as Matt might as well be talking about throwing a helm or a coin purse or whatever else you might be carrying on your person that had some mass. He totally misses the subject."
SWORDS,3cuuvl,Gulanga,2,Sun Jul 12 17:20:46 2015 UTC,"Edit: Sorry, haven't had my coffee yet and misread your post due to the quotations around ""throwing knives"".  I believe the answer to this is that knives would often be in someone's hand while confronting an opponent, whereas rocks and helms wouldn't.  No one walks around with a rock (and there isn't always a rock handy), everyone walks around with a knife during these periods.  Coin purses might work though."

Not as bad as someone like Thrand (omg vikings sploosh) but it was enough.  Skallagrims videos have been going up in quality and apparently he's working with HEMA now which is a really good step.

SWORDS,3ctq6p,Devcoil,4,Sat Jul 11 16:30:40 2015 UTC,"The most important bit is the blade.   It looks more like a mass produced wallhanger piece, like others have said.   I'd inspect the handle, there should be little bamboo pegs in two (maybe one) spot. If the little pegs look clean and well together(should be light tan), and the handle doesn't rattle then it's probably okay to swing around.   But still be careful and mindful of what's around you. The pegs could still be bad. Smacking something will wear on them, and without the pegs you've got nothing holding onto the blade."

SWORDS,3cq0iu,Ray-Prophezine,3,Fri Jul 10 13:21:59 2015 UTC,"It looks like it might be a dress sword for the queen's royal horse guard done in the old Victorian style.

SWORDS,3cq0iu,ozonesmog,3,Thu Jul 9 22:43:52 2015 UTC,"Whilst I can not offer an alternative (at the moment), I don't think this is a queen Elizabeth II sword. Firstly the monogram for the queen is all wrong, there is not even a mention of an E II R any where. The ""eagle"" used for the hilt is not related to the British monarchy or military in any (close) way, it looks closer to Germanic or Scandinavian crests e.g. this german royal crest is far closer than the British lion and unicorn http://cache1.asset-cache.net/gc/102115699-illustration-of-german-eagle-crest-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&c=IWSAsset&k=2&d=RuHC0aLgYOsk0al1%2FS5osMfA2mlcw8jHPk4fW6vlo4I%3D.   As well as this the sword is in a french-ish Napoleonic style e.g. http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oOC0l-qhglM/Ty5N7E8a7mI/AAAAAAAACz0/qKQrOxoR9gc/s1600/premier.jpg which the brits did not really use post 1900 (as well as the fact that more modern (post 1900) British swords do not use brass guards but steel)  This is not an attack on Ray-prophezine, just a contribution; I don't think it is British or form E II R period. This is either a really good replica / oddball or is to obscure for me to piece together."

Some more pictures (not the best quality though):  Side by side  Blades  The tips seem to be blunt(ed)  Sword 1:  http://i.imgur.com/K6FcSE9.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/aSSs6Av.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/o6N7lPn.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/Dj4Viid.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/FLXEiFC.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/9BePZob.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/q2tNyOT.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/h3T7pFL.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/z590nFW.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/DoHmMRY.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/4ooTsQc.jpg  Sword 2:  http://i.imgur.com/cDnriWV.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/N7Kk61v.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/dnLnH9q.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/k2xis9C.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/RJ6WW6U.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/wz51F6C.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/5xZJpWY.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/hBjOrbB.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/h1pYYHu.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/E4PlsBt.jpg  It seems to me that the mother of pearl (at least I think thats what it is?) on sword 2 got broken at some point and repaired with a piece that doesnt quite match the pattern of the remaining two pieces. Possibly?  Is it possible that, since they seem to be a pair, they were meant to be dueling swords? Or were they simply purely ornamental, meant to hang on someone's wall? Or, are they modern-ish remakes made to look old, with no value at all (which would be a slight bummer for me, since Ive gone and bought them now :p not that I paid very much for them I think). Neither of them had a... what you call those in English... sheath?"
SWORDS,3cnst1,Azekh,2,Thu Jul 9 22:01:37 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert on smallswords, so take it with a grain of salt.   They seem to have a weld at the base of the blade, that's rather weird, but the blade looks proper other than that. The ""shell"" guard opens towards the point, that's rather strange from a functional PoV, so it's likely they were mostly for dress or decoration to begin with. They're very similar so it's indeed possible that they're a set, though the blunted point is odd for a set. Perhaps it's a rather fancy pair of training swords, perhaps they were meant to be unable to actually stab someone in court. Still the blunt point would seem to move things towards them being used for something, not hanging on a wall where the only thing the blunt point would accomplish is make them look worse.   In short, i'd guess they are actual swords, but meant for court with a blunt tip to avoid ""accidents"" or meant for training and on the fancy side."
SWORDS,3cnst1,OrdoCorvus,3,Thu Jul 9 23:29:45 2015 UTC,"Actually, given all of this, I think stage or film use might be a real possibility. The cast grips and (mother of pearl? Paint? Plastic?) inlay on the hilts looks a little rough for court swords, but at any distance probably looks great.  The blunt points and welds at the base of the blades also point in that direction, being something a prop department might do, rather than a bladesmith.  Additionally, they look old, but not really that old."
SWORDS,3cnst1,Azekh,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:37:46 2015 UTC,"I really don't know. I guess it's possible, but i'd say most productions wouldn't even go this far with the hilts.  The weld is strange but some modern blades do it (on the inside) so the hilt takes more abuse before rattling. Of course if that's all that's holding the blades in place we'd have something that really shouldn't be used there."
SWORDS,3cnst1,OrdoCorvus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:02:40 2015 UTC,"Unless the hilts were sourced from somewhere else. American fencing supply has offerings like this for stage and film use. Mind you, those are new. Or perhaps they were cast off existing swords? Something about the casting of the hilt components seems off to me, like they were copied. They're just a little too rough around the edges. Sometimes, theatrical swords got quite complex, for example: http://users.wpi.edu/~virtualarmory/CollectionIQP/artifact.pl?anum=125.a  In any case, without any written provenience, we can only guess.

SWORDS,3cm1j4,Vennificus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:39:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's not a real sword. Way too heavy.  The two-handed swords used in HEMA fighting (which are basically real swords, except blunted as to not kill anyone) weight ca 3.3 pounds. A 9 pound behemoth would be way too heavy to swing around like that."
SWORDS,3cm1j4,Bumchairleg,8,Thu Jul 9 20:46:17 2015 UTC,"Heavy is bad stainless is bad, it has a certain type of polish that's easy to spot as well, not sure what that's about no center ridge or fuller, extra bad Cheap paint bad sign,"
SWORDS,3cm1j4,Azekh,4,Thu Jul 9 00:10:23 2015 UTC,"The glossy looking polish on most stainless wallhanger blades is from a cloth buffing wheel with a ton of compound on it. It'll also sort of 'melt' all the edges and grind lines on the blade, which is mostly the reason it isn't fashionable on higher quality blades. Sharp straight grinds take a lot of skill, and buffing would wash them out."
SWORDS,3cm1j4,OrdoCorvus,4,Thu Jul 9 00:30:51 2015 UTC,"no center ridge or fuller, extra bad   To be fair ""lenticular"" or ""hexagonal"" cross sections are a thing. The issue here is that the blade has absolutely no shaping for most of the length, same width, same thickness, hence ridiculous weight (and i don't even want to guess where the point of balance is).  Also the grip looks as thick as that bicycle tire, which is quite excessive."
SWORDS,3cm1j4,Gakuseinozen,2,Thu Jul 9 02:40:37 2015 UTC,"Not to mention those short, crazy-steep bevels."
SWORDS,3cm1j4,ElCapitanoRoberto,3,Thu Jul 9 07:30:26 2015 UTC,"I assume by 'real' you mean 'usable'.     There are many things about this piece that tell me no, it is not usable.    The ornate/gaudy hilt.  Most swords meant to be used as weapons have simple/plain fittings - normally mild steel or bronze for the crossguard and pommel with a leather-over-wire wrapped grip.  The hilt is a dead giveaway that this is some kind of fantasy inspired decorative piece.  The finish/material of the blade.   The mirror finish of the blade tells me it's probably stainless steel.  Stainless steel is NOT appropriate for a blade longer than a knife.  It will not take the shock of repeated impacts (or maybe not even one) without snapping as it is far too hard/brittle.  Real swords are made from high carbon steel which give them flexibility and resilience to take the impact of a hit.  The shape of the blade.  The blade is basically just a thick bar of metal which appears to have been simply stamped or cut out of a solid sheet and has not been altered to give it better handling characteristics.  A quality sword is usually hand forged or made by a process called stock removal and possesses a few key characteristics.  Among those are profile taper (the blade gets narrower as it gets to the point) and distal taper (the blade gets thinner as it gets to the point), of which this blade appears to have neither.  Tapering the blade reduces weight and makes it perform better in the cut.  The edge of the blade.  The edges on here are huge and immediately visible from far away.  Typically the edge on a real sword is quite imperceptible unless you are close up.  On this blade you can clearly see a secondary bevel (a sudden and abrupt transition from the flat of the blade to the edge). While secondary bevels are sometimes present on real swords, they do not start so far out on the blade.  More often, it's preferable to have what's known as an appleseed edge, or an edge that transitions smoothly and imperceptibly from the blade to the edge.  The weight.  A single handed sword will weigh anything from 1.5 to around 3 pounds depending on the construction and intended use.   9 pounds is far too heavy for something this size to be used effectively for anything other than perhaps bludgeoning someone over the head.    Another feature that I can't see, but I assume is present is the lack of a substantial tang.  The tang is the part of the blade that goes through the handle.  On a real sword, the tang is a part of the blade (all one piece, not welded or otherwise fastened on), travels all the way through the handle and is fastened to the pommel - preferably peened although some are secured via a hex nut (which is still secure) or screwed on (which is not as secure or safe)."

SWORDS,3cm1j4,PoisonousPlatypus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:52:54 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone. Very small collector here. I only own a few replica items that I've picked up over the years. I've been given this old sword by a friend that had no desire for it. The blade itself is extremely heavy. Heavier than any of my replica swords I have ever owned, which is why I believe it may be real. Is there any way to tell just by looking at it? Thanks!"
SWORDS,3cm1j4,OrdoCorvus,11,Wed Jul 8 23:28:44 2015 UTC,"Heavy swords are bad swords.  You can usually tell if a sword is a wall hanger or tourist piece by looking for crudeness and impracticality. That blade is far too thick, likely has no distal taper and those cutouts at the base serve no purpose other than to look cool. It's almost certainly stainless steel, which will probably break if you hit something even remotely solid.  Same with the hilt, which looks too fantasy. It looks all one piece, moulded plastic or cast metal that has been painted, and that ""gem"" is glass or plastic. Look at the bottom of the pommel. My guess is there is no tang that has been peened to the pommel, and that the blade is just glued into the hilt or something like that.  Real swords are easy to spot once you get an idea of what they should look like. Look for some real historical swords and compare them with fantasy or movie swords. The differences should be very clear."

This light surface rust should be gone in maybe 2-4 days  These other methods are a little aggressive for the kind of rust you have, if you're not happy with the finish after the rust is gone and you have used the steel wool, only then try some very fine wet-n-dry sandpaper, but try a very fine grit first and see how it's coming up, you can always go to a coarser grit if it's not enough."

As a summary however:   sankozukaken (trident vajra hilted sword) sankoken (trident vajra sword) kongōken (vajra sword) hōken (treasure sword) chiken (sword of wisdom) ken (straight double-edged sword)   The vajra is an esoteric Buddhist symbol combining diamond-indestructability and thunderbolt-unstoppability, a spiritual weapon of clarity and steadfastness against wayward emotions. When in the trident sanko form, the vajra symbolizes the sanbō (three jewels/treasures) of Buddism: Buddha, law, and community. When the sanko is used as the hilt for a ken, it refers to the chiken (sword of wisdom) carried by Fudō Myōō (the immovable king of light, one of the five Wisdom Kings and a major figure of esoteric Buddhism). Fudō channels wrath into compassion, pledging to aid all sentient beings in the pursuit of truth and dispelling of worldly desires. He uses the chiken to cut away the illusions of this world.  TL;DR — ritual sword symbol of spiritual steadfastness / the wrathful rejection of worldly desires and illusions."

SWORDS,3cecnb,Flounderp12,0,Tue Jul 7 06:37:17 2015 UTC,Are you planning on taking lessons? I was very interested in kendo for a while but I got discouraged by a few facts. First if you take lessons you probably won't touch a shinai for quite some time. Most places have you focus on footwork for a few months before you get to spar. Also kendo is not like fencing where you are able to slip your blade in anywhere and score touches. Kendo strikes have to be called and land where you intend for them to land. If you are looking for a very strict and structured sword art with a heavy zen influence then kendo is cool. If you are looking to spar and get a lot of actual combat in I would strongly recommend trying fencing instead.
SWORDS,3cecnb,migarthdude,4,Wed Jul 8 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"Or HEMA, or some FMA, or at the very least Kenjutsu. Depending on the type, I wouldn't really call sport fencing combat. With the lack of the afterblow, the severely underweighted simulators, and with the exception of Epee, the limited target zones and overly artificial rules, it falls short of a martial art.  There is Classical fencing which is much closer, as well as straight up old rapier work in HEMA"
SWORDS,3cecnb,Vennificus,3,Wed Jul 8 17:31:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, such a lot of misconceptions.  Firstly, most kendo dojos will have you holding a shinai within the first couple of classes.  We do it first class, others maybe run a class or two of pure footwork first.  I don't know of any dojos that make you wait months.  Second, you don't call your strike in kendo.  You kiai the name of the point at the exact same time you hit.  Once you have practised for a while, that yell becomes instinctive.  You will have to wait some time before sparring.  Typically it is anywhere from 3 to 6 months of basics before you start to wear the armour and spar.  You will be hitting other people a good while before you wear armour.  So the progression is footwork->swinging in the air->hitting a held target (another shinai)->hitting someone in armour->fighting in armour.  As far as the OPs request about shinai: it's best you wait until you join a club. They can point you to a good supplier, and often they will have shinai in stock to sell you.    If you need to buy one yourself, I recommend e-bogu.com.  Just get a basic practice shinai like these ones.   If you are an adult male you will need size 39.  If you are female, either a 38 or a ladies 39 (they are a bit lighter).  If you are younger, best consult your sensei for the best size for you, based on your age and strength."

SWORDS,3caxws,guassmith,53,Mon Jul 6 14:14:13 2015 UTC,"Swords can break, if the forces are right. It's not supposed to happen but it did sometimes.  Japanese swords vary. Most are a bit harder than the average European sword, and while hardness helps with sharpness it also makes a blade more brittle. Suishinshi Masahide strongly influenced Japan in the late 1700s when he published reports of many blades in the Osaka Shintō style* breaking. As a result many smiths sought a return to a more classic style of hamon, narrower with less nie, which was thought to be stronger.  Extant European swords vary tremendously in hardness (carbon content) and heat treatment. In general many of them were tempered (a post-quench process that relieves stress, resulting in a springier albeit slightly softer blade).  Both European and Japanese swords have broken in the past. I have no doubt that in use, some Japanese swords could break some European swords and vice-versa. Neither is a likely outcome, more often in the worst case a blade will chip or bend, but it is always in the realm of possibility. You are right that it isn't easy.  It doesn't really make sense to talk about a specific form or origin of sword breaking another. That's like saying European cars can outrace Japanese cars. The generality is somewhat ridiculous in the face of the massive variation in both cultures.     with wide, billowing hamon filled with nie — coarse martensitic crystals from high-temp quenching, very hard"

SWORDS,3caxws,pipocaQuemada,9,Mon Jul 6 17:40:04 2015 UTC,"Both European and Japanese swords have broken in the past. I have no doubt that in use, some Japanese swords could break some European swords and vice-versa. Neither is a likely outcome, more often in the worst case a blade will chip or bend, but it is always in the realm of possibility. You are right that it isn't easy.   Basically, you're (essentially) never going to break a sword on purpose.  Even trying to cut a wooden spear or smallsword is immensely difficult - there's a bunch of videos on youtube of people failing.  If a sword breaks, it's essentially a freak accident due to poor steel or mishandling of the blade - it's just as likely for the katana to break the zweihander as the zweihander to break the katana."

SWORDS,3caxws,gabedamien,0,Mon Jul 6 15:20:36 2015 UTC,I thought that samurai would carry two swords because the katana would break somewhat often?
SWORDS,3caxws,NoNations,5,Mon Jul 6 23:12:41 2015 UTC,"Er, definitely not. Carrying two swords was a cultural code that evolved over time.  From about the mid-Heian period (~1100) to the early/mid Muromachi (~1400) the cultural elite wore a slung tachi (long sword, about 75–80 cm edge length, tapered) as their primary sidearm, often with either a tantō (dagger) or kodachi/koshigatana (short sword / hip sword) as an ancillary grappling / backup weapon. It bears noting that an especially high-ranking person would keep his tantō on his person and have a vassal carry the tachi as a symbol of his authority; so the secondary weapon also became a primary weapon in some circumstances. Meanwhile, lower-ranking soldiers on foot would wear a single uchigatana (strike sword) worn edge-up, somewhat shorter than tachi.  From about mid-Muromachi to the early Edo period, there was less mounted cavalry and more fighting on foot; the tachi fell out of favor and the uchigatana replaced it and started to be called simply ""katana"" (sword). Higher-ranking warriors were still used to carrying two blades on their person however, so a katana + short blade (either tantō or wakizashi) became more common.  During the early Edo period, the country was at peace; carrying weapons became largely a badge of office / personal sidearm. Laws enacted in 1645 and 1668 codified this dress code into an official one: only titled samurai were allowed to carry blades over 1 shaku 5 sun (45.5 cm edge), and jōsun (standard length) for katana was stipulated as 2 shaku 3 sun (69.7 cm). Now, commoners were legally allowed to carry blades up to 1 shaku 5 sun, and they frequently went right up to the limit. Samurai however were allowed to wear even longer wakizashi, up to 1 shaku 9 sun (57.6 cm).  When going inside, it was customary to remove one's long sword but still carry one's short sword. So ask yourself, if you are an average samurai… are you going to carry a wakizashi shorter than the ones all the commoners are wearing, or take advantage of your status and wear something a bit longer? This may explain why so many samurai wore katana + wakizashi as their official daishō. It bears noting that if all you carry indoors is a wakizashi, that's probably a better weapon than a tantō. But during the Edo period it was largely for show anyway.  I remember reading that there was one notable samurai who wore only his wakizashi while walking to his favorite brothel in the evening. He ended up being reported in the papers as inspiring a ""hip new fashion of the night"" or something, hahaha!  On a related note, tantō production during the Edo period practically fell off the map. Tantō from the Muromachi and earlier periods are much more common. Tantō worn by samurai during the Edo period were usually an aristocratic choice, and Edo tantō koshirae are often highly decorative as a result.  For whatever reason, the daishō of katana + wakizashi became more or less the official dress code of the samurai. It was more cultural than anything practical. Though there technically was no law saying only samurai could wear a pair of swords, since there was a law saying only samurai could wear katana in effect the daishō itself was permitted only to samurai. It makes a powerful statement.  The idea that it was because the long sword would frequently break is just not based in any kind of historical record however. Never heard that one before, not in many years of study."
SWORDS,3caxws,Vel_Getica,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:37:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response. I knew there were laws limiting sword lengths of samurai and commoners, but I didn't know they had to remove the longer sword when going indoors. I thought the primary purpose of the backup blade was to replace the primary if it broke."
SWORDS,3caxws,EbenSquid,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:14:45 2015 UTC,The wakizashi katana combo is a status symbol. The shorter(wakizashi) was for tight quarters. The katana outside of duels was a sidearm. Yari and bows were preferred primaries.  Ninja edit: only samurai were allowed to carry a daisho(katana wakizashi combo) other classes were only allowed one sword if any for protection.
SWORDS,3caxws,EbenSquid,12,Tue Jul 7 02:59:33 2015 UTC,"If you were to place the classic 17th century katana in a pair of vices and hit it with a powerful and lucky blow from your 17th century Zweihander, it is possible you could break it.  The reverse is also true, of course. The Zweihander would break just as easily to the Katana if held immobile by mechanical means.  Held in human hands however, it is more likely to be knocked away before enough force could be applied to break the blade, resulting in either a parry or a disarm.   In actual practice, 90%+ of actual blade breakage occurred due to flaws in the blade itself, and happened the first time the blade saw combat.  This is why an heirloom blades first became valuable, as the only way to know, beyond a shadow of a doubt that a blade was good was to have tested it in battle."
SWORDS,3caxws,EbenSquid,2,Mon Jul 6 15:46:40 2015 UTC,"""Weaker"" is a word with little meaning unless qualified in this instance.   While a Zweihander would be normally considered to be made of ""higher quality"" steel than your average 17th century katana, the variable temper of the Japanese swordmakers made extremely resilient blades considering the raw material.   A high carbon steel Zweihander without proper temper on the other hand, while ""strong"" if somone were to say, pull a truck with it, would nevertheless shatter like glass against a shield or another blade."
SWORDS,3caxws,Azekh,2,Tue Jul 7 01:30:44 2015 UTC,"the hamon of a japanese blade marks the transition between hard and soft steel. This is the beauty of the Japanese tempering technique. The edge is indeed harder and more brittle (and sharper) than your average European equivalent, however the spine of the blade is much MUCH softer, and thus able to flex and absorb significant shock.   Were the entire blade made of one temper or the other it would indeed be a very inferior weapon. The combination is what made the Japanese blades something truly special.   It also is why modern Chinese and Pakistani replicas fare so poorly.  Personally, I prefer European smallsword & dagger for practice, but if it could be made with Japanese Variable Temper I would be in love, not that I think that is even possible."
SWORDS,3caxws,SquiffSquiff,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:03:24 2015 UTC,"The thing is the European style hardens the whole blade then tempers it, which makes it elastic. Hardening the spine less in nihonto doesn't have quite the same effect IIRC, it's indeed softer but not very elastic."
SWORDS,3caxws,Azekh,8,Tue Jul 7 10:48:30 2015 UTC,"'Break' in what sense? Just about every sword style has parrying moves, they can take it. You might manage to disarm an opponent but I would not expect one sword to break another in pieces"
SWORDS,3caxws,SquiffSquiff,2,Tue Jul 7 13:25:06 2015 UTC,"It happens... if you use a sword long enough. Though depending on the steel/heat treat it may have been bent to uselessness before that can happen.  Still we've had one rapier break right in the middle when delivering a cut and being stopped by a dagger, some ""musketeer""/double epee breaking at the tang because they're not made to deliver cuts, and an arming sword breaking on first use probably because of a heat treat defect."
SWORDS,3caxws,Azekh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:54:08 2015 UTC,Aren't épées and rapiers fairly long and skinny though? And rapiers quite stiff? Not saying it couldn't happen but a traditionally made katana is relatively short and pretty chunky
SWORDS,3caxws,Ozy-dead,2,Mon Jul 6 14:35:19 2015 UTC,"They're somewhat more flexible since we need to thrust at each other with them, and skinny is relative. They're thick but narrow compared to other european swords. Those epee blades just weren't made for this and had a square and not very thick tang, which is fine when thrusting but can't take the stress when cutting (mine broke when delivering a cut to the mask, it wasn't even a huge impact).  Still generally swords bend and take a wrong shape much sooner than they risk breaking unless there's some aggravating factor. Maybe the rapier that broke in the middle had a big dent already for example."

SWORDS,3caxws,iroll20s,3,Mon Jul 6 17:38:15 2015 UTC,"A katana (or any sword with a flaw or weak point in the steel) will snap at its weakest point of hit herd enough on a surface- but usually not when receiving a blow. in a parry or block, the sword that is guarding has the advantage of the holder's hands and arms that absorb extra shock from the incoming impact. the sword that is striking will take more stress, because it's moving much faster and the sudden stop isn't cushioned by the wielder's arms but by the blade's flex and construction. a good Katana won't break outright, but a very large two handed sword has a much better reach (almost like a polearm) and would be very difficult to approach for someone with a katana.   TLDR- a katana might be damaged if it strikes the zwiehander very hard, but not while receiving a hit. The reach advantage of the zwiehander would outweigh any chance of sword breaking, when determining the odds of who might 'win'."
SWORDS,3caxws,stupid_flanders,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:20:20 2015 UTC,The most likely thing to happen would the katana bending if it was used poorly. Kantanas are relatively easy to bend due to the soft metal used in the spine of the sword.   As for breaking or 'cutting' through another sword. Not really likely. Plate armor is quite a bit thinner than swords and its extremely difficult to cut through.
SWORDS,3caxws,iroll20s,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:31:56 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends on the construction method used. Kobuse (hard edge, soft spine) is not the only method of forging. If its monosteel katana, it won't have a soft spine. Or if it's made makuri style it has a soft ""core"" but a hard spine."
SWORDS,3caxws,thereddaikon,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:29:12 2015 UTC,"I was thinking more traditional blades rather than modern reproductions. I know there are lots of variations on traditional forging, but the soft cores have less spring and are more likely to take a bend than fully tempered blades. From what I understand people bend them doing tameshigiri fairly often."
SWORDS,3caxws,ellendar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:56:08 2015 UTC,Possible but highly unlikely. Swords did break and can break but the forces required are often not great enough in combat. The best way to break a traditionally made katana would be to place the tip in a vice and bend it to the side and it would be more likely to bend permanently than break anyways. Iron and steel are malleable and tend to bend rather than break. Actual breaking becomes a problem if the steel is too hard for its own good.

SWORDS,3bvlur,jwbviii,6,Thu Jul 2 14:48:10 2015 UTC,"Based on the address on the shirasaya, this sword was likely confiscated after WWII.  The nakago signature is simply 鈴 (suzu).  The address, 板橋区中村町 (Itabashi-ku Nakamura-machi) plus some numbers, existed in Tokyo between 1932 and 1947. Since 1947, the area has been designated as 練馬区中村 (Nerima-ku Nakamura)."
SWORDS,3bvlur,kenkyuukai,6,Thu Jul 2 17:37:00 2015 UTC,"The one character of the nakago is a bit odd. It doesn't really look like a mei per se, not in terms of chiseling quality, linguistic patterns nor traditional signature styles. Sort of a mystery to me. There are a smattering of smiths who included Suzuki 鈴木 in part of their mei but nobody just signing 鈴.  OP, the blade is obviously not in great condition. Most of the rust could be polished off I think, but a bigger concern for me is the kissaki, which looks to have been repaired/shortened at one point; not sure if the bōshi is totally there still. Very straight style somewhat suggests it is ca. Kanbun period, ~1661. Evidence of good hada in a couple photos. Hamon maybe suguba but can't see much detail.  Whole nakago looks a bit wonky, especially around the habakimoto. I believe it has been shortened or else altered in some way. The hi termination is a bit awkward at both ends, definitely seems to be ato-bi (added after the fact).  It might look nice after polish but I'm not convinced that it would be worth the steep expense in this case. I'd bring it to a show/club to get more in-hand opinions.  Regards,  —G."

For a hilt, it would be Christian Fletcher. He's the only person who has access to Albion's Next Generation bare blades. Another great option for hilts would be Ernie at Yeshua's Sword.

SWORDS,3brs97,Vennificus,8,Wed Jul 1 19:46:02 2015 UTC,"Mechapope1 covered the bases well.  On a pure performance level, very few people came close to Gus Trim when it comes to medieval euros--his work on harmonics, weight distribution and polar moment of inertia was as good as they come, but he's not really making blades any more.  He used to work with Albion, their methods are similar and their blades are also high performers, with clean lines.  Christian Fletcher is one of the best cutlers for building a custom hilt on an existing blade, and his partnership with Albion is likely the best combination for performance and hilts in this kind of project, outside of a full custom build from a single smith with a long waitlist.  Christian has a long and proven track record of custom hilts. In wishful thinking land, the skills of somebody like Jake Powning or Peter Johnsson would be the top place to get a fine Euro hilt for a medieval, but they don't really take on commissions--they work on their own projects."

SWORDS,3br2pj,NiceGuyChuck,6,Wed Jul 1 13:42:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  It's not traditional Japanese (at best it would be a WWII piece, but the state of the nakago is too clean even for the stainless kai-guntō). But it's also not a wallhanger or fake. The nakago (tang) is clean, decently shaped, with moderately careful yasurime (file marks) and a well-drilled mekugi-ana (peg hole). The hamon is not traditional, might be oil quench or cosmetic, and it's been enhanced via polish which masks the true nature. Cannot see the hada (grain) in these pics. Sugata (profile) is decent, lines not terrible. Wish I could see the kissaki (point).  Two possibilities come to mind: it's an amateur piece in the Japanese style, or a production sword by one of the Chinese companies. I really have very little way to tell. One thing that bugs me is that the angle of the nakago is very traditional, much more Japanese than most production companies or amateurs usually hit.  Worth $300? I guess I would say that depends on the quality of the heat treatment. This isn't exactly an art-grade piece but neither is it junk. If the heat treatment is good it would probably make a nice cutter. Not sure how to assess the value of a mystery like this TBH.  Personally I'd save that $300 and spend it on a better-defined item.

What are you planning on doing with it? If you want a cutter for dojo or backyard cutting and martial arts practice, you could spend the same amount and get a pretty decent sword from Huawei, Hanwei, or any other number of other chinese production forges.

SWORDS,3bp3dm,KonungrSears,3,Wed Jul 1 19:49:26 2015 UTC,"This is somewhat unrelated, but i've been curious about trying katana/tachi/wakizashi/etc in a HEMA style fight and decent steel simulators are from few to nonexistant (and expensive for what they are).  Since those swords are for fighting they tend to get dented and such, so decoration should be from minimal to none (to the point where maybe menuki could be skipped, though i've heard they perform some function by filling the palm of the hand), with the most functional tsuba, correct weight and balance, and a blade made for sparring (2-3mm edge, rounded point, flexible enough for thrusts but not so much that the blade would be floppy).  I know we HEMAists are a PitA to cater to, but if you can make that for a reasonable price (most swords seem to start at ~200€ for something decent, up to Albion prices at ~500€ for production but top quality) you may actually get a market going. And maybe the kenjutsu people will like it and start fighting, i'd sure like to see that."

Likewise, the fit of the saya is more important than most manufacturers seem to think."

SWORDS,3bp3dm,thereddaikon,2,Wed Jul 1 17:11:32 2015 UTC,Possible to have a copper habaki and stay in that price range?  I really would like to see some patterns on the habaki like the cat scratch pattern.
SWORDS,3bp3dm,carasci,2,Wed Jul 1 04:27:11 2015 UTC,I'm seeing that you guys don't care much about the Tsuba and cord wrappings as long as the steel is functional. So you guys wouldn't mind a monotempered blade with no hamon as long as it was sharp as hell and heat treated correctly for durability?
SWORDS,3bp3dm,some_random_kaluna,3,Wed Jul 1 11:53:13 2015 UTC,"At that price point performance and durability are far more important than looks. Fake rayskin and cotton wrap are fine. What is key is a good durable blade that cuts well and feels alive. One of the nice things about katana are their ability to have the mountings upgraded with little effort. Just pop the peg and you can replace everything. If someone wants nicer fittings they will do this on their own. I've seen a few people do custom mountings for mass produced katana. What is important is the thing you cannot change, the blade. 5160 mono tempered is fantastic. It will out perform AISI 10xx and is still reasonably cheap and works great for just about every sword style. The temper, balance and grind are key though. That's where the money should go. As far as the mountings are solid, not gaudy and easy to replace then they are not a concern. Many real katana had simplistic mountings anyway so pick a real style that's cheap to massproduce and go with it. Don't waste time with gimmicks such as differential hardening or steel folding. 5160 works best mono tempered and has a very faint hamon if it is differentially hardened. That kind of aesthetic is meant for higher end pieces that can afford to perform well and look good."

SWORDS,3bp3dm,KillKennyG,3,Thu Jul 2 14:56:24 2015 UTC,"If the tsuka is going to have a cord wrapping (tsukaito), it absolutely has to be done right - no tsukaito is better than bad tsukaito.  Personally, the tsukaito is very characteristic of Japanese swords, and while there are some nice pieces that skip it I wouldn't suggest you do so.  For a mid-range functional sword (i.e. practice cutter), I'd say that your key characteristics are:   Durability - a decent steel is essential, but monotempered is fine so long as it performs well and is advertised as such. Weight/balance - the only thing worse than an blade that will nick/break/bend from average use (not abuse, no katana will stand up to chopping through metal or trees and you don't want to try to make one) is one that feels dead in the hand.  Do some research there and experiment with it (particularly the distal taper) until you have something that behaves.  Blade geometry is not the place to skimp, because no steel will save a badly-designed blade. Fit (not finish) of the tsuka - the tsuka should be fairly precisely fitted to the nakago, no wiggle whatsoever, everything should feel solid but not heavy.  Two mekugi are an absolute necessity, and as someone else mentioned it'd cost you almost nothing to throw in a spare or two but people would love you for it.  Tsukaito needs to be extremely tight - if it starts to loosen after a couple months of use, it wrecks the feel of the sword and there's no quick or easy fix. Fit (likewise, not finish) of the saya - it doesn't have to be pretty, but a fair number of people in the ""functional sword"" crowd do cut on the draw (as in iaido etc.), and you can't do it properly or smoothly if the saya fits the sword poorly.   Things that don't matter:   Ornamentation.  Period.  For a purely functional sword, a fake hamon, fancy carved menuki/tsuba/kashira/etc. and other such things are expenses that could have gone into the important fit/performance aspects or off the final price.  In most cases it's pretty easy to offer a ""pretty"" model next to the performance model, but even if you can't so long as it's done with proper mekugi it's easy enough for an end-user to take it apart and replace the tsuba etc."
SWORDS,3bp3dm,megacore123444,2,Wed Jul 1 16:45:40 2015 UTC,"You're probably not paying attention to this anymore, but I would ask that you please offer synthetic rayskin or a different grip surface in place of regular rayskin. Mantas are getting more endangered every day and I can forego some authenticity in exchange for not killing an animal.   As far as the other wrappings go, if we like it we're more inclined to customize it ourselves or just buy a high-end sword. Function over form for this one."
SWORDS,3bp3dm,meatmetomorrow,2,Thu Jul 2 16:38:55 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for anybody else, but I right now I already own enough of the black Tsuka with a black saya style Katana.

SWORDS,3bp3dm,Anen-o-me,2,Wed Jul 1 12:17:33 2015 UTC,"besides the many good comments, if like to throw in my .02: so many modern katana come in just black, or bright colors like red or yellow, occasionally brown. some of the finest art-level swords I've seen have used a dark moss green saya/brown cord color scheme with simple iron fittings. This color scheme is conservative but distinct, and colorful without being crass. it would also set your new line apart from the million other black katanas avaliable. just a thought!"

SWORDS,3boths,Azekh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:57:55 2015 UTC,"If that's for each sword it you should consider getting something custom made. As far as katana go you won't be getting top of the line traditional made for that, but for the rest you can get something quite nice.  I'm no expert on custom makers however, i know Patrick Barta who is cheap for what he does, but can easily end up outside your budget, Vladimir Cervenka who isn't as great but is also a lot cheaper. From what i hear about Cervenka and read on Barta's site both seem to suffer from making things a tad heavy though. If handling is a big concern you may be better off with an Albion (which isn't custom, but maybe they have some options in that regard).  If that budget is total you probably want production swords rather than customs. There's still nice stuff out there however. For European blades at reasonable prices there are quite a few makers in Eastern Europe who make good blades for rather cheap. I've handled swords by Peter Regenyei, Szymon Chlebowski (beware delivery dates with him), Pavel Moc, Jan Chodkiewicz, and Viktor Berbekucz, they're all well made, though some are prettier, some handle better, etc. They cater more to HEMA (fights with blunt steel) than collectors however.  I can't help much with katana, but apparently some Chinese stuff can actually be decent and reasonably cheap. Just beware the tons of crap."
SWORDS,3bnxsm,boomhauer90,27,Tue Jun 30 19:03:32 2015 UTC,"Tactical, adjective: • (of bombing or weapons) done or for use in immediate support of military or naval operations.

""Tactical"" meaning black, angular, skeletonized etc. is a casual aesthetic usage of the word with no objective measure and no actual importance."

SWORDS,3bnxsm,some_random_kaluna,11,Tue Jun 30 22:39:17 2015 UTC,"Kukri knives are generally tactical enough for modern purposes; the Royal Ghurkas of Nepal still issue, train--and use--them. Here's what they look like.  This model is about 17 inches long, which makes it long enough as a machete and short enough to use quickly and effectively. Machetes would be today's tactical swords; sharp and heavy enough to use as tools for a wide variety of applications as well as a weapon, without a burdensome length. They'll often have reduced hand guards to protect you from cutting your fingers off, rather than enlarged guards to protect you during sword fighting."

Maybe if you post pictures someone will have a really bright idea, i'm not sure attaching something to the holes is going to be very sturdy.  For what it's worth historical sword handles tend to be two pieces of wood around the tang, possibly cord over it, then leather, then mostly decorative things (but sometimes somewhat functional for a better grip) like twisted wire, tinner strips of leather crossed or making round ridges (those can also be made by putting thick cord under the leather), etc."

But to make a Proper handle Id need to trim the metal sides down and create a strip of metal to build the handle around thus shortening the blade. (Which id prefer actually) but I have nothing to cut the metal with hand tool wise. And its not FULL size but still big.

Obviously a few of the shorter range techniques must be modified due to the lack of an actual pole but the true range, movement requirements and power/momentum marry themselves perfectly to the large, heavy greatswords. Also, because Quan Dao training focuses greatly on wrist, elbow and shoulder strength; wielding a normally 'unwieldy' weapon like a greatsword becomes rather easy."

The montante or zweihander was more often than not used in formation warfare along with pike squares and halbederes, and is more analogous in use to the same.  I would use an underarm halfswording stance, and if the blade had secondary quillons or a flared ricasso, attempt to trap my opponent's blade and try to thrust in on his sword side.  Alternatively, a momentum carrying flourish rapidly attacking and threatening low and high.  Or shield bash and close with a dagger/katzbalger."
SWORDS,3bdot1,60for30,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:07:54 2015 UTC,What i've read of Iberian montante seems to imply the standard tactic was to aim for the legs taking advantage of the greater reach. From what i understood they seemed to be roughly horizontal cuts mostly.

For me personally it isn't very comfortable to use without gloves but for smaller hands it's fine.  That particular model seems to be a one of a kind deal. Viktor sometimes experiments with historical designs that are too complex for mass production and this rapier is the result of one of those experiments.  Armory Marek has some nice rapiers as well but I didn't really like the balance of those they had for sale last week. My girlfriend and I both aren't especially strong so we prefer lighter weapons with the point of balance as far back as possible but that's pretty much personal taste.

They can be used one handed, though they're a bit heavy for that it takes a fair amount of practice and skill to do it.   As stated by others, there's a style, not widely spread anymore, called Nito (two swords) Ichi (One) Ryu (School), so two swords as one. Mostly called Niten (two heavens), but the founder of this style referred to it as Nito occasionally.  Generally, in today's schools, the katana and wakizashi are used separately. You use either or, but rarely together. The style of Iaido I teach uses both, but by far the majority of it is katana (actually, an Iaito, practice sword, non sharp) only. There are sets of kata that use the wak, but usually only for advanced students. In kenjitsu (or kenjutsu) it's either and sometimes both, but bokken (wooden swords) are much easier to handle than steel."

SWORDS,3ba2l3,Azekh,3,Sat Jun 27 08:56:23 2015 UTC,"Having studied Iaido for 3 years I would say both. Most moves are done using both hands for at least the finish of the manouevre but a significant number are done with just one. Bear in mind that it is common in many Japanese styles to cut from the draw- e.g. battojutsu, the name means just that- which you don't see in western styles very often, if at all. To draw a Katana whilst wearing it, you hold the saya (scabbard) with one hand so you can only draw with (the other) one. I don't think that you have anything like the distinction you would get in western styles where often either the sword can physically only go in one hand, e.g. a rapier, or else the sword is of such size,e.g. longsword, that you put yourself at a significant disadvantage using it single-handed in most cases.  Examples (note that these aren't just separate schools but separate arts, as for instance Judo and Aikido are):   Kenjutsu- you can see some single handed work at 30"" here but you can see that much is 2-handed Niten Ichi-ryu - some others here have mentioned this. Here is a demonstration including two sword kata Battojutsu- You can see a demonstration here with many single and double handed cuts from the draw in response to attacks. Iaido- the art that I study. In this art the opponent is imaginary so it may be harder to understand what is going on but again you can see the blend of single and two handed work in this demonstration."

I tend to agree with your friend, because without the context of being in a half-sword grip, the strike makes no sense.    Also, as a note, I do not think of a mordhau as a club like attack, but rather like a hammer/pick or even a bearded axe.  You can use the cross-guards to pull your opponent, there are several lovely disarms from the murderstroke, as well as try to concuss your opponent."

I generally like to do a Zornhau zum Mordhau transition by doing an Abschneiden longer than normally so that I can get back into a Zornort and try to do the Mordhau from there.  It's just the motion that It's easier to do so from a Short-Sword. Also I tend to aim with the crossgurard to get a nice piercing strike when I do so.

It is the capital of the province of Toledo and the autonomous community of Castile–La Mancha. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1986 for its extensive cultural and monumental heritage and historical co-existence of Christian, Muslim and Jewish cultures.  Toledo is known as the ""Imperial City"" for having been the main venue of the court of Charles I, and as the ""City of the Three Cultures"", having been influenced by a historical co-existence of Christians, Muslims and Jews. In 1085, the city fell to Alfonso VI of Castile as the first major city in the Christian Reconquista. Toledo has a history in the production of bladed weapons, which are now popular souvenirs of the city.  People who were born or have lived in Toledo include Al-Zarqali, Garcilaso de la Vega, Eleanor of Toledo, Alfonso X and El Greco. It was also the place of important historic events such as the Visigothic Councils of Toledo. As of 2012 [update], the city has a population of 84,019 and an area of 232.1 km2 (89.6 sq mi).

SWORDS,3ambl5,Grandmaster_C,10,Sun Jun 21 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"You should be looking over in /r/wma. Personally I use a Rawlings, but the Pentiis and Blackfencers are better. Putting grip tape on them helps more. The Kriegsmesser is a bit of a shift from the Longsword, a single edge loses out on versatility and only mildly increases cutting power, Beautiful weapon though.  German longsword (the style) revolves around mostly Oakeshott types XVa and XVIII(abc, works with d and e).  In context, the Liechtenauer school is largely unarmored, duelling, and efficient. Fiore, the most common italian counterpart is much more fundamental, it takes an equal amount of skill to master both, but liechtenauer focused on defeating other longsword masters. Later writers like Talhoffer (alias: Trollhoffer)  helped exemplify the versatility of the longsword. Even in PVD, one of the most common sources for the liechtenauer school, the longsword is used as a piercing, slashing, and bludgeoning weapon. It is used in both medium range and close range combat, fiore includes a way to throw the sword like a javelin (I have done this once and it is ALWAYS a surprise). In PVD there are techniques for an armored opponent, for an unarmored opponent. In other parts of german lineage there are techniques for horseback, for mixed weapons, etc; Most of this is rather nondescript of the style and the german schools are best known for their work in the bind. Sword on Sword Contact. Duplieren, Winden, etc; are techniques that are rare among sword styles (La Verdadera destreza being a notable exception and a beautiful one at that) Liechtenauer through PVD, Talhoffer, Kal and Dobringer is the style I study as well. My brother does Fiore.  The longsword as a weapon is, in my (studied) opinion, the most versatile weapon in the sword world. It can be used one or two handed (it does better with two). It is a long weapon but short enough to sit on a stool or move through a house or hall without knocking everything over. It can be used at all ranges, it can be used as a riding, arming, or war sword, (increasing levels of conflict). As I mentioned, it is a piercing and slashing weapon of a great potency, and the cross can be used as a hammer when times need (Mordhau is best hau). The Pommel of the longsword can, in paraphrase of fiore ""take out the front four teeth of a man). It excels in none of these areas. The tuck will always pierce better. The Rapier is better for dueling, Greatswords of all types better for fighting off crowds and has longer reach. Short swords of all kinds work better indoors and hinder you less. Daggers are easier to conceal. But the european longsword is the best sword if you don't know what you are going to get into, because it can satisfy all needs more than passably.  You should probably look for the Pentii 3 synthetic at Purpleheart.. Make sure you have a mask, make sure you have a Jock, and if you can, put 3m friction tape on the edge to make it bind better.   Good Luck!"

The longer guards were probably there for functionality rather than looks.

SWORDS,3aizuk,Azekh,2,Sun Jun 21 00:16:47 2015 UTC,"""Better"" is a very relative term. Armor peaked as an encompassing piece in the 15th century. In the 16th century, when the sword in the video is from (late 16th at that), armor became less and less covering primarily due to the advancement of firearms.  If you look at depictions of people wielding these swords from around that time a lot of them look like this: 1 2. I'm not suggesting that they all looked like that but the trend was steadily moving away from heavier armor.  So the cross guard did in fact become more necessary and not less.

""Would it be possible with modern technology to produce a sword that would handily deal with medieval swords and armor?""  That's a whole other thing and the answer is no. It would be a bit better, possibly tend to bite into other swords instead of getting bitten into, maybe a thinner and sharper point would be possible so opening chain or getting between plates would be easier, but it wouldn't ""handily deal"" with anything, especially not compared to existing dedicated weapons of the time.  But for the question of this thread? Sure, and the farther back you go the more pronounced.

Although the chronological limits of the period are open to debate, the timeframe spans the period after the late portion of the post-classical age (c. 1500), known as the Middle Ages, through the beginning of the Age of Revolutions (c. 1800) and is variously demarcated by historians as beginning with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, with the Renaissance period, and with the Age of Discovery (especially with the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492, but also with the discovery of the sea route to the East in 1498), and ending around the French Revolution in 1789. Historians in recent decades have argued that from a worldwide standpoint, the most important feature of the early modern period was its globalizing character.  The period witnessed the exploration and colonization of the Americas and the rise of sustained contacts between previously isolated parts of the globe. The historical powers became involved in global trade. This world trading of goods, plants, animals, and food crops saw exchange in the Old World and the New World. The Columbian exchange greatly affected the human environment.

Rather than digging up sources and museum archives, we can use our imagination instead, and in this case, it works.  Let me elaborate:  imagine you owned this weapon and relied upon it with your life.  That already means it's going with you everywhere, so convenience is a huge factor here, as it was for all swords.  This one in particular has blades coming out both sides, so now if you want to bend forwards, backwards, or sideways, you have one digging into your gut, brushing up against your elbows all the time, and that's just going to be annoying. A situation arises and now you need it- but your opponent is also armed with a sword of his own- nothing fancy, just a single blade.  The tonfa blades are at a huge disadvantage here also- limited range, a single glance can sever your forearm, and you really have no cutting capability either.  The best here is the thrust, and even that can be done effectively with the short end, and the long side lacks stability because of the awkward grip placement.    TL;DR: No, I don't think so, but thank you for spicing this subreddit up a bit."
SWORDS,3a8pxj,Jack0fHearts18,5,Thu Jun 18 04:54:57 2015 UTC,"The closest would be push daggers, particularly katars. Though notably, the blade is typically aligned with the center of the handle for stabbing, and there's only one blade. Some modern fencing swords have what is called a pistol grip for ergonomy (when all you do is thrust the blade). This kind of a grip can be found also on some sword canes and maybe some sabres, but again there's only one blade with the pistol grip.  Two-blades (meaning two-pointed) swords are quite rare. There's the Chinese ""cicada wing sword"", but its use has more common with a halberd than a sword. Chinese call all single-bladed cutting weapons ""dao"", including knives, sabres and halberds. The ""cicada wing"" looks like that Klingon thing."

A lot of REALLY odd blades, swords and combination weapons exist in only single digits though, so it's not impossible.  Basically someone took some tonfa (japanese martial arts weapons, basically the handle from a grinder used to fight with) and thought it would be cool to add a blade.  Traditionally these are blunt weapons as they are designed to not look out of place amongst peasants (who were not supposed to be sporting weapons, as it was against the law and could lead to them being executed).  There might be some bladed versions out there (historically speaking), but they would be extremely rare most likely.  So no...no real historical basis, they just looked cool to the movie folks.  There is even a Jedi in star wars that supposedly uses this style with light sabers, but she is in the Force Unleashed Games and I do not believe they consider those games canon in the Star Wars Universe."

SWORDS,3a5bby,Jack0fHearts18,2,Wed Jun 17 14:07:11 2015 UTC,"Great!  Thanks for the reference.  I like Cold Steel swords, too.  I own the Gim and the small sword.  Hoping to get the Italian longsword soon.    Now that I'm better equipped to help you out, can you identify where the struggle is?  I do this by placing the tip of the blade in the scabbard and slowly moving it into the sheath until the resistance is felt.  Once we get an indication of where the issue is, we'll take it from there. From experience, I can tell you that this is most likely going to be a semi-lengthy process with sandpaper or a file.  :)"
SWORDS,3a5bby,Jack0fHearts18,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:51:52 2015 UTC,Ah nice! Yeah the Italian Longsword looks great.  It's pretty much right at the crossguard at the top of the scabbard. I managed to push the sword in all the way before but it took me a good few minutes and a slight bruise on my hand to pull it out again haha. I'm guessing there is just a bit too much wood at the top?
SWORDS,3a5bby,Jack0fHearts18,2,Wed Jun 17 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"Yes the wood lining may be the issue, and that is preferable as opposed to the metal fitting around the mouth of the scabbard.  Can you confirm its the wood?"
SWORDS,3a5bby,Azekh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:38:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's just like on the image I sent earlier, metal on the outside but then a wooden core, which I think is where the sword is catching.   I've noticed it loosening up slightly, but I think I may file a bit of it down when I get the chance."
SWORDS,3a5bby,Azekh,2,Thu Jun 18 09:31:37 2015 UTC,"I would recommend filing the wooden core from left to right, using an even counting of strokes from forward to back.  To do this effectively, place the file into the scabbard and file each section.  The sections will be measured by the length of the file- which, it it's a tiny file, shouldn't be more than an inch across."

As a sword nut and albion fanboy, have you seen the Arctic Fire seminars? In 2012 he gave a talk that is possibly my favorite hour of entertainment, ever. Here's the entire thing, but I demand that you watch the PJ section if you haven't already: http://www.bladesmithsforum.com/index.php?showtopic=23706  Also, some feedback for your videos! (Not that you asked, but I'll be revisiting your channel for new reviews, so I might as well drop in my 2c)  Really great stuff overall, but a few little things:    you probably don't need to read out all of the specifications when they are up in the screen. It's great to see them all, but I immediately skim them then skip forward in the video. What might be better is to put them up on the screen, then comment on any particularly interesting or noteworthy dimension. Then move on. If we need to reference it, we will. Unless someone is visually impaired, there's no reason to actually read each measurement aloud. overall the presentation is very good, but we can tell you're reading from a script (or memorized) and delivering it as a conversation. What might make it authentically conversational is if you give yourself bullet points and actually try to wing it on camera. It may or may not work (it's not easy I'm sure), but you may like the end result better. (Obviously for parts like the history less of the gallowglasses a script is appropriate -- that section was really great by the way.)

SWORDS,39s6l7,Pentonics,13,Sun Jun 14 06:10:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry...you don't even know if you want a rapier or a longsword?  Do you have any idea of the kind of fight you're intending to put on?  This doesn't seem like a production with a proper stunt coordinator or armorer, let alone proper safety procedures.    Your ""buy two, blunt one"" plan is alarming for several reasons.  But it all boils down to this:  you don't ever have a live (sharp) blade on a film set. Full stop.  For the same reason you don't ever have actors handle loaded guns. In fact, the safety protocol for weapons on film sets are similar in both cases.  At any rate, even the most detailed 'hero' props for use in closeups are never sharpened.  By the same token, sword props used for fighting are constructed as blunts and have geometry specifically made to support the blunt edge---not simply sharps that have had their edges ground down. Grinding down a sharp to use as a full-contact blunt will either result in an edge too thin for safety or require so much removal of steel that the structural integrity of the blade itself is compromised.  ONLY purpose-made blunts should be used for stage or film fighting.       An overview of standard set protocol: * Training (Pre-production). In a controlled environment, the Director, AD, and performers need to be individually evaluated, familiarized and trained to handle the weapons in question under the supervision of a qualified instructor, usually affiliated with the Armorer. *  Supervision At no time shall weapons be used on set without the Armorer or Weapon Handler immediately supervising their use. * Armorer's Area Whether the Armorer is set up at a fixed area on stage or a mobile cart on location, no one without supervision is to enter the immediate Armorer area. Weapons must be under the direct control of the Armorer or Weapon Handlers(which may include the trained performers) at all times. * No 'Playing' Allowed. No one shall 'play' with a weapon outside of designated rehearsal or blocking, even rubber stunt casts. Besides the inherent danger of uncontrolled hot points, ""playing"" with replicas creates the perception that the production is a dangerous work environment. *  Calling 'CUT!' ANYONE may call 'cut!' at any time to halt the action, if a threat to anyone's personal safety is discovered while the camera is rolling. *  The Safety Briefing The AD, in conjunction with the armorer, reiterates the safety procedures on each day of operation, especially for the benefit of any new cast or crew members and to reaffirm for the rest of the cast and crew that all safety procedures remain in effect.  Everyone on set is made aware of the specific demands of the filmed sequences for that day and the associated safety protocol.  This is NOT the time for safety training, which should have occurred before filming.  In addition to the filming schedule, an overview of each scheduled sequence will be provided to the Armorer, identifying which Performers will be handling weapons as well as a description of the dramatic goals of each sequence. The Armorer must consult with the Director to determine how best to achieve dramatic goals within safety margins. * Filming Procedures.  Each action involving weapons to be filmed MUST be rehearsed with unedged weapons with the Armorer present BEFORE FILMING to eliminate any confusion among the performers. Before a filmed sequence, the Armorer must clear and check the condition of the weapon. The Armorer renders the set ""Hot"" and turns the weapon over to the performer to use in the scene.  The Armorer keeps their eyes on the weapon at all times until it is returned to their custody.  The performers execute their actions as rehearsed, aborting filming if there is a problem.  After the cameras stop rolling, the weapons are immediately returned to the custody of the Armorer, who checks them and prepares to repeat the process from the beginning.    All that being said, blunts for filming are often custom-made for the specific production, but there are some affordable production blunts out there that I've seen used on productions of all sizes. A good standard workhorse is the Hanwei practical Hand-and-a-Half. It's a staple for a reason, it looks decent and handles fairly well, and it's cheap.  There are also rapiers, mortuary hilts, and single-handers in that product line.  Somewhat confusingly, Hanwei uses the ""Practical"" moniker to denote their stage combat blades when talking about their euro swords, but for their Japanese blades they use the same term to mean sharps.  Yikes.    As mentioned, there are also affordable blunts in the Hanwei/Tinker line, like the Longsword and the Single Hander.  These swords have plainer appearances but better handling.  They are meant to match up with the same Sharps in the Tinker line."
SWORDS,39s6l7,MoonSpider,5,Sun Jun 14 17:10:09 2015 UTC,I do not have much knowledge on the process of weapon handling in film so I posted my question with my questionable intentions in the hope someone would correct me. Righteous correctors give the most detailed answers.  I'm glad you told me not to grind down anything. I was actually going to do that. In the interest of maintaining continuity it didn't seem like a completely terrible idea at the time.  I asked for rapier and longswords suggestions because I wasn't sure what kind of fight we're doing yet and the whole thing is still in the development stages. I wanted to see all of the affordable options.  This is exactly what I wanted. Thank you Lord MoonSpider. I will copy this and save it forever.

Many have claimed to have received rusted or faulty merchandise which was unusually difficult to be refunded or be replaced. Some also accuse DSA of not actually making their own swords. (Check out MyArmoury.com).   The quality of DSA swords is midline at best. They're a step above Windlass, and nowhere near an Albion. I've handled them and find them to be a tad bit blade heavy.  They're sharpened beaters rather than balanced swords in my experience. The suspension of the scabbard pictured is also not of the correct style for the Viking Age.   My recommendation would be to save up a little bit longer and just get an Albion. Albions surpass all other swords on the market in quality,  design, and balance. That being said,  you won't be getting a scabbard with it. Custom scabbards start at around $700.  Ask yourself what you really want: affordability or quality.  Then make your decision from there. For the money DSA is fine,  but you definitely get what you pay for when it comes to swords."

An Albion and high quality scabbard (if well maintained) will last a lifetime. Just remember it's mild steel, so you need to keep it oiled. And for God's sake don't touch the blade with your grubby hands. Brush it down with an oiled cloth after each handling and give it a good cleaning after every cutting. Don't do stupid things like hack at wood or metal. If you do all that, your sword will last a very long time. I most certainly don't regret the extra money I spent on my Albions.

SWORDS,39f7ea,mightandmagic88,5,Thu Jun 11 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"Gorgeous! I have to say, this is very very close to how I pictured a heron-marked blade. Something about the geometry of the guard is really pleasing to the eye. The scabbard is just as pleasing to look at as the sword itself, and even the buckle is detailed. I think the sword in the book was described as rather simple, and scarcely ornamented, but I like this ornate take on it as well.  I've seen a few different takes on replicating the swords mentioned in the books, but I think the nice thing about heron-marked blades was that they weren't all alike. They were all curved, as that seemed to be the style of blade used in general in the books, but the only feature to really distinguish a heron blade from any old sword was the mark itself, the durability of the weapon, and the skill of the wielder.   I recall that as Rand (the main character) came up against different swordmasters, descriptions of their blades varied to some degree. The one I would like to see someone attempt to make would be the Seanchan style sword. I don't remember who used it, but the description of that sword was that it was two-handed, and had a longer and much broader blade than Rand's sword. I almost pictured it as a two-handed falchion, and I'd love to see someone make such a sword with the same grace and attention to detail as this one. For that matter, I'd love to see an attempt at making Seanchan armor with modern materials."

SWORDS,39hpkd,ColonelBunkyMustard,4,Fri Jun 12 14:16:22 2015 UTC,"Came here to mention those, but you beat me to it. Because of the historical Japanese rigidity with regards to weapon styling (and the cultural issues present during the relevant period), it's actually easier to find western blades with blades similar to the katana etc. than Japanese blades with western-style hilts. The kriegsmesser and grossemesser (for an even more katana-esque example, take a look at this https://swordsmithvs.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/kriegmesser.jpg?w=900&h=657) are probably the most distinct examples, though some dussacks also come close.  As for why they aren't common, I'd say the answer is twofold. In period, the Japanese were pretty rigid and traditional about their sword designs, and their occasional fascination with the West was still coupled with xenophobia (particularly with regards to traditional/cultural items like the katana), so they weren't about to go experimenting. In the West, on the other hand, things like the kriegsmesser did exist, but were never massively popular because they didn't perform all that well against the type and quality of armor available at that point. (The grossemesser is a special case, as it was primarily a civilian self-defense weapon and armor wasn't a major factor.)  As for why they aren't available now, my guess would be that it comes down to buyer dynamics, plus the long-standing separation of Western and Eastern swords in the public consciousness: it's an interesting idea, but nobody's really all that interested in it. The WMA and JTA communities wouldn't really see the point, the mall ninjas are all ""OMG KATANAAAA, why would you pollute the sword that cuts through tanks with your Western garbage,"" most buyers of wallhangers etc. wouldn't know what to do with it, and the handful of people getting high-end commissions tend to be picky and specific. That pretty much leaves the experimental crowd (people like me, who would be interested in seeing how the change/combination would interact with both forms of historical swordsmanship despite the combination itself being largely ahistorical), which isn't enough for any major makers to bother."
SWORDS,39hpkd,carasci,2,Fri Jun 12 16:31:03 2015 UTC,"How would you recommend going about getting one? I'd say it would be best to obtain a katana blade of the highest possible quality, preferably from a Japanese smith, and then have someone grind down the tang and create a solid custom hilt over here. That way one could adequately judge its performance compared to conventional blades of both styles."
SWORDS,39hpkd,carasci,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:55:36 2015 UTC,"The nature of the katana tang doesn't really present an issue for the crossguard, so at that point it would mostly be a question of the grip configuration.  Personally, I wouldn't want to go grinding down the tang  of a blade of any quality, so the better way to go would likely be to do a scaled grip like so - though I don't think that was common for the kriegsmesser, it's definitely an authentic construction for the grossemesser and some of those were about the right length.  Scaled vs. solid doesn't make an enormous difference in terms of handling (it does affect how the pommel is dealt with, though), and since a good blade would be worth far more than the fittings it'd be better to build the fittings to it rather than the other way around.  That being said, unless you're interested in a personal piece (i.e. something you'd show off, be proud of and cut with), there's really no need to get a particularly high-quality blade.  The cutting potential isn't affected all that much by the type of guard (a bit, but nothing massive), so that can be assessed independently.  On the other hand, the way in which the guard changes the weapon's usage doesn't depend all that much on blade quality, so long as the blade has the right general properties - the edge geometry and steel can be off like crazy so long as the balance, length and curvature are roughly correct.  Yes, it's a bit more complicated than that and there are some important subtleties, but by and large the different guard would be far more noticeable than the difference between a trainer blade and a quality one."
SWORDS,39hpkd,gabedamien,6,Fri Jun 12 20:16:27 2015 UTC,"This already exists in the form of Meiji/Taisho-period kyū-guntō (early military swords), which were often katana blades in western saber mounts.  As to longsword-style crossguards or complex / basket hilts, it would certainly be possible to make a sword like this. The traditional nakago (tang) of a katana would have to be made much narrower, more like a western sword, to have the same hilt construction, but there's nothing physically preventing the type from being forged."

(from the experience of knowing a smith who has had to do some questionable at best fantasy commissions).   The reason traditional smiths did not use western hilt designs often is they are not suited for the style of sword, the same way you would not see a bastard sword hilt on a small sword blade: the sword types are used in specific ways rendering certain hilt designs pointless for that style of sword. Moreover the type of hilt you use may dictate the swords use, for example one of the key points of a katana is the ability to move ones hands and grip; a basket hilt would render this useless.   some aspects of western hilts were adopted later on but only for western style warfare: http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/32315025701_1/AA-Military-Japanese-Manchukuo-Sabre-Army-font-b-Cavalry-b-font-font-b-Sword-b-font.jpg this may be what you are looking for."

Today, it is still sometimes used poetically to refer to the island. The name for Scotland in the Celtic languages is related to Albion: Alba in Scottish Gaelic, Alba (genitive Alban, dative Albain) in Irish, Nalbin in Manx and Alban in Welsh, Cornish and Breton. These names were later Latinised as Albania and Anglicised as Albany, which were once alternative names for Scotland.  New Albion and Albionoria (""Albion of the North"") were briefly suggested as names of Canada during the period of the Canadian Confederation.   Captain Arthur Phillip originally named the Sydney Cove ""New Albion"", but for uncertain reasons the colony acquired the name ""Sydney"".

The sword doesn't look like historical Han dynasty sword and it doesn't exactly resemble most of the Zhanma Daos (horse-cutting swords) either.  If you have $300 and you're in the U.S., the Hanwei cutting sword is within your price range. Doesn't look very blingy, but is made for cutting. There are probably other Chinese straight swords within the same price range. The site I linked has a very good reputation. The designer of that sword also has a site, but the other swords there might be out of the price range.  I understand that Sinosword.com is reputable, so if you don't mind ordering from China, they do have a Zhanma Dao as one of their ""standard"" models for your BFS needs. (The cheaper swords there probably don't have perfect finish etc., but the blade itself should be the real deal. The ""showroom"" is for what they usually offer; they also do customs.)

SWORDS,39bhgv,SquiffSquiff,3,Wed Jun 10 18:37:15 2015 UTC,"I think that this is just a generally 'inspired by...' design. As /u/thereddaikon has said, there were lots of (different) Nazi daggers for different organisations. You see them at every antique arms fair. They were produced in great numbers  and there are many reproductions and fakes too. HOWEVER, this particular design does not look like any Nazi dagger I have seen:   It doesn't appear to match any actual examples of Nazi daggers as for instance here and here. It appears to be oversized for a dagger/bayonet and undersized for a sword. There are no mounting rings on the scabbard to fit it to a belt. The spine in the centre of the blade is very poorly defined. The cross on the pommel is not a sort that would have been used by the Nazis for this- it would have either been a swastika or 'Sun Wheel' (rounded swastika) as used on Luftwaffe swords and daggers. I have never seen a cross guard like that or embossed iron crosses like that on a Nazi dagger. The Nazis generally took more care about the shape of the hilt than seen here. That metal mouth on the scabbard has a design completely unrelated to either the Nazis or the rest of the dagger   In summary I am afraid that unless someone more knowledgeable can show differently then I would consider this a wall hanger item made to appeal to poorly informed admirers of the Nazis. I appreciate that this was a (presumably well-meant) gift and I would normally be more restrained here but on this occasion I will say that I would be ashamed to be in possession of such a thing myself. Whatever way you look at it it is an insult as you (now) knowingly have a poorly designed Nazi fan item that proclaims  ignorance to everyone with any knowledge in the field whilst at the same time announcing an apparent admiration of the Nazis.  On a more positive note, you could customise the scabbard to remove the swastika if you otherwise like the dagger. Alternatively if you want a 'real' Nazi dagger then I would advise purchasing a real one at an antique arms fair in your area or perhaps a reproduction. I cannot see any cause for a newly designed 'Nazi inspired' design in good conscience."

I've read accounts Napoleon's cavalry officers riding into battle with a pistol and saber in hand.  There are several accounts of the British officers during the affairs in India using their sabers and pistols consecutively, read Swordsman of the British Emoire for more details.  Also the idea of pirates using the cutlass and pistol come to mind.    So, if I were to give an opinion, I would say an infantry sabre.  But a cutlass and a smallsword(?), or a spadroon would also be good combinations. Mainly, you want it to be light, capable of the cut but more so the thrust, and one handed.  Edit: in case you're into the more Eastern side of things, Imperial Japanese officers during the Russo Japanese War up to the end of WWII used a shin gunto (military sword) and the Nambu pistol with promising results."

You could combine it with a schiavona, or even a sidesword.  But it isn't exactly the sort of thing done with medieval swords.

SWORDS,38v6yg,IrishPub,3,Sun Jun 7 03:03:20 2015 UTC,"I know the bloke.  I'll not mention his name for privacy/security reasons however - as you can imagine, a collection like that's more than a penny or two.  But he's a very nice chap, extremely knowledgeable about his period of interest - the late 13th C - hence the number of oakeshott XI - XIII's with wheel pommels in the collection. Has some beautiful transitional armour and a great living history standard of kit (tents, furniture, and the likes) -  A good number of the scabbards are Brian Kunz's work, though he also does his own stuff to a pretty high standard for an amateur craftsman (and I mean that in the best possible way). In particular a rather well-done modification of one of the Del tin 13th C falchions, which has transformed it from an ahistorical joke to a brilliant representation of the type, and an extensively modified Albion ""Baron"" that's been re-proportioned, given hew hilt furniture, and, as I understand it, bound with a lock of his wife's hair underneath the grip. Which I personally love as a detail that no commercial craftsman could've managed to include. That really is the sort of sword that becomes a family heirloom, and I don't doubt his son will cherish that someday in turn too.   Also, he has some superb armour -particularly a sugarloaf helm by Jeff Hildebrandt that I would consider one of the best reproductions of the type ever made.    Very nearly sold a quillon dagger spot-on for his period of interest to him earlier this year, but it got snapped up by a german collector. I'd have been honoured for it to go his way.    If you want to lust over his kit in person, do a search for ""Days of Knights"" - a yearly event at Kentucky's War Memorial Park on the weekend of 2-4 October, 2015. He's been a regular attendee there since the first event."

SWORDS,38vkji,SquiffSquiff,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:05:43 2015 UTC,"I didn't; I've done a bit of metal work and a ton of reading. This particular blade is considered not to be worth the cost of a traditional restoration due to the heavy oxidation/ pitting and lack of signature. I simply wanted to see how far I could take it without doing harm. In no way is it a traditional polish- the only similarity is the use of specific stones and an abundance of caution. It's a slow process, but it sure is fun."
SWORDS,38w08z,corvettee01,5,Sun Jun 7 08:18:30 2015 UTC,"This video by Matt Easton of Schola Gladiatoria explains it. Basically the side of the blade the ring is on faces away from your body. This is because, when holding the sword properly (not like a hammer), the back of your hand sticks out more than your thumb on the inside and thus needs more protection.   https://youtu.be/jfQmVQIgwa4"
SWORDS,38w08z,Saelyre,2,Sun Jun 7 13:15:30 2015 UTC,"They're for hand protection; the ring is held on the outside when the sword is drawn (away from your body).   You can find a few examples with rings on both sides (mainly on two handed specimens), but rings on one side is usually enough for one handed specimens as defending with the inside of the blade isn't terribly practical anyway."
SWORDS,38w08z,karlagius,3,Wed Jun 10 14:45:35 2015 UTC,"This is a educated guess as I have no real knowledge about swords, or fighting with them.  I suspect it is for protecting the hand, and preventing another sword from sliding down the blade. It wouldn't have gone on both sides for two reasons.  1) When in the scabbard it would be facing outwards so that when it was drawn, it would be on the user's outer side. If it was double sided, it would fig into the wearer's side and be an irritant.  2) In combat the side with that edge would be the one facing the enemy if that makes sense. It didn't need to be double sided because if someone got to that side of the blade, they would be in your defense and thus they would promptly run you through."
SWORDS,38w08z,Andrex992,2,Sun Jun 7 08:34:11 2015 UTC,"This came about the time when ""fingering"" the guard was becoming popular. Essentially, by adding more bars to the hilt in either a horizontal or vertical direction conferred more protection to a finger place over the crossbar, which was a technique used to increase stability and maneuverability of swords. These side rings eventually gave way to complex hilts.  Horizontal ones just protected the hand when held normally. Ones on the crossguard, facing the blade were for fingering https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfQmVQIgwa4"

This could imply that it is not an officers sword, as these tended to be better kept as the officers kept them once they left the army.

SWORDS,38uh36,ozonesmog,1 point,Sun Jun 7 04:35:39 2015 UTC,"when an officer was commissioned into the army, they were made to buy their own blades. For this reason when blades were issued to regular troops the army often did not use the best materials as it would be to expensive for the job required, this meant along with the fact that officers kept their baldes that non officer blades could become more easily rusted; and tended to be less well looked after.   Admittedly stainless steel was a slip of the tongue (keyboard, you know what I mean) I should have typed that they used a higher carbon steel for the blade as well as steel for the guard instead of iron, and in many cases the blade was blued and etched as the officer could afford this decoration; all making it a higher quality sword and less likely to rust."

In Japan, brides and newborns are often given/dedicated a kaiken — a protective dagger — in order to bring them good fortune. Historically, blades of all sizes were often presented as extremely high-class gifts between daimyō, almost to the point that it was expected. Some gimei (false signature) swords were indeed created, gifted, and accepted in this spirit. Then there are Jumyo blades, whose name is associated with luck and which were often gifted as luck charms. Oh yes, and of course receiving a long sword was a symbol of rank.  All in all, receiving a blade in Japan was usually quite an auspicious event."

SWORDS,38pbaa,Nick00105,12,Fri Jun 5 18:35:46 2015 UTC,"That depends, largely, on what TYPE of sword you want made, and also on your budget, timeline, and individual preferences.       Since you seem to post fairly frequently in situations referencing ASOIAF and LOTR, are you looking for a fantasy sword based on European medieval traditions?  Because then I'd recommend someone like Brendan Olszowy of Fableblades or someone like Christian Fletcher or someone like Rob Miller of Castle Keep.    Are you looking for a historically accurate viking sword?  Then I might recommend someone like Michael Pikula, Jeff Helmes, Robert Moc, or Patrick Barta.     Maybe you're more interested in late-medieval and renaissance swords, things with complicated hilts and swashbuckling romance?  I might recommend Craig Johnson from Arms & Armor.    Maybe you're big on historical accuracy, but your schedule can't accommodate a multi-year waitlist like some of the long-established smiths have.  Then I might recommend someone like Maciej Kopciuch.      Maybe you like good performance, but don't need a full tip-to-tale custom build, just a hilt of your design built on a solid blade for less than the price of a full-on custom project.  Then I might recommend Ernie at Yeshua's sword.    Maybe you're not interested in any of these---maybe you're interested in swords patterned after Japanese weaponry, or you specifically want a bronze-age khopesh.  There'd be a completely different list of recommendations. Do you see what I'm saying?  There's no one ""BEST site to have a custom sword made,"" because every custom project has individual priorities.    There are, however, a lot of bad places to have a custom sword made.  Research reputable smiths on dedicated sword forums and you're likely to find what you're after.  If you wander around google or ebay looking for ""custom swords"" you're likely to get burned."

SWORDS,38pbaa,MoonSpider,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:10:07 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm a big fan of Albion's Gaddhjalt.  It's big and it's nimble and it's beautiful.  You're really not going to get a pattern-welded blade at that pricepoint. The additional labor hours necessary to do it well are just not happening. Maybe you could get someone to re-hilt a Godfrey blade or one of those discontinued Saxon blades, but neither of those blades have very good shaping or handling characteristics.     If you're really dead-set on a certain hilt and look, I'd say talk to Ernie at Yeshua's sword. He could advise you on building a very nice hilt on an existing, agile blade, his prices are great and his wait-times are reasonable. Maybe he could even set up an etch to put some patterning on the blade if that's your cup of tea."
SWORDS,38pbaa,J_G_E,3,Wed Jun 10 21:14:27 2015 UTC,"MoonSpider's comment is pretty comprehensive, I would just add a small point:  Do you already own swords?  I the answer is No, then do not buy from a custom smith.   Yes, we're all perfectly capable of making whatever you ask for. (well, at least, the competent ones are) But in all honesty... you'll regret it. 2, 3 years down the line, you'll find yourself saying ""I should've asked for a wheel pommel"" or ""I should've asked for a scent stopper pommel"" or ""it would've been better a little longer/shorter/lighter/heavier"". Save your money, buy one or two off-the shelf swords - whether its viking, bronze age, medieval, etc, and use them. If you're interested in how the real things were used, join up to an Iaido/Kendo/HEMA group, and learn a bit. Get to understand what those cheap, affordable swords are like in the hand, and learn what you like the feel of, and you will have a far better understanding of what will suit you, and and that will let you pick a design which will become something you treasure for life. Without that experience, you're essentially shooting blind.    Also, as said, do your research on forums and find who's well-regarded. Some guys excel at different periods - Burridge's bronzes, Barta's pattern-welding, Peter Johnsson's medieval arms with geometric proportion, Cognot's basilards (and  warhammers/maces), and so on, each stand out. Get the right person to do the job you want, and you'll get a far better finish for the price paid, than a craftsman skilled in a different area, doing the same job.  Browse the forums all over the place, read everything you can and take your time over it, and you'll avoid regrets."

SWORDS,38og4a,somekindawizard1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:00:01 2015 UTC,"Hey mate, ordered from the US, through Kult of Athena on the 11th last month, shipped and got to the UK by the 15th, until now it has been awaiting customs checking, I'm expecting a letter soon regarding the duty I will have to pay. That is the only issue I have faced so far, depending on what sword you are purchasing, I imagine there will be as little trouble for you, just remember that importing curved swords over so many centimeters is illegal. I'm fairly sure anything else is ok.  Just ask if you have any more questions :)"
SWORDS,38knf2,DiscontentedFairy,6,Thu Jun 4 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"I will work on getting some decent quality photos of it. But supposedly this is the Civil War sabre of my ancestor, Josiah H Moore of the First Vermont Cavalry, who was actually in Andersonville for 6 months.   I suppose I wanted to ask some of the knowledgeable folks here some questions. First, is this sword consistent with that? Or is family lore incorrect? Second, on one side it appears to say U.S. G.W.C. 1865. On the other side it has some very faint writing, but rusted over and I can no longer read it. What does the one inscription say, and do you know what the other side might have said? It looks like a thin, hand-done engraving perhaps.   What would have entitled a Civil War soldier to a sword? Does this mean something about his rank or duties?  Lastly, is there a way to repair the leather on the handle where it has rotted? Or is it best to leave it as-is?"
SWORDS,38knf2,altrsaber,4,Thu Jun 4 20:59:33 2015 UTC,"Neat! Looks like a Model 1860 Cavalry Sword which was indeed used in the Civil War, the date is a bit late though considering the war ended in May of 1965, so it's hard to say if it saw action or if it was a souvenir. Do you know when he was mustered?  The inscription could have been anything, I don't believe there was a standard, but it's probably his name and rank.  Almost all Civil War Cavalry would have been issued sabers, as they were very effective weapons on horseback, it was mainly for infantry that it was reserved for officers as a symbol of authority since bayonets would have been more effective in battle.  There are ways to repair the leather, various oils, but I would leave that to a professional due to the sentimental value."

SWORDS,38knf2,schoocher,3,Fri Jun 5 02:23:30 2015 UTC,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_1860_Light_Cavalry_Saber  GWC is likely the initials of the inspector who accepted the sabre on behalf of federal forces.  There are likely other inspector's stamps... one on the tip of the scabbard drag and one on the pommel cap.  Can't even remotely see the rusted inscription due to the low resolution photos; it's most likely the company that made the sword. Maybe Ames Mfg. Co/Chicoppee/Mass?  There were other manufacturers as well...  Unless you're planning on wearing it into battle in the foreseeable future, replacing the grip or cleaning it would likely be a big mistake."
SWORDS,38knf2,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:31:20 2015 UTC,"Model 1860 Light Cavalry Saber:       The Model 1860 Light Cavalry Saber (also known as the M1862 as this was when the first 800 were issued)  was used by US cavalry from the American Civil War  until the end of the Indian wars; some were still in use during the Spanish-American War.  It was 41in long with a 35in by 1in blade and weighed 2 lb 4oz alone or 3 lb 10oz with iron scabbard.   During the Civil War there was no light or heavy cavalry in the US army. Instead there were ""Dragoons"" (founded 1830) ""Mounted Riflemen"", (founded c.1840) and ""Cavalry"" (founded 1856), distinguished by the orange, green or yellow piping on their uniforms.  In 1861 these mounted regiments were renamed cavalry and given yellow piping.   The M1860 saber received its name to distinguish it from the larger and heavier Model 1840 Heavy Cavalry Saber that it replaced. Like its predecessor it had a brass guard, leather-wrapped grip and steel scabbard but unlike the M1840 it was smaller and easier to handle.

SWORDS,38ltwq,ThatReallyTallGuy,5,Fri Jun 5 01:32:51 2015 UTC,"it looks like you have a Bedouin dagger, a Indonesian or Malaysian kris and I think a French Model 1842 Yataghan Sword Bayonet  I posted this in /r/whatisthisthing , did it not show up?"
SWORDS,38ltwq,nhjuyt,1 point,Fri Jun 5 05:42:20 2015 UTC,"Ah! I see it now, I've been working off my phone, which is in the middle of crapping itself, and I must have missed your message. It's great to find out what they are, they've puzzled me immensely. Are you able to give me any more information about any of them?"
SWORDS,38ltwq,Jack0fHearts18,2,Fri Jun 5 05:54:50 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  Basically it's a ""Kriss"" blade, the smaller one seems to be a jambiya of sorts.  The other is a bayonet, more likely French.    Hang tight for someone who knows more details."
SWORDS,38ltwq,karlagius,1 point,Fri Jun 5 03:15:09 2015 UTC,"The sword looks Balinese - there's a very similar one here: http://www.trocadero.com/stores/101antiques/items/809901/item809901.html  The bayonet looks like a French Chassepot, so 1869 might make sense."
