There are going to be tons of conflicts with that load order, a Merged Patch should help to resolve some of them and may fix the specific issue you're experiencing."
FalloutMods,3e5ryr,Taffy711,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:52:11 2015 UTC,Really how are there going to be tons of issues? I've been playing fine with this being my only issue. I have about 25 hrs so far.
FalloutMods,3e5ryr,Taffy711,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:11:44 2015 UTC,"Run the load order through FNVEdit if you don't believe me, then apply a filter and every plugin that's red has a conflict. I think nearly every single one will, which is just natural as a part of a long load order with lots of large overhaul mods, but that's why literally every guide to modding any Bethesda game says that a Merged Patch is essential. Just because you're not noticing conflicts doesn't mean they're not there."
FalloutMods,3e5ryr,Taffy711,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:31:59 2015 UTC,"Okay I'll give it a shot tomorrow. Thanks for the help, and I'll let you know if it fixes it."

Was Vulpes still at the Town Hall? I mean, if everything else is triggering, all you're really missing out on is being told about the mission ""Booted"" (you can still complete it), and gaining karma from giving Boxcars some dope for his legs.  But most importantly, you still got to kill that asshole Swanick."
FalloutMods,3e5pul,AJockeysBallsack,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:42:47 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, weirdly enough I went to Nipton from the east side and Swanick didn't spawn (Legion did though) so I reloaded and went in from the west.

There may be a way to reset the town, like restarting the Nipton recon mission.  If you look for his wiki page, your bug may already be known and have a solution posted.  If all else fails, use  console commands and his BaseID to spawn him.  I don't know if you can interact with him that way, but it's no worse than him not being there."

Other than that the first thing that jumps out at me is that you don't have a Merged Patch, so I'd get on that ASAP as a way to resolve a lot of conflicts, although I'm not sure it will help with this specific bug. Then double check that you've got Archive Invalidation working. And you're missing a few compatibility patches, for example WMX-EVE. After these steps if the bug is still there you can start narrowing it down to a specific plugin.  Edit: The Merged Patch should be the last step you do after resolving the other issues."

FalloutMods,3e4iin,vraleigh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"Alright, so can you start the game with no mods if you reinstalled it? Make sure you deleted all the files in the /steamapps folder and everything.  Then install NVSE by following the instructions. Open FOMM, go to package manager and put in PN, then install as it tells you to do.   The other mods you listed shouldn't affect anything as long as you follow the instructions.  Then run LOOT  Another thing to do is install FNVEDIT, it'll tell you if anything is wrong. Make a folder called whatever and put the .exe and the hardcopy from the download in there."

FalloutMods,3e356q,vraleigh,2,Tue Jul 21 19:05:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I discovered that earlier. The issue is way less prominent at daytime, so it's almost definitely due to the lighting. I'd just really love it if I didn't end up making grimaces every time I use the pipboy  at night. Could it be ENB-related? I've tried turning my ENB off while in-game and it doesn't seem to change anything."
FalloutMods,3e356q,KeixuTearraven,2,Tue Jul 21 19:08:57 2015 UTC,"I think it's just the screen and the problem for you is exacerbated since not only do you have a cleaner pip-boy hud (darnui, right?) but you also have a pip-boy texture replacer so the actual screen looks even worse. I know my pip-boy doesn't look great either but I use an ENB and I think it's just naturally not good looking.

It's not a perfect solution, of course, as it's literally hiding the problem rather than fixing it. But I don't think there is a true fix.  Also, IMO the distribution routine could use a little work. I may tinker with the mod a bit myself to see if I can make it so it that it mostly only adds chains to NPCs who need the neck-concealer (a lot of outfits already conceal the seam, and it doesn't make sense that everyone wears some sort of neck accessory) and also to prevent some of the more clashing combos, like people wearing a strand of pearls with their ragged wastelander clothes."

Just copy its files to your fallout directory per the install guide.  New Vegas Stutter Remover:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34832/?  Requires NVSE, but fixes some stuttering issues and improves performance slightly.  Project Nevada  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40040/?  A mod that greatly expands many of the game mechanics and improves the game overall. Its a must have base and a good introduction to modified fallout new vegas.  Mod Configuration Menu (MCM):  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507/?  Used to tweak settings added by many mods including project nevada.  CASM - MCM Version:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/45652/?  Save Manager, allows you to change auto save settings and many other variables, a nice quality of life mod  WMX:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/39651/?  Weapon Mods Expanded - Allows you to add weapon mods (Scopes etc) to unique named weapons as well as expanding the selection of modifications to choose from.  Weapon Mod Menu:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/44515/?  Allows for easy install/uninstall of weapon mods from weapons, as well as lets you see which mods can be installed into each weapon  oHUD:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/44757/?  A mod that lets you customize and move your hud elements, can make the game feel more immersive.  UIO:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/57174/?  UIO auto generates the menu files required for oHUD and some other mods.  Bison Steve Hotel and Lucky Casino:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40433/?

The whole series is good, but Bounties I is a classic quest mod at this point.  More Perks:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/35979/?  More Perks to choose from  Chems Alcohol and Meds:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/50817/?  This mod does include lots of visuals and may effect performance, but it adds and names many of the chemicals you will find in game. Smoke Cigarettes, Drink named Alcohols and use more drugs.  The list is mostly setup in the order you should install things.    Mission Mojave - Community Bug Fix patch  OR  YUP - Yukichigai Unofficial Patch - Similar to the above, but stripped down version.   Using both can cause problems in some cases (some people are fine, others have crashes/broken games)  NVAC - New Vegas Anti Crash, A mod seperate from the above that adds some stability through structured exception handling; invaluable when adding lots of mods.    In addition, if your PC can handle increased textures:  NMC Texture Pack - Better textures that update the game, the small or medium packs are pretty good, the large is if your PC has killer perfomance.   Poco Bueno Texture pack - Similar to above, but a different take on it. installing both is Poco/NMC is fine, just that some files will be overwritten.   FCO - Fallout Character Overhaul - Better NPCs  NVR - New Vegas Redesigned.  NPCs updated similar to/ in conjunction with FCO   Spice of life - More NPC clothes and armor variety. Requires a few things  Diversified Wasteland - Same as above, works well when used in conjunction  Electro City - Part of a lighting overhaul, adds street lights and better signs around the strip/key locations.   WRP - Weapon Retexture Project - Better looking core weapons; works well if you do a total graphics overhaul.   Nevada Skies - Better random weather effects, makes the wasteland feel a bit unpredictable. Rain/Thunder/Sand Storm/Radiation storms.     AWOP - A World Of Pain, Massive mod that adds lots of locations and a few quests, gives you hours of stuff to explore and stumble upon.   Primm/Novac/Goodsprings Reborn - Slightly reworks the key towns in New Vegas  NVInteriors Project - Interiors added or expanded in many buildings.   Weapons of the New millenia - Modern Weapons, Hi resolution models. More weapons to use and find.     If you do go about installing most of the list, be aware that you need to do a bit of reading and patching to get everything working together.   Thats most of my current new vegas build, at least the notable things."
FalloutMods,3e0btq,ect0s,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:10:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the recommendations!  I'm pretty sure I botched something in the setup with body textures looking slightly weird and some random crashes, but I'll get it sorted out.  Do you have any general advice on what kinds of mods are more crash prone when not installed right and what kind I shouldn't worry much about?  Regardless, I'm already seeing promising improvements to the game."
FalloutMods,3e0btq,ect0s,2,Tue Jul 21 07:22:30 2015 UTC,"Do you have any general advice on what kinds of mods are more crash prone when not installed right   Well, it varies greatly from mod to mod.  Things that change the HUD/UI can crash the game on startup if they aren't configured correctly. UIO generally fixes this.   Things that interfere with the same location can also cause crashes when entering or leaving that location; this includes changing or creating conflicts with the NPC's in the area.   Generally, texture mods won't cause crashes, but they might create obvious glitches.   Things that change weapons can cause crashes once the weapon is used or picked up; My latest play through I found one of the unique weapons would crash my game if I tried to equip it, but otherwise was fine in my inventory.   Script errors are one of the big ones, NVAC (New Vegas Anti Crash) can resolve some of these issues; In general exceptions (logic errors etc) cause New Vegas to panic and crash, but NVAC looks at the type of error and tries to resolve it on the fly.  A few tools you might want to try:  LOOT  https://loot.github.io/  Load Order Optimization Tool - Tries to resolve your load order so that dependancies and conflicts are resolved. In general, backup your load order (export it to a file). Then load loot, hit sort, save, close loot and reload new vegas.   FNVedit:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34703/?  A tool to look a conflicts between different files. This can help you resolve certain glitches, as well as see which files are winning each conflict.   The big thing you can do here is to create a merged patch, which merges things like weapon lists and armor lists such that all options exist in a final list the game will use.   Heres a tutorial video that explains it fairly well, but it is a bit on the long side. The series of videos its in can help you with learning about install order etc.  https://youtu.be/qVKe51dRm2M?t=183  Theres also:  4 Gigabyte Fallout New Vegas, which increases the memory availible to fallout new vegas when loading things.   http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/55061/?  This is because new vegas was built before 64 bit OS's and large address space were common. This means that fallout can only load ~2gigs of 'stuff' (textures/models/etc) into memory at a time. The 4gig version sets a few flags in the New Vegas.exe to allow it up to 4 gigs of memory for these things.   You can also manually set these flags with a program like cffexplorer, but the file linked above is better."

FalloutMods,3e0btq,ulfjack,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:11 2015 UTC,"A lot of the major ones have already been suggested, so I'll say these. As an alternative to Nevada Skies which I personally loathe (but to each their own, you may like it, test and see), there's:  Fellout - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34888/?  This removes the orange tint, it's basically a vanilla-plus feel if you don't want to change the feel of the game but want it to look nicer. Coupled with Dynavision tweaks, it's pretty damn nice. Very dark nights, bring a flashlight or nightvision. This is the setup I prefer myself.  Realistic Wasteland Lighting - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/52037/?  This is what a lot of YouTubers use. It completely changes the feel of the wasteland, making it feel less apocalyptic and more natural. Blue blue skies, darker nights (but still fairly playable). I don't like it personally, it washes things out a tad.  Realistic Wasteland Lighting Enhancement - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/59591/?  This is an optimized version of the above, plus some minor weather additions, like ocassional rain, overcast, snow on Mount Charleston, mist in Zion, etc. This is good if, like me, you'd prefer a simpler, more realistic version of Nevada Skies. It looks the same as it's counterpart, but fixes the washout. I still don't use it often because the nights are too bright for me, and it's got some pretty intense sky rings at night that I can't get rid of. Otherwise, pretty good.  I'd also throw in Light Up and Smoke Those Cigarettes - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/49677/?  This is actually incredibly well made and just had a massive overhaul. You can smoke the cigarettes you find - they give you stat boosts, but you can get addicted. You can also roll your own at the campfire with Coyote Tobacco Chew, and un-roll them to get the tobacco inside. You can also smoke, roll and un-roll cigars and cigarillos. Very cool mod."

FalloutMods,3e083e,wareagle3000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:43:04 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you're asking here. You want to manually install everything and forego MO entirely? Then just use NMM or FOMM or the like. They throw everything in the game folder the same way, just easier. But I don't like doing that, because I want to keep my stuff separate. I change what mods I used a lot - sometimes a mod will look cool, only for me to find out later that incompatibilities break my game. Which means I'd get rid of it, or one of the mods, without resorting to trying to pick out bits and pieces in the install directory or reinstalling altogether.  If you're dead set on actual manual installation, then most of the stuff you installed via MO is in the Mods folder in the MO directory. Open each mod and drag/drop or copy/paste into the respective folder. Be careful to put data folder contents in the data folder and stuff that goes outside data outside it. Honestly, it's really not worth the headache to do that, go with NMM/FOMM or pray someone comes up with a working solution to this whole issue with MO."

Generally, if your installing a patch its fine, if your installing a graphics overhaul (Eve ETC) usually it won't matter which version you keep, except one might be higher quality.   When over-writing models and the related textures you can run into some conflicts, but generally things will still run (just look a bit broken in game, wrong texture for new model etc).   EDIT: Its a good idea to load the game every few mods (or every mod if your paranoid) and do a few things like walk to a new location, visit an NPC, shoot some guns etc. Sometimes things will seam fine till you try to walk into a building or walk into a new cell in the game."

FalloutMods,3dyj87,vraleigh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:16:31 2015 UTC,If I may ask what is the difference between FOMM and NMM? I mean besides the fact that FOMM is specifically for Fallout games.
FalloutMods,3dyj87,onehitimpact,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:04 2015 UTC,NMM connects to your nexusmods account to make downloading and installing mods easier.
FalloutMods,3dyj87,vraleigh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:31:33 2015 UTC,"Well, FOMM is more ""simpler"" in the sense. You download the mod yourself, then tell FOMM where it is and it puts it where it's told. NMM does a lot more like searching for updates, downloading directly plus it does it for all the nexus mods but because of that I feel it's a lot harder to know what's really going on when you install mods. So FOMM is a lot easier to really know what your doing. Generally for most mods NMM works pretty fine but I personally feel FOMM is a lot easier to use if you're willing to invest the time and look through the mod file yourself, see if you need to do it manually or not.   For example, I installed Breezes recently so with FOMM all I did was open FOMM, tell FOMM where the mod was (/downloads) and then it opened it up and the .fomod just gave me a list of choices to pick from and then it was installed. Then you just install the armor packs the same way and bam, that's it. Same thing with Type 3 for females. Then you just use Archive Invalidation already built into FOMM and you're done. I haven't done it with NMM so I can't compare but that's an example of how FOMM works."

Your guides have been a godsend so far.  How many videos do you plan on making?  I was sad to discover that you only have 4 videos so far and it looks like you are only doing one video a week :(

I also have to balance out the FO3 series with ""MO for FNV"" to keep it going. The good news is that there will be more vids coming in shorter installments that don't take as much time in the testing phase. UI mods had to be in one big installment, and even then I feel like I shortchanged it due to time constraints.   I'm glad the series is helping you. Cheers  -Cal"

FalloutMods,3dwsqi,ect0s,2,Mon Jul 20 05:40:55 2015 UTC,"Nevada Skies should usually be last or very close to last.   oHUD REQUIRES UIO, I don't see UIO in your load order. Since menu systems are loaded early, this could cause a CTD on startup  Darnified UI used to require you update your fallout ini files for the fonts to work, and if this isn't setup you would crash on start up (since the fonts are used at the main menu).   Those are the immediate issues I see, There might be some patches for WMX/Eve/Project Nevada that your missing."

I must have been unlucky the last time I installed it incorrectly, I had some crashes, then reinstalled darnifiedUI and a few other menu mods and my issue corrected itself.   Perhaps its the order in which you've installed things?   I usually install MCM/oHUD/UIO after most other mods.    I had Unified Hud Project running   Unified Hud and is incorporated into oHud I think, perhaps its because you tried migrating from one to the next?"
FalloutMods,3dwr0u,one_salty_cracka,2,Mon Jul 20 04:20:40 2015 UTC,"Looks good to me, all I could suggest is to use CASM with MCM (different version uploaded on nexus).  TTW for me was just as stable as FNV was. It's a bit more difficult to get some mods working properly (anything that re-adds FO3 weapons to NV needs a compatibility patch), but definitely worth it overall."
FalloutMods,3dwr0u,NukaCooler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:07:03 2015 UTC,"I was going to get that version of CASM, but it said that Lutana NVSE plugin was required and I didn't know what that was. Is there a difference between the regular CASM and the MCM version like stability or is it just being able to tweak the settings? Thanks for answering btw."
FalloutMods,3dwr0u,NukaCooler,2,Mon Jul 20 05:34:21 2015 UTC,"There's a couple of useful extra settings like: number of autosaves, type of save on travel/level up/discover location/enter location.  It's also a lot easier to configure.  The Lutana NVSE plugin is just an NVSE plugin that adds a number of new functions to NVSE. It doesn't affect performance on its own, so I'd recommend getting it."
FalloutMods,3dwr0u,NukaCooler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:44:14 2015 UTC,"Ok, would it be ok to uninstall CASM and get CASM with MCM mid save? It isn't a big issue because I just started, but I was wondering."
FalloutMods,3dwr0u,Stifling_Bossness,2,Mon Jul 20 05:48:57 2015 UTC,"It should be okay, you'll just have the old CASM saves still there.  Oh, and that's another major advantage of CASM with MCM - it doesn't use a maximum of 3 ""profiles"" to keep your saves in (leading to the danger of overwriting saves if you start a new character). CASM with MCM keeps a stockpile of saves per character, so unless you deliberately start a new character with the same name your saves are safe.  The saves are also named much better. From memory they are Character name - Save number - Date in ISO8601 - playtime in HH:MM:SS"
FalloutMods,3dwr0u,NukaCooler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:55:24 2015 UTC,"That is actually much more helpful because I planned on having a Fallout 3 save and a New Vegas save, so I can more easily differentiate the two saves. Thanks for the help."

The only problem is that the stat value won't be properly displayed in the level-up menu or (I think) the Pip-Boy. If your skill level is greater than or equal to 100, it'll still read as 100.

So if you even manage to spend 5000 AP in some magical manner, you will have it back in no time.  Here is the link to the file.

FalloutMods,3dtiyn,Your401Kplan,3,Sun Jul 19 09:45:31 2015 UTC,"From urban dictionary:  ""Modding, in the videogame world, is adding, altering, or purging content on a videogame, especially on the pc. Mods can be quests, items, houses for the player, towns, shops, factions, or altering technical stuff(scripts, textures, meshes). There are also total conversion mods, which are mods to an insane degree.""  Save editing is just cheating in new items, you aren't adding on to the game or creating new content."

FalloutMods,3dt3fb,Ufcrit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:48:20 2015 UTC,When previously installing the mod you just uninstalled it must have overwritten previous mods and is stalling the game. Uninstall the mods you think it all had modified. Or what you had uninstalled played a huge role in your most recent save and the game is getting confused

Problem is, other mods that add or change eyes also replace the meshes. Depending on your install order (NOT load order) you then end up with FCO eye textures on vanilla meshes, or other mods eye textures on FCO meshes.  Either see if you can find a compatibility patch between FCO and whatever other eye changing mods you have, or choose between them.  Oh and make sure ArchiveInvalidation is working."

I would try opening the PN equipment module in GECK or FNVEDIT and looking around at the power armor helmets and ranger helmet items to see if they have any special object effects or scripts attached to them. They also could be part of a formlist but I'm not sure so I'll have to check myself"
FalloutMods,3drdnx,rusticredneck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:32:35 2015 UTC,"Well, I figured out how to resolve it for one helm.  I opened a similar patch for another armor set with FNVedit, found the form lists.  Then searched for the formlists in geck, and added the relevant armor helm via drag and drop to it.  I had to changed some settings on the armor.esp so it would load Project Nevada Core and Project Nevada Equipments as masters."

FalloutMods,3dsg37,ect0s,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:33:29 2015 UTC,"Well, its going to vary greatly from mod to mod.  Some mods are better optomized, and others not so much.  Anything with graphical changes might end up more taxing, since most mods that add new content tend to add higher resolution models and textures (which in turn are more resource intense).   There are a number of mods that focus more on the game itself, and you could start with those. Heres a good version of the basic set of mods I use on all my play throughs (missing all the graphics overhauls I normally use):    NVSE:   http://nvse.silverlock.org/  New Vegas Script Extender, a required utility for many mods. Just copy its files to your fallout directory per the install guide.    New Vegas Stutter Remover:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34832/?  Requires NVSE, but fixes some stuttering issues and improves performance slightly.   Project Nevada  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40040/?  A mod that greatly expands many of the game mechanics and improves the game overall. Its a must have base and a good introduction to modified fallout new vegas.   Mod Configuration Menu (MCM):  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507/?  Used to tweak settings added by many mods including project nevada.   CASM - MCM Version:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/45652/?  Save Manager, allows you to change auto save settings and many other variables, a nice quality of life mod  WMX:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/39651/?  Weapon Mods Expanded - Allows you to add weapon mods (Scopes etc) to unique named weapons as well as expanding the selection of modifications to choose from.   Weapon Mod Menu:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/44515/?  Allows for easy install/uninstall of weapon mods from weapons, as well as lets you see which mods can be installed into each weapon  oHUD:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/44757/?  A mod that lets you customize and move your hud elements, can make the game feel more immersive.   UIO:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/57174/?  UIO auto generates the menu files required for oHUD and some other mods.   Bison Steve Hotel and Lucky Casino:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/40433/?  A great quest that gives you a nice player home in the end.  Someguy Series: New Vegas Bounties etc:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37310/?  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/48925/?  The whole series is good, but Bounties I is a classic quest mod at this point.  More Perks:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/35979/?  More Perks to choose from  Chems Alcohol and Meds:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/50817/?  This mod does include lots of visuals and may effect performance, but it adds and names many of the chemicals you will find in game. Smoke Cigarettes, Drink named Alcohols and use more drugs.     The list is mostly setup in the order you should install things."

Edit: This one has been reported by some to be incompatible with the Steam GOTY version, and they claim it will cause problems. Judge for yourself  Performance of the Gods FNV - Disables tons of things, far more than Clean Deluxe. This might conflict with Clean Deluxe. I'd say use one or the other, this one being more extreme.    Better Game Performace FNV - No reason for anyone to not use this unless they have TTW.  Ultimate Performance F3 - Incorporates the Fallout 3 version of Better Game performance along with some other mods. Disables quite a lot of things, both noticeable and un-noticeable.  Better Performance for older PCs FNV - Removes hit refraction and gunshot light effects. Basically better performance in combat.  No hit refraction F3 - Removes screen blur when hit by bullets.   No gunshot lights F3 - No lights emitted when guns are fired. Helps a surprising amount when in heavy combat.  Better Combat Performance FNV - The first esp here will remove all bullet casings, or rather prevent any more than zero from appearing.   There's probably more stuff, but those mods are good. It depends on how much performance you need. If you only need a little, just use Clean Deluxe and the gunshot lights ones. If you need a lot of extra performance, Performance of the Gods will provide. Be warned that it takes a lot of scenery out of the game."

As long as you have stutter remover, Invisible wall remover, and all the memory enhancement processes (4gb, NVSE memory hack, and ENBoost) it should run just fine. My only problem with it is that the cars felt way too floaty and the physics were just not realistic at all. Handling isn't too bad, you get used to it at least, but it never really feels like you're driving a car.   Another mod you might consider is the mobile truck base. You can't physically drive it, but it works similar to carriages in Skyrim to get you to certain locations. Also doubles as a nice player home."

Not really, LOOT would just organize things in the way it thinks is most likely to work, however sometimes its ordering isn't correct.   FO3edit can show you which files are set as masters, and perhaps creating a merged patch and walking through its changes might give you an idea where things are failing. It looks like you did try making a merged patch already.  Did you have a working load order previously? Perhaps you can revert to that and step through your new mods  slowely till you find the relevant conflicts.

Also, is the weapon you're using modded into the game? If so, is it FWE compatible?  FWE mods the vanilla weapons in the game to do more damage, but modded weapons from Nexus that aren't made compatible with FWE will then be underpowered by comparison.  So, if that were the case, that might explain why your weapons are being ineffective against them. Look at your FWE control panel and look over the various Combat/Global options to make sure it's set to FWE defaults."

FalloutMods,3dj5aa,RTukka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:42:36 2015 UTC,"I understand. The ammo problem can be remedied if you go into the FWE control panel, there are settings for adjusting the scarcity of ammo, drugs, etc...  Set them to vanilla and that should at least balance out the yao guai situation.  Also, consider MMM if you're not using it; on top of its increased spawn feature it also has a decrease spawn feature, so it should cut down on the crazy spawns that you're encountering as well as make them more diverse (since it adds new creatures to the spawn list). Like FWE it's very customizable."

FalloutMods,3dgw01,AggressionRanger,3,Fri Jul 17 07:22:43 2015 UTC,As it is I already have each mesh separated into their individual parts so this won't be an issue. Everyone is acting like there is going to be some extreme overhaul in the way they handle importing meshes. Personally I don't forsee that happening. My only hope is that we can ditch Nifskope and actually have a proper importing/conversion system built into the GECK itself but that's just wishful thinking.

FalloutMods,3djfbn,SteveDallas,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:26:39 2015 UTC,I too have issues with the wrapper version. Here's what I did:  Install the injector version. Edit enbinjector.ini and add your fallout executable under [TRAGETPROCESS]. Start the injector first then fallout.
FalloutMods,3dj6gt,Vendetta6161,2,Thu Jul 16 18:22:38 2015 UTC,"ENB cannot crash your game. Verify the game cache via steam. Try to load a pure vanilla game. If it works, add the ENB. Make sure the files are placed in the fallout nv root folder, where the .exe is. Make the appropriate ini changes, I.e. Make sure to properly set up the enboost parameters according to your system. Keep us updated."
FalloutMods,3dj6gt,Mariasgringo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:04:12 2015 UTC,the problem was that the d3d9.dll that all the enb's told me to use was incompatible with the newer versions of directx on my pc. Another user told me how to use the injector version (no pesky d3d9.dll) as a workaround

FalloutMods,3dhsci,lpbarrows,2,Thu Jul 16 12:23:25 2015 UTC,Working on installing those for the moment.  Spice of life takes a bit of work with the body replacers etc.  Any tips for load order?

FalloutMods,3dgnmh,AggressionRanger,2,Thu Jul 16 03:05:14 2015 UTC,I could try it out. Would you need an absolute clean slate or should it be tried with other mods?
FalloutMods,3dgnmh,thecleanestfish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:48:48 2015 UTC,"I would prefer not necessarily a clean slate (as in new game), but at least a character or save-game that is vanilla as possible.

I'll PM you here in a bit for more details."

After following everything to the letter, my game loads fine. No ssd, and my system is definitely weaker than yours, gtx 660 ti, amd fx4300. I don't seem to have any lengthy load times. The only issue I have is between enboost and the 4gb loader. I get weird transparency issues. Which means I've not properly set up the 4gb loader. As far as your specific issue I can only suggest a reinstall. Verify the game cache, reset your ini's to default and start over. I don't know anything about windows8, could that be an issue?"
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,Bd0g360,3,Thu Jul 16 00:10:56 2015 UTC,"Look on the TTW forums for mods and compatibility. Most New Vegas mods should work fine. All the big ones WMX, MMM, EVE, Redesigned, and tons more have install instructions for TTW on the TTW forums.  I highly recommend using Mod Organizer over NMM. MO keeps your game folder clean by putting the mods in separate folders. Especially with TTW if something breaks, you can easily uninstall it without breaking your game further. Watch some tutorials on YouTube on how to fully utilize MO properly."
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,TicklishRocket,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:41:49 2015 UTC,"I really want to use MO, but recently I tried to get NV installed correctly with it twice, and it failed both times because of MO. First, it somehow lost all of the mods I had downloaded and installed when I relaunched it, then it refused to work with NVSE, FN4GB, and an ENB. You can look through my post history to find the latter. I've used NMM my entire 900 hours between FO3, Skyrim, and FNV, so I think I'm just gonna stick with what I know, even if MO is a lot better."
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,TicklishRocket,2,Thu Jul 16 01:00:15 2015 UTC,Just recommending it since TTW has a habit of breaking when mods are not installed as recommended. Going to save you a ton of headache
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,IAMPOUNDCAKE,2,Thu Jul 16 01:06:04 2015 UTC,"Use this as a very loose guide for setting up MO/TTW. There is also this that is based on it, but it isn't anywhere near as thorough/complete. TTW modding is notoriously messy in comparison to FO3/NV on their own, for several reasons. Its still very possible to do though if you read those walls of text. :)"
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,verybadai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:54:15 2015 UTC,"I use MO with an ENB and the 4GB Launcher (that also uses NVSE), it all works just fine.  I personally just install the TTW core files manually, just dumping them in the Data folder, whereas all the other mods are being controlled by MO.  A lot of the TTW mods are patches that require you to install the original Fallout 3 version then replacing the esm/esp with the TTW converted file, so NMM might have issues with that, unless you do that manually.  In the long run, MO will save you a ton of time, it just takes some learning to use it."
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,Stifling_Bossness,2,Thu Jul 16 01:47:26 2015 UTC,"The TTW site has some mods made specifically for TTW, and a lot that were converted to work in it. http://taleoftwowastelands.com/forums/tale-two-wastelands-mod-releases  https://taleoftwowastelands.com/forums/tale-two-wastelands-converted-mods I'm not sure about mod managers, I almost never use them. You install games to FNV, not FO3 when using TTW"
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,Admiral_Minell,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:25:32 2015 UTC,"I personally recommend FOMM for TTW.  The basic principle is that the guts of Fallout 3 get reorganized into a DLC for FNV. Therefore, any mods you install only really need to be compatible with FNV.   The key to converting mods specifically for TTW (such as NMC's texture packs for both games) is that you start with the older FO3 version, dump in the FNV version, overwrite all the duplicates (so the newer version stays), then pack it up into a mod."
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,morlund69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:18:08 2015 UTC,I have no experience using MO (it's too complicated for me pleb sensibilities) but I know from my own experiences with TTW that NMM has memory issues installing TTW. You should use FOMM or figure out MO.
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,svperstarr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:51:24 2015 UTC,Funny in the last month I played NV/F3 for the first time and I found MO straight forward and FOMM confusing with its sub menus
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,morlund69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:40:15 2015 UTC,"By ""memory issues"" do you mean RAM usage while playing, or corrupt or otherwise problematic data?"
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,PetroarZed,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:48:30 2015 UTC,"In my experience at least, Nexus Mod Manager isn't able to install the .fomod packages created by the Tale of Two Wastelands Installer because the files are so large that NMM runs out of memory installing them, fails, and corrupts the packages, forcing you to delete the fomods and run the installer again. FOMM, for whatever reason, doesn't run into this problem. I prefer NMM over FOMM but I just couldn't get NMM to work for this.   So what I did was use FOMM to install the main TTW fomods and then switched back to NMM for all of my other mods.  Once the packages are installed, it really doesn't matter what load order rearranger you use. Your choice, whatever you are most comfortable with."
FalloutMods,3dg2vr,imacrazysloth,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:34:46 2015 UTC,"NMM is fine, unless it isn't.  That is to say, there's nothing inherently wrong with using it for TTW, but it's still not the best implemented piece of software and has basically no error handling or recovery, and will sometimes just arbitrarily crash when trying to install mods.  That said, I use it for a TTW install with over 100 mods, and it works."
FalloutMods,3dgxyn,Question2005,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:41:01 2015 UTC,I don't have a specific answer. Perhaps it has to do with the shader being used? Compare some meshes that do work with the problematic one in Nifskope. See what differences you can spot and try to apply them to the problematic mesh.
FalloutMods,3dgxyn,DrVolzak,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:11:37 2015 UTC,"Yea ive done that, but i cant figure out whats causing it exactly.  I set the armor to use the exact same shaders as the one that doesnt have blood decals show up and it doesnt work. Number of vertices, etc are obviously different, but that shouldnt affect the decals.  The one thing i did notice is that the bloodless armor has no tangents and bitangents, but there is no option in nifskope that i can find that will let me remove those."
FalloutMods,3dglr6,BabyLettuce,3,Thu Jul 16 02:48:40 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by ""fruitiest""? Are you looking for something minimalistic, cinematic, ""light/performance"" version, or realistic?  Also, it would help if you said which game. I assume it's New Vegas since the FO3 version is not nearly as popular.   ENB presets are a matter of taste, so something I like may not be for you. There's a whole section on the Nexus for ENB presets. I think the best way to find something to like is to just have it sorted by most popular and try them all out until you find one that you like. They are really easy to switch between."
FalloutMods,3dglr6,DrVolzak,2,Thu Jul 16 12:34:21 2015 UTC,Whats the best ultra quality ENB and performance ENB but still good lookin.
FalloutMods,3dglr6,Omega_Chris,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:14:53 2015 UTC,"All and none.  When you learn what settings to tweak you can drastically improve performance even on a heavy hitting ENB. Many decent ENB authors include performance variants in the download folder, which most of the time means deactivating ambient occlusion.  I could tell you what i personally like as an ENB preset and most probably you wouldnt like it. Also i heavily twekaed that setup with time and experience gained on it.  On the other side i could name you an ENB preset which many youtubers and screenshot authors like a lot and i detest whit passion.  Opinions you know. Just try to install one."

You can open the editor in-game by pressing Shift+Enter, but you may also need to edit the file directly for some settings. Once you've decided you have a handle on what all of those do, you can start playing around with the .fx files and modifying shaders. Here's a decent enough guide for Skyrim, but most of it will apply for Fallout as well."

Have you found any Hydra? It's not easy to make (requiring rare-ish Cave Fungus and Surv 75), but it's fairly common from medical merchants, relatively cheap and weightless. And while 1 dose might not fix a limb to full health, it will get every limb to functional again. Plus if they crippled again while it's still in effect, they're automatically restored to working. I only ask because I've had friends play the entire game and never notice it before trying hardcore mode."

And did you enable a bunch of these mods all at once or did you start crashing on startup recently with what you thought was a stable loadout?  I know its common sense, but you could start disabling plugins till you make it to the menu, then start renabling things one at a time.   Once you find a plugin that seams to be causing you crash you could check it against your load order with FNV edit.

FalloutMods,3deceg,MrSpanx,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:04:38 2015 UTC,If you only run 30 fps with an i5 then there is something wrong elsewhere.  Installing any kind of ENB will have impacts of even 45 fps depending on the quantity and complexity of the data on screen to render.  Try with an ENB that offers performance settings and if not switch all settings from high to low. You could deactivate a heavy hitter like ambient occlusion but it defiles the purpose of installing an ENB for visual enhancemnet purpose.
FalloutMods,3deceg,Codysnow31,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:04:41 2015 UTC,I would consider trying out Realism ENB or Old World ENB. Both of those not very demanding.

Without looking, the GT630 is not a terribly powerful GPU, so it might go well but might drop more frames than you seem to think, speed of RAM aside. I have a 650 and didn't lose too many when using very basic settings on an ENB for Skyrim, but I don't know how well it will work on a lower chipset.

FalloutMods,3dfo4t,mbeasy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:49:49 2015 UTC,"Oh yes. In fact, the reason I reinstalled everything was because I installed Windows 7 again, so everything was as clean as a whistle. I completely uninstalled the game multiple times. Tried downloading each file multiple times. Manipulated the ini files. 4gb, nvse, auto purge, anti crash, stutter remover with modified critical sections as the mod author suggested. I did not come here to receive help on my load order or anything like that. I simply want to see if there is something wrong with the nexus site."

Do you have quick saves all turned off, those usually mess everything up and I do not recommend it.  I know TTW has an extra options where you can change the super mutants so they are more like fo3, maybe that'll fix what you are saying. However, I am playing and I also notice a lot of ""kamikaze"" super mutants. Maybe, that's in the base game?"

FalloutMods,3deit6,vraleigh,3,Wed Jul 15 18:24:52 2015 UTC,"Possibly, if you have mods get CASM. It will use hardsaves automatically and you can adjust when it saves, how many, what time, etc. The autosave feature in 3/new vegas is horrible and with mods it creates a big hassle that isn't worth risking. Also, get things like NVAC, 4gb enabler to smooth the game just a bit more so even if you're not using 150 mods it'll still be good to have.  I don't know enough to figure out how to restore it, but hopefully this helps you with your future playing."

FalloutMods,3dedn6,verybadai,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:11:09 2015 UTC,"By renaming them do you mean just change Fallout.ini to something like RenamedFallout.ini, and then to backup just copy the files into a different folder?

FalloutMods,3dedn6,verybadai,2,Thu Jul 16 00:54:51 2015 UTC,"By rename/backup I mean to move the original files somewhere else, or name them to something other than Fallout.ini and FalloutPrefs.ini   Deleting the ini files is also an option...  So once you rename both files (or deleted them), simple open the New Vegas Launcher and it should automatically reconfigure new ini files again.  Make sure to turn of Anti Aliasing, Anisotropic filter, HDR On, etc.    Now I personally always use the latest version of the d3d9.dll for ENBs, even if the particular present says to use an older version.  You should also make sure your Graphics card drivers are up to date...   Hope this clears some things up."

After that make sure your load order is correct and that you reset archive invalidation again. Also, be sure that you install FCO first, and then nv Redesigned 3 and make sure when it asks if you want to rewrite the files, click yes to all.

The limit isn't fixed but is usually in the neighborhood of 120-140 mods.  The game won't crash but you get weird behaviour which isn't consistent, they can include the errors in your screenshot though.  To fix it cut down on the mods or merge them together.  I've also seen Enbboost cause something kind of similar if compression wasn't turned on. Not enbboosts fault, just not enough memory for the game."

FalloutMods,3dcrg6,rocktheprovince,5,Wed Jul 15 06:40:47 2015 UTC,"First three things you should try:  Toggle archive invalidation off, and then back on again. You can do this in the tools menu of NMM or MO.  If that doesn't work, try validating your game cache. Go to your Steam library, find New Vegas, right click properties, and validate.   If that doesn't do the trick, your problem is too many mods. Cut it below the 135 plugin limit including inactive plugins. If the first two steps solve the problem, it's possible that you'll have this issue again in the future unless you use less mods."

Move darnified UI to be #1 in your left pane, then position any other ui mods (like MCM menu) directly after it. If I recall there's a specific install order with ui mods to make it work right just as it would if you were doing it manually. Also make sure to get the DARN ui hotfix from the main forum page. I'm at work now but when I get home I can post a screen of my mod order/load order for reference and more info. Also your load order looks fine to me so that shouldn't be the problem.   NINJA EDIT: After another quick look over of your mod list I saw your other ui mods, I have the same ones and there's definitely a certain priority order to make them work right together.

Aside from that I guess just make sure you have all the appropriate patches for using mods together and with TTW but I'm sure you've gotten that taken care of. When exactly does your game freeze? When loading the main menu? Because if that's it then the problem is probably with darnui, but if it's during the loading screen then it could be something else"

FalloutMods,3de3r9,rusticredneck,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:04:48 2015 UTC,"No problem! The reason that was happening is because priority in MO means which files from which mods get to overwrite others. Since NMC was higher than TTW, the NMC menu was overwriting TTWs, but now that you reversed it its the other way around. That's one of the reasons I love Mod organizer. Let me know if you have any other questions!"
FalloutMods,3ddbpg,PerfectHair,2,Wed Jul 15 11:18:10 2015 UTC,I don't think WRP is that great.

WRP is ehhh alright.   However if anybody does know of a solution I'd like to try it.
FalloutMods,3ddbpg,vraleigh,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:45:05 2015 UTC,Yeah some of the textures are messed up. I usually download the 357 retex and the single shotgun retex for some quick fixes. Haven't really noticed other blunders from wrp though.

Will try disabling TTWoptions.esp like /u/CloneTwo7 said.  While I'm at it, I'm using ENB and I get the d3d9 bug 9 launches out of 10, but if I use the workaround and put d3d9 in the exes folder the game launches without ENB, anyone know what's up with that? Game is unplayable without ENB thanks to appcrashes.  EDIT: Oh lawdy, it worked perfectly, and from what I've read, the options remain in the game because the .esp only provides an MCM menu. Pretty happy tbh :)"
FalloutMods,3dbeuy,alluringthickness,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:34:18 2015 UTC,I had the same problem. I heard there's a patch somewhere for it. But if you just disable the TTWoptions.esp that will do the trick.
FalloutMods,3dbeuy,CloneTwo7,3,Tue Jul 14 23:56:10 2015 UTC,"I think they updated very recently to include the long load time patch, so it may not be linked on the FAQ anymore.  One thing to keep in mind is that eventually you'll probably end up with slow load times anyway(30 seconds+), just due to how large the save file gets with data from both wastelands and all the DLCs baked in.  5 minutes though sounds like the bugged TTWoptions."

The pimp boy is the same mesh as the regular pip boy but uses a different texture set in the GECK. you're going to want to open the geck and find the pimp boy texture set under the texture set section in the geck. Make a note of the folder paths of each texture. Then, rename the tin textures (all of them) to match their corresponding pimp boy originals, and install them into the exact same folder path in your data folder (which you'll probably have to make yourself).   If the pimp boy uses its own mesh it'll be a little more complicated but I'll have to check to me sure, I'm on mobile at work atm."

I can't find a mod by either name. Did you miss part of the name?   Uninstalling a mod doesn't always mean that all files are removed. For me, uninstalling the FCO mod always leaves the updated face textures in place, for example. If you go to the mod page and download the actual mod (as a .zip) manually, you can look inside to see what files the mod includes and then manually delete them from the /data folder in your Fallout: New Vegas/Fallout 3 installation folder."

FalloutMods,3d8a4y,Ghostpastries,2,Tue Jul 14 07:49:58 2015 UTC,"TL;DR version: yes, definitely.  Aside from simple bugs or conflicts with the mods you install, there's a few things I can think of. The more serious one is NV's strange plugin limit. Other Bethesda games can have up to 256 plugins active -- the max size of the 1-byte ID each plugin gets. But NV for some reason internally starts numbering FalloutNV.esm much higher than 00, and once you have around 140 plugins, the IDs assigned to their data simply loop back around and start replacing data from FalloutNV.esm and other plugins, without any kind of error message or instant crash. Or... something like that, I really don't understand it. But you'll know if you have this problem or not -- just check if you have more than 135ish plugins.  The other (more likely) possibility is autosave corruption. It's been known for many years that autosaves and quicksaves in this game engine slowly corrupt the save data. Mods like CASM exist partly to replace the autosave and quicksave. I forget where I read this, maybe in the menu or documentation for CASM, but apparently it has to do with the game engine's normal autosaves not deleting the existing autosave data before overwriting it. Anyone know more about this?"
FalloutMods,3d8a4y,sheepandshepherd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:23:43 2015 UTC,"I basically know as much as you do, but I'm certain it has to do with the save files. I know that CASM only helps so much; I had a perfectly modded game with zero incompatibilities and only about 52 plugins, after a month it was unplayable. I was using CASM in conjunction with everything else. Things just start... breaking.  Ghostpastries: It's relatively inevitable as far as I'm aware. It's the reason I haven't finished a playthrough since I owned it on the 360 in 2010. I like taking my time to play a game - modded New Vegas isn't so lenient about that."
FalloutMods,3d8a4y,ulfjack,2,Tue Jul 14 10:39:34 2015 UTC,"Autosave corruption shouldn't be an issue if you don't load the game for a month or so, as the OP says. There's nothing about an untouched save that should magically degrade if you wait a week, a month, or a year before picking it up again.  Beyond that, I've been playing my current save on-and-off since last November, with about 130 active plugins, 100 hours, and 1500+ saves under its belt, and it's still perfectly solid, so I wouldn't call save corruption inevitable, either. The engine is... finicky, to be sure, so it certainly can happen, but it's not inevitable except in the longest of long term."
FalloutMods,3d8a4y,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:13:18 2015 UTC,"In that case my friend, I am mighty envious. I suppose inevitable wasn't the right word. The best I can say is that modded Bethesda games seem to have a life of their own from computer to computer. For example, New Vegas for me is as detailed, but on this laptop, I've ran really close to the Skyrim plugin limit without hardly any knowledge on optimization or compatibility (it was essentially right after I'd discovered the Nexus, and I was like a kid in a candy store). I crashed now and then, but not enough to put me off and I finished the playthrough over the course of 8 months. I know Skyrim is worlds more stable for modding than Fallout, but the principle stands.  In my own time playing NV on PC, I've experienced what both OP and sheepandshepherd have outlined multiple times, and it gets buggy enough that I have no desire to work through it and play on, whatever the cause may be. Perhaps my New Vegas just hates me."
FalloutMods,3d8a4y,ulfjack,3,Tue Jul 14 11:49:53 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, I've had more problems modding Skyrim than I have New Vegas. It's much, much easier to run into save bloat problems over a long-term game because of the way Skyrim stores scripts, and I have actually run into a 50-hour save that simply refused to load any more. And I've run into a ton more genuinely inexplicable CTDs in Skyrim than I have in New Vegas (once I sort out things like the 4GB patch, memory patches, etc., I mean). Add to all that the inherent risk of adding/removing mods to an ongoing Skyrim save (again, due to the script situation), and I feel like it's easier to get started with, but ultimately a much more fragile game when it comes to modding. Of course, once a save goes belly-up with Skyrim, there are actual tools out there that give you a decent chance of repairing it, which is a benefit that New Vegas doesn't really have.  In any case, all of Bethesda's Gamebryo/Creation Engine games are buggy enough even before introducing mods to the picture, so please don't think I'm questioning your experience. I put way too much effort into putting together my current load order (seriously, it took about a month, including testing, before I was confident enough to really start playing), and I know that a good deal of it is still down to luck."
FalloutMods,3d8a4y,WildfireDarkstar,2,Tue Jul 14 13:07:28 2015 UTC,"Lol, you're not kidding. Luck seems to be the order of the day with New Vegas for me too. God, it almost makes you wonder if the damn thing's even worth it or not x)  I just lost a save last week that I'm still really bitter from. I'd spent about a week setting it up in March. Considering just forgetting about it all and waiting for Fallout 4. Maybe learn to whittle, or something."
FalloutMods,3d8a4y,ulfjack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:28:06 2015 UTC,"Hmmmmm, I'll have to check out CASM. Is the incremental save function just like going into the menu and saving?"
FalloutMods,3d8a4y,ulfjack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:00:24 2015 UTC,"You can use the original or the MCM version; latter version is configurable through the MCM, and the original has the same options, but hotkeyed to holding down f4. It saves incrementally without you doing anything anywhere from every 5-20 minutes (your choice), and holds anywhere from 5-20 save slots (again, your choice). It means if you crash, you don't even have to worry about saving, because you haven't missed any more than 5 minutes worth of gameplay.  It's an absolute must-have for long or heavily modded playthroughs."
FalloutMods,3d8a4y,ulfjack,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:31:24 2015 UTC,But are the saves the same integrity as a full save through the menu? I know a quick save/autosave is pretty much just a snapshot of the data.
FalloutMods,3d8a4y,gyshall,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:08:15 2015 UTC,"Yep. Better I'd say. My New Vegas is never stable and always fails me within 2-4 months, but since using CASM, not only has it lasted longer, but whenever I crash I'm basically right where it happened, and I haven't lost 40 minutes of game time because I forgot to save. I let it save throughout my current session, then I do a full hard save for the hell of it, then quit. Works like a charm.  Edit: Loading the saves from CASM are fine too. If I goof up I reload my game from a CASM save 10 minutes prior and it works great."

FalloutMods,3d4tdt,thebongdynasty,2,Mon Jul 13 15:38:21 2015 UTC,"Can just changing audio files crash the game? That's literally what the HD Audio overhaul does. Either way, I don't think I can remove it very easily, since I have also encountered a bug in NMM that automatically disables every mod on the ""Mods"" page from a green check mark to a red cross every time I close the application. Strange because I didn't encounter this problem when I was modding Skyrim a month or 2 ago. This breaks uninstalling mods, which means that uninstalling the mod would have to be done manually. What I'm saying is, I would like to be sure what mod is the culprit before I go through the grueling process of restoring the original files which it had changed.  If it is even a mod causing my crash, that is."

That started it up again, but then I had to go back and set everything up again. Fortunately I'd saved a preset in FO3 Configator.   I think you're probably going to have a pretty hard time locating the problem with a mod list that long. A broken NMM definitely doesn't help matters.  You might try re-ordering some of this manually.  http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/2761/? has a good load order for managing some of the bigger mods you're using (FWE an be particularly problematic).  Also, make sure you've got the proper FOIP or Blackened packages installed. I've had better luck with blackened, but I know others prefer FOIP.  http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/4968/? http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/18173/?"

Things like the 4GB patch and NVSE are special cases, because they need to be installed in the game's base folder and not the data/ subfolder. But almost everything else should be installed the way you've been doing it, or you're likely to run into major problems later on if/when you need to uninstall anything."

FalloutMods,3d5fx2,Simplifyze,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:48:47 2015 UTC,"Basically, certain files for mods and DLCs sometimes contain leftover references and records that can cause issues once you start installing more and more mods. If you run LOOT (load order optimization tool) for new vegas and then just hit cancel when it asks you to apply the changes, you will see the report. Go to the details tab and it will tell you exactly which plugins are dirty. Then, you can use FNVEdit to clean them - I would search YouTube for a tutorial."
FalloutMods,3d5fx2,WildfireDarkstar,2,Tue Jul 14 03:04:02 2015 UTC,"You should definitely heed /u/grubbley's advice about the proper way to install things like the 4GB patch. That said, most of the things you mention won't actually prevent the ""Out of Memory!"" error even when they're installed correctly. Despite the generic description of the message, that's actually a very specific kind of problem that isn't addressed by the kind of things you'd think. It's telling you that it's run out of a specific pool of memory (the initial default heap) that's hard coded to have a maximum size of 200MB. Things like the 4GB patch don't change that: it makes more memory available to the game overall, but that initial heap is still set to 200MB. Generally speaking, if you run out of general memory (which the 4GB patch increases), you don't get an error message at all, you just crash silently to desktop.  That said, there is another tool available that will allow you to increase the size of the initial default heap, which should at least reduce the problem. The New Vegas Script Extender does a bunch of things, but for this purpose, it also includes a backport of a patch developed by Skyrim modder Sheson that addresses the same problem there. The instructions for setting it up are available in EssArrBee's excellent ""Fear and Loathing"" guide for modding New Vegas (look for the section on NVSE in case the anchor link doesn't work properly). As with the 4GB patch, you cannot install NVSE directly using FOMM."

LOOT, on the other hand, is the more powerful child of BOSS. Same team of developers, better engine. It has more features and is being actively supported."
FalloutMods,3d3d24,DirtyWeaselMedia,2,Mon Jul 13 05:11:48 2015 UTC,Thanks
FalloutMods,3d3d24,WildfireDarkstar,3,Mon Jul 13 05:15:50 2015 UTC,"LOOT was developed by the same people as BOSS. I believe it even started as an update to BOSS before they decided to give it a new name. So, on one hand, LOOT is just the more up-to-date and currently-maintained version of BOSS.  In terms of how they both work, BOSS doesn't do anything except look at plugin names. It then compares the names to a list of every known plugin (the master list) it downloads from the Internet. That last tells it which plugin goes where, and it builds a load order from that. The problem with this approach is that it obviously can't do anything with a plugin if the master list doesn't know about it. Which meant that the master list was both an enormous beast, and still didn't handle more obscure (or user merged, or whatever) plugins very well.  LOOT, on the other hand, works first and foremost by actually analyzing the plugin files themselves. Each plugin contains a list of the plugins it depends upon. LOOT analyzes this list and knows that if plugin C depends upon plugin B, and plugin B depends upon plugin A, then the load order has to be A-B-C. LOOT also uses a master list, like BOSS, but it's much smaller and used to handle special cases where a plugin needs to be loaded at a certain place in the load order for other compatibility reasons.  Long story short, LOOT is a much more intelligent, versatile, and reliable tool than BOSS ever was. That's only getting more true as time goes on, since the master list that BOSS depends on isn't being regularly updated any more."
FalloutMods,3d3d24,intergalacticninja,3,Mon Jul 13 06:35:34 2015 UTC,"From the LOOT FAQ:   What happened to BOSS v3?  LOOT is BOSS v3. It got turned into a separate utility because concerns were raised about the major changes in expected functionality between v2 and v3.  Do I have to switch from BOSS to LOOT?  No. However, most of BOSS's current contributors are now more interested in contributing to LOOT, so BOSS will likely lag further behind in getting unrecognised plugins recognised as time goes on. One of the many improvements in LOOT is that it has no unrecognised plugins.  How can LOOT not have unrecognised plugins?  To sort a plugin, BOSS needs it to be added to its masterlist, which is hand-ordered by its maintainers. LOOT instead reads the contents of each plugin to see which plugins conflict, etc. and uses that information to decide on the best ordering. This means that it can sort all plugins without needing them to become recognised first.  Does LOOT sort based only on plugin content?  No. While it can sort most plugins correctly, sometimes it gets things wrong, and LOOT's masterlist is used to provide metadata so that it can sort such plugins correctly. Unlike in BOSS, LOOT's masterlist doesn't give specific load order positions, which makes it more adaptable and easier to maintain.  How can the load order LOOT gives be right if BOSS gives a very different load order?  There can be more than one correct load order for a given set of plugins. For example, some plugins may not conflict or depend on each other, so their relative orders wouldn't matter. The load order BOSS gives is hand-made to look 'neat' as well as work, so plugins from the same mod will usually get grouped together, but LOOT doesn't know which plugins belong to which mod, so it just puts them where it thinks they work."

FalloutMods,3d1act,Quazs,3,Sun Jul 12 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"While technically possible, it's no easy task. Actually pretty much the hardest task I can think of for someone who's not very experienced in Fallout modding, because it requires advanced knowledge on both scripting and creating UI's. There's plenty of documentation on scripting and countless examples to learn from. This is not so much the case with UI's though, you're pretty much on your own there since nobody has taken the time to do proper UI tutorials, which is a shame.   Basically, if you're learning everything from scratch it's likely you'll end up spending more time modding than you'd ever spend in the actual inventory.  Just to show you that mods like these are technically possible, check out xilandro's realtime inventory, which was never released for some reason.  If you're gonna try and go through with it, make sure to utilize the GECK Wiki and gribbleschnibit's NVSE docs. Also check out UIO and read up on how to set up your mod with it, this will make compatibility with other UI mods a breeze. Most importantly download other mods and try to learn from them as much as you can.  But I don't know man... I hate to be negative, but the dedication required to do this will make it very difficult to see it through."
FalloutMods,3d1act,bandlek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:28:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the links, I never heard about xilandro's realtime inventory, it looks awesome.

Unfortunately I'm not aware of anything like this, hopefully someone else can help with that.  I realize this isn't a solution for what you're looking for, but I thought I'd suggest Darnified UI and an inventory sorter mod (I just use the option in project nevada). I'm guessing you've already tried most of the UI mods, but I found that the inventory sorting made the inventory menu significantly better. It just ads a prefix like Aid, Chem, food, etc so all similar items are grouped together.   Again, I realize this isn't even close to what you're looking for, but if all else fails I think it might help make the inventory more tolerable for you."

FalloutMods,3d0c37,SunshineBlind,2,Sun Jul 12 12:51:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the idea, I'll look into them.. but they sound like they just make it a little easier to do what I'm already doing.  I'd like something that adds an actual game mechanic in for trading, if possible."
FalloutMods,3d0c37,SunshineBlind,2,Sun Jul 12 13:00:42 2015 UTC,"It's decent for immersion to have at least Betsy, as it's standard for caravans to have at least one pack brahmin.  Don't know how exactly you want a mod to change the barter in game though."
FalloutMods,3d0c37,rocktheprovince,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:19:44 2015 UTC,"The Wasteland Economy one certainly doesn't make it easier. Everything is more expensive, prices are location based, and there are 6 or so factors that can degrade items in your inventory.  Relating to your request, that means   A) Buying something in the Mojave Outpost will have a totally different value in the BoS bunker or in Freeside. So you can do merchandising that way.   B) During your journey, your items will degrade if you go for a swim with them in your invo, get burnt or shot with a laser, or leave your food out of a refrigerator for too long. Things like pilot lights and weaker armors will straight up break if you get hit by a bat too many times. Etc.  C) You wouldn't sell corn to the NCR or regular guns to the BoS. Selling drugs to the Atomic Wrangler might be a good idea, but probably not Mick and Ralf or the Followers. You'll have to get used to these locational differences by considering the lore and some trial and error.    It doesn't necessarily add a new trading mechanic but it does vastly improving existing trading, and adds new features that make it more difficult and atmosphere-oriented. I'd say definitely pick it up, you might be surprised how close it is to what you're looking for."

Skyrim was already compatible with the ability to add more than one weapon on your persons (almost makes me think that they meant to actually add multi weapon display to the game itself), granting easy access to a mod such as equipping overhaul, but FO3 and FNV didnt have this engine pre built in the game, so such a mod would be quite hard to design.

FalloutMods,3czgce,NeroIV,2,Sun Jul 12 04:35:37 2015 UTC,Did you install these all at once? Also you need to turn on archive invalidation in nmm which should fix the textures. Also run LOOT.

FalloutMods,3czgce,ulfjack,2,Sun Jul 12 07:03:09 2015 UTC,"This isn't going to be much help, and you may completely disagree with me and that's fine, but I'll tell you anyway. I have never, ever had a good run with Fallout 3 with a big load order (for the Fallout games, I'd put that around 30+, whereas for Skyrim I'd put it over 100). They don't really mod that well in comparison to other games, and Fallout 3 is notorious for being one of the worst to get stable when adding a lot of mods. New Vegas can generally hold its own, but 3 is just a bitch to get stable.  Your load order looks generally fine, maybe run BOSS (I don't use LOOT for Fallout, it always bastardizes my load order) one more time. Maybe it was the way you installed it, but honestly, I'd put 50 bucks on it being simply too many mods. If I were you, I'd narrow it down to 30 or so of your must-haves, clean install and try again. I can almost guarantee you won't have as many instant, game breaking problems. But hey, you may be far more experienced than me with modding and know more ins and outs - I'm just going off personal and friend-based experience :)"

The disintegration feature can be disabled in the mod configuration menu. I think it's an attempt at balancing difficulty so you can't get too rich and powerful off all those tech raiders with miniguns and power armor.   I don't mind it because it makes it more rewarding when you do find the good stuff in containers, and it reduces the mental burden of constantly micromanaging inventory and carry weight because I have to grab everything."

FalloutMods,3cz14c,Subzer0o,2,Sun Jul 12 02:11:20 2015 UTC,"A little true, I have listened to days worth of acoustic material from a good friend, it doesn't necessarily sound electric but rather through a mic and PA, but by lore friendly I mean the words, being about a dragon attack in Rorikstead. I imagine the artist wanted it to sound as good as possible being that it was an attempt at self-promotion. But stuff like that is what I mean. The other songs in that mod sound considerably less mechanically helped, this was the best quality song IMO and that's why I chose to record that specific one.  EDIT: a couple snippets of the others https://youtu.be/Gxz3PzZhQUY , in a hall that's not too far off. My buddies man cave gives off a similar echo-chamber type reverb.

You know how some mods ""initialize"" just after you've left the house in Goodsprings (such as all the DLC's, memos pop up to let you know they've been loaded)? It could be that your ""more perks"" mod doesn't initialize until this or another thing in the Mojave ""triggers"" it.  With everything I know about GECK modding (I'm intermediate), I don't think it should be necessary to ""initialize"" additional perks in that way, but perhaps this mod did it that way for whatever reason. It might be worth a try to take the train to the Mojave and see if they work after that."

But Novac is really cool because it adds a farm, park, some barricades, and gates. Really fills out the city.  And definitely none of them conflict with someguy series mods or any other quest mods I've tried. The only thing is whoever you send to Boone to kill in the vanilla quest will get stuck on the gate.

FalloutMods,3cro2s,OriginalSpacesuit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:02:51 2015 UTC,Well you only need FWE and RH_Ironsights. I think on RH_Ironsights modpage there is an FWE-RH Bridge which makes RH work with FWE guns.   I recommend getting a mod manager if you dont already have one to simplify the process.

I also apologize in advance if my advice doesn't help.  It seems to me from reading the comments that you're trying to install this preset for ENBoost v203. Don't. Let's clean the slate first, and install everything properly using up-to-date versions of ENB.  First off, clean out ENB and ENBoost from wherever any of their files are installed. Just completely uninstall ENBoost for now. We're going to get ENB without a preset working before you add a preset.  Now, make sure you are using the stock updated version of the 4gb loader, no 'enb-variant' or anything like that. Make sure that in MO it still has the augment ""-laaexe .\FalloutMO.exe"", and make sure that the game is launching through said FalloutMO.exe.  Download the most recent ENB version here: http://enbdev.com/mod_falloutnv_v0278.htm. There will be a ton of files here, but only extract the following: ""d3d9.dll"", ""enblocal.ini"", ""enbseries.ini"", and ""enbhost.exe"". Place these files in the New Vegas install directory, and make a COPY of d3d9.dll to put in the exes folder. Have it exist in both places, it probably won't hurt anything. This step should be done manually, of course.  Now, open enbseries.ini and under [global] change the parameter ""UseEffect=true"" to ""false"". This will disable any visual enhancements, which you don't need at this stage because we're just testing.  In enblocal.ini, change ""ExpandSystemMemoryX64=false"" to true, and ""ReduceSystemMemoryUsage=false"" to true. Let's use the default memory values for now. Set ""AutodetectVideoMemorySize=true"" to false, because it always gets it wrong.  Now, attempt to start the game. The ENB message should appear in the top-left corner of the game, and once you get into the game proper there should be zero graphical change what-so-ever. That's exactly as intended. Press shift-enter to open the ENB menu.  From here, this can go two ways:  If it opens? Congrats, you've sucessfully installed ENBoost, and we can start working on installing your ENB preset of choice so that you can have the graphics enhancements.  If it doesn't open, or you don't get the message top-left message? There is something deeply wrong with your setup and we will need to go back and clean up everything that was done wrong and re-do it the right way. That could include a complete start over, and a fresh clean reinstall of the whole game. But that'd be a more extreme measure.  Whatever happens after trying this, I'll try my best to help you every step of the way to getting this ENB installed."
FalloutMods,3cq6d8,GoldenDiamonds56,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:07:39 2015 UTC,"Okay, I followed your guide to the letter and everything works. I can open the menu and all. This is fantastic!

Well if you don't want anything, you could add my steam and say hi http://steamcommunity.com/id/chriszszszs/  There is just one last problem... but this is literally the last thing from an optimal game. My HUD is mostly invisible now. I had to enable some ENB transparency fix in the settings because some of the terrain went invisible. Is this an easy fix or do I just live with a mostly invisible HUD? My pipboy works fine.   I couldn't google the issue either, it just gives me unrelated stuff :-("
FalloutMods,3cq6d8,imacrazysloth,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:26:08 2015 UTC,"That's odd. First off, transparency problems like the invisible terrain are caused by overlays. The steam community overlay, Overwolf, afterburner, ect. ENB doesn't play nice with those, so turn them off if you continue to have transparency problems.  Now, the HUD shouldn't even be affected by ENB. You could shift-enter the ENB menu and toggle [use effect] to enable or disable ENB shader enhancements on the fly and test if it does anything. I also just read of a person who had a similar issue, and their solution was just to turn up the HUD transparency slider in the game options, as it somehow went to zero.  What are your UI mods, if any?"
FalloutMods,3cq6d8,rocktheprovince,2,Fri Jul 10 15:49:17 2015 UTC,"Oh my god... the transparency HAD somehow set itself to zero. putting it up at max fixed it. Thank you so much.

FalloutMods,3cq6d8,rocktheprovince,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:58:46 2015 UTC,Are you using the updated version of the 4gb loader?
FalloutMods,3cq6d8,rocktheprovince,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:48:49 2015 UTC,Yup.
FalloutMods,3cq6d8,rocktheprovince,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:50:39 2015 UTC,"First thing is go back to the wrapper version.  I've always just put the .dlls in the main folder, it's never worked for me in the exe folder. But my preset works just fine.   When you load your game, if all is working correctly, you'll see two messages. The first lets you know that ENBoost is working, and is in white. I'm guessing that's what you're seeing.  The second message is in yellow and comes afterwards. It tells you how to customize your ENB in game. If you see this message, it means your preset is working. If not, it's not.   First thing you'll want to check is your enblocal.ini  Under [GLOBAL] do you see a line that says;   UsePatchSpeedhackWithoutGraphics=true   ?  Also, which version of that ENB are you using? Looks like there are 3 variants.   EDIT: It looks like all 3 ENBs have option versions of the 4GB launcher. Are you using that launcer, or the standard 4GB one?   The instructions say:   Copy the files from the fnv4b_nsve folder into your main fallout new vegas root directory. The same place we put all out ENB files.  This is an older version of the FNV 4GB Launcher for NVSE that works fine with ENBseries.  This version does not move the .exe files into a new folder.  Only use this if you are having problems with the current and up to date 4GB launcher!   I would be careful using that, and maybe consider using a different ENB. The new 4GB loader is much better."
FalloutMods,3cq6d8,rocktheprovince,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:04:52 2015 UTC,"I am using this version of enb http://enbdev.com/download_patch_falloutnv.htm  I don't see that specific line you're talking about, only SpeedHack=true under perfomance.  What ENB versions are you referring to? I can only find one version, the one I linked."
FalloutMods,3cq6d8,IAMPOUNDCAKE,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:14:09 2015 UTC,You downloaded this too right?  That's the ENB preset. What you linked to is just ENBoost.

FalloutMods,3cq6d8,GoldenDiamonds56,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:29:37 2015 UTC,"Did you copy the files from the fnv4gb_nvse folder into your main folder as well, as per the instructions I quoted?   The first message only tells you that ENBoost is running. ENBoost is just a tool that enables ENB presets and other fixes.   After that message there should be a second message, in yellow, that tells you your preset is working. If that isn't appearing, it means your game doesn't know you're trying to run an ENB."
FalloutMods,3cq6d8,aaronhowser1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:36:37 2015 UTC,"Where and what folder is ""fnv4gb_nvse folder""? The supposed ENB-friendly one is just called ""Optional ENB Friendly 4GB Launcher"", and I get that from the ENB preset (Esethorium).   There's no folder called fnv4gb_nvse in the ENBoost, so I've really no idea where I should get it from?  I only get the ENBoost message. Nothing after that. Just says ENB is running, version number, no yellow text.  Sorry, I'm really a doofus at all this. And it's driving me insane."

MMM I wouldn't really recommend as I believe it adds a lot of creatures that aren't lore friendly. It's a good mod in implementation just be aware of the potential discrepencies with lore. Y'know, if you care about that sort of thing."
FalloutMods,3cqp2g,Exfade,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:53:51 2015 UTC,"FWE may be a little complex at first but MMM is worth minor confusion just because it makes the mutants look nicer and add some depth to combat with the mutants.

FalloutMods,3cqp2g,lgost,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:44:19 2015 UTC,"High res texture mods are fine, but textures that completely change the original feeling not. They are fine for a second run or more tho.  FWE adds much and despite always prefering vanilla as a first run its a nice choice having bullet time and all the rest of the functions.  MMM i strongly suggest not to use as it adds lore unfriendly monsters that are completely out of place or plain frustrating and change your perception of what the game is especially in the northern exploration parts."

I'm on my phone at work right now so I can't link the nexus page, but there's a file which should do it all for you.

FalloutMods,3cks7a,BeetlecatOne,5,Wed Jul 8 18:24:53 2015 UTC,He mentions it but his installation process is out of date. You no longer need the special NVSE version of the 4GB loader because the standard one now supports NVSE. The game will not run if you use 4GBNVSE.

FalloutMods,3co4xi,Salluci,2,Thu Jul 9 19:05:47 2015 UTC,A lot of people seem to have a misconception that 4GB loader + ENB requires a bunch of extra steps and workarounds. I don't really get it.
FalloutMods,3co4xi,rocktheprovince,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:11:15 2015 UTC,"Did the loader change recently? The problem was that it created a patched copy of FalloutNV.exe in a subdirectory. Since ENB works by looking in the same directory as the game executable for d3d9.dll, and d3d9.dll doesn't exist in the 4GB loader's subdirectory, the ENB was never initialized.  It's fairly simple to provide a command line argument to fnv4gb.exe so that it creates the patched FalloutNV.exe in the original game directory, but ""out-of-the-box,"" at least, it doesn't do that by default, so it doesn't play well with ENBs. Or didn't used to, at least."
FalloutMods,3co4xi,WildfireDarkstar,3,Sat Jul 11 02:40:16 2015 UTC,Perhaps that could've been before the updated loader came out? Looks like it was uploaded in 2014:  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/55061/?
FalloutMods,3co4xi,rocktheprovince,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"I was pretty sure that my copy is more recent than that, but I wouldn't bet my life on it. Ah, well. Nice to know, anyway."
FalloutMods,3co4xi,WildfireDarkstar,3,Sat Jul 11 12:24:57 2015 UTC,"It probably is, it was uploaded in 2014 but has been updated as recently as this year.

FalloutMods,3cnhpa,rocktheprovince,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:19:37 2015 UTC,"I have tried the different zombie mods out there, and by far Endless Warefare is the best zombie mod around.   Set the settings to:  Zombie spawn count: 10 (or less if you have performance issues. 10 isn't bad tho) All other spawn counts: 0  Set the 'no spawn chance' to ~40 or less. (less = more zombies)  Set the respawn feature to respawn every 1 or 2 game days.   Enable random spawning. This way you will come across large herds, small groups, and individual zombies for variety.   Set zombie health to ~10 and damage to ~100  Either select 'zombies always run' or whatever speed you'd like.   Turn on settlement spawns.  Turn on interior spawns if you want to.  Set the zombie wander distance to the highest amount.   There's also a setting to treat zombies like ghost people, where you have to cut off a limb to fully kill them. I like to enable that too.  Don't enable zombie infections, it's too unstable.   ///  If you do all that, you'll have a full fledged apocolypse. Some quests might break, but the main quests will only break (due to characters dying) if you enable interior spawns. These zombies are easy to kill but still rip through just about everything in the mojave due to their large groups and high attack. Traveling openly requires some planning and a lot of strategy. The ladders mod comes in really handy.   XRE cars is good to have on top of that.  EDIT:  You can use this with DUST if you like, but it'd be a bit too much for me personally. You might want to tone down the spawn count to 5 or 6 if that's what you do."

What I mean is that I'm at 60fps mostly but i get a lot of drops to ~40 which is more annoying than just playing at 40fps lol. This only happens in the warzone areas however.   YMMV."
FalloutMods,3cmc2q,Konork,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:03:16 2015 UTC,"Use LOOT for your load order.   I don't know if your problem is explicitly memory related, but you haven't already, make sure you have skse, the 4gb memory patch (which you should use to run/launch the game) and the stutter remover. These utilities will have no effect on your save game.   If you already use those then I'm not sure how else to help unfortunately."
FalloutMods,3cmc2q,rotorain,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:59:30 2015 UTC,"Quick question, about how many different items were there in your inventory? Because the game lags when you try to access an inventory if one of them is crammed with a ton of stuff, and if it was happening with all of them, it's likely that it was your inventory causing problems. It probably would have been easier to just empty it out somewhere rather than reinstall if that was the case, especially since if you start hoarding items later, even if it was vanilla, you'll just run into the problem again anyway."

FalloutMods,3cmc2q,Scizo1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:26:07 2015 UTC,As suggested by others: run LOOT once for fixing (most) of load order conflicts.  For lagged looting and menus use Zans Autopurge mod.

FalloutMods,3cluw4,Jay444111,2,Thu Jul 9 00:19:28 2015 UTC,"Nipton Rebuilt is really cool, IMO, but it's not entirely fleshed out. The high point is all the awesome unique stuff the author packed into there. I'm a big fan of that author because they do that with all their mods; it's just full of well-made custom stuff. From a gameplay perspective it wasn't really the best, and you might be better off using Real Time Settler if you want to go that route. They did recently release a mod called Boom to the Moon that you should check out tho if you want a quest mod.  If you're not familiar, Real Time Settler lets you start a town and raise it from the ground up. You can open shops and a bunch of other things. There's even war and diplomacy. If/when you learn the basics of it, pick up this mod to make your town feel more like a town and less like a camp."

If it's not that, there's something similar in that mod. You can add the ammo belt from the Tailor Maid mod to pull off the same effect.  There's a good chance it could be one of Drags many hidden/unreleased armors. Everyone always wants them but very few people have them, I guess."

I would recommend turning off User Accout Control in Windows settings and making sure modlist.txt is in its appropriate location.  Also make sure the account you log into Windows with is had admin rights.

FalloutMods,3ci0dy,Josrence44,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:16:14 2015 UTC,"That's pretty weird, I'm not sure. You could try making a consumable item, just like a stimpak and adding a fix to your script - each time the item is used (or consumed), add one of it to your inventory (so you have unlimited uses). I'm not sure if that will spam you with ""Repair manual added"" every time you use it or not, but maybe that will work for now?"

I do remember one a while ago which added all sorts of enemies and mutants, it had something to do with aliens and posiedon energy, that added superheroes to New Vegas it was fun to play with but all the mod stuff was so much better than vanilla that the base game stuff was useless so I stopped playing with it."

FalloutMods,3cen8x,Jokkerine,3,Tue Jul 7 19:03:24 2015 UTC,"Yup :) So you can preview what Code Welt's synth sounds like in my mods, if you're curious - D1R3b and the Golden Touch Business & Co terminal use the voices from there. Anyhoo, hopefully one of the links I gave ya will be good for what you're trying to achieve. You can always look around for more speech synths such as ISpeech and give them the ""radio"" or ""telephone"" equalizations for a bit of a ""coming through a speaker"" vibe. :)"

FalloutMods,3cfhza,JK464,2,Tue Jul 7 14:42:56 2015 UTC,"NVEC has an optional file for the merged version of More Perks. You'll need to follow the install instructions carefully though because you have to rename a few folders.  That is probably 6 plugins right there.  Also, #110 NCRTrooperOverhaul.esp is not needed with #109. 109 will do what 110 does and so much more.  In my experience Unlimited Companions (#118) just doesn't work. Get JIP Command and Companion Control. It has an MCM menu with when you can set maximum number of companions. With that you can also get rid of AllCompanionsEssential 2.0b.esp (#100) since you can set companions to essential in the MCM menu too.  Max Level 255.esp (#98) is included in Project Nevada Extra Options or regular PN's MCM menu. I forget which one, but I know that you can set the max level with PN.  Mission Mojave and YUP is overkill for bug fixes. I'd go with YUP for your load order since MM might have some serious conflicts.  I think the two extra CaliberX ESMs (honest hearts and grunt perk) can be removed if you installed the latest version. 4.18 I think.   That should save you a good 10+ plugins without having merge stuff and you'll have a more stable game."

FalloutMods,3ccjzc,AJockeysBallsack,7,Thu Jul 9 14:20:30 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure any companion with a companion wheel like in the vanilla game will get fired. Pretty much any companion unless the modder has intentionally made them bypass those functions will I think.  I'm wrong.
FalloutMods,3ccjzc,Razerix,8,Mon Jul 6 21:29:45 2015 UTC,"this is incorrect. I used Willow and another modded companion. Modded companions always follow until they are told not to and the game doesnt remove them. They are, however not supported for DLC, so they won't say much and especially: They will glitch into the frame during cutscenes. Otherwise you're good to go with them along any DLC quest"
FalloutMods,3ccjzc,Subzer0o,3,Mon Jul 6 21:33:40 2015 UTC,Sweet! Thank you kindly!
FalloutMods,3ccjzc,Razerix,2,Mon Jul 6 21:40:09 2015 UTC,Oh. I don't use modded companions so I was just taking a guess. My bad.
FalloutMods,3ccjzc,IAMPOUNDCAKE,2,Mon Jul 6 21:48:26 2015 UTC,"This actually depends on the companion. Some companions are written outside of the vanilla follower system, some are not. Those that are part will be fired just like normal."
FalloutMods,3ccjzc,Subzer0o,6,Mon Jul 6 21:53:36 2015 UTC,modded followers are usually written in a unique companion script(especially the popular ones) so its a rule of thumb to say that there wont be problems
FalloutMods,3ccjzc,rocktheprovince,2,Mon Jul 6 22:08:02 2015 UTC,Remote Control Companions will let you bring any follow into a DLC.
FalloutMods,3ccjzc,Subzer0o,2,Tue Jul 7 09:01:33 2015 UTC,"on another note: do you really need to go into OWB? usually, the mod authors uses the objects of the game and does not make you activate it ingame or start the quest. (except the house is IN the DLC map)"

FalloutMods,3cedot,papitopaez,6,Tue Jul 7 06:50:27 2015 UTC,"You definitely shouldn't have this many plugins. Anything over 139 will create major errors and/or crashes. This is an engine limitation and cannot be changed. The only way I know to lower the plugins count would be to merge some of them or to create a bashed patch.   Even then, I doubt you could lower it enough. Unfortunately, I think you might have to uninstall some of your mods for your game to work."

FalloutMods,3cedot,LilLymphocyteB,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:09:02 2015 UTC,"Technically the plugin limit for the engine is ~255 but realistically I've never had a good experience with anything around 200. I usually stick with 150 as my absolute max.   Chances are you have a lot of plugins in there that do things other mods already do. Chances are also that you could make a bashed patch and merge like 50 or so of those plugins in to it.  Also, make sure you have User Interface Organizer installed before further troubleshooting any HUD-related issues."

I just wanted to share the first in a rather large tutorial that will focus on installing and setup up Fallout 3 mods using Mod Organizer.   In the series we will be building a stable base game that can be used as a platform for further mods. This series is aimed at beginners but I try to keep the videos short   Episode 1 is more of an introduction but in the next few episodes we will deal with User Interface, Installing FWE, MMM, EVE & Ironsights. Later on we will cover improving both the faces of the NPCs and the PC, textures and weather mods. Compatibility patches will be covered to ensure everything works smoothly.  Let me know if you have any concerns/questions"

It looks like some lines get broken up and other's (such as the aand e have lines that get merged into black blobs. Your intro is a bit too loud. Try placing it at the very start of the video as well, but I don't know what's best in terms of viewer retention for that. Your intro ends a bit abruptly as well. When files are hightlighted in folders, the colour remains white and the files only receive a black border. Since this is a tutorial, I recommend changing it to the default blue or something more visible. You say it doesn't matter where MO is installed but I know I had issues when it was installed to Program Files since Windows puts some stupid security restrictions on that folder. Not saying you should remake the video, but just a suggestion to state issues that may occur for others even if they don't for you.   I'm not experienced in video editing/rendering so I don't know why the first two issues happen and how to fix them.  I like your intro music a lot and the background music is nice as well!"
FalloutMods,3ce0fu,staggindraggin,2,Tue Jul 7 04:25:39 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this'll be of any use but most weather and lighting mods require you to wait 1-2 days in game for the time cycle to catch up with the new files.  Load your save and wait for 24 hours or more and save  Edit- Also, MO 1.2.17 seems to be the most stable version for Fallout. Later versions broke auto Archive invalidation."

There is very little visual feedback from the enemy while there getting shot besides spurts of blood or when you cripple something. The game is not meant to be played like a FPS. Use VATS and the FPS mechanics in a pinch. If anyone has a better idea let me know.

You have both Fellout and DC Moods. As far as I know, these mods may conflict with each other so you may try playing with one of them disabled. Also, I think it's best if you put weather/lighting mods at the end of your load order. Toggle ArchiveInvalidation off and on. You may have already done this, but I guess it doesn't hurt to mention it just in case. If toggling AI off and on doesn't work, you may need to play with your load order since you have MMM. On MMM's installation page, there is a suggested load order. You may want to take a look at it here. Otherwise, you might want to try re-installing the mod. Consider getting the merged patches for MMM and Realistic Interior Lighting to cut down on your .esps. Merged patches by Paradox Ignition can be found here.  I know it might be nothing, but I notice you have FO3 Wanderers Edition - More Gore.esp and no other FWE assets.   This is all I could think of at the moment.

With pictures,things to look for,what clashes with what etc... There are waaay to many simulare posts around here,either people are dumb (sorry but what i see here it really seems so),or to lazy to read it alone,so lets come here and play stupid there's always someone who is willing to solve my problems!  As said if i with my English can run 138+ mods perfectly fine on a solid pc (not even near highend pc's) that i'm not sure how someone can't run even 20 mods correctly!  Non of this goes to you or anything,just generally speaking because everday i see the same questions all over again.  :)"

I've had some retarded moments though... Like in Fallout NV my game kept crashing over and over, so i uninstalled all my mods and the game... the issue was that my save file was corrupted... i felt so dumb once I figured that out :P"
FalloutMods,3c79fe,LordLollipop,2,Sun Jul 5 16:09:42 2015 UTC,":)  I know the feel,i had my struggles at first too,but i figured it out alone and tried to change something. People see they have a load order error,so the easiest is to come to /r/FalloutMods and let others solve my problems! I had 2 times error with load order,i think it's LOGICAL to unthick all mods except the needed ones and DLC's.Then i start thicking back 10 at a time,start FNV and see if it runs ok and so on till i saw that 3 esp's where causing the issue! There you go,10min and problem solved and learned a thing or two how to fix stuff. Don't have to be Einstein right?! Just use 0,0005% of your brain...  Imho it's also highly disrespectful without even trying alone to come here and let others do the dirty work for you. Load order problems is very easy to solve,unthick all mods and slowly thick back step by step!  I have every texture mod out there installed,works great and looks great,people here ask why don't 2 texture mods go and it crashes,i'm thinking wtf???"
FalloutMods,3c79fe,DrVolzak,2,Sun Jul 5 16:44:42 2015 UTC,hahah yea but some people can take lazyness to a whole new level :P! But if there's someone out there that takes pleasure on fixing these kind of things I see no harm with it :)!

The game is out already for a few years,there literally isn't a error that you have in 2015 that someone didn't have in 2012/2013 and that it got solved!  So you open this sub and search for your issue,why make a damn new thread that people already solved 100 times before you came,pretty stupid if you ask me tbh"
FalloutMods,3c79fe,DrVolzak,2,Sun Jul 5 17:02:57 2015 UTC,hahah yea I guess... It can be pretty hard to find a thread with a common issue when you dont know what the issue is... it is pretty ridiculous if people come here without trying to troubleshoot themselves...
FalloutMods,3c79fe,MythShadow,2,Sun Jul 5 17:05:21 2015 UTC,"Seriously now and i mean it hahahaaa  As said i also had load order problems,it depends what you install and when etc...

You open your NMM/MO/FOMM whatever and start comparing yours with there! I mean come on don't play stupid and let others do your shit for you,fuck that seriously!

I can't see how a mod on it's own could cause a blue screen.  Anyway, if you want a stable game, keep away from mods with a lot of scripts. The Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch is a good one to start with as well as Fallout Stutter Remover (FOSE plugin.)

That should run it with the Fallout Script Extender. Hopefully, this works for you. I was having the same problems until I downloaded FOMM and used that. If you're still having issues, then it might be your load order. Try to post that so we can get a better idea of what we're working with.

FalloutMods,3c9jio,intergalacticninja,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:10:44 2015 UTC,I think all the Paradox Ignition merged versions needs all the DLCs for it to work. What DLCs do you have? Do you only have the vanilla game?  I believe the cause of the crash with your installation is that you only installed 'RH_IronSights BETA Update 1'. You need to install 'RH_IronSights BETA' before ''RH_IronSights BETA Update 1' (overwriting all existing files from the first RH_IronSights installation). Delete all .ESP files of DLCs you don't have - e.g. remove RH_IronSights_Basic_AnchoragePlugin.esp if you don't have Operation Anchorage.

FalloutMods,3c8mze,Gibusmann,3,Sun Jul 5 22:47:51 2015 UTC,"People don't recoil when hit by bullets, not in the way you see on tv and in movies. Bullets penetrate and spend the inertia they have causing a cavity in the target, a temporary cavity and a permanent one. People hit and killed by bullets typically just drop or continue with whatever momentum they had before being shot. The famous scene in the movie JFK where he keeps repeating, ""back and to the left"" shows a lack of understanding in how bullets wound. Kennedy's head moved not because the bullet pushed the head but because his head split from the cavity made by the rifle round.  But back on track, i don't know if there is a tv and movie style recoil mod, but there is a shotgun perk that adds that cliche and inaccurate push effect."

If you restrict yourself to using sights only, it adds difficulty to the game without changing anything else.   I also like A World of Pain and DC Interiors because they just add more areas to loot and explore. They can make a boring random subway station into a place that has several shops to explore.  Flora Overhaul can really reinforce the setting of the game. I like the devastated version in particular.  Fellout fixes the ugly green tint the game has.

That GOMMORAH.esp that comes with NVR3 caused huge texture issues for me,faces,characters and wasteland textures.Either it removed them,people where pink colored,armes missed,trees hanging weirdly etc...

Get a nice ENB to go with whichever one you choose. Grab NMC's large texture packs and Poco Bueno. Interior Lighting overhaul is a must. Grab Fallout Character Overhaul and wasteland clothing Hi-res for the people. You should also grab EVE, Neat clutter replacer, and various other textures for health packs, drugs etc. Oh and Vurts WFO is also a must. This will give you a very nice baseline, then just go to Nexus Mods and grab whatever your heart desires."

FalloutMods,3c7iuo,Question2005,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:53:28 2015 UTC,"I think so. Some leveled creatures, with their level being dependent by the player's level (PC mult) become pretty hard to take down. I remember on a mod I did there was a dog having some thousands hp on player's high levels, people saying me it was taking ages to take that down. In my opinion, scaling the levels doens't work very well, I believe they used different tiers for that reason. However, coming back to your question, I don't know the formula but probably it's written somewhere in the wiki. But I do feel it has relationship with the health value (under the Stats tab) but then I don't know if it has the same relationship with s.p.e.c.i.a.l.s. as for human actors."
FalloutMods,3c7iuo,CazadoraDeAlmas,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:08:05 2015 UTC,"I figured out that the hp in the stat tab is per level, so that explains why your dog has thousands of hp.  Not sure about damage though.  How do you make tiered creatures?"

FalloutMods,3c69u8,Fertemexican,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:38:42 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you changed all the necessary values in your .ini files? Editing the .ini files to change the FOV is probably the best way since using the console to do it disables Steam achievements for the current game session.  Navigate to your .ini files (C:\Users\username\Documents\My Games\FalloutNV) - you'll have to edit Fallout.ini and FalloutPrefs.ini. Open fallout.ini in Notepad (or Notepad++ which I would recommend getting if you don't have it), press ctrl+f, type fov in the search box and press find next. You'll have to change the following values to your desired fov:  fDefaultFOV  fDefault1stPersonFOV  fDefaultWorldFOV  once you change the value for fDefaultFOV, just press find next again to take you to the next one you need to change, then edit that one, and so on. Then, save fallout.ini, close notepad, then open FalloutPrefs.ini in notepad and change the same values to your desired FOV, then save and close. That's how I got mine to work.  I would also remove any fov mods you have installed in case they interfere with / override these .ini changes"

Even if you don't use mods, features such as console commands, adjustable graphics, save editing/backups, larger communities, and steam's new return program if the game doesn't turn out well, are all compelling reasons to get it on PC."
FalloutMods,3c4v6v,RunsLikeAPussy,10,Sat Jul 4 21:05:33 2015 UTC,The consoles will 99% not get a developer console. I'd stick with PC. It will most likely have controller support anyway if that's one of the appeals of consoles to you.

FalloutMods,3c4v6v,2woToned,4,Sun Jul 5 01:56:07 2015 UTC,"Due to PC inherently being a scalable platform, games -well made ones like fallout atleast- are also scalable graphically. You can most likely achieve much higher than 60 depending on what you want to sacrifice visually. And I haven't seen any verification of what platform the E3 content was shown anyway.  Unfortunately, the answer to your post is almost certainly no. Moreover, many mods will require installation and control outside of the default directories. For example: FNIS*, ENB, Script Extenders, and INI editing all happen outside of the DATA directory, which will most likely be the install directory for mods from bethnet.  Modding for consoles IS a good idea, and I support it. However the truth is that consoles are still to restrictive of a platform to fully implement mods made for PC. Don't feel bad though, the game will be just as fun on whatever platform you choose to run it.  *(While FNIS Does exist inside the DATA folder, it is an executable that must be run natively)"

FalloutMods,3c4xy7,HotshotGT,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:19:00 2015 UTC,Text from post:   For some reason may ENBs I attempt to use have an issue. As soon as I enter combat or fire a gun to many time the game freezes for a second or two and SPM shows that my GPU stops responding during this period. This is 100% a problem caused by some ENBs and I have no Idea why it does this or how to fix it.
FalloutMods,3c4xy7,HotshotGT,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:01:00 2015 UTC,"My bad, I use HoverZoom and just saw the screenshot. Do you have compression enabled in enblocal.ini? Compression uses the CPU to save on GPU resources by compressing them a bit, but it spikes CPU usage and can cause stuttering while it's happening. You could also try upping ""ReservedMemorySize"" to the next increment or lowering ""VideoMemorySize"" in 50mb increments. For the sake of consistency, only modify one variable at a time before testing, then set it back if it has no effect. If the issue only seems to happen on certain ENBs and not others, you could try copying the settings under [Memory] from ENBs without the issue to whatever one is giving you problems. Here is a breakdown of the settings and what they do."

FalloutMods,3c3s6k,Mhoku,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:21:47 2015 UTC,"Was it announced for Fallout 4? I know they brought back different segmented armor but would that do that same thing necessarily? The enemies looked like borderline bullet sponges as per usual. I think it could be done, it basically the same as headshots except for all body parts. It wouldn't be automatic, you'd have to set manually which body parts are shielded by the armor. But the body parts are already separate, someone would just have to write a script. There are object enchantments already in the geck for damageleftarm, head, etc and restore left arm head etc"
FalloutMods,3c3s6k,WireframeNerd,3,Sat Jul 4 16:12:36 2015 UTC,"The mod Realistic Weapon Damages has a very similar effect. This doesn't necessarily change armor but it changes damage output for creatures AND you. It makes weaons act more akin to real life meaning headshots or a few rounds to an unarmored area will kill or severely wound the target.   It is available for Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, and Tale of Two Wastelands.  Note: This mod changes the damage and health values of NPCs and Creatures and if you have a mod that adds new Types of NPCs or Creatures you will need a patch or the enemys will still act as bullet sponges."
FalloutMods,3c3s6k,WireframeNerd,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:10:45 2015 UTC,"I do use that mod. Absolutely essential for me. I think most of the problems people talk about with clunky Bethesda combat is almost completely mitigated with this mod and a similar one for Skyrim. If the game was built that way in the first place, it'd be a lot better and easier to balance. People think the games are too easy but their solution is to crank up the difficulty by making it that you gotta shoot people 100x in the face to kill them. Its more difficult and fun and immersive when you want to avoid getting hit by any bullets, explosions or swords, and if you do you are fucked up and need to get medical attention immediately-- if your not dead. For instance, in Skyrim I use a combination of mods so that blocking is 100% effective in blocking health damage if the block is successful. What is damaged is your stamina, which if it drops to zero you'll be staggered and lower your shield/weapon and then a killing strike can be executed. I use the violens mod for killmoves so a good solid attack that will kill someone always causes a killmove.  The thing is, even with the RWD mod, the headshots are good, but the other limbs aren't necessarily what I'd like it to be. For example, say I am wearing a bulletproof vest and I get hit with small arms fire in the chest, what should happen? The way my game is set up it still does pretty significant damage to me, thats why I was wondering. I had to modify someone else's power armor mods in order to make the power armor impervious to small arms fire. I made the helmet actually the main thing so that when a guy is just wearing pa with no helmet he can't take a million bullets to his head lol. Its a jury rigged trick but it seems to work alright. It would be great if the segmented armor in FO4 means the body parts are armored differently. I wish they would put the body parts distinctions to the next elder scrolls. I like how you limp when wouldn't or other crippling effects, it adds realism. I could be .001 health in Skyrim but the guy still looks and runs around healthy as a horse. In any case, the head needs to be vulnerable for yourself and for enemies and if the chest is armored that should protect the chest but not effect the head or limbs."
FalloutMods,3c3s6k,mtbow,2,Sat Jul 4 21:27:07 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know what you could do. I'm there with you on the hardcore realism train. I just don't think Fallout NV or especially Fallout 3 could have somthing like that implemented without overhauling the entire combat system from the ground up. Especially with scripting and engine limitations. FO4 however looks very promising considering the separated armor pieces and the fact that weapons cause environmental damage. So if is not already partly implemented, realistic locational damage could be added alot easier. Guess we just need to wait for a talented moder to do this exact thing."

FalloutMods,3c3347,AstorReinhardt,2,Sat Jul 4 08:06:28 2015 UTC,"I'm fairly minimalist with my approach. As my recent post here would explain, I basically make sure that Doc Mitchell's house isn't busting at the seams with armors and clothing and weapons. I use a mod to disable the Courier's Stash (or choose one specific loadout) This means you're not leaving his place with an unrealistic amount of gear after you were basically looted, buried and left for dead: http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/44171/?  It's by the guy who does the YUP patches. It works like a charm, just keep it relatively low in your load order.  As far as weapons go, I don't know how you feel about Millenia's stuff, but I always preferred MAIBATSU's stuff. Not only is it better quality, but it explains why such a modern and clean looking weapon would be found in New Vegas - you have to make it at the bench. You won't find, say, a dirty junked up fiend with a military grade semi-automatic that looks like it just rolled off the production line a few months before. I also use the Camon Pack, it's got some nice shotguns.  Hope I could help, this is of course all just me, everyone mods in their own way :)"

FalloutMods,3c30sj,VaultDweller87,3,Sat Jul 4 07:31:50 2015 UTC,FCO has support for willow and niner I'm pretty sure. The difference is easily seen but there's a bit of neck-seam if you use any body mods along with it.
FalloutMods,3c30sj,Callivastor,3,Sat Jul 4 07:53:37 2015 UTC,"I have a few issues with it, but it's only because I play a lot of quest mods (err, I plan to anyway).  The FCO changes don't translate over to the added NPCs unless their's a direct patch, and most of the time there isn't; usually only ones for popular individual follower mods.  I hate going from FCO faces, to doing the Bounties or Bison Steve quest, and everyone looks vanilla again. I'd honestly rather keep a hi-def vanilla than FCO because of this. However, if you don't play any quest mods or that kind of thing doesn't bother you, there's nothing inherently wrong with the mod itself, just a wee touch of a neckseam. Very well done."

So you can certainly have dirty plugins that LOOT doesn't identify as such. Based on your screenshot, the Unique Weapons Retextured entry looks to be identical to the Weapon Mod Kits entry... but I can't say if there's anything not pictured in the screenshot that is different. Records are an all-or-nothing deal: if some mod wants to edit, say, the name of an item, it needs to copy the whole record. That record is different in at least one respect, so it's not an ITM, but it can certainly still override another mod's changes."

Why do some mods, such as FWE, state to not clean their ITMs? How do they rely on ITMs to function?  I'm still confused as to why I can't copy to override on the RH Ironsights bridge.

Currently the game switches your body with a completely different body anytime you put on a full suit of armor like ""Leather Armor"" or ""Vault 21 Suit"". I'm assuming the armor with coats and the like are edited for the lower parts to be attached with their leg movement during animations."

Crashing on startup is almost always a missing master error, but if you're able to your load your whole load order in FNVEdit without problems, that doesn't sound like it. Given that you have a relatively small plugin list, might I suggest disabling each, one by one, starting from the bottom? Once you get the game to load, you'll probably have the culprit."

I am a bit confused by what the ""ENB.exe"" is. In my experience of installing ENBs with FNV4GB, the only adjustment to the installation I make is to put the ""D3D9.dll"" from the ENB into the ""exes"" folder of FNV4GB.  Upon further review of this list, I've noticed that some of the options are disabled. Does that mean that you've just disabled them in the plugin list? were they installed for assets?  I would recommend combing through the mod pages, looking for any incompatibilities. This can take quite a long time, and will be very frustrating (I took a several month break from fnv after a similar experience). I wish you the best of luck in fixing this.   P.S. Maybe install the mods in chunks, test the game for errors. Rinse and repeat until you have isolated the issue. Good luck!"

Edit: I was trying to find that mod. Apparently the INI setting is  bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=1. However, this mod is for NV. It might apply to FO3 too.  Also, here is was author of the Fallout Character Overhaul for NV has to say:   Neckseam will be as bad as it is in vanilla Fallout. My neck area is the same texture as vanilla. The reason there may still be a neckseam is because you haven't archive invalidated or because Bethesda didn't learn about vertex normals (look them up) until Skyrim and they use a terrible EGT face tinting system. Also body mods have even worse vertex normals so there is nothing I can do about it.

FalloutMods,3c29ft,Cr0n0x,2,Sat Jul 4 02:37:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can always make a new bashed patch. The patch never modifies the original plugins. There isn't a hard limit that I'm aware for a bashed patch. However, the game itself has a limit of about 140 plugins (esm and esp.) Disabled plugins still count because it indexes them as well. Again, yes, you can delete your old patch and make a new one. Sure, why not try again. You should patch whatever it tells you to. Admittedly, I've never used Wyre Flash, but from what I know, it does tell you to not include certain plugins in the patch and it also disables certain plugins after it makes the patch. Just follow what it recommends and you should be fine."
FalloutMods,3c29ft,DrVolzak,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:40:26 2015 UTC,But what about the weapon naming? Is that normal or not? It does it with all weapons like S Mercenary Grenade Launcher and even clothes with A Armored Vault suit.
FalloutMods,3c29ft,DrVolzak,2,Sat Jul 4 02:47:08 2015 UTC,A certain mod is naming the weapons that. The reason it doesn't show up without the patch is because you have the plugins sorted in a way that makes it so whichever mod is doing that has its entries overwritten.  Download FNVEdit and load all of your plugins. Select your bashed patch and find the weapon records and see which mod it takes those names from.
FalloutMods,3c29ft,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:52:41 2015 UTC,"It's a feature of the bashed patch itself. When rebuilding the patch, make sure that the ""Tweak Names"" option is not selected.

FalloutMods,3c260j,LorenZ901,2,Sat Jul 4 02:33:27 2015 UTC,"Thank you! It must be a conflict between NV Novac and Niner then, as the only other mod that I believe changed Novac is Willow, and that's one of the bungalows.

FalloutMods,3c260j,ulfjack,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:43:35 2015 UTC,"The Niner quest involves being inside the vanilla layout of the same apartment in Novac. There's a whole scripted scene that plays out in it, and it's based almost solely on how the room is laid out. The Novac mod basically knocks down the right wall and expands the room, as well as reversing it and adding tons of new clutter, furniture and walls.

FalloutMods,3c1zmy,Legion017,2,Sat Jul 4 00:47:21 2015 UTC,"Game crashes on startup are almost always load order related. First, while you plugins for each mod are together, they aren't in the best order:    MCM shouldn't be at the bottom of your loader; should be near the top.  Nevada Skies should be at the very bottom.  FCO shuld be near the very bottom. Eletro-City masters should be right next to each other. (Check out the Readme of this mod, it has a fairly specific guide on load order with this mod.). I've heard YUP and MMUE might not work with each other. Some people say yes, some no. This is because they both fix bugs in the game and therefore conflict with each other.   Have you used LOOT to sort it? LOOT will sort them better but will split up the plugins from a mod (e.g. split up the several Project Nevada plugins you have.) This isn't good and you'll need to move them back together, unless they are compatibility patches: place those under the last mod they patch.  Be sure to redo your merged patch when you're done. Also, try deleting the plugins that are not enabled. You are coming up on the plugin limit (~140) and unchecked/disabled plugins still count towards that limit. I know it's not easy to make that organized with NMM, but do your best."

The GECK then asks you if you want to create a new form, click yes.  But to answer your question. In order to get a .nif file you'll need a BSA Browser (comes with FOMM) to open ""Fallout - Meshes.bsa"". Then you'll need to find and extract the model you want, place it in the proper folder (in Data\meshes, needs to have the exact same path as the one in the BSA otherwise things will go wrong).

I've been struggling for a while to find one that integrates new armour onto enemies and friendlies like what has been done with many weapon mods such as Classic Fallout weapons.   Levelled loot is unfortunately something that many modders don't do for their armour mods, and it kind of sucks. I have not seen one armour pack mod that integrates itself yet and I've chalked that up to clothing simply being harder to create then weapons, hence why you never see them in packs very often.  Though, the ones that are in a pack are still able to be integrated into the levelled loot lists by just doing it yourself, but that requires some GECK knowledge IIRC."

It might just be plain impossible(though I doubt it) or just really difficult and that's why nobody does it, but I'm curious nonetheless. I'll report back if I figure out anything :)"

After you sort it, be sure Project Reality remains at the bottom of your load order. I'd also recommend making sure MCM and Weapon Mod Menu are near the top and that you have all of your weapon mods next to each other.  If that doesn't work, try resetting your graphics settings / INI files by deleting them and using the Fallout Launcher to remake them. Also try a new save. Lastly, if you're using an ENB, try disabling it.  If none of this works, post your load order again (this time with better formatting please, you can edit your post you know...) and I'll see what else could be wrong."

Then, what I do is I open up fnvedit and see if there are any compatibility issues (it will stop scanning your mods and tell you which mod it was trying to load when it found the error). After I get the game to actually start, I make a merged patch through fnvedit and make sure it is loaded after everything in my load order. Start up the game and you should be good to go.

The merge patch will combine like values across mods to further increase compatibility and stability.  If you want to be even more stable, you'll need to actually combine like plugins.

I know they use Papyrus now, but I used to mod for Oblivion and scripting wasn't too difficult. It was very easy to find an example of a script you want to emulate from the vanilla game and then look at other examples to tweak it the way you want.   It definitely doesn't require a degree or anything."
FalloutMods,3burg1,captaincannibal,2,Thu Jul 2 11:30:35 2015 UTC,"When I taught myself modding skills (for other games), what I did was watch tutorials and try to follow along and emulate what they did, they add some of my own ""tweaks"" to it with my limit knowledge. This allows you to get more familiar with the tools and the programming language that you're using.  Try to look up how to do very very basic things, things that are probably useless to you in-terms of an enjoyable mod, but useful in terms of building your skills. A lot of people get ahead of themselves and try to learn modding for a specific, advanced thing they want to do and get frustrated. Start simple.  The other important thing is that you need to have motivation. You need to be enjoying yourself and never feel like something is a chore. If something is challenging, you need to enjoy the challenge. If you don't have the motivation or you're not enjoying it, you will not get very far in my opinion."

I'd suggest starting with Python. It's well-documented and has plenty of tutorials for those just starting out. Once you feel you've mastered Python, move on to other languages. Learning a real programming language will equip you with all the necessary tools to tackle the hideous monstrosities that are TESScript and Papyrus."

Also, EVERYTHING from the enb folder goes into the main folder where the fallout exe is located, this includes files and d3d9.dll files.  About the injector version, I'm thinking you installed the Wrapper version wrong but if you didn't, you might be able to get the injector one working. What you do is simple, put the files from the injector version (Injector.ini, enbseries.dll and enbinjector.exe) into the main folder and then add the 4gbexe to the ini and you're done.(Also, run the injector before running the game)"

Unlimited companions isn't a bad idea, depending on what difficulty you play on, where you want the game to balance, etc. Signature Armor & Signature Weapons, another mod I won't willingly abandon. DLC weapon integration adds DLC weapons like the .45 auto into the vanilla leveled lists. Classic Fallout Weapons adds weapons from older Fallout titles into the vanilla leveled lists.  (It works with TTW, I've had DC Raiders carrying weapons from this mod.)   There are others that I consider 'must-have', but these are the basics for me.  For adding mods, either NMM or FOMM will do just fine under normal circumstances."
FalloutMods,3bte26,Attacker732,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:13:26 2015 UTC,"Now that TTW is installed, can I install NMM and start using it? Would it mess with the existing setup?  I've read several places about needing to repack multiple mods into fewer (or one) mod when using TTW - how do I do this (and why aren't there some of these 'repacked' mods available as a group to DL)?  Also - I did notice the BB rifle I got in the vault seemed massively underpowered compared to my memories of playing FO3 - not that I spent a TON of time in V101, but I played through enough new characters to remember it. I used to be able to one-shot the rad roaches with VATs and a good headshot, and actually take out the guards with a reasonable number of BBs (4-8). The rad roaches were taking 6-10 headshots, and against the guards the BB rifle was absolutely useless. Is this indicative of all weapons in the game (have the weapons lost power), or was this done to rebalance the BB rifle, or is this a bug, or...? And will any of the mods you mentioned address this (whether it is just the one weapon, or most/all weapons)?"
FalloutMods,3bte26,Attacker732,2,Thu Jul 2 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"First, feel free to use NMM for installing new mods/tweaking your load order.  Second, I'm not really sure about repacking mods.  I haven't done it yet, and haven't really heard much about it up to this point.  Third, I'm not sure.  I'd guess that the BB gun is using NV's damage instead of FO3's damage.  (It's not all weapons, the combat shotgun is still brutal, despite being a 20 gauge shotgun for some reason...)"

It does not matter if you use NVSE or some other launcher, they all eventually go through Fallout3.exe anyway. You don't need ArchiveInvalidation Invalidated because NMM has a built-in option for it (you just need to find it; I don't use NMM so I can't help there.) Yeah, you can get Fallout Stutter Remover. If you want to use an ENB, then you'll need the ENB libraries. That's about all I can think of. Read the previous point. If you want a simple retexture, I'd recommend Hi-res Weapons. Some more mods: Better Clutter, Flora Overhaul, and the rest that I can't be bothered to link. Yes. Here are some incompatibilities I do know of should you decide to get more mods: Sprint is not compatible with FWE since FWE has its own sprint mechanic. RH_Ironsights needs patches for FWE, EVE, and WMK. For FWE on NMM, download the files manually, extract them into one folder, and then re-archive them into a .zip or .rar and then NMM should be able to install it. Yes, LOOT can be installed anywhere. LOOT will make a good load order if you have few mods. However, it doesn't do a great job when you have a huge list. Either way, I'd recommend reading the descriptions and Readmes of the mods. For example, if you plan to install FWE, you should check the bottom of the description for a sample load order."

FalloutMods,3bobw8,IAMPOUNDCAKE,0,Wed Jul 1 03:47:59 2015 UTC,NVEC is a chunk of your problem. Half the mods in your list are incompatible. There is no reason to include it with that sort of list anyway.
FalloutMods,3bobw8,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:59:58 2015 UTC,"NVEC is perfectly fine. With longer load orders like this, you'll need a couple of compatibility patches, but it's nothing insurmountable. The only real issue I see with the load order is that it's creeping awfully close to the 139 esp hard limit, and I've never been able to get more than ~132 eps without running into issues (meshes not loading after changing cells, etc.)."
FalloutMods,3bobw8,WildfireDarkstar,2,Tue Jun 30 23:56:19 2015 UTC,I tend to agree with you. After some tweaks on the ini files from the game and the Stutter Remover i've been getting rock solid stability. Only problem i still have is that iHUD still won't work but i believe it's probably a question of either load order or the order i have the mods on Mod Organizer.
FalloutMods,3bobw8,IAMPOUNDCAKE,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:03:49 2015 UTC,NVEC is perfectly fine.   Its really not. Especially when it comes to bug fix mods. NVEC in general is pretty notorious for being a shitshow under the hood.
FalloutMods,3bobw8,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:29:16 2015 UTC,"It really is. Most of the ""bug fix mods"" it conflicts with are horror stories in their own right, and redundant alongside NVEC in the first place. You can't run it and YUP at the same time, sure, but that's not an inherent problem with either: they're just redundant, in the same way as YUP and MMUE. The same caveats apply to NVEC that would apply to any large load order (since it's basically just a pre-merged mod pack), of course: you should have a general idea of what you're getting into, and be willing to do a bit of research/leg work, but assuming a basic level of familiarity, it's no more difficult than any other mod. I've been running it alongside TTW, Project Nevada, and WMX for over 200 hours, and it's rock solid."
FalloutMods,3bobw8,IAMPOUNDCAKE,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:12:29 2015 UTC,Are you the same rtard I got into it with a week or so ago? Cause running it with TTW is stupid. To the point they blatantly tell you not to run it.
FalloutMods,3bobw8,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:20:36 2015 UTC,"No, but I'm more than happy to get into it with you now. :-)  NVEC absolutely won't work alongside TTW without a patch (it has the same problem as a number of performance and bug fix mods, in that it disables legacy Fallout 3 assets present but unused in vanilla New Vegas but crucial for a working TTW installation). But there are multiple patches for it out there that fix those problems, and the TTW team members have been active participants in the threads about that. It's not ""officially supported,"" sure (but what is?), but plenty of people (myself included) have gotten through the game without any incident using Shardoom's most recent patch (from December 2014)."
FalloutMods,3bpd1m,Noobpwnerking,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:01:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not expert on load orders but it looks fine, use LOOT if you're unsure about the load order, as for your system specs, it says 200 series, but the 4 GB of vram says to me it's a R9 290x, no?  Do you have any ENBs on? If so that would be why.  I have an ASUS 660ti and AMD Phenom X6 1100T CPU and I get roughly 45-60 FPS, 30-45 FPS in more demanding areas...

FalloutMods,3bpd1m,darkpunk1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:56:36 2015 UTC,"I would like to advise, loot does not always have the best load orders to use, especially if any of the mods you have installed specifically state what they need the load order to be. It's similar to how it works with TTW, if you diverge from the proper recommended load order it could mess up your entire game and make it unplayable."
FalloutMods,3bpd1m,DrVolzak,1 point,Wed Jul 1 10:08:32 2015 UTC,I think it reports 799Mhz because that's how dual channel memory works. x2 would make that 1600Mhz.
FalloutMods,3bpd1m,Iziama94,0,Wed Jul 1 06:35:11 2015 UTC,"It is definitely not a CPU bottleneck, the 8350 is an 8 core with 4.0 Ghz, it would take a lot to bottleneck it, like around a tri SLI Titan Xs or 3 Fury Xs"
FalloutMods,3bpd1m,darkpunk1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:39:48 2015 UTC,"One thing for you to remember sir, it is not optimized for anything more than a dual core, meaning that anything larger than that it does not know what to do with the excess cores and thus can bottle neck the system."
FalloutMods,3bpd1m,Iziama94,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:41:19 2015 UTC,I thought that was just Fallout 3 and they fixed it in New Vegas?

FalloutMods,3bpd1m,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:25:37 2015 UTC,"Fallout 3 suffered from a critical bug with CPUs that had more than 2 cores that made it extremely unstable. New Vegas fixed that, but it's still not optimized for any more than 2 cores. It doesn't freak out in the presence of a quad core machine, but it doesn't draw much benefit from one, either."
FalloutMods,3bpd1m,darkpunk1,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:48:38 2015 UTC,"So first things first, one thing you need to check is how many actual active mods you have, as well as how many active plugins there are, from what I can see of your list you have there, you have a very large amount of mods active, which in many cases can cause the bogging down, as well as I would like to advise you that the game was built for and recommended to be used with a dual core processor so anything higher than that it is not optimized for, as well as the operating system on your computer, it recommends windows XP or vista. It probably bottle neck also because you do not have any optimization mods on it to make it perform better on the newer system."

FalloutMods,3bol3y,RedTailedLizerd,2,Tue Jun 30 21:51:51 2015 UTC,"Hey. The overwrite files are just from UIO, the FOSE plugin that handles UI mods. I have them too and I leave them alone; they're harmless and can stay there. I would recommend deleting the mods you tried to create out of those files. In the overwrite folder, you may also find files from FO3Edit if you use it to create a merge patch or clean your vanilla plugins as well as backups it makes. For those, it'd be a good idea to make a mod out of.  The conflicts in the data section under the Data tab are just plugin conflicts. It means that you have two mods that have the same exact esp or esm. This is most likely caused by compatibility patches that you have installed. As long as your compatibility patches are sorted correctly in the left pane (loose files), it will be fine. If I have a compatibility patch that overwrites the original plugins, I generally try to disable the original plugin files by moving them to the optional plugins section for the plugin. I still have a couple of ""conflicts"" myself though."
FalloutMods,3bnjfd,Corporal_Klinger,2,Tue Jun 30 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"[edit] FNVEdit is the first place I would look -- fire it up and see where it crashes out. Simply removing a mod here and there will likely cause more errors if they rely on each other, etc.  It may be a simple order issue."
FalloutMods,3bnjfd,BeetlecatOne,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:00:48 2015 UTC,"If you run LOOT, are there any errors listed? Also what is the actual issue? Just crashing as soon as you start?"

FalloutMods,3bnjfd,CpntBrryCrnch,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:03:30 2015 UTC,"if you ctd immediately after launching it means you are missing a master.   Make sure that your bashed patch matches what you have in you LO, Then MO should tell you what you are missing. It could be something like bug fixes, which all mods require. Or, it could be that you did not properly merge your mods(like OWB, Honest Hearts bits which mods include-you would have merged and not overwritten) and so you are missing one of the merged bits."
FalloutMods,3bmimg,ulfjack,3,Tue Jun 30 12:35:28 2015 UTC,"Nevada Skies is the most popular one.  If you really like the RWL ones, you can just install the textures (I assume the clouds are textures) instead of the whole mod."

FalloutMods,3bo6i4,wareagle3000,2,Tue Jun 30 20:05:36 2015 UTC,"First, your load order is a mess. I'm guessing you had LOOT do it and you left it alone? LOOT for some reason splits up plugins from the same mod. Some examples of this would be More Perks, Alternative Repairing, and Millenia's Weapons. Keep them together and sort the DLC patches in the same order the vanilla DLCs are in. I re-aranged the esm files for you:  YUP - Base Game + All DLC.esm SomeguySeries.esm Sortomatic.esm SpeedyResources.esm IWR.esm ELECTRO-CITY - CompletedWorkorders.esm ELECTRO-CITY - Highways and Byways.esm More Traits.esm More Perks.esm More Perks for Dead Money.esm More Perks for Honest Hearts.esm More Perks for Old World Blues.esm More Perks for Companions.esm Project Nevada - Core.esm Project Nevada - Equipment.esm Project Nevada - Rebalance.esp Project Nevada - Cyberware.esp Pip-Phone.esm Brahmin Bess.esm SRDG.esm Weapons.of.the.New.Millenia.esm oHUD.esm FCOMaster.esm      I started on the esp files but it proved to be too much work. You have so many mods haha. Unfortunately, the esps are what need the most attention. You'll need to look up all of your mods again and check the description for a install/compatibility/load order section. For example, here is what FCO has:   Other ESM's  FCOMaster.esm (Main)  ---- Other mods that effect NPC's  ---- Patches for them mods found in the installer (might not always be necessary)  ---- Other mods that don't effect NPC's  ---- FCO.esp if you have a mod that is overwriting FCOMaster and want FCO to take priority.  ---- Merge Patch.esp (requires using FNVEdit, I suggested checking the esp and make any changes you want to after.)   Also, I think the problem with oHUD lies in the loose files and not in the plugin order. Here is what is recommended by the mod author:    Activate Darnified UI or any other UI overhaul mod such as MTUI. Activate Project Nevada Activate Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) Activate all other HUD altering mods (see above list). Activate One HUD (oHUD) *.    That was written in the days before MO. In MO, instead of activating them in that order you'd just sort the loose files in that order."

FalloutMods,3bmggf,DrVolzak,2,Tue Jun 30 21:55:48 2015 UTC,"I use many similar mods and don't get this issue, so maybe if you go off what I have it will work for you.   Your load order is bad. You have plugins from the same mod split up, and you have a compatibility patch for FWE in between FWE plugins. Compatibility patches always go after all mods they modify. The Blackened compatibility patch explicitly states that you must use the Paradox merger version of MMM with the patch. Be sure to read the instructions on how to use the merger. The FWE description on Nexus has a great load order guide. I based my entire load order off of it. It's too long so I'm not going to bother summarising it here. Just check it out near the bottom of the description. I recommend you not only put your load order in such manner, but also your loose files. Don't use the FOIP patch for MMM and FWE; you already have the Blackened patch that is more up-to-date and does it for you. However, you can keep FOIP for WMK I don't see a compatibility patch between DarnUI and FWE. You should get it (from FWE's page.)   If you have trouble sorting your load order, I can do it for you."

Oh well, the ""decent challenge"" depends by many factors. Anyway, particularly the last one (which has few characters not voiced, however most are), is probably the biggest content in terms of completed quest mods. The first time I played it, I didn't get it too much and I wasn't really excited. After the second run, I really took the time to get every detail and I finally understood it was definetely the best quest mod I played for NV. Technically very well done, a lot of original assets, big longevity, original characters."

FalloutMods,3bmoz4,kuddlesworth55,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:12:58 2015 UTC,I installed it manually it worked fine for me surprisingly because I thought it would be terrible and not work properly but it actually works really really well. For me though and I have a crap ton of mods so I expected it to crash all the time or just never actually work. I would give it another try because it's really worth it. Especially when you get Home Sweet Home which adds a door from NV to F3 instantly. It's like playing both games at the same time.
FalloutMods,3bmoz4,FishNeedles,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"I tried last night and tried installing it with both Nexus Mod Manager and Fallout Mod Manager. both times it said the FOMOD was corrupted and couldn't be installed. I'm going to try again tonight after re-installing Fallout 3.   I think the big problem is that I did something to Fallout 3 when I was young and stupid, because I can't ever get it to actually play with any kind of mods. If it's a fresh install with no mods it'll work, but the second I try installing even something as simple as a weapon mod the whole thing gets screwed up so badly it won't work again until I re-install completely."
FalloutMods,3bmoz4,rocktheprovince,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:42:44 2015 UTC,I had all those mods installed when I installed TTW it really shouldn't be a problem. They were all installed on NV though not F3. F3 needs to be unmodded.

FalloutMods,3bn9p9,YoureAllRobots,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:15:14 2015 UTC,"Try to keep the plugins of a mod together. You have EVE sitting in between TTW. Try moving it either before TTW, or after (but not after the EVE TTW patch.)   Judging by how many TTW plugins there are, there should be a load order guide somewhere. I looked on TTW's website and all they have for a load order is how to organise the vanilla plugins and then they put one TTW plugin at the bottom. You obviously have more than one. I'm not too familiar with TTW. Are the plugins addons to the main mod from other authors?   You can try deleting your INI files. The run the launcher once to regenerate them and set your graphics settings. You can then apply the multithread fixes. There isn't much else you can do to your INI files. Mostly just graphical improvements."
FalloutMods,3bn9p9,DrVolzak,2,Tue Jun 30 21:54:02 2015 UTC,"Good eyes, that makes sense.  I also changed my install order to mirror the LOOT load order so maybe that will fix the other stuff, too.  Thanks man."
FalloutMods,3bn9p9,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:09:05 2015 UTC,"I've heard lots of people complain that TTWOptions.esp caused their load times to shoot through the roof. I can't confirm or deny, though: I tried using it once, but because of a bug in MCM (you can't scroll the mod list when you have a mod menu opened), I couldn't actually access its submenus, so I turned it off before doing much with it. You might try disabling that and seeing if it helps.  Your twice nightly crashes are very likely a result of the number of visual mods you've got running. I'd suggest scaling down to a smaller version of NMC. Actually, I'd suggest turning it off entirely and playing for a while first to see if it helps with the crashes."

My TTW save is at 8 mb at 16 hours in, my modded NV saves are at 5 and 6.5 at 5 and 15 hours respectively.  It's only the consoles that suffer from save game bloat."
FalloutMods,3bmxib,NukaCooler,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:08:43 2015 UTC,However I am at 3.5 hours in... Also is there really nothing wrong with game save files being large for PC? I know that was a big thing on consoles.
FalloutMods,3bmxib,SPOOFE,2,Tue Jun 30 16:01:45 2015 UTC,"If you start getting crashes after a good chunk a time into the game, one trick is to go to a safe indoor location (like your house in Megaton) and wait a week. If you have any survival needs mods, feel free to turn 'em off. Going into an interior cell (no outside cells are loaded) and that amount of in-game time will trigger clean-up of the map, and the mutilated remains of your fallen foes from 40 hours back won't be hogging resources no more.  This is not a comprehensive solution for all instabilities, only for instances in which the game is trying to track too much stuff at once."
FalloutMods,3bmxib,WildfireDarkstar,2,Tue Jun 30 18:59:35 2015 UTC,"Save bloat is a major issue with Skyrim because of how the game handles scripts (they get embedded into the save file). New Vegas doesn't do it the same way, so save bloat is a much less serious issue there. It can still happen, but I've never seen it utterly destroy games in the same way that Skyrim does, just increase load times."
FalloutMods,3bmxib,FishNeedles,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:12:46 2015 UTC,They get pretty damn big by the end of your playthrough and load times may get a bit longer.  I have about 190-200 mods running.

The best way to find out which mod is screwing with you is to disable all mods and re-enable them one by one. If it crashes with no mods enabled then your game files are fucked and you'll need to reverify them.
FalloutMods,3bm6b1,Omega_Chris,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:38:12 2015 UTC,There are some mods where loot cannot put in order sometimes and this time is one of the mods that has to be very specific. Basically you have to find out which mod is precise on its load order.
FalloutMods,3bm6b1,DrVolzak,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:55:28 2015 UTC,"If I were to unload all mods, does anybody have a suggestion of in which order the mods should be installed?"
FalloutMods,3bm6b1,Iziama94,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:53:30 2015 UTC,"First, make sure you have all the compatibility patches you need between mods. Also, I still think it's something to do with the load order. LOOT will not do a perfect job. You didn't post what LOOT did, but based off your original load order, I see FCO needs to go at the bottom of your masters. Here is what the author recommends:   Other ESM's  FCOMaster.esm (Main)  ---- Other mods that effect NPC's  ---- Patches for them mods found in the installer (might not always be necessary)  ---- Other mods that don't effect NPC's  ---- FCO.esp if you have a mod that is overwriting FCOMaster and want FCO to take priority.  ---- Merge Patch.esp (requires using FNVEdit, I suggested checking the esp and make any changes you want to after.)   Also, Electro City has a petty comprehensive load order guide in the readme:   FALLOUTNV.ESM  CINEMATECH.ESM  [INCREASED WASTELAND SPAWNS CORE1  rePOPULATED WASTELAND.ESM  WARZONES : Misanthropy Pure.ESM  ELECTRO-CITY - Completed Workorders.ESM  ELECTRO-CITY - Highways and Byways.ESM*  [NEW VEGAS REDESIGNED.ESM1******  [TIMESCALE ADJUSTER***  LUMENARIUM – WorkingSunglassesOnly.esp  ELECTRO-CITY - Inventory Sorters Patch.esp**  [NEVADA SKIES - URWLified**** or NEVADA SKIES****  [URWL, FELLOUT or Weather Mod*****  ELECTRO-CITY - Darker Nights.esp*  LUMENARIUM - Bright Clear Days.esp  [INTERIOR LIGHTING OVERHAUL1  [CUSTOM LIGHTING OVERLAY1  DYNAVISION2 - Dynamic Lens Effect.esp  ELECTRO-CITY – IMAGINATOR.esp   1 Not my mod  *OPTIONAL ELECTRO-CITY MOD.

Please read the README included in that package.  *** You do NOT need a Timescale Adjuster to make any of my mods work.  **** Optional, but highly recommended WEATHER mod.  Choose ONE version.

Because ECITY and WZONES add new NPCs and NVREDESIGNED can adjust them to look better than Vanilla.  If you’re seeing textures that don’t match on the Head and Neck then you’ve done something wrong.  There is much said about this error on the ‘net so I won’t repeat it here.    Also, I find it odd that MCM is at the bottom. If any mod that needs MCM loads before it, wont that cause issues?"
FalloutMods,3blse2,yescalculators,2,Tue Jun 30 06:42:59 2015 UTC,You need a compatibility patch for EVE and RH_Ironsights to work together.

The profile directory is the only INI files the game will use when launching through MO.  My recommendation is to delete the INI files in the profile folder, open MO, and launch the Fallout launcher. It will generate new files and then you can set your resolution through the launcher's options menu. Afterwards you will probably never need the launcher again and can try loading NVSE through MO."

My ENB (Nevada ENB - Realism) is not working with Mod Organizer. If I launch it through MO, the game instantly crashes, but if I launch through the 4GB launcher in my FNV root folder, it loads the game and the ENB just fine, but not my MO mods, because to have your MO mods, you need to launch through MO. Thoughts? I already placed the dlls in the exe folder created by the 4GB Patch."
FalloutMods,3bl9nm,DrVolzak,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:33:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's no problem. I am not too familiar with NV's 4GB patcher. I'm playing FO3 at the moment so I can only share what I know from that. I don't know what you meant by    I already placed the dlls in the exe folder created by the 4GB Patch.   It creates a separate folder? Please elaborate. The ENB files should be in the same place as NVSE/FalloutNV.exe.   Which ENB are you using? The wrapper or the injector. I believe one is an executable that you run to inject ENB into your game. I don't think this will work since you still need to launch NVSE (which I doubt it auto detects) and MO doesn't support launching two executables at once.  Use the wrapper version. The d3d9.dll is the important file and needs to be with NVSE etc. Also, make sure you have the latest ENB libraries .267. The way I install ENB is by installing the mod/preset first and then dragging the ENB vanilla files in, selecting to not overwrite any files. I also make a mod out of the data folder than most ENBs come with and install it into MO rather than dragging them into the root folder. The data folder usually has bugfixes for graphical glitches that happen with ENB such as with hair and include lighting adjustments.  Another possibility for the crash might be something in enblocal.ini, but I doubt it since the game does work without MO."
FalloutMods,3bl9nm,DrVolzak,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:43:25 2015 UTC,"FNV 4GB allows the game to use more than the default of 2 gbs of RAM, which is extremely important for large resolution texture packs and stuff like that. Because of the way it works (I don't know how to elaborate on how it works, not sure), the only exe it autoruns when you launch it is NVSE, and the ENB dlls count as exes as well for some reason. To fix this, it creates a folder called exes in the root FNV folder, and then you can put ENB dll's in there. Theoretically, it should just work, and it does without mod organizer, but when I launch it through MO (and I need to to have my mods enabled), but something is causing the game to CTD on startup when opened with MO. If you don't know how to fix this, I might just delete this thread and create another one for more exposure. Thanks for the help!"

No crashes. I'm going to take a guess at what the issue is. The 4GB patch says this:   If you want to use an ENB, SweetFX, or FXAA Injector you need to add the following launch options to the shortcut ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout New Vegas\FNV4GB.exe"" -laaexe .\FalloutNV4GB.exe   I'm guessing you didn't do this? In MO, this can be done by editing the shortcut and adding    -laaexe .\FalloutNV4GB.exe   to the arguments section. Be sure to click modify before closing that window.  I also have every executable I could find set to run as admin and I have the game installed to C:\Games instead of the Steam directory, which is in C:\program files and is known to cause issues. If the previous information didn't work try this as a last resort."
FalloutMods,3bl9nm,Stealth_Commando,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:13:20 2015 UTC,"The game continues to crash, even after adding the argument. I think I'm just gonna start over with a fresh install tomorrow, because I did a lot of adding and removing files trying to get the ENB to work, and I might have done stuff wrong along the way. I'll probably also just use NMM this time, too, because it seems like MO is causing more problems than its fixing. Thanks so much for all the help!"
FalloutMods,3bl9nm,DrVolzak,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:27:37 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate that you're going back to NMM. Oh well, good luck to you. If you're going to reinstall, my suggestion for C:\ still stands.   Oh, did you also see the comment about using the injector version of ENB? Try that.  Edit: Just to make sure, you're using this 4GB patcher, right? I don't see any exe folder like you said it makes. Not in my root directory or in the overwrite of MO. Is it just a temporary folder while the game is running?"

FalloutMods,3bkyz8,DrVolzak,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:11:39 2015 UTC,The high res eye pack should fix that problem I believe. Don't quote me on that though....  http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/37537/?

Worl of Pain npcs (ones with collars) are supposed to self destruct upon death to destroy their loot making the early game more balanced. Eve fucks with the self destruct and just makes them disintegrate. So no problem and only collar WOP npcs are affected.
FalloutMods,3bldev,kelson448,2,Tue Jun 30 04:01:46 2015 UTC,"Try loading MCM before PN. Also, try sort the PN DLC plugins in the same order the game's DLC plugins are.   Your INI files may have something changed in them that's causing a crash. Try deleting them and then running the Fallout Launcher to regenerate them and set your graphics.  Try setting NVSE and fallout exe to run as admin. As a last resort, reinstall your game outside of C:\Program Files. Somewhere to C:\, like C:\Games"

FalloutMods,3bihkp,CongBroChill17,2,Mon Jun 29 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe. Complete whatever quests you are on (as able), go to an inside location, preferably by yourself, and make sure to clean save. You may get away with no to few issues. Generally speaking you want to avoid removing mods during a play through, especially when its scripted. The way scripts work in New Vegas you get more leeway with removal than you do in Skyrim, but still it should be avoided at all costs. If you aren't far into the save I would restart."

I haven't heard of anything like that, but maybe these other cinematic mods might interest you:   Dynavision Cinematech Imaginator Director's Chair ENB + a preset   These are all for Fallout 3 but I'm pretty confident versions of these exist for NV if that's what you're after.  Also, there are some in-game commands you can use (taken from the wiki):   tfc - toggle free camera; lets you move around the camera at will. To take pictures of your character, make sure you go into third-person mode first. Typing tfc 1 will pause the game, while still allowing you to move the camera around in the game. tm - toggle menus; removes the HUD for even nicer pictures. It will also hide the notification you normally get when the screenshot has been successfully captured, but it will take the shot. If you use tm soon enough after taking the screenshot, you can see the notification. sucsm 10, fast, sucsm 1, slow moving camera in tfc. fov 40, narrow, fov 90, wide angle lens. fov 75, default lens. tlb - toggle lightbrite mode makes everything well lit, great for dark spots."

Are you using the injector or hook version of ENB? Does NVSE load? Type GetNVSEVersion (case sensitive) in the console and see if it returns a value.

If you want, you can open FO3Edit and compare random records between the compatibility patch and the merged patch and see if there are any conflicts. If there are, you should probably redo the patch and include the compatibility patch.  From my experience, I use FO3Edit to make a merged patch and I leave compatibility patches checked. My game runs fine besides the FPS drops, which I don't think has anything to do with a merged patch.

FalloutMods,3bhmf3,Sessine,2,Mon Jun 29 12:42:44 2015 UTC,"I am thoroughly enjoying Tale of Two Wastelands, and encourage you to do the same. Installation is very dependent on Fallout Mod Manager, if I remember correctly.  If you do go forward with TTW - get NVAC New Vegas Anti Crash first and foremost, as TTW has some stability issues otherwise.  Classic Fallout Weapons - Tale of Two Wastelands is a must have mod for me for TTW. The mod team behind TTW removed all instances of .32 caliber ammo and all dependent weapons from the game, a decision I consider very counterproductive in terms of weapon diversity and balance. CFW reintroduces the ammo and weapons - as it should be. It also adds a ton of other ammos and weapons to the game, so it has an additional benefit.  TTW Immersive Armors and Weapons adds another slew of weapons to the game, and it comes with even more armors. Some of the armors had texture issues, so run Archive Invalidation File Generator.  Weapons of the New Millenia - TTW also adds a slew of weapons to the game. Be advised, WotNM - TTW adds weapons that are duplicated with (predominantly) CFW - TTW. So, if you're ok having two  separate AK-47's, then install both and game on.  Metro Carriage Interiors adds interior cells to all metro cars in the subway. Many are littered with skeletons and junk, but occasionally you find something interesting in one, perhaps even with a story to it. I really encourage this mod.  EVE TTW is awesome also. It adds more energy weapons to the game, and creates a slew of new death animations. Particularly energy and explosion kills. Very worth it.  That's a great start, in my opinion. I hope you check out TTW - it is worth the try."

Watch Gopher's amazing videos on MO. He not only shows you how to use it, but tells you what's so special about it over NMM and what its features are. I believe he has a series both for Skryim and NV."

FalloutMods,3bhe04,kuddlesworth55,2,Tue Jun 30 14:30:29 2015 UTC,11.6MB still with no crashes. That is about 20 hours I think. Also the game will slow down so it takes time to open up storage containers and such. Also it freezes when I fire my double barrel shotgun sometimes. If I reload a save it fixes it though.
FalloutMods,3bhe04,kuddlesworth55,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:49:24 2015 UTC,Has the game slowed down from the beginning with containers out in the open world? Just making sure because it sometimes slows down the container stuff for me too. Saving then reloading works for me as well.
FalloutMods,3bhe04,kuddlesworth55,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:48:15 2015 UTC,"Yea after about 1 hour or so of game time containers slow down and stuff. I quick save and load it back up, no need to restart PC or game. Still no crashes which is outstanding. Oh and it's way more than 20 hours more like 100 in the past 2 weeks. And I work full time which is like what I did when the game first came out. TTW revived the games for me. Loot and FNVEdit also revived the nostalgia now the game works properly."

FalloutMods,3bgxqx,CloneTwo7,2,Mon Jun 29 03:23:22 2015 UTC,"As long as you're not into modifying your game past the point of recognition, I'd recommend the TTW versions of WMX, YUP, JSawyer, and Fellout, the FNV versions of CASM, NVAC, NV Enhanced Camera, Precision Collision (make sure you delete the mesh for the pool triangle, you can google it), Some Things Cannot be Eaten, Zan's Crash Protector, and OneTweak.  Those mods are pretty much all just things that tweak the gameplay experience to ""fix"" it, and IMO improve the experience. As a baseline, you'd better install MCM and NVSE ASAP."

FalloutMods,3bfo91,sorenant,6,Sun Jun 28 20:26:50 2015 UTC,"Play it on Hard Hardcore, that's what JSawyer himself recommends. Snealing is absolutely necessare in early game, late game feels pretty much just like vanilla late game, you can still get incredibly overpowered. I've played with YUP, WMX/WME and PN, and the balance is pretty much kept. You'll need to either make a manual patch or tweak the settings if you use the PN Rebalance module, as bashed patches will combine the levelled lists, meaning that you'll actually get more stims that before Jsawyer (because you get the settings from PN + Jsawyer's expired stims). Jsawyer also tweaks some weapons and ingestibles, so load it after any other mod, mark it as Bash: Stats while keeping your WMX as bash: Weapon Mods"

I wish I knew how to make my own texture; it would have made it look much better. The hat is also too shiny under light. I'll see what I can do about that as well.  I have no clue why it's crashing.

If you're familiar with the GECK, you could try making the Playerfaction an enemy of every other faction, which will make them shoot you on sight once in game. After that, it's a matter of swapping out creatures for the ones you want, changing weapons and clothing of NPCs (to reflect the desolation of the ""DUST"" world""), and tweaking loot spawns to ensure you get very little ammunition and meds."

The Pentagon could probably be controlled by some big mercenary group as well. Something else that could also be done is taking the idea of cannibals from Dust and implementing them into this one, though. Having some camps strewn about and maybe a settlement or two for them. Outside of that, though, settlements like Megaton and Canterbury would have to be dealt with. Paradise Falls will probably shoot you on sight, Underworld might as well maybe. Big Town might also shoot on sight, though they will probably not have the means to insta-gib the player like other towns would."

I haven't actually tried to learn scripting for the older titles, but I think that such little houses would be much better off as an 'unmarked quest' of sorts. In FO3 especially its one of the things most missing.   Even an extremely simplified version of something like the New Bison Steve would be incredibly nice. Say something like you come upon 2 raiders and guy fighting (the guy being the previous owner of the house), have the raiders kill the guy, you kill the raiders, and find a set of notes on the guy of where he is going to go scavenge some nice bits. Like say the workbench is found in the Corvega showroom, and the autodoc at the Robco offices. Something along those lines.

You can also clean mods. However, keep in mind that some mods explicitly state to not clean them (and maybe there are some that shouldn't be cleaned but the author doesn't let us know.)   There are definitely videos out there on how to clean masters. Probably not for FNVEdit, but the process is identical across Bethesda's engine. Most tutorials will be for TESEdit/Skyrim.

FalloutMods,3bg22v,IAMPOUNDCAKE,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:50:22 2015 UTC,That isn't entirely accurate. Some of the very old presets have detrimental effects on newer binaries because somewhere around .150 the binary was completely rewritten. Since then some of the 'bugfixing' can also cause issues with things like shadows. Much of that also depends on how much of the preset is 'custom code' versus just changing settings.

FO3 stuff can be used once you have patched it yourself, with the rather easy to follow guide there to help with most of it. Not everything will be easy to convert, but most of the tougher to convert mods tend to have better/similar options available in NV already.   You want to be especially careful modding TTW due to the very low plugin limit (~140) and once you get staples like better interior lighting, more interiors, weather modifications, combat overhauls, NPC makeovers, etc, you don't have much room to really add too much. As it is, about the only thing from FO3 that I am really missing is the alternative fast travel system from FWE. There is a TTW version of the Mobile Truck Base, but its not quite the same."

But even then, you are looking at 12 plugins just for both games and the TTW patch, add another 4 for the pre order packs (if you use them, I do not) and up to 6 depending on what optional 'beta' esp's you are using from TTW itself. Then you have another 4 for basic utilities (CASM, Stutter Remover, Darn UI, UIO). Plug ins add up rather quick."

Weapon Mod Recipes can be used with vanilla, WMX, or PN+WMX. Adds crafting recipes for all weapon mods.  Ammo Crafting Schematics adds schematics that give you the recipes for each type of ammo when you find them.  Dust maybe isn't technically underrated but it doesn't get brought up nearly enough. If you want a hardcore survival game with changes to the story and environment, this is your shit right here. Amazing.   AG Supplementary Uniques is another that gets skipped over too much IMO. It adds tons of cool, hidden unique weapons to the game. They're all very interesting.   Better Breaching is way cooler than Project Nevada's explosive breaching option. It adds more ways to break through locks including shotgun shells made for beaching wooden door locks. Very cool and immersive.  Combat Enhancer is probably the last remaining combat AI mod that actually seems to work the way it was intended to. And it works very well. Enemies take cover a lot more often and generally act a lot smarter. I stumbled on it totally by accident and have never seen it mentioned here.  Gun Behavior Mod Merge is awesome. If you like the mods that make guns more realistic (manual reloading and real visual recoil for example) then this is perfect. Merges all the popular gunplay tweaks and makes them configurable in MCM.  Textures Over Time is gorgeous but doesn't change a ton of textures so it isn't often mentioned. The things it does change are common and very noticeable though.  Those are just off the top of my head. By the way OP, check out Signature Weapons - Balanced if you feel like the original is too overpowered. I hugely prefer it. Just slightly tweaks the values for all of the effects to be less ridiculous."

FalloutMods,3bckzi,rocktheprovince,3,Sun Jun 28 01:43:36 2015 UTC,It does! But you have to make some breaching shells at a reloading bench. Then you switch to that ammo type in your shotty of choice and then activate the door while sneaking. You'll fire a shell and you have a chance of breaking the lock. It only works on wooden doors so it is fairly realistic.  I'm a huge fan of that mod. It also adds other methods like I said.

Mobile Truck Base or the XRE version of Winnebago for no-fast-travel playthroughs.  Endless Warfare for all kinds of reasons. I am currently using it in place of IWS to turn my game into a zombie apocalypse. It has the best and most stable zombie features in any mod around if you configure it right. I've tried them all!  Tailor Maid for all your fashion needs outside of Spice of Life.  The Groovatron and all related mods for taking awesome screenshots. It's a little hard to utilize at first which is why a lot of people don't use it, but it raises the bar from 'pretty screenshots' to being able to tell a story in a picture.   Remote Control Companions is now my go-to companion mod. It has all the functionality of a bunch of other mods put together (home markers, actor status, set and lock specific gear, warp companions to you, change fighting style or edit stats, and more). I use it in place of JIP command and control but they are functional together as long as you don't give companions conflicting orders.   Digital Nightmare for a more serious, dark, and metal soundtrack.   Ladder Restoration Project has saved my ass so many times in DUST and zombie playthroughs.   Goodsprings, Novac, and Primm reborn to pump some life into the early-game. Primm reborn is especially cool and makes the conflict between the convicts and NCR feel really threatening.

How you go about making that choice is up to you. In the case of textures, installing a third party program like Gimp 2, or just loading up the game in between installations to see if you like the new textures or not. All of them come with pro's and con's. For example, just because a texture looks good in a program like Gimp, doesn't mean that it will 'fit' with the rest of the game.

I'm assuming you have the WMX and EVE patches from Project Nevada (I can't tell since they are only loose files.) Just go through a lot of the bigger mods; they tend to have compatibility patches among them.  Usually crashes that happen right away are related to your load order. I wouldn't expect FNVEdit to load everything in this case, but I don't have too much experience with load order crashes so I never had the opportunity to test that out. Not 100% sure if successfully loading it in FNVEdit means that load order isn't an issue."
FalloutMods,3beoqr,DrVolzak,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:49:18 2015 UTC,I think I installed all compatibility patches(I was missing a couple but what do you expect when you're installing over 100 mods at once) now but still the same thing happens.

FalloutMods,3beoqr,DrVolzak,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:23:11 2015 UTC,"I would think so, but like I said, I don't know for sure. Maybe there are certain load order issues that they can't detect.

FalloutMods,3bei32,dubyawinfrey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:05:44 2015 UTC,It might be Marts Mutant Mod. I had a problem with a different mutant mod that crashed the game near Megaton. You should use LOOT though to clear up any mod list conflicts. Also you should make the game run on only 2 cores no more otherwise the game is unstable. Turn off threading also as this will also do the same. Just stick with the 2 cores and 4GB launcher. I have about 150 mods installed and I have only crashed once and I have completed the game. You will need to restart the game about every few hours or so though to make the game run optimally.

FalloutMods,3bdqzn,theltrtduck,3,Sun Jun 28 06:45:10 2015 UTC,"Usually a crash that happens as soon as you load the game is related to load order. I think it's because you unchecked certain mods. I never used Wyre for merged patches, always FO3Edit, so I don't know why it told you to un-check those mods and if it account for them. Some issues I see:   You have the Broken Steel DLC but do not have the Fellout, Project Beauty, and RH Ironsights Broken Steel plugins activated. You have the Point Lookout DLC, but you do not have the Project Beauty Point Lookout plugin activated. You have the Anchorage DLC, but you do not have the RH Ironsights and Fellout Anchorage plugins activated, You have MMM, but you do not have the DC Interiors MMM compatibility patch activated.  You seem to have some compatibility patches between FWE and Project Beauty disabled You have Darn UI, FWE, EVE, MMM, RH_Ironsights, and WMK, but do not seem to have the adequate compatibility patches for all of those mods. I will go into more detail later. RH_Ironsights doesn't have the vanilla plugin activated. I assume this is a requirement for the mod to work.   So, you have a bunch of big mods as mentioned earlier. They all need compatibility patches. For starters, check out Paradox Mergers. You mainly need the MMM and RH_Ironsights merged versions. They will be required for the compatibility patches. However, I'd recommend getting merged versions for any other mods you're using, which I believe would be just Fellout.  Blackened is the main compatibility patch. You will want to get the Blackened FWE - MMM - EVE - Project Beauty and Blackened RH_Ironsights - FWE - EVE files.  DarnifiedUI also needs a compatibility patch with FWE, found under the optional files for FWE (or click here.)  Please read the descriptions/ReadMes carefully for the mergers and patches. For example, some important information for the mergers is that you need to delete the original plugins for the mods but leave all the assets (what I did in Mod Organiser is just drag the plugins to the optional section.) I'm not going to cover everything here.  Once you have these patches installed, you'll probably have to remake the merged patch. In FO3Edit I don't uncheck any plugins afterwards. I just load in all the plugins I want and then make the patch and plop it at the end of the load order. I recommend reading the load order recommendations for the patches, but LOOT does such a good job that you shouldn't have to concern yourself too much with that. Just double check LOOT's work afterwards. Also, be sure the merged patch stays at the bottom. LOOT likes to put my merged patch a bit higher up."

You might want to grab the RH_Ironsights merger as well while you're at it, though I think MMM is the only one that's required."

The only other thing that isn't much of a problem is that my custom perks seem to repeat themselves twice in the perk list instead of showing up only once.

FalloutMods,3be9d6,DrVolzak,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:06:20 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the perks would be a compatibility with FWE as well.

FalloutMods,3bduvv,awesomeness243,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:48:42 2015 UTC,"Although I don't think we'll be seeing them any time soon at all, yes I think Playstation will get mods.   With their biggest competitions now both having mods (PC & Xbox) they've left themselves at a real disadvantage when someone wants to buy a new console and is weighing up the pros and cons. Its the first thing between the console rivalry that has substantial merit. Before now, each side has had enough exclusive pros that you could easily argue for either side but you can't argue with ""My game has potentially more content and a longer shelf life than your version"".   So although I don't expect it to happen for the release of Fallout, I strongly believe it will happen at some point which means you'll still get to come back to Fallout 4 and re-enjoy it with mods, you'll just have to be patient."

Also try right-clicking the NV install folder > security > advanced > change (top left next to owner) > type in ""everyone"" (no quotes) > check names > ok > tick both check boxes > ok > ok to any prompts during the process  These do make a difference on Windows 8.1.

Open the launcher once so that the INI files can be remade and so that you can set your graphics options. Then go back to running you game the normal way and see if MCM works.  Also try running the game with barebones. Only have the base game, NVSE, MCM, and a single mod that uses MCM installed.  Try the above with the ""clean"" INI files and with a new save. Perhaps you could try your current mod setup with a new save as well.  As a last and tedious resort, try uninstalling all of the VC packages you have and the reinstalling them perhaps?"

You will need to upgrade to version 1.1 for your Mod Configuration Menu to work correctly.""  I am using the most up-to-date versions of both mods, so clearly what it says isn't the problem.

FalloutMods,3bd81y,edthefreak,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:08:15 2015 UTC,"So you probably (it's a popular mod) had PN installed. It installs an older version of MCM. Maybe it somehow messed up the game even though it's uninstalled?   Not sure if you've done this but: uninstall the game completely. Don't even leave anything in the My Games folder. Backup whatever you see fit. Then, install the game (to C:/), run the launcher once. Get NVSE, MCM, and iHUD. No DarnUI or UIO. No 4GB patch, cleaned masters, or anything else. Don't use a mod manager; install the files manually. Just those three mods. Disable firewall and antivirus completely (you might want to disconnect from the internet during this for safety.) Run the game as admin and start a new game.  Sorry if this is repetitive. Just a complete step by step to my desperate suggestion."

Have you tried running LOOT?  Secondly, this might also seem obvious, but do you have NVSE installed correctly? MCM will not function without it. It is not installed like a normal mod, the files go in the main folder rather than the data folder. You also have to launch with NVSE or a launcher that recognizes it like 4GB loader.   One way to at least narrow down your problem would be to deactivate all mods that require MCM except for one. If there's any change then you can be sure it's some kind of incompatibility.   If all else fails and no one here can help, this is the 'support' page, in case you were only checking the normal posts.

Install the game to a directory that Windows will not restrict access to such as C:\ with optional folders. I have mine in C:\Games\steamapps\common\Fallout 3 goty. Program Files has security permission issues, even if you think you've disabled UAC. Delete your INI files and let the game regenerate them. Try running the game without directly editing the INIs (so you can still change graphics in the launcher/in-game.) Run the game with barebones mods. Just NVSE, MCM, and a single mod that makes use of MCM. If it shows up, keep adding in more mods until something goes wrong and you can single out the problematic mod(s)."

It's actually quite a bit harder than Requiem.   Compatibility isn't as big of a deal with this mod, but learning the mechanics and how to deal with all the new features is pretty challenging. Some find it more aggravating than fun because of how long it takes to get used to. There's no fast travel, realistic weapon and armor thresholds, completely revamped medicine and drug mechanics, eating/sleeping/drinking is harder, all supplies are scarce, there is burn damage, bacteria and a bunch of other new factors to consider, etc.  This is for pretty hardcore roleplaying. Can't emphasize that enough lol.  Other than that it'll take combining and tweaking a slew of mods.

We don't know. Todd Howard stated they didn't intend to release the creation kit until the first part of 2016, so it will be months before we get a chance to see exactly what kind of capabilities it has.  I do hope the new GECK will have a more intuitive design, and be more stable."

Other than that, survival and strategy mods are the kind of thing I'd like to make, although at least some of that will already be built-in, with the settlements we're able to create and defend.  As for the GECK... the old CK was a bit clunky, but it could make just about everything that's possible in the Creation engine. Improved UI would be nice, but I just hope they don't make it less capable in any way.

If Papyrus isn't being used for some reason or there are drastic changes, then I will have to wait until GECK is released before working on tools for scripting.

In Dust's case, it very specifically uses the Tunnelers from Lonesome Road and the Cloud, alongside probably at least the animations for the Ghosts, from Dead Money. But even if you could get just those assets that it uses, Dust is a very comprehensive mod. It changes most of the DLC areas, and the one that isn't changed yet just isn't done yet. If you try running it without the required DLCs, the mod's going to be referencing and modifying things that don't exist, which is going to cause the game to crash on the title screen.

FalloutMods,3bc91o,Just_Give_Me_A_Login,2,Sat Jun 27 21:48:29 2015 UTC,"FO3 mods have been ported, usually by the authors of the originals. The Groovatron and all the pose packs are one example."

If you want his gear I'd say just use the console, otherwise completely uninstall the DLC and reinstall it and see if that works.   If you're using steam, you should also right-click on Fallout 3 and go to option/properties.

FalloutMods,3b8m8k,Haji101,8,Fri Jun 26 21:17:45 2015 UTC,"Not all that surprising; they can't produce a million Texture Packs to make the Game look as pretty as it can be on all the different machines. New Texture Pack has Textures with higher Resolutions, big whoop.  Not to diminish the Work that went into those but ultimately it won't change your Game much.  I figure he was really astonished with the ""Real Time Settler"" Mods which have you build up a Settlement, so much so that they copied it into the new Game. They even got the Shanty Town look RTS went for...  Other Things that probably impressed include Project Nevada. I can't determine how much of that went into the new Game but apparently we can equip Grenades independently from other Weapons."
FalloutMods,3b8m8k,Madenmann,3,Fri Jun 26 23:25:04 2015 UTC,"New Texture Pack has Textures with higher Resolutions, big whoop.   I don't get what this is about. Yeah not everyone thinks textures are the most important thing ever, but 'big whoop' is a huge understatement. Those aren't just really easy to do like making a goodsprings house or something."
FalloutMods,3b8m8k,rocktheprovince,2,Sat Jun 27 03:46:27 2015 UTC,"High Resolution Textures can be a lot of Work but the Idea isn't exactly new. Not much of a ""creative Spark"" and not much to be done that makes the Bethesda People think ""Wow, how is that even possible!"".  Where as something like Real Time Settler obviously gave them Pause and influenced them. Here we have a Mod that does Things that no one, including Bethesda apparently, thought where possible.  I figure some People will come up with some Idea to make the voiced player character work with Quests mod and maybe it will be something better then a silent Protagonist; if that happens you can be sure Bethesda will take Note because that is something the entire Video Game Industry has been unable to do.  A House in Starting-ville isn't a very new Idea as well. The Most Struggle you might have with that is with the Balance and not loading your Character down with super awesome Weapons.  There will be a House in ""Sanctuary Hills"" which seems to be the starting Town, i myself might re-arrange the Character's House, which was apparently guarded by Codsworth. I would put some random Clothes into the Drawers because he or she would have some Clothes and they won't be going anywhere by themselves.  No Armor, because why would they have Armor around and maybe one Pistol, which would then be the shittiest pistol in the Game.  But there's no fascinating creative Spark happening here.  Now if you where to make a low res Texture Pack that somehow looks better, through carefully applied optical Illusions or Something. Something that i can't even think of, if i could it wouldn't be new. If you where to manage that you can be sure Bethesda would take Note of that and look very closely at how you made your low res Textures look better."
FalloutMods,3b8m8k,Madenmann,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:28:12 2015 UTC,"make the voiced player character work with Quests mod and maybe it will be something better then a silent Protagonist   It'll be plausible to reuse some more generic dialog from the main character. You can kindof cheese your way through dialog with the player character saying things like ""What do you want?"" ""That sounds alright."" ""No, I'd rather not do that."" ""You make a good point."" ""Could you tell me more?"" ""I'm not so sure..."" ""You're out of your mind."" ""I don't think that's how it works.""  I think Mass Effect and some other voiced protagonist games noticeably does this for some quests, just so they could add more quest content without recording more dialog for the player character. No doubt many of the Fallout 4 quests will do this already."
FalloutMods,3b8m8k,GSlayerBrian,-1,Sat Jun 27 14:33:42 2015 UTC,"Project Nevada was made by the same group that did Fallout Wanderers Edition for Fallout 3, and a lot of their ideas were officially incorporated into New Vegas.

But in the end they don't change a lot - they just ""polish"" the game a little.  Gameplay mods on the other hand - some of them really change the whole game. I love those. Can't get enough of them. I still find mods and think ""wow, that's awesome"" (though I generally tend to stay away from mods that change too many things at a time).  And I love editing shit in Geck. You want the Sniper Rifle Stats on a .44 Magnum? Or wear reading glasses with power armor stats? New perks?  I even edited VATS to be more long range friendly because I felt it should be my characters skill deciding what I can hit and not my aim.  Absolutely awesome.

FalloutMods,3b9gm6,Silentviper92,2,Sat Jun 27 01:52:00 2015 UTC,"I had similar problems and did a clean install. There's just a ton unrelated things that can lead to crashes. For example: I played hours with the Interior Lighting Overhaul. No problems. Then entering the Sunset Sarsparilla factory, crash. Reload, crash - until I deactivated the mod.  Some bigger Texture mods gave me huge memory problems and sometimes it's a mod that works beautifully for seemingly everybody else on the planet - but crashes the game for me.  A lot of crashes came from the auto quick save when zoning (or at least at the same time), that one can be avoided with CASM. Stutter remover is known to fix some issues. 4GBNV helps, windowed fullscreen mode may help. I know there are some ""crash fixers"" but I have no experience with them."
FalloutMods,3b9gm6,Heyne,2,Sat Jun 27 03:10:55 2015 UTC,What mod manager are you using? If you are using NMC it could be due to the fact that saves your mods directly to your game folder.

It's hard to figure out what the problem is without knowing your specific mod order. One thing you can try right now is downloading and running LOOT. It's a mod sorter that will automatically take care of any issues you have as far as mods being run in a suboptimal order.   If you're having CTD at startup, which I assume is what you mean by crashing, its possible it's a result of mods not being run in the correct order. If a mod depends on another mod to function, the parent mod must be above the first one in the list."

FalloutMods,3b7927,Stealth_Commando,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:57:29 2015 UTC,My understanding is the limit is 145.  NMM says I've got 112.  Also FNVEdit will tell you if you've passed the limit but when I run it it doesn't say that and it finishes loading everything fine.  Besides like I said it was working yesterday and I didn't change my load order so I really don't think that's it.

FalloutMods,3b6d02,IAMPOUNDCAKE,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:55:22 2015 UTC,"This is a really complex question since it depends on what you mean by 'work together'. If you mean crashes, then many will work together fine. If you mean ""everything from both of them' then its going to vary greatly. Some of it is due to how the game records work, some of it depends on how the mod itself is designed. For example, lets say you want to install 2 mods that effect characters. One changing how the characters look, one changing how characters behave. If the one that changes behavior just changes the AI package on the record itself, then load order will depend on which one you see in game since looks and behavior are tied to one overall record. If the mod that changes behavior is scripted though, to inject the AI package then they will be perfectly compatible. This will be entirely on you to determine, with tools like FNVedit being one of the best tools for it."

FalloutMods,3b664t,illegaljokes,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:17:31 2015 UTC,"Calm down a little. I understand your frustration, because I was trying to reinstall Fallout 3 yesterday too.   To understand why the fallout 3 modding scene is such a mess, you need to know a little about the history:  When Fallout mods were made, there were no mod managers. None. Zero. You download a mod, read the read me file in it and past the files into your game folder.   When Fallout Mod Manager was made, some developers supported it. Not everyone did though, and most of the mods released before it didn't support it.   Then Nexus Mod Manger came out. By this point the Fallout 3 mods were already mostly done. Very few mods ever gained official support for NMM. NMM was made to to be compatible with mods that supported FOMM, but it wasn't perfect. A lot of people, including me stuck to FOMM.   Do you see the issue now? You are trying to dive headlong into this mess. A lot of the mods were not made for mod managers of any kind.    Do I saw Yes to All or No to All   Complicated question, you asked. This occurs when a mod overwrite another. There is no one size fit all answer to this question. Some mods on Nexus will tell you explicitly that it should be installed after so and so mod, in which case you should install the mods in the prescribed order and choose Yes to All. If there are no explicitly instructions, you are going to have to make the decision on your own - do you want the files of this mod to overwrite the ones you have already installed?  *Edit: Just noticed that you have FONV and not FO3. Well, the modding scene was more mature by the time FONV was released, but NMM still wasn't as mainstream as it is now. I installed all of my FONV mods manually without any mod organiser."

I would try and see if making a merge patch helps (It's always best to make a merged patch when installing mods).  If that doesn't work out, it is possible that you just have a corrupted save (the games default quick saves and auto saves can sometimes break your savegame). If this is the case, try loading an earlier save and see if it still crashes where it does (theres a chance the older save may not have been corrupted yet."

FalloutMods,3b3lba,lizalot,2,Thu Jun 25 18:49:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, the order you install mods can be important in some situations.  I second lizalot's recommendation to watch Gopher's Tutorials.  They're a great starting point for moding and will help you understand the basics.  From there, you can add and remove as much as you like.  Based on the discussion in the mod's forum, it appears MTUI and Project Nevada are not compatible."
FalloutMods,3b3lba,SurlyQueue,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:05:34 2015 UTC,"I use MTUI and PN together no problem, just make sure you use UIO (User Interface Organizer) and load it after both, it basically takes the files that all the UI mods use (which usually overwrite each other) and automatically combines them, so no problems.  Just to be safe, however, I'd let PN overwrite MTUI (and make sure to load UIO last).  Also, I highly recommend Mod Organizer, because if one mod overwrites another and causes problems, you can just switch off that mod (or ""hide"" the file that is trying to overwrite) and everything will be back to normal, no mess, no fuss."

I just updated everything to be up to date with the latest versions of everything.  I'm guessing the Additional Weapons merged plugin is the culprit. Redo that one with the updated stuff and you should be good.

FalloutMods,3b2y3x,PizzStreamer,2,Thu Jun 25 15:21:00 2015 UTC,"I think that this is an issue with all enbs for fallout, because all of the effects are post processed it can only use what is in each frame. This can be seen in your video as only points that are being rendered are having shadows cast from them, this issue becomes more apparent as the angle of the shadows on your screen increase as well how ""long"" the shadows are. I may be wrong but I have never seen an enb not do this to some extent."

FalloutMods,3ayfn7,aanightmare,2,Wed Jun 24 14:39:05 2015 UTC,"Well, unfortunately, there aren't really any options that will give you acceptable anti-aliasing for New Vegas without a large performance impact.  There is:   Downsampling (using a program that renders the game in a resolution higher that your native resolution, and scales it so it fits on your monitor) This has the highest performance loss. It will also affect the size of HUD elements. ""Super-sampling"" though the ENB, the method you have already tried (Similar to downsampling, just does not require an external program) High to very high performance impact (resolution to sample from can be edited in one of the enb ini files). Will not affect HUD elements. Supersampling through NVInspector (edits advanced driver settings). Only compatible with enb versions before and including .173 This allows for much more customization in how well you want AA to work, but will still provide a very large performance impact (especially at higher settings) This method is featured in Gopher's follow up to the video you linked.   In terms of little performance impact, you can try tweaking the SMAA settings in sweetFX, it can help a very small amount, though at no additional performance impact."

FalloutMods,3aw8ul,kemaltje,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:32:41 2015 UTC,The water looks transparent in certain large rectangular sections
FalloutMods,3aw8ul,SkitsofRandom,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:33:54 2015 UTC,Try changing your water settings in the launcher.
FalloutMods,3aw8ul,GoldenDiamonds56,2,Wed Jun 24 00:45:14 2015 UTC,"Are you possibly using an enb? What my guess is that it's not lake mead that's having a problem, it's that somewhere along the lines your water rendering got screwed up. All the water you can see is most likely LODs that are loading in just fine."
FalloutMods,3aw8ul,wiseguy149,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:42:52 2015 UTC,nope. No enb

FalloutMods,3aw8ul,DuIstalri,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:03:18 2015 UTC,"I don't recognize all of your plugins, are any of these large texture packs?  You can have issues with textures vanishing in hi-res texture packs and similar stuff if you're not using the 4GB mod.  But this is really just a random guess based on some of the issues I've personally encountered before that look rather similar."
FalloutMods,3axq0m,AoiJitensha,2,Wed Jun 24 10:01:05 2015 UTC,You can do this in the pn rebalance options. There should be a skill point modifier.
FalloutMods,3axq0m,kemaltje,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:10:05 2015 UTC,"Thank you for taking the time to read my post. I am quite familiar with Project Nevada, and I am pretty sure that there is not an optional perk available to halve one's skill points for the ability to take a perk every level, nor the ability to buy perks from the 'level up' screen for skill points. Although, I would heartily welcome their addition to Project Nevada they are not currently included.   Project Nevada allows one to increase or decrease the ammount of levels per perk, it also allows one to adjust experience gain--these are talked about in the above post. I have JSawyer's mod installed alongside Project Nevada, which decreases experience gain by 50% and limits perks to one per two levels."
FalloutMods,3axq0m,kemaltje,3,Wed Jun 24 11:31:27 2015 UTC,Are you sure? If you select PN rebalance and then character there should be a leveling list. There you can choose the setting skill point mod. If you click that you can decrease skill point gain. So for example -5 skill points for one extra perk per level.
FalloutMods,3axq0m,IAMPOUNDCAKE,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:49:25 2015 UTC,"You are correct that you can do this with PN; but it is not quite the same as my idea. Having an option to buy a Perk for Skill Points in the level up screen would mean that it would be up to the player when and when not to use it--it would also be more interactive and feel more rewarding.  For some reason PN does the Skill decreases by a factor of two; so if I add Perk-per-level and then decrease my skills by 4 at the beginning of the game, I have to jump to 6, 8, 10 etc. No odd numbers. Plus, it would be nice to have a script do this for the player rather than having to jump into MCM and keep track of my own rules for using my imaginary Perk.   Yes, I can set up this effect in PN, I could also do it with console commands; but I feel that it would be worth having a mod that added the perk at the beginning of the game and did things behind scenes, gave the player the option to buy perks using skill points in the level-up screen etc. There are lots of mods people use that could be accomplished by jumping into console command, but having it seamlessly fit into the game is much more rewarding."
FalloutMods,3axq0m,IAMPOUNDCAKE,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:28:58 2015 UTC,"Alternatively, if anyone has experience making Perk mods, maybe they can point me towards some tutorials or information on how to make one; this is something I am interested in enough to try working on a little or partnering with an experienced modder to impliment."
FalloutMods,3axq0m,axelnight,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:28:21 2015 UTC,"Why? Just take a 'fun perk' every other level. Its what I do. Hell, its the entire reason why I bump up to a perk every level anyway. I got tired of the choice between 'fun' perks and ones that had an actual effect on gameplay. Crafting perks are especially big in this area, especially if you are playing with crafting overhauls."
FalloutMods,3axpqy,ChocolateExpert,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:57:05 2015 UTC,"You're probably talking about True Leaning by Xodrap. Other than that, no. No realistic leaning mods exist sadly. Xodrap's method that makes you invisible to NPCs is probably the only way to do it.   Xodrap took it off the Nexus a while back because he was reworking it in to a huge stealth/tactical overhaul he was working on, but nobody has heard anything from him or anything about that project in a long time sadly."
FalloutMods,3axpqy,captaincannibal,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:31:48 2015 UTC,"There was one other than Xodrap's that worked, but it was really buggy and not very fun, especially since opponents didn't use it.  e: here it is - http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/51777/? ""Cover Based Stealth Mechanics"" - great work by the author, but I just didn't enjoy it since it didn't make enemies ""smarter"", really (a limitation of the engine, not so much the mod itself.)"

FalloutMods,3ax8xe,bigmac80,2,Wed Jun 24 14:26:23 2015 UTC,I always liked the Outcast Power Armor from FO3.
FalloutMods,3ax8xe,rocktheprovince,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:14:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of the Outcast Power Armor as well.  Though I remember from I believer FWE, there was an Outcast retex of the T-51s.  I've considered using it but I can't find it on either FO3 or NV's nexus sites.  Is there just a stand alone mod of the retex some where?"
FalloutMods,3ax8xe,Diablo_Cow,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:02:57 2015 UTC,"Not that I've found, but I've never actually looked tbh. More of a riot armor guy myself, except in dire circumstances."
FalloutMods,3ax8xe,rocktheprovince,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:04:57 2015 UTC,Usually I'm the same.  But I was doing a TTW playthrough ran across some Outcast with a minigun.  Thought it was way too badass to not loot.  But then I remembered that I'd seen an outcast T-51 but couldn't quite remember how well the retex was.  So I've started searching for it to see if its worth the TTW conversion :p
FalloutMods,3ax8xe,Diablo_Cow,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:08:34 2015 UTC,Is this what you were thinking of?

FalloutMods,3axal4,TDLBallistic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:25:26 2015 UTC,"1 - you mean that if you go far for example 20 meters, and the deathclaw is sharpening the nails, it will continue doing it, and when it will finish it will reach you? or it will never move to you and remains sandboxing out there? 2 - I'm sorry but I didn't understand what you mean. 3 - seems more a mistake on the script / AI packages. I would double check everything. EDIT: the Waiting variable should be named exactly like in vanilla (you can compare the name with a vanilla companion), there are hardcoded behaviours connected to the name of the variable. 4 - It depends by the animations, but in general this is not very simple. If the sound is triggered by the idle itself, an easy solution could be introducing a specific condition that negates that idle for our companion (with a remote possibility of conflict); the hard solution would be modifying the idle's textdatas and introduce a new idle with a higher priority - which is a mess."
FalloutMods,3axal4,CazadoraDeAlmas,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"The Deathclaw will continue to sharpen nails/teeth/sit and not move until that idle is over, then they'll quickly rush to me and walk with me for a bit before doing it again. The idle animations are very frequent and override the... ""urge to follow"", I guess you could say? Y'know how you can ask companions to back-up? Like, if they're in your way or too close? It's under ""trade"", I believe. Basically, I click ""back-up"" and nothing happens. I'll check to make sure everything is in order. I followed a tutorial... maybe I messed up somewhere along the way.  I mean, if you sit near a Deathclaw they make this constant ""inhale/exhale"" breathing noise that's quite loud. Little Ripper's has had his toned down considerably, whereas my Deathclaw is vanilla in that respect. Then again, Little Ripper's mod did come with sound... but just playing it, it sounds like the normal game. Maybe it's coding? Who knows."
FalloutMods,3axal4,CazadoraDeAlmas,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"1) Mmmh... it's strange that an idle like that is supposed to stop a follower to follow. That must be definetely annoying. But personally the only solutions I can see are remove all these idles for that companion or edit their files with nifskope, both things are a pain. 2) I think I understand now (translation problems :P). Did you add the different follow packages and their variables? IsFollowingDefault and IsFollowingLong. 4) For that, I guess you must create your own audio template. The default one for Deathclaws is named ""AudioTemplateDeathclaw"". Under the tab ""Sounds"" you can find all the common sounds, the breathing one should be ""Conscious Loop""."

FalloutMods,3auzc7,Wabbstarful,2,Tue Jun 23 18:47:04 2015 UTC,"What you'll wanna do is create a new plugin with Fallout3.esm ticked. The window on the left should have a tab that says ""Items"". Expand it and click ""Armor"". Right click on the big list and click "" New"". Name it whatever you want, and go to the first model box. Find where the mesh for the Armor is stored and select it, then if it came with a world model, put that in the next box. Edit the stats, and you should be almost done, I think. Now in the bottom right box, make sure you're browsing Interior cells. Find the one that starts with ""MegatonPlayer"" I think. Drag the Armor from the box (click and drag on the ID of the Armor) and place it somewhere accessible in the cell. Save your plugin and you should be good. I might've messed up in there, but if you're really stuck, send me a PM and I'll see what I can do."

You did something wrong however. The AI mod you downloaded is an .exe so it will not work with nmm.    Download this file from nexus http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout3/mods/944/?

FalloutMods,3auh4k,WombatWithWings,3,Tue Jun 23 16:38:40 2015 UTC,Do not clean the bethesda files. Do not rely only on autoclean unless you know exactly what you are doing. This is NOT skyrim. The rh ironsights itms may be intentional. Check the MMM and other mods forum threads to see if they require cleaning. Contact the authors if you dont know or can't find anything.

FalloutMods,3atw2p,Corvus_Tech,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:06:06 2015 UTC,"If it was working fine yesterday, then the problem may actually be one of your autosaves/quicksaves corrupting.   Make a backup copy of your saves folder (it's in your Documents IIRC) and empty your saves out, then try again.  If it works after that, you've got a corrupted save.   Fallout 3 is notorious for corrupted autosaves, by the way, especially without a 64-bit memory address mod.  I strongly recommend running with autosaves (on location change, on sleep, etc) disabled and using Quicksaves for quick progress checkpoints.  Make manual (menu) saves for the important stuff."

(Google around for FO3Edit and how to make a merge file) Add Merge Files into load order (If it didn't do it automatically) Run LOOT again and adjust load order to compensate for Merge File. Test game.   Also it generally is for other issues but you might want to look up and try Archive Invalidation Invalidated which should help.  Make sure you always run the game/mod manager/game launcher as Admin as well.  Edit: I am pretty sure that StreetLights.esm should be below the Unoffical Patch.esm or alteast below all the DLC. I would check the Mod's nexus page for more help with that but I don't think anything should be above DLC."

FalloutMods,3arqz4,captaincannibal,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:54:07 2015 UTC,Merge Files are useful for any amount of mods. Lots of mods have overlapping features/textures/whatever the the merge file will sort out those conflicts. I don't know the exact details but if two mods have changed the same file or the same thing in game the merge file will choose one or the other. Stopping the conflict between mods.

If FOSE is working, it should return the number of whatever version you're using. Or, you can install the darNified UI and hovering over the vault boy in the bottom corner should tell you your FOSE version.  I don't actually remember if my steam overlay works with my game setup, but I just made a new game shortcut in steam to run foseloader.exe instead of fallout3.exe, and I'm pretty sure my overlay works… I could be remembering wrong though. You can try that and see if it works."

Personally Id try overclocking to 4ghz if your cooling system can handle it.  Im pretty sure you should be able to use mods + certain enbs maintaing full 60 fps. Granted, youre definitely going to want to use the 4gb expander for new vegas. By default its only allowed to use 2gb of ram. Theres a good sized list of tweaks to make new vegas perform smoother."

There are still places where I struggle to get to 60 FPS in my modded New Vegas installation with an ENB. It very much depends on what mods you're using.  That said, all of Bethesda's games are very CPU bound, and, given that you're running a more-than-decent graphics card, it's probably the biggest thing you can do to improve your performance. I've run the game on both my SSD and my HDD, and, frankly, I never noticed much of a different. I'm not very attentive to such things, but I wouldn't say it makes a massive difference, in any case."
FalloutMods,3araan,headpool182,4,Mon Jun 22 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"Make sure you've installed new Vegas 4GB loader and run the game through that EXE whenever you start.   Also make sure you have NVSE. Once that's installed, go into your data folder. There will be an 'SKSE' folder in there. Make a new file and name it 'nvse_config.ini'. Now open it up with notepad and paste the following:   [Memory]DefaultHeapInitialAllocMB=400   And save. Be sure to save it as a .ini file, rather than a .ini.txt file (I made that mistake once).  Lastly, install Enboost for New Vegas. In the Enblocal.ini, edit that and make sure the following settings are true:   [MEMORY]  ExpandSystemMemoryX64=false  ReduceSystemMemoryUsage=true  DisableDriverMemoryManager=false  DisablePreloadToVRAM=false  EnableUnsafeMemoryHacks=false  ReservedMemorySizeMb=256  VideoMemorySizeMb=2048  EnableCompression=true   If you want to mess with the settings a bit more to make sure it fits your specs, follow this guide. The settings I posted work for me and most people but it does somewhat depend on your hardware. For example, if you have a card with more or less than 2gb Vram, you'll need to edit    VideoMemorySizeMb=2048    to match your capability.   Edit:  Two things to note here. First of all, these three mods are not installed like normal mods. Read the specific instructions to make sure you get it right.  Second, the third step (enboost) is not always necessary. That will give you even more power, but your crashing issues might be resolved with the first two steps alone."
FalloutMods,3araan,rocktheprovince,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:13:14 2015 UTC,"Just a note: ExpandSystemMemoryX64 is probably unnecessary, and it has been known to cause issues with the SKSE memory patch for Skyrim, which does the same thing as the NVSE memory patch in New Vegas. I'd recommend setting it to false.   There will be an 'SKSE' folder in there.    It's the ""NVSE"" folder for New Vegas."
FalloutMods,3araan,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:37:06 2015 UTC,Derp. Thanks for pointing that out too. Do you know why it's an issue exactly?
FalloutMods,3araan,rocktheprovince,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:40:59 2015 UTC,"What it actually does is to instruct the game how to use the memory space available to it. By default, it fills the memory from the ""bottom"" of the space to the top, and ExpandSystemMemoryX64 switches that around, so it fills from the top to the bottom. The name comes, I think, from the fact that the function call being used (MEM_TOP_DOWN) was designed to test conversions of 32-bit applications to 64-bit ones.  The idea behind the change is that it reduces memory fragmentation, but it's not actually clear that it helps in at all. Even if it does, it's a very minor change. The problem is that the change affects the way that the SKSE memory patch (in Skyrim) allocates its heap blocks. Long story short, if ExpandSystemMemoryX64 is active and you give the first memory block more than 768 MiB and don't increase the second block from 256 MiB to 512 MiB, the game will crash on load. Since the second block will never ever use more than 256 MiB, it's a waste of memory that more than offsets any minor gains you get from having ExpandSystemMemoryX64 on in the first place.  A lot of this probably doesn't apply to New Vegas, since there's only one heap block available, and it can't be set above 500 MiB in the first place. But it's still probably a bad idea, since the performance gains are insignificant at best, and it's a pretty significant alteration to the way the executable works for that kind of gain."

FalloutMods,3aop6o,Ophichius,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:42:56 2015 UTC,"It would interfere due to how editing references works. Basically the game packages up an entire NPC or item as one block, and then layers the changes from successive ESP/ESM files over each other.  So let's say you've got one mod that changes an NPC's face. That mod has all the info for that NPC wrapped up as a single reference that overwrites everything about that NPC from the base game. When your mod is installed, it will overwrite everything that mod changed.

FalloutMods,3aop6o,captainniqqer,2,Mon Jun 22 21:48:44 2015 UTC,"Yep.  The other issue with any sort of big faction-changing mod would be bug testing it to make sure you don't break stuff. I don't think anything important is hooked into the faction system in an unpredictable way, but there's definitely some things that might go haywire. Top of the list of possibly unwanted behaviors would be if your NCR and NCR Civilian factions somehow end up hostile to each other due to friendly fire, as you'd then have NCR military gunning down NCR civs."

FalloutMods,3aqtjg,NukaCooler,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:57:38 2015 UTC,"clarifying for him/her: TTW is Tale of Two Wastelands. Great mod that lets you start the story in Fallout 3 and progress into New Vegas as the character develops. Project Nevada adds a bunch of sub-systems to the shooter part of the game (each almost entirely optional, but 95% of them really do add quite a bit so I've found it's worth installing all to make patching it into TTW easier) and adds a re-balance menu (you'll need the Mod Configuration Menu mod for this). In addition to these, my other core mod is Darnified UI, which adds some coloration and text size/font changes that make the game just a little easier to interact with (not that it was too hard before, just some streamlining.)  I'd recommend checking out GopherVid's videos as well (those helped me get the hang of setting up mods when I started), and I'm sure the other post here has a bunch of good information if you go through the links (I'm upvoting that one for visibility)"

FalloutMods,3aqtjg,mr_banhammer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:09:47 2015 UTC,"That depends on a LOT of things. Personally, I'd play through both games vanilla the first time and then use TTW every single time from then on out mainly because I wouldn't want to play Fo3 without Project Nevada's improvements to gunplay. So for me, I would totally re-start that with a character designed for both. But I run upward of 120 installed mods, so I may not be the best point of reference...  Are you planning on playing the games back to back? does the idea of traveling back and forth between the two wastelands with the same character and exploring both at the same time appeal to you? have you found some mods specifically for Fo3 you couldn't live without?  I'd also point out something I totally forgot about when I replied to the poster I replied to: TTW is still technically in beta. It's a fantastic experience, but you're likely to have to troubleshoot anything you add on on top of it because most mods are designed for either Fo3 or NV, not both. I played through each of those games modded before I discovered TTW, so I had some modding experience when I installed it. You might find you run into more problems with it than without, and might benefit from getting other mods running before you try to tackle that one. On the other hand, you learn a lot fast when you bite off more than you can chew, and if you've got just a little modding experience and some patience, it's well worth the extra work."

Regarding the Book of Flesh/Steel: I don't see an obvious issue in merging them, but rename it to in the Priority pane prior to merging, then choose that when installing the second mod.

FalloutMods,3aoffy,meohhoymenoime,2,Mon Jun 22 04:43:32 2015 UTC,"A lot of big mods do require them. Most of the best quest and house mods for example rely on a lot of their assets that you can't find in vanilla. Mainly you only need the main four (Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Dead Money, Lonesome Road) and GRA if you can. The other 3 are pretty unimportant. The stories of those main 4 also tie together heavily.  Tho you can definitely still have a really modded game without them, you'll run into limits and it might be kind of frustrating."
FalloutMods,3aoffy,rocktheprovince,2,Mon Jun 22 06:43:14 2015 UTC,"Most mods will say if they're needed. Not many need them I think. But if you're in a position where you can purchase the DLC without hurting your wallet or anything, please do. Old World Blues is fantastic, I believe they all are in truth (except perhaps Dead Money, which was great in its own right but incredibly difficult) and they add a lot to the game."
FalloutMods,3aoffy,br4inwashed,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:37:11 2015 UTC,"It depends on what you want to add via mods.  If you're looking at the little mods adding a single weapon or something, there's a decent chance you won't strictly NEED any DLC, but for larger mods like Boom to the Moon, there is a fairly good chance you will need at least one of the DLCs.  But with the largest mods, like WMX & CFW, there are usually modules that support users without the DLC.  Really it is a matter of choice, but I'd recommend getting all the DLCs, partially because the Ultimate Edition is on sale for just under $7.  The DLCs give you a lot more replay value, even Dead Money."

FalloutMods,3anjac,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:13:10 2015 UTC,"It can be done, within the limits of the game engine, of course (New Vegas doesn't work with more than 139 active plugins/masters). As with any large load order, though, it might require patience and occassional manual intervention with FNVEdit and the like.  I'm currently running a TTW install with 132 active plugins, which is the absolute limit that I can run before the game engine starts glitching out on me.

FalloutMods,3ani5d,MatityahuC,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:21:15 2015 UTC,"You will need both those, from the looks of it.  Also, the FOIP WMK + FWE-patch will most likely change things by the Blackened patch, you will probably have to manually create a merged patch where you get the visuals from EVE and the mods from WMK."
FalloutMods,3anudl,SandyMakai,2,Mon Jun 22 01:16:22 2015 UTC,"Download this one http://fose.silverlock.org/download/fose_v1_2_beta2.7z Open it up and drop all the files where ever you downloaded FO3. There should be an .exe in you folder now called fose_loader. Right click and make a shortcut and put the shortcut on your desktop. Run the fose_loader. Press the tilde ""~"" and type getfoseversion if it says something like version 1 you installed fose correctly.   When playing fo3 with mods you WILL have to run it with the fose loader or it will not work."
FalloutMods,3anudl,kemaltje,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:34:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. I downloaded the file and there is no fose_loader.exe.

FalloutMods,3anudl,kemaltje,2,Mon Jun 22 15:24:40 2015 UTC,That is pretty weird. I uploaded the 7zip to dropbox download that and tell me if it works. If not i'll try to chnage it into a .rar

The inventory sorter that comes with Project Nevada tags quest items with [QST] and pretty much everything it doesn't tag is junk. Meaning it doesn't need to be tagged, according to the author of the mod, I would assume."
FalloutMods,3amj8k,thexsa,1 point,Mon Jun 22 11:30:31 2015 UTC,"I can understand in one respect that because there are so many items and most of them aren't used for anything, that not tagging junk items can save effort on the mod author's part... however here's my logic if I make this and share it with others:  If you find an item that has absolutely no tag, you shouldn't have to wonder: Is this something that is junk and safe to sell or ignore, or is it something the mod author has simply missed.  As we aren't likely to get anymore official DLC for FO NV at this point, it's not like I even need to worry about the purpose of items changing at this point. If an item is junk at this point in the game them it'll be junk until someone makes a mod that uses it."

For a second run they are more then welcome but first time experience should be with suggested mod settings.  Fallout Character Overhaul is redundant as DUST has custom npc faces. That said, i used it for the Playable Races module and run as a ghoul, since default ghoul race is glitchy.

FalloutMods,3amckl,asdknvgg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:42:53 2015 UTC,fwe is on the difficult side of mods but not by a lot. it only feels like it because fallout 3 vanilla is so fucking easy that a lvl 1 character with 10mm pistol can go as deep as he wants into DC.  FWE requires a little bit of planning to beat large groups of enemies

FalloutMods,3amckl,balanceofpower,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:34:05 2015 UTC,"Are you running a mod called CombatEnhanced? If so that might explain your problem. I don't recommend running CE (or any AI combat improvement mod) and FWE together. CE basically gives enemies better aim and longer detection range. With vanilla fallout it feels like a nice bump in difficult, but with FWE it becomes too brutal because the damage is increased AND they can aimbot you from really far away.  However, oddly enough I ended up giving up on FWE and keeping CombatEnhanced. I feel FWE changes too many things. At the end of the day FWE isn't really all that original, it's literally a compilation of other mods already found on the Nexus, just bundled and changes Fallout 3's combat from tactical to a twitchy shooter, it doesn't really increase the difficult so much as simply give you a smaller margin for error."

FalloutMods,3amckl,balanceofpower,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think so.  It's not in my mod list."
FalloutMods,3amq46,aprancingelephant,2,Sun Jun 21 19:12:44 2015 UTC,"Well, I like adding player houses with quest lines. Firefly Ranch and Underground Hideout are pretty cool. I added Driveable Motorcycles with the Garage Base. I also add Weapon Mod Kits and Powered Power armor just for funsies. Gives you a little more customization.  DC Interiors opens up a lot of those places you can't explore in vanilla. If you like exploring, get it. Mart's Mutant Mod - adds lots of creatures, passive and aggro, and I enjoy the challenge they bring.  Fallout Wanderers edition adds a lot of weapons and ammo to the game, but it can also make things a lot more difficult if you don't plan. It's more of a realism thing but it's also just got some great mechanics that I think really step the game up. Use alternate travel to turn off fast travel for a whole new experience. Seriously, walking pretty much everywhere can be tedious, but it makes even getting to your quest objective feel like an accomplishment. Also ammo crafting is cool. If you install FWE I would highly recommend installing Fast Vats (use version 2 inside the archive). FWE slows you down, but the mobs still have normal action speed which seems contrary to the point of VATS to me.  As for visual updates: NMC's Texture Pack is great. Use the performance version. Even if you have a beast of a computer, it's pretty much identical to the full version. I've also added Precision Clutter and a bunch of hires textures for things like booze, books, and general clutter. Just so everything looks good. For lighting and shaders : Fellout and Project Reality are both great. I prefer Fellout with Enhanced Rain and Snow but that's just me. Goes great with Realistic Interior Lighting, Fallout Street Lights, and Fallout Street Lights Wasteland. Flora Overhaul - Dead Edition. Closest to vanilla, requires some ini tweaks. Adds so much more pretty to the world but still fits the whole 'nuclear apocalypse' thing. I also recommend installing MTUI with UIO, Adjustable HUD, Immersive HUD, Imaginator, Cinematech, Dynavision, and Directors Chair. They give you control over lighting and film effects like grain or blur. Dynavision is dynamic depth of field that I've found to be just wonderful for softening distant edges and near vision focus. Also, Energy Visuals Enhanced is another obvious thing you'll want.  For characters: Fallout Redesigned, Dimonized type 3, and Fallout Reanimated. I've had some issues with Redesigned not loading textures properly so I removed it. Everything still looks pretty good though. Dimonized is only for female characters and it seems you deal with a lot of them so I'm not too worried about it. And Enhanced Blood Textures - ""Holy shit I punched that guys head and it exploded :D""  For utility mods I like to have No Theft Comments and No Knocked Over Comments. That way everyone isn't constantly yelling at me. Though with Precision Clutter I seem to run into less stuff. I also run the Max Level 99 mod with the Ultimate Perk Pack. I only use Quest and Experience perks so there isn't too much extra crap I don't need. I've added 5x Faster Waiting because what's the point of that being slow? Fallout Audio Overhaul. I remove a lot of the music because I also add the X-1 Radio Station and GNR Enhanced. I make sure to leave tension and boss in there though. It really does make a difference. I would also suggest adding Delay Radio DLC. That way you're forced to discover the DLC content rather than just be given it as soon as you leave the vault. Speaking of, I add Vault 101 Revisited. Just thought it would be neat to go back and visit. Mothership Zeta Crew - crazy awesome mod. I also add the MZC Retextures with the pulsing abomination textures. It's super cool. And the Realistic Earth from Space. Because Pretty. Arefu Expanded (also included with Crimson Caravan) and Rivet City Reborn. All the vanilla stuff is still there but there's extra stuff that lets you get more in depth with those specific cities. Cross Repair Weapons, Armor, and DLC let's you use more crap to repair guns. Not sure how necessary it is with FWE but I still use it so if you choose not to go the FWE path, it's a wonderful addition. Just expands the repair lists a bit without being overpowered. Flashlight - obviously. Use the performance one over LOS. I get a few crashes with the LOS version. I also like knowing where the caravans are so I use Caravan Tracking. you select the quest and it shows all the caravans on the map. Mostly I just use it to find a close place to sell some junk. I contemplate adding rich vendors but I feel like that wouldn't be accurate to the concept. It would be super convenient though.  Now, for all of these awesome mods, you're going to want Unofficial Updated Fallout 3 patch, Fallout Stutter Remover, FOSE, as well as use the Blackened and Paradox Ignition versions for a lot of the bigger mods in here. FOIP you probably won't need but I think the FWE/WMK one is still relevant. Just so all these big mods can work together.  That is pretty much a rundown of what I use and enjoy immensely. So at the very least you've got a good place to start. I use Mod Organizer because it works on mod isolation so that if I ever want to go back to straight vanilla or just create another modpack containing Real Time Settlers or something I can.  If you're interested, you might look into Tale of Two Wastelands. It stables FO3 up and adds a few new features. I'm not sure what it's compatible with though.

FalloutMods,3amq46,ErusPrime,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"Well, there are a lot of mods. In terms of game changes, it pretty much overhauls the entire game but I tried to stay fairly true to the wanderer concept. If you actually go in and install these things it's not too much. It's a pain the in the ass to get them working together but once you have that down it's pretty easy to manage.  I've also gone through and merged a lot of the mods into ""install sections"" based on things that need a specific install order. I really only install 5 or 6 archives but it gives me all this wondrousness."
FalloutMods,3ammmo,xtcz,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:42:46 2015 UTC,"FOMM is a front to activate and deactivate the mods, just like you can through your FO3 launcher.  The actual mods you use with FOMM are put into your data file, which is the same used by steam.  Yes, as long as the mods are ticked either in FOMM or your launcher, they will work through steam. Although NVSE is another question."

Anyway, download it manually to wherever you want so you can work on it. You are going to have to extract it, use winrar or 7-zip, select ""Extract to More Perks 2_4..blah, blah"", delete the original 7-zip, then simply create a new archive using the extracted file with same name on your desktop.   In MO, hit Install from Archive, and choose that new archive. Install manually, right click on it, and Set Data Directory and it should ""Look Good"", hit OK.   I don't use it personally, but it should install fine."

FalloutMods,3alu1u,Debuggi,5,Sun Jun 21 14:12:48 2015 UTC,"Bug fix and anticrash and stutter mods are pretty much mandatory. I'd also recommend CASM, because the built in auto save system can crash too.  I'd hold off on major game play changing mods like MMM, FWE, FOOK, etc.  Those are meant to make the game more challenging for veteran players. There are mods for things like iron sights, classic fallout weapons, and weapon mods that will just make the game play a bit more New Vegas-like. Graphical overhauls are largely a matter of personal taste. Everyone should at least be running Fellout, IMO, with or without the darker nights."
FalloutMods,3alu1u,FancyCat2008,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:29:49 2015 UTC,Generally outside of bug fixes and textures its not a good idea to mod because you don't yet know what changes you want to make.

FalloutMods,3aly2s,ernieballer,2,Sun Jun 21 14:57:39 2015 UTC,Turn off your ENB and see if they still look like that. I remember having this happen a long time ago and it was caused by my ENB because of some setting there or in my INI. I really wish I could remember what it was though.
FalloutMods,3alxt3,PsycoEmu,2,Sun Jun 21 14:54:41 2015 UTC,"I had similar problems in FNV when using TTW. Once I installed the 4gb patch and NVAC, all my problems went away. For Fallout 3, perhaps the Large Address Aware mod might fix your problems.  Also, this tutorial is supposed to help fix crash and freeze issues with Fo3.   Turns out the patch for 1.1 breaks quad core support. The game can't handle 4 cores anymore. So if you have a quad core pc (or any other cores for that matter :D) and you install the latest patch the game will start crashing. There are instructions on how to fix this.   Open up the fallout.ini file in: My Documents\My Games\Fallout3  Find the line:   bUseThreadedAI=0   change it to:   bUseThreadedAI=1   Add another line after it and insert:   iNumHWThreads=2   This will limit the game to 2 cores and prevent the engine bug from causing the game to freeze.  -------FOR THE PEOPLE WHO STILL CRASH--------  Instead of iNumHWThreads=2, change it to iNumHWThreads=1   Make sure to backup your .ini file before trying, just in case."

People seemed to like it though, as it got me enough endorsements to get into the modmakers nexus. Next I made a bulk ammo crafting mod, which allows you to craft in bundles of 10. That introduced me to conditions and crafting recipes. My first big mod was adding weapon repair kit functionality into fallout 3, introducing me to scripting and using message boxes as menus.

JSawyer's has this integrated too.   An alternative to Mobile Truck Base would be the Winnebego mod. It has XRE support so you can physically drive it or use the fast travel feature like Mobile Truck Base has. What I usually do is post up camp somewhere and explore the radius of the area for resources, then go back and craft/sort/allocate whatever I got. Mods that expand crafting menus help a lot with that.   Nevada Skies has 'moods' that can definitely slow you down. Beyond fire storms, rad storms, sand storms, and storms, there's also a mist feature that makes it really hard to see in front of you without infared vision and a couple others like that. I'd say it makes traveling on foot a lot more fun, planning your shelters more interesting, etc.   If you really wanna get sick with it, pick up endless warfare and make your game into a zombie survival game. The settings are really customizable, so you can make them avoid open settlements, only spawn at night or in exteriors, have high damage but low health, change their speed, how often they spawn (or randomize it), and give them ghost-people powers where you have to blow off a limb to kill them.   Companions with back stories (Niner and Delilah, mainly) also give you a lot more stuff to do on the road earlier in the game."

FalloutMods,3ak4tr,kemaltje,2,Sun Jun 21 00:02:55 2015 UTC,"Med-Tek Trauma Kit isn't exactly what you're looking for, but makes it easier and more realistic to heal limbs in hardcore mode. You need a medical brace and a stimpac to heal one, so it's not much different than just using a stimpac in normal mode. When you find a doctor's bag you can just unpack it and use the contents inside."

FalloutMods,3ak4tr,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not aware of any released mods that do that, but it's not an unreasonable request, honestly. There are plenty of times I've wished that the hardcore changes were modular, since there are certainly times that, say, I want ammo to have weight but don't want my companions to have permadeath.  I started poking around with FNVEdit to see what could be done, and my results have been a bit mixed. Editing Stimpaks so that they restore limb condition is easy enough: there's just a conditional check on IsHardcore that can be removed. Unfortunately, while that means that every time you use a Stimpak, all of your limbs are healed a little bit, there's still no way I can find to apply a Stimpak directly to an specific injured limb. That functionality appears to be locked out of the Pip-Boy in hardcore mode, and I can't figure out how it's done or how to disable it. I also can't figure out where to look for healing during sleep. So it's not much help, sorry."

FalloutMods,3ajccy,rocktheprovince,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:12:15 2015 UTC,"How does that work? I think it was the one I was looking for but couldn't recall the name of, thanks! Will it drastically change my character's mesh, or does it leave that intact?   For lighting I use Nevada Skies--not really strictly lighting,  but I'm satisfied with it!"
FalloutMods,3ajccy,rocktheprovince,2,Sat Jun 20 22:24:55 2015 UTC,"Well this one doesn't require a new game to install but it's recommended. If you use it on an existing save at least be sure to wait 3+ days in an interior to let changes take effect.   So just download the main file here. The only special instruction is to check your Falloutprefs.ini and make sure:   bLoadFaceGenHeadEGTFiles=1   =1. The Falloutprefs.ini can be found in mygames/FNV (not in the Steam folder, usually) and you can edit it with notepad. If you use Mod Organizer you'll have to edit it from within Mod Organizer.   It also requires Old World Blues. If you get a glitch where people's eyes seem to drift off to the side, there's a way to fix it but I'd just install High Res Eye Replacer.   As for meshes, yes and no. It adds a bunch of new meshes but keeps the 2 vanilla ones intact. So your existing character would still have the same face until you edit it in Racemenu. But NPCs around the world do have altered meshes, yeah."
FalloutMods,3ajccy,rocktheprovince,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:32:20 2015 UTC,"What does waiting in an interior do? o: I know that helps with things like Nevada Skies or Wasteland Flora Overhaul, but I don't really know what it does outside of that!  I definitely don't want to start a new save since I'm about 100 hours into this newest one now, but remaking his appearance isn't out of the question! I have to use Rebirth to do it, though, since console doesn't work for me. I think it actually has something to do with me using a gamepad..?  I read the page on the Nexus (sorry, was on mobile before), and I notice that it has a Mikoto patch, so that's great!  I'm no modding wiz or anything, not by a long shot, but I definitely hope I'm at least not hopeless with it! I'm sorry if any of my questions seem painfully obvious, though. I haven't touched NPCs or faces or bodies at all yet, or companions or quests. I tend to keep it mostly vanilla content-wise, so anything to do with characters is new to me."
FalloutMods,3ajccy,rocktheprovince,2,Sat Jun 20 23:37:19 2015 UTC,"It just lets the game sort of 'reset' itself. New enemies spawn, loot is reset, etc. Honestly 3 days was just a guess on my part. It could be like a week.  I'm not sure what you mean as far as rebirth vs. consoles, as I've never used rebirth and don't actually know what that is, hah.   With Mikito's, it is compatible but last I checked there's still a specific process to get it working right. It basically amounts to letting the right things overwrite each other and sorting your load order. Mikito wrote a guide not long ago, be sure to look for that.   As for your questions, don't worry about it! That's what we're here for. When I started modding I didn't even know about reddit and learned everything to painfully hard way (repeatedly breaking my game). Wouldn't wish that on anybody :p"

Because I use a gamepad, the console key doesn't work unless I deactivate my controller every time I wanna use it, to my understanding. ...So I'm happy to compromise with a terminal I can interact with instead!  Alright, I'll hunt it down! Any idea where I should look? Thanks :D  Oooogh, I thankfully haven't done that yet! ...Somehow! ...My data folder is an utter train-wreck, though, as last time I modded I...went ahead and manual installed everything. Oogh.

FalloutMods,3ajccy,IonutRO,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:59:25 2015 UTC,"Yep! Usually any mod that adds new spawns will need time for things to reset. And since FCO changes some things like how raider look, you probably won't see the difference there until they get a chance to respawn.   Actually, I just looked into it and it's quite a bit simpler than I thought. Just install Mikito first, make sure it's behind FCO in your load order, and specifically don't let Mikito's eye textures overwrite FCO's or you'll get that glitch I mentioned.   But let me know if FCO works for you! And if not, maybe post a screenshot so I know what you mean."

Sounds pretty similar to the NMC + Vurt's WFO compatibility, then. I messed that one up the first time around and all the cholla cacti were these blurry abominations for a bit :B So if I have this right... Install Mikoto (done), install FCO, and do? or don't let FCO overwrite the eyes? Do I want Mikoto's eyes or FCO's? ...And then FCO is above Mikoto in my load order, correct?  Sure sure! I haven't installed it yet, but I have it downloaded. Here's my fella from my last playthrough that I happened to screencap while I was messing around. He's not as orange as he was a few hours ago, but...when you consider he's supposed to look more like this it becomes a problem :B he's pretty gross aaaaaa i'm so sorry"
FalloutMods,3ajccy,IonutRO,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:29:05 2015 UTC,"Yep, you got it right. Install FCO over Mikito's. You want FCO's eyes, and if all else fails for any reason you can just use the high res eye replacer too. So in your load order, it'll roughly be;   Fallout New Vegas Mikito's FCO   I'm not sure if that's 'lower' or 'higher' technically but you want FCO last, pretty much.   In comparison to ranger Andy your character actually does look normal haha. I forgot what it was like with Vanilla characters. So this and this is what you should expect.

FalloutMods,3aikkj,NukaCola4Life,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:10:55 2015 UTC,In my experience (I'm about 30 hours in on my first PN playthrough) hard/very hard is the way to go. But that all depends on what settings you're using for PN. Grab MCM and tweak the settings to your liking. All the values you can tweak are shown on the PN nexus page. Do some experimenting!
FalloutMods,3aikkj,Ridjeck,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:46:30 2015 UTC,"If you have PN Extra Options, I recommend using the Hard Hardcore preset and raising the hunger/sleep to 500, and thirst to 1000.  Beware that mods will probably be balanced for Vanilla, so you may have to lower settings."
FalloutMods,3aikkj,LifeThirdTier,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:57:09 2015 UTC,Lower settings or raise settings ? If they are balanced for vanilla then wouldn't raising settings make it harder?
FalloutMods,3aikkj,rocktheprovince,2,Sat Jun 20 18:05:12 2015 UTC,"This depends. For example; ""Beyond Boulder Dome"" is a completely new worldspace. But any PN settings that alter loot rarity still apply to it's containers. The only thing you have to worry about balancing so much is combat and quest rewards. Quest rewards are really never that big of a deal, and for combat I'd highly recommend letting one of the realistic weapon damage mods over-ride your PN settings. That way everything is basically locked to a set difficult point.   Personally I like to set the timescale to 6 or 8 (8 in NV because that's what PN supports), and if you do that you might want to raise the thirst/sleep/eat levels more to compensate for slower time."

FalloutMods,3ajiye,DropkickCleary,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:07:53 2015 UTC,"We're talking Fallout 3, though, not New Vegas. The problem is that there are certain quests in Fallout 3 where any modification to the Pip-Boy can cause problems: I know that Tranquility Lane causes problems, and the Anchorage DLC might do, as well. The standard ""fix"" for this is to simply turn off the mod affecting the Pip-Boy until you get past the quest, and the complicated installation/removal process for Readius can make that tricky.  It shouldn't be too difficult if you use Mod Organizer, though. Or you can use the Pip-Boy 2500, which is quite similar to Readius, but easier to turn on and off at a whim."

You'll need to get the patch between the convergence and MMUE on the latter's page though. I can tell you more when I get home. That will already make the game much better.

Director's Chair, in Skyrim at least, has settings like this that blur everything heavily. That mod isn't meant to be used like the other three, it's only temporary effects for screenshots.

Someone may correct me."
FalloutMods,3ah6a6,ZauDex93,5,Sat Jun 20 03:35:22 2015 UTC,"Once you run the tww installation and it creates the two fmod files, the main and optional file, you drag them into the downloads folder in your Mod Organizer directory.

I think its going to be a lot like Steam Workshop and Skyrim. It had a lot of hype, and I'm sure it helped a lot of newcomers get into modding, but the limitations on the kind of mods you can get from there (in terms of size, reliance on third-party script extenders, etc.) made it decidedly unappealing to someone with a bit of familiarity and experience. If anything, the limitations for console players are only going to be greater than that.  That doesn't mean it's a bad thing, to be sure.

From what I understand, it can create more conflicts, which will need to be resolved or lived with through merge-patch editing, if you install in a different order.  Im still updating in order of my initial installation, so that should minimize the impact a little.  The organizing capabilities of FOMM are significant and generous.  Its like a '90's dos word-processer.  Slow and stable.    Im interested to see if the finished product is as good as I hope it will be.  By using Fomm Together with the xEdit merge plugin script, it should be both stable and flexible.  <maniacal laugh>  So, anyways, thanks.  I'll try it with Skyrim, or Fallout 3 again.

NMM may be good enough, but it also may not be.    There's a hitch with using NMM.  Many of the mods you might want to use may be old-ish, and way back in 2012 Fomm was the only game in town for FNV.  NMM may have updated, but some of those mods havent been touched in years.  Also, Fomm may look outdated, but it is still being maintained and developed.  Personally, I use NMM for downloading and tracking, a sync tool, and then Fomm for installation.  MO failed for me with Fallout right off the bat.    It would be nice to have some more definitive information about different strengths, weakness', and combinations of the tools.  Actually, I find it a little strange that the subject isnt discussed more often.  Good luck."

In all seriousness, there's probably a limit to what can be done, even cosmetically. You might be able to change the UI font, but almost everything else we either don't know enough about yet (how the skill/perk system works, for instance) or is hard coded by the engine (no player character voice overs, no dialogue wheel, no slow-motion VATS, etc.). The Elder Scrolls games are a good case study: there are a handful of mods that successfully tried to make Morrowind play more like Oblivion (increasing weapon accuracy, improving stamina regeneration), and even fewer than did much to make Oblivion play more like Skyrim. Despite the perception, there are some very real limitations to what you can via modding."

I don't like the removal of item degradation and repair, either (weirdly, it didn't bother me in Skyrim, but it was a big part of the scrounging/survival feel of the past two games). I don't like the voiced protagonist, though it's more of a reaction to the changes associated with that (like the dialogue wheel) than a deep-seated dislike of the change itself. And I'm skeptical about changes to the skill/perk system, although we obviously don't have the full story about that just yet. And I'm also concerned that the inclusion of immortal companions means the absence of a hardcore mode, or, at least, a hardcore mode that removes a lot of what I liked about the New Vegas version of it."
FalloutMods,3aheed,WildfireDarkstar,2,Sat Jun 20 15:48:10 2015 UTC,"I can understand most of those, except the shooter-derived gameplay part. What specifically do you find wrong with it? I always felt NV's shooting was incredibly clunky, but I don't see how that added anything to the game.  I realize this is getting way out into opinion territory, but if FNV had had buttery-smooth shooting gameplay I don't think it would have made it a worse game.  Or are you worried that they're going to simply emphasize setpiece out-and-out shooter play over exploration and cautious, careful engagement?"
FalloutMods,3aheed,Ophichius,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:01:07 2015 UTC,"I don't like FPSes. I find them incredibly tedious and repetitive. I don't like changes that emphasize FPS-style mechanics because nothing happens in a vacuum. A developer doesn't spend years honing the shooter mechanics, hiring developers from id and Bungie, only to turn around and give you an option to play the game more like a traditional RPG. We've already seen a taste of that change in the alterations to VATS: in switching to slow-mo mode, it removes at least some of the ability to stop and consider your shots. It's still likely going to be better than working outside of VATS, but it's worse than what we had in Fallout 3 and New Vegas (which were, in turn, worse than what we had in Fallout and Fallout 2)."
FalloutMods,3aheed,WildfireDarkstar,3,Sat Jun 20 16:05:40 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I can see the tradeoff in resources being worrisome, but that sounds more like you're blaming mechanics for developer choices.  Clunky gameplay is clunky no matter what, and as long as it's going to be a first person game, shouldn't it have the smoothest, most enjoyable gameplay possible?  I do absolutely worry about the writing, but then Bethsoft has never been known for strong writing, so I've sort of given up hopes that they'll have anything near the depth of quest design that F1 or F2 had. Heck, if they even get close to writing multi-approach quests the way FNV did I'll consider that a win.  Maybe I'm focused on the wrong thing here, but it seems to me that all the incredibly respected RPGs of ages past are held up on the merits of their quest design and approach to player freedom. Games like Deus Ex, Fallout 1 & 2, Planescape: Torment, and Arcanum are all lauded for the way they allowed the player to choose how to tackle a problem. Not for their mechanics in and of themselves (Lord knows most of them were at least a little clunky, if not downright painful to interact with.). So, given that we know Bethsoft have never before demonstrated the ability to make deep, multi-approach quests, shouldn't we at least hope that the core gameplay is smooth, rather than being painful? FO3's gunplay was atrocious, FNV's was barely tolerable. Can we hope for FO4's gunplay to actually be good, and perhaps that Bethsoft will hand the next installment over to Obsidian to do some real writing?"
FalloutMods,3aheed,Ophichius,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say that it's more a case of divining developer choices from mechanical changes. The fact that Bethesda chose to emphasize shooting at least suggests a distancing from the non-shooting mechanics of the series. Which, I think, is a reasonable bit of speculation, even if it's certainly not guaranteed to be correct.  The biggest problem is that a lot of the ""clunky"" shooting in Fallout 3 and New Vegas was a deliberate choice to emphasize the RPG mechanics of the series. When people complain about, say, poor aim at the beginning of the game, they're basically complaining that accuracy is based on a calculation of stats (like an RPG) rather than player skill (like an FPS). It's rarely a zero sum game, in other words: making a better FPS typically means making a weaker RPG. And I'm also not quite on board with the idea that having a first person perspective means it needs to play like an FPS, any more than having an overhead perspective would mean it needs to play like the 8-bit Legend of Zelda games (for instance).  I'm not holding out a whole lot of hope of the story, either, but I don't think mods are going to be able to do too much to change the core of it, so I'm not expecting them to do so. But I would argue that games like the first two Fallout games, or the Infinity Engine games (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment), or (going back even further) the AD&D Gold Box titles are very much remembered for their gameplay and mechanics. The Fallout series, in particular, was hugely well known for introduction of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system.  The idea that, basically, nobody liked these games for their mechanics is a revisionist view typically pedaled by a modern industry that holds the FPS up as the gold standard to which all games must aspire. Which, again, as someone who hates FPSes, is an attitude I find hugely frustrating. It's also one that I'd hope the recent success of games that specifically eschew that idea (the latest XCOM, Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity, etc.) would have diminished, at least to some extent. But that doesn't seem to be the case."

The clunky shooting in FO3 and FNV was not deliberate by any means. It's possible to have stat-based shooting without having it feel as atrociously awful as it did in those two games. (Deus Ex did this pretty solidly for the time.). The actual handling of movement, animation, and the incredibly poor mesh alignment of sights in FNV are all issues which are not related to stats, but are issues of quality. I have no problem with accuracy and reload rates being stat-controlled, those are good places to insert the effect of stats on gunplay. The problem was that every aspect of the shooting experience was a shoddy one.  Also, minor nitpick: I believe you meant it's a zero-sum game. Zero-sum games in game theory are ones in which gains in one area are proportional to losses in another.   The idea that, basically, nobody liked these games for their mechanics is a revisionist view typically pedaled by a modern industry that holds the FPS up as the gold standard to which all games must aspire.

But that doesn't seem to be the case.   Having actually recently re-played Baldur's Gate and Torment, I have to disagree about mechanics. I disliked the mechanics when I first played them two decades ago, and I still find them clunky today. It's not revisionism. The story is great, the combat mechanics are somewhere between so-so and awful. THAC0 was a bloody stupid way to calculate defense, and random rolling for stats is archaic as hell. And don't get me started on Vancian magic systems...  I don't think that FPSes are what every game should aspire to be, but if you're going to have a game that's in first person, involving shooting, then why not do it right? There's no excuse to have clunky, janky animations and misaligned sights."
FalloutMods,3aheed,Ophichius,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:56:43 2015 UTC,"Having actually recently re-played Baldur's Gate and Torment, I have to disagree about mechanics. I disliked the mechanics when I first played them two decades ago, and I still find them clunky today. It's not revisionism. The story is great, the combat mechanics are somewhere between so-so and awful. THAC0 was a bloody stupid way to calculate defense, and random rolling for stats is archaic as hell. And don't get me started on Vancian magic systems...   That's fine; you can like or dislike whatever you please. And it's not even like I think you're alone in that, since it's clearly the prevailing trend in modern game design. But the idea that the fact that you didn't enjoy the gameplay means that other don't, or that they weren't lauded for their gameplay design both at the time and by a sizable contingent of gamers to this day is manifestly incorrect. The biggest selling point of Baldur's Gate upon its release was its recreation of the AD&D rule set, and the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system was absolutely a big deal at the release of the original Fallout.   There is an assumption in modern AAA game design that older games only made the design choices they did because they didn't know any better, or because of ""technical limitations"" that, in essence, stopped them from being Call of Duty in 1997. The implication, then, is that it's completely logical that so many games would converge upon the same basic mechanics, and that reacting against that trend is somehow ""being against change"" in the general sense. That's complete bunk, and it's a huge part of the sorry state and lack of variety of the big budget gaming industry today. Making Fallout a better FPS is not a cause for celebration in my book in any way, shape, or form. And until there's a serious argument for making Call of Duty a better point and click adventure game, I can't help but feel protective of the series as it once was.   I don't think that FPSes are what every game should aspire to be, but if you're going to have a game that's in first person, involving shooting, then why not do it right? There's no excuse to have clunky, janky animations and misaligned sights.   No, but it's not the animations I'm reacting against (and, honestly, I'm not hugely impressed by what we've seen of the animations in the Fallout 4 sizzle reel, even if they are a nominal improvement over earlier games). A lot of people reacting against New Vegas and demanding changes for Fallout 4 absolutely were asking, in one way or another, for ""more responsive"" shooting, where it's quite clear that ""responsiveness"" meant ""based on player skill."" The fact that the older games don't work that way is absolutely not accidental, as it's one of the key things that makes them RPGs and not an FPSes. Which the game absolutely does not have to be just because it's in first person perspective and involves guns. Are there ways to improve the mechanics of Fallout 3 and New Vegas? Of course. But what little we've seen of Fallout 4 so far (slow motion VATS, for instance) doesn't strike me as an improvement, it strikes me as another attempt to reduce the gameplay to the same tired, repetitive FPS-style shooting I find incredibly boring."
FalloutMods,3aheed,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:54:40 2015 UTC,"So aside from VATS, what aspects of the NV shooter mechanics do you think deliver a better experience than what we've seen in the FO4 reel? I originally started this chain of discussion hoping to find ideas for mods to develop, but you've basically just repeated ""Bleh FPS, new VATS is bad"" a few times now without explaining in any sort of detail which actual mechanics changes you feel should be undone and why."
FalloutMods,3aheed,Ophichius,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"Visually maybe. A lot of the fnv mechanics are hard-coded, so not much can be done there. Weapon mods are limited to 3 per weapon, need a whole new mesh for each nodded variant, and can only apply one effect."
FalloutMods,3aheed,NukaCooler,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:55:37 2015 UTC,"True, but it may be possible to do what WMK did in FO3 as a workaround, i.e. have each potential weapon combination as a different entry, and then add a shit-ton of crafting recipes to work between them."
FalloutMods,3aheed,thegreatvortigaunt,3,Sat Jun 20 13:59:40 2015 UTC,"Ugly though. The way weapon mod models are hardcoded at the moment means that to have n mods, you need 2n meshes, so 23 = 8 meshes for 3 mods. Then 16, 32, 64, 128 for 4, 5, 6, 7 mods respectively. It just gets way too much effort. What needs to happen is that the mods toggle the visibility of parts of the mesh. So on an assault rifle you might have:  Barrel: heavy, extended underbarrel: foregrip, grenade launcher Muzzle attachment: Silencer, flash hider, recoil compensator, bayonet scope: ironsights, red dot, 4x, 8x Stock: wood, wire folding, polymer reciever: hardened magazine: extended, drum  and then the game checks for HasMod ""   "" to toggle visibility of those parts."
FalloutMods,3aheed,NukaCooler,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:25:25 2015 UTC,"True, but if it was currently possible for NV to disable parts of a mesh depending on mods, Obsidian would have probably done that for their weapon mod system anyway, instead of having nine separate meshes for the bloody 9mm pistol.  But then again, your way suggests that silencer/flash hider/compensator/bayonet are all on the mesh at the same time, and that the unequipped mods are invisible. Having upwards of 18 separate meshes on one weapon model that all respond to scripts and variables could get real heavy and game-crashy very quickly, this is Gamebryo/Creation we're talking about.  I honestly have no idea how Bethesda is going to optimise 700 bloody weapon mods, and tens of thousands of potential combinations. I reckon they won't actually have any complete weapons saved as wholes, but just a shit-ton of individual meshes for parts, and the in-game item determines which collection of meshes (SCOLs are already a thing in Gamebryo after all) make up that weapon. There's gonna be a minimum of 700 meshes in disk here anyway, may as well keep to that minimum."

The big complaint that makes it easy would be that some food items, especially maize, basically make up for the reduced stimpacks. Once you can stack 2 or 3 food items at once that is fast enough healing to have a stimpack like effect.  I'd say Jsawyer + one of the mods that removes healing from food items would do it, and I believe that PN does so."
FalloutMods,3ah78m,mourningyou,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:28:37 2015 UTC,Well...one of the things about Arwen's Tweaks is that when you stimpack or eat...you cannot do anything else...and stimpacks take a long time to heal you.   So those are very different.   Thank you.

Your saves are probably fine. Boot Fo3 through FOSE, instead of the steam launcher though to get around the god awful GFWL."
FalloutMods,3ah55d,Berekhalf,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:45:37 2015 UTC,I think the mod data is stored in a NMM folder. I wonder if it'll work if I make NMM detect the Steam version instead of the crack... I'll try it.   So then will I still have to open Steam to run Fallout? That's what I'm having to do for New Vegas right now. I open Steam but launch through NMM and everything's fine. Or is there a way to launch without opening Steam?
FalloutMods,3ah55d,Berekhalf,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:28:18 2015 UTC,"You can force NMM to rescan games, and you have an option to not go through steam by using Fallout Script Extender, and you might have to if you want to avoid dealing with GFWL and having your saves.

FalloutMods,3ah0sc,PM_ME_UR_BIKE,2,Sat Jun 20 04:00:09 2015 UTC,"How to mod Fallout. Activate all the files you want in whatever odder you want, paying attention to the readme. Run BOSS, attempt to start game. If it fails, run FNVEdit and it will show you if there's a missing master (this is normally the problem). Then rearrange so the missing master is above the plugin that complained bout the missing master(this can be done in NMM). Rerun FNVEdit until it loads your full load order without throwing any hissy fits. If you're still getting weird mod compatibilities, double check the readme for the mod and ensure you've followed all that info.

Mine can't, which is why I don't use any. A lot of people like Nevada Skies to remove the yellow tint, although I've grown quite fond of it.  As you can see, mostly stability upgrades.

Make a backup copy of the original Fallout 3.exe file in the Fallout 3 goty folder. Move Fallout 3.exe to this new folder. Double click START.BAT in this folder. Follow the instructions in the command window. The ""large Address Aware flag in the Fallout 3.exe has now been set. Move this revised version of Fallout 3.exe back into the Fallout 3 goty folder. This utility is used to add the Large Address Aware flag to the Fallout 3 executable. Even though Fallout is a 32 bit program, this flag allows the operating system to use additional address space to support the program. Fallout 3 only allows for 2 GB of RAM to be accessed by ""Fallout3.exe""; this flag will allow up to 4 GB of RAM to be accessed.    Once the utility has run and added the flag, the folder for the utility is no longer needed and can be deleted since there will be no new versions of Fallout 3.exe.  If the OS being used for Fallout is a 64 bit OS no additional steps are needed. If a 32 bit OS is being used, some additional steps might be required depending on the OS being used. Typically no additional steps are needed except for 32 bit Windows XP. Details on this are provided in the READ ME.txt file included with the utility.  Note that having added this flag, the Fallout executable is no longer compatible with Games for Window Live. This is addressed with the next utility.

FalloutMods,3adaf0,TheOptimisticSinner,3,Fri Jun 19 04:29:21 2015 UTC,Much of it is ripped content.
FalloutMods,3adaf0,IAMPOUNDCAKE,3,Fri Jun 19 06:01:21 2015 UTC,"Aware of this. The more and more I flipped through, the more I found stolen content. However, it is great to find the mods since I am unable to find the original. Such as the Metro 2033 armor pack. I'd rather end up getting it from a rehosted area than never having it, to be quite honest. Call me a criminal I suppose. It's unfortunate, but, in the two mods I downloaded, they were nowhere else to be found from doing a quick google search. I'll make the edit in the desc."
FalloutMods,3adaf0,IAMPOUNDCAKE,2,Fri Jun 19 06:03:43 2015 UTC,"For me it depends. Flat ripped content I don't like. Partially because its 'illegal' but mostly because ripped stuff tends to just not fit in the game. Aesthetically, and art wise. There are exceptions. If you take something ripped and remix it, so that it fits that is something else entirely. Much of Dragbody's stuff fits into that category. There are many weapons that do this too, like the Halo Weapons Pack.   Also, many of the mods from that site tend to have problems that you end up needing to fix. Not just translation stuff either. I have had several nifs that you need to fix with Nifskope because texture addresses include the entire hdd location instead of just the folder structure. Also keep in mind that German and Russian versions of the game have some differing formid's. The 'code' for frag grenade is different between the three localizations."

The textures were fine, mesh was fine, no clipping issues. :) But yeah, I see where you're coming from. I did a google search to see if there were similar items or the original, but I could not find it unfortunately."

Sure, the performance is a bit wonky, but I manage to play smoothly 90% of the time.   All I did was follow this sub's 'complete fix guide'.  EDIT: I just saw how heavily modded your game is.

FalloutMods,3ab3nq,elEscobar,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:29:21 2015 UTC,"Haha. Yeah, and I haven't even got everything I want. I think it's either a lighting mod or texture issue.

FalloutMods,3abkwk,SenileDrunk,4,Thu Jun 18 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"We have no idea.   Microsoft is known for acting as though things both will get are exclusive as a marketing tactic, but we don't know. they said they want to bring it to both.   Regardless you can expect mods to be limited. Here are things you likely won't be able to do  Please note this is just speculation based on experience as a content creator, and knowing the general limitations IF they don't go out of their way to make things available they never have before.    Adult mods. Things that add killing children, sexuality, nudity, etc. Essentially anything that would put the rating up. The reason is, these will have to go through Microsoft or Sony. They aren't going to allow things for modding that they wouldn't allow otherwise.  Any mods that add textures that are larger. The Consoles will not be able to handle larger textures without dropping to unplayable framerates.  Likely any mods that edit INI files ( So anything with decay time, blood textures, changing start locations, mods that edit any value really) Anything that will use Fallout 4 script extender. People are debating that they may add enough features to not need it, but this won't be the case. We know what Creation is like for coding. F4SE will give us more options regardless of what Bethesda gives us. This will likely get rid of 25% of mods for people right away.  Mods that require XML files. There goes major overhauls that have menus. Project Nevada, FOOK, MCM, etc.   Higher quality sound mods. If someone wants to do a sound overhaul pack that also increases the size of audio, this adds a lot more ram usage.  Mods with high detail environments. A lot of mods like to go above and beyond the detail level of the Vanilla game. Look at some mods for Fo3 and NV where the rooms are loaded with clutter, are way larger, have more enemies, just...more alive. Every object you add to a room will decrease performance. Mods like this can cripple PCs Obviously things like ENBs will not be useable.    Things we don't know but might be an issue   New files in general. With the way BSA files work, and how the file structure works to replace it with Archive Invalidation, unless this is set up beforehand there will be no way to implement new textures, audio, meshes, models, etc. Now, skyrim had Archive invalidation turned on by default but this still creates issues with file structure Load order. This may be the biggest one. Even the standard launcher has issues with load order. Now you cant use LOOT to organize it, you cant use FNVedit to find missing masters Merged patches. To create a merged patch for console, I guess you would have to download the identical mod list, with an identical load order on PC, and then transfer it over. This may work, but imagine doing this every time you get a new mod or a mod updates. You would also need to own a copy on PC to do this, and I can't see many PC players who mod choosing to play on console when they have both.    I'm sure there are a lot more things to think about, but these are the first that come to mind."
FalloutMods,3abkwk,Cyrus224,2,Thu Jun 18 20:37:07 2015 UTC,As far as I know there will also be mods on PS4 and I have absolutely no idea how Bethesda plans on allowing their integration into the game.

FalloutMods,3aak9n,straydog13,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:16:52 2015 UTC,"Well you're going to have a bad day, since you're basically asking for someone to point you at ripped assets.  Best you could do legally would be to acquire a physical copy of the disc, and install a windows VM on your Mac. Install the game inside the VM, extract the files (They're all .nifs, you'll be able to find plenty of tutorials on manipulating .nifs if you google.) and go from there. Theoretically I guess you could also get it through Steam, and install Steam in the VM."

FalloutMods,3aak9n,Ophichius,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:34:50 2015 UTC,"Is there some specific asset you're looking for? Practically every asset in the game has a few screenshots on Google you should be able to extrapolate from. And given how blocky the models are, I doubt actually being able to pose them is going to give you much in the way of additional material to work with, unless you're deliberately trying to re-create the look of the game instead of going for a realistic look."
FalloutMods,3aak9n,Ophichius,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:36:37 2015 UTC,"Well they're no good for illustration, but I also add draftsmanship to them and add in a lot more volume than the game has. BUT having models I can access, rotate and pose help speed things up considerably if you know what I mean   *plus it just helps for knowing what details are where"

FalloutMods,3a9vnw,Ophichius,4,Thu Jun 18 11:54:26 2015 UTC,It's a standalone but the author also gave permission to integrate it into PNV. So...yes.

FalloutMods,3aa32n,lunshbox,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:52:41 2015 UTC,"No worries my friend. First, download LOOT and use that to sort your load order. FNVEdit can only tell you so much. It doesn't do a lot to tell you if your load order is correct. Secondly, after sorting your load order properly, open up FNVEdit, let everything load properly. After that is done, right click in the left window, go down to ""Other"", then click on ""Create Merged Patch"". Name it something like ""My Merged Patch"" or whatever you like. After it finishes creating the patch, close out FNVEdit. When it gives you the option to save the file, make sure the merged patch is the only thing selected.  If using Mod Organizer, right click on the overwrite folder and click ""Create mod"". Name it Merged Patch. Make sure it's at the bottom of your load order. If using NMM or FOMM, just make sure the created merged patch is at the bottom of your load order.  PROFIT."

FalloutMods,3a9oc6,EnderPig,2,Thu Jun 18 09:43:57 2015 UTC,"The Someguy Series are the most popular quest mods and probably the most lore friendly. They fit right into the game. Download that file and the first 4 he links to on that page.   Project Nevada for gameplay features. It's an overhaul mod. You can set a preset if you don't want to mess with it, and keep vanilla gameplay if you like. Mostly it adds more implants, a sprint key, a grenade hotkey, and spread visuals for guns. Also get whatever patches apply to you and the extra options plugin.  More perks for more perks.  Weaposn of the new Millennium and weapon mods expanded for new weapons.   Extended crafting for more survival and science recopies.   Niner or Delilah if you want a new companion. Delilah also has an alternate voice pack that you'll definitely want.   JIP Companion command and control makes companions a lot more useful and easier to control.  Wave Radio, Conelrad and/or Mojave Music Radio Extended for a lot more music.  Digital Nightmare is an audio overhaul (not a new station). See for yourself if you like it or not, it's much more dramatic and hard than vanilla.   Spice of Life for more variety in clothing, especially among NPCs. All of this guy's armor packs if you want new armor.   NCR rearmament if you want the NCR to feel like a real military. Check out the rextexture too for a more vanilla style.   Caesar's New Regime does the same for legion, and you should use both mods side by side. This one also adds a lot of new content the legion was lacking.   Gun mod behavior merge is a collection of mods that make gunplay more realistic, all in one mod. You can disable any features you don't like if you want a less hardcore playthrough.   What else are you looking for? I can recommend more of each type if that's not enough. These are just the most popular mods.   EDIT: You'll also need 4GB loader and NVSE. Be sure to read closely and install them correctly, they're a bit different than normal mods."
FalloutMods,3a9oc6,rocktheprovince,3,Thu Jun 18 10:05:20 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Yukichigai's Unofficial Patch and Mission Mojave Ultimate Edition (I think there's a compatability patch for them), as well as JSawyer's mod, although it could make things slightly more difficult than you might like.  To make the game slightly more realistic physics-wise, I'd recommend Precision Collision.  CASM is a save manager that works far better than the base game one, but for that you'll need the NVSE (New Vegas Script Extender) and the Mod Configuration Menu. If you're going to start getting more mods later, those two will be essential later on as well.  NVAC (New Vegas anti-crash) and the New Vegas stutter remover are (as far as I can remember) both NVSE plugins, and they will make your playtime much less buggy/horrible.  Another NVSE plugin that will save you frustration is OneTweak NV, which makes it so you can run your game in borderless windowed mode, so you don't have to wait for the load screen and can instantly alt-tab at will.  Also, I would recommend using Mod Organizer rather than FOMM, as FOMM will directly change your base files, whereas Mod Organizer stores your mods in separate folders and is less likely to cause something catastrophic.   Feel free to PM me if you want more advice, and remember that these are just my recommendations."
FalloutMods,3a9oc6,Talpanian_Emperor,2,Thu Jun 18 10:02:49 2015 UTC,"Great list.  YUP and Jsawyer are great for a ""ultimate edition"" playthrough.  Also I'd add DarnUI to that list."
FalloutMods,3a9oc6,gyshall,2,Thu Jun 18 13:55:19 2015 UTC,So does that mean I shouldn't install MMUE?
FalloutMods,3a9oc6,gyshall,2,Thu Jun 18 16:23:03 2015 UTC,"No, I wouldn't.  MMUE changes a ton of stuff and YUP is more of a vanilla-friendly bugfix patch."

FalloutMods,3a5y8l,jettj12,17,Wed Jun 17 14:15:00 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking that they would need to make a built in script extended.   Also, since they say they won't really moderate the mods, does this mean kill able children for all platforms?"
FalloutMods,3a5y8l,TheWanderingDinosuar,26,Wed Jun 17 17:38:03 2015 UTC,"The reason they need to moderate nudity and adult content is because it would raise the game's rating to AO from the ESRB. I don't know the exact rules of the rating system off hand, but I would venture to guess that having killable children in your game gets you an automatic AO rating as well. So I think it's safe to say that killable children won't be a feature that's allowed."

FalloutMods,3a5y8l,Hometown_Monster,11,Thu Jun 18 00:56:59 2015 UTC,"Thats only because the textures were still on the disc. Similar to the Hot Coffee San Andreas fiasco, the Adult content was already in the game it just needed to be accessed by a third party mod."

The ESRB cited the presence of content not considered in their original review in the published edition of Oblivion. This included detailed depictions of blood and gore and sexually explicit content. The sexually explicit content was an art file, made accessible by a third-party modification called the Oblivion Topless Mod, that rendered the game with topless female characters.

FalloutMods,3a5y8l,sudoku7,2,Wed Jun 17 20:04:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I was just using the ESRB as an example of how there are external parties forcing Bethesda hand of content curating. Also I just don't think that Microsoft would be willing to openly support mods like that. Knowing that anything going to the consoles has to be vetted means that anything released somewhat has a joint Microsoft-Bethesda Seal of Approval.
FalloutMods,3a5y8l,Hometown_Monster,2,Wed Jun 17 20:34:11 2015 UTC,Couldn't they treat it they same way as online interactions? On all games with online features that they are either unrated or not rated.

It sounds like it's specifically a hosting service they're providing and which is accessible through the console version, due to how locked down consoles are.

FalloutMods,3a85y6,wertwert55,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:58:36 2015 UTC,"About the black textures, i had something similar happen to me, not quite as bad tho. I fixed it by installing the Fallout New Vegas 4 GB executable. I know it looks like a lot of work for it to run properly but its really not, and definitly worth the time. Watch the Youtube tutorial on how to install (There is 2 versions of the 4GB available on the Nexus,be sure to take the Updated one). Maybe this will fix the multiple pictures too. Good Luck"

FalloutMods,3a85y6,autfag,3,Thu Jun 18 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, 4 GB fixed the issue. Thanks a bunch, I'm assuming it means it was a memory issue."
FalloutMods,3a85y6,xray2,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:29:52 2015 UTC,"Yes it was definitly a memory issue, the vanilla exe handles memory usage terribly. Very well, glad you can enjoy your game now :)"

FalloutMods,3a7gvo,WildfireDarkstar,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"Ahem... http://pastebin.com/pW3yLDT6  Anything prefixed with a ""+"" is currently active, anything with a ""-"" is disabled and imported to the bashed patch, so that's 130 active plugins, 164 total plugins. It includes a lot of mods I've merged manually using FNVEdit (""Radio Station Mods - Merged.esp,"" ""TTW_MergedPluginsAndPatches,"" etc.), since the game starts running into stability issues whenever I have more than 132 active plugins. A couple of the Fallout 3 mods were self-converted to TTW. Everything has been tested at length (I've played through all of Fallout 3 and most of New Vegas, over 200 hours so far). Also running the NVSE memory patch and an ENB (though I forget which one, honestly). I'm using NMC's combined texture pack, but only the smallest size available. Oh, and there's a FNVEdit merged patch in there, too, itself merged into the bashed patch (which is very likely redundant, but, eh, it's not hurting anything, either).  Not using LOOT is a terrible idea, honestly. You should have a general idea of what your load order should look like, and be comfortable using FNVEdit to verify that things aren't conflicting (and to make patches, if necessary), but manually sorting 120+ plugins isn't silly, and far more likely to cause problems than relying on LOOT."
FalloutMods,3a8mk6,AndaleTheGreat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 02:23:42 2015 UTC,You have FWE - Project Beauty without having Project Beauty OR FWE. Archive invalidation is under the spanner and screwdriver. Toggle it a few times and make sure it's ticked.

FalloutMods,3a83el,Supersonicmario1,2,Wed Jun 17 23:36:41 2015 UTC,"I'll help you out since I had this problem recently and the mod author hardly makes it clear.   Install FCO (fallout character overhaul) NVR 3 uses some of FCO's assets. keeping FCO installed, uncheck any FCO.esp or .esm in your load order Install NVR3 overwriting any files it asks, and put it at very bottom of your load order.  make sure to uncheck and re-check archive invalidation in your mod manager. if it's messed up check and double check everything to see if you need compatibility patches.    Next time click on the ""posts"" tab on the nexus mod and read through the help threads there. That's where I got this exact info when I was having trouble installing NVR3. Happy modding!"
