I read through the full article and there are quite a few pull quotes that have appeared out of context. Shame on the reporter. I'm not professional reporter, but even I know that quotes like that would be ammo for those who are desperately grasping for eyeballs.  Perhaps the reporter did this because Natalie dared to record her own audio of the interview? As if the reporter was saying ""I don't need to change your words to twist them!""  I don't know if the Hollywood Reporter ever had a reputation of being classy, but they certainly should not after this article."

natalieportman,2stdq1,AgtFoxMulder,4,Sun Jan 18 13:42:51 2015 UTC,The stunt butt was during the dive. This part is all her.

FUCK, I'D LOVE TO HIT THAT SHIT.""   I get why it might have weirded her out, after doing something she considered being for the sake of ""art,"" but she's too smart to assume that guys wouldn't be feeling a bit of a tingle downstairs when they saw it."

natalieportman,2stdq1,Robbomot,2,Sun Jan 18 21:03:15 2015 UTC,I'm going to up vote you BUT the underwear in the trailer is bright red: it looks to me as though the trailer was editted for general audiences as opposed to the scene in the movie being editted for perverts; it is much easier to add underwear to a half naked body than to photoshop another person's butt into a movie.  What would be the point?

natalieportman,2rc647,watchova,2,Tue Jan 6 01:24:38 2015 UTC,There were candids of her on set at least two years ago.  Very memorable.
natalieportman,2rc647,ekiqa,2,Tue Jan 6 04:38:42 2015 UTC,I was there for that game. Pretty sure the entire stadium was a fan when they put her on the big screen.
