The uniqid function doesn't create truly random or unpredictable strings so maybe you're supposed to exploit that instead of bypass it.  Do you have any other information that would help us help you?
HowToHack,3dueng,soloplate,2,Sun Jul 19 18:32:31 2015 UTC,"According to the admins:   The statement for this challenge is: Spot the bug and get the flag! The flag has the following format: flag{something}. The challenge can be solved through code analysis and exploitation, without using any brute-force approach.   I'm only trying to read /etc/password to see whether or not I can access local files, as I have no idea where to look for the flag.  The other (non-web) challenges I have solved so far had the flags hidden in:   a password-protected .zip some random file in a router's firmware an ELF 32-bit LSB executable file   I'm guessing the file containing the flag is not in some obscure location. The hard part probably lies in accessing local files.  EDIT: I know that the page's location (found through an error) is /var/www/html/web1/index.php. This is where I would try looking."
HowToHack,3dueng,soloplate,2,Sun Jul 19 18:52:20 2015 UTC,"The index.php file is probably just the page you're already on...  Usually CTF web challenges give you a lot of information. Did you check robots.txt to see if there's a file or something you're not allowed to access?  Based on the information you've given, I'm fairly convinced that you're supposed to find the name of the flag file and force a collision with the insecure uniqid calls. Maybe the way they've constructed the challenge doesn't allow you to access any given local file, but only one that matches a possible output of uniqid.  I would poke around more in the web app and try to find a target to use the uniqid vulnerability against.  Is this a public CTF?"

The attacker can capture packets even if they aren't authenticated to the access point.   The only way an attack could steal credentials would be if you pass them in clear text (Do not use any form of encryption to login).   The access password is vulnerable to brute force attacks and is weak.  As far as mac spoofing I'm not a network engineer so I can't speak too much on protection of that but what I can say is that if two machines share one mac address on the same network there will be conflicts and it won't really be possible to download terrabytes of anything.

Some solutions don't block certain ports like 22 that can be used to tunnel traffic out via SOCKS proxy.  Need to make sure that is locked down.  There are many ways around a basic captive portal. I could even do a phishing attack if I really wanted with ARP spoofing if there isn't client isolation.  If you're really worried about it, I would hire a pen-tester.

HowToHack,3drsl2,cillian13,13,Sat Jul 18 20:59:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, so based on your questions it's very obvious that you don't know much about computers at all. That's fine though. There's a lot to learn.   The first thing about ""hacking"" that's misunderstood is that you can ""learn how to hack"". You don't really just learn how to hack. There are numerous fields within computer security. And since the industry is always changing, you are literally learning something new every day. For some reason people assume that ""hacking"" is easy. It's extremely difficult and requires an insane amount of knowledge and intellect. First off, Linux isn't a language, it's an operating system. Programming languages are created for various purposes. JavaScript is mostly used in web development, while something like C is mainly used for systems programming. There are a multitude of languages, some are made to perform a specific task, others to make programming easier, and some are able to wear multiple hats. People have preferences. Some people think PHP looks ugly so they don't want to use it, and others think that Ruby has too much ""magic"" so they'd prefer to use PHP. So new languages are being created all the time. A general rule of thumb is that you don't talk about anything illegal that you do. That's how you get caught. It happens all the time. Some script kiddie defaces a school website or something and then brags online. Police show up at his house a few days later. There are some specific sites where people talk about illicit activity, one of them (Darkode) just got taken down by the feds. Being able to understand different syntaxes might help with learning programming languages, but learning programming languages is actually very easy if you already know how to program. Using programming languages efficiently requires a certain frame of mind and excellent problem solving skills.   If you're interested in computer security, you really should at least learn how to program first. You can't really just jump into learning ""how to hack"". Check out Codecademy and learn some Python."

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks generally employ a large amount of computers owned by unwilling/unwitting participants.  These are called zombies.  At the time of the attack, these ""zombies"" may be directed to all access a website or other public-facing service at one time.  A company like Amazon can handle that many hits at one time; smaller companies can not.  This is a very basic explanation, but I hope it helps."
HowToHack,3dp2ey,kschmidt62226,3,Sat Jul 18 03:39:25 2015 UTC,"Vulnerability Analysis  I know that it revolves around finding weaknesses in a website's security and exploiting them (like SQL injection), but I don't know how people would find these faults and then go about exploiting them... How would you look for a flaw and then exploit it?  http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Vulnerability_Analysis  This site gives a pretty good overview of the methods used to discover many types of vulnerabilities. For example, to discover web application vulnerabilities (e.g. SQL injection), you might use a process like this:   Most web application scans start with the address of a website, web application, or web service. The scanner then crawls the site by following links and directory structures. After compiling a list of webpages, resources, services and/or other media offered, the scanner will perform tests, or audits against the results of the crawl. For example, if a webpage discovered in the crawl has form fields, the scanner might attempt SQL injection or cross-site scripting. If the crawled page contained errors, the scanner might look for sensitive information displayed in the error detail, and so on.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMG5_SP61t8  This is an example of someone finding and exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability.  DoS  Also, how do people DoS servers, especially DDoS? I know how the principals work, but I don't quite understand how hacktivist groups such as anonymous go about doing it.  https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-Anonymous-hacker-group-DDOS-such-a-large-website-such-as-Mastercard-Visa-Amazon  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Orbit_Ion_Cannon  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Orbit_Ion_Cannon  Anonymous uses a combination of botnets and volunteer machines to perform DDoS attacks. Typically a small number of users initiate the attack using a botnet that they control. Once the attack has been started, other members participate by downloading a simple tool (e.g. LOIC and HOIC) and running it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Attack_techniques  There are many ways to perform a denial of service attack. Wikipedia's ""Denial-of-service attack"" page lists several techniques.  For more info...  Software just interests me, and I am really curious as to how hacking actually works.  https://www.reddit.com/r/securityctf  If you're interested in learning more, I would highly recommend looking for CTF (capture the flag) challenges. These are exercises that simulate the process of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in a safe (and legal) environment."

HowToHack,3djlxf,omglazerzpewpew,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:26:40 2015 UTC,"Awesome.  Thanks for the ideas everybody – I’ve done some testing and gotten it to work in a pretty unrecognizable way. In case anybody else wants/needs to do this, or in case I need to remember how in the future – here is the basics.   I watched the Nathan For You clip mentioned below, and in addition to being very funny, they dev’s explanation was pretty helpful.  For my purpose, I used the site https://emkei.cz/ to craft the message.  First thing, it appears that using a legitimate trusted FROM email address will cause the message to go directly to inbox no matter what type of SPAM bait I put in the subject or body of the message.  The mailer allows a separate from and reply address, which I think is nice, because when he replies, it will come to me, and not cause suspicion. So, From Address MYEMAIL@GMAIL.C0M  Next, in the advanced settings I put my real email as the reply address Reply address MYEMAIL@GMAIL.COM   (see the o instead of 0 in C0M vs COM)  I know that’s not going to fool somebody smart looking for a problem, but I know he’s a dimwit and I don’t expect he’ll even look for a problem….  Next I marked the message as High importance.  The site gave a warning that may get it filtered as spam…good I Say!  I picked “The Bat!” as my X-Mailer.  I have no idea what that means, but again the site warned me it could trigger spam, so I’m on board.  I would have liked to route it off an abused Foreign SMTP server, but I couldn’t find any listings that would work.  If you know of some please let me know, I do love the best possible solution, even if this one already works.  I then used the HTML editor to typed my message – I tried to work in as many ‘Spammy’ words as I could initially, but it really isn’t needed.   Plus ""I wish you would stop being such a Nigerian Price and Respond Now and exchange of days so our Young Girl can Take Advantage of a week at Camp.  Don't Delay, Act Now!.  IT's Free!"" seemed a little over the top...  I tried another suggestions from the replies below using the old ‘Rick Roll’ link trick.  I went in my own junk email and found a message for Viagra and copied the link they wanted me to click and displayed it as “Sent from My Iphone” But in my tests, that didn’t work.  In addition it would have been visible, and looked odd since I have the “Sent From my Iphone” footer turned off.  Plus, although it would have been funny if he did click it, I think the jig would have been up.  However the suggestion did put me on the right track.  I did a little more digging concerning adding 'invisible' text to an HTML email and settled on adding a 'hidden' script tag.  After typing my message I hit the Tools dropdown on the HTML Editor and picked Source Code.  Then I inserted a script tag like this:    <script hidden="""" type=""text/plain"">// <![CDATA[ Metric Shit Ton of SPAM Keywords // ]]></script>  I googled ‘Ultimate List Of Spam Keywords” and pasted them all in there.  It looks ridiculous, when you know where to look, but it is not obvious in the actual message.  I have a Hotmail account already, so I added my Gmail account to the contacts, as that was the reply-to address.  I then sent a dozen or so emails back and forth to simulate having a correspondence history, as I don’t regularly use both account, and I never email myself, because well who would….  I also sent a half dozen or so failed attempts from source to target account before I found the magic formula to get routed to spam.  I sent the message, went into my Junk folder on my Hotmail.  Success!  What’s better, the message looks perfectly normal in outlook (web).  You need to work a little bit to find that script tag in the message source, which is something I’m doubtful he will do.  It occurred to me as I was recapping here, I could add several script tags, and put a page of two of actual java script from websites in there so it looks like code and then either sand witch or sprinkle in all my spam words in that code.  That would take some more effort and I’ve got to get this email out the door, wish me luck!   And thanks again for the help!"

HowToHack,3djlxf,DragonyFire,3,Thu Jul 16 20:28:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, so how about if I get a new email address.  Should not be a problem, I think 'my old email got hacked' and/or 'I hate Yahoo's app on my phone'  Under that circumstance is it possible to entice hotmail to mark the email as junk?  A bit of backstory - My deadbeat dad of an ex is a royal asshole and will not modify his visitation by 1 day so the my daughter can go to summer camp.  I have full custody and every right to send her, save interfering with this visitation.  She was crushed that she will miss camp this year, and as much as it would please me, I'm not willing to paint him as an asshole to her by saying you can't go because your dad is a jerk.  Yet again I need to be the bigger person.  That said, I'm also a parent and hate to see so much pointless dissapointment from my daughter, so I've already decided that I'm going to send her anyway, I'm just looking for a way to manufacture a little 'missunderstanding' in case he decides to try and drag it into court.    We have a clause in our custody agreement that saying any visitation change needs to be sent in writing (but necessarily from a specific email address), and if the other party does not respond in 24 hours then they agree by default.    And just to be clear, I'm not taking any time away from him, I'm just moving the time he would see her from Saturday - when she would desperatley like to be at camp, to Sunday when she is back from camp.  Additionally I clearly understand what I'm doing is shady, I fully expect a judge would see right through it if it comes to that.  However the ex is such a giant tool, I feel that if I give the court the flimsiest of argument/reason to rule against him they will.  'I just sent her anyway' puts me in a much worse light than 'Wow, I'm really sorry, I sent him an email but apparently his account marked it as spam so when I didn't hear from him daughter and I were both really excited that she could go to camp... what an unfortunate misunderstanding!'    Ultimatley, I'm willing to face the music if they don't see it my way anyway - the whole situation is absurd....."

HowToHack,3dhaoa,Bigandsmallwooty,18,Thu Jul 16 07:11:04 2015 UTC,"Web site hacking is about finding vulnerabilities and figuring out how to exploit them. Pretend you're trying to break into a building. First, how do people normally get in to the building? Do they use a key? Is there a password? What are the operating hours? How many doors does the building have, how many windows? There are many potential ways to break into a building, and they all require specific knowledge of the buildings construction and what the building is used for. The more you know about the building the easier it is to break in.  Websites are similar. If you are trying to access a passworded area you should know how passwords are stored and verified. If you're trying to access a server the website is connected to you need to know how they talk to each other. The more familiar you are with the way websites are built the easier it will be to figure out how to break them. The issue is that websites, and the framework supporting them, are built with dozens of different protocols and languages. Don't try to learn them all at once. HTML and JavaScript is a good place to start. Learn how they work and learn how they break. If you get bored with that switch to another language and repeat. Find a specific area that interests you and stick with that. You'll pick the rest up along the way."

HowToHack,3dgiz7,beno696,5,Thu Jul 16 09:00:00 2015 UTC,"EDIT: Sorry, I'm on mobile so the better linking system isn't going to work here.  There isn't one way to hack, it would get secured and hacking would be over. Also, use your skills on devices you own,  yap yap, I'm not responsible for your actions, yap yap. Without further delay, here's my response:  As someone who is still in the early stages of the learning process, but successfully started (I think) I can offer some advice: just start. Learn about how computers work and then start thinking about how you might exploit that on a basic level and then how you would go about patching it. Learn as much as you can. I started off by watching TechQuickie to learn the basics of computing (Link #1) and googled any questions. I then started off into the wonderful world of programming, using the Python3 programming language (Link#2). After this (about a 6 month gap here) I built my very first computer. You wouldn't have to do this, because it's expensive, but I needed a new one anyways so I figured what the hell, right? At the very least you could watch a build guide and learn (Link #3). Start learning some networking with your programming and think about how you might go about making your own tools. Stack Overflow is your best friend here and they have a lot of previously answered questions to help, as well as an easy way to ask your own (Link #4). If you really get into programming (specifically Python) then sentdex on YouTube is super helpful (Link #5). Some will say that Python isn't the best language, and they might be right. However, the point of programming is to get you thinking and to expand your 'toolkit'. This combined had me way more informed about how stuff works than I was to begin with and set me on the right path.   I hope this helps you out, /u/Raddud3  EDIT: WAIT!!! I just realized that I never mentioned pre-made tools! Ask on this subreddit for tools to get the job done, but I find making my own to be more rewarding :)  LINK 1: https://m.youtube.com/user/Techquickie LINK 2: https://www.python.org LINK 3: http://youtu.be/vbDiSMQ_L_k LINK 4: http://stackoverflow.com LINK 5: https://m.youtube.com/user/sentdex  List of things that are helpful but I didn't have time to talk about because yeah:  Raspberry Pi (mini computer, super helpful) Kali Linux (doesn't matter if a virtual machine or not) Tor/a proxy (for privacy and security) A person to bounce ideas off of (extremely valuable!)  EDIT 2: Okay, I found some time and I can expand on the list above. I should also mention that when I say 'distro' I mean distribution, or different version. I would also like to apologize if this seems like I over-explained some things but I assumed that you didn't know any of this and that if you did then you could gloss over those parts.  The newest (model 2B) Raspberry Pi is a credit-card sized, ~$50 mini computer with a 1GHz quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM. It can run almost all distros of the free operating system, Linux. It can also run Windows 10. This is helpful because it can be used as a portable Linux system and also can fit in many machines. It has several GPIO (general purpose input output) pins that you can attach things to that allow the Pi to interact with other devices. Some people use it to control their home temperatures. Others make automated instrument players. The amount of projects in infinite and the website (Link #6) is very helpful. There are tons of tutorials online for projects and Make Magazine (Link #7) seems to love the damn thing!  Kali Linux is one of the above mentioned 'distros' except it specializes in ethical hacking tools. There are a lot of tools that come with the distro but it is also super easy to install more. I don't want to confuse and or bore you to death, but you can run a virtual machine (a computer on a computer, sort of) OR use the Raspberry Pi. If you have trouble with this, message me and I will personally guide you through, although I love VMWare (Link #8).  With Tor and a Proxy, I don't actually know how they work. I know that Tor connects you through multiple places and is a secure way to browse the Internet, but I have never used a proxy. This part would be better suited for someone more experienced than myself. I CAN, however, point you to the Tor download (Link #9)  And now, finally, a person to bounce ideas off of that knows more than you. This has proved to be by FAR the most useful thing to have. They can correct you when you are wrong, and push you further when you are right. Trust me, it will take a very long time to be right about stuff. That's okay though, it's part of the learning process! I have given you my knowledge on the subject so maybe pick someone that isn't me :)  Link 6: https://www.raspberrypi.org Link 7: http://makezine.com Link 8: https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_player/7_0 Link 9: https://torproject.org/download  Also the TAILS operating system is quite useful to put on a flash drive.

HowToHack,3daqls,DragonyFire,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:23:23 2015 UTC,"""Internetz""? An online attack would be ""online"", in the sense that you are connected to another machine. An example of an online attack would be attacking the connection between someone and their router.  A good example of an offline attack would be brute forcing the wpa2 handshake. What this is is when someone connects to a router that has a password, the device and the router exchange information in a process called the handshake.  Any modern router has security that tries to prevent someone from brute forcing the router itself. If it sees someone sending thousands of passwords to it, it will block them.  An easy way around this is to watch for someone to connect to the router and capture all of the traffic involved in the handshake. Then you save that data into a file on your computer, and then you begin brute forcing it offline. The rest of the attack will take place on your machine, with a program comparing pre-made handshakes to the one you captured. Once you get a match, you know what the password is."

You may have a device powerful enough to be heard miles away, but not sensitive enough to hear others miles away. you  need to essentially make a point to point link. you would need highly directional equipment on both sides, that are aimed at each other.  These should work well for you and are rather inexpensive. the biggest obstacle you may have is finding someone down the mountain that will allow you to set up an antenna to point back at you. if you find this, you should be OK. for the range you are talking about, and the fact that you have a clear line of sight, those dishes i linked earlier would work well for you, and are stupid easy to set up.  the next biggest thing to consider is frequency. 2.4 should work well for you, but is not the best option if there is already a bunch of 2.4 in the area making the spectrum noisy. basically, is there a heavy saturation of wifi between you and them? if not, 2.4 is fine. 5 ghz will be quieter, but doesn't travel through obstacles nearly as well, but can travel farther. 900 mhz isn't something i'd suggest unless you are more experienced in this. two of the AG-HP-2G16's that i linked earlier should be all you need. they cost about $70 USD each"

HowToHack,3d6vj0,ran-koon,15,Tue Jul 14 00:02:55 2015 UTC,"I will try and give an extremely brief overview of this, as I'm no expert--or even close for that matter.   Let's think about some things first; namely ip address and mac address. You can think about the IP address as your house address, where you and your family live; thus, there's multiple people living at this address. However, if someone wants to send you say a package (packet of information) they need to address to a very specific person whom lives in that house. This is completely possible, because everyone in the house is known by a unique name  (no name is the same, in theory), this can be thought of as the MAC Address (A unique name that no one else has, in the world and house).  Information doesn't travel through every router in the world. You can see this for yourself:  1) open up terminal/cmd prompt 2) type ""tracerout www.reddit.com"" without the quotes. You'll see it go through a couple of routers, not all in the world.   The route the packet(s) takes is determined by an algorithm, which looks for the lowest metric; namely, like golf, lower the score the better. This all happens extremely fast, which is really kewl. Essentially, routing is act of finding the best path based on algorithm that routers share between each other, which helps determine the best route take (lowest score = route to take).   Default Gateway, this is a bit trickier to explain from analogy; however, I'll try by continuing our house example. Your mailbox essentially acts like a default gateway; namely, it allows you to send information outside your house, that's pretty much it. It really is just a protocol that allows you to send information to other addresses, allows you to mail things out just like a mailbox does.   MAC Address: 00-0F-B5-45-96-A4  (hexadecimal representation)  Ip address could be IPv4 or IPv6:   IPv6: 3ffe:1900:4545:3:200:f8ff:fe21:67cf  IPv4: 172.16.254.1  Default: Looks pretty much the same as IPv4. Typically, they look very much alike with only the last 2 digits being different.   Last but not least, DNS (Domain Name Service) can be thought of as the yellow pages of the internet. So when you look up  ""Better Call Saul"" you look for letters/phrases in the phone book, which then translates your language into a number to contact Saul. This is pretty much how it works-ish. You type in www.whatever.com which then is translated into an IPv4/6 (The phone number), which allows you contact whatever/whoever."

I kinda knew most of this but you just made it like 80% clearer ,  sorry to make you type this much :D , you explained everything, don't know how to repay you :( . Thank you very much again !!!!  EDIT : I have a question, what is the normal amount of HOPs when the Internet protocol is trying to route to your MAC address and just to be sure , regarding your house analogy the MAC address is the physical address of your computer , but what does the house(the IP ) represent there ? I think the IP in your analogy represents my house network to which more devices can be connected (and then every device has a MAC address and all have the same IP ) but not too sure about that ."

Yes, MAC address is your physical unchanging address  (i.e. your name you go by in your house, in theory). The IP (House) is where everyone lives (All devices that connect to the internet). IP addresses come and go all the time that's 'why' they're not unchanging; namely, you can move from house to another house. I'm glad it helped, and that I could be of some service to you.

HowToHack,3d6vj0,nbiz4,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:48:56 2015 UTC,Read into my comment below about the OSI model. Then read more into that by using Google to search for further explanations. It's real important to understand the OSI model.
HowToHack,3d6vj0,Howcanshes1ap,5,Tue Jul 14 12:05:00 2015 UTC,"How young/old are you out of curiosity?  Ok, here is a basic explanation of what you are looking for:  When you say that ""most routers have an IP of 192.168.x.x"", what they are referring to is what is called an ""Internal IP Address Range"" or aka, ""IPv4 Private IP Address Range.""  What that means is that there are certain IP Address ranges that are specifically reserved for internal networks only. Such as home, office, corporate places, and such. That's why all your home routers are like, 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.2.1, for example. You try typing that into your web browser at home, it will just bring up your home router's interface login page, that's it.  Modern routers have a feature called NAT, which is abbreviated for ""Network Address Translating.""   ""Network address translation (NAT) is a methodology of remapping one IP address space into another by modifying network address information in Internet Protocol (IP) datagram packet headers while they are in transit across a traffic routing device."" (Got this from Google itself.)  So on the REAL, open world Internet, there are no websites or anything that correlates to 192.168.0.0/16, because we all agreed that IP range will be reserved for private use only. Same goes with 172.16.0.0/16 and 10.0.0.0/8. (Don't worry about the /8, /16, /24, and so forth, that you will learn about subnetting when you get into more intermediate-advanced networking, if you get that far.)  In the world of TCP/IP, there is what is called, the OSI model. Which stands for ""Open Systems Interconnection model."" It is comprised of 7 layers.*** This is basically how all the different things, such as IP Addresses, MAC Addresses, wifi/ethernet, and all that stuff you were asking about, work together. The seven layers are as follows (write this down):  Layer 1-Physical Layer: This is where the ""zeroes"" and the ""ones"" exist, travelling down the actual ethernet wire, that's why it's called ""Physical Layer."" (If you have wifi, this would be the radio waves on the 2.4GHz/5GHz band itself.)  Layer 2-Data Link Layer: This layer is where MAC Addresses live and work. MAC Addresses are the actual, physical, hard-coded address that is assigned to that NIC (Network Interface Card), where the ethernet connects into your Xbox/Playstation/PC/etc. If you have wifi, this would be the MAC Address of just the wireless card in your computer/device. Your actual ethernet will have it's own, different MAC Address.  FUN FACTS: The MAC Address can tell you a lot about a device as a hacker. All REAL authentic MAC Addresses are comprised of integers 0-9, and alphabet characters from A-F. If you see a letter past ""F"" in the sequence in a MAC Address, it's obviously fake. (The only place you will ever see a fake MAC is on a networking written certification test/exam.)  AB:CD:EF:12:34:56 would be a real authentic MAC Address, if you ever come across it in real life. If you look at the MAC Address I just sampled, you'll see it's made of 6 hexadecimal characters with the first three being: AB, CD, and EF. If you ever run the first three digits of a MAC Address into a Google search, it will tell you the manufacturer (HP, Dell, etc.) of that network interface device, and possibly of that entire computer, assuming it is an OEM build.  Layer 3-Network Layer: This is where IP addresses live, work, and play.  Layer 4-Transport Layer: TCP vs UDP.  Layer 5-Session Layer: Research yourself.  Layer 6-Presentation Layer: Research yourself.  Layer 7-Application Layer: Research yourself.  Default Gateway is a term designated to the main routing device in an organization (or home/office), that exists between the organization, and the rest of the world, essentially. So your Default Gateway is typically 192.168.1.1 (for example), if you are at home.  Do you understand this a little bit more now? Do you understand why it is important to learn the basics, before you can actually start hacking anything?  ***(8 layers if you're cool like me and have been working in IT for a good period. lol!)  A lot of this doesn't even begin to cover everything, so obviously, there is a lot that I left out, because it's 1:51am where I am, and I don't want to go into anymore details about TCP/IP right now.  Source: I did 5-6 years in the US Army as a Radioman, and a systems/network administrator for unclassified and classified networks and systems. Got out of the military and went to work for a Managed Services Provider, basically functioning as a full fledged IT department for small, medium, and large organizations. I was certified in some Microsoft certifications, got Network+, Security+, and had hands on experience and knowledge in Linux, so I went and did the Offensive Security course, ""Penetration Testing with Backtrack 5"" (now Kali Linux), and had a blast during the 60-90 course. (It was all hands on approach to hacking, and some of the shit you learn in that course, is just fucking absolutely mind bending. Some things I did not even know was possible as a IT guy/hacker/techie.) Now I am going back to college full time (not working in IT for now) to become a full fledged programmer for now. So I know a little bit about this stuff."
HowToHack,3d6vj0,marcmc1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:34:15 2015 UTC,"I also forgot to mention something rather important. It's about how Layer 2 and Layer 3 interact with each other through a REALLY REALLY EASILY exploitable process known as ""Address Resolution Protocol."" Also known as ARP.  Your Network Interface Card's (NIC) MAC Address is tied to an IP Address, by the home router, and then stored in a table, which you can manage. The reason it's routed is because your router has to know which IP is assigned to what device on any given network, and using ARP to ""soft-bind"" an IP address to a MAC address is an easy way to do that.  I can show you how to do a simple Man In The Middle attack using Wireshark, a hex editor, and any basic Linux distribution, it's that easy.  Just thought I'd include that."

HowToHack,3d6vj0,rcorkum,4,Tue Jul 14 12:33:47 2015 UTC,"I would recommend looking up the first ccna course training, namely videos/slides that go through the course fundamentals.  Basically you have the an IP address, that has 4 octects, or groupings, 1.2.3.4, think of it like a street address. Subnet masks work like a zip code and are always associated with an IP address, or with your street address, to give it meaning (street addresses are not accurate without a zip code).  An IP address has four classes, A, B, C, D.   That divide addresses in blocks.. B/c we only have a finite amount of addresses, 0.0.0.0 - 255.255.255.255, came up with a concept of private addessing via NAT, that takes usually class B addresses you buy from an ISP when you buy Internet from them, and you router does NAT, buy splitting that one IP into a pool of usable adresses in that LAN, but when a request/packet leaves your router, the default gateway(only device in a LAN capable of going out.. Ex: router), it uses that public IP your ISP gave you. Private IPs thus only have meaning in a local LAN. A IP a host is trying to route to in another network, will be routing to a destination public IP. But how, this gets into routers and their job..  Routing is an important concept in networking, in that they have the capabilities to router across network segments. It's why you need one for Internet. Routers have routing tables that they can get manually, be you entering routing path (source, destination, default gateway format), or dynamically by using protocols that are programmed to discover routes via algorithms.  Without a router knowing a path beyond itself, it cannot route to it, so this factors into how packets are sent. Most public usage on the Internet will never have issues with reaching its host because once it leaves your house router, the rest of the router linkage to your destination will have routing tables.  I won't even get started about subnetting, but know it's an amazing concept to preserve the finite amount of IPv4 addresses there are. Look it up.  I'm on mobile and have the get going, but I think just trying to learn networking and watching some video explanations you will grasp the concept.  Also you can set up VMs or use network building apps like Cisco's free PacketTracer, you will learn a lot about networking and the heart of hacking or data distribution almost always will involve it."

HowToHack,3d2zqi,hellor00t,2,Mon Jul 13 11:45:24 2015 UTC,"Sure thing. I'll update the blog post later, but I'll answer your question here as well.  As far as my background, I have completed about 75% of an undergraduate degree in computer science. In addition, I've played in various CTF tournaments (I usually play by myself though). Most of my practical security knowledge comes from self learning outside of the classroom. But my college courses really taught me to be an awesome programmer. Before the course, I was already familiar with concepts like SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflows, and could exploit simple examples. So I had a decent amount of knowledge beforehand, but I was definitely still a rookie.  When it comes to the amount of exploit writing/altering... that's tough to answer. Most of the time during the labs you don't need to write an exploit from scratch. Either there's already a Metasploit module, or a proof of concept that only needs a few tweaks. And they really were only tweaks, like changing the number of a port, or an ip address, or swapping out shell code. There were a couple times where I would need to alter C code to make system calls, but even that wasn't too intensive.  I used a slew of languages during the course though. It's definitely more important to understand programming concepts than just specific language syntax. Most of the languages I worked with were just scripting languages. And then on top of that there was a little bit of Java and C. Here's a quick list off the top of my head:   C Java PHP Python Ruby ColdFusion JavaScript Perl   You don't necessarily need to be proficient in any particular language, but you need to have a solid understanding of programming concepts. This was easy for me since I have formal training in programming. I already knew C, Java, Python, PHP, and JavaScript decently well. So I would just use a reference while working with the other languages I came across.  Researching and learning on your own is a huge part of this course, so if you are lacking in an area, you'd better have great Google Fu. Going in, I knew the least about Windows internals and how things like domain controllers work. So I definitely had to do a lot of additional research on that stuff.   Anyway, thanks for your feedback. I really appreciate it. Let me know if there's anything I need to clarify, or if you have any other questions."

HowToHack,3d2zqi,seducer4real,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:01:52 2015 UTC,Do you feel that the experience you had in programming prior to taking the course helped you immensely or was it just a bonus?
HowToHack,3d2zqi,hellor00t,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:31:38 2015 UTC,It definitely helped. It's a lot easier to focus on learning one thing at a time than two.
HowToHack,3d2zqi,seducer4real,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:34:59 2015 UTC,"They say on their website you need to understand the TCP/IP suite and experience in Perl/Python would be good. I'd say you should learn how to use the terminal before hand and just how to get your way around Kali Linux. You dont want to spend the first month struggling on navigating directories. Im hoping to take the course soon, right now Im preparing as much as I can."
HowToHack,3d2zqi,VodkaHaze,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:18:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's something I probably should have mentioned in my response to his question. Being comfortable in a terminal and Linux environment (not necessarily Kali) is an absolute must. Before the course, I've run mostly Ubuntu and switched to Arch about a month before I restarted the course.  Knowing the TCP/IP suite is definitely good, but I think it's simple enough that you kind of absorb that as you learn other things in the course. And in response to Perl/Python, you will definitely work with both in the course, but understanding of any scripting language makes it much easier to start working with others."

Connecting to the router via WPS won't give you the password for the router.  Although once you've connected to it, your computer will automatically connect again when or if you come back into range of the connection after leaving it.

Follow any number of tutorials on the web for the aircrack suite/Kali.  Don't start with WPA/WPA2 cracking, though.

Change the router you're hacking to WPS and hack it.  The quick results will get you motivated.  Then, move onto cracking WPA/WPA2.  Make your password easy so it can be found in a dictionary attack.  You'll have to download a dictionary file.  When you're using a dictionary attack, you're not actually cracking the password.  You're trying different combinations of passwords until one works.  Trying all these passwords is automatic.  It can take DAYS to get through a dictionary file; that's why you make your own password easy.  I want you to have quick results for motivation.

Look them up individually to see which ones/methods interest you.  You could also just look up Kali Linux tutorials on the internet.  They are abundant.  Don't start with programming; you need quick results (for yourself, mentally).  Programming is great, and I'm a programmer, but you just don't need to start with that.  Also, I've seen this percentage multitudes of times as well as heard  it at a network security convention/hacking convention: 85% of hacks are done through social engineering.  Kali Linux is a great collection of individual tools.  It's not an end-all.  It will certainly get you started, however.  I can't ""mentor"" you; I lack the time.  Find tutorials on Kali Linux and go from there.    Also, unless you have a spare laptop around, there is nothing wrong with installing Kali Linux in a virtual machine.  You must know, however, that a virtual machine will treat EVEN a wireless adapter in a laptop as a wired connection.  It's the nature of a virtual machine.  If you run Kali Linux in a VM, you will need an external USB adapter.  I have this one: Alfa AWUSO36NHA.  The Alfa's dominate in pen-testing.  Also, with an external wireless, you can just hack wireless from your desktop.  NOW, that will let you dip your feet into wireless hacking.  There's a lot you can do with wired, as well!  Then there's a tool in Kali that will let you download a website (i.e. the first several pages of Facebook).  If you have those, you can redirect people to YOUR fake ""Facebook"" login page, they enter their username and credentials, and you have them!  You could tell them they entered it incorrectly, then send them to the REAL Facebook or you could simply pass the credentials they entered yourself.  Hope the above helps!  VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!! - You will get a lot of responses to your inquiry with people tossing around terms designed to scare you off, make themselves look good (when many of them don't know a damn thing beyond seeing the words on the internet).  Don't be scared off if anyone does that; they're immature and trying to raise their own self esteem.  That's directed at noone, btw, but I see it in here all the time.  Help the guy dip his toes in the water, damnit!    p.s. A new version of Kali Linux comes out in August, but go ahead and start now.  What I said above is generic; Kali Linux just packages all these great tools that you'd otherwise know nothing about.  Don't be scared of Linux, either.  Just find a tutorial and follow it!"

I learn exceptionally quickly and am an excellent problem solver. I'm extremely motivated as well.   All this doesn't matter however to my few initial failed attempts to start learning how to program. The pay off just isn't quick enough and often you either don't know what you're doing our you're doing something so mundane that you don't care about it.   My current experience with programming is that I can logically program python in a few ways. I can make my little Arduino do simple task and operate small systems and logic for myself (luckily I also know basics of electronics). I do a little with jdk for android.  I must say, the most fun and satisfying experience I've yet had with computers was hacking my wifi with aircrack suite after he set a password I didn't know at my request, and then monitoring his traffic and telling him everything he was doing. It was hilarious, fun, and my roommate received an added level of intimidation from myself.   I also learned an incredible amount from the tutorials and actually doing it. All I had to do was buy a $30 wireless adapter and watch the tutorials. It was incredibly easy but fascinating, enjoyable, and satisfying."

I just checked it again and it seems nowadays it doesn't need to download the whole image, and it works pretty well. If you want to know exactly how it works check out the full source code."
HowToHack,3clbk5,PTheboss,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:44:12 2015 UTC,"what? If you're saying what I think you're saying... no, buddy.       Yes, it worked like the tens of other apps that run android on linux, just like this, these 3 apps mentioned here and there are at least a dozen more. I have no idea what you think I was saying, but I sure as hell know what I'm saying, and that it's correct.   Unless you've got an external (i.e. USB via OTG) wireless adapter... nope. 99.9% of the network adapters (radios) on phones don't support any kind of promiscuity.       I think you have no idea how arp spoofing works, or what promiscuous mode does. Let me explain: if promiscuous mode is not enabled, then the NIC drops all the traffic that is not intended for it, in other words, if the frame has a different MAC address, then it will not be received. However when promiscuous mode is enabled, then all incoming traffic, regardless of the MAC address, will get passed to the device for processing (copying all other traffic, not intercepting).    ARP spoofing works so that the attacking device tells the router that send all the traffic that is supposed to go to the victims IP, to the attacking devices MAC address, and not the victims MAC address. See here, promiscuous mode isn't needed when ARP spoofing is used, because the frames will have the attacking devices MAC address on them, so there is no need to see all the traffic. Then after the attacking device is done with modifying or saving the frames or whatever, it passes them to the victims device. Hope you learned something :P"
HowToHack,3clbk5,PTheboss,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:54:41 2015 UTC,"It makes use of something called gratuitous ARP.  Usually a device needs to send out an ARP request asking the whole network what the MAC address of the gateway is, the gateway would reply.  This essentially sends out a packet telling the target ""Hey, I'm your default gateway and my MAC address is <insert MAC of android phone>, send all your frames to me.""  The phone does the same thing to the router saying ""Hey I'm the <victim>, send the frames to me"".  The phone then passes the frames onto the proper destinations after modifying them in silly ways.    Yes you can recreate similar functionality to the man in the middle attack using arpspoof, but as far as transforming the packets, that's something that will take some creativity.  I would certainly invite you to learn some of the fundamentals of networking.  Browsing this subreddit for the first time it seems to be full of people who don't really understand what they're actually doing and just asking what to type in a terminal."

Those type of exploits would not be needed by those that took advantage of your parents' naivete.

When your parents cooperated, they opened themselves up any 12-year-old that can download TeamViewer.  You don't need a special RAT.  *** I don't think you have anything to learn from the computer and you should wipe it.  Barring wiping it, don't connect it to your home network (or any other network for that matter).  Also, don't try to use it for anything useful, productive or financial until you wipe it (beyond your curious poking around).  Before doing such a thing, however, clone the drive.  Skip the imaging; it's file-based and useless against many things that try to hide.  You can't even use an imaged computer in court.  It needs to be cloned; a sector-by-sector copy including all that useless, empty space (which may not actually be empty).  There IS a difference and the technologies are different.  It is possible to write things outside the ""writeable"" area of the drive.  Additionally, if it's an SSD, SSD's are understated in their actual storage capabilities.  There is storage in SSDs that the average user could not possibly use.  It's utilized invisibly in the background.  P.S. I mean no offense to those that mentioned imaging.  Many people use the terms ""imaging"" and ""cloning"" interchangeably.  They are absolutely NOT the same thing, however, and the terms are NOT interchangeable.  TL;DR: The only thing I can say in a TL;DR is: #1) Clone, don't image; #2) I believe OP would bite off more than he could chew or learn about IF there was some kind of ""advanced"" malware; #3) OP has presented no reason to think there was some kind of ""advanced"" RAT, malware or anything on this laptop.

I don't disagree with your conclusion and perhaps I inferred my intentions differently than I had hoped, my reverse engineering in this situation would be no more than reverse engineering of their methodology and basics about their software like what port they chose and possibly which IP was used, I've no delusions about being able to decompile it, 6-7 years time maybe, but, lol not now.   I asked my parents specifically if the mouse had been moving and things typed on the screen, the answer to both was yes, and also that they left the computer alone with 'them' on it doing 'things' - hence my conclusion that they installed some sort of software. No Av warning popped up making me believe the file was masked, I simply wanted to see what type of file it was hidden in, or where it was located and my intrigue would have been satiated.  Perhaps in the excitement I was a bit optimistic, my parents could be wrong and if what they stated was just misinformation/misunderstood on their side, it's not impossible, the whole 'we're on your computer' could have been social engineering also, infact, I'm almost certain it was this now.  You highlight one point I definitely wanted to make clear I understood, any 12yr old with a trojan can install something on your computer, the weakest part of a computer system is between the chair and the keyboard. It's far easier to be malicious than it should be and people like my parents are to blame. Oh it felt good to have the shoe on the other foot in this situation, my folks are pretty decent and I haven't had many opportunities for childhood retribution hehe.  The laptop will not be on any network for certain until its cleaned, and after Torvauns suggestion of looking at the router logs and sifting through all the superfluous yet interesting data, all sites visited that day are legit. I'm inclined to believe, enforced by what people have written - the laptop is clean. Ill check emails and other things tomorrow for suspicious things, but a fresh install will get me a free laptop it seems! I'm also assuming the 0-day market is much like the black market, when a gun costs $50k you don't have to worry about the small time crooks getting their hands on it. If the dark web is anything to go by, and I'm a little apprehensive towards it, 0-days can go for big bucks!  I'm fairly certain I've seen what you mentioned about the 'hidden' partition in SSD's in an informative def-con con presentation on YouTube or possibly an APT report. It's similar to BadUSB no? I'm guilty completely of using cloning/imaging interchangeably, I jumped to the conclusion that Torvaun meant DD. I was bamboozled a tad as i started to lean towards a thought perhaps DD was creating an ISO file I didn't know about? Thanks to curiosity spurring me on... I learnt it can do that, how useful! So, I may not have had the tinkering I had hoped for, but I've learnt plenty and am thrilled at the responses I have received."
HowToHack,3cbc48,kschmidt62226,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, a 0-day exploit would be expensive because, with it, you could target anyone utilizing the system the exploit is designed to, well, EXPLOIT! :)  You also probably realize this, but a fresh install will NOT give you a clean laptop.  Wiping the drive, THEN re-installing is what you need to do.  Again, I'm sure you realize this, but to alleviate your concerns, wipe the drive first.  I also wanted to mention that I never said SSDs have a hidden partition.  I said they're capacity is purposely understated.  It's not a hidden partition that I referred to; it's simply extra space that's utilized for two purposes:  1) SSDs will randomly utilize all the available free space on a drive.  This reduces the writes on any given cell.  If you're constantly writing to the same cell because you keep modifying one little cell of a spreadsheet, that cell will die out very quickly.  By spreading out the writes to all the cells;  2) When a cell totally dies out, the ""maximum capacity"" (that you can use) of an SSD remains the same.  One more thing: An SSD is not an SSD is not an SSD.  SSDs used in my company don't run faster than a HDD.  They are made for durability and the ability to be moved around and bumped with damaging the spinning platter.  The SSDs I have in my gaming rig -which I also use for a lot of virtualization when I'm testing things- would run circles around anything in my workplace.  Do research; don't buy something because it's on sale WITHOUT doing your research.  IOPS (Input/Output operations) are still a big factor for me when determining how much to spend or recommend for myself or others.  Also, just in case SOMEONE out there doesn't know this, don't ever frickin' defrag an SSD.  If you feel the need to defrag an SSD, give your entire computer to a needy student and move to one of those countries, taking a job calling people dumber than you so you can scam them for money! :)   (that last part is NOT directed at OP or anyone else).    p.s. Don't bother with that multiple-pass, ""security wipe"" crap on your laptop.  Format the drive.  Those multiple-pass wipes that corporations and other high-security places utilize are remnants of drives no longer in use.  Just like taxes, it's hard to get rid of rules and regulations once they're in place.    p.p.s. to OP, referring to a comment in your original post: Anyone looking at MY posting history will never accuse me of constantly posing ""one-liners"".  ""I've starting talking, and I can't shut up!""  :D"
HowToHack,3cbc48,kschmidt62226,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:23:07 2015 UTC,"You just keep on giving don't you! Thanks for the clarification. I've stayed away from SSDd's for the time being mainly due to cost per Gb but the trade off has become more palatable of late. Once my A+ is done, ill be back into research mode to build my own gaming rig. SSD's are chapter 6 in my study guide and I'm only up to chapter 3 CPU's.  As for the laptop, I undertook one last cursory sweep for downloads this morning, found nowt, so it's being formatted as we speak, then I'm going to partition it into my first dual boot laptop.  I have been having mixed views on the whole shredding drive/Dban thing, the arguments for and against are both pretty loud. I sided with shredding due to caution from a lack of complete understanding, but I always felt once data is overwritten its gone, if recovering data was so easy people wouldn't lose so many word documents at work and corrupted files would be easily recoverable (that is a gross over generalisation I know). Thanks again, I feel a renewed vigour to go to back to studying!"
HowToHack,3cbc48,Torvaun,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:51:54 2015 UTC,"LOL!  Of course I keep giving!  Plenty of people work in IT and related fields; people with the passion you've exhibited are a joy to talk to!  :)  I'll keep this response shorter for you.  :)  Shredding a drive is only necessary if you leave stuff on it you feel is important.  Take it to a metal shop and have them punch a couple of holes in it.  One thing you really have to understand, however, is that there is no one RIGHT answer!  It is VERY commonly said that security is give and take; convenience vs necessity.  The military may need to shred drives; there probably not anything on your parent's hard-drive that anybody would bother to try to recover after one format.  SSDs are a whole different story on deleting, formatting and recovering data.  Remember those extra cells I talked about?  Remember how I said stuff gets moved around in the background?  Since the SSD firmware wants to limit the writes to cells as much as possible, deleting a file on a SSD or formatting it is not the same as doing the same on an HDD.  Also, people lose word documents, etc., at work as you said.  Those same people generally don't have the knowledge to recover it, even it's it could be an easy recovery.  It's not WORTH it to those people to call -or potentially have a departmental charge from the IT department- to recover a file, no matter how easy the task.  So they just suffer.  That doesn't mean that someone like me -and eventually you- couldn't sit down and bring it back in 5 minutes.  I know I said I'd be short, but let me close with one more thing please!  There's a story..........  A computer tech (or engineer or whatever) had a service call.  The tech observed the situation, worked for about 5 minutes and was finished.  A week later, the company the tech was sent to received his bill for $500.  The manager was OUTRAGED and called the tech's company.  The tech's company responded by sending a new bill that said this:   Pressing some keys - $5.00 5 minutes labor - $5.00   * KNOWING WHICH KEYS TO PRESS - $490  Don't EVER forget that knowledge is power (and money).  You already know a lot more than the average person, Skinny_Cynic.  Don't compare yourself and your skills to others in here.  Also, in IT, don't ever stop learning!  I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOO sorry that I seem apparently incapable of writing a short post or response when it comes to technology.  p.s. If you'd like me to stop responding or simply ask questions, then just say so or ask your questions and I'll be brief.  Have a great day!  EDIT: Sorry about the formatting; I didn't have time to fix it."
HowToHack,3cbc48,AOLdialup,3,Tue Jul 7 12:02:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I understand the jackass comment, i should perhaps add to the story that disposable income is not a problem for my parents. A new laptop was purchased the same day and the hacked given to me under the condition I set up the new one for them :) The suggestion of router logs is great, I hadn't considered those logs and was focusing too much on the laptop. Given the abrupt nature of the routers disconnect, unless deletion was occurring right at the moment of dc, I think i may just have another path to play around and explore!"
HowToHack,3cbc48,nimbusfool,3,Mon Jul 6 17:21:39 2015 UTC,Fair enough.  You should still image the drive so you can screw around with it all you like and be able to get back to now.  Like having multiple saves in case one gets corrupted.

Some phrases that have been drilled into me -  RTFM and BACKUPS BACKUPS BACKUPS  :) I have a large stack of external drives solely for backups.

HowToHack,3cbc48,babypowder617,5,Mon Jul 6 19:32:08 2015 UTC,"Hi there, excellent first post!  This may surprise you, but from the detail you provided, I'm actually not convinced the computer has any malware on it! Most of these types of phising calls are coordinated by individuals or groups which specialize (and actually, that is a generous word in most cases) in social engineering, and are often not technologically proficient.  If I spent the time to develop or purchased a RAT, I likely have a much better distribution plan in place than cold-calling my intended victim, unless that intended victim is a whale in a spear phishing campaign or something. It's much easier to spam links to a drive by kit than to physically pick up the phone and massage your victim into downloading malware.  Also, it's obvious these people were after bank account information, so had it been provided, I don't see much reason to believe they would have wanted persistent access to the computer; as they already had the payoff.  So my suggestion, as a first step, is to see if they downloaded any of the various free remote desktop software installers (Team Viewer, Ammyy, Show my PC, Logmein, etc.) If you find one of these installers, it's safe to say that the computer was not compromised by this attack. If you don't find one, then continue your forensic investigation."

It sounds like you don't know much about ""hacking"", so I would just get a computer that's good for college. Anything you buy will probably be more than adequate for learning about computer security.  Your college probably has a recommendation list for incoming students.

Most people won't run into issues with RAM/CPU unless they're trying to do CPU password cracking (don't bother), or trying to run several VMs at once (requires plenty of RAM). You can make anything into a passable hacking computer. Personally, I like my MacBook Pro, but Apple devices certainly aren't for everyone. It's largely up to personal preference, and compatibility with what you need to do. If you want to run Linux full time, make sure there's good Linux driver support for your device. Otherwise, you can run Kali as a VM when you need it, which is what many people do."

Sure you can also do this with ollydbg. Or you could use a disassembler and modify the binary itself. Or you use cheatengine. Or you can use DLL Injection.  DLL Injection is just a nice technique to modify or get access to another process. The cool thing about DLL injections is, that i's pretty easy to get executable code inside another process that it runs there. And this can help us in multiple places:   malware can copy itself into other processes with DLL injection to hide from the taskmanager. malware can copy itself into important processes such as the browser or email client, to steal or modify content Game Bots inject themselves into the game to control it.

Unfortunately, the game will often have protection against memory editors and memory debuggers.   To bypass this security, you can try just deleting the anti-hacking software, but the game (especially popular games) will most likely have systems in place to detect this. Another thing you could do is, find where the anti-hacking stuff starts up and does its magic anti-hack detection, and prevent it from doing so by either misdirecting it or stopping certain modules without triggering the game's checks.   I remember reading about a HackShield bypass that would disable only some parts of it, preventing it from functioning normally but yet without telling the game ""Hey, I'm not working properly!"". This essentially would open a hole for you to run your stuff and get all the information you want.  Again, this is just my, perhaps completely wrong, understanding of this.

But, now that you know python, you can write your own little scripts and stuff, to do h4x with. For instance, there's probably a way to spider an entire website in python. You can use that to look for interesting directories, then afterwards take each url and append file.txt (not really ""file.txt"" though, use your imagination here), to look for specific files.  Probably my favourite python thingo is scapy. It's a packet making thingo, written in python. There's some quite cool things you can do with it, for instance writing your own custom scanning tools (SYN scans, ARP scans, ping scans) and (my personal favourite) sending stupid malformed packets, in the hopes that it kills a router or something. However, if you don't know anything about networking and packets and stuff, it's like looking at assembly. And maybe it's not a good program to start with.  I built a small password cracker in python once, for a Uni assignment. It was slow as shit, took 10 minutes to crack something that took hashcat 2 seconds, haha.

If I'm understanding you correctly, you want to look at the requests and responses, rather than the raw packets. A tool like Burp is designed for exactly this scenario.  Burp's intercepting proxy features will allow you to view responses even if they are using SSL, because you can proxy all traffic through Burp, and Burp handles the SSL negotiation between you and the computer. I believe Fiddler can do something similar, although I'm not entirely sure about that."

The pattern is defined by the next set of characters: ""%"" means a number, and ""@"" means a lower case alpha character.

HowToHack,3bj80t,kizzzzurt,5,Mon Jun 29 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"The term ""deep web"" just refers to the collection of websites that are not indexed by standard search engines."
HowToHack,3bj80t,soloplate,-2,Mon Jun 29 21:52:17 2015 UTC,"Right, I know the definition of sites on the 'deep web'. The sites are now indexed by definition in this article here, which is likely indexed via Google and other standard search engines, so by proxy, these really aren't deep web sites anymore, no?"
HowToHack,3bj80t,kizzzzurt,3,Mon Jun 29 21:56:18 2015 UTC,"It seems like you forgot to post your article.  No, they're still not indexed.

If they were indexed, I would be able to type in the name or address of any site from this list and find their content via Google.  Even though technically Google may ""know"" they exist via this list, it still has no idea what they contain. That's the difference here."
HowToHack,3bj80t,soloplate,-2,Mon Jun 29 22:00:14 2015 UTC,"The article is the one that we are commenting on..?  I said 'by proxy', I did not say that the sites are now magically there and searchable because this article was posted. Never said that."
HowToHack,3bj80t,kizzzzurt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:02:41 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I didn't realize you were talking about the same article. But I think you're still a bit confused on the concept of search indexing. Things can't be indexed 'by proxy'. They're either indexed via normal search engines, or not.   Google can crawl through sites and visit links, but it still can't go visit the onion links because it works on a different protocol.

HowToHack,3bm1sy,ChaosInvulged,7,Tue Jun 30 08:53:30 2015 UTC,"I'll give you an actual answer since half the comments are snarky.  You aren't finding people to teach you things because to really understand how to hack something, you have to kind of find the information on your own and put pieces of the puzzle together for yourself. That's how you make the necessary mental connections to understand how everything works behind the scenes and how to think dynamically in the field instead of just reproducing mindless step-by-step tutorials.  With this in mind, take things in little chunks and strive to learn everything about computers, networks, software, hardware, etc. Once you have a good fundamental background, let your curiosity and particular interests guide your learning.   To understand how to perform attacks, you must first be able to understand the underlying technology being exploited. For example, if you wanted to learn how to perform an SQL injection, not only should you first learn the SQL language, but also databases, sometimes supplemental web languages (PHP, JavaScript), and why some websites are vulnerable while others aren't.  So as a starting point, take the area of computers you know the least about and try to learn everything about it. If that happens to be networks, learn everything about how the internet works, how packets are routed, how routers work, how DNS works, etc. Try to become better well-rounded. When you feel generally well-rounded in your knowledge, start moving to specifics like different vulnerabilities and exploits. When you get to that point, you will likely have an easier time finding what you want to know, as there are a lot of resources available. A really good example of a resource for learning web application hacking is The Web Application Hacker's Handbook. Also, using Linux is a must and a good distro to use is Kali Linux.  TL;DR Complete your background knowledge of computers, networks, software, and hardware before just jumping into hacking. Let your curiosity guide you. Always strive to learn more. Use online resources and resources like the link provided. Use Kali Linux when you're ready to try things for yourself.  Also, if at any point you get stuck or would just like someone to discuss security with, feel free to PM me."

HowToHack,3ber19,TheHellShadow,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:36:16 2015 UTC,"You are mistaken.  If you do that, all you would accomplish would be to mess up the local cache of the website that's currently on your local machine. Other users wouldn't be affected at all, and the server wouldn't be affected at all. It would be the same thing as downloading a PDF of an instruction manual, printing it out, and scribbling on it with a black marker. The only person you'd be hacking would be yourself.  But, let's say that you do make your own little SWF file that gets injected into the official website as your computer downloads and renders it. What would you do with it? The SWF doesn't have some sort of magic special access to the server, it does nothing you couldn't already be doing with your machine already, because as the old saying goes, ""The client cannot be trusted"".  If the server is so foolish as to trust the SWF's data upload without validation, then an SWF isn't necessary to mess them up, you could just write five lines of JavaScript make your faux data upload to the trusting server, no recompilation of SWF necessary."
HowToHack,3ber19,Drakim,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:22:37 2015 UTC,"See, this gives me hope. I don't see how it can be validated further? The data being sent is literally the integer representation of an image based on its index value"
HowToHack,3ber19,Drakim,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:37:14 2015 UTC,"But then what do you need to a recompiled SWF for? Just figure out how this data is being sent to the server (POST request maybe?) and use your favorite scripting language to send that POST request.  All the SWF file provides is a sort of limited graphical interface to these preprogrammed requests. Why do you need to ""hack"" the graphical interface?  I'm guessing that what you really want is just some program to sniff out the HTTP request header as the SWF file sends it, and then duplicate it and make your own custom request.  If the programmmer had any sort of sense though he'd put in validation checks on the server side, limiting the options that the server will accept to those already listed inside the SWF and nothing else."
HowToHack,3ber19,Drakim,1 point,Tue Jul 7 09:07:04 2015 UTC,"It's a website based upon chance, the random selection is in the SWF, the outcome is the parsed out of the SWF by a function in the HTML container.

HowToHack,3ber19,Drakim,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:02:29 2015 UTC,"Easiest way, just navigate to the page, bring up your browser's javascript console, and invoke that JavaScript function in the HTML page manually, with your own bogus random value.  Harder way, use an extension like firefox's Live HTTP Headers to figure out how the http request is sent to the server (how it's structured) and write your own script that mimics this request for you. That way you won't even need the orginal webpage."

You can host your own vulnerable websites while you learn so you're know you'll have exploits to discover and you're not at risk of getting in trouble messing with someone else's server. There are a ton of write-ups online (shameless plug of my own blog) for you to follow along with. Just pick a point to start and go nuts!"

HowToHack,3b95xa,solreaper,0,Sat Jun 27 09:22:57 2015 UTC,HTML is 100% must have. Codecademy would probably be ok. I highly recommend JavaScript as almost every website uses it.

HowToHack,3b5xka,Fhy40,4,Fri Jun 26 06:05:48 2015 UTC,"You'll need a public IP.  Either create in incoming NAT rule and point the callback to that public socket or set up a VPS and run msfconsole from there.  You could also try a bind tcp instead of reverse, which would open a port on target that you connect to.  Thats usually not my preferred method though."
HowToHack,3b5xka,artagel,3,Fri Jun 26 06:47:16 2015 UTC,"Very simple, if you are on your home network:  Step 1. Go into your router and forward the port you are grabbing the reverse shell from to your computers MAC address.  Step 2. In your reverse shell sent to the victim, put your public IP address. (www.ipchicken.com or curl icanhazip.com)  Step 3. In your metasploit options, set your listening port to the one you specified to be forwarded. Set your listening address to 0.0.0.0 this will accept any connections coming to the machine on that port  Step 4. Exploit and grab your meterpreter shell  Step 5. Go to jail if you don't have permission to do this."

HowToHack,3b5xka,Maleus21,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:46:17 2015 UTC,You could always get a cheap (if there is one) mobile hotspot and create your lab with that as the outside connection. Then you can test your network as if you're truly outside of it by pointing at your dynamic public ip for your home network.

Hacking is more about exploring and figuring things out, and less about passing tests. Try purchasing a raspberry pi on amazon and try some projects. A quick google search will reveal tons of easy ones. Maybe set up a piratebox, or a web server or maybe an automatic wifi hacker.

HowToHack,3b2fhg,jray80066,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:31:53 2015 UTC,"So penetration testing is kind of tough because even within pentest teams there are specialists. Its not like you go conduct a pentest and its just you going to town. You're with a team and that may consist of a networking guy, a programmer, a linux guy. Its kind of a toss up.  If you want to learn web application security I recommend you learn Javascript, mySQL, PHP, etc. Nikto, Firebug and BurpSuite are some tools you may want to look into for web applications.  Hacking Art of Exploitation is centered around C and is for programming exploits. I would skip it for now.   As far as for your course line up goes... meh? If those are going to keep you motivated keep up with it, but those certs are kind of crap. You would be much better off installing Linux and just using it. Practice building or mimicing tools in python and of course visiting this subreddit."
HowToHack,3b3adc,jayjay097531,3,Thu Jun 25 16:51:34 2015 UTC,"There is a lot more to this than just a port and an ip address.  Your NIC MAC address is your computer's network identity.  The IP is just where it resides on the network.    So before jumping into learning IP addresses or the different classes, I would get familiar with ports and protocols.  As for the beast that is IPV6 addressing, get a good grip on IPV4 first, it's much easier to grasp as a beginner.    Each application or service has a different port and thats how they transfer data back and forth.  Have a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers  And to understand how these packets get from one computer to another read up on the OSI or TCP model to see the flow of these packets."

HowToHack,3b3adc,hellor00t,3,Thu Jun 25 17:24:43 2015 UTC,"You can't just send random packets to people who don't request them. Ports are not holes that are ""open"" all the time. Think of them more of doors. Some of them require you to knock before they let you in, others require a key, some require a key and a password. Some have a guard.  ""Brute Force Threads"" doesn't really happen that way. You can't just force your way in.   I would second that you should learn the OSI model first and foremost. Then research TCP and UDP communication. That will answer a majority of your questions right off the bat.  In short it will take you through how a packet goes across Layer 1 (Physical Cables) and traverses through a network until it hits Layer 7 (Application)."
HowToHack,3b3adc,n00py,3,Fri Jun 26 01:35:36 2015 UTC,"Not trying to be mean, but your understanding seems way off. I'd recommended learning about the OSI model, and other core networking concepts. Network+ study material would be an excellent place to start learning."
HowToHack,3b3adc,n3sutran,2,Fri Jun 26 01:27:29 2015 UTC,"Well first of all TCP is a protocol that's used on the transport later and IP on the network layer. So in order to completely understand how all of the transferring works, you might want to check out the different layers first.  Second of all, 80 os the default port for http, while there are other ports (90/91..) who could be used to lower server stress and 443 for https."
