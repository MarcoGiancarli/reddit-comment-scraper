Here is a really detailed explanation in english.   Basically, soft ground is waxy substance that is used to transfer texture onto a plate. So I put the lace material onto the plate when I ran in through the press. When you put the plate into the acid bath, it etches the texture into it.   You can use plant leaves and and feathers and other things too, but I used lace because it reminded me of the floral patterns on some mattresses- where chinches live!"

The bits of chatter don't detract from it for me, but if you want to avoid those in the future on small prints you can do the final run by rubbing a spoon on the back of the paper instead of putting the print through a press. Personally I like seeing chatter in the right places, because it makes it obvious that a print is a relief process, but to each their own.  Great job!"

printmaking,3df4un,the_pressman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:31:21 2015 UTC,"Looks like too much pressure IMHO. My shop does lots of jobs on coasters and that cracking of the material is the sign of bad stock, too much pressure, or both. Most people new to letterpress love a deep impression to show that the work they bought or made is used with traditional machinery but I think you want too far on this one. Also, the half tone would probably be slightly easier to read if less pressure is used. Great idea though. And that red is really playful, which goes great with the content of the ""quote""."

You typically want to print at at least 300 dpi, so you would get about 3""x3"" out of that image. As you print it larger, the worse it will look.  It is generally frowned upon to steal an artists work and print it yourself.

As far as application goes I used the tip of a pencil to apply the screen filler with as much detail as I could stand to do.

printmaking,3c9fnk,katherinemiller45,5,Mon Jul 6 03:15:14 2015 UTC,"You want to make sure you're not trying to carve too deep. It doesn't take too deep of a cut to get the marks you're after. Get a piece of scrap and experiment with depth and tools and then print it up real fast. I was surprised with how little I could take away to get a nice clear image when I started. If it's not printing clean you can always go back and clear some more out. I also recommend using a bench hook to hold your linoleum in place while you are carving if you are not already. You should never have your body in a position to get cut when your tool slips, the tools are very sharp and can easily puncture your arm or do equally nasty things."
printmaking,3c9fnk,thurpleton,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:05:48 2015 UTC,"More often than not this is it, all you have to do is break the surface plane.  A lot of people end up gouging out a ton of material, which is okay, but unnecessary."
printmaking,3c9fnk,doublen00b,5,Sat Jul 11 16:50:46 2015 UTC,"Regular, gray lino is easier to carve when it is warmed up first. I'll set it in sunlight for awhile or maybe on top of a warm oven (not the stove though). How much pressure you are using makes a difference too. If it is breaking off in chunks, you may be using too much pressure. You don't need to carve very deep, so start gently and get the hang of using the tool before you really start scooping out large areas. Once you get used to it, you'll get better at gauging how much pressure to use. Also, PLEASE keep your free hand behind your cutting hand. Get a bench block to help steady your carving material so you aren't putting your hand in front of your carving tool and gouging yourself. Its one of those injuries we've all gotten and could have been avoided easily. Good luck!"

printmaking,3c9fnk,Buhbuhbuhbuh,2,Mon Jul 6 05:38:42 2015 UTC,"You mean gouging tools right? You are supposed to push firmly, but carefully. Put some non-slip grip material under your block so it won't slide as much."
printmaking,3c9fnk,5everandalways,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:01:36 2015 UTC,"I'm basically just restating what the other users have said, but I guess repeating it can't hurt.  Of all things, the pink rubber should definitely be carving, with dull tools it would just crumble and you wouldn't get clean lines, but it should still carve super easily, with barely any pressure.  It seems stupid, but definitely make sure you're carving with the sharpened end.  Others have recommended a bench hook, which could definitely help. I highly suggest one for newbies. The bench hook will stop you from getting cut (unless you're VERY clumsy like I am) because then you place the block flat against the back (it's like a shelf on the table) and then you put pressure into the block, while having your free hand behind the tool, maybe holding the side of the block that isn't against the bench hook.  Always carve away from you. Always always.  The tools might need sharpening- I have a couple Speedball brand multi-tip lino tool sets, I won't use other brands of that variety, and I do sharpen them even when I'm using stuff like easy-cut...less pressure = fewer screwups like carving out half of your block....  Are there burrs or nicks on your tools? If you (carefully) look at them closely are there little bumps or chunks missing from the sharpened edge? Then they most likely need to be sharpened. Or replaced. I've (unfortunately) seen new tools arrive dull and/or with burrs on them from being poorly sharpened initially.  It seems counter-intuitive, but applying too much pressure can affect your carving as well.   Other than that...if you post pictures of the state of your tools/what's happening to your blocks, I'm not sure anyone can give you feedback past what's already been shared.  I'm trying to remember troubleshooting from when I was in school (since my BFA is in Printmaking) and honestly...there really isn't anything beyond what people mentioned here. Best of luck!"

printmaking,3b96je,ItsAnArt,2,Sat Jun 27 03:20:56 2015 UTC,"Do you intend for these to be worn as clothing, or framed? How do you see these pieces functioning?   That is one of the interesting aspects of this project. Because of the deliberate manipulation of an existing product into something quite opposite of its original intent, I am treating it differently than other shirt designs and think it can work as a piece.   But I also like the look as a wearable shirt, and made an edition of roughly 25 with that in mind. For example, I'm absolutely wearing this on the 4th of July! That said, as far as printing on a shirt goes, this was way more complicated than any other design I've done and presents real limitations in the quantity that can be done. Something about the commercial dye or 80/20 polyester/cotton blend made it very hard to fade these. Just putting bleach on them did nothing, which is pretty wild. A student of mine gave me the solution I couldn't find anywhere else - they had to be boiled in bleach - and a rolling boil, specifically. My gas bill is going to be 3 time higher or something!"

It's fascinating to hear that sublimation printed ink is so durable. I always imagined that the process would produce an easily-deteriorated image.   Anyway, I like the intent behind this project. The intersection of fine art and commercial printmaking is an interesting place with many opportunities to be had."

Written at a time when Adolf Hitler was already Chancellor of Germany, it was produced, Benjamin wrote, in the effort to describe a theory of art that would be ""useful for the formulation of revolutionary demands in the politics of art."" He argued that, in the absence of any traditional, ritualistic value, art in the age of mechanical reproduction would inherently be based on the practice of politics.

Rodin, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Albrect Durer, Dali, Picasso. They all used printmaking as vehicle for their concepts at some point. General art theory can be applied to the printmaking aesthetics, but as u/empireoflight pointed out printmaking does one thing the other types of art can't (make reproductions). The theory of the multiple was used by Andy Warhol to desensitize his viewers into thinking a car crash was beautiful or to increase the notion of celebrity as a commodity. Hope this helps get the juices flowing to just research some artists and see how they viewed the importance of printmaking in art."

printmaking,3b7020,Troglobitten,3,Sat Jun 27 14:10:29 2015 UTC,"Just my 2 cents, but to me printmaking is just printmaking. I just recently found my love for it, as I have been put off by anything art related for years after art college had forced me to explore my reasoning in my work.  There seems to be this incessant need for art to have a hidden meaning to it and to make the observer think.   I enjoy the act of printmaking for what it is. Cutting a block allows my mind to rest and focus solely on the act of cutting. I pick my subject matter on what I think will be either interesting to carve or will be visually pleasing. At no time in my process do I consider social commentary, philosophical views or emotional issues as an influence of my work.  I am sure there are others who will be on the complete opposite on the spectrum of me. But I view printmaking as a craft in the first place.  It feels to me like your friend is lost in trying to add meaning to her work. If your message becomes more important than the visual aspects of your work, you might as well turn to the written word which is far more capable of conceiving a message."
printmaking,3b7020,Troglobitten,3,Fri Jun 26 15:15:14 2015 UTC,"Interesting! Came for recommendations, got philosophical debate.  Seriously though,  your comment has touched upon some of the stuff I'm studying in my own work (aesthetics and the history of philosophy), and I was hoping to respond to some of your claims before asking some questions that might be helpful to my original intent.  So, just to clarify, my printmaking-friend's work is not limited to actually printing.  She works at a print studio and is going to begin teaching classes soon. In addition to technique, she'd like to be able to seriously field any questions or discussions that might develop on the part of her students.  Furthermore, with her work schedule, she know longer has the time to just ""studio-out"" until inspiration or creativity falls out of the sky.  She wants to make the most of her personal studio hours by possessing a mature understanding of the history that has preceded her, so she can make some educated guesses as to how the field might be developing today.  To call this ""being lost,"" seems to me, hasty and unwarranted.  If we want to stick with the theory/practice dichotomy, it would be like me telling my colleagues (in philosophy) that they are lost for giving attention to the formal and technical aspects of their craft (written and spoken communication).  This would be silly because good theory borders on uselessness without good execution; and practice without thought is often repetitive and self-serving.  In fact you kinda hinted at how complicated the dichotomy is in your reply. You started off by saying that ""printmaking is just printmaking"" (as if that were a simple or informative - more on that later) and then moved on to describe two separate aspects of the process: 1) the working of the stone, wood, plate, etc. And 2) the selection of your subject-matter.   I pick my subject matter on what I think will be either interesting to carve or will be visually pleasing.   This might make you shudder, but it seems to me that you're already doing some aesthetic theorizing when you attempt this phase of your work. You make aesthetic judgments regarding what is and isn't ""interesting to carve""; and these judgements are likely reflective of your experience and intellectual background. This is not even to mention the complexities in the first phase you described, cutting the block. But anyway, moving on.   There seems to be this incessant need for art to have a hidden meaning to it and to make the observer think.   To argue from the opposite side, there seems to equally be a tendency to fetishize some vague sense of purity or accomplishment at dissociating from academic or systematic thinking about one's field of interest - as if something valuable were necessarily lost from seeking external input on what one is mentally-tinkering with. I tend to think that there are both good and bad ways to either overthink or underthink one's art-practice; but the broad brush characterization you gave about theorizing/philosophizing about printmaking seems, to me, misguided.  Now to some questions!:   I view printmaking as a craft in the first place.   What does does this mean? That is, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for an act to be considered ""printmaking""? And what does it mean to say that it was a craft in the first place?  Assuming that printmaking was originally a craft, does that mean that it should remain so?  To take an analogous example, film was first an exclusively visual medium. Then, with the advent of sound and the participation of a more diverse body of artists, it developed new themes, methods, and ideas.  By your argument, are we supposed to remain steadfast to the beginnings of an art-practice? Or is there something special about printmaking that should make this so?  Note: apologies for any typos. This was typed out on a mobile that sometimes refuses to cooperate.  Edit: I've been told (by printmakers incidentally) that sometimes I go ""too high, too fast."" That being said, if anything I've said is unclear, seemingly arbitrary, or just plain weird - please let me know. I'll do my best explain."
printmaking,3b7020,tonylinde,3,Sat Jun 27 15:42:11 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your lengthy reply. While I like to think I do not put any hidden meaning in my work, I still enjoy the exchange of opinions and philosophical viewpoints.  I'd like to point out that this was most definitely my own opinion heavily influenced by past experiences in the field of art. As soon as you start analyzing it, as you did, it will soon show how contradictory my statement really was. What I pick to be aesthetically pleasing or just happen to think of that could be fun to carve is a reflection of my state of mind at the time. My work is not and never will be void of emotion. The act of refusal to put more thought behind my work in itself is a philosophical viewpoint that I convey with my work.  I think where my true allergy lays is the snobbism i encountered in the art scene. I have encountered on many occasions the idea that the meaning is more important than the work itself. (when I say ""work"" I mean the execution and aesthetic value of the artform itself) It turned me off any creative endeavours for years because it took away all joy for me. (I'm aware that this was partly my own fault, I allowed other peoples opinion to influence my own experience. Something I have managed to overcome just recently) I got sick and tired of the mental masturbation and one upmanship while all I wanted was to experience joy in what I do.  It is true that others use printmaking as a vessel to express their ideas, but to me there is no message I am actively trying to convey.  Now about the whole ""printmaking as a craft""   What does does this mean? That is, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for an act to be considered ""printmaking""? And what does it mean to say that it was a craft in the first place?   My interpretation of the word craft might be narrow, but it might be a necessity for the sake of discussion. Printmaking goes so far back in time, that the meaning of what defines art and what defines a craft has evolved considerably. In my context I see a craft as a technical skill of which the result should be taken at face value without any secondary meaning.   I will admit that, to me personally, the idea of utilizing ""outdated"" methods speaks to me. But I wouldn't see this as part of what defines a craft. I make woodcuts , the oldest form of printing. There is however a lot more to printmaking that reflects the evolution of the craft. So I wouldn't say that printmaking as a craft is limited to the early forms."

On craft:   My interpretation of the word craft might be narrow, but it might be a necessity for the sake of discussion . . . In my context I see a craft as a technical skill of which the result should be taken at face value without any secondary meaning.   I've only heard about craft, in this sense, in conversation. Are there any books or articles that you could recommend about the divide (however rough) between craft and ""fine"" or ""symbolic"" art? Are there any must-reads in the scholarship about craft?"
printmaking,3b7020,erinalexa,3,Sun Jun 28 16:52:08 2015 UTC,"Talking about ukiyo-e reminded me that David Bull has a lot to say on the subject.  http://www.woodblock.com/front.html His website isn't the easiest to navigate, but probably contains lots of references to other sources on the subject  http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~xs3d-bull/overview/overview.html This page contains some of his own views on the subject that I think are very interesting"
printmaking,3b7020,ashenputtel,2,Sun Jun 28 17:36:16 2015 UTC,"Well it was sort of my own interpretation, so I don't know if anyone has actually done research on this specific view.  It could be worth it to look into art history itself, and read up on how art evolved from craft to art. If an egyptian sculptor was commissioned to build a statue of Ra. The statue itself would be seen as a work of art with its own symbolism and meaning whereas for the sculptor itself it would just be technical execution of his craft.  In the case of printmaking, I would highly encourage you to read up on Japanese woodblock printing like Ukiyo-e. A run of prints would be commissioned by a publisher, designed by an artist, cut by a carver and printed by a printer.   I can not give you any specific sources, it's just interesting tidbits I picked up here and there. If you do ever expand on the divide between art and craft I would be very interested in hearing more about it."
printmaking,3b7020,dizzymizzy,2,Sun Jun 28 17:23:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm becoming much more interested in the divide between craft and art.  I can't say it's addressed at length in the literature my research focuses on.  In some ways, it reminds me of the divide between music composition and performance. Both come with their own interpretative demands, but people tend to look at the latter as more passive (or even less creative) than the former. This is a mistake.  To me, it seems that printmaking is craft-oriented in the sense that it places meaningful weight on the process of producing the work. In printmaking, a work can be thematically bankrupt and still be good by virtue of its smooth gradients and precise registers. This is sometimes so in other media, but I haven't seen it with so much consistency as it appears in printmaking.  I think this also gives some insight to the stress on ""community"" that is common in printmaking. Community is important for printmaking because printmakers are at a unique advantage when it comes to evaluating the work of their peers. They know the processes and this adds to their receptions of one another's work. They also work together to complete large scale projects.  They can infer the process leading up to the work in a way that the uninitiated cannot.  I take it that this is part of what separates craft from art."

You always print your layer first onto the acetate, then slide your paper underneath the acetate (the underside of the acetate is clean). This shows you exactly where your layer will be printed on the page, and it is super helpful for CMYK prints.

printmaking,38d8yf,ThyHolyPope,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:49:58 2015 UTC,"Herd to tell entirely what's going on, but it looks like your ink might be too think (which would slow drying) so my first suggestion would be to tone that down.   Something else you could do is to throw some (just a schmidge) cobalt drier into your ink with will quicken your drying times (it's toxic so wear gloves)   also I've found the thinner the fabric the quicker it dries, when I printed on muslin it dried basically overnight, when I printed on a Tshirt it took like 3-4 weeks to dry (dunno why the disparity, but haven't investigated it too much."
printmaking,38d8yf,kappanjoe,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:41:41 2015 UTC,I second the cobalt drier. I literally never print oil ink without it.
printmaking,38d6mf,AGuyFromCincy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:29:42 2015 UTC,"Let them keep drying.  Depending on the ink,  you may also be able to place a smooth scrap fabric over the top and iron to help heat-set it."
printmaking,384s9o,squidpasta,3,Mon Jun 1 21:17:38 2015 UTC,"That sounds normal to me. Metallic inks are probably one of the most frustrating things to print with (unless letterpress or screenprinting) I usually cut mine with with extender, mag, some heavy plate oil, PLUS another ink (usually a tad of white) and I make a shit ton and save what I don't use. And even then, it wont always work.   If you have money to burn, go buy an older can of metallic letterpress ink, and that will probably work straight out of the can better than anything you can mix on your own. (In my experience anyways, and I like mixing ink. Metallics are just that much of a bitch)"

Play around a lot and be prepared for lots of incorrect mixing in the beginning. You'll get it eventually. Different metallics go best with different colors. Silver gets mixed with blue a little better than white, while gold get better with.... well not sure. The only metallics I print with are silver and copper."

The photos are always at an angle, or semi poorly lit, or are of incomplete work still in progress; I save the good photos for my website only.  You may gain less accolades from the poorer quality photos, but they'll be sufficient for troubleshooting/ critique. Also Reddit can be kind of fickle when it comes to self- promotion, you may get some jeers for linking to your personal website... I don't know if that kind of thing bothers you.  You also need to be careful about how much personal info you post on Reddit. Accidentally piss- off some asshole in a random sub and you might find yourself doxxed or your website attacked, you never know what creepy people are capable of."
printmaking,37rmug,churchofsanta,3,Fri May 29 21:20:01 2015 UTC,"If you don't want your work reproduced, don't upload any high resolution images to any public website ever. It's that simple really :p  If people want to find art to rip off, they would actually be more likely to look for it in places where they can find artwork i.e. artist communities.  For people to rip off your stuff uploaded to imgur, they would have to run into it to begin with. And that is as likely to happen as people seeing your post on reddit.  I like imgur because it allows you to link directly to an image, and in case somehow your image goes viral it won't bring down your website or cost you a ton in bandwidth.  In the end, if you want people to see your work, they can rip it. Any sort of theft prevention such as watermarks will just do injustice to your work (personal opinion) At best you can add a reference to your site at the foot of the image. That way, in case someone reposts it you will be credited."
printmaking,37rmug,Troglobitten,4,Fri May 29 21:58:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly in my opinion, I like links to imgur. That's mostly because they're often easier to navigate, straight to the point and no bullshit. Also I'm mostly a mobile user so it's easier for me to flick thru your pics on imgur rather than hope that your site is easy to go thru on an iPhone. Do I really care about self promotion, due to website vs imgur... Nah it's all an ease of use kinda thing. if I like what you show, and I want to see more then I'll put up with navigating your site."

I've had pretty good feedback on my mobile site but yeah, ease of use is a huge consideration and I can see why not having imgur links would be a pain.  Imgur is just so foreign to me right now that I'm having a sort of... reverse problem since I'm not used to it!  Ahaha."
printmaking,37rmug,ThyHolyPope,1 point,Sat May 30 01:23:50 2015 UTC,"The only problem I had at first was getting the thumbnail to show up right, because it's always the first picture you upload, even if you change the order later on. Also if the image size is to big it might not show a thumbnail.... And if you don't have a thumbnail the odds of your post getting traction go down.   Also it's not that artist websites are particularly difficult to navigate, it's just they are each different, often take SLIGHTLY longer to load/navigate, which In the internet age can mean the difference between hitting the back button or spending a minute looking at your work. I've had a picture ripped off imgur and rehosted before, but whatever, if people want to steal your stuff their going to do it, just like music/software, pirates gonna pirate."

printmaking,37ma6b,GnomeRobot,2,Thu May 28 19:59:12 2015 UTC,"Wrong subreddit, but /u/BusinessHugs gave you the right ones.  That being said I do use 3D printing and teach workshops for it so the best thing I can say is up your print quality and slow down your speed.  It's going to take WAY longer to print anything but you'll get a high quality print from it.  Check to see if you can find the setting that changes the layer height.  Adjusting that to be as minimal as possible will also give you a cleaner print.  Most finishing comes from doing editing post-printing such as sanding, acetone wiping, and heating.  There are other techniques but everything really depends on the type of print and what material you're using to print with.  Good luck!"

printmaking,36je4b,TFadam,2,Tue May 19 20:41:14 2015 UTC,If you decide to tube your prints make sure to put them in a square box.  Two layers of cardboard is always a good idea and while the tube is a very strong shape it will often roll around and can get crushed that way.  The post in the states only sells square 'mailing tubes' now.  Another tip for cardboard is to pay attention to the 'grain' of it.  If you layer two pieces with the corrugation going in perpendicular directions it has much greater strength than if they are running the same way.

printmaking,364w2q,ashenputtel,3,Sat May 16 13:44:37 2015 UTC,"Before you print onto the fabric, you need to add tons of starch so that you can get it to hold its shape. Glue the back of it with water-soluble glue to a piece of cardstock. If you're printing with a press, you need to put HARD packing between the fabric and the top of the press to get even pressure. If you're not the middle of the image printed, maybe put a little piece of paper or two the size of the unprinted section underneath the lino--sometimes a few paper thicknesses makes the difference. Keep adding little pieces of paper to push up the middle until you get even pressure."
printmaking,364w2q,meLIZZZZZma,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"My best success with printing Lino on fabric is using a press. Hand printing will not give you enough pressure to make a print transfer on to any fabric that is as thick or thicker than cotton Tshirt material. Thin material like silk may be better to hand press. Higher pressure on a press (more than what you would use to print on paper) with stiff backing (uncorrigated cardboard, or mat board works well) will get the best, most permanent result. If you are printing with water based fabric ink, it may be challenging because the nature of the ink is to dry faster and so will not transfer as well. Oil based ink + ink dryer mixed in will be the best for appearance and durability. I wouldn't use a board to add pressure, as it will disperse the pressure out, and will end up being less pressure."

printmaking,35wnd8,cvbm,3,Thu May 14 03:11:33 2015 UTC,Are you printing on a press or by hand? It looks to me like you went a little thin/uneven on your ink and/or pressure when printing. The fish are really cool looking!
printmaking,35wnd8,ryans1286,2,Thu May 14 18:01:07 2015 UTC,"Try using a large wooden spoon and rubbing the back side of the paper while it's on the block in a circular motion with very firm pressure. It takes practice to get an even pressure, but your prints will come out nicer.   Edit: Based on the way you printed those, I bet you used more ink than you needed, but relatively little was actually picked up. My under inking thought was based on it running through a press."
printmaking,35wnd8,ryans1286,2,Fri May 15 01:36:12 2015 UTC,"If you want to spend a little extra, getting a good baren is nice too!  I have carpel tunnel and find that the spoons, while good in a pinch, are a bit of a stress for me to use repeatedly.  The baren I've had a lot more ease of use with and I feel that the pressure level is easier to control.  If you do go for a spoon, look for one that has a flat bottom.  You can usually find these at grocery stores.  The flat bottom will give you a smoother print that doesn't have little streaks from the curved bottom of a normal spoon!"

printmaking,35vk9k,lmdw,1 point,Wed May 20 18:41:46 2015 UTC,"Key differences are size, resolution and input. The older ones functioned like a copier only, the newer ones have RIPs and network cards installed. Many older models print at 300dpi, newer ones at 600dpi.  Top of the line models have two color drums, which can be used at the same time... a ledger size Z drum can run anywhere from $550 to $850, and you'll need one for each color you'd want to print.  Smaller drums and consumables are obviously a lot cheaper.  All things considered, I think a RZ390 UI is a good compromise, but of course I don't know what you're looking for..."

I think I'd be fine with 300dpi and it 'just' having a copy mode. I like the analog-ness of that. Not that I wouldn't enjoy the RIP and higher DPI, but for having some fun doing some DIY lo-fi printmaking, I almost thing the less bells and whistles, the better.  For now, I guess I'm wondering what the availability of supplies are for these printers. Are they still being made today? If I manage to find one, do I need to try and stockpile as much ink as possible before they go by the way side ala the Gocco?"

Just put the shirts over a stiff board and take a picture of the graphic, then in photoshop, separate out the colors, eliminate the background shirt jersey image, and you should be able to get the graphic isolated.  If you have lots of time on your hands, you can even push it through illustrator and turn it into a vector file but I feel that would change the ""quality"" of the image.  You can also do some photoshop touch ups to fix any areas that might be worn or where the ink has flaked off or cracked... but nowadays that is often seen as a nice feature to keep... like a ""vintage look"" thing."

Once the image was bitten we washed off the bitumen and the plate was ready to print then.

If you're just using them for waterless you shouldn't need to grain them, just hit them with some emory paper and it'll work. I had a fellow student who managed to pull waterless prints off the back of a ball grained plate without doing anything to the printing surface prior.

Wetting and inking up the plates will be the same way like how you would do with a stone.  After care... Use tartar control tooth paste to clean off the ink in the lines, and you can store it for keeping."

printmaking,32pxjs,jonaggeddon,2,Wed Apr 15 19:40:09 2015 UTC,"It depends on how big your halftone dots are. My advice would be try to use the highest mesh count you can whenever you can. But it would be more important if you were printing a tonal photograph than if you were doing a black and white comic style drawing.  I have found half tones to be challenging when the positive is not flush with the screen when exposing it: small halftone dots being slightly separated from the emulsion will create an undercut of light and will not wash out.  There can also be a significant difference in the results if your emulsion coating is thicker/thinner You may need to try burning the screen a few times to make the right match. When you find the right combo of halftone dot size, angle, emulsion coating thickness, mesh count, and exposure time, make sure to write it down! Happy printing."

The tracks are from the master not being inked up 100% and the stencil being a little clogged, technically its time for a replacement, but I like it this way."

printmaking,30y61f,flowithego,9,Tue Mar 31 17:37:50 2015 UTC,"I think you'll have a lot more luck with silkscreen. If you're printing on the box before it's folded, Silkscreen should be perfect for this. If you use a block print method, you'll ended up embossing the cardboard somewhat. Possibly in a distorted way depending on what your block looks like and if how you end up printing. Most products that you see that come printed will either be offset litho or some form of silkscreen. A lot of boxes that are professionally printed are done so with an offer method or silkscreen."
printmaking,30y61f,bohawkn,3,Tue Mar 31 17:51:02 2015 UTC,This. Most companies and studios would use screen printing. You can run screens a lot faster than wood blocks too.
printmaking,30y61f,austinoneal88,2,Tue Mar 31 20:43:33 2015 UTC,Truth.  It is also going to be really difficult to print woodblock on cardboard successfully without access to a press.  I'd definitely go with silkscreen.
printmaking,30y61f,Andrea1029,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:14:18 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why I didn't think of this, since I actually know how to do screen printing as well...   Provided the screen is large enough, I can have the logo in a variety of sizes and apply it to different sized boxes, too!   How about the ink/paint though? I can't remember which type of paint we used back in college, I need something that can withstand handling and transport - don't want it delivered smudged or peeling/cracking (though cracking would look awesome)."
printmaking,30y61f,DirtyLithography,4,Wed Apr 1 00:19:26 2015 UTC,"Use water based ink. Peeling and cracking would more be an issue with plastisol (a type of ink commonly used for print on t-shirts/ garments).   Speedball, Jaquard, TW Graphic are a handful of companies out there for ink.  Speedball makes photo emulsion called Diazo (green stuff), that will do the job but isn't great for large runs. If you're having to print more than say, 100 boxes in one go I'd go with Glide (blue stuff).   If you need pointers on registration exposure and all that fun stuff feel free to DM me."

printmaking,30ibsb,copyimage,2,Fri Mar 27 16:57:27 2015 UTC,"Based on my experience working in engraving/signmaking/heat transfer printing/etc. for over a decade, the methods for printing on latex are pretty limited, and I don't think it's likely that regular inkjet from a home printer is likely to work. I imagine you'll want to look at solvent inks, like they use for printing on vinyl banners, as the solvent bites into the latex ever so slightly and sets it into the surface. In fact, you may even want to call a local manner maker or sign shop and ask them about it, they may have printed on latex sheeting. Here's a similar question."
printmaking,30ibsb,formermormon,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:02:22 2015 UTC,What substrate are you printing the inkjet on? What size?  I would suggest the hand sanitizer method but I would be concerned about the alcohol content damaging your latex sheeting.

printmaking,2zgmoz,ThyHolyPope,0,Wed Mar 18 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"this is a nice project, but why is it not succeeding? let's look at the facts.   the ""nothing"" tier for donations starts at 5 dollars. if you give them five dollars you get nothing. not blog access, no digital download of a cellphone background sized version of the art. Nothing. supposedly you get good vibes, but even then they want no less than a fiver for those vibes.   for 10$ you get a patch.  the next jump is 12$ for a sticker pack of three. so 4$ a piece for 3 stickers.   next 15$ for a 5"" X 7"" print. so, a 15$ postcard.   20$ for stickers and a patch.  25$ for a screenprint  and then we get into the meat of this endeavor, the 30$ t-shirts. the 60$ hoodie.   it also appears impossible to get just a waterbottle.  this is kind of unreasonable even if you consider the cost of shipping. everything on the kickstarter is significantly more expensive than a locally available alternative, for not a significant upgrade in quality, things like patches and stickers are inexpensive to ship too.  the lack of a 1$, starting the Nothing tier at more than that always strikes me as greedy, this is the tier for the people who love you, your friends and family who want to show their support even if they don't want a thing. this is the tier for people who want to keep an eye on the project and commit to buying a thing after it's in production and it's a safe bet.  at 5$ you should get one sticker, makes the 12$ tier look reasonable because now if you want two, it makes getting three for an extra 2$ look reasonable.  the other red flag is that I don't see any discussion of shipping costs. kickstarters that don't talk abut shipping are kickstarters that end up not fulfilling their obligations. especially first-timers.  the other question I have is why 15,000$ ? I get that they need that money to outfit a store, but if they set the goal to 100$ are they still capable of producing the products? because I don't live in Michigan, I'm not going to Michigan, I only care that I get my thing, the kickstarter should be about production costs of the things it sells, not about some other goal.  anyways, I predict either failure or a large donation from grandma or the person themselves at the last minute. it looks pretty, but they are committing the cardinal sin of treating kickstarter like a PBS pledge drive and not like a way to sell things to customers."
printmaking,2zgmoz,pencilears,5,Wed Mar 18 18:55:44 2015 UTC,"Well... if by failure you mean she's raised over half her funds in less than half her allotted time, and is well on her way to reaching her goal, then yah your correct, this is a failure :/   And IMO, i think there are essentially 2 ways of looking at Kickstarter  1) looking at it as a store front. this train of thought is basically, ""I want to sell my product for $X, so instead of selling it myself, i'll put it on kickstarter for $X which will increase my potential customer base."" So the Customer gets the product for the ""normal"" cost, and the supplier gets the sale at the ""normal"" cost minus about 10% (kickstarter fees)  2) Looking at it as a way to donating money to someone you like/ believe in to achieve something that would otherwise be financially unattainable, and you can receive a gift as a tiered pledge. I honestly think this is the way kickstarter should be used. The pledges shouldn't be seen as a ""i'm just going to pick this item up and check out"" it should be seen as using your wallet to say ""I believe in you."" and the gift is seen as a ""thanks for believing in me.""  if its merely a commerce platform, just make a site and sell your shit thru etsy, or whatever. I mean its a crowdfunding service, its all about fundraising, do you go a charity banquet and complain that the meal didn't really cost $25 to make, no because the money is going toward a cause you believe in. if you don't care about the project don't back it simple as that.   this is a FUNDRAISING platform..... you know to RAISE FUNDS.   As for your outrage about lack of shipping prices. Since you see kickstarter as simply a store front lets look at the 30 Dollar Pledge.... you get a T shirt. Ok, so Its a hand made relief printed Tshirt, I sell the exact same thing in my shop for $25 bucks, You know how much i Typically pay in shipping fees and materials? about 5 bucks. know what that equals? about 30 bucks. all because she don't have shipping prices, doesn't mean she hasn't figured them in. Hoesntly the only issue i have with that is she screws herself over if she has any international orders... but you can turn international shipping off."

My advice to you is to work fast, scrape dry ink away, and keep a cup of water handy to dip your palette knife into to mix into your ink. It won't dilute it too much and it keeps it soft and workable."
printmaking,2z1ej7,TACOUNT,3,Sat Mar 14 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"My experience with water based inks is that they are really difficult to print anything more than a couple of prints, and they don't look as good as oil based inks anyway. The extra little bit of cleanup time is definitely worth the results you get from oil based inks. If you clean up with veg. oil (or baby oil) followed by alcohol to degrease it's pretty quick anyway."

When you need it, drop a bead of ink with a brush across your slab and roll it out. Do this for each pass.   Also, I've heard of people putting a tiny amount of glycerine or Golden Acrylic paint retarder in their ink. By tiny I mean <5% of total ink mixed. Be warned that retarders won't work if your ink is gum arabic based (though glycerine might, run some test prints). Make sure you know what base your ink is as it may be soy based. Also, retarders can affect the transparency of your ink so mix accordingly."

I love that you're doing some shirts as well as wall prints. The good news is, you're doing a lot of things right that beginners often totally miss! Your pictures look great, and you've got the policies all filled out. Social media and promotion outside etsy is really important for bringing people to your shop; I use instagram as well. Hashtag those posts (in a comment to the post) to help in search. On etsy itself, work on your tags. It's usually better to use tags that are two or three words -- like ""window print"" instead of ""windows"", so your audience will be more targeted, and you'll be more ""relevant"" and show up higher. As you add more listings, you'll get more traffic!"

Etsy is primarily our path for selling more minor prints, their low fees, ease of use, etc make it attractive. Most of the $20-$40 items will be coming down however in the next month or two, as we're going to sell them via a local printmaking collaborative's annual $20 sale.  To be honest, most of my sales come from people googling him.  I would recommend joining some of the fine art teams on Etsy. I have also made sales based on my tags, so I'd double down on those. Finally, having as many pieces as possible increases your ability to be found on Etsy. I'm down into the 80's in terms of numbers, but would like to get back to 100 or so."

You can also buy a wooden handle for your speedball blades.  I've heard good things about the Pfeil tools too.

printmaking,2yjvcm,sbloyd,2,Wed Mar 11 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"Wow, yeah The only reason you should ever use the speedball tool is if you are just trying out Lino for the first time, I would say if you are planning to do anymore then just one project on a 12x12  linoleum then you should really consider buying different tools. A good place to start is with E. C Lyons they have a good kit of a few basic ""u"" and ""v"" gouges. The the Lyons tools are more of a European traditional style where the tool fits squarely in the palm of your hand allowing for really precise cuts forward. The other tools that another person suggested are really good as well and they are the Japanese style. the cutting technic you would use with those tools is a bit different, I would say probably more advanced but you can always cut the handles down and use them in your palm.  If you are stuck using the speedball I would make sure to have a piece of leather by your side to sharpen your blades as it will make a huge difference. I again would really recommend buying the individual tools if you think you have a real desire to get into Lino and woodblock. The difference between speedball and the Lyons is like trying to scoop out rock hard ice cream with a spoon vs. cutting through butter with a hot knife.   http://www.eclyons.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=10&products_id=189&zenid=t3rhmm0l4nud8r5ad554bkla82 if you are interested"

printmaking,2yjvcm,meLIZZZZZma,1 point,Wed Mar 11 14:02:25 2015 UTC,I have speedball lino tools. I've used and loved the same tools for probably 4 years. They are inexpensive and easy to replace tips. I'd recommend them to any beginner or expert.  I have mcclains tools for woodcutting. I sometimes use my speedball tools on wood if the wood is being difficult. My mcclains gouges are heaven and I've had them for the same amount of time. But I keep a wetstone sharpener handy for them because the wood dulls them faster than lino.

I've even seen tacky ink pull up chunks of linoleum after being cleaned with alcohol.  The reason is because linoleum is made by mixing linseed oil with cork and superfine sawdust (or wood flour) and pressing it into a sheet. Basically, the denatured alcohol will dissolve the linseed oil that is binding the linoleum together, allowing it fall apart.   Mineral spirits Vegetable oil would should work, however.   edit: Mineral spirits might not actually be the best choice. I've had success cleaning linoleum with vegetable oil though."

If you're interested in learning more the best resource out there is probably alternativephotography.com. The process is pretty easy to learn, especially for cyanotypes and van Dyke Brown prints. I also learned gum-bichromate which is a more intensive process, but it can produce some really amazing stuff.  The way I did this print in particular was first making a digital negative using photoshop, that get's printed onto a transparency sheet. Before I coated the paper I used a paper cutter to cut it into strips, which I then weaved back together. I then coated it in a mixture of Cyanotype A&B and put it in the printmaker for around 600 units, not sure how long that is in real time. I washed it and bleached it a little to give it a more faded look around the edges."

printmaking,2wjlr1,dria,8,Fri Feb 20 13:20:45 2015 UTC,"Your problem may be with your ink-  In order to layer ink well, you need to make sure you aren't over inking your block. Make sure your ink slab is lean: when you roll your ink, that static sound that happens (called ""kissing"") should sound more like a drizzle than a storm. You should also be able to see the difference between the texture of an over inked slab and the texture of an appropriately inked slab. Over inking your slab looks like streaks and pulls up the ink as you roll it out making little mountains and canyons, and this will make a louder noise. A lean slab should have no streaks, your ink slab should look like what you want your printed layer to look like. Make sure that you build up the ink on your block with a few rolls of the brayer, instead of trying to get the entire thing covered in one go. Try using an ""ink well"", meaning a strip of ink, that you pick up small amounts of with your roller. Build up the slab from too little ink to the right amount. When you roll up your block, do the same: build up from too little to enough.  If you ink the block well, your layers should rest smoothly on top of each other.  A second problem may be with the type of ink. If it is a water based ink, it may dry faster, maybe even drying out your slab or your block before it's ready to be printed. A partially dried block will not print well. Drying  ink may also cause one to compensate by adding more ink, which will lead to the problems I mentioned. (Not to mention other problems like filling in cut away areas). If you mix an ink extender base to your ink, it should prevent drying. If you use an oil based ink (my personal preference, as the ink consistency is definitely the best for lean slabs, vibrancy, and multiple layers), or a soy based ink (akua inks don't dry until they are on an absorbent surface like paper, and clean up is safer than oil ink clean up) you shouldn't have these problems unless you over ink.  Make sure,finally, that you aren't using too much pressure, as embossment of the paper may change the way the next layers are printed.  Hope that's helpful! Good luck & happy printing!"
printmaking,2wjlr1,meLIZZZZZma,1 point,Fri Feb 20 15:20:07 2015 UTC,I completely agree that ink amount and ink type are the two best places to start. That being said I'd like to clear up a bit of a misconception for everyone...soy based inks are still oil based - just a different type of oil. Soy oil = from soybean plants VS Conventional/Petroleum oil = from dinosaurs.
printmaking,2wjlr1,HancoInk,1 point,Mon Feb 23 18:46:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed on oils vs water, however to my knowledge: Aqua inks are soy based, but clean up with water. (From your slab and your block, not your hands or clothes). However they are primarily used for etching, and I don't know of any way to thicken them."
printmaking,2wjlr1,meLIZZZZZma,1 point,Mon Feb 23 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"Akua inks are water based, not soy based. They may have some soy content, but the majority of the vehicle is water. Anything you may do to thicken Akua inks will make them less able to be washed up with water.  Edit: Them being primarily water is just my understanding. Who am I to say? We don't make it."
printmaking,2wjlr1,HancoInk,2,Thu Feb 26 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"I've never used these inks so I can't speak from experience, but it sounds like you might need to wait longer between printing layers. If the ink on the paper feels tacky, the block could be picking up some of it when you print another layer on top. Also, consider how thick your ink is when you roll it out. I've seen some printmakers roll super thick, but they can't get more than one or two layers as a result because the ink will start to behave weird. So if you want to do multi layer, just make sure the roll out is pretty thin and even."
printmaking,2wjlr1,Junohandy,2,Fri Feb 20 15:04:05 2015 UTC,"When multiple blocks are printing colour on the same spot, previous layers of ink can end up sealing off the paper surface from the colours printed later. As one often wants the superimposed colours to interact rather than obliterate each other, one can add a step to the process of printing the earlier layers. After each earlier colour is printed, while the ink is still fresh, layer the prints with a clean newsprint sheet between and run the stack through the press under blankets only with a light to medium pressure--no heroics required. The interleaving sheets are then removed (with their inky ghosts) and the prints printed with the next colour, stored or dried -- whatever you would do normally. If the 'ghosts' are really not very ghostlike and yet the impressions are still nice and vivid, that would be a definite hint that you can get away with a leaner roll."

printmaking,2wics3,losthalo7,0,Fri Feb 20 03:29:14 2015 UTC,I think you may need to work on your plate wiping technique a bit..
printmaking,2wiy9u,Malfunkdung,4,Fri Feb 20 07:16:24 2015 UTC,"Are you using speedball water-based ink and burnishing with a spoon?  What is the size of your block?  In my experience the water-based ink works best for small images (under 4""x 4"").  If the image is larger i've had issues with the ink drying too fast.  Speedball does sell a retarder to slow the drying time which can be helpful.  Ultimately I find that oil-based ink makes printing go a lot better.  It can be cleaned up with non-toxic materials- I use a mixture of 15% Veggie oil, 10% dish soap, and 75% water that works wonderfully.  A little household cleaner like Simple Green cleans up any residue.  Congrats on your first print, it's addicting!  Best of luck moving forward."
printmaking,2wiy9u,TweeterMonkeyMan,1 point,Fri Feb 20 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"I used speedball fabric block printing ink, which is oil based. Size of the block is 6 x 9in. The print on red is a shirt the other is on regular copy paper. I did use a spoon on the paper to burnish but not on the shirt. Do I need to use the same method on shirt prints?"
printmaking,2wiy9u,TweeterMonkeyMan,2,Fri Feb 20 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"It looks like the shirt image came out pretty well.  For the paper image, I think part of it might be the paper- copy paper is not the best for printing, I would recommend something a little thicker and more absorbent (and archival).  Rives BFK is a pretty nice standard paper.  Sure it costs a little more, but you are making works of art, not xeroxes, so it is worth it to use fine art paper.  With an oil-based ink like you are using you should be able to get a solid print with spoon burnishing.  I recommend burnishing in areas and checking as you work- ink the block and place the paper on it, holding it securely with one hand burnish an area with the spoon in the other.  Keeping the paper held firmly down to the block, peel up the area you burnished and examine how things are printing.  If there are light spots burnish over those areas a little more.  Repeat this process for all areas of the block.  If a spot is under-inked, you can even carefully peel the paper off that area and roll a little more ink in before lowering the paper and burnishing.  Keep tinkering and you'll get the results you desire!"
printmaking,2wiy9u,TweeterMonkeyMan,2,Sat Feb 21 05:33:40 2015 UTC,"Ultimately it is important to remember that you are making a hand-made work of art.  A little unevenness is part of the magic, that is some of what makes it distinct from commercial reproduction."

printmaking,2wiy9u,Feather_fingers,3,Sat Feb 21 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"i really like using oil-based ink, just because it gives me a good amount of time to work with it before drying. water-based ink is the worst. thin paper, like rice paper, also helps."
printmaking,2wiy9u,fistasaverb,2,Fri Feb 20 15:17:36 2015 UTC,"It looks great!  I am still very much a beginner, but I have been warned that water based paint is not the best thing to use. My wife and I printed Christmas cards and we chose the wrong paper and the wrong ink.  Lately, I have been printing with rubber-based ink and it makes a big difference."

But we printed the block with a steamroller. I printed two on 100% cotton fabric, and one on canvas. We used Gamblin oil based relief ink.

printmaking,2uxto5,abcdiana,3,Fri Feb 6 01:56:39 2015 UTC,"Getting rollermarks to show up on their plates? Do you want them or to get rid of them?  I'm going to assume you want to get rid of them, and the first thing you need to look at is how you are using your roller.  Try and use a roller that can cover the whole surface of the image without going over itself, with a circumference that's longer than the image.  If you dont have one big enough, make sure you arent just rolling from one direction, apply ink from all sides of the plate.  make sure your last rolls each time you ink up are hard and fast, if you are just using a black leather roller you can be surprisingly hard on a plate, and this can help pick up excess ink.  Apart from roller technique the amount of water left on the plate is important, too much is just as bad as too little, remember, two sponges, one wet, one dry, use wet to apply lots of water to the plate then use your dry one to pick most of it up, just leaving a thin film."
printmaking,2uxto5,Poduler,3,Fri Feb 6 02:04:55 2015 UTC,"thank you so much.  this is really helpful.  i was looking to get rid of roller marks, sorry for being unclear.  i don't think my studio has any rollers that large, and we definitely don't have leather ones – but i think my problem might be leaving too much water on the plate.  when i was using polyester plates the mixed gum never spread when i dropped it on the plate.  with the paper it looks like it spreads and pools.  i must have way too much water on my plate.  we've been applying water with spray bottles – not sponges.  i guess that's allowed me to get carried away with wetting the plate.  thanks a lot again for your advice!"
printmaking,2uxto5,Poduler,3,Fri Feb 6 02:56:52 2015 UTC,"No worries, it shouldn't matter with the size of the roller, having one big enough is just ideal, as long as you apply it from all directions it should be fine.  With the sponges, they can be really helpful in cleaning up ink off non image areas as well, don't just use normal dish sponges though, as they will just frey and disturb ink where it should stick to the plate, use ones that look like this.  Specific ones for litho can be expensive, I use the ones made by Takach Press because they last for a really long time. I generally try to have someone sponging down the plate while i roll up.  Also if you keep having trouble with the lines, try misting your paper with the water bottle before you print, it'll stop it picking up the really fine areas of ink like rollermarks.  Also, if you are looking to seriously pursue Lithography i would recomend  buying a copy of this Its by far the most comprehensive and usable text on generating flawless prints."

printmaking,2uhbkb,kathx,2,Mon Feb 2 04:08:50 2015 UTC,"Was it a brand new screen? Always wash new screens or remeshed screens before you print.   Try putting a small dab (as in less than 5 percent of your total ink) of glycerin or acrylic paint retarder in your ink to help with the sticking and ALWAYS back flood between prints if you're using water based inks. Otherwise, you'll paying to have your screens remeshed every time you reclaim a screen.   Be certain to let your emulsion dry all the way before exposing. Especially if you're using diazo (the green stuff). The reason being is that if not fully dried all the way you won't get a proper exposure and thus won't be able to remove the emulsion, ruining your screen. If in doubt about your exposure time with photo-emulsion, cook it for longer.  Really though, don't be disheartened by mistakes or accidents, think of serigraphy as litho with half the frustration. We used to call it ""litho without the tears"" at my university."

printmaking,2uhbkb,artfart,1 point,Fri Feb 6 02:39:49 2015 UTC,"Yes it was a new screen, and I did make sure to clean it extremely well in the process leading up to the printing! Thanks very much for your reply, and the litho thing made me laugh, I assumed it would be as much. I think  some of my problem is I'm not very used to printing without a press. I've done woodblocks and Linocuts but those you can print with a spoon if need be. Applying the pressure myself proved to be harder than I thought. Also not used to the ink. It's very runny and I didn't really handle it all too well. Thanks again for your advice, I'll make sure to write it all down in my notes for the future!"
printmaking,2uhbkb,DirtyLithography,1 point,Mon Feb 2 06:54:18 2015 UTC,Yeah the dexterity was the hardest part for me to learn. Especially figuring out that different inks have different consistencies and require different amounts of pressure. I also found that wen taping my edges that using masking tape rather than packaging tape keeping me from hanging up.
printmaking,2uhbkb,artfart,2,Mon Feb 2 20:08:45 2015 UTC,"Buy aluminum Screens. Ditch wooden screens. Apply emulsion on both sides, regardless of what your professor says. Buy a good scoop coater and keep it clean and the edge free of dings. You can use water based fabric ink on both fabric and paper.  You can expose with a 500 watt halogen light with ULANO TZ Photo Emulsion. Keep your light source 1.5x the length of your long side of your screen. From bottom to top: Black Foam Board - Screen (image side up) - Art work - Glass - Light source. Wash your screen out gently with luke warm water.  Tape your edges before your print. When you print, follow this method:  Screen up-> flood -> screen down -> print -> screen up -> flood. With water based, you NEVER want you image to be exposed to air. ALWAYS keep it flooded. Always always.  When you are done, remove as much ink as possible with a a thin piece of card stock. ALWAYS remove your tape before you start to wash it out. REASON:  Certain glues are prone to temperature change. If you apply water with tape on the scree, the glue can get thick and start to Booger up. You don't want boogers.  Hope this helps."
printmaking,2uhbkb,doublen00b,1 point,Mon Feb 2 04:51:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice, this helped a lot. I will make sure to write all of this down as well. I was not particularly graceful when flooding the screen and I think that was probably a problem, that and I wasn't putting enough pressure, or even pressure when I went to print. The way the ink was so runny really threw me off, I'm just not used to it and I don't think I did a very good job handling in it in the printing process. I will be sure to flood more efficiently and hopefully with practice I'll get better at handling the ink. Thanks for your reply!"
printmaking,2uhbkb,Existentialist,1 point,Mon Feb 2 06:58:42 2015 UTC,When you use a 500w halogen what's your exposure time? I tried using one recently and it just didn't seem to work well for me. I was using a 14x20 screen with the light source about 24 inches away. I tried 12 minutes it didn't burn in at all. I went to wash and the whole thing came out.   Meanwhile my regular incandescent setup (200w) works well but it takes like 25-30 minutes.

Don't let it discourage you, it's not really like getting a job at a print shop is super easy, most people hire people they know/ have worked with before so unless you find a random shop that hires people without experience your gonna have a hard time. I'm gonna assume you have a BFA, the problem is.... Everyone has a BFA, so it sounds shitty, but that degree means jack shit. It's all about your portfolio, your personality, and who you know.

I have used it for relief printing but not etching, though the reviews on the Blick site and at WetCanvas indicate that it does just fine for that, and I believe it would.

The press itself is 48 lbs which made it possible to ship via FedEx and it isn't too horrible to move it around my house if need be.   For me, it's a huge step up from the back-of-a-spoon method and I'm very happy with it. That said, it does kind of remind me of old-school VWs: pretty basic, a little funky and clunky.

Apparently he demonstrated it at Tamarind in the 90's and its been taught to most advanced litho students at UNM since. We even figured out a way to use the technique for serigraphy and etching.  The copper sulfate bath was what really changed printing for me. I'm currently trying to figure out how I can set up a non-toxic etching shop at my home using that bath.

I've had quite a lot of success with this method at home. For smaller prints though, I just use a baren or large wooden spoon.  Also, consider the type of ink you're using. It looks like you may have used water-based inks for this print, which can dry quickly and get tacky before pulling the print. Building up thin layers of oil-based inks will achieve a smooth and uniform print. There are ink retarders that can be added to water-based inks, but I've had little luck in getting the same kind of results that I do with oil-based."

You will often hear woodcarvers say that they aren't carving, they are bringing something out of the wood that was already there. (A lot of sculptors say that as well) which is something that I most definitely agree with.   I start out with a base sketch, and then let the wood grain and its natural desire to help guide my gouges. I tend to work with reduction, so I have to always be vigilant with where/when to stop carving so my layers can both breath and blend into one another in a manner that makes sense visually. If I carve too much out because the wood is telling me that it wants to loose a large section, I have to slow down and remove the section bit by bit until the colors on the print work/look nice. Otherwise that block will be dictating how the print looks instead of my own decisions. This often leads to swirls, or splintering of lines/colors in the background/under-layers which are part of what give reduction prints their unique look. I love it."
printmaking,2s3usk,teaseller817,1 point,Mon Jan 12 05:47:57 2015 UTC,"I too work with wood, in the technique were you destroy the block with each colour you print. My printing approach is always about the layers and the puzzle of layering colours and the interaction of shapes. Were some shapes will be lost for a next phase even though I need it.  I can work from a finished sketch or I can ""talk with the wood"" directly and work as I go. But in printing I'm always thinking layers and reduction, from the get go and between each printing phase.  The shape fascinations I can explore with just paper. In paper it's a lot of sketching and rubbing things out and making changes. Or cutting shapes in paper. With paper it's seems it's never about the layers but only about combining the shapes. I like how it's not definitive, with paper. But I thrive on spontaneous lines and then paper is just not solid/serious enough. My paper things are therefor always studies, never end results."
printmaking,2s3usk,churchofsanta,0,Mon Jan 12 20:48:30 2015 UTC,"Printmaking is process driven, as in ""What processes do I have to use to achieve this result?"" For the most part I need to have the entire artwork completed and then I break it down into its component parts for printing... it's backwards.  Drawing or painting, on the other hand, is exploratory and experimental. You start with a blank canvas and ""discover"" a finished work; there's also plenty of room for error or plan changes.  I don't really prefer one approach over the other, sometimes it's nice to have a systematic plan to follow, sometimes I just want to play around. Actually it's nice to have both approaches available to me, some artists are so rigid in their system that they crumble when some aspect changes.  Good luck with printmaking! It can be very challenging as well as very rewarding."
printmaking,2s3usk,coyotestories,1 point,Mon Jan 12 02:15:04 2015 UTC,Printing can definitely be an exploratory and experimental medium in the same way as painting. Not being able to completely remove something doesn't negate that.

I'd personally like to see a realistic portrait and also how you would work your style into something non relief or intaglio. Maybe play with a mono print with watercolor crayons?

printmaking,2rn637,NixBesser,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:22:36 2015 UTC,"There's one issue that I currently have, I just lost the use of etching press (though I MIGHT have one I can use with some wheelin and dealin) as of right now I'm limited to a letter press so I don't think intaglios are coming within the near future. as for applying what I do to other mediums I think that's a really good idea, I'm pretty good at carving but my actual drawing ability needs work and this might be a good time to branch out and see if I can do anything besides carve. Recently ROA a street artist came thru my town and he has a graffiti style somewhat simular to how I carve, I might get some paint and see how that goes."

printmaking,2rn637,beatjunkeeee,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:11:44 2015 UTC,ohhhhh incorperating realistic  portraits.... seriously how do i not think of these things.
printmaking,2rn637,detroitvinyl,2,Thu Jan 8 00:00:39 2015 UTC,"These are awesome! Really enjoy seeing your progression/ experimenting with different processes like the multiblock prints, printing on shirts, blind embossing, etc. Do you have background in graphic design or illustration?  Its obvious that you feel very comfortable technically; it looks like you know very well how to manipulate your tools to get the exact value that you want by using line and hatching. One thing that I would suggest is to push your value shifts even further. For example, in your print ""Lenard"". My favorite section of that piece is the dude sitting on the bench, and how he really sinks into the shadows of the area around him. The shadows on the right side of his face as well as his back/butt are so dramatic! Pushing your shadows and highlights to the extreme would add a whole other dimension to your prints.  Something I'm personally working on that I think would really be exciting for you to explore too... Your work is very graphic, in-your-face, relies heavily on a single image. Not that there's anything wrong with that at all! However it doesn't leave much room for viewer interpretation. Recently, I've been trying to abandon all of this and work more loosely; ""abstractly"", if you want to call it that. Meaning instead of trying to portray an image through your carving,try exploring different types of markmaking, textures, and movement through shape and form.   How I am trying to approach this is: instead of sitting down and doing a tight, illustrative drawing and trying to translate that into a linocut, maybe start with a loose and gestural 10 second charcoal thumbnail in order to figure out your composition and scale. Then just start carving! ""Go with the flow"", and let your piece develop itself. When I'm stuck in a rut with my artwork, I find it very refreshing to loosen up and just have fun with whatever I'm doing. Kind of abandon all previous knowledge of what is the ""correct"" way to do something and just having fun making art.  Also hand-coloring prints with watercolor or gouache is pretty rad. And zines/artist books are an awesome route to go if you want to experiment with ways to display your work. Printmaking and book arts lend themselves to each other very nicely.  Keep on keepin' on! Everyone gets in those funks sometimes. Its a terrible place to be but it won't last forever. Your work is great, can't wait to see where you go next. Hope this helps! :)"
printmaking,2rn637,Sackcloth,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:17:43 2015 UTC,"yah totally agree with pushing the contrasts. I always feel like if i leave some space black, it'll just seem to easy/flat, which actually ends up flattening out the image since it loses some one those bold contrasts, i'll try to get better at that.    that more gestural approach you were talking about reminds me slightly of a print i just saw of Tugboats, where they had a more painterly sky. http://www.tugboatprintshop.com/woodcut_valley.htm would be interesting to try to get some effects like that, or just do an entirely loose print just to see what happens.   Hand colorings.... don't know if i'd ever do it. Some people like it, some people do it sooooo well and it looks amazing. But personally speaking I feel like if i did it, it would be a bit of a cop out.... but then again, my preconceived notions are probably why i'm stuck in a rut.  Edit: also no background in illustration/graphic design, just printmaking. I try to use Ps/Ai occasionally but I never have any idea what I'm doing/ it takes me forever to accomplish the simplistic of tasks."
printmaking,2rn637,clueless_typographer,2,Thu Jan 8 00:35:17 2015 UTC,"You need to explore line more. All of your lines are conventional; try thick/thin, brush stroky, draw lines in other ways than what you're used too."
printmaking,2rn637,Existentialist,1 point,Thu Jan 8 01:37:07 2015 UTC,"Hey, its great to see your work, and I absolutely agree—it's so hard to get critiques outside of an institutional setting.  Other commenters have covered some of this: push yourself for more contrast, so bright brights and dark darks. Some of your pieces recede into monotone.   Your work is exceptionally catchy, but I too would like to see you develop and stick with a narrative or do a series that really digs in and explores a concept. Of course, not all art has to be high concept or narrative, but give it a try! Check some of these out for similarly character-driven work that also uses dark lighting like you do.   I'd also like to see you push scale—go really big—and materials. I think of things like Swoon's installations—that's not your style, maybe, but you are creating worlds/atmospheres in your prints, so what would happen if you went big?  For materials, I love the skateboards. Try more wood, maybe you could do something large-scale just with an inked woodcarving, no paper. What if you carved found objects? You depict a lot of old junk/boards/card/bottles/logs etc. so what if you carved those or used them more?"
printmaking,2rn637,Existentialist,1 point,Mon Jan 12 01:45:42 2015 UTC,"So i'll start with scale, I love big prints If i could i'd make nothing but massive 8 foot intricate prints, My biggest print topped out around 4'x5' and my biggest installation was about 5'x36'. unfortunatly, i'm currently supporting myself via printmaking, and its really hard to make massive prints (as well as installations (like swoon) unless you have some institutional backing) financially viable, trying to find someone who A) will buy a massive print B) pay enough to be able justify the time. I wish i could say fuck it, i'm gonna make nothing but massive prints, and if i make it someone will buy it, but realistically, it doesn't work out so well. BUT....I've been applying to grad schools, and if i get in, i'll definatly be going big again, but until then i'm probaby going to have to stick to around 18x24 or smaller.... lame i know, but i do need to pay bills.   Yah i agree about sticking with one thing for awhile, its just my problem is i get bored or think what i'm doing is getting boring/ visually to simular. I just really need to stick with one thing and exhaust it. Its kinda what i forced myself to do for one piece of my BFA show, I created a print every day for 180 consecutive days. At first it was fun, then after 2 months it sucked, and i told my teacher i hated it and wanted to stop, but she made me keep trucking and it turned out really well.

I can see that tension in your work. Sorry to suggest the unattainable. (that said, if you did a narrative series you could tile the 18x24 prints into a big thing)  I guess just be sure to always have a piece that you are excited by and is not about making money on the back burner, to work on when you have a moment.

Those kind of things always seem to help spark ideas. As far as your style is concerned, your work reminds me of Tom Huck and I do appreciate good hatching. Your prints are recognizable on this sub, and I think it is a very successful style for relief. For 2015 I would be interested in large scale and multi print projects. Is any of that helpful?"

printmaking,2regdo,ThyHolyPope,2,Mon Jan 5 23:25:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the kind words!  I have always been into more graphic work, so it definitely shows through my carvings.  I recently switched over to a black ink made by ""Drive by Press"", i think u/thyholypope also uses it?  Anyways you can find it through their site, but its just a really rich creamy oil based printmkaing ink with added drier.  I also add a drop or two of my own cobalt drier but i'm sure its overkill.  I print all of my designs on a flatbed etching press.  Two things i stress about printing on clothing/fabric is high pressure, and lots of ink.  It takes alot more power to get the ink to sit ""in"" the shirt and be a solid design.  I have a few shirts i like to test new designs on and to determine the right pressure.  Bear in mind though that when you switch back to paper you need to resume your professional printmaking training :-)  Use a nice fresh blanket for printing too, it's a bit weird at first to ""roll"" over the collar of the shirt.   I sometimes throw a piece of plexi over the whole thing (sort of like a tympan in litho) just be ensure even pressure throughout.    So yeah, more ink, more pressure, and high thread count!  Be careful though, too much pressure and you could warp your woodblock or ruin your linocut.  I recently printed some tote bags that had a low thread count, ended up printing with way too high of pressure and it embossed the block with the fabric, esentially destroying it from future use.  All in all, have fun with it.  When you order in bulk shirts tend to be as much as nice printmaking paper, so even though it may seem like more of a commodity if your ruin some it's not the end of the world.  It takes time to perfect your own process, but once you get going it's way too much fun."

printmaking,2r2htg,surely-delivered,2,Fri Jan 2 12:50:54 2015 UTC,my prof said the worst thing she ever did was try to sharpen one of her tools. maybe if you know of a professional sharpener take them in to them? or maybe try cleaning them with WD-40 and/or alcohol? WD-40 is made to break through rust and displace water (and the alcohol would degrease them afterward).
printmaking,2r2htg,ash_her,1 point,Fri Jan 2 10:25:47 2015 UTC,She doesn't sharpen them... ever? What about honing?
printmaking,2r2htg,ash_her,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:34:19 2015 UTC,I dunno! Hers are from Amsterdam and she tried sharpening one once and said it didn't carve well after that. I haven't needed to sharpen mine...
printmaking,2r2htg,BartMcCool,1 point,Fri Jan 2 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"I've found that if you hone your tools on a regular basis you shouldn't need to use a sharpening stone. The only time I've ever used a stone is when I've accidentally dropped a tool and chipped the blade. It still doesn't carve the way it used to and, honestly, after all the time I spent trying to fix it, I probably should've just replaced the tool."
printmaking,2r2htg,emalineisabear,1 point,Tue Jan 13 01:38:09 2015 UTC,"You know, I hate sharpening my tools. I think I just am not doing it right, plus mine are pretty cheap, so maybe not sharpening them is better. I have found that the tools I use the most frequently are still pretty sharp, so maybe that has something to do with it.  That said, for rust, I agree with /u/surely-delivered. Steelwool them, and then olive oil(or baby oil, it's what we use at my studio)."

printmaking,2qtzb6,radison,8,Tue Dec 30 17:48:10 2014 UTC,"My wife and I run a letterpress shop and one of our income streams is making and selling prints. We sleeve them in bags from www.clearbags.com with a piece of chipboard for stability (from uline, usually). It comes out to a few cents per print if you're doing enough, and that cost is easy to recoup as a professionally packaged and presented product sells much more quickly."
printmaking,2qtzb6,the_pressman,3,Tue Dec 30 19:24:50 2014 UTC,I'd be interested to know this aswell. My guess would be between acid free paper in a dry place away from the light. Not having them exposed to extremely hot or cold temperatures would help too i guess?
printmaking,2qtzb6,vreemde_eend,1 point,Tue Dec 30 18:17:51 2014 UTC,(Which type of acid-free paper would you advise to get ?). Answered below: glassine
printmaking,2qtzb6,vreemde_eend,3,Wed Dec 31 16:36:54 2014 UTC,"I own three portfolios - the cheap plasticy ones, I just stick everything in them.   I think my record is roughly 100 prints in one portfolio."
printmaking,2qtzb6,CSLC,3,Tue Dec 30 19:32:14 2014 UTC,"My old printmaking instructor told us to store them flat with sheets of glassine in between the prints. Glassine is a little pricey though, if you have a lot of prints. I just use newsprint for everything."
printmaking,2qtzb6,detroitvinyl,2,Wed Dec 31 01:23:02 2014 UTC,Lots and lots of newsprint
printmaking,2qtzb6,beachsunflower,6,Tue Dec 30 18:34:09 2014 UTC,"Newsprint is kind of acidic, you should use glascine. At least that's what my professors say."
printmaking,2qtzb6,Atmospherecist,1 point,Tue Dec 30 22:02:24 2014 UTC,Ooh didn't know that. I figured newsprint would be pretty non acidic. Guess not
printmaking,2qtzb6,beachsunflower,3,Wed Dec 31 00:13:36 2014 UTC,"Newsprint is highly acidic and will ruin your work if you leave it between them.  Just leave a sheet out in the sun for half an hour and you will see it discolor.  That is what it's doing to your prints only more slowly.  There's nothing but nitrocellulose fiber in newsprint: nothing to it.  I use it too, but only for drying or short term transport.  Glassine is the way to go if you care about the work and need to interleave them; if you buy rolls of it's then it isn't too expensive.  As for storage: I often get acid free foam board and use some tape to hinge it into a rigid folder.  It's cheaper than buying portfolios from the store and you could make a folder for each edition, etc. to help with organization."
printmaking,2qtzb6,Dugx0r,1 point,Wed Dec 31 15:08:06 2014 UTC,Oh thanks for the info! So helpful. The foam core portfolio sounds like such a good idea.
printmaking,2qtzb6,beachsunflower,1 point,Wed Dec 31 15:10:49 2014 UTC,Agreed
printmaking,2qtzb6,GnomeRobot,2,Wed Dec 31 06:59:27 2014 UTC,"Ideally, (like, in a perfect world where I have everything organized,) i keep them laying flat between sheets of interleaving paper. My prints are varying sizes, so I bought a bunch of large sheets off amazon (they may even have been the size people use to store quilts/large textiles) so i can cut them to size as needed. There are some prints that I take out of storage more frequently, so I bought packs of two different sizes of clear acetate sheets, taped them together on two or three sides to make folders, and keep one print in each. They stay flat that way, can't bend when shifted around, and are easier to handle without disrupting the pile or not putting them back correctly.  Instead of buying expensive acid-free storage containers from art stores, i get a catalog that specializes in archival materials. I'm on my phone so i don't know the name off the top of my head, but i can look it up if anyone is interested. I've purchased clamshell boxes there, but they have an unbelievable variety of storage and display options for all kinds of artwork. You can buy acetate folders/sleeves too, i just made my own to save money. As long as you tape them neatly, with acid-free tape, they look nice, and I've even sold them that way. And again, you'll have more freedom to accommodate different sizes."

printmaking,2qtzb6,sickofyoshit,1 point,Tue Dec 30 19:08:32 2014 UTC,I flatten my work out and then put it into the flat file. Check out Craigslist for a great deal on a flat file. They pop up every once in a while and usually for a decent price. Definitely worth the price.

printmaking,2qrdwr,Made_you_read_penis,6,Mon Dec 29 23:42:41 2014 UTC,"From the tone of your post, it almost seems to me like you're trying to talk yourself out of getting into printing. From your description, you could be on your way to making prints with way less than $100 investment on your part -- the hardware and lumber for a hinge board, some tape, gloves, and apron, maybe some screen filler and cheap ink to play around with, and you'd be on your way.    I think it's a real shame that you feel unable to take a class, since it would go a long way toward showing you just how easy this is, and making your comfortable with the process. It's a hell of a lot less scary than you're imagining. In lieu of classes, maybe you could find a weekend workshop in your area? Start checking around your local arts organizations for offerings. Also, Youtube is your best friend. If you can't get real-world instruction, a few quick searches on Youtube will yield you a wealth of instruction on screen printing. For example, about half a minute of searching yielded me a nice instructional video on how to make a simple hinge board. Start there, click on sidebar videos and keep watching, learn what you can, talk yourself into doing this, get inspired, and have fun with your new print facility!"
printmaking,2qrdwr,justjokingnotreally,2,Tue Dec 30 02:32:52 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  I watched quite a few YouTube videos.  It feels like they're all an overview, and each section isn't broken down that much.  There was a two hour one I really liked.  The local learning annex doesn't do printing.  The only thing I've really found has been at the junior college, but I can't commit that I could make that work for me.  We are a one car household, and it doesn't work out easily.  Saying that it's just a few hundred makes me feel relieved.  As for sounding hesitant on my end... Honestly this was just so unplanned.  I'm on the autism spectrum.  Only my family and wife know, and I'm pretty high functioning.  Surprises can just be hard for me, and this is something I want so bad I'm nervous I'm going to screw up.  I try to write in a way that just doesn't come off as douchtastic.  I feel overwhelmed, like I'm going to wreck the whole thing.  I like to know everything on a complete and minute level before I start something, and money is always a stress for me.  I've watched YouTube, but I feel like actual communication, like in a class really would help, like you advised."

If you make a mistake, and you will for the simple reason that you've never done this before, embrace the chaos and learn from it. That's all you can do. Good luck! And make sure to post your prints here so we can follow your progress :)"
printmaking,2qrdwr,dudebauer,3,Tue Dec 30 04:21:49 2014 UTC,"Silk screening is literally the easiest of the print media and you can absolutely learn enough in an afternoon to make your first print. If you need I can find some book recommendations for you, and you should definitely poke around YouTube and watch some videos to familiarize yourself with the process. Not sure where you're located but many small and most major cities have printmaking studios that you can take classes or do workshops at. I'm based in Atlanta and we have a fantastic organization here called the Atlanta printmakers studio where you can rent space or take classes in a variety of different print processes. You should absolutist check to see if there are any similar organizations around you. And if you ever wanted to send some if those screens my way I would be more than willing to pay a fair price :)"

printmaking,2qrdwr,the_pressman,2,Tue Dec 30 06:30:38 2014 UTC,The best advice is to just get out and experiment. You'll screw up at first - that's part of the learning curve. Don't expect to start printing as a full-fledged printer. Expect to start as a clueless newbie who doesn't know what they're doing. Going in with that attitude makes it MUCH easier to learn.

Got most of the supplies at my local Utrecht store. Ordered a few things online and now Im even printing T-Shirts too. It's cheaper to order supplies in bulk (acrylic inks, screen fillers, emulsions, etc.) but you don't need all the best equipment to just get started.   As for classes, check with your local community college or art school and see if they offer any night classes for adults. I take those too and although I work 40 hours a week and have a hectic schedule I find the time for print classes! Hopefully you can get into it and enjoy it as I have.

Business has been ramping up, but I definitely haven't figured out how to make a living yet -- luckily, my husband has a real job. However, start up costs were fairly low -- I spent about $4000 on materials, nearly $3000 of which was the press itself (a really nice table top etching press). I'm profitable, but barely.   I've been selling primarily through etsy right now, which allows me to sell all over the US (and the world). Although I'd like to do a lot of custom work, it helps to have plenty of ready-to-sell stuff available to drive traffic.   In the future, I'm hoping to get a bigger space and possibly host workshops. I'm also planning on doing craft shows next year."

I've really only sold locally at a few print sales. It's pretty inspiring that you're making it work!  Do you mind me asking what kind of press you bought?"

Super nice & smooth, good quality. If you look into it, I would definitely recommend getting the micrometer gauges. Tom Conrad builds them to order, and they do take several months to get.

It's a huuuuuuge press, and I'm sure it probably cost as much as a new car. I really like the look of the size you got. I may start out with the DickBlick econo etch just because of the price and little footprint, I'm not sure. I've been chatting with some other artists about it, and they seems divided about the quality. About half think it's great and has a great capability of micro adjustments, and the other half don't like it at all. In terms of print capabilities, you can't have paper that's wider than 9.5 inches. I'm planning on testing one out first before committing!"

printmaking,2oc65g,tessito,2,Fri Dec 5 05:18:48 2014 UTC,"It's kinda like xerox meets silkscreen... You get a layered semi-opaque look similar to silkscreen prints but the finished product differs in that the ink doesn't sit on top of the paper (it's closer to a newsprint / xerox look). It essentially creates a stencil that allows it to print multiples of one color very quickly.   The real draw is that they're intended to be more efficient at the medium range between a photocopier and full-on commercial printing so they're great for smallish DIY publishers who don't mind a little grime and extra effort. Because of this, they're big in the underground / alt comics scene right now. To give you an idea of what you can do with a Riso, here are a couple artists using Risograph machines to produce their books:  Lauren Albert  Mickey Z  Michael Deforge  The cons are that they're basically becoming outdated tech at this point so the materials and parts can be expensive, and they're messy to setup and run. Most folks I know of that are using them share the load with a group, either as the DIY publishing houses mentioned above or within an academic institution.  EDIT: To be clear, talking about Risograph, not Gocco (forgot they're owned by RISO)"
printmaking,2oc65g,chrkchrkchrk,1 point,Fri Dec 5 19:48:52 2014 UTC,"I worked for a commercial print shop that had one stuffed into a corner about 6 years ago and offered to sell me one. I spent some time getting it up and running and made a few prints. Ultimately I decided it wasnt worth all the fuss for prints with lots of (~8 or more) colors nor for working by hand/from the print.   If I spent a lot more time working with it I might feel different but I basically decided it didnt have any aesthetic that I couldnt achieve through another process. It does have a unique look when compared to other non handmade printing methods.  Our inks had a nice kinda chalky matte, and if you wanted to do direct digital design to paper prints that looked more handmade than offset or c-prints, or very very large editions I could see it having some potential but personally I think you'd still be better off using an automatic screen press. I like to work by hand though, so i'm definitely biased.  It is essentially a single color (at a time) copy machine and if you werent using digitally separated films the process for making a master page for each color was clunky and does not lend itself to working from the print to make the next color (which is normally the best way to work) due to scanning required for each master page. You are also somewhat limited in terms of paperstock due to the nature of the print.  The machines, like most printing gear are pricey and I remember looking up inks and films and figuring out that they were pretty high as well but that may have changed. Anyhow, that's my limited experience with them.  That said, I'm all for any and all kind of art/printmaking so if you can find one around DEFINITELY try it for yourself.  TL:DR -   * Cool looking but nothing truly unique about the look.   * Good for digital design prints with 1-3ish colors.  * Bad for working from the print or lots of colors.   * Just pay a shop to print some risographs for you its too expensive to buy into if you're not a commercial shop."
printmaking,2oc65g,print_maker,1 point,Fri Dec 5 06:34:00 2014 UTC,"I used Riso Gocco for a print making course this semester, and had a ridiculously good experience. Apparently my mom had picked one up at a garage sale in our neighborhood for 10 dollars (retail was $350) that was unopened and untouched. In fact, all of the oil based ink was still usable. I was really happy with the ease of use. I used it to screen print a personal logo I had designed in photoshop onto each of my works. It's a good way to go if you are looking to repeatedly replicate your print and you aren't looking to buy commercial equipment."
printmaking,2o75oc,dizzymizzy,3,Wed Dec 3 22:25:18 2014 UTC,Great job for a first aquatint. Be careful with your wiping and pressure though. That texture you're getting in the clouds should probably be just a flat value without any sort of texture and is normally caused by over wiping or using too much pressure. Check to make sure there's no embossment on the back and try paper wiping the plate and see what the results looks like. It's a great image though and I would be interested to see how things progress. Good Luck!
printmaking,2o75oc,dudebauer,2,Wed Dec 3 23:25:55 2014 UTC,"So, I revised it. I did around 5 aquatint layers here.

printmaking,2o75oc,Xyanthra,2,Thu Dec 4 04:48:29 2014 UTC,"Hey! I remember commenting on the first version you posted. This version is already a lot more visually interesting with the aquatints you added. Great job for a first go at everything, for real :) The clouds may look a little wonky, but you're on the right path. Pretty much every printer has to do a few plates that are mostly for learning techniques and figuring out what they like and don't like.   As far as this current print goes, my next suggestion to push it to the next level would be to add value to the structure. The side of it should be more shaded than the rest of it. A simple, fast way to do it would be one aquatint on the whole side of it. Other than that, I would just start working on something new and putting this one aside for the time being. I don't personally like to work on a single plate until it's perfect, and I know that most artists work on multiple plates at once for efficiency, since printing has a lot of down time with drying and such."
printmaking,2o7hth,jking94,4,Thu Dec 4 00:11:53 2014 UTC,"I knew a guy who pulled a number of prints off of skateboard decks.  He printed them by hand, rolling ink on with a brayer, laying the paper down on the deck and rubbing the back of the paper with the back of a large smooth wooden spoon.  A good Japanese paper would probably work very well since it will nicely conform to the shape of the deck- I recommend kitakata"
printmaking,2o7hth,TweeterMonkeyMan,2,Thu Dec 4 08:33:39 2014 UTC,Its probably going to be difficult because the bottom of the board is curved iirc. The best way to do it would be to ink up the board and kind of roll it onto the paper while pressing down as hard as you can on it. I would like to see the results though!
printmaking,2o7hth,lovetosaydada,1 point,Thu Dec 4 02:19:29 2014 UTC,"Ok, thanks for the advice! I will definitely be posting the results! Would you have any recommendations on paper? Were looking for something thick enough that it has some body to it. Basically I've been looking around, but all of the paper that I'm finding in large format seems to be thin like printer paper, which I feel like could be a problem."
printmaking,2o7hth,lovetosaydada,2,Thu Dec 4 03:54:54 2014 UTC,"Good all-around printmaking paper is Somerset satin. You should be able to find some at an art store or maybe a craft store. Even some double weight vellum could work. Look for paper around 22x30"" or bigger and just tear it down."
printmaking,2o7hth,suhbriba,2,Thu Dec 4 04:54:37 2014 UTC,"Exactly, the concave would make it difficult. normally you run the plate on paper through a press. You could ink up the board and press the paper to it and rub a spoon on the paper against the board to transfer the ink."
printmaking,2o7hth,BartMcCool,1 point,Thu Dec 4 02:35:23 2014 UTC,"I would reach out to the guys at Drive By Press. They've been printing with carved skateboard decks for a little while now. The concave/convex shape of the board is certainly problematic, but they figured out how to make it work."

printmaking,2o3nyj,Pajamanaught,2,Wed Dec 3 04:18:36 2014 UTC,Yah! A lot of my pieces are sort of love stories to the stages of intaglio. I have some photos of stages of prints if you are interested. First I do an initial etch of strong outlining lines. Then I add crosshatching for texture and depth. This one doesn't have it but sometimes I add cheese cloth texture for a medium shade. Then various stages of aquatint. Sometimes I add some burnishing if aquatint too dark and then finish with some drypoint to pop contrast. Thanks for the interest :)
printmaking,2o3nyj,dizzymizzy,1 point,Wed Dec 3 04:31:13 2014 UTC,"Love the line quality and composition. Definitely have a wonderful range of tonalities so good work there.   Just one critique really: USE A RULER! The lines are a bit distracting when they aren't exact; my eye immediately sees the whole picture first (lines included), but then darts around to all the little inconsistencies in the line work.  The hatching is wonderful but the effect is diminished by the inconsistency in your parallel lines. The print is great as is, but having the lines be more parallel would really improve the clarity of the print. So if you're going to do hatching/parallel lines.... use a ruler!"

It might be interesting to see a dark color there other than black, just to mimic the softness of a setting/rising sun... black, at least in this image, seems more nighttime, to me. I'd say something like a dark gray-blue would be beautiful. Or a dark red/brown if you want a warmer image... just some random ideas.  It looks like you need some practice inking!! Printing is definitely a skill that requires patience, but you'll get it quickly enough, especially if you're using expensive paper ;) When you spend 8 dollars per sheet you tend to be more careful, at least that's how it works for me..."

printmaking,2nd6rh,Sir_Meowsalot,2,Tue Nov 25 19:04:16 2014 UTC,Honestly? Quite low. At least where I am. Most lithographers will go on to an MFA program and become a professor. Not me. I'm a retail slave. :(

printmaking,2nd6rh,industrial51,2,Wed Nov 26 20:19:48 2014 UTC,"This is something Ive been thinking about since I started litho over a year ago. Besides being a professor, you can also train to be a master printer.  Master printers are commissioned by other artists to assist/print the artists image.  Although it may not sound as appealing to make works for others, master printers have access to a space in which they can create their own works too.  Check out Tamarind Institute. You could be a technician in an independent print shop or at a university... I think its important to consider relocating to a place you might not other wise be interested in.  Do some residencies to gain extra experience and you may find an opportunity that suits you artistically and financially.  I'm assuming you are a university student? If you want to continue after school, be sure to apply to residencies or artist run centers (internationally maybe - especially in Latin America where your dollar may go further).  Some independent shops offer studio access to members who pay a small fee and work around the shop for a few hours a week.  I hope this helps.  This is what I have been considering as a next step for myself too.  I think we should start a new thread in this sub to see what others know/think."
printmaking,2nd6rh,msrubydyer,1 point,Sun Nov 30 03:50:05 2014 UTC,"I'm indeed a Uni student, however, my interests and specialties have nothing really to do with printing nor lithography - though I am in the media realm of communications and imagery...I bounce between video and photography media.  I'm interested in printmaking due to the idea of making imagery from handcrafted blocks, stones, and other materials for posters and pictures.  I also had to ask about the job prospects because I have found that in my limited access to lithographers that their small numbers may indicate that it's very hard to find constant work or commissions. Though I am generalizing this from my own limited access to this realm.  But, your information is really quite interesting to me and I'm sure to others here! I think it would also be a cool idea as you mention to create a thread to find out about that step you mention. And possibly give your own experiences in the realm of lithography and printing."
printmaking,2nd6rh,Sir_Meowsalot,2,Sun Nov 30 03:56:53 2014 UTC,"Yea litho, especially stone litho (check out photo plate and ball grain litho - so cool and more accessible) is becoming an archaic art form. But its so flexible and a stone is the best kind of drawing surface!  Yea I'll start up a thread tmrw. I'm a print major, so I have a lot to share, but I'm limited for time haha. I also run a print club at my university - I will probably mention that/what Print Club does in the thread so other students might get ideas of how to spread the word about printmaking."

Heyo,  This is Todd Herzberg, aka ThyHolyPope, and i’d like to thank you for your interest in the First Annual /r/printmaking Holiday Card Exchange. So this is a pretty informal thing, but here are the specifics:  -Make 10 cards (this is a printmaker exchange so i’d ask that they be hand printed cards) that fit into a traditionally sized greeting card envelope ( you can get creative if you’d like but they not to go super crazy)  -Package them up and get them ready for shipping, within the package you should include:     -10 cards      -10 envelopes      -self addressed return envelope     -5 dollars (either a 5 dollar bill or a check (preferred) I can send an invoice via email (more work thus less preferred)  -Send them to the address below NO LATER (yes you can ship them before that, and it would be golden if you did) than Friday December 5th (yes this is a hard deadline). If your package is shipped after this date, then i can’t guarantee your participation in the exchange.   <if you still need my address Email me at toddherzberg@gmail.com>   -Once they get to me, I will document them, collate them, package them, and ship them out     -We currently have 10 people signed up. this is what will happen if the numbers change         -less than 10 people send cards: you will get the entire edition, plus how ever many of your extra cards are left over         -more than 10 people send card: you will get 10 cards that aren’t your own. you won’t get ever card but you’ll still get as many as you sent (this is probably obvious but if there are 12 people that send cards in you’ll still only get 10)   I’ll ship them out NO LATER than December 19 but i’ll shoot to ship them out by the 12th.    thats the gist of it. If you have any questions let me know. have fun with it. and happy holidays  Sincerely,  Todd Herzberg www.ToddHerzberg.com  Ps. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t post any photos of the cards your making on reddit. I was planning on releasing an album of all the cards a week after i shipped them ( i figure this will give everyone enough time to get their packages so not to ruin the surprise) if anyone really cares about karma, i can send you the album to post but i figured it would be cool to have them all shown at the same time"

printmaking,2n273c,TweeterMonkeyMan,3,Sat Nov 22 08:16:16 2014 UTC,"not quite? AP stands for artist's proof or print. it's a print (or couple of prints) made for the artist to approve/keep, usually when someone else is printing the image. There are also PP--printer's proof. these are done on the same paper, the same size so the artist and printer can see how the image will look for the edition.  I was taught that you do your edition and then, in theory, you would destroy the plate. Basically create the plate, proof it, print/edition it, done. There shouldn't be a section edition (according to my prof.). But I guess if you did, you could include it in the title? ""My Print, Edition 2"" then number it as usual (ap, pp, 1/#, 2/#, etc.)"
printmaking,2n273c,erinalexa,3,Sat Nov 22 18:40:17 2014 UTC,"Usually if the paper is significantly different in color/texture, then it is counted as a separate edition.  In your example they would be three different editions since the papers change the experience enough that they would effectively be different images.  As ash_her and erinalexa described, one way this is indicated is through the signing when someone will include ed. 2, ed. 3 ...etc.  This is more or less how it is handled at the Tamarind institute and you can never go wrong following their lead.  I've known artists who will have an initial edition and then do a followup with some subtle change (like paper color) and will number that edition with roman numerals (I/X, II/X, III/X...etc).  If you print an image on several different papers and eventually choose a paper for the whole edition, these initial images are usually trial proofs (signed t/p) indicating that they are a proof pulled when trying out different materials."

IMO your buying into the professor more than anything so make sure you like them, have a program that looks like a good fit? Email them and see if you can arrange a meeting/ talk about their program. Your gonna be stuck with them for 3 years so make sure it feels like a good fit before you commit."

printmaking,2my4ww,DirtyLithography,1 point,Fri Nov 21 14:26:35 2014 UTC,"Yah fuck that 100k+ noise, I'm applying to schools at the moment, and the only schools I'll apply to are schools that have full- mostly full tuition assistance. Which brings up a good point, ask about their tuition assistance. A lot of schools will offer quite substantial  funding to grads. Thru being a TAs, shop techs, etc they'll often help cover your cost of tuition and straight cash thru stipends. The smaller the school the more likely they can help you financially. a program with 100 grads will have funding but will be much more competitive, where as a program with 12 will be better suited to help everyone out.   I just feel like coming out of school with strapped with 100k in loans in the art field (ie your not stepping into a high paying field) is something you have to consider while planning your future."

printmaking,2mugml,Pajamanaught,3,Thu Nov 20 13:39:59 2014 UTC,"This is a nice print. Your detail and line quality are excellent and your composition works well with the subject matter you chose. My only critique would be the apparent lack of any range of value in the prints. This makes the print look flat despite your use of perspective. In my opinion, darkening some of the shadowed areas considerably would help increase the contrast of value in the print and therefore make the image stand out more. I don't know if this helps or not but another suggestion could be darkening the background to black to bring forward the foreground? Just a thought.   Overall this piece works well but could use a little more tinkering. Excellent job for your first etching!"
printmaking,2mugml,Xyanthra,2,Thu Nov 20 14:47:11 2014 UTC,Thanks for the advice. I'm learning aquatint in a few weeks. I've planned on darkening the side and adding some clouds somehow. Hopefully that'll  help.
printmaking,2mugml,Pajamanaught,3,Thu Nov 20 20:49:19 2014 UTC,"Aquatint would be perfect on this piece. I recommend not etching lines out for the clouds, or making them fluffy or detailed or anything; I'd just use the edges of the aquatint to define them. The structure could use aquatint on it too, on the shaded parts if you're feeling adventurous. You might have to do a couple layers of aquatint to get a range of values, though. It would be quite daunting for someone just getting started with etching... but it's all about experimenting, right? ;)  Also, just a minor technical thing--I think you might have wiped away too much ink in this print. Some of the lines have that faded look that comes from overzealous wiping; if you are more gentle with removing the ink your lines will be much stronger. Pretty much everyone's first few etchings are like that, that's just how it is for a beginner learning the ropes."

printmaking,2lnfup,elephantsmiles,8,Sat Nov 8 05:50:30 2014 UTC,"Certainly! These are all screen prints, as it's a passion of mine. A couple of years ago I was doing a print for a shirt for my son and needed some scrap paper to test print on. I didn't have anything the right size, so I stole a couple of pages out a nearby book and laid them down on the platen. I liked the ensuing print so much that I've kind of made it my niche ever since.  I hit up used bookstores in my area (mid-Missouri) and generally look for a book that will give me a roughly 6""x9"" page, since that usually nets me a 5""x7"" block of text to print over. Print ideas come from all over. I'm constantly doodling in a little pocket notebook I have, so I pull ideas from there a lot. My three year old son also helps when he can (""The deer should have a party hat. He and the bird are going to a party tonight.""). The figures come from a love of old school pin ups and a newer fascination with vintage silhouette pieces. My wife's family is big into antiquing and it's something you see occasionally that I think is really neat, so I've started incorporating it into my work with a slightly more modern style.  These will all be fairly small editions when they're done (probably in the neighborhood of 20 prints or so), hand pulled with 2 (or in one case 3) colors. Since I'm doing such small runs I use vinyl for the stencil instead of emulsion. I work at a sign shop and use the vinyl plotter there to run off my stencils, then I weed them and apply them to the screen backs. I print with latex house paints thinned out with Floetrol. It stays wet in the screen long enough, but dries really quickly on the page, so that's nice. Any other questions?"

I like it for improvised carving, but it can make a really beautiful print if you plan your layers right. It's also cheaper to use one block for several layers than a block for each layer. Make sure you print enough of each layer before carving so you have material to work/experiment with.  The times I've used linoleum I preferred harder linoleum mounted on a block. Now I only use wood for relief printing, if you're into trying it I suggest shina plywood from McClain's.

I've been taking photos of the process because many people have trouble visualizing how it works. I'll post them up when I finish (1-2 weeks from now). Basically, you print your colors from lightest to darkest because the darker colors can easily cover the lighter ones.   I don't think that many people do reduction cuts in linoleum because it stretches slightly and won't give good registration, but I could be misinformed.  I've been using MDF for woodcuts (medium density fiberboard). It's often cheaper than linoleum and carves easily. The linoleum I've used is gray and soft and comes in a large roll. I've never seen a brand name because I've never purchased it for myself.   As for mixing colors, you should get a color wheel. I almost never print in purely opaque colors. I usually add a significant amount of transparent base to my colors. If you wanted light blue, rather than adding white and blue together, you add transparent base and blue. The white of the paper will make it appear light in color. I think it looks nicer that way and it dries faster."

printmaking,2l8m4x,kogbob,1 point,Tue Nov 4 14:25:13 2014 UTC,Looks cool. That seems like a pretty small plate which tend to be more tricky to hold on to while carving. If you find you need better control or if the plate is sliding out from under your gouges I'd recommend a table hook like this http://www.dickblick.com/products/martin-universal-design-carving-block-holder/ . Not suggesting that you actually buy one though. It is a super simple design that can be made with 4 screws and 1 dollar worth of scrap wood.

printmaking,2l1dys,Ickarus_,1 point,Sun Nov 2 06:02:48 2014 UTC,"Both, actually! It's hard for me to fully explain the process, but it can essentially be described as ""chemical printmaking."" Lithography capitalizes on the fact that oil-based ink and water do not mix, and making the drawn areas of a plate ""oil-loving"" and the negative spaces between those drawn areas ""water-loving."" With litho, you can also do photo transfers, though in the case of this image, the image transfer is very faint and fairly unreliable, so I did need to go back in and draw/paint over many areas to try to make the image a bit more cohesive!"
printmaking,2l1dys,ThyHolyPope,1 point,Sun Nov 2 14:27:17 2014 UTC,"So basically, correct me if I'm wrong, the entire image is a photo transfer (the light grey is the result if the transfer) and he drew over it the transfer to make things more pronounced (the dark blacks)."

printmaking,2kln87,aruzakbe,3,Wed Oct 29 23:53:59 2014 UTC,"Honestly work and shipping won't be a big deal. Collating an edition of 10 cards is super easy. and if anyone really can't afford the 5 dollars for return shipping PM me and we can work it out and why i i think having a shipping hub is a good idea:  -people on the internet often like to say they're going to do something but never actaully do. So if we just send out 10 adresses to 10 people, you MIGHT get 10 cards back, or you MIGHT get 2, even though you sent your 10 out to all 10 people. With me sending out the complete packages, you get what you expect, If you send cards in you WILL get cards back no ifs ands or buts.  ex: my friend starting this pen pal thing, 5 people said they would be pen pals with her, she wrote to all of them, I am the only one who wrote back, and i want to avoid that.   -Also people some people don't like giving out their address to random people on a internet forum, with only 1 person with access to their address, it may seem less threatening.   -but this is the first one, if it doesn't go well/ people want to change things for exchange #2 i'm perfectly fine with that."

printmaking,2km6gh,churchofsanta,2,Thu Nov 6 18:12:16 2014 UTC,"I really don't want to discourage you from experimenting in printmaking but it is actually quite a lot of fuss. You have to make all of the same considerations that artists who paint and draw make BUT you can't paint- over/erase mistakes AND you have to do it backwards.... you are also chained to a process that has its own unique set of techniques and problems to potentially troubleshoot.   There is just way too much information to give you in a subreddit comment.  That being said, I think it's a fine idea to explore and experiment with printmaking. I would start with unmounted linoleum (from Blick) a speedball linoleum cutter (Blick), brayer (any cheap one from Blick), box- cutter, big metal ruler, ink (Blick sells a relief ink that cleans up with soap and water), paper, glass surface, wooden spoon.  Use your box- cutter and ruler to score your linoleum (don't try to cut through) into smaller rectangles about the size of cigarette packs.   Experiment on the small pieces with your lino- cutter a lot. Try things you think will work AND things you think won't work, also figure out how each of the gouges work.  With your brayer, roll out a bead of ink onto your glass surface until the brayer is evenly coated, then roll up your linoleum experiments.  Place a piece of paper onto your inked up linoleum and use the back side of the wooden spoon to rub the paper firmly onto the linoleum.  Remove your print.  Now, any one of those steps can go wrong... too much ink, too little ink, too much pressure, too little, carved too much, too little, bad paper, bad rolling technique, etc. Just keep practicing and experimenting.  If you have a reoccurring problem that you just can't seem to fix, take a photo and post it here, someone will be able to figure it out.  I'd stay away from woodblock for now... it has it's own third set of things to worry about and it can be more expensive.  If you're Googling instructions or videos try search terms like ""relief printmaking, linoleum printmaking, reduction prints (for multi- color)  Good luck!"

printmaking,2km6gh,Daisybellemay,1 point,Tue Oct 28 23:53:19 2014 UTC,"I have taught printmaking workshops for kids and the absolute, most dead simple way to get started is relief printmaking using styrofoam as a plate and a pencil to make marks. Use a brayer to roll on water-soluble printmaking ink and print on any paper handy (computer paper, construction paper). The only specialty items in that list are the ink and brayer (roller) which are inexpensive and easy to find in art supply stores or online. Now obviously this is not going to be incredibly elegant, but it is incredibly accessible and a great way for someone to have fun playing with the basic concepts.   I would buy sleeves of styrofoam disposable plates (like picnic plates) for my workshop kids--they 'd write on the bottom, we'd have round prints. Sometimes I save the styrofoam trays from buying packaged food and trim off the raised edges of the trays. Still fun for quick and dirty fooling around even though I have a lot more sophisticated toys now."

printmaking,2ivso3,modernalchemist,5,Fri Oct 10 19:25:29 2014 UTC,I prefer 3/4 Shina ply from McClain's printing supplies. It really is the nicest wood I've carved on. There was an issue a few years ago with small knots in some of the inner ply but they were still great.   I've also used hardwood grilling planks from the supermarket with some success.   Stay away from Home Depot plywood. It will dull your knives in no time at all and you won't get a nice print quality from it. You could get pine boards or any kind of wood really and they would be better than your standard hardware store plywood.
printmaking,2ivso3,Borgoff,1 point,Fri Oct 10 20:15:03 2014 UTC,http://www.imcclains.com/  Here's there website. I second the recommendation!

printmaking,2ivso3,og_elia,2,Fri Oct 10 20:59:32 2014 UTC,Birch plywood wood is easy to carve and holds a really nice line. It is middle of the road as far as price and it doesn't usually warp.

printmaking,2iq31o,PHXgp,5,Thu Oct 9 02:40:34 2014 UTC,"Dick Blick is fairly convenient when it comes to ordering printmaking supplies and they have a good selection.  They have some relief printing tutorials on their pages.  For just starting out you might try some of the easy cut/speedy cut materials just to get a feel.  They carve very easily but don't allow for as great of detail.  Battleship linoleum is harder, yielding better detail but making it more difficult to carve.  Water-based ink works pretty well for starting off- it cleans up easily and prints pretty nicely.  Oil-based ink allows for easier handling, nice printing detail, and will be permanent on fabric but is harder to clean up and requires veggie oil or baby oil for cleaning.  Supplies: Linoleum Carving Tool Brayer 4"" is a good starting size Ink Spoon piece of glass or plexi for rolling out ink paper    There are some great smaller and more specialized printmaking supply companies that have some really great and high-quality materials.  McClain's is a relief-printing specialty store and has some wonderful high-end tools and equipment.  Good luck!  Printmaking can be highly addictive and very rewarding."
printmaking,2iq31o,TweeterMonkeyMan,1 point,Thu Oct 9 03:06:12 2014 UTC,"Wow, thanks for the info! I saw dick blick had a lot of stuff but didn't know how to sort/judge what I need. I saw somewhere that the easy-cut linoleum was really easy to tear apart and I have a lot of patience so maybe I'll go right for the battleship?  Also, bonus question: if you had to buy one item (linoleum, carving tool, brayer, ink, or paper) at McClain's which would it be?"
printmaking,2iq31o,TweeterMonkeyMan,2,Thu Oct 9 03:32:19 2014 UTC,"If you're feeling game for it you can jump right in to the linoleum.  Warming it a little will help make it a bit easier to carve- you can place a towel over the surface and run a hot iron over it to heat up the block.  Be careful when carving not to carve toward your hand or body, at first you will have numerous slips and you don't want to stab yourself.  Trust me on this warning, most people end up stabbing their hand at least once on their first project because they are holding down the block with one hand and carving with the other.   Asking what one item i'd buy from McClain's is difficult.  They focus mainly on woodcut supplies, emphasizing traditional Japanese materials so they have an excellent selection of high-quality carving tools.  Since I already had a decent amount of printing supplies, the first item I purchased from them was a small v-gouge."
printmaking,2iq31o,TweeterMonkeyMan,1 point,Thu Oct 9 04:24:02 2014 UTC,"Awesome, thanks for the response! Only one more question: do you have any favorite linocut/woodblock artists that I could look up?"
printmaking,2iq31o,cookiecatgirl,2,Fri Oct 10 18:43:33 2014 UTC,"Glad to help, it's always exciting when a new person gets into printmaking. Here are a few artists you might like to look at:    For an early artist, Albrecht Durer is hard to beat (for western-style prints).    The Ukiyo-e style Japanese woodblocks are lovely, the most famous example of which is of course Hokusai's ""Mount Fuji Seen Below a Wave at Kanagawa""    More contemporary (20th century) one of my favorites is Leonard Baskin    There are a number of great relief print artists working at the moment. A few that come to mind:  Johanna Mueller and    Bill Fick who also has a great video of him producing a linocut from start to finish.    Tom Huck's ""Evil Prints"" are pretty gnarly (NSFW)."
printmaking,2iq31o,ThyHolyPope,2,Sat Oct 11 02:47:31 2014 UTC,"If speedycut/pink stuff has too much give, I find freezing it for short periods stiffens it a bit.   For softening lino blocks, check your local thrift stores for a 70s style electric warming tray!"
printmaking,2iq31o,BartMcCool,1 point,Thu Oct 9 05:37:22 2014 UTC,"Like others posted, start with a dick blick order. I'd grab  (1) battle ship grey linoleum: it's what I've used for about 5 years and I like it   (2) speedball lino cutter: it has 5 tips to it cost less than 10 bucks, there are better tools, but again, I've been using those for about 5 years and I like it.   (3) small cheap brayer: get whatever one/ size you want. If your starting small, just get something small. A small speedball brayer will do to just fine.   (4) biggest choice for you is ink: oil based vs water based. Oil is what I use, richer colors longer working time, thus longer dry time, but since it's oil harder to clean up. Water based I've never used, so I can't really comment in its quality  (5) if you are hand printing your going to want to use a thinner paper Japanese papers would probably be ideal, it's much harder to transfer the ink with hand pressure if your paper is to thick.   (6) your buren:  now you can go buy an official printmaking buren which isn't to expensive, or you can just use a spoon. What I'd recommend is going to a Asian market/ store and getting a bamboo rice spoon with a flat bottom, they're only like 1-2 dollars and the flat bottom make them much easier to work with than the rounded bottom of a spoon.   (7) shirts: so I don't know how successful handrubbed shirts will be, but my advise: Get an can of Gamblin's Drive By Black. Google ""drive by black"" and watch them print a shirt, there are slight variations that come with shirt printing, and they go over most of them."

The first round of shirts I made faded real bad, looked into it a bit, and I was printing them the same as is they were paper, so I had to modify how I was inking. Second round I used straight gamblin ink, it faded a little bit, but not really much. I've washed it about 5 times now, and it seems like it's good. Round 3, switched to Gamblin's drive by black, let em dry. Washed em, and they didn't really fade at all. Maybe very minimally, but they seem to be holding up really well. I've been washing them cold (that's what the actual shirts call for).

printmaking,2h5dhp,olydemon,2,Mon Sep 22 23:50:30 2014 UTC,"Next time around try this:  print your image out on a Laser printer, or use a copy machine. This method flips your image so no need to reverse. Inkjets wont work, and possibly not all Laser printer/copiers from what I read. I had good luck with my works printer.   Get a jar of Liquitex Gloss Gel Medium  http://i.walmartimages.com/i/p/00/09/43/76/92/0009437692418_500X500.jpg  Paint it in an even coat on your Lino material.  place image face down on wet out block. (again, this process flips the image so no need to reverse before printing.)  evenly press out the excess medium between the paper and Lino. the goal is to glue the paper down with a super thin layer of the gel. the rest gets rolled out. I've used rollers, and squeegees and both worked fine. The paper does get sort of wet so working time is limited... dont work it too hard or it will tear if using a squeegee... I ended up finding a wide rolling pin worked best starting at one edge rolling all the way to the other in one motion..   once it is glued down and dry for a few hours (depends on how large and how much medium was left), run warm water over the paper. Lightly rub the paper with your fingers. It takes a little bit of time to get it all off, but keep at it.   Here is an image of mine where I had just about removed all the paper. http://photos-d.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xaf1/10632330_291207081084131_216821076_n.jpg  Here are some other examples of images I transferred: http://scontent-a-sea.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpa1/t51.2885-15/10540244_729200350472639_956736701_n.jpg  http://photos-a.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xpa1/925295_784661264898120_1235200832_n.jpg  once I got the hang of it the process is quite easy. there are some videos on youtube of people doing this transfer method onto wood but not for the purpose of printing, seems to be a cliche wedding thing... but the concept and process is the same. Good luck. Feel free to ask for clarification if needed."

printmaking,2h5dhp,rabid_rabbit_prints,1 point,Tue Sep 23 01:29:37 2014 UTC,"Acetone is actually a pretty bad choice for doing this kind of transfer.  The reason it gets chosen is it's cheap and you can get it anywhere.  Unfortunately it doesn't have that great solvating power and its very hygroscopic, so it's going to be wet and that means it doesn't transfer paint well.  Something that's looks good and is recommended is Bestine Solvent, sold at art stores.  It's essentially hexanes which is the dryest, least nasty solvent you probably want to be handling during a print."

printmaking,2gi84r,beheartcore,3,Mon Sep 15 23:01:14 2014 UTC,"When I use speedy cut, I end up with a lot of lines that I don't want. Lino blocks or lino sheets will be able to provide a lot more detail.  Try setting the paper on the block and pressing firmly with the back of a spoon or with a baren. I usually lift up part of the paper and check underneath to see how the design is printing. That tells me where to add more pressure.  Qualities in paper? Well, it depends on what type of design you're making. A paper with lots of pulp is going to provide a different outcome than one that is relatively smooth. Experiment to see what you like with each print.  General suggestions are to keep messing around. You'll need to try a lot of designs, ink brands, and methods to find what you like.   (And what makes things click for me is an episode of Doctor Who. That was my printing background noise and my sanity throughout the wedding invitations I recently completed.)"
printmaking,2gi84r,Linguiste,2,Mon Sep 15 23:19:56 2014 UTC,"With the rubber speedy cut stuff, you can get away with using it kind of like a rubber stamp, putting it on top of the paper and pressing down like you have been. With real lino, if you're not using a press then you have to put the paper on top. Use a baren or a wooden spoon to press the paper down onto the inked carving in circular motions (wax on, wax off).  For hand-printing like this, thinner paper works better--try mulberry, kozo, kitakata, anything that feels sort of like tissue paper should be light enough. These papers are pliable enough to be printed without the pressure you would get from a press. They can then be mounted to mat board or to a thicker paper (like cotton rag) if you want.  As far as general tips: if you're going to get into printing, get some good tools, not the speedball multi-tip ones. I like Flexcut palm tools, they're awesome on wood or lino. Also, carbon paper. Carbon paper is amazing for transferring a finished drawing onto a block."

The water based is okay, but the oil based ink will give you a much better print.    Paper is irrelevant, though nice paper is indeed nice.  Sometimes I use plain computer paper as test sheets of to run a few prints off.  Please for the love of all that is printable, place the paper on top of your linoleum and use either a flat wooden spoon or a tool made especially for pressing prints (forgot the name it goes by, looks like a hockey puck with a handle on it)."

printmaking,2gi84r,pinky_andthe_brain,1 point,Tue Sep 16 22:34:02 2014 UTC,"As everyone has suggested, using good linoleum is ideal. It's not much more in price, and for getting higher quality prints it is worth it in the long run. I have been able to get extreme detail with high quality lino sheets at 18 x 24 Inches, no issues (besides getting proper ink transfer).  And to get proper ink transfer, definitely place the paper over the top of the linoleum you are using rather than placing the linoleum face down on paper. Someone mentioned hand pressing with paper, and you can do this... but only with certain paper weights. I would not recommend using like 280 gsm for hand press, as you will end up with a kind of vibration of ink from all of the pressing.   With hand pressing I would definitely recommend a lighter rice paper for sure. You wouldn't need a ton of ink for pressing, but that comes with test printing of course. Pick up some newsprint paper and test print with that.  For tools, it all depends on what you like. Test out a couple of different cutters (I honestly still use speedball and it works perfectly for me). If your thumb or whatever is getting numb from all of the cut work, get a leather thimble."

printmaking,2ftas3,spocknroll,3,Mon Sep 8 15:19:20 2014 UTC,"If you use waterbased ink (I use Charbonnel Aqua Wash ink) you just use water to paint into the inkplane. The more water you use the more your ink will be diluted/removed and the more your paper will show. For more effects with painting you can use an oil-based etching ink which you can dilute with linseed oil or turpentine. to paint into the inkplane you use cellulose thinner. You can use a cloth to wipe away ink or large area's of ink. You can use the backend of brushes to draw into the ink You can also just roll out a plane of ink, lay your paper on top and draw onto the paper. It's a technique which would be invented by Gaugin called ""direct trace drawing"".  Another good source to read about mono-type/-print is monoprints . com (printmaking -> monotype).    I don't know if you are being supplied by your school but you will also need a brayer to roll out a plane of ink. Advised is to get one of 20cm or more in length (depends ofcourse on how large you want to print).    You will also need a surface to roll the ink out on. You can use a plexiglass surface for waterbased ink but if you were to work with oilbased ink and cellulose thinner it's better to use something like a glass plate instead of a plexiplate since these products will bite into the plexi.    If you are going to handprint the monotypes kozopaper can be a good starting point. If you want to work on more sturdy paper you can use something like an Arches 88 paper.    You could also invest into a baren to help you with handpulling your prints. A spoon of which you rub the bowl onto the paper can work too. Be careful to not place your finger into the bowl but rather on the stem close to the bowl since the friction of the rubbing can cause to bowl to heat up.    Good luck :-)!"

Takach Press is now carrying KM Photopolymer Plates which, from what I've been told, work quite similarly although different in color and with a different base.  Graphic Chemical seems to be carrying new plates as well but is more vague about the details.  edit: a word"

I used a photography exposure unit, not sure of the brand there, but I've even seen people home-rig exposure units out of a projector with a bright bulb."
printmaking,2fq09s,cmykadabra,1 point,Sun Sep 7 16:54:47 2014 UTC,"You can get solar plates from various distributors on the web: I know Blick has them, nontoxiprint.com, and mcclains (personal favorite printmaking materials suppliers). Shop around! Solar plates are expensive and you will find a good deal if you spend the time looking.  When exposing you can use the sun! But don't keep it in direct sunlight or you'll have a double exposure. But otherwise, ANY UV exposure unit will work. Make sure you expose your plate to a halftone screen before your positive/negative.  As for ink, I have used both etching and relief inks in my experience. That is because you can treat your solar plate like either. Use stand oil mixed with linseed oil to make it easier to work or methylcellulose to dry it. I have even used oil paint with both the oils and the methylcellulose to make it easy to print with."

printmaking,2fjz17,artfart,2,Fri Sep 12 04:49:44 2014 UTC,"Birch plywood works well, and is pretty cheap, like 15 bucks for a 50inx50in piece. Tends to splinter a little bit, but its on the softer end of hardwoods. Maple and walnut are on the harder, side, and most fruit tree woods (cherry, apple) are considered some of the best detail retaining woods, however they come at a lofty price. I'd say if you're looking for small prints that have enough density to maintain precision like linoleum, then those more expensive woods would be best. But if you're doin large scale woodcuts, birch plywood, or poplar make the most sense to me. MDF has no grain and poses no naturalistic woodgrain qualities, but everyone's right, cuts like butter. sometimes so easily that ill cut through a large portion without much effort and it sort of peels off."

But you say this finish ends up being ""rougher compared to the smooth feel of paper,"" which is the opposite of what I'd expect. I'm not sure how exactly what I'm referring to is printed, but I'm sure the coating is applied in a similar manner as the ink.  Are we talking traditional printmaking techniques like silkscreen, relief, intaglio, etc. (i.e., what this sub is mostly related to), or are we talking something you buy from VistaPrint?"

printmaking,2fd4w3,Feather_fingers,1 point,Wed Oct 15 21:32:15 2014 UTC,"There are a number of ways to achieve this. A varnish would probably be the cheapest and easiest way. Gloss varnish to make it glossier, dull varnish to dull it. Gloss varnishes are very smooth when printed compared to dull. These types of varnishes are very VERY loose and are usually used on litho projects.  Coatings (especially UV) are a totally different animal. Depending on the pigments used, coatings may burn out your print. Coatings provide increased rub resistance and more gloss than varnishes can - but do very very very little to protect from fading. This is a common misconception.  Foil stamping and printing on paper that has been pre-silk screened with pearlescent pigment (where the ink is applied on top of the pearl) come to mind as other options."

It seems like it just awkwardly comes straight down, if this was my print, i would have the rope come out of the side of the birds beak, have a little bend in the rope when would make it seem more part of the image rather than just an un attached afterthought. Just my 2 cents. And good luck on this exam of yours.   Edit, just looked at this again, and said aloud, ""man that registration is on point."""
printmaking,2f9tle,HerbiGiraffe,2,Tue Sep 2 16:51:21 2014 UTC,"So I think the hardest part of doing all of it yourself would be getting things accurate/ precise. I mean you could probably carve a block, and carve out a a slightly larger negitive on another but it'd be impressive to get everything to line up. If you want to emboss prints you could just blind emboss your paper on a press ( thought it's not as fast as squeezing some tongs) Why not design your logo/ design yourself, carve it (or w/e you do), print it, scan it, take it into Ai or some other program live trace it and then have these fellows."

We launched an etching ink line about a year and a half ago. Initially we fumbled (new to etching ink and didn't really know what was needed). With the help of some local schools and artists we have fixed a lot of the initial problems (biggest issue was that they were way too loose). As confirmed by local schools - all of our etching inks are suitable for relief. All our inks (etching and litho) are vegetable oil based and made by hand in the US (in the same building I sit in). Our inks are available directly from us at hancoink.com, as well as our distributors Renaissance Graphic Arts and Takach Press. Graphic Chemical does not carry our etching inks but do carry our litho inks.

I think they're very helpful in the growth/ development as an artist, so heres my critique of these 4 pieces.   1 the boat is by far my favorite out of this collection, it has a very nice balance between antique and modern. although its an old ship that could have sailed at the time of the map the printing method makes it seem fresh. the rainbow roll is lovely, and texture overlay on the boat silhouette is a really nice touch. nice job.  2 has some nice textures, i expecially like the area with the brown fairly geometic circles overlapping the more organic forms, i feel like this could be pushed farther, right now, i feel like it feels slightly more hap-hazard, but thats just my opinion  3 Honestly, in every print class i've ever been in i've seen at least 1-5 samurai prints. again in my opinion they're very kitschy, unless something about them is done very differently/ modern-esque. unless you actually doing something reinventive/ semi original with them they'll get lost in the swarms of other samurai prints. that being said, its fairly well done.  4 although i see what you did, it seems like the 2 images are fairly unconnected visually. I think that although a 7 layer screen print is technically impressive it isn't entirely needed here. i think it would have served you better to maybe incorporate some of the colors from the bomb into the detenator. or overlap some on the imagery. right now it feel more like object A) bomb-- object B) detenator -- object C) backround instead of simply being one image. and although thematically they are make sense together, i think you need to work on visually tieing them together."

Once you've carved and printed the figure do you get a second sheet of lino and make the shape with a great big void where the figure is?  I saw you've been doing some t shirts lately too. Are they screenprints of your work or are you actually printing from the lino straight onto the fabric?"

So all I did was the figure, cut that outa the block, cut those yellow pieces off the original block, ink them up at the same time, then puzzle piece it back together on the press. It was a total pain doing this one it's 9 pieces, and just took forever to do because of that. If you have a reliable registration method it'd probably be faster/ easier to do with 2 layers, but I had to have this done by this weekend for an Big art fair I'm in so I did it this way, plus it saves linoleum :)   As for the shirts I'm using gamblin relief ink, I'm experimenting with some things but they're not 100% yet. Gamblin makes a fabric relief ink ""drive by black"" problem is I want to be able to print color too so that why I'm doing it on my own.

Both have a similar long handle and grip. I haven't tried the shorter palm grip ones yet so I can compare what is better. Overall these have been a big improvement over the speedball cutters.

One guy I know has printed a few books of some of his friends poetry, what he does is print the body text on a laser printer and then screen prints/letterpress/woodblock prints the cover.

So much easier for you (don't have to post 10 links) for us (we don't have to click link click back ten times)   As for the black background, my first thought (if you want to keep working on these) would be to simply print a layer either on top or under the black. Although its black, the ink will sit on another layer of ink differently than it will sit on the raw paper. so you could add a very subtle layer/ texture that way."

However, the great thing about the Line-O-Scribe is the adjustment dial on the roller.  Remember, you can always increase the gauge to accommodate the blankets, reduce your imprint strength, allow for galley-set print elements (above type-high), etc.  By the way, those old Line-o-Scribes work really well with type-high polymer plates - do you do platework at all, or just cuts?"

printmaking,2c8pg6,vertigo25,2,Thu Jul 31 18:49:37 2014 UTC,"Thanks!  Printing on fabric is much easier than you think, you just kind of have to disregard what you've learned for printing on paper.  Unless you're looking for a faded look, you want bold, black lines and that stay wash after wash.  I tend to ink up much more than i should, force of habit, but if i find it bleeding/the image is getting distorted then i back off and print a few newsprints.  I also add a cobalt drier compound to the ink, there are loads of drier products out there but this one seems to work best for getting shirts/patches/fabric to dry within 1-2 days otherwise the ink will take a long, long time to dry.  Other than that, more pressure, more ink, drier.  I sometimes add a piece of plexiglass on top of the print layed down in order to give an even amount of pressure and allow the press to ""roll up"" onto the print and shirt easier.  I hope this makes sense, PM me if you have any other questions"

Also if you wanna we relief printing shirts in action good ""Drive By Black"" or ""TugBoat Shirt"" they each do them slightly differently but it shows the process in 5-7 minutes   Edit: that last part was for the guy you were replying to  Edit 2: also I think the hardest thing in the art world is to make a style that is ""you"" something that when people see it they think ""oh that's _____'s work"" and I think that you have that.

printmaking,2b7um8,big_catalpa,1 point,Mon Jul 21 00:47:27 2014 UTC,"Cheers for the great feedback! I did have issues with the wood grain. The quality of the wood was fairly poor, it seemed to be some sort of plywood and wasn't particularly suitable for carving. I found I could only use certain cutting tools on the wood. I couldn't use a 1 blade as it couldn't carve through the wood effectively or the way normally a lino block would at all. So it was difficult to get small and intricate cuts. At certain points in the drum the wood would sort of crumple or tear off as I was carving it but it wasn't a huge trouble just something I observed working on it.  It was definitely detrimental to my cutting tools also, they noticeably deteriorated as I progressed through it and I'll definitely need to buy new blades after this.   However I would love to do this again and possibly progress to a full kit. I'd look into finding more suitable cutting tools for next time. I'd love to see some more stuff like that from you,.

printmaking,2b66jj,mequals1m1w,1 point,Tue Aug 12 14:36:05 2014 UTC,"Great cheers, i'll create a post with lots of images tomorrow, took 16 plus hours yesterday to take the show down, and 5 hours sleep.. then 5 hours work.. i was exhausted as it was an amazing few weeks, of none stop manual printing.. thats for asking.. be back tomorrow."
printmaking,2armv3,lassahnjs,5,Tue Jul 15 15:05:26 2014 UTC,"First off, you are my hero for actually doing some litho work. This sub is always so light on it and I appreciate another person who does it.   It's a very good image and I like what you're doing with it. Might I suggest maybe playing with textures a bit? For example, maybe use some autographed ink to make some the blacks more intense and possibly use of tusche to give the grassy field some depth? I am really impress you did it all with crayon, but I feel some other drawing materials can really help make it bolder."
printmaking,2armv3,industrial51,2,Tue Jul 15 23:00:11 2014 UTC,"Thanks! Both ideas on materials use are ones worth trying. I've got a big fresh stone ready and some other technical changes to consider for the next image, but I think it likely will include a greater variety of marks and materials."

printmaking,2ak7ec,ThyHolyPope,2,Sun Jul 13 03:52:24 2014 UTC,"I actually just picked up a small Line-o-scribe proofing press myself (along with a slew of lead type).  The machine itself works great, with little for repair needed outside of oiling and removing some rust.  The main issue is getting things to sit at type height.  I do a lot in wood, so my resolution was to buy a slightly thicker grade of MDF and raise it to type height with chipboard.  You can also buy a base from boxcarpress.com which raises the surface to type height.  These are more specifically designed for use with Photopolymer, so depending upon the thickness of your lino this may work."
printmaking,2ak7ec,Andrea1029,1 point,Sun Jul 13 15:39:11 2014 UTC,"I had one too. Works great for proofing linocut prints too, depending on the thickness of the plates. I used some thick cork to increase the height of the bed."

printmaking,2ace9d,FrostEntropy,2,Thu Jul 10 16:33:36 2014 UTC,"The best success I've had making monotypes has been with oil-based relief inks, actually.  And, especially since you'll be working without a press, you might think about choosing an ink that's easy to transfer by burnishing. I have no experience with the Charbonnel inks you're looking into, so I can't speak for or against them, personally. They do look high quality, if a bit expensive for at-home experimentation.   A word of warning: All the etching inks I've ever used were thick as cold tar, and, by themselves, don't really have the flow necessary to be terribly forgiving to pressless transferring. I'll assume that the vaseline and pudding you're describing are ink modifiers that help promote flow. (Maybe something like burnt plate oil?) If that's the case, skip the step of thinning the ink, and just start with a more fluid ink all together. If Charbonnel proves to be hard to handle, Gamblin's oil relief inks are not bad, all in all. I've certainly had some nice results using it, with the added bonus of having ink on hand for relief printing, which can also be done easily at home.  As for plates, before you place your order, check your local hardware store for plexi or polystyrene sheets. I imagine it'll yield the same results as the plates you have your eye on, with the added advantages of probably saving a few dollars and having an immediate local source for materials. I've been using plexi sheets for years, and have never been displeased with them.  What are your plans for paper?"
printmaking,2ace9d,justjokingnotreally,1 point,Thu Jul 10 19:55:53 2014 UTC,"Oh!  I forgot to mention that we used oil-based inks--and yes, they were super thick, and that's why we used the ink modifiers.  The Gamblin inks do look good, thanks for the link.  I'll check the hardware store for plexi/polystyrene sheets--thanks for the tip!  Haha, I also forgot to mention paper.  At the end of the course, our professor let us keep the left-over scrap paper we used for printing.  I've got a lot of good sized pieces, so I'm glad I don't have to worry about that.  Thank you so much for taking your time to respond, I really appreciate it!"

printmaking,2a8it4,ThyHolyPope,14,Wed Jul 9 13:21:31 2014 UTC,"Mod here.  Spam recently has been the worst I've ever seen in the history of this subreddit. I have a somewhat zero tolerance policy for small businesses, printing companies, essentially anyone looking for financial gain or with alternative motives not conducive to the subreddit.  A lot of you have been very, very helpful in calling out the spammers and I certainly appreciate all the help. Please do all of us a favor, report spam without hesitation, send me a message if things get real out of hand, be proactive. Again, I for one certainly appreciate it and I know the rest of the subreddit does.  I do what I can as far as checking in with the sub and removing spam. We all have lives outside of reddit and for me personally it's a luxury to be able to cruise on reddit for a few hours a day. I've often contemplated bringing in another mod to help out and maybe now is the time.  And just so you know - this is a small subreddit, a rant like this definitely gets heard."

printmaking,29u1pi,kisle,1 point,Sat Jul 5 01:08:46 2014 UTC,"Be very careful about what kind of linoleum you are using, older types of lino give off really toxic chemicals when burned.  I used Battleship Grey Lino from Dick Blick and we made sure to have proper ventilation and went slowly.  Overall if i were to do it again i would use a plywood instead, the issue is when there are thin lines in linoleum the pressure from the roller tends to crush them and you end up inking the background."

I'm fairly new to the multi block world, but basically what i've been doing is carving the key plate (the black layer) printing that onto a sheet of my crappy paper thats registered just like all my actual printing paper, run it thru the press, take the key plate off, put as new block in the same place as the key plate, run it thru, and Boom, you have the exact same image on plate #2, after that, i'll roughly go over everything with a pencil other wise i'll smudge it and loose the lines."

The inside edges were sealed with caulking. They drilled really small holes in the top of the box, about an inch apart on a grid, and then cut a hole in the side of the box that fits the tube of a vacuum hose. The hole was sealed with a duct tape wrap around the end of the hose so that you could jam it in the hole and would be flexible enough to seal it. It was a silly looking rig but it worked really well."

printmaking,26qi8f,EMCME,5,Wed May 28 22:25:49 2014 UTC,"It really depends on what kind of ink you're using. If you're using water-based, than I think just about anything (soap and water) should work.  For oil-based ink, many people do their initial clean up with corn oil, plenty of rags, and some elbow grease. Once you've wiped away all you can with the oil (which is really a helluva lot), then bring a little solvent into the picture. (A downside to that is now you have an abundance of flammable, oil soaked rags sitting around. Ah, printmaking.)"
printmaking,26qi8f,big_catalpa,1 point,Wed May 28 23:40:23 2014 UTC,"In my old shop, we used varsol for everything. They had a laundered rag system which took care of all the solvent smell. New shop is oil and vinegar [for oil based inks] and vegetable oil for rubber based inks. No rag system, but everyone's expected to have their own Blue Shop Towels."
printmaking,26qi8f,kissnellie,4,Thu May 29 03:20:19 2014 UTC,"An extremely effective, safe, and easy cleaner is a mixture of oil, soap, and water.  Approximately 10% soap, 15% oil (veggie/corn oil), and 75% water.  It works amazingly well for cleaning up oil-based inks.  The oil loosens the ink and the soap links the oil and water.  You just need to shake the bottle well before use.  I follow that with a little diluted (10:1) simple green and use water for the wash.  If you are looking to clean asphaltum off of etching plates I would suggest soysolv, it is really oily but does a good job"
printmaking,26qi8f,TweeterMonkeyMan,2,Wed May 28 23:47:43 2014 UTC,In my the old printshop we used just plain cooking oil to remove oil based ink. After you remove all the oil just give everything a quick clean with windex! In my new print shop we use estisol first then soapy water. I'm pretty sure you can only buy estisol in huge barrels though.
printmaking,26qi8f,Blackagenda,2,Thu May 29 01:35:15 2014 UTC,"My printmaking professor was really concerned about health and didn't want to use anything toxic, so we always used vegetable oil to get the ink cleaned up, then vinegar to get rid of the oily residue. It was pretty effective."

printmaking,25woyw,TheSkinnyD,2,Mon May 19 14:11:43 2014 UTC,"It's a pretty fun combination of DIY and techie skills that can make some cool prints!   Depending on what kind of laser cutter you have, acetate should cut fine—high speed, med/med high power. (If you happen to use a Universal, the settings are 70/100/res4 to 50/100/res4 for something like 60W, 100W would be about 20/80 or so, depending on thickness.)  You can also use paper if you are planning to use the stencil for just one print run.   You place your paper (to be printed on) below your screen, then position the stencil how you want it, lower your screen and do a pull. The ink will adhere the stencil to the screen. Magic! It works great with transparent inks. Here's an example!"

printmaking,25osdq,calembo,1 point,Thu May 22 21:05:12 2014 UTC,"Hello!  I'm afraid a plexiglass drypoint is not an etching. (I'm surprised your tutors don't tell you this!). An etching is where a metal plate is immersed in acid or corrosive salts to eat away or ""bite"" the plate. This action is controlled by the artist by coating the plate (laying a ground) in certain selected areas.  That is why I asked what you had used as a ""ground"". Conversely, a drypoint or engraving is made by scribing directly on the plate - in this case plexiglass. The actual printing process is similar - the artist wipes the ink from the raised surface of the plate. An artist printmaker can create all kinds of effects by delicate wiping. The Japanese printmakers were (and are) particularly skilled at this.  You have now embarked on a long journey, this is a fascinating form of art, requiring both artistic vision and technical expertise. Well done! I look forward to seeing your progress, you've made a terrific start as an artist printmaker."

Particularly where the figures legs end in a fade, and where the mushrooms are coming so close to the figure. The pattern on the bottom seems like it is going back far, but the figure and animal feel relatively close to us with nothing grounding them in that space. It's also hard to tell how all of these things are working together conceptually at this point. Just throwing it out there to think about since you said you are stuck.

C) the print gods hate you and just didn't want your dog to print... but i'm guessing it was A or B  Also, i think that your multi block print is the weakest of the three. although it is registered fairly well, i think the overall linework/ detail is lacking. if you look at the elephant, and the linework of that, use that as a key plate, then add color to enhance the print, i think it would help you a lot...  ex: http://www.tugboatprintshop.com/INFO_process.htm look at some of those and how they use a key plate, and then add color. i think it will help you if you think about it that way.

When you begin a press run, be sure to check with other people who are more experienced and get their take on the proper pressure.

printmaking,253u9u,i_am_artist,3,Fri May 9 10:09:37 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you have to make it into a halftone.  To put is simply. Get your image into photoshop and change it to Bitmap (image>mode>bitmap) [you may have to change it to greyscale THEN bitmap] it will then ask you some questions about how you want to change the mode. Select ""Halftone Screen"" and you should be good.   It is a bit more complex than that  but a quick google for ""convert to halftone in photoshop"" will get what you need.   EDIT: This is what it will look like you could actually use this image as your positive if you want :)  EDIT EDIT: Or this one Using a lower dot count."

printmaking,253u9u,metaphorever,1 point,Fri May 9 12:47:40 2014 UTC,"No worries.  Just a heads up on mesh size. 90T is equal to about a 230 mesh. I take it you are an aussie, we use the ""T"" mesh system while americans use a different rule. (it is by inch rather than cm)  To keep things easy, use the lower dot count. 90t is pretty fine so you can use a higher dot count, but it will need to be correctly setup.   I would also suggest looking up youtube vids of all aspects of screen printing, I learnt more form doing that than when i was at uni.   Good luck!"

Most of the time I just end up with a mushy version of the first print, but I'd say once out of every twenty times I do it I get something that's at least just as good as the first print.  Alternatively, if you're good with registration and lining the plate up you can print multiple times onto the same sheet.  This gives you opportunities to adjust things that came out lighter or not as well developed as you may have hoped.  Like this artist does.  (I like monotypes)"

printmaking,24x9up,ThyHolyPope,3,Wed May 7 13:04:12 2014 UTC,"It's something I stumbled upon when printing photos. I accidentally printed one on the wrong side of the photo paper. The ink didn't soak in, but just sort of sat there, but instead of throwing it away I tried pressing a piece of photo paper on it and voila...my first inkjet monotype. I'm experimenting with the process more now and have added various other paper types that are ink resistant. It's fascinating because you get different effects based on how you set it to print. Each paper type, combined with each quality level, create different effects... And as a photographer it's fun to create unique prints of my favorite images.

printmaking,24x5d1,humanartist,2,Wed May 7 17:11:44 2014 UTC,"Hello there. I actually work at blick and ordered the 999 model II press and eventually sold it. Not because the quality wasnt up to par but It wasnt good for aquatints I wanted. Line etchings did just fine though, but it didnt have the pressure to do a quality aquatint. I believe I still have a review up for the 999 press under yamaHOG rider, where I talk about the quality of the press if youre interested.   Anyway my main point to share with you is that    A) if youre doing etchings I realized It was a MAJOR hassle to properly store and purchases nitric acid. My local shop was much better for 30 bucks a session.  B) For linocuts a letter press can be purchased or made for cheaper. C)Most importantly you must understand size matter with a press. As you may have noticed in class the presses are huge. thats partly because when you are applying a lot of pressure down the torque causes the press to buck around if its too light as I found out. and then, the reason I ultimately sold the press was because the wheel wasnt a wheel. It was three sticks that made it very difficult to turn the bed under a high pressure. Even woodcuts would be difficult  as well as linocuts. To be honest a cheap press doesnt exist. BUT if you want to go for it have a manager special order the item to the store and show them a 40% off coupon and youll be straight. At that point you can always sell it for 100 bucks more then you paid for it on craigs list like I did :)"
printmaking,24x5d1,humanartist,1 point,Wed May 7 06:39:45 2014 UTC,"Thank you, this really helps! Would you say that linocuts were alright with the press? I don't plan on making or doing etching plates on this press (what a disaster it would be to bring acid into my house!) but I do plan on doing linos and solarplates.   I wish there was a Blick store near me so I could try it for myself before I bought it. However your comment helped a lot. I think unless I find a better option I might still get the 906 and see if its flaws are a deal breaker for me.  Also, could I have the link to your review?    Thanks again!"

However It is totally worth the drive to go to a store and special order it because you can take the shipping tax out of the equation and you can probably get them to give you 30% off too....At least my store would but I live in LA :) but call first if youre willing to make the drive. Ya linocuts will work fine. solar plates will probably be ok too because they are really thin buttt you still need a lot of pressure to get the details in the print. I say go for it!

printmaking,24ewd3,WHAAAAAAAM,2,Thu May 1 00:02:21 2014 UTC,"For solar plates?  I built one. I can't remember the book that had the instructions in it, so I'll do the best I can to explain it. this book might be a good resource. Can't remember if it's the one my ex wife had or no  image of project  Build a wooden frame larger than the largest plate you intend to etch. Remember this must fit inside your solar exposure cabinet/box.  You can make the frame out of nearly anything. You're essentially just making a wooden square/rectangle, but I think you want it to be 1"" thick material at least.  Stretch a flexible rubber sheet over the frame. I used a shower liner, but it was very thick, and the folds never quite straightened out. (Glue or staple the rubber sheet to the frame.) I believe i stapled.  Buy a plastic suction cup. Diameter should be 1"" or larger. Preferably larger, like 2"". Drill a hole completely through the suction cup in the middle using 1/4"" drill bit.  Insert (and glue) a 1/4"" rubber line into the suction cup.   In one of the corners of your stretched rubber frame, you're going to cut a hole. Make this hole about 1/3 the diameter of the suction cup's diameter.  So you will have the rubber sheet stretched over the wooden frame with a hole cut in its corner. On the UNDERSIDE of the rubber (like looking at the back of a framed piece of artwork), glue the suction cup directly over the hole you cut in the rubber sheet so that the center of your holes in the rubber as well as the suction cup are centered and aligned.  Drill a hole in the side of the wooden frame near your glued suction cup and thread your 1/4"" plastic tube (that's glued into the suction cup) through it. This will allow your wooden frame to sit flat on a table with the plastic tube running out the side.  Set your wooden frame on the table, stretched rubber side up.  Take a piece of kite string or something similar. You will need a length long enough to go from the suction cup, around the outer edges of your frame, and back. Glue one end to the rubber hole.  Now all you will need is a piece of glass larger than your wooden frame. This will go on top of your vacuum box.  For the vacuum part, you can use a vacuum sealer or take the compressor out of a refrigerator. Connect your rubber tube (that goes to the suction cup) to the vacuum.  Place your plate on the stretched rubber of your frame. Circle your plate with the kite string. This prevents the rubber from immediately contacting the glass directly above the suction cup, and instead makes the entire rubber sheet rise to meet the glass. Place the glass sheet on top of your plate and vacuum box.  Turn on your compressor. You should get a tight seal.  If not, you can purchase weather stripping. On the back side of your vacuum box (like looking at the back of a painting), you can adhere the weather stripping around the inside edge of the wooden frame. This will create a bit of a cushion for the glass to sit on and should create a better seal.  Good  luck. I hope I explained this well enough."

printmaking,23qrv1,ryadicaledward,1 point,Wed Apr 23 05:47:42 2014 UTC,"Thanks, I was taking a french class at the same time as printmaking and it was my second term with that french professor. He was fantastic and made a joke about cats, so I was inspired to make it a print for him. I used a rosin box, but did it a couple of times due to the first not going well."

printmaking,23qrv1,luciteangel,1 point,Wed May 7 16:20:32 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much. I was going for that kind of contrast, I'll make sure to post a follow-up once I clean up the plate a bit and add a few fixes.."
printmaking,23qrv1,pencilears,2,Thu May 8 01:58:48 2014 UTC,"contrary to other opinions on this thread I think that most of your aquatinting (outside your lettering) looks like hell. it's almost a completely uniform solid grey except the parts where you appear to have partially cleaned it off in the middle. and that destroys any lingering sense of depth to the image.  your line-work is gorgeous, but I want you do go in and burnish that antiquatinted background until it looks less flat overall."
printmaking,23qrv1,luciteangel,2,Wed Apr 23 18:16:11 2014 UTC,"thanks a bunch, I agree, I was going for a soft cloudy look with the texture in the back (haha) and those flowers on the bottom look terrible :p    I was a bit afraid of over or under coloring, and my actual setting of the aquatint with the rosin box was a bit botched, so I see a lot of fuzzy I don't like...I really want to if not do the same design over again, edit this one and clean it up. In my head it was cleaner and the shades had much more contrast.  But I do like it overall, just wish it were better."
printmaking,23oqi1,flick_nightshade,4,Tue Apr 22 15:51:52 2014 UTC,Try engraving with resin grave or intaglio metal plates if you are looking for fine line detail. Hardwood for engraving is just stupid expensive. Try resin grave first. Another thing I do is print my several Lino blocks on transparencies then expose screens with them. The combination I media opens so many doors. Plus Chuck Close (his assistants) did it so it's not cheating.
printmaking,23oqi1,NixBesser,2,Tue Apr 22 18:05:35 2014 UTC,"If you're looking to branch out in terms of detail, research wood engraving. Detail is unmatched in wood engravings, even more so than linoleum blocks. The difference between woodcuts and wood engravings  is that woodcuts are carved on a long plank of wood but the engravings are carved into cross sections of a piece of wood. If you just google wood engravings I have a feeling you'll be pretty impressed.  The tools that are used are also different... Engraving tools have less of a handle and are designed to be used by holding it against the palm of the hand, giving more leverage and control I suppose. They also have smaller sharper tips to achieve the super fine detail.  If you're into relief printing like linocuts, woodcuts, etc., I suggest really trying to experiment with the range of textures and mark making that you can achieve. You can literally print relief on almost anything. Try carving into MDF or chipboard. I've seen a piece where the person found a broken old desk in the trash and carved into a part of that. It had some awesome textures and borders and ended up being a really beautiful print after they worked into it.  Also try collagraphs; they are somewhat similar to monotypes. Or even other printmaking techniques like copper plate etching or lithography, although you would need the proper equipment for things like that.  Overall I'd say experiment and have fun with it! You never know what you may stumble upon that you'll fall in love with. I think printmaking as a whole is often thought of as being very restricted and rule-based. While that is somewhat true, being that printmaking is very process oriented, there is no reason to stay cooped up in what you were taught or what you think must be done. Try new things and experiment! It's art; have fun and do whatever the fuck you want! :)"
printmaking,23oqi1,thedevilsdictionary,1 point,Tue Apr 22 16:28:48 2014 UTC,"You don't need much for copper other than a bucket of acid and a hot surface. I'm not sure what people do with tints at home but that's not technical either.   I'd imagine running a desk through requires a decent press. Seriously. Can you recommend one that accepts a wide variety of materials and isn't $160,000?  I saw a guy at High Point who uses the floor from old gyms."
printmaking,23oqi1,MoonMakerIII,1 point,Wed Apr 23 00:32:58 2014 UTC,If you like the feel of lino but feel it loses its details use sintra. It's like a pic pipe rolled out flat. Super cheap and holds up to lots and lots of prints without getting squishy. Also a knife set might be a good investment.
printmaking,23oqi1,brotherbunsen,1 point,Tue Apr 22 21:10:44 2014 UTC,"I love copper plate etching - I can still un one-off plates, but I can also mount the plates type-high and print from them on letterpress.  Additionally, the detail simply can't be beat without machined plates.  You will need a lot of equipment to do it right, and it can be expensive.  But it's quite fulfilling."
printmaking,23oqi1,thedevilsdictionary,1 point,Tue Apr 22 22:18:40 2014 UTC,"You're the second person to say copper requires a lot. I don't feel that way at all. It's etch, varnish and some dust.   Meanwhile I cannot find a versatile etching press that I'd trust for under $3K. That's the big hurdle for everything I want to do."
printmaking,23oqi1,Existentialist,1 point,Wed Apr 23 00:39:19 2014 UTC,"relief and high detail, try using HIIPS, or similair hard plastics that will hold up. Johanna Mueller uses it in her art and gets amazing engraving pieces.  If you can't find that I'll suggest finding MDF board in 3/4 thickness, you can pick it up at home depot. That thickness holds under press best in my opinion, and you can use both sides fairly easily.  As far as silk screen goes, I have a few suggestions. Use a high mesh count, maybe around 230 plus. Pair that with some clear mylar/acetat sheets, and use some mylar pens, or any super dark pen (sharpie doesn't count), and you can get some nice detail from fine point pens."
printmaking,23oqi1,thedevilsdictionary,0,Wed Apr 23 01:02:29 2014 UTC,Wood is for masochists. Especially the reduction ones. Id stay away.   I love Lino myself and am decent at it. I've enjoyed working intaglio copper plates but that's tough as hell. If detail is what you want look into it as well as aquatinting.   Otherwise I do encourage anyone to make some dry monoprints on plexi. Cut out some paper shapes and toss them in with multiple layers (lining it up and calibrating can be hard but otherwise it's child's play) and you're going to get amazing results that usually surprise you. Relinquish some control and feel liberated. On reliefs you know every stroke.
printmaking,23oqi1,Borgoff,3,Tue Apr 22 16:13:20 2014 UTC,"I guess I'm a masochist. I like working with 3/8 shina ply from McClain's. I was never a fan of lino because it never held up to the level of detail I wanted to be carving. They offer grab bags of small cutoff pieces. If you don't mind working that small, it's like $5 for 2 pounds of wood.  Other than that I totally agree about copper and monoprints. Add in some plexiglass drypoint for a very affordable way to add more looseness and variety in line quality."
printmaking,23oqi1,thedevilsdictionary,1 point,Tue Apr 22 16:27:15 2014 UTC,Damn. I don't know if I ever tried plexi dry point. I think in college they used aluminum sheets.   I don't feel I could manage wood with the sizes I want and the detail is sufficient for me. I like the traditional pond or reef setting for my print subject and everything flows together.   Now if I was doing fall or a deck of cards (a dream I had dashed because I suck at copper designs) then yeah. Perfect! Otherwise it's too much work.
printmaking,23oqi1,Borgoff,2,Wed Apr 23 00:26:02 2014 UTC,"I usually work with 12x16 blocks. I have a couple of 11x17 in reserve for some sketches I'm still fleshing out, and a big box of scrap pieces that I like to do still lives and studies with.  I've used home-depot birch plywood in the past and it's unbelievably hard to carve. There's practically equal amounts of glue and wood, it dulls your blades in no time, and the birch veneer chips off from the pressure of making a parallel cut.  The only other wood I've carved on and loved besides the shina ply is actually a cherry grilling plank. One of the local markets sells them in a pack of 3 for you to soak in water and grill meat or fish on. They're not the best carving, but they add some gorgeous rings and wood grain as well as a border from still having the bark on. A few words of warning though, you'll probably have to seal both sides of it and let it dry for a solid week before you can print it. They warp like crazy."
printmaking,23oqi1,thedevilsdictionary,2,Wed Apr 23 00:36:37 2014 UTC,Jesus. You're talking about the wood I said was for masochists. I think ply and the old zinc plates are the most hardcore.   But I'm sorry I dismissed all wood. I guess it has many facets and grain directions. Lol. The board you cook salmon on? I wonder if I can eat off it first? I've always wanted to try cooking with those.
printmaking,23oqi1,Borgoff,2,Wed Apr 23 00:44:04 2014 UTC,"It's all personal preference. I didn't take very well to intaglio when I was in school, plus the natural-ness of wood really lends itself to my themes (I'm an outdoor junkie).   You probably can't grill on one and then use it for printmaking. I've cooked on them in the past and the parts that aren't charred to death end up covered in scraps of fish.  You could probably carve one, print the raw wood with something edible like curry paste or food coloring gel, and have delicious art before you throw a slab of fish on it and grill it. Limited edition for sure."

printmaking,23iwjn,killcrash,1 point,Sun Apr 20 21:50:00 2014 UTC,If you're on a budget go with a paint on emulsion. It is sometimes hard to work with but the results are pretty good. Also you can go a long way with packing tape.

printmaking,236kht,luciteangel,2,Thu Apr 17 13:31:43 2014 UTC,"Well i'd like to start by saying i really like what you have going here. but since you asked for a crit, i'll try to give you some feedback.  1) the words (""gas"", ""ola__""): so this is just kind of something that bugs me but i feel that words/ letters are one of the easiest ways to make a print/ artpiece look amateurish. even though it is easy to put words in, doing them so they look good is much harder (esp in print where you are doing them in reverse). the print has this very elegant/ simple/ thought out line work, and then your words look like they were written by a 1st grader, which is distracting, not to mention a lot of times when you have words in a piece the viewer will often be drawn to those, because, well we've been trained to read things. it seems like those 2 objects are relitively trivial and not suppose to hold any more importance than the rest of the objects so why put words on them? is is essensial that we know thats a gas can, or that that is an Ola(y)? jar? if not i say don't worry about spelling it out.  2) Lines: So again, i really like your lineworks so far , i especially like the umbrella and the bike tire, but what your line work is missing is variation. use line weight and the etching process to your advantage, make some lines more pronounced to emphasis the focal points/ the difference foreground/backround and just make things pop more.   also like haiku said, you could use aquatinting achieve more variation.   3) composition: i usually don't like centralized compositions, but you've pulled it off nicely. i think you've created a nice balance between the clutter of the bottom, and a nice simple elegance on the top.  i could keep going but i think thats enough for now. all in all, nice work."

printmaking,22nzf9,Indexical_Objects,1 point,Thu Apr 10 05:09:44 2014 UTC,"It makes me so happy to read ""burnish edges of plate for easy cleaning"".  In my experience, closer attention to clean plate edges is the number one thing that beginning or intermediate intaglio artists could do to improve their work technically.    If you haven't ever used one of these deburring tools before give it a try too.  I like using them between filing a working bevel and burnishing, but some people are good enough with them that this is the only tool they ever use on plate edges."

printmaking,2275h2,ThyHolyPope,2,Sat Apr 5 01:45:43 2014 UTC,"It does take longer to dry. I usually leave them for a day or two and then iron them to heat set (and I actually don't even know if that's necessary, I just do it).   Are you using a press? I've only printed woodcuts on t-shirts with an etching press, I don't think it would work by hand, unless you're globbing on ink and ""stamping"" them, but I can't imagine you'll get much detail that way. However if your design doesnt require much detail, that could possibly work. If doing it by hand, I would actually recommend using as little ink as possible, and stepping on them on the floor. (Make sure you have something inside the shirt to keep it from seeping to the back).   As for clean up, turpentine is faster and more effective. You can use corn oil or vegetable oil for most of it, but that can get pretty messy. However, a linoleum block will be easier to clean than a woodblock."

printmaking,222ler,keejomatic,2,Thu Apr 3 02:56:27 2014 UTC,"The pressure may have been too high on the press, or the ink may have been too 'tacky'. Perhaps try using more transparent base or plate oil in the ink or just a thinner layer of ink. You may want to do a test with a scrap of the hosho just to see how it reacts to different ink viscosities and maybe to see if their is a side of the paper that is textured better for your needs."

printmaking,222ler,ThyHolyPope,2,Thu Apr 3 17:56:31 2014 UTC,"a lot of issues with printmaking are about problem solving your way out of problems, since its not always an ""is X is wrong all you have to change is Y."" theres many simple factors that could be the issue, could be the paper, could be the ink, could be the press/ pressure. so besides what other people have said so far some things i would suggest:  1) check if your college has a papermaking class, the prof who teaches that class might be able to tell you if its something wrong with the paper/ if there is anything you can do about it  2) try hand printing. since we're just problem shooting here, don't use a whole sheet, use a smaller test piece of the paper. ink up the corner (or something) put the paper over that area, and newsprint on top of that. use either a buren or the bottom side of a spoon to rub the area. that you inked up. (a wooden or bamboo spoon works really well for this)  these are just 2 suggestions, and i'm sure with problem solving you should be able to figure it out.   BUT if all else fails and you still want to use this paper, but can't get it to print without crumbling/ falling apart, you could try coating the paper with something to toughen up the surface. something like a spray startch, or a transparent coat of silkscreen ink, or something like a working fixative spray.  like the other people said, its hard to know what to do without being there/ seeing it, but GL."
printmaking,222ler,ThyHolyPope,1 point,Thu Apr 3 14:48:49 2014 UTC,"Thank you so much for your suggestions! We don't have a papermaking class, but I'll ask the head of the printmaking department (who specializes in relief printing,) she might have some ideas. I would really like to try hand printing. If hand printing doesn't tear my paper up and I decide to go with that, do I still use a jig? The requirement for this assignment is to produce an edition of 4."

printmaking,21y1f2,Existentialist,3,Wed Apr 2 03:44:11 2014 UTC,"Depends on what kind of prints you make and where you are. Etching, litho, letterpress, offset, etc you'll need a press. If you're in a larger city there are usually studios with presses that you can become a member of or use for a fee. I know of several in Chicago and have heard of studios around other cities.

But I'm not sure it's the right medium for you, it's so precise and graphic-y, and doesn't maintain the square of the page, so silkscreen might be the more obvious medium. Wood often looks best when you let the natural grain of the wood come through in places. Some ideas naturally just lend themselves to certain mediums. It's a very good start though, and you clearly have some good skills to continue and progress. Good luck!"

printmaking,1zwjns,the3hrd,5,Sat Mar 8 17:56:06 2014 UTC,"Printmaking is a really broad term, so it depends what you want to learn. Under the umbrella of printmaking, there are a bunch of generic headers. Unless you genuinely want to learn about every single type at once, I would pick one, start there and dive in. This link is on the sidebar because it covers the types of printmaking and is very handy.   Types of Printmaking;    Reliefs - this is where the ink sits on the surface. Typically done on wood or lino, but one could use any variety of medium.  Etchings - this is where the ink sits in lines that have been ""etched"" into something. Usually done on copper, zinc or steel. When you place your paper on top of the plate and roll it through the press, it absorbs the ink from the lines to the paper.  Screenprinting - one creates a sort of resist, so the ink can go through the parts of the screen that you want the image to be in. silkscreening is another word for it.  Lithography - I'm in litho but have trouble explaining it. Can be done on a stone [etching into the stone /or ""burning""] or digitally with offset printing [burning, similar to dark room photography].    There are a bunch of techniques, such as chine colle, monotyping, multiplate techniques, the list goes on, that can be used to enhance or add to what you're doing with one of the techniques above."

On a personal note, I don't personally trust the title of ""Master Printer"" these days.  In a culture that no longer has the truly intensive apprenticeships of the past, it's a meaningless term.  Some Master Printers have been printing for four years, others for forty.  Some people call themselves Master Printer simply because they own a shop, or even just a single press.  Some programs will train you to be a ""master,"" but teach only litho, or only letterpress.  Other programs won't ""bestow"" the ""title"" until you've certified in multiple disciplines.  If somebody called themselves a Master Printer, I would make three assumptions - 1) that person is pretentious, and 2) that person's going to lose a finger sooner than later due to their own overconfidence, and 3) unless he looks like father Christmas, the average hobby printmaker will know more than him.  I know a guy I would consider to be a master printer.  His shop has at least 50 different presses, he can strip and rebuild a Heidelberg with his teeth and both hands tied behind his back, and he could repair any piece of printing tech from a Konica Minolta industrial offset printer to an 18th century ink ball.  If you called him a Master Printer, I think he'd probably have a stroke."

I enjoy the act of printing just as much as the development of the plate, I really wouldn't mind helping others print as well as pulling my own.  Can I ask about this guy you know?  He sounds like my kind of guy."
printmaking,1zu4zg,Blackagenda,2,Sat Mar 8 02:48:52 2014 UTC,"Generally all the master printers I know/ know of are technicians at well known art universities. The only place I know where you can get the ""title"" is at tamarind in New Mexico but that is specifically for lithography. I guess it all depends on your definition of a master printer. If you want print for others and have the title as the master printer than the best bet is as a tech or to open your own studio."

printmaking,1zu4zg,jenjenpaints,2,Sat Mar 8 02:57:51 2014 UTC,"I would love to own my own press.   Owning your own press is easy - they're practically throwing them away around the country nowadays.  A couple hundred for new rollers, a new gripper arm here, some rust removal there, you can usually be operational for under $500 if you know where to look, who to ask, and when it's worth waiting for the better deal."
printmaking,1zu4zg,brotherbunsen,1 point,Sat Mar 8 03:05:59 2014 UTC,Go on...  I would love a few good ideas of how to find a decent press of my own on the cheap. Who is throwing the presses away and how can I get in touch with them?
printmaking,1zu4zg,jenjenpaints,2,Sat Mar 8 06:13:48 2014 UTC,"Well, step one is to put out feelers with press operators in your area and know that you are looking.  It's a tight-knit group of mostly middle-to-advanced age men, so they tend to a) know each other, b) retire frequently, and c) die unexpectedly.  If you let them know you want to learn more about press-work, they might be able to point you to somebody or another - step two is to take whatever help they offer you, whether you need it or not, and learn and accumulate materials as you go.  Eventually, you'll find one of them heard about a lady whose husband died and left a Heidelberg in a garage somewhere (a nightmare to restore as a first press) or an old Kelsey tabletop in the basement, or a couple of C&Ps at his old packaging factory, or whatever.  You'll typically hear the phrase ""sell for scrap.""  Get the number, call that person, tell them you'd be happy to move the press for them, give them whatever they were going to get in scrap value (no more than a few hundred dollars for a full-size press) plus something extra for their trouble.  It is universally my experience that they then also ask if you can get rid of their jobbing cases, lead type, plates, inks, furniture, and a million other printing tools and pieces of equipment that they also have with the press.  The thing about this is that a Vandercook, for example, goes for $8,000 - $15,000 on the market.  But there is no market.  So people stand around waiting for nobody to buy their press, and then eventually give up and get $250 for it as scrap.  You have to find them in the window before they scrap it, and after they've realized they aren't actually going to get the price people are asking on eBay for the same model.  If you're really, really lucky, you can skip all this.  I've walked into lettpress shops before and said ""hey, that's a beautiful windmill"" just to have someone say ""yeah, I got it to replace the old Excelsior in the corner.  If you can move it, you can have it.""  The secret is simply patience.  You can't go looking for a free or cheap press and expect to find it that weekend.  You have to jump on the opportunities you find, however, very quickly.  Anyhow, that's how I got all but one of my presses.  I foolishly paid almost $1000 for my first C&P OS 8x12 (though it was a steal even at that price, and came with some nice generic plates and a cabinet."

printmaking,1zox3g,autowikibot,1 point,Tue May 13 09:15:53 2014 UTC,"Steamroller:       A steamroller (or steam roller) is a form of road roller – a type of heavy construction machinery used for levelling surfaces, such as roads or airfields – that is powered by a steam engine. The levelling/flattening action is achieved through a combination of the size and weight of the vehicle and the rolls: the smooth wheels and the large cylinder or drum fitted in place of treaded road wheels.  The majority of steam rollers are outwardly similar to traction engines as many traction engine manufacturers later produced rollers based on their existing designs, and the patents owned by certain roller manufacturers tended to influence the general arrangements used by others. The key difference between the two vehicles is that on a roller the main roll replaces the front wheels and axle that would be fitted to a traction engine.  In many parts of the world, the term steam roller is still used regardless of the method of propulsion. This typically only applies to the largest examples (used for road-making).

printmaking,1zgwcm,the3hrd,2,Tue Mar 4 00:46:29 2014 UTC,What does reduction mean? (Sorry for the probable stupid question but I'm very new to printmaking)
printmaking,1zgwcm,the3hrd,6,Tue Mar 4 02:54:17 2014 UTC,"basically its when you use one plate to print, but each layer you print you remove more material so that. i find its easier if you look at it with some discrpitions so.... http://imgur.com/a/tofUS"
printmaking,1zgwcm,pugglez,2,Tue Mar 4 03:52:49 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the great, informative reply! So you can only get one print this way vs an unlimited amount with a non-suicide plate?"
printmaking,1zgwcm,drawmattix,6,Tue Mar 4 04:20:37 2014 UTC,"well you can print as many as you want, Lets say you want to do an edition of 10, so you print 10 of the first layer, carve away the 2nd layer, print that, and 5 of the 10 turned out, theres no way to go back and make more of them since you already destroyed the first layer by making the 2nd layer. does that make sense?"

printmaking,1zi2qa,meLIZZZZZma,1 point,Tue Mar 4 06:01:57 2014 UTC,"Depending on what kind of ink you are using, hand printing on lino may be easier, because the ink won't be slightly absorbed (as with wood) so it won't dry as fast. In my experience, hand printing with oil based ink seems to be okay if I have worked the ink to a nice kind of runny consistency. Working with water based ink is easier if you have ink retarder.  The bigger your linoleum, the more likely you will have issues with printing a clear image as a result of drying. Also the more of a work out your arm will get.  Consider the temperature of the room you're in. Too cold or too hot will quicken drying time."

Compared to wood there is only inking differences that /u/meLIZZZZZma pointed out. I personally favor lino blocks because I find the grain of the wood can be stubborn, and (atleast with the wood I've used) I found myself sharpening my tools a lot more often with wood to get the desired control I wanted."

I do a similar style but nowhere near as good as yours. Lots of inspiration, here, for me :D  I'm wondering what your process is like. Do you draw directly onto your blocks, or do you draw on paper and transfer them? If so, how do you plan your white lines (particularly the hatching which is drool worthy)?

Wood sometimes can have a different look than lino, but in many cases they can appear interchangeable [once again, this depends on the type of wood and also the look you want].  If it's your first time, I would make your image however you want to [digitally in your case] and print it onto standard printer paper. Cover the back in red or black conte and lay down onto a lino block. Take a standard pen and trace your design on the front of the page, letting it transfer the conte onto the block. You could use carbon paper too."

I've seen other pneumatic presses of this style that are a little better, but even those have frequent wobble and warping issues.  If you want to make prints in that size range reliably with a basic, homemade press, you should get a press screw and do it up into a copy press - it's more stable, easier to control pressure, easier to use with plates, etc. if you need to change print methods later.  Check out a basic build version here.  Though I will say that I would just find a letterpress eventually.  If you're willing to wait around, you can find a 10x15 C&P Old Style for free every year or so if you keep your eyes open.  The cost of moving it when you find one somebody is dumping is well worth the wait."

You know all the block letters and numbers you see at flea markets and what not? They're all the same height, and a printmaker puts them together to form words and whatnot, and gets them all tightly set together. Using a letterpress they are rolled with ink, and then printed on paper. Those little houses you got there can be included with the words. They are the same height, and the image area is ever so slightly raised to take the ink. They are very neat. Also fairly worthless. But neat!"

printmaking,1yx1xm,kissnellie,1 point,Wed Feb 26 02:33:06 2014 UTC,"Hard to tell from the photo but what sort of surface texture is on them? Would they hold ink?   Letterpress is my best guess at what these blocks were used for. Many large cities and such have letterpress collectives, shops, workshops, studios, etc. Perhaps if you reached out to one, they could help you identify how they were originally used and if it is letterpress type, they might be able to print them for you."

printmaking,1yrd5o,wekk,1 point,Fri Feb 28 04:11:19 2014 UTC,"I'd say test out the image on a piece of wood or other scrap first. If it is etching a raster, most laser cutters work in side to side passes and if you inspect it closely, you'll see it as a tight grouping of straight, often horizontal lines. In some machines you can fiddle with the resolution of the laser, to have it use less passes, which would result in more lines."
printmaking,1yolsw,helpmefindalaptop,2,Sun Feb 23 05:27:00 2014 UTC,"I have had a set of the Shinwa's for years and continue to use them regularly. They are a great intermediate and will cut well unless you're using harder wood or end-grain pieces, perfect if you are primarily doing lino. I don't have any experience with the Swiss tools but if you are looking for something a step up I highly suggest Flexcut tools, they are fantastic and will last a lifetime."
printmaking,1yolsw,cporters,1 point,Sun Feb 23 06:48:56 2014 UTC,For a little more money I got a six piece namisei set: http://www.imcclains.com/catalog/woodblocktools/namiseisetof6.html  They're great tools and little better than the power grips but I think it mostly just comes down to personal preference.  If you have large or small hands the namisei might be better for you since you'll need to cut them down to fit your hand anyways.  The other advantage to going with McClains is that you can mix and match if you buy a set.  If you've been using your squirrel set for a while and know what you like and dislike that might be worth it.

printmaking,1yflov,kissnellie,2,Thu Feb 20 22:22:09 2014 UTC,"thought of another thing while looking at this,   so, you're running into problems because you're trying to draw white lines with your cuts onto the black. what you need to do is sketch everything out on your block and then cut away the negative spaces, and cut away the light in blocks. most of those little feather lines should be black. think about it as spot-blacks, and consider how you are going to organize the patterning and the composition when you draw them out.  also the feather that goes right into the face of the bird is a bit jarring. you need to think about how the lines draw the eye and interact with one another. thicker lines can either recede or come forward but they need to be paired with thiner lines to do their job. right now, the line widths are all the same, so the head of the bird appears to be just as deep as the tail feathers.  unlike everybody else, I don't think there is a good way to introduce color to this unless you are willing to completely re-do the block. but I am also biased against color."
printmaking,1yflov,pencilears,1 point,Sat Feb 22 07:16:48 2014 UTC,Possibly looking for feedback. Really enjoy this medium. Not sure what to do next though to test what I can do I guess.

printmaking,1yflov,GingerG89,4,Thu Feb 20 15:33:46 2014 UTC,I agree. Really nice image though. A bit of reduction printing with really vibrant colours could look great with it!
printmaking,1yflov,ThyHolyPope,2,Thu Feb 20 16:32:27 2014 UTC,"Besides what others said about more ink, I think you should think a little bit more about your boarders. Not that you can't have boarders, but if you do I feel that they should be fairly even. Right now the sides are too wide, the bottom is to small and the top, is probably ok ( all size judgements are relative to the other sides. Your carving, especially for your first time is really good, and if you stick with Lino, I'd recommend starting to incorporate color, either through suicide prints, multiple plates, or incorporating some other process in there. Keep it up this is a great start."
printmaking,1yflov,pencilears,2,Thu Feb 20 23:22:38 2014 UTC,"easiest way to fix crooked border problems is to print on large enough paper that you can cut them square to the print.  I don't think this needs color, nothing wrong with keeping life simple."
printmaking,1yflov,ThyHolyPope,2,Sat Feb 22 07:06:56 2014 UTC,"I'll give you the color, but don't use bleed prints (prints that go to the end of the paper), as a crutch. When I discovered bleed prints I was super happy, no longer have to worry about inky edges, finger prints, registration, etc. but now I feel like a lot of times when I see a bleed print, I always wonder if they wanted a boarder less print, or they are just trying to cover up their mistakes/ poor printing."
printmaking,1yflov,pencilears,2,Sat Feb 22 15:07:26 2014 UTC,use big enough paper and you don't have to cut it all the way down to make it square.
printmaking,1yf0lf,austinoneal88,3,Thu Feb 20 05:23:43 2014 UTC,"It looks like your paper is pretty thick, which would be great for intaglio, but not so much for relief (like a lino cut), especially if you're spooning it (not using a press). I would suggest using a thinner, more absorbant Japanese paper to print with. If you want to stay with the thick stuff,  increase your pressure on a press, or spoon the hell out of it. You could probably get away with gooping more ink on, since it looks to be one color, and doesn't have too much fine detail. I would guess, however, that your ink amount is okay.  (But all of this is just a guess from a glance at the picture on my phone, lol)."
printmaking,1yf0lf,big_catalpa,2,Thu Feb 20 05:37:38 2014 UTC,I agree. Also try wetting your paper if your using a thicker printmaking paper.
printmaking,1yf0lf,respectcondor,3,Thu Feb 20 06:14:16 2014 UTC,When you roll the ink onto the linoleum with your brayer does it stay nice and smooth or does it slightly bead up on the surface after about 30- 60 seconds?  If it's the latter you might try giving your block a good cleaning- sometimes I've found very fresh linoleum to have a little bit of residual solvent material in it that slightly repels the ink.  Cleaning it pretty thoroughly with some denatured alcohol can help.

If you don't need a printer, a flat bed scanner will be a better option. If you live near a university and they have a better scanner, ask to use theirs. Canon, HP, Brother, they are all big names.   Personally, I use a Canon one that requires no power source [meaning I can scan anywhere] and an HP all-in-one printer, that I only use the scanner on. I prefer the Canon, but it's ten plus years old and I'm not sure how much more compatibility I'll get out of it."

printmaking,1xg6fn,marcoesquandolas13,2,Sun Feb 9 19:59:47 2014 UTC,I've hung them with magnets too. Just use some sticky tack with a magnet pushed slightly in it the put your print on it and add  magnet to the front of your print if that makes sense?

printmaking,1xg6fn,FF6633,1 point,Mon Feb 10 03:23:35 2014 UTC,One other thing you can do in lieu of framing is to place it against the wall with a pane of acrylic.  The sheet of acrylic should be larger than the print; drill a hole in each of the corners.  Use that as a template for drilling pilot holes into the wall and then use mounting screws.  This is a nice method for rotating work.
printmaking,1xg6fn,leavesinspring,1 point,Mon Feb 10 00:50:22 2014 UTC,"I like to use archival tape by creating tabs. I'm gonna try to describe the best as I can... So depending on the size of the print (the bigger/heavier the print, the longer the tape), cut the tape and fold roughly 1.5 inch of the tape onto itself, creating a 0.75"" tab (adjust according to size), while adhering the rest to the back of your print. Repeat for all four corners (or just two if your print is light enough), and voila! You can use push pins/nails on the tabs instead on the print itself.  Edit: Can't find appropriate images online so I made a mini demo so it may make more sense: http://imgur.com/a/XITFL"
printmaking,1xg6fn,Sharlies,1 point,Mon Feb 10 07:25:59 2014 UTC,"Congrats on a new print! Magnets, binder clips, or tacks on the corners all work well. If you don't want to put holes in the wall, hang binder clips on those tiny 3M command strip hooks.   If the print is not big, another nice solution that looks ""framed"" is clipping it on a clipboard, and hanging the clipboard on the wall. That way, you can easily switch art around, too.  If you have the money to spend on a frame, that will protect it best, of course. American Frame sells reasonably-priced custom frames. If you frame it, be sure to use acid-free backing/matting/etc.   As far as curling goes--run it through a press, weight it down under heavy books for a while. Sometimes you can iron things to flatten them, but don't do this unless you know exactly how it was printed and feel very, very, comfortable in your understanding of how it will react to heat."
printmaking,1xg6fn,LordMonichromicorn,1 point,Mon Feb 10 16:34:55 2014 UTC,It depends on the setting - For in home - Probably Framing - for a Gallery setting I would recommend small magnets on both sides of all four corners though you need to put a nail into the wall first for each magnet to rest on.

I usually work with 3/4"" standard birch plywood, especially if I'm working big. The benefit of plywood is that it's more likely to be even and not warp because it's made up of different layers that can't warp against each other. Avoid any plywood with a paper thin veneer- it will appear to be a lovely piece, but that veneer will chip off while carving, and even while rolling up with a stiff ink. If you have some disposable income, I highly suggest shina plywood, which is manufactured specifically for woodcuts. Good luck!"

As such, placing in a ferric bath will likely cause that flaking simply because the ferric is mixed with water.   You might be able to smoke the plate to harden the ground, but I am unsure of how that would work on a Z-Acryl surface.   If there is no incredibly important reason for you to be using the ""non-toxic"" methods, I would recommend using the standard 'old-timey' methods. Use gloves and a respirator if it is a health concern."

I have only used the film and am more familiar with asphaltum grounds, so take this all with a grain.   Taking it that your plate is clean and degreased and water sheets off the plate. (If the plate is very oxidized it would not hurt to deoxidize.) Apply the ground thinly as possible (as you are).   After it's dried a bit it may be possible to make the application of the ground thinner with a dilute bath of soda ash. I have not tried this with Z-Acryl, only ImageOn, so do a test plate. Put the plate with the dry Z-Acryl in a tray of the solution and rock the tray, don't use a brush to agitate it as it would be too aggressive. The Z-Acryl should start to wash off. When it seems thin enough (but not washed away). Take it out, rinse it with water, and let it dry thoroughly. Use a hairdryer or let it dry 24 hours.   With ImageOn it would be 1 TBS ash to 1 pint hot water. Rock it for 3-5 minutes. Rinse, dry. But as it's a different material, times and amounts would vary.   If you try thinning it with ash, please let me know whether or not it works."

printmaking,1vreda,what_how,8,Tue Jan 21 13:56:05 2014 UTC,"You can look at your cuts a couple of different ways. One being to differentiate areas of different color values (like you did on the tusks and ears!), but also areas of different light values. Right now, this has very little depth to it aside from the tusk/tooth on the other side of the mouth. A few lines inside of the main black area will help convince our eyes that there is light reflecting off of this surface, as well as show us the texture of its fur. Consider establishing a light source. On your drawing, draw an arrow pointing at the boar and tell yourself that this is where the majority of the light is coming from. Everything closer to this line will be lighter (more stuff will be cut away), and everything further from this point will be darker.  Here is a similar print that is a little more dynamic than what you've got going on currently.   Hope that helps, not trying to be too critical, those are tips that I've picked up along the way, thought I'd share :)  edit: typo"

printmaking,1vreda,EMCME,1 point,Tue Jan 21 23:20:36 2014 UTC,"As an added suggestion to that, I would recommend having an edition of the simple one, and then adding more to the block. Not always do people like their additions."
printmaking,1vreda,kevlag,1 point,Wed Jan 22 02:41:19 2014 UTC,"Carving fur can often be daunting and scary, but once you see a few different techniques it can become fun and dynamic.  The v-tool is good for long wavy hair, or short little hairs.  The u-tool can make tube like hair, or rounded scaly hair.  Even a few marks throughout can give that ""layered"" look and make the image really pop!  Simple marks such as an eyelid, or lip, or little hairs in the ear can add a lot and make it your own.  Check out the couple over at www.tugboatprintshop.com.  They are amazing and create really beautiful prints with simple designs.  Good luck and happy printing!"

I used to be strictly an oil painter, then I had to take printmaking for my degree and I fell in love with linocuts and wood cuts.  If you haven't tried wood cuts yet I recomend it. The wood grain adds an extra degree of difficulty and I like the results I get when I do get to do a woodcut. You can also use mdf or medium density fiberboard. It feels like a cross between linoleum and wood. You don't get any fun woodgrain but its still fun to cut on and gives clean results like linoleum does."

I really liked linocuts but it was really killing my hands. After seeing this one video of mdf printing it sure made me interested, since I'm guessing that wood or mdf might not have little bits break off as easily like linoleum does. Is it necessary to use different tools for carving wood/mdf compared to lino? Kind of assuming you do. Do you print quite often?  So what kind of difficulty does the wood grain add? Does it make it tougher to cut/carve?  Btw, this might be sort of related, but Inkodye is something that also seems interesting for printing a design. Edit: Oh yeah and it can print on wood too, so if wood grain is your thing, this might be neat."
printmaking,1vihqr,jenjenpaints,2,Sat Jan 18 17:07:08 2014 UTC,"You would need woodworking tools for woodcuts. You can use lino tools for mdf, but not for long and it will kill your hands worse than just lino printing. Mdf will break off a bit. Not nearly as bad as linoleum. The woodgrain can make your blade move in a way that you may not have expected. Just be sure to cut away from you if you do woodcuts, linocutters hurt, woodworking tools can maim!

Breaking up a print is one thing, breaking up a CMYK print? God speed, and good luck.   Being serious here though, the only way I can think of doing this efficiently would be to break up the print into overlapping sections, do the prints as bleed prints, and hope to god each section lines up perfectly if you put them all on a backing with a fixative or something. That way you can trim off your registration marks. Leaving some gaps could even work aesthetically depending on the image. Even if you got a 3 foot squeegee, a 6 foot pull would be next to impossible to pull off and keep consistent across the entire length without building something to help you get the length, especially considering consistent pressure is really important to keep your values. I really admire your ambition, though!"

Most quick cut/easy cut blocks are more similar to rubber stamps and you shouldn't use them with oil based inks cause they'll eventually dissolve, which is no fun (but you can use them with stamp pads, which is!)."

printmaking,1uzzrv,pencilears,1 point,Sun Jan 12 07:10:45 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback. I was using a spoon as a brayer, so it was hard to gauge how much pressure I was using. Do you think I should invest in a press?"
printmaking,1uzzrv,jenjenpaints,2,Sun Jan 12 17:38:11 2014 UTC,A good press that works can be pretty expensive. I hand press all my projects and depending on the size it can be a bit of a workout to do an edition! I just make sure to change directions when I use a spoon to burnish the print. Work from top to bottom then do another pass from left to right. I press pretty hard while I work. If you are using water based ink you will need to work quickly.
printmaking,1uzzrv,pencilears,1 point,Mon Jan 13 00:53:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the tips! I am using water based ink, and for this first edition, I only made three prints. Glad to know I can continue to use the trusty spoon instead of forking out money for a press."

printmaking,1uzzrv,pencilears,1 point,Mon Jan 13 07:23:07 2014 UTC,"First and foremost, to the OP - I really like the design. Nice flow and clean cuts!  So this may sound like a stupid question, but I'm just starting out and would love some insight on how too much ink plus too little pressure gives this result? As I'm learning more, my initial instinct would have been that the plate might have been slightly underinked to give the vintage kind of feel that this has.  So basically - I'm probably overinking everything I pull."
printmaking,1uzzrv,kevlag,2,Wed Jan 15 20:38:01 2014 UTC,"you get the even clean look from even and steady pressure. underinked and we would have seen a lighter look to the black, or even breyer marks, as it is it's just speckley.   it's a problem I have had with spoon prints, it's really hard to apply the same even pressure you can do with a press. but I've also done this to myself on a press.   the impulse when things are coming out light is to add more ink, but that doesn't solve the pressure problem.  I have no idea why too much ink and not enough pressure gives this result, I just know that it does in my experience."

printmaking,1uoutf,ash_her,1 point,Wed Jan 8 15:33:51 2014 UTC,sitting on them works too. or putting them under your laptop
printmaking,1uoutf,pencilears,3,Thu Jan 9 05:17:37 2014 UTC,"ok, there's a couple of things you can do.  one, it's winter. cold linoleum cuts like crap. heat your linoleum up a bit, not too much, because if you cook it the solvents evaporate out of the plastic and it gets too brittle and will chip horribly, but just enough that it's like cutting in a sharp cheddar cheese. try the low setting of a heating pad.  two, keep your tools sharp. use a strop on the #1 about every 15 minutes and it'll perform much better. at the same time as you're stopping to sharpen your tool, take some time to flex out your hands. (and your back, don't develop a printer's hunch)  three, find a more comfortable grip and switch it up. I don't know how you're holding your tool, but for me there's the classic pencil grip that gives me the writer's callus from hell, and the ever popular meat of the thumb grip that I find works best for a well controlled cut."
printmaking,1uoutf,ThyHolyPope,2,Wed Jan 8 05:55:46 2014 UTC,Thank you for the detailed response. I'll definitely try hearing it. Would a hot water bath work? I've been using the pencil grip and it hasn't seemed to give me a writers callous yet. I'll try switching to the other one though.
printmaking,1uoutf,pencilears,1 point,Wed Jan 8 15:35:44 2014 UTC,"so i've been carving with the same tools as you for the better part of 3 years. and i use the ""meat of the thumb"" that pencilears talks about never have any real issues during short sittings.  I think where the ""meat of the thumb"" tech is better is you can use your arm's strength to move through the linoleum while carving rather then using just your wrist. Just this switch should help.  also with hearing, i've never heated, but i know some people hate carving  in unheated lino for the same reasons as you. honestly i'm not sure about the hot water approach, but i don't think it's your best approach. In this weather, you could try taking advantage of your home or school heater/ heating vents. plenty of ways to jerry rig this, but you could try: putting your lino straight on the vent, put lino in a trash bag (or smaller) and taping the bag opening to the vent, taping some cardboard over the vent at an angle so that it could blow over your lino, etc."
printmaking,1uoutf,bemundolack,1 point,Wed Jan 8 16:59:37 2014 UTC,"hot water might be bad for the burlap, I'd go for a dry heat. if you are at a print shop you might have access to a hot plate, put it on the absolute lowest setting and wait for it to heat up, then put your block on it for a bit to heat up and take it off again to work on it.  if it's a small block, I've had good results overtaxing my laptop's graphic processor and heating it up between my lap and my laptop.  the second grip is definitely how your carving tool is actually meant to be held, it puts the strength of your arm behind your cuts so you don't have to grip as hard to cut deeply. tell me how you like it."

It comes with all the tools you need to get started, although if you want to be more traditional you'll want to get a Hangi To knife as well (this kit has a v-gouge instead). I just bought this set myself because I wanted to start making woodblock prints.   If you can't get a Hangi-To, I've also heard that you can get great results by using disposable razor blades and x-acto knives for the fine lines. You just have to remember to throw blades away regularly (you'll throw away several carving the lines on one block). But I don't think there's a good cheap replacement for chisels and u-gouges. If you don't go the disposable tools route, you'll want to get a honing block to start at least, because woodblock tools dull fast, and you'll want some way to restore the edge while you're carving.   I really like Japanese printmaking myself because of the easy cleanup/lack of solvents needed. Typically Sumi ink is used for blacks. For colors you can use watercolor paint as ink. It works better if they're the kind in the tubes, but you can use the cakes in a pinch, I've heard.  If you have dry pigment, you mix your printing ink as needed."

I have two handles so that I can keep my most used tips in each. The handles also store the tips in the end.   Speed Ball inks work well, but are not as good as those from Daniel Smith and other art suppliers. I use them because they are readily available at most hobby stores.   I prefer an oil based ink over a water based. The only problem is the clean up with oil based ink. You should start with water based inks first.   I print by hand using a baren and rolling pin.   The paper you use will have a big impact on the final print. Get a paper that will readily accept the ink. Not too smooth or too rough. A rice paper is nice but it is too thin for my tastes.   Hope this helps. Please post a print. Cheers."

Whatever you get, make sure you budget for sharpening your tools - something like http://www.woodworkingshop.com/product/pw12/ is good to start with.

printmaking,1tfxym,wespor,1 point,Sun Dec 22 04:49:04 2013 UTC,If anything I'd be worried about it being TOO good! Too much pressure might damage the plates but I'm sure you could figure out a good balance.  But then again I don't know how much pressure regular presses apply other than in terms of arbitrary combinations of letters and numbers.
printmaking,1tfxym,kappanjoe,2,Sun Dec 22 05:01:32 2013 UTC,"It'll be hooked up to an air compressor, I could regulate the pressure with the air pressure valve. I figure there has to be some problem though otherwise more people would be using clickers for printmaking and we'd hear about it, there are a lot of manual clickers around that are much cheaper and even at 3k this is cheaper than competitively sized rolling presses."
printmaking,1tfxym,kappanjoe,2,Sun Dec 22 05:09:51 2013 UTC,"Well I don't know that I'd chalk it up to a problem as much as I would that people just don't know what they even are, and the size might be too limiting for some as well. Also, just based off of the images it seems that it might be difficult to slide both the block and the paper in between the bed/press without them shifting too much?  Anyway, aside from the pressure possibly being too much/too little, I can't tell if there'd be anything else you'd run in to. Good luck, and hopefully you can find someone who actually knows a bit about these machines and how they might be applied to printing!"

printmaking,1t7da0,CircularUniverse,2,Thu Dec 19 04:42:42 2013 UTC,"First step- before you start printing, spray the screen with water, then spread it all around/ into the mesh with your squeegee.  This keeps the screen from absorbing all of the moisture of your inks on impact, which keeps the ink from drying out.  This also keeps the ink from drying to the squeegee side of the screen, as you were describing.  Just have a few test sheets to start the run with, all of the water should dry itself out in just a few test prints, then you are good to go.  I used to have these same exact problems, and printing anything waterbased was a huge anxiety to me, because my two past screen printing teachers never properly trained me how to do it....  However, now I am doing runs of around 1000 without any problems....   Check out the forums on gigposters.com for the best screen printing advice in the world.  I just purchased TW graphics water based retarder..  Same as glycerin, just sold in a gallon container, and not meant to go up your butt.  Works great.  I would recommend using it in addiction with the extender base, simply because the extender is much cheaper than ink, and will stretch out the life of your inks.  However, from my past experience, extender base is not at all necessary, and you can get the correct viscosity and extended-drying-time by just using retarder/glycerin and water.  Don't get the Nazdar, it is only for solvent based ink, which is extremely toxic stuff and mainly used for printing signs, vinyl stickers, and weather resistant stuff."

One tab above the bottom right corner and two tabs on the bottom. Tape those down.   Move the print and tape the outer tabs of the E to the table underneath the middle tab and you've created a perfect slot for your paper to sit exactly right every time. I hope that makes sense.

printmaking,1sw0u0,DRATM,10,Sat Dec 14 21:55:12 2013 UTC,For those who are curious: Ghostbusters Firehouse the building does indeed look exactly like this. So two artists using similar mediums would probably look alike no matter what you do.
printmaking,1sw0u0,SugarSugarBee,4,Sun Dec 15 01:09:17 2013 UTC,"I think the idea of creating a flat, screen print style design for a digital print definitely indicates some sort of ignorance about the aesthetic on their part, and the work has a certain student-level quality that definitely doesn't help rule out the possibility that they copied your idea.   But while it seems like they coulda bit the concept, it looks like they drew theirs from scratch (I overlaid the two in photoshop and the proportions are all different, so it's not just a tracing). Not much you can do but console yourself with the fact that you've got the superior design and the thought that they're unlikely to sell any at twice the price and half the quality ;)  Pop culture related stuff has limited source material to draw from so coming up with something original is kind of an arms race. Add to that, most consumers don't really care so much about who originally came up with a design so much as how clever or stylish it is, so knock-off designs crop up all over. It's just part of that market, IMO."
printmaking,1sw0u0,chrkchrkchrk,3,Sat Dec 14 23:08:12 2013 UTC,it's an orthographic projection of a pop culture reference.  you're not the first nor will they be the last.  /u/DRATM said it best.

I had made this back in the summer and he put his for sale last month. I understand it is a famous building and movie (I was accused of biting off another print that I had never seen until someone posted the link, style wise the two are completely different) and I am hesitant to think that this person went out of their way to copy me, but it just seems too similar. What do you think, and what would you do about it (if anything)?  It does tick me off a bit that he is charging 2.5 times as much for his digital print compared to my screen print, but oh well."
printmaking,1sw0u0,SugarSugarBee,8,Sat Dec 14 21:26:24 2013 UTC,"Unfortunately this vector style is common, and since it's a famous building from a famous movie, it'd be tough to prove he was ripping YOU off. If I were to do a vector illustration of the front of the firehouse, it'd probably looks similar as well. At least enough for people to question if I was ripping you off.  I'd only pursue if other prints come up that are also similar. There are a lot of artists who do similar styles (not just vector/screenprinting art, but in other mediums too) who would look near-identical if they tackled the same subject.  Monitor his page though. If more come up, then I'd question if he is taking photos of your prints into illustrator and going over them with a pent tool and tweaking just enough to make it his own. While that would be shitty, it's still hard to prove and not much can be done, sadly."

printmaking,1stfmu,drinksourbeer18,3,Fri Dec 13 19:57:35 2013 UTC,Process: I first draw the outline and basic shapes on a sheet of plexi glass. Next I etch into the plexi glass using a needle like tool. When the etching portion is complete I ink the plate and run it through a press. I use this alternative method to traditional etching because my high school does not have the equipment/material for the traditional process.
printmaking,1stfmu,ThyHolyPope,3,Fri Dec 13 19:58:30 2013 UTC,"So this is a form of intaglio (although its traditionally done on copper). although etching is one form of creating an intaglio image there are other methods, like drypoint, which is what your doing. etching creates valleys that the ink will go into, where as with drypoint creates valleys with raised burrs on the outside, since your not actually removing material, just displacing it (unlike etching, which actually removes material).   but for doing drypoint intaglio on plexiglass, there are pretty good. does your school have an exposure unit, because if you do you could look into doing ImageOn. which is where do a drawing on a transparency, then expose it to a film that you put on your plexiglass in the exposure unit. It would be a good alternative to look into since you don't have an acid at your disposal."

printmaking,1stfmu,batshitshit,3,Sat Dec 14 18:36:57 2013 UTC,Very resourceful! I love the contrast between the red and blue you used. I've also heard of using cardboard with the slick surface to create an etching. You know like the stuff used for cereal boxes? It might be a tad cheeper. Are you using oil or water based inks?
printmaking,1stfmu,jenjenpaints,2,Fri Dec 13 20:48:22 2013 UTC,"I use mountboard, but I have tons of it laying around after design school. It's stiffer and the outer paper layer peels away nicely. The surface underneath is a bit rough and makes for an alright ""aquatint"", as long as you're not trying to do a really large area with it.  You can try sealing the surface of the cardboard or mountboard to see if it'll last longer (I use gel medium usually), but note that the texture of whatever you seal it with will impact the print (or could fill in the finer details).  Basically, look into collagraphy, it's riiiiight up your alley."

printmaking,1sorbr,aMillee,3,Thu Dec 12 03:14:05 2013 UTC,"I think that heavily depends on what kind of printmaking she's doing, and also how ""very involved"" she's gotten.  I know a lot of people who drop thousands on press equipment that sits there printing nothing, so I will caution against just de facto jumping to ""get a press.""  That said, if she's really serious, then yeah.  I agree with aMillee.  Get a press.  I recommend going antique if you can find the right machine.  A press made in 1890 will be a better piece of machine than anything on the market now for the entry-level press-maker, I can almost guarantee it.  Also, it will be easier to learn how to use, and there's something to be said for the romance of working on a press that old.  Depending what kind of printing work she's doing, the most affordable options right now would probably be a Chandler and Price platen press, most likely a tabletop model (though I've certainly seen 10x15's for much less than I've seen many 6.5x10's...  I've spent a good amount of time hunting down and refurbishing presses for my work, and I can tell you that they are everywhere if you know how to look.  Start by going to local press and print shops and asking if people have a lead on something.  Explain that you're not the printmaker yourself, and don't necessarily know how to a) disassemble, b) ship, c) reassemble, d) restore, e) maintain a press.  Most pressmen have good leads on available presses in the area.  Expect to travel at least a couple of hours if you don't want to pay somebody else to send you the thing.  If you have questions about press purchasing, post them here or PM one of the big printing guys.  We're stupidly amenable to answering questions, usually.  If pressmen weren't, most of us could never have gotten started.  If you are interested in finding a press in your area, check out the directory at Briar Press' website.

Or if she likes screenprinting you could get her a kit, especially if she's just getting started. I would stay away from Speedball inks though, they aren't so great.  If she likes litho you could get her some of the supplies she needs for that.  PM and I can help direct you to some good tools/places to buy printmaking stuff.

Printmaking is a large field which a lot of different mediums with a lot of different tools and equipment for each medium, so unless you know what kind of printmaking she is into its hard to say what to get her. but lets just go with a bunch of random thoughts. A) If shes into relief printing you could get her a nice carving tool set. make sure to get the right tools though, linoleum tools if she likes lino, and wood tools if she likes wood. B) If you you live in a major city, look into if there are any print shops/ co-ops that offer classes. that could be a fun gift/ date opportunity C) its no question that printmakers get dirty, so a great idea would be a personalized apron, maybe put some of her art of or get her name on it, idk. D) make an assorted printmakers gift basket with brayers, ink, pallet knife, grease pencils, etc. E) does she like any printmakers, if so get her a print by that person, get it framed, and VOILA."

printmaking,1skt6q,davidjb,2,Sun Jan 5 05:53:18 2014 UTC,"Sure!  It's a long process from taking the photo. But essentially through photoshop I change the image into a grayscale > duotone, and in the color picker, choose a third color. This makes it a tritone. The fun part here is just picking three colours that I like and that work well with the image. I picked a darker blue for the shadows, a sky blue for the highlights and a yellow to green things out a bit and as a sort of middle tone.  Once I pick my colours and mess around with the levels a bit, I get it printed onto acetate in black and white to prepare it for exposure and screenprinting. I will then have ink pre-mixed and hand pull each print like a normal screenprint.   When they're all layered on top of each other you get the effect of the full bodied image looking straight on, and then a bit of a separation when you move around it, revealing the individual layers."

printmaking,1sj0xj,bowlss,3,Tue Dec 10 07:59:07 2013 UTC,Aside from coloring your lips? I don't do intalgio printmaking but I'm guessing that OP wants to use the lipstick as soft ground. Soft ground is basically a layer you apply to a plate that you then scratch through.
printmaking,1sj0xj,Drpepperisbetter,3,Tue Dec 10 14:01:39 2013 UTC,That description could be hard ground too. The thing with soft ground is it stays soft long enough to pick up texture from a dry run through the press with material over it. This let's you add allover patterning without having to make a line etch of every detail
printmaking,1sj0xj,bauhauskeeping,2,Tue Dec 10 18:14:36 2013 UTC,"It's pretty amazing, you can apply a soft ground (any sort of acid resistant ground that doesn't harden, often made from asphaltum and beeswax) to your entire copper or zinc plate.  A hotplate and brayer will help you distribute the ground evenly.  If you place the plate directly in acid the ground protects it and nothing gets etched.  However, if you press different materials into it like cheesecloth or cardboard prior to etching then the metal is exposed in those places and can be etched. Use wax paper to protect areas where you don't want the ground to lift off."

printmaking,1rmvda,Sackcloth,11,Thu Nov 28 08:13:49 2013 UTC,"Well its sounds like your set to carve out a block, if you are planning to print at home all you need now is inking and cleaning materials.  Inking:  Ink!! of course, get some oil based relief ink from your local art store or go to http://www.imcclains.com/ or http://www.imcclains.com/ for all your printmaking needs  Brayer; To apply the ink (don't get speedball they suck)  Sheet of glass; to roll out and mix your inks (any smooth hard surface that you don't mind getting inky will also work like a marble or granite slab)   Paper; Kind of obvious, but get some good rag paper, arches or rives are my go to paper, or if you want to be fancy use some nice japanese paper  Barren; you can buy one specifically for printmaking but the cheap way is just to use the back side of a wooden spoon. This is for smoothly pressing the paper against the inky block to get an even tone.  Clean up: (every one forgets to mention this one but its important for preserving your tools)  Razor blade; this does half of the cleaning for you, use it to scrape up left over ink on your glass slab this will save you hours of wiping up sticky ink  Corn oil; (for the non-toxic clean up) use this to make it easier to wipe up the rest of your ink on your brayer and sheet of glass.  De-greaser; if you leave the corn oil on your brayer and glass you wont be able to get a even roll of ink next time you roll up so it is important to remove it with something like simple green."
printmaking,1rmvda,GnomeRobot,4,Thu Nov 28 08:43:30 2013 UTC,"In addition to what GnomeRobot has shared, there are water based inks that don't require the additional cleaning materials. It's great for first time lino printers to work with."
printmaking,1rmvda,boxcaradventure,3,Thu Nov 28 09:43:28 2013 UTC,"I print at home on the cheap. Oil based ink is slightly more expensive, but if you cheap out on the paper or don't do a good job of inking the plate evenly it will hide a multitude of sins.  I've printed on watercolor paper and gotten nice, crisp, prints with oil ink. If you have a thicker paper just soak it in water for a few minutes to loosen the fibers.  When you hand press your print, a burin helps, but I've gotten just as good results with a wooden spoon. The key is to press evenly ALL over the plate. Its easy to miss a spot so be aware of that.  For cleanup don't worry about using a special oil. I just use cheap cooking oil, soap and water, and then really watered down vinigar last."
printmaking,1rmvda,jenjenpaints,2,Thu Nov 28 15:21:16 2013 UTC,"If you use speedball ink, Windex works well for clean up.

I'd recommend, however: A tube of ink meant for relief printing, a brayer to apply the ink evenly, and something (paper, cloth, etc) to print on. You'll need an area to roll the ink out on, as well—I use a scrap of plexiglass, but anything like that would work—and either a wooden spoon or a baren to help get even pressure when pulling the prints (though I've definitely had blocks that worked better printing with pressure from my fingertips...)"

printmaking,1rb0t8,Cadogan102,1 point,Sat Nov 23 20:35:05 2013 UTC,"Background: I have 4 years of traditional art studies but in the last two years we were really encouraged to think outside the box and explore contemporary art practice. I did a small project as a private aside to explore animation and stop motion, I really liked the results and started to explore it more and more. My original inspirations for getting into this kind of work were Muybridge's locomotion series, when I saw a William Kentridge animation at a local gallery I realised there was potential behind combining traditional media and new media.  The video in the link was a major work I submitted to my graduation exhibition. It took me about a year to finish from concept, through production and editing to finish. I mostly used mono-typing techniques to produce the imagery, although I also used lino-cuts to make cut-outs which I then pinned to a piece of foam board and photograph.  I am also an avid explorer of digital media, and so included digital animations and drawings/paintings in my work.  The fluid backgrounds is a water colour piece I created specifically for the project, the original colours (mostly greens and blues) were changed in photoshop as needed (mostly to reds and oranges).  The sounds were all recorded and edited by me. They are original recordings of bubble-wrap and tinfoil. I wanted minimal but meaningful sound, I did this because I was not confident in my sound recording and editing skills but also because I wanted to improve them."

Also glossy photo paper is not the best substrate to use for hand printing, especially as a beginner. If you need to be especially cheap, bristol board will do the trick.  How are you applying pressure? With a press? A spoon a baren? How are you applying ink to your matrix? Are you using a brayer and is it hard or soft? Are you using a dauber?  As far as using caligraphy ink...why? What is the humidity like? How old is it?"
printmaking,1qcvd9,LauraGrossett,1 point,Thu Nov 14 05:16:02 2013 UTC,"There are a couple problems here. First is the glossy photo paper.  This is nonabsorbent.  I would encourage you to use Mulberry or rice paper.  These are perfectly designed for relief prints.  Another paper that works nicely is Rives Lightweight.  Check Dick Blick, Takach or Graphic Chemical.  Secondly, if you are using the ink I think you are it is the wrong sort. Calligraphy ink is not printmaking ink.  It is designed to flow through a pen nib.  You want something with body. I have not been impressed by speedball but it might be a good choice for a beginner because it cleans up with water.  I recommend Daniel Smith Relief ink (this can be found on the Daniel Smith website).  Apply it using a brayer (a small roller) and clean up with mineral spirits (you can buy this at the hardware store).  There are fancier inks out there but Daniel Smith is a good place to start.  You can use it straight from the can without modifying it."
printmaking,1q6wox,crumpsticks,3,Fri Nov 8 18:18:24 2013 UTC,"It is always somewhat of an exercise to diagnose printing problems in person, and more so when trying to do it remotely like this and with limited information as to your methods as i don't know your backround at all but I have a few suggestions.  They are kind of the standard fair of basic checks but it may give you some things to try. You said you have a new roller, so a damaged or nicked roller surface is probably not the issue, you need a soft rubber brayer for lino, there is a small chance your roller is too hard. It appears you have a few spots with solid blacks scattered in there, which is kind of promising.  It sounds like you are probably printing this at home, so your issue may be from not providing enough, and consistently even, pressure when you are hand rubbing the print. Try a few prints with exaggerated pressure, make sure you are making multiple passes throughout and are keeping the pressure even and see if this yields different result. If you are using a press, try orienting the plate differently, ie, rotating it 90 or 180 degrees. Further, you may be under-inking the plate.  As I said, im not really sure what inks you are using, but inks very greatly in their temperament.  Make sure you are warming up the ink before printing. Atmosphere and temperature will affect the consistency of your ink and its tack and length and warming it up will generally help if you are getting a salty image like this. Take your knife and work the ink repeatedly folding and spreading the ink for a couple minutes before rolling it out on your surface and ultimately rolling it onto your plate. Then do some prints. Then I'd try to over-ink the plate. You may simply not be getting enough ink onto the printing surface, so go overboard, more than you think and see what happens and then work back from there. Also, using a higher quality paper will always pull better prints so look into that. There is always the possibility that any number of things have compromised the surface of your lino, seeing as it is a salvage piece, but printing several impressions should help to normalize the plate. you may try using a solvent to clean the plate and start over again. worst come to it, you'll have to make a new plate. Anyhow, just keep printing aways, try changing one thing at a time to determine the root of the issue. It is probably a combination of several little things but i'd start with inking and pressure.  Good luck."
printmaking,1q6wox,print_maker,1 point,Fri Nov 8 19:02:50 2013 UTC,"Crikey. Ok, I have a few things to think about.   The ink i'm using isn't like the thick oil based inks I used at uni. Comes out more like acrylic paint.   I'd completely forgotten about warming up ink with the palette knife. Is it as important with waterbased?   I used sharpie to draw onto the lino originally. I noticed that the white sharpie always shows through no matter how much ink I use. So I might try some white spirit on it.   Pressure wise I'm using a large heavy book for initial even weight. And hand rubbing to make sure. I'm not exactly strong though.   Paper I'm using 90gsm copy paper for tests. Guessing that might be a contributing factor. Planning on printing on 100% recycled manila card. Is this wise?   The frustrating thing is that other plates have been coming out fine. I'd hate to have to recut it.  Thanks so much for bothering to write all that out. :) lots to try out in the morning!"
printmaking,1q6wox,doublen00b,2,Fri Nov 8 19:22:19 2013 UTC,If I had to guess based on this I think it has to do with the acrylic ink. Acrylic ink dries much faster than oil based inks.   The older linos have soaked up some of the oil from previous prints so the acrylic ink doesn't dry on the surface of the linoleum. The newer linoleum is still porous so the ink can dry from the linoleum side and from the exposed side.   Spreading the ink with a roller leaves a very thin layer of ink and in winter when it isn't as humid it dries very quickly (on both sides in your case) and leaves a patchy result.
printmaking,1q6wox,print_maker,2,Fri Nov 8 20:03:34 2013 UTC,"Ah yes, I had overlooked the part where you said you are using water based ink.  The warming up is really an oil based thing and rolling it (water based inks) out for too long can actually make them dry out. with water based you really just need to be sure it is mixed well but if you are using the same ink for your other prints then its probably fine.  it should appear even as it runs off the knife, without big gaps or holes  in the ribbon if its mixed well. Using copier paper is definitely not the best lol but it shouldnt be the end of the world while you are doing your early proofs. If you are using it to proof your other plates and not getting the same problems in proofing then you know this is not from the paper alone. As you get closer to printing your edition you will want to use a better paper and one closer to your final printing paper.  I have no idea about the manilla card so I'll be no help there I'm afraid but give it a try and you'll find out. The white sharpie is likely a contributing factor as it should definitely not be on there while you are printing. Not sure if you mean showing through, as in it varies the print where the mark is on the plate, or if it is actually offsetting onto the paper but either way you should clean your plate with acetone to remove all of your working marks before printing. I'd start there.  Having a surface free of all foreign materials is the most important place to begin.Take a close look at your plate before and after cleaning. use a loop if you have one.  Damp it and play the light off of the surface.  You want the surface to all look uniform and flat. If you spot any inconsistencies, weird shine or places where the water is pulling away from you have some junk on the surface and should clean it again. Also sometimes you can see webbing patterns on a damp plate and this can indicate the plate is aged or damaged and irregular and might mean its not usable anymore. Honestly, I really never do lino personally and havent made a lioncut of my own in probably 8-9 years. I do intaglio predominately so my actual working knowledge of it is limited and this is just what i remember from helping students around the shop and kind of general printmaking pointers.  Apologies for the wall of text. I type real fast.   edit: some stuffs for clarity"
printmaking,1q6wox,print_maker,1 point,Fri Nov 8 20:16:31 2013 UTC,"Thanks, you've been incredibly helpful for someone who it isn't even their specialty!   I don't think the ink is drying out, it seems high quality, it is a tad thin, like i said, a bit more like acrylic paint, but it doesn't dry as rough as acrylic does. when ever i wet the plate the water forms into tiny balls on the surface, so i think it might be some kind of waterproofing layer?  This could be the reason why my old haggered - been through the press a thousand times plates are printing fine - that surface has worn off. or i put it on with the sharpies.   So i tried a little more last night, i whacked out the white spirit (dont have any acetone lying around not even nail polish remover) this got rid of all the white marker, and some of the other layers, but yeh. Man do i regret that.   Anyway, It has helped, i scrubbed it with a tooth brush and used more fairy washing up liquid to de-grease it a bit, and there are obvious improvements.   Over inking it has helped a bit, but some of the negative space is printing as well now.   Last resort will be taking v.fine sand paper to the plate as it seems to be an extreme of what i've been doing with the toothbrush.  I've added some more images including the plate http://imgur.com/a/EmfNs"
printmaking,1q6wox,printmakingthings,1 point,Sat Nov 9 11:05:21 2013 UTC,"Glad I was able to help at all.  The layer you are talking about may just be grease on the plate, or it might be deliberate a part of the plate, maybe the plate you are using is suited for oil based inks, i dunno, this is where my knowledge of lino runs out.  I have no idea about sanding the plate either. I'd advise trying that out on a scrap of the same plate you cut that from if you have one before doing it on your plate. You'll have to find the right balance for inking just enough but making sure you dont start getting fill-in on the fine details. Otherwise that is a definite improvement in that last print though so keep working at it.  You should really look into getting some better paper if that is how it looks on copy paper. A heavier printmaking paper or watercolor paper'd be a good place to start.  It will really make a huge difference and might pull enough ink off the plate to get those last blacks.  Anyhow, keep at it."

printmaking,1q1fbu,Eljoshyo,3,Wed Nov 6 18:02:43 2013 UTC,"What you're seeing is dot gain, caused by the ink sinking into the paper. You can: 1. Stick with an inkjet printer and experiment with paper types. Coated papers will experience less dot gain, but require a much longer drying time (possibly even requiring heat to dry entirely). 2. Tweak your design to accommodate for the dot gain. Make the details larger, or carefully alter the design to use the dot gain to your advantage. 3. Try a laser printer; the toner is not susceptible to dot gain.  You can try to work with an offset (lithography) printer, but it's unlikely they'll do it as a one-off and charge as such (most commercial printers have minimum orders and set up fees for a reason.)"

printmaking,1q1fbu,batshitshit,1 point,Wed Nov 6 23:10:00 2013 UTC,"Unfortunately, I've never worked on anything on such a small scale that dot gain was a concern, it's just something you learn about in design schools (especially those that are more print-oriented). I don't really know what specs to look for, and can only recommend research and experimentation at this point. I'd particularly see if there's a way to research the ink output of each printer and if they report the minimum area.  Another consideration, now that I think of it: The small details, are they color? Are they anything but 100% cyan, 100% magenta, 100% yellow, or 100% black? If they are, I'd recommend changing them to one of the above and seeing if that addresses the problem. Printers operate in the CMYK colorspace, and any colors beyond cyan, magenta, yellow, and black are achieved by mixing those four colors (some printers do have more ink colors, but the principle is the same). They way this is handled is by overlaying small dots of ink, so the details could be getting fuzzy if the area is anything but a single pure ink color."

I say this because the birthmother figure in the center is quite unrealistically posed if we assume her to have roughly human proportions. find and use a reference photo of a woman giving birth. also, I am distracted by her apparent 6pack abs, and it looks like the feet, which frame your focal point, were clumsily omitted because, like hands, they are hard to draw.  is she supposed to be emitting an endless stream of consumer goods? or just a mangled aborted fetus? those two things convey vastly different messages when combined with your text. what exactly do you want to say?  the hole in the floor appears both unreal and insubstantial. did you mean for it to be made of the same stuff as the floor? why not an industrial looking pipe? or a hole in the floor itself?   also, if the only text in your piece is a short three word phrase, consider omitting it and using it as your title instead. this saves the trouble of properly kerning backwards text as you draw it, and gives the picture a greater sense of stillness.

printmaking,1pmerd,listenana,4,Thu Oct 31 22:40:33 2013 UTC,"MDF! It cuts well, and is very cheap. I usually go to home depot and check out the wood scrap pile... sometimes there is scrap mdf in there that is cheap/free."
printmaking,1pmerd,peteiscool1,3,Fri Nov 1 04:16:14 2013 UTC,"PVC works for smaller editions because it can be cut, but doesn't hold up as well as either wood or linoleum over periods of time. (It gets crushed down by the pressure after a while) as for anything else, What I do for my wood blocks is I go around and search near construction sites, or since you're still in school, around the facilities offices/loading docks. You can find lots of wood that people throw out that is awesome for carving."

printmaking,1pmerd,listenana,1 point,Thu Oct 31 22:39:30 2013 UTC,I'm not super experienced with PVC but it is my inclination to state that it will wear down the sharpness of your tools faster than wood or lino.

I place the paper over the top and use other the palm of my hand or a spoon or something to rub the paper. Sometimes there are inconsistencies which I don't mind but some people don't like it. Also it depends on what ink you use.

printmaking,1oqrp1,Gu3,4,Fri Oct 18 22:14:13 2013 UTC,"Your art and images are the most important aspect of your application.  Professors won't look at anything else in the first round, so make sure you represent yourself and work in professional way.  Make sure you show your strongest work.  Most apps require 15 - 20 images.  Ideally you should have 30 to 40 works to choose from.  I also think it's important to have some consistency in the work as well.  I would suggest showing 1 or 2 bodies of work at most. This shows that you are committed and have something to say as an artist.  In other words don't put anything in your portfolio that you wouldn't show in a gallery.   Your undergrad profs are great references as they know your work and attitude the best and should be more than happy to write a letter for you.  Ask them questions about the application process as well.  I applied and was accepted showing only intaglio prints, so don't fret about that.  It shows your passion and commitment.  I ended up doing everything but intaglio.  It's natural to try new media and experiment in grad school  You'll also have plenty of time in grad school to work on an artist statement.  I don't know of anyone who's been accepted on the merits of an arbitrary, buzzword filled statement about their work.     One last bit of advice, apply to at least 10 schools.  If you don't  get accepted this year, you'll know the process and be confident the next go around.   If you get in to more than one, then go to the one that offers you the most money.   Hope that helps, let me know if you have any more questions."

printmaking,1ohcxk,advanced_relief,3,Tue Oct 15 15:43:02 2013 UTC,"You should ask yourself, why do I want to go to grad school?  Do you want to teach?  Learn new techniques? Or just have to time to focus on your studio practice? Unless you want to teach you might want to consider some other options and save yourself a lot of money.  If you want time to work on your work, take the money you'd spend for grad school, move to a city,  get a part time job, get a studio, make art, meet people, and go every gallery opening.    If you want to learn some new techniques do as I suggested above but also look for a local printshop and get an internship, volunteer or just hangout there.  Printmaking was the first social network and most of the printmakers I know love to talk shop and are more than happy to share techniques.  This is especially true of screen-printing.  Almost every city or town of any significance is going to have a screen shop.  If you really have your heart set on going, apply to at least 10 schools and then go visit those schools and find a place that works for you.  It's hard to get a feel for place from a website.  When you visit a program you can meet the faculty and have a beer with current grads.  This will give you an idea about the attitudes and ego's you'll run into.  If a place has a high ranking but makes you uncomfortable, is it really worth 2 or 3 years of your life and $60,000?  I went to a highly ranked program at a large research institution.  Schools like this often times have great equipment and prestigious faculty who will be busy conducting their own ""research"".  You'll probably only see them 3 or 4 times a semester.  You'll learn more from your classmates than from the faculty and No one is going to care more about your art than you.  One last bit of advice...If you decide to go, have a plan or strategy for your time there.  For example, working on a particular body of work that you couldn't make anywhere else or learning a specific technique that you couldn't learn anywhere else.  Stick to your plan and execute.  Grad school for art is the easiest hardest thing you can do but if you have a mission it's easier to succeed.  That's my two cents, hope it helps."

I don't know what that means to you but Goltzius's chiaroscuro woodcuts were farther down the same path stylistically.

printmaking,1odhcg,legalizethebeat,2,Mon Oct 14 03:31:43 2013 UTC,"You certainly possess a fair degree of carving and printing ability; and as someone else here has said, your colors and compositions are nice.  For some constructive criticism: I would encourage you to try rendering each skull without the solid white outline.  I don't know where you are with school and/or your career, but I do know that one very often sees such outlines in introductory relief classes.  I'd be happy to elaborate on why I think that is if you'd like me to, but in a nutshell it's that carving an outline first makes it easier to develop the rest of the form's value structure; accordingly, such outlines suggest to me a lack of confidence in your handling of the media.  If you did not carve the outlines first, but rather added them after carving the rest of each skull: you don't need to not do that, you just should figure out how to make more clear to your viewer that such is the case: that the outlines are a stylistic device (perhaps much as Egon Schiele's were, in some of his paintings), and that you aren't just unsure how to begin carving value directly."
printmaking,1oe3px,vultures8,3,Mon Oct 14 00:25:23 2013 UTC,You've got to figure out what works best for you.  One way to go about it would be to use a sharpie to get your key lines and cross hatching established and carve out the negative space.  Start small and keep expectations reasonable.  As your confidence in with the tools and the medium grows so will your imagery.
printmaking,1oe3px,advanced_relief,1 point,Mon Oct 14 00:59:33 2013 UTC,"I usually transfer my drawing to the block using transfer paper or iron oxide and tracing paper. Fill in your black areas with sharpie and define some of the bolder lines.   You can cut around your lines with an exacto knife to get sharp edges. Play around with the medium until you're really comfortable. Unfortunately relief doesn't lend itself well to shading as its a high contrast process, but I've found that really focusing on leaving enough black and not carving away too much can help.   Good luck!"
printmaking,1oe3px,Forestfeet,1 point,Mon Oct 14 22:22:12 2013 UTC,"so i'm weird how i carve, but basically what i do is sketch out what i want want to general idea/outline print to look like with a lighter warm colored pencil. i then go on top of that with a darker cooler colored pencil which is more detailed/ better looking then the warm one. so at this point its just linoleum and colored pencil, then i start carving away the white areas. after carving away for awhile, and i want to see what i've done, i take a magnum sharpie and go over that area, most of the time that bleeds into the carved areas, so i take a piece of white chalk, and run it over that area. then gently brush off the surface with my palm a couple times and you can see what you've done."

printmaking,1o5q9w,WiwiJumbo,8,Thu Oct 10 17:43:26 2013 UTC,If you are printing this by hand you will have much better luck printing with a Japanese paper like mulberry.  Eastern papers are lighter weight and much thinner.  Western rag paper is too thick to get a very good impression without a press.  You'll also want to place a piece of newsprint between your printing paper and your barren to help guard against rubbing through the thinner paper  .  I would also suggest loosening up the ink a bit with some 00 oil.  Do some proofs on newsprint first. to get a good feel for it.
printmaking,1o5q9w,advanced_relief,1 point,Thu Oct 10 19:38:30 2013 UTC,"That would probably be a good idea.  I've never done anything like this before and got the whole idea to try from David Bull's YouTube channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/seseragistudio  And that's pretty much all I know about it.  The ink did feel ""thick"" to me, but I thought that's what the roller was for.  Should ""00 oil"" be what I'm looking for, or is there a brand name?  Oh, and when you say newsprint, do you literally mean sheets of newspaper?"
printmaking,1o5q9w,tmfythandle,2,Thu Oct 10 21:56:19 2013 UTC,"newsprint is what newspaper is printed on, but you want blank paper. The ink may rub off and leave the back of your print dirty; if your paper is thin you would not want smudges showing through. Also the ink should ""warm up"" as you roll it. It will be slightly less viscous and a little more manipulable. I also agree with some other comments that you may not have enough ink, the wrong paper, or not enough pressure (don't be afraid to put your whole body into it- I've had larger blocks printed by bulldozer)."

Sounds a little overboard and I'd be a little nervous for the woodblock, but might be worth a try on a crummy print first."
printmaking,1o5q9w,leavesinspring,2,Thu Oct 10 23:26:39 2013 UTC,"Could be one of three things. Not enough ink, not enough pressure, or the paper. It's difficult to say without watching you print, to be honest, but I'd bet on it being from cheap laser paper. Laser paper is designed to take toner, not ink. Try printing with three layers of newsprint at a time. This allows a good emboss with a lower probability of ripping through the paper. If you get a good emboss, but the paper doesn't rip, it's the right pressure, and it should take the ink properly. If it's still too light, then you know it's because there's not enough ink. Make sure you're reapplying ink to the brayer frequently."
printmaking,1o5q9w,PanicAttackBarbie,1 point,Thu Oct 10 18:47:38 2013 UTC,"How much pressure should I be trying?  Like, pressing on it with my hands.  Standing on it?  It seems to be a softish wood and I'm afraid of breaking pieces off.  After doing this one, I'd prefer to use a harder wood in the future.  I think it would be ""cleaner"" to cut."
printmaking,1o5q9w,szimmer6272,3,Thu Oct 10 22:04:24 2013 UTC,"Well, you don't need to be pressing on it so much as rubbing it, if you're printing it by hand. Add some newsprint, make sure you have enough ink, and then take a spoon and use the back of it to rub all the inked areas evenly, with firm (but not like, standing on it) pressure--as demonstrated here, for example.   David Bull is using a different printing technique than you are; look up oil-based printing tutorials rather than ukiyo-e printing. Also look into getting better paper, experiment with lots of kinds of paper."

printmaking,1nncs0,happybluebox,1 point,Thu Oct 3 18:25:32 2013 UTC,"There are lots of resources online on building a two color press, exposure unit, etc.   You definitely need to have access to running water, preferably a utility sink. It's nice to have one with a sprayer for washing out screens too. A sink and a big tub may suffice. You just don't want to try and work on screens in a bathroom sink.   You'll need ink. For working at home and being a beginner, I'd suggest getting water based ink. It's easy to clean up.  The beauty of screen printing is you can print on pretty much anything... But you will need some kind of substrate, obviously.   A big work table and an exposure box are pretty essential. Maybe a small cabinet to keep all your shit in and a clean area for cutting paper or setting shirts."
printmaking,1nncs0,Forestfeet,1 point,Sat Oct 5 00:06:09 2013 UTC,Another thing--   I don't actually have an exposure unit. I use a 500 wat halogen work light and expose speedball emulsion for 40 minutes. I do this in the bathroom.

printmaking,1n18ac,lick_spoons,1 point,Wed Sep 25 05:03:14 2013 UTC,So one of your prints was just a red square? Why not just use red paper? Am I missing something?
printmaking,1n18ac,klilly5,1 point,Fri Sep 27 06:00:06 2013 UTC,"A few reasons. Besides it being difficult to track down red paper that is the exact color that I would want to print on, it would not be cost effective. Also, I would then need to print a white border (harder than printing red on white). It is also not difficult to set a screen with a square on it and I intend to use the same site for my next project. I also tend to change my mind about colors often when I am working, my original test run on these prints I was using a navy blue on a sea foam green.  Tldr: versatility."

I even do this for intaglio.  Edit: Just remember, don't forget to either design it in reverse from the get go, or print it in reverse."

printmaking,1mnigy,kappanjoe,1 point,Wed Sep 18 17:32:20 2013 UTC,"Well for relief blocks I personally use Illustrator designing from scratch. But if you want to do Photoshop your approach depends on a couple things, mainly being what style you want the end result to be, and how many colors/layers you intend on printing.  If you're looking to do a straightforward two-tone image, you can usually just use the Threshold or Posterize effects and get the results you want. If you want to do multiple layers, I believe you can use the Posterize (or a similar) filter to block the image out into multiple colors and trace each of those colors to their respective blocks. A quick google search for these terms will probably yield tutorials that explain it much better than I can. :)"
printmaking,1mnigy,metaphorever,2,Wed Sep 18 18:45:01 2013 UTC,"I've done this with woodcuts before and I think the same process would be applicable. What I did was finalize my design on the computer and then print it onto some full sheet label paper which you can buy at most office supply stores. Stick the label onto your surface and cut away the areas you've marked. Then peel up the remnants of the sticker and use acetone or some other solvent to get rid of any bits that are still stuck. The solvent may stain your linoleum but it should still print the same.  There are other ways to do it, like kappanjoe suggests, which allow for more of you 'hand' to come through, but this was the simplest for me because it's pretty fool-proof and uses stuff you can buy easily even if you don't have an art/print shop nearby.  As far as 'respect' I think it's important to remember that there are many aspects of printmaking that are important beyond the initial creation of the image. You will still be making the actual marks by hand and the decisions you make about line, shading, etc will be your own even if you are working from a computer generated image. The quality of the print, evenness of the ink, registration, cleanness of the print are all technical factors by which prints are judged that have nothing to do with the original image source."
printmaking,1meo4u,bananabilector,2,Sun Sep 15 00:45:18 2013 UTC,"Your plan sounds good to me, my only suggestion is to make a firm schedule. Set a minimum number of cards to design per day/week/whatever you have time for and stick to it. While you're getting them cut use the off time to get organized in the studio. Cut your paper down, prepare proofing sheets, make sure you have designated clean and inky areas. Make sure you have enough supplies to complete the whole run. When you get the blocks back, set a schedule for printing similar to designing. The biggest hurdle with big projects is, I think, burning out or running out of stuff and never picking it up again. I'd say set a firm deadline on the whole thing and plan a really good victory reward to keep yourself motivated. Good luck, post pictures when you're done!"
printmaking,1meo4u,bananabilector,1 point,Sun Sep 15 03:02:14 2013 UTC,"Thank you, this is all brilliant advice, that's how I usually organise myself.

printmaking,1meo4u,bananabilector,1 point,Sun Sep 15 03:09:52 2013 UTC,"Ahhhh, collaboration. It always sound so good in theory, but it's such a challenge. Maybe schedule regular meetings?

printmaking,1mcoef,MrCrusoe,1 point,Sat Sep 14 06:39:39 2013 UTC,"Thanks for sharing the plates!  Looking at the actual print, I was almost sure there were more than one color in the sharpened end of the pencil. But upon inspecting the separated colors there were no such thing! ;-)  I was pretty much convinced that you could only use 100% color in letterprss, but looking at the edge of the scissors it looks as if there is a lighter tone there?  Is there a limit to how thin lines can be? Those curly strokes look mighty thin..."
printmaking,1mcoef,Forestfeet,2,Sat Sep 14 20:31:49 2013 UTC,"Lines can be super thin, but since the plates take such an impression, printers generally try and keep single lines larger than .25pt. In greater groups, though, you can have much smaller shapes like where I've half-toned something with dots and lines (ex: sumi ink bottle, sharpie, scissor blade) because there's more support at the base of the shapes to keep them from dying throughout a run. Letterpress is basically an offset/relief hybrid that's capable of both photographic prints and ultra simple lines and shapes."

printmaking,1m2l9n,killcrash,2,Tue Sep 10 05:39:49 2013 UTC,"Same here. This is how I was taught, and it seems to me that it's much safer too. Doesn't take too much longer to etch, either."
printmaking,1m2l9n,kappanjoe,2,Tue Sep 10 16:37:59 2013 UTC,Me too. I feel like copper and ferric yield the best and most consistent results.
printmaking,1m2l9n,Forestfeet,1 point,Tue Sep 10 21:27:20 2013 UTC,You could use copper plates and nitric. Probably a bit more expensive though. For me it worked a lot better though.
printmaking,1m2l9n,modernalchemist,1 point,Tue Sep 10 02:41:01 2013 UTC,"At my school we used nitric, and it forms bubbles that can remain on the surface of the plate and produce an uneven bite. Does the hydrochloric reaction have a similar effect? If so, you can use a feather to gently remove those bubbles, as you would with nitric acid. Or, if the acid results in sediment settling in your etching lines, you may need a vertical tank and a bubbler to agitate the sediment (the copper/ferric method often uses this). Again, not familiar with hydrochloric acid, so these are pretty wild guesses. Sorry if that's useless.  You've used a wide range of acid strengths (1/1 sounds like more than enough), so I don't think that's the problem either. Beside that, there could be some variation with your technique before etching. Maybe you've de-greased some plates better than others, or you did a better job of removing ground from your lines with certain plates, etc.   As others have suggested, copper plates and ferric chloride is highly recommended as another alternative."
printmaking,1m2l9n,queerMTFchicago,1 point,Tue Sep 10 23:41:52 2013 UTC,"I would highly recommend against using a hydrochloric (Dutch Mordant) setup unless you have all the proper safety equipment (constant ventilation system, eye wash and shower, proper tanks and sinks, etc). When I was in grad school I tried my hand at setting up a Dutch Mordant bath and it was a small nightmare... The ferric chloride setup, despite the vertical tanks typically used, is really the ideal way to etch plates these days."

printmaking,1l4mco,Forestfeet,2,Tue Aug 27 08:31:39 2013 UTC,This is really nice! The text is done well and looks relatively consistent.  I'm not sure if this is a proof or a final print but I would suggest inking more consistently to get sharper results. Hand rubbing can be tough though.   What kind of ink and paper are you using?
printmaking,1l4mco,Forestfeet,1 point,Wed Aug 28 18:13:18 2013 UTC,"Thanks!  I sort of grabbed whatever was around me and printed on it out of excitement that it was finally finished.  First print was on a pizza box.  Second (the photo posted) was on some tracing paper I had laying near by.  I think the texture in this print is actually some residual cardboard texture from the pizza box...haha so yeah definitely just a proof. I actually make paper that I like to print on, seems to work well.  I've been using speedball water soluble ink and am fairly happy with how things turn out."
printmaking,1l4mco,stuciferthemighty,2,Wed Aug 28 18:35:03 2013 UTC,"Cool! I think that this print would look super neat on cloth, like a rough spun canvas. Then you could use it as a patch, etc.   Have you ever tried oil based relief ink? It's a little messier to clean up but it comes out a lot richer and I've found it can be more consistent/go on smoother."
printmaking,1kvxoq,readinginbed,6,Thu Aug 22 17:36:36 2013 UTC,"I'm not sure it's in the best interests of the press to try this. Vandercooks are made to transfer ink from the face of the block to paper with as little pressure as possible, whereas intaglio printing needs lots of pressure to force the damp paper into the etched plate. You risk damaging the press by using too much pressure. If you do end up trying it you're going to need to add lots of packing materials to the drum to really for the force the paper into the grooves of the plate. Post an update with your results if you do end up playing with it, but as I stated before, I wouldn't try it unless you're ok with potentially ruining your press."
printmaking,1kvxoq,dudebauer,3,Thu Aug 22 23:19:28 2013 UTC,"Why, he isn't printing an intaglio.  He is printing a relief print using and etched print.  If the ink is block print ink, and he is just rolling it on top with out worrying about inking the lines, how is this different from printing any other block surface?"
printmaking,1kvxoq,Tift,1 point,Fri Aug 23 01:59:46 2013 UTC,"That's my feeling, too, Tift. I have heard of others utilizing the same process before, and my intuition is that careful attention to the height of the plate (0.918 inches in the press bed!) should mitigate that risk the same as it would with a woodblock. Vandercooks are also pretty hardy, and won't let you print over something they can't handle.  It would make sense, however, to pay special care to the packing beneath the tympan-- thanks, dudebauer. I generally don't favor a lot of impression anyway.  I'm wondering if the smooth nature of the plate and large fields of color-- plus the wet paper-- will have implications on inking, whether that means adjusting strike, inking multiple times, or using a different kind of ink or viscosity. I'm hoping to try this within the next week or so, so I will definitely let you all know what I find."
printmaking,1kvxoq,seagazer,2,Fri Aug 23 02:29:41 2013 UTC,"Well, a Vandercook will let you print something that it can't handle, but not for long. You risk stressing the carriage bearings if either your plate is mounted too high or your packing is too thick. If you feel much resistance as the impression cylinder goes over your plate, stop.  Assuming your plate is type-high, you can determine the correct amount of packing using a micrometer and bit of arithmetic.  Your impression cylinder will have an ""undercut,"" which is the distance from the surface of the cylinder itself to the type-high plate or form. The undercut, expressed in thousandths of an inch, is generally stamped in the channel between the cylinder bearer and the impression surface,  seen when the carriage is at the feed board. Most often it's 0.040"".  You generally begin your test prints with your total packing plus your stock equal to 0.043"". This will produce a ""kiss"" impression. From here you can add packing until you get the desired impression, but good printing practice is to limit impression to about one-third of the way into your stock. Here's a little spreadsheet I use to determine how much packing to use.  I generally print on damp, not wet, handmade or mouldmade paper. If you try to dampen machine-made paper, you run into registration problems since the paper will stretch more in one direction than the other. Dampening paper is a whole other discussion. I use oil-based litho inks, stiffened, if necessary, with magnesium carbonate until a thread of ink dropped from the knife retains its shape for a few seconds. If you're printing large solid areas, you might add a tiny bit of Setswell compound to loosen the ink for better coverage."
printmaking,1kvxoq,Tift,1 point,Fri Aug 23 07:59:13 2013 UTC,"Seagazer, thank you! That last paragraph has a lot of the information I'm looking to work through. My training is in letterpress, and as such, I definitely know when not to force the carriage (I suppose a Vandercook would let you print more than it could handle, but you'd be a fool to push through that resistance). As always, I'll start with minimum packing and build up to a kiss impression, or not much beyond it."
printmaking,1kvxoq,Tift,1 point,Fri Aug 23 15:43:13 2013 UTC,"You know you could try simply doing a relief roll on your plate, printing on dry paper by using a clean brayer to  press the paper on that top surface.  Worst case scenario you waste a little bit of time and a little bit of paper."
printmaking,1kvxoq,Dugx0r,2,Fri Aug 23 02:44:24 2013 UTC,"Yes it can be done but the former printmaking studio manager in me cautions you against it. While the Vandercook is a very solid and durable press, if your etched plate is even the slightest bit higher than type high, jagged or otherwise warped, you are going to do damage cylinder or to the cylinder carriage assembly. As with pretty much every letterpress process inking over a large area doesn't always yield the best results.  But, I wish you good luck and please post some pics of your final result."

Don't even get me started on the damage done to vinyl records.  Also, when it come to shipping, an envelope over 15""/a package over 12"" is automatically considered a large package and will be subjected to additional fees.

printmaking,1km2it,smokel,3,Sun Aug 18 17:06:53 2013 UTC,"GET. A. TAKACH. I've been to their workshop and watched them make them, and there's no match for quality and service. They will also repair and resurface their brayers (there is a fee I think) which makes them a 'buy it for life' item, and I believe they come with some guarantees.  Everything is made by hand in a small workshop by a dedicated crew. I've also used them, and I wouldn't ever use anything else if I had a choice. Take good care of it and it will last you forever. They're rubber surfaced and the frame is powder coated steel which makes them easy to clean. They are pricey, but like I said, they last!  Edit- They are quite heavy, but I feel this is beneficial and prevents slippage and helps with getting an even ink film since part of the pressure is supplies by the weight and not the variable pressure of your hand."
printmaking,1km2it,bananabilector,2,Mon Aug 19 01:01:25 2013 UTC,"I've used a fair number of low quality brayers, so most of my experience stems from those. But it seems as though the softer materials apply ink far better than hard ones do--basically the squishier the brayer is, the better it works.   Of the brands you mentioned the only kind I've encountered are the Takach--they work well, but are way heavier than most other brayers out there, and personally I don't like the extra weight when I'm rolling out ink. It sort of throws off the balance of the process for me.  As for size, you probably want it to be as wide as whatever size block you typically use (unless that block is ginormous or something). Using a brayer that's not as broad as your block means that you have to make multiple passes to coat the whole thing, which can often leave visible lines in the ink from the edge of the brayer.  tl;dr: Squishy/soft brayers work well for wood, get one that's as wide as your typical block. Hope this helps!"
printmaking,1km2it,PanicAttackBarbie,1 point,Sun Aug 18 20:04:47 2013 UTC,"Don't go too soft on wood though, it will deposit ink on the inside of the cuts and makes the line muddy."

printmaking,1kjxhz,sasquatch_seeker,3,Sat Aug 17 15:40:26 2013 UTC,Nice image but it's over inked/too much pressure. You can tell when you look at the edges and it's all globbed up. When printing relief you want just enough pressure to transfer the infk from the block to the paper. If there's a visible impression from the block on the back of the paper or the ink has bled through than you are using too much pressure. Dial it back a bit and see what kind of results you get.
printmaking,1kjxhz,dudebauer,1 point,Sat Aug 17 19:00:55 2013 UTC,"Thanks for the tip.  The other prints weren't so heavy handed, but for whatever reason I only took a photo of this one. The main point of this linocut was to print it on a shirt, and that one turned out great!"

That's if you want to though, some prints look quite good when you can see the process coming through the image. A bit of hand-made sometimes has its appeal."

printmaking,1jtjx2,hatesbaseballcards,6,Tue Aug 6 16:45:45 2013 UTC,"Some suggestions:  You can attach an image onto your plate with rubber cement or some other reversible adhesive, then use that as a template for cutting. Make sure to reverse the image first.  You can also transfer a laser printed image using lacquer thinner and a spoon. This is particularly unpleasant and toxic.  Of course you still have to do the hard part of cutting all those circular areas, but that is art for you.  As an alternative you could try making a collagraph. You would built up an image using thick paper, and you can punch dots using whatever hole punches you have. You then seal up the plate with acrylic medium, ink it up with a roller and relief print."

printmaking,1jqw5v,pugglez,1 point,Mon Aug 5 22:50:37 2013 UTC,You're respecting the figure too much on the left side of the cup.  This looks accurate but I think you can get a broader value range.  Good jeorb keeping your hatching consistant.
printmaking,1jqw5v,Dugx0r,1 point,Mon Aug 5 23:13:34 2013 UTC,I really like this. Could also play around with bright contrasting colors
printmaking,1jqw5v,sqwirk,1 point,Tue Aug 6 12:17:40 2013 UTC,have you thought about doing a series of studies of the cup? they could be really good practice for getting your technique down because the content is simple.

printmaking,1jkvrm,ItsAnArt,4,Fri Aug 2 18:36:59 2013 UTC,watch Bill Fick Anatomy of a Linocut  Be sure to have a nice wide U and a nice V gauge.  Use a leather strop frequently to keep your blades polished and sharp.

printmaking,1jkvrm,pencilears,6,Sat Aug 3 04:57:51 2013 UTC,"I have a BFA in printmaking and mixed media and I did almost exclusively linocuts. here's my advice:  get a speedball cutter, it is now your new best friend. cherish it and keep your blades sharp. just like knives sharp blades are safer because they do what you want. use all of your different blades for line variation, makes things visually interesting.  use a bench hook and keep your bracing hand out of the way or invest in a box of cloth band-aids because if your hand is in the way you WILL cut yourself.   draw out your print on the linoleum in pencil (it's erasable) or sharpie (won't smudge) before you start carving. you can also take your drawing and hold it up in a mirror or that apple ""photobooth"" program that let's you take selfies. this makes it easier to catch backwards Ns and other glaring errors.   because linoleum is a carved surface you may be tempted to treat it like you are carving a design into it. honestly it's just like any other drawing, depth and dimension can be used just as well as anything.   people her have mentioned heating your block, the easiest way to do this is to carve in a sunny window, a warm room, or during the summer. hot plates can get too hot very easily and the block will off-gas solvents from the plastic and become brittle.   if you use oil based inks you will have to throw out your blocks sooner or later. print your edition and call it good. don't get too attached to your blocks. if you print in water based you can't hand color them with watercolors, nor get them wet, but it dries in a flash, you can properly clean the block, and looks almost as good.  I recommend oil based while you're still in school. save the non-toxic nonsense for when you're printing in your kitchen.  are you going to be doing colors? what did you want to make?"
printmaking,1jkvrm,pencilears,2,Fri Aug 2 21:02:44 2013 UTC,"As someone working towards a BFA, I thank you for being so thorough. I think we use oil based ink, but I'm not sure. I make a lot of odd combination pieces. One idea is a guys head kind of wired up to look like a tv set. Or like weird things (eggs with cities inside them, a severed head on a rollie chair)"
printmaking,1jkvrm,PanicAttackBarbie,2,Sat Aug 3 05:09:26 2013 UTC,"if you have to clean it up with oil and soap, then soap and water, it's oil based. if you have to clean it up with soap and water it's water based.   my advice for putting together a BFA show is to narrow your goddamn focus. make atleast one thing be consistent throughout all the pieces you make, this can be almost anything however: format, colors, theme, tone, recurrent characters, whatever it is, make everything hang together. additionally, make way more than you need for your show so that you can have some leeway to cherrypick your best works instead of relying on whatever you were able to do.  if you want to do cities in eggs, do a bunch of them. explore what that means both to you and to the viewer. make them beautiful, make them elaborate, make them rough and make them wonderful. make them real.   the point of your undergrad is to figure out what you like to do, the point of your graduate studies is to get really really good at that thing by doing it as hard as you can."
printmaking,1jkvrm,PanicAttackBarbie,2,Sat Aug 3 05:36:51 2013 UTC,"We have mostly oil based ink but I'm not sure if we use different ink. For woodcuts its oil based, so it might be the same ink? Thanks for the BFA advice. The only recurring theme I have so far is this factory based setting on ""how babies are made."" I might keep coming back to that at some point. Thank you so much for helping, its great to hear what people say after the work"
printmaking,1jkvrm,lotus-codex,1 point,Sat Aug 3 05:45:21 2013 UTC,"well, get out there and knock'em dead.   by which I mean you need to get to work NOW. you need something, possibly several somethings, even if they're just ideas, ready to show your teachers before you start the school year."
printmaking,1jkvrm,pencilears,2,Sat Aug 3 05:53:07 2013 UTC,"Oh that's been happening lol, that's why I at least have some ideas. I've got a lot.more to do, but I've had a good start so far!"
printmaking,1jkvrm,fraserlady,1 point,Sat Aug 3 06:00:12 2013 UTC,"This is good advice, but I have a couple additions to make:   Use woodcut tools instead of a Speedball cutter. They keep an edge longer, are better quality, and just work better.  An iron on a low setting works great to warm up a block.  Use transfer paper (the blue typewriting stuff is great if you can find it) to transfer images to your block; you can also transfer drawings onto a linoblock by making a photocopy, putting it facedown on the block, then rubbing acetone over the photocopy. The toner will transfer straight onto the block (just make sure it's a 100% black and white photocopy).  If you want to buy blocks outside your class, buy the unmounted stuff--you can cut it to whatever size/shape you want, then mount it to plywood or mdf yourself with wood glue. Much cheaper than buying mounted lino. (Unless you're using platen presses, then the pre-mounted stuff is already type high so go with that.)"
printmaking,1jkvrm,pencilears,1 point,Sat Aug 3 05:42:31 2013 UTC,"So, would you recommend transferring images as opposed to drawing them onto the block itself for linocuts? I tend to draw straight on the block with my woodcuts (taking care of keeping things that need to be reversed (words, letters, etc))"
printmaking,1jkvrm,Dvoie,1 point,Sun Aug 4 16:52:06 2013 UTC,"Totally your preference--I usually get my drawings all figured out in a sketchbook and have to transfer them, which is why I like the acetone method. Nothing wrong with drawing right on the block though if that's what works for you! The only thing to be careful of is the pressure you draw with--if you draw a line, don't like it and erase it, sometimes it can leave a sort of ghost line on the block from the indentation of the pencil."
printmaking,1jkvrm,meLIZZZZZma,1 point,Sun Aug 4 17:42:02 2013 UTC,"Thanks for clearing that up! Yeah I just get so excited and want to go, so I just go straight to the block!"
printmaking,1jkvrm,pencilears,2,Sun Aug 4 17:48:23 2013 UTC,"Hi so good to be able to ask questions to someone with your expertise. How do you keep the speedball blades sharp? Also mine came with 5 blades, 3 v shaped, 1 quite large semi circled one and one that is sort of just a flat scalpel like blade, what do you use those one for? And are these the only attachments you need for Lino or have you bought more for more variation? Thanks so much, I've just started studying art and am doing a reduction Lino, it's all very exciting and daunting."
printmaking,1jkvrm,meLIZZZZZma,2,Sat Aug 3 06:32:09 2013 UTC,"how do I keep my tools sharp? I use a Strop to keep the blades honed.   small blades for details and wiggly lines. one of the things I like about linoleum is how much curve you can get into a cut.   bigger v shaped ones are good for larger cuts, obviously.  the large scoop-blade I usually use for cleaning up large areas of white where I don't want any false printing to show through. I usually also use little pieces of clean newsprint on my block while printing to keep the big areas of white clean too.   the leaf-blade you can use like an ex-acto knife, cut a line and then carve up to it for a very crisp edge. or use it to trim up edges. I don't like that blade particularly, when I want a knife I use an ex-acto knife, but of course, those are more prone to breaking.   those are indeed the only attachments you really need for lino, honestly. I have more, but that's because I like to buy a new #1 (the smallest blade) every once in a while. you don't need fancy carving sets, but if you do get them, a set like This One is better suited to wood carving than a speedball cutter. (that is if you want to switch to wood, people recommend a medium density fiberboard, or MDF, but I find it frustrating to work with)"
printmaking,1jkvrm,fraserlady,2,Sat Aug 3 14:49:55 2013 UTC,Thanks so much for these tips!  Going to try newsprint in my open area now.  Thwarted all morning.

printmaking,1jkvrm,bowlss,2,Thu Jan 23 21:22:12 2014 UTC,"In feet temperatures, or if you're fond of less difficulty like me ;), you can place your lino on a hot surface on a low setting, and it makes carving soooo much easier!"
printmaking,1jkvrm,meLIZZZZZma,1 point,Fri Aug 2 19:06:23 2013 UTC,"I didn't think of heatung it up, we do have a hot plate, thanks!"
printmaking,1jkvrm,grovergrover,2,Fri Aug 2 19:32:58 2013 UTC,"don't work your lino at too high a temperature. if its hot on your hand, that will mean that your cuts will be less clean. the lino tends to get crumbly when its really hot. although that still is helpful when you are removing big areas, but watch the edge of your cut, as it may tend to break off unintentionally. the linoleum could also crack if you bend it too much, or small uncut areas could fall off.  also, be wary of working with linoleum that is too cold, as it will be more difficult to cut (although this is better for small detailing) your chance of slippage/cutting yourself gets higher."
printmaking,1jkvrm,GnomeRobot,2,Fri Aug 2 20:36:53 2013 UTC,So I could theoroetically cut my small details first. Then set it on low heat for big areas if I was in need of a quick removal of a large part?

If there's anything more specific you'd like to know, please ask. I could go on about it all day, but I'm sure a lot of people here are already familiar with the process, so I wasn't sure how much detail to go into.  As for my space, I would hesitate to call it a ""studio"". It's more of a cold, dusty, spider-ridden shed with some printing stuff at the back. :) It's only really useable in the warmer months, and it often gets overrun by gardening equipment and other random junk. So yeah, not the most ideal setup, but it's great just to have a space where I can print.

If you are interested in the ""trace monotype"", I recommend using a good etching ink + a small mountain of magnesium carbonate to get it to the right consistency. If you're doing the more traditional monotype technique, I've seen printers use really stiff litho inks as well as intaglio inks.  Just be absolutely certain you're not using too much or you may make a huge mess on your felts and blankets."

printmaking,1izzyu,GnomeRobot,1 point,Thu Aug 1 04:47:35 2013 UTC,"Hijacking the top comment on a 2 month old comment to ask...  Would there be interest in making a stiffer etching ink for use with monotype/woodcut? I'm thinking a basic series with one yellow, red, blue, black, tint base, and opaque white. That should be enough to get most colors via shop mixes.  The issue with using mag is the ink gets very grainy since the mag isn't anywhere near as finely ground as the pigment after going through the mill in our manufacturing process. This leads to trouble with getting fine details to print well, and also affects drying (the mag doesn't soak into the paper as well because of its grind).  There are limitations with how stiff we can get the ink made without adding mag ourselves, but we can mill the ink with the mag in it to greatly improve the grind over what is possible with shop mixes."

They pointed out the bin, gave you some gloves and you walked in and grabbed what you needed. The price per sq ft was way less expensive than buying it at any art store/supply place.  I googled it and as near as I could guess it was Industrial Metal Supply in Sun Valley (near the intersection of the 5 and the 170) www.industrialmetalsupply.com/ 8300 San Fernando Rd, Sun Valley (818) 729-3333"

printmaking,1hq1uk,EMCME,3,Sat Jul 6 00:49:33 2013 UTC,"Last year i started a series of lithograph and woodcut portraits of close friends.  It began as an exploration of the psyche, referencing how i felt about the subject, how I interpreted their own essence and being, and trying to produce that in a pattern/moving texture.  Their faces are meant to be decaying/melting to give the effect that their souls are literally pouring out from them.  They are caught in a moment of tranquility, frozen in this snippet of time where they are fully exposed.  The process went as such:  On a ~22"" x 30"" block i drew and printed the faces on BFK Rives 22"" x 30"" paper, usually an edition anywhere between 12-15.  The last run was on a sheet of mylar, which was printed and quickly brought over to the flatbed press which i then carefully lined up, and transferred the portrait onto a sheet of 1/4"" 22""x30"" birch plywood.  From then it was sketching out the pattern chosen and then printing several more layers onto the lithograph portrait.  Some woodcuts have one run, others have up to four.  I wanted to make them seem like it was all done in the same run, so i chose to print only in black and white and try to match the tones of the woodcut to the lithograph.  When all was said and done, i need to display them for an exhibition.   I had shown them prior to this show and while it was exciting to see them all in the same room, each image felt encapsulated by the edges of the paper.  These shifting patterns were stopping abruptly by absence of imagery, and i needed to find a way for them to expand beyond the confines of the paper.  So i decided to build frames for the three that were going to be shown and went on the idea that the frames themselves were reacting to the picture, where the patterns ended, the framework began.  I let myself react to the image before building the frames.  Where certain lines felt bold and fast, the frame would jut out and crawl across the wall.  While other lines felt rhythmic and smooth, swirling downward in a calm and soothing way.  The end results were really incredible to see on the way.  Stretching 5' - 6' in height and almost 5' in width in certain areas, the frames enhance the feeling of each image so much.  It gave life to two dimensions, pushing the boundaries of what i thought would be  possible with these prints.    If anyone is interested in more of my work it can be seen here at www.evanmcohen.com and my blog www.wetflakeybark.tumblr.com"

The figure of the woman has volume and looks dynamic; and it is easy to distinguish between foreground and background.  Keep it up!   One criticism that you can work on in your next piece is the proportions and perspective of your figure work. The front leg look stubby. The best way to fix this is to work on your sketch before you start carving.  The better and more fleshed out the sketch is the better your final product will be.  Can't wait to see more of your work."

printmaking,1gr9y2,ItsAnArt,1 point,Fri Jun 21 19:17:42 2013 UTC,"I never knew of Lino cut artist for quite some time. I started using a cat stamp, that i got from my local craft store, and started printing on priority mail stickers and would just put them around places. I soon got bored and wanted material of my own, but would use templates that other people have made, which transitioned into me making my own content. I've been doing it here and there for about two years, and I'm nineteen, so I am still very naive in the field. I haven't taken any classes so I'm not introduced with other famous artist in the field to be quite honest. Most of my outside inspirations I think would be artist like swoon, poster boy, blek, oclock, Shepard fairey, and others that I can't really think of at the moment. I suppose I just wanted my own originality amongst the street art scene. Unfortunately it's quite overlooked in most cases, presumably why I posted it in this sub, although I thought the content matched the category.

I can give your more information on the tools/techniques I find the most effective if you'd like. I feel like linocuts have always been written off as a ""high school""-y medium, but from everything I take on (wood burning, needlepoint, watercolor, etc) it's by far my favorite medium because it allows you to really express yourself in every cut you make. I encourage anybody who appreciates the final product of relief prints to give it a shot. Takes a lot of heart and I think it's very therapeutic. Good luck!"

So, I'm wondering if it can be saved. I'm thinking of creating a second block with the missing line, or cutting a piece of the outline on the other side and see it if balances it out.   Thoughts? Suggestion? I know there are other parts that could use some tweaking, but I'm really obsessed with the most obvious error I made at the moment."

This is because the oil allows just enough light to pass through the white part of the paper that it works perfectly. Think window to weight gain from the simpsons.  Oh and glad you dig the transparency, you can get that by adding transparent base or extender base to your inks.

So, if you're starting out with a light pink everywhere, then covering with black, the light pink won't be visible anymore.   If the light pink is visible (through registration errors) it can often bring a piece together and help to create a sense of ""unity."""
