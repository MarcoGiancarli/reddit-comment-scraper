In the APG III classification system, it is placed in the family Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoideae (formerly the family Ruscaceae).  It has also formerly been separated (sometimes with Cordyline) into the family Dracaenaceae or placed in the Agavaceae (now Agavoideae). The majority of the species are native to Africa, with a few in southern Asia and one in tropical Central America. The segregate genus Pleomele is now generally included in Dracaena. The genus Sanseviera is closely related, and has recently been synonymized under Dracaena in the Kubitzki system.

I don't remember the last time I drank water I didn't have to boil, or showered, or slept on a bed that I didn't then stuff into a pack on my back the next morning. I don't remember the last time I heard someone speak my language. It's just as well, though; it's been so long, I almost worry I may not remember how.  We are social animals, meant to group together. Our very bodies reward us with good feelings when we touch, or smile, or talk.  ""This is right,"" the chemicals in the brain say. ""Be happy. This is how you are meant to live.""  How is it I can feel this, then?  I don't remember the last time I spoke. My voice is gone. Not scratched out by illness or injury, simply faded to nothing.  That is fine. I have nothing to say.  I don't remember the last time I touched another. When by chance our paths cross, we wave from afar but do not approach.  That is fine. I have no one to hold.  How is it I can feel this, then?  We are meant to live together, to group in order to grow. But I do not. I walk.  I walk, and I see, and in doing this, I know.  Far from anyone, from anything but the world itself, I walk alone.  All alone, and yet so...  ...happy."

All their life in this world and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover and the title page: now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read: which goes on for ever: in which every chapter is better than the one before.” ― C.S.

ImaginaryWildlands,2u1m6m,Waterrat,1 point,Thu Jan 29 18:50:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's really fun to imagine living life in wilderness with a completely different color scheme. It makes me reflective and think about all the ways that green plants have influenced our language and culture, and how that would be different in a world like that. I love a picture that can set off such a train of thought."
ImaginaryWildlands,2u1m6m,wizardcats,2,Fri Jan 30 03:07:31 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean....It's really interesting. I wish I was a sf writer, I'd so drop the reader onto a world like this."
ImaginaryWildlands,2tvzra,sacredserenity,1 point,Tue Jan 27 21:49:03 2015 UTC,I guess the thing that's seems odd to me here is that the pools of water aren't horizontal. The water isn't obeying gravity here.

ImaginaryWildlands,2t1ye9,95Mb,1 point,Tue Jan 20 14:50:18 2015 UTC,Are there any good guides to painting/sketching perspective work like this? I've always wanted to try my hand at it.
ImaginaryWildlands,2stuyy,Lol33ta,3,Sun Jan 18 13:38:59 2015 UTC,Check the whole Wormworld Saga! Its great and free! Daniel Lieske is a great Artist who quit his job for creating the Saga. You can support him by purchasing the Wormworldsaga App for iTunes or Androit.
