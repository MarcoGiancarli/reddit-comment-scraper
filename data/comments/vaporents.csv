vaporents,3e32ev,SavageCore,4,Tue Jul 21 16:18:20 2015 UTC,Why does the price say $205 when it's clearly stated $250 for the lowest price on the site?
vaporents,3e32ev,Dakroon1,3,Tue Jul 21 18:41:23 2015 UTC,"It's a bundle. The Pax 2 alone is $205 at the lowest, if you opt out of the bundle."

vaporents,3e32ev,CumShotsFired,5,Tue Jul 21 16:37:30 2015 UTC,Ya because its sold below MSRP
vaporents,3e32ev,bill_clinton00,4,Tue Jul 21 16:40:33 2015 UTC,Massdrop will take care of any issues and basically honor the 10 year warranty themselves.
vaporents,3e32ev,CumShotsFired,4,Tue Jul 21 16:52:34 2015 UTC,Then it's even more worthwhile. Thanks!
vaporents,3e32ev,evilbadgrades,2,Tue Jul 21 16:59:14 2015 UTC,"Better hope so, because Ojan over on FC stated this several hours ago: ""This is correct. Massdrop is not an authorized seller for our products so there won't be a 10 year warranty with a PAX purchased from them. I mentioned this in a previous post a few pages back, but my search-fu isn't strong this morning.""  I know I personally would rather not try to save a few bucks and risk my warranty over it."
vaporents,3e32ev,cjax2,3,Tue Jul 21 19:04:53 2015 UTC,"Massdrop will take care of any issues and basically honor the 10 year warranty themselves.   I rather not pay $80 more for a ""limited"" 10 year warranty that I'll never use (absolutely never used it for my PAX 1 and i don't even use it anymore, it's sitting in a drawer a year later.) Especially if Massdrop stated they will take care of it."
vaporents,3e32ev,rlaitinen,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"How do they know where you got it? They can't realistically expect you to keep your proof of purchase that long, so after two years, I feel like they're just gonna ask where you got it, and you can say, ""Oh, my local headshop, and no I don't have the receipt"" at which point they'll ask for the serial and and swap it out. Magic Flight is like that too. They say they won't cover the warranty, but in reality, they do."
vaporents,3e32ev,clicksanything,2,Tue Jul 21 23:50:03 2015 UTC,is this worth upgrading over the Pax1? I've had mine for about 6 months now wondering if I should make the switch
vaporents,3e32ev,dannydorrito,2,Tue Jul 21 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"As a pax 1 and pax 2 owner I will say the pax 1 gets the job done just as well as the pax 2, but the pax 2 has great aesthetic quality and better battery life. I personally don't like their oven temp technology on the pax 2 and for that reason I sold mine to pre order the grasshopper instead. If aesthetics and battery life are huge to you, then get the 2. If not, then I recommend just getting yourself a water pipe adaptor to water filter your pax vapor"
vaporents,3e32ev,clicksanything,2,Tue Jul 21 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"did your grasshopper ship yet? I heard only some lucky backers started receiving theirs recently, and thanks for the suggestion! I once got 3+ hours out of my pax by turning it on n off when I need it so battery life isn't that huge of a deal. I think Ill stick with what I have for now haha n already got a water pipe for delivery on the way"
vaporents,3e32ev,dannydorrito,2,Tue Jul 21 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"nope mine hasn't shipped and probably won't for a while, but I'm very excited for the grasshopper. I think it will be a great unit"
vaporents,3e32ev,Astram7141,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:41 2015 UTC,What is the pax pusher and is it worth getting for the pax 2?
vaporents,3e32ev,dannydorrito,2,Tue Jul 21 18:12:34 2015 UTC,Its a small stainless steel device the size of the oven that allows one to pack less in the pax 2 while maintaining efficient vaporization of the herbs. It is not essential to use with it but it may help if you don't like packing full bowls in a vape
vaporents,3e32ev,Astram7141,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, think I'm gonna get the pusher"

vaporents,3e32ev,ReeG,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:52:30 2015 UTC,In my experience I will just do a tight half pack in the oven and then use the oven door once or twice during the session to make sure that it stayed packed. Though I do have the Pax Pusher.
vaporents,3e32ev,_LordHelix_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:15:47 2015 UTC,How much does it take to fill the bowl normally? I'm thinking of getting one to take out instead of my Solo which I'm used to using pretty small amounts in.

Anyway, I think everyone should check out this video before purchasing :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fwfg2HHWoIc"
vaporents,3e32ev,LotusKindaSutra,2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:15 2015 UTC,From what I understand they aren't an authorized retailer so you have to make your claimes with Mass Drop and then they will talk to Pax on your behalf. Or something like that.
vaporents,3e32ev,dannydorrito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:20 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, that makes more sense. Although whenever I've dealt with plooms customer service they just ask for the serial number on your vape"
vaporents,3e32ev,LotusKindaSutra,0,Tue Jul 21 17:55:52 2015 UTC,What was the point of sharing that video? There's a number of actual reviews with actual herbs in the oven of the Pax 2 that claim it is very consistent and a solid portable vaporizer.
vaporents,3e32ev,dannydorrito,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:21 2015 UTC,"The point is that your herbs are touching a surface that's 390 degrees on even the lowest temperature setting, where harmful byproducts can start to be formed in the vapor. Many people here want precise temperature control, and for that they shouldn't buy the pax 2. If you don't care about that and/or still combust, then this is a great deal for you. Not trying to bash Ploom or anything, I use the pax 1 myself"

For pot the only place I went to was Uncle Ike's Pot Shop, which was outstanding.  Food:  the sushi there is top notch bc of the amount of fresh fish and enthusiasm for it they have.  We went to Glo's for a massive, excellent breakfast.  Glo's coffee was not that great (Seattle has kick-ass coffee so if you like great coffee you should be able to find it other places).  I recommend going to the Gasworks for the view and the sun dial (any time of day will be great there, but the sunrise and set there may be pretty cool)    Got to Fremont and see their neighborhood and the huge statue of Lenin that they have..  Ballard is pretty cool, there is a ton of stuff to do there that doesn't require you going towards downtown really, so if it's anywhere around rush hour I'd recommend sticking in a neighborhood like Fremont or Ballard just to avoid wasting time sitting in traffic.    Go to the EMP museum!  It has a lot of cool Star Wars costumes, an indie game exhibit (full of playable games), a Nirvana/grunge/rock history exhibit, and a pretty fucking awesome nerdy scifi/horror/fantasy exhibit.  We went to see the campus and the library at the University of Washington, holy god that place was gorgeous and impressive.   I don't know how well the mass transit works in Chicago, but in Seattle it's amazing, and riding the bus just feels right.  Give it a shot too if you'd like!"

vaporents,3dz8fv,ChromeForty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:37 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile so I can't really take a close look at the picture but it looked like OP broke it and then used it as a home made stem for his Solo. It looks like he is saying that they broke the end of it because the stem was too long to fit inside his bong, very poorly done job by the person at head shop and I hope he got it for free lol  If only the end is chipped and no where else then you're safe if you sand it down. The only dangerous thing here is inhaling chips of glass and not vapor coming in contact with glass shards.  I had an Arizer Solo stem break while it was inside my 14.5mm bubbler and now at least half inch fell off so I wouldn't put my lips on that. I now use it with my water tools, if there are glass shards they will get pulled in the water and not directly into my lungs so I'm safe with that."

vaporents,3dz8fv,bryanxm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:08:44 2015 UTC,"The lady at the headshop where I bought it had to shorten the glass stem so it would fit my bong. While cutting the end off of it, it broke. However, I sanded it down so there aren't any sharp points anymore. The only thing that's wrong at the moment is that there's a small dent in 2 sides but it actually makes the piece fit really well between my lips. In the picture it looks really bad though for some reason."
vaporents,3dzx8z,jfrsn,3,Mon Jul 20 21:56:25 2015 UTC,"This looks like a call out to me possibly, so I'll answer. :)  Of course NO one needs an expensive device and the amount of material needed is mostly based on tolerance.  I've had an E-nano for almost 2 years, the only Purple Heart nano in existence I believe, and I agree it's a fantastic vape. I always recommend the E-nano if efficiency and conservation is most important. But it's a peeshooter for my tolerance needs, the loads (flower) are simply too small.  Here is my own E-nano convection dab video done over a year ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0KD6p43uzk  My favorite bang for the buck vape is the blemished LSVs at $140. Brilliant vape."

vaporents,3dzx8z,Steinfarm,2,Tue Jul 21 01:57:15 2015 UTC,"Steel wool is inert, so it shouldn't impart a taste. Make sure its a very high grade of steel wool, not the stuff you clean your stove with."

vaporents,3dzx8z,VaporSlob,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:56:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've done cotton plenty but there is always a risk of singe and always, even when not singed, a taste I just didn't cotton to (har har).  A tight plug of 316 stainless steel wool has has no taste and no chance of singe. I used level 10 on the nano in that video if I remember correctly.  The trade off is you will have more reclaim that gets through the ss wool.  if you do use ss wool (and I * the 316 stainless part because thats important, dont use any old steel wool) you'll want to make your plug for your gong as tight as you can before is restricts airflow too much... trial and error. And tap in on a table to get rid of loose steel fibers."

vaporents,3dzx8z,VaporSlob,2,Tue Jul 21 00:07:26 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. bro.  Extremely hard to compare tolerances as so many variables. I am also a heavy daily user of well over a decade.  Anyway, yes indeed I prefer the LSV over the E-nano. I'm not alone in that preference as I know others on FuckCombustion who've moved from an e-nano to the LSV (the latter takes more technique but has a higher upside IMHO).

Much more tasty hits than the Sub. Enano is convection only, Sub has a heavy conduction aspect to it also.  When I really want to savor flavor the Mighty or Enano are my choices."

The guy who stole my cash has 2 felonys now, so he got what he deserves. I know this is not going to help you, but I thought I should share it with you. Was that the only thing they stole or was it more?"

I loaned him $200 to help with his car payment because he lost his job and with the delay getting another check from his new job he was gonna miss a payment.   Lots of bullshit went down but he did actually end up paying back $140 of it, so not nearly as bad as you. But then he just stopped, and got angry that I didn't buy him a birthday present.   Then he got mad cause a girl he liked was really into me, but he did have dibs so I backed off. The mere fact that I just ASKED him if he still wanted dibs was enough for him to end the friendship, blocking me on Facebook and all. Lol.  Bitch got her pregnant and now his entire life is ruined. Karma is a bitch indeed."

Not as efficient as a vape like the e-nano, because the minimum bowl size is ~0.1-0.2g, but way more efficient than smoking. If you want hands free, get the ground glass attachment, I have no clue if the cosmetic seconds comes with that or not. I would email them. Maybe the dab attachment if you like dabs.

vaporents,3e1bs2,KanyeWest_GayFish,2,Tue Jul 21 04:57:24 2015 UTC,I recommend spending $169 and getting either the arizer air or goboof alfa.
vaporents,3e1bs2,truesoul42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:58:50 2015 UTC,"My buddy has the Air that I've used a few times, but my problem with it is that it takes too long to finish the bowl and get high. I would prefer something that goes through weed quicker."
vaporents,3e1bs2,truesoul42,2,Tue Jul 21 05:08:44 2015 UTC,You could try using the alfa at medium and high temps (goes higher than the air). That will finish your bowl fairly quickly.
vaporents,3e1bs2,truesoul42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:18:34 2015 UTC,"Might be a dumb question, but is heat the only major factor that determines how big rips are?"
vaporents,3e1bs2,truesoul42,2,Tue Jul 21 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"No. Airflow, grind consistency, packing tightness, the weed itself, draw speed, vape heater strength, convection vs. conduction, and surface area of weed touching the oven (conduction vapes only), all affect the size of the rips."

vaporents,3e1bs2,Chuckl8899,2,Tue Jul 21 05:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, a flowermate will produce less vapor than the air and solo. The pax will create around the same amount and maybe more, but it also requires you use twice as much weed. The mflb vapor totally depends on technique, and you tend to get closer to combusting than the flowermate, so it might produce more vapor, but at higher temps. And I have never used the hammer so I'm not sure. The air is better than the flowermate in nearly every way (in some areas not by much), if that helps."
vaporents,3e1bs2,truesoul42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:49:36 2015 UTC,"As to the hammer, that and the lotus are about as hard hitting as it can get. The biggest hits I've ever gotten have been from it."
vaporents,3e1bs2,HikaruEyre,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:53:30 2015 UTC,"That's because they get hotter than most vapes, and very close to combustion. I honestly never got great vapor with the lotus, only very mediocre vapor. The best I've gotten from a portable is with the crafty ($288)."

vaporents,3dzgy0,vapient,2,Tue Jul 21 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"There is one other big difference, pass through charging. The mighty uses true pass through so if the battery is dead it still works plugged in and also won't strain the battery while being used on the charger. The crafty doesn't because it's using micro usb, the unit won't charge as fast as it drains while in use plugged in and of the battery dies the unit won't work.  Mighty also heats up slightly faster and doesn't need a blue tooth connection which further drains battery to set exact temps, although once you set your favourite and use the boost it's not an issue for most.  Performance wise it's the same design though yes."
vaporents,3dzgy0,Hyroero,7,Tue Jul 21 02:11:05 2015 UTC,I upgraded from the Air - I prefer the vapour quality from the Crafty.  P.S.  Anything is better than the MFLB.
vaporents,3dzgy0,OG_LH,2,Mon Jul 20 21:21:30 2015 UTC,"Idk I just got the Air after having used the MFLB for a while, and personally I still prefer the MFLB as far as vapor quality. Definitely like the ABV from the Air a lot better though. The MFLB is wonderful though once you get a good grind and a good vape method going."
vaporents,3dzgy0,Allanthia420,0,Tue Jul 21 10:51:13 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have to ""get a good grind and vape method"" though. Especially for how much they charge for the unit.  With the air and crafty it's just pack and vape."
vaporents,3dzgy0,TheHighestEagle,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:53 2015 UTC,"BUt there is only one way to hit the Air, and anyone can come up with their own method on the MFLB. It's just got character. Not for everyone, but it's just a fun piece that's really easy to carry around and hide in one hand."
vaporents,3dzgy0,Allanthia420,2,Tue Jul 21 20:06:18 2015 UTC,"P.S. Anything is better than the MFLB.   You've never heard of Atmos? or Grenco Science? or Kandypens?  Seriously. This is the shit that bugs me. Talk trash on the actual trash. The MFLB isn't for everyone, and it's not a powerhouse by any means, but it is a solid vape. Does what it advertises, consistently. You can't say that for any of the other products I mentioned."
vaporents,3dzgy0,pacifica333,0,Tue Jul 21 16:02:15 2015 UTC,MFLB is pretty trash compared to all of the vapes I've tried. No idea how they can charge so much. Should be like 50 bucks.
vaporents,3dzgy0,TheHighestEagle,0,Tue Jul 21 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"Lifetime no questions asked warranty.   Frankly, I still go back to my MFLB time to time. It has some of the best vapor quality out there. Again, not a powerhouse, but the flavor is off the charts.  In terms of vapor quality, I still feel it bests the Crafty. The Crafty gets me higher faster, but if that's all your goal is, you should be doing concentrates. For me, the Crafty wins because of it's portability, mUSB charging, and it's power. It may not be the best choice for you, personally, but to call the LB trash is just plain wrong. Given your other comments, you clearly want a no-fuss low learning curve portable. That is exactly what the MFLB isn't - it's a simple device that requires technique to get the most out of. Go for a Flowermate if you want pack and go."
vaporents,3dzgy0,pacifica333,2,Tue Jul 21 19:22:10 2015 UTC,I have both. The crafty is the more portable of the 2 IMO. The glass stem makes it difficult to carry in a pocket. Obviously you could get a third party wooden stem. The larger bowl of the crafty also allows me more vaping time without having to worry about reloading. I treat my air more like a cordless home vape.
vaporents,3dzgy0,psychiguy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:06 2015 UTC,Why don't you use the pouch every air comes with? Makes it very easy for me to safely carry the air and 2 stems in my pocket. Also has a belt clip for those wearing ugl....skinny jeans.
vaporents,3dzgy0,Malamutewhisperer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:14:21 2015 UTC,"It's the difference between taking the stem out, making sure it's clean enough not to make a mess, putting both parts in the pouch and then pocketing that.  VS.  Put the Crafty in your pocket.  It's not a monumental task either way but one process is still objectively simpler than the other."
vaporents,3dzgy0,towcools,2,Tue Jul 21 16:55:46 2015 UTC,"I own the Mighty which is the same internally as the crafty and the air.  The crafty will blast through what you put in it super quickly. You can do smaller hits by using the liquid pad. The battery will last you 45minutes of on time and it's going to heat up within a minute or two, variable based on ambient temp and charge level.  The air takes a bit longer to heat up and takes longer to vape your herb, both a con and a pro. Sometimes I want a more drawn out session not a blast to the face.  The air battey last a little less in my experience and takes a good 5 minutes to get the most out of heating up. The biggest draw is it's appearance which is very similar to an e cig. You can swap the battery out on the fly and the 18650 battery type is cheap and common, I already had about 5 of them from other electronic items.  It has a glass stem but you can get so many different attachments like a wooden stem, smaller or larger sizes etc.  The air has a temp control on the unit which you can select from 4 or 5 presets, I forget. The crafty has 2 and a boost but you can use your phone via Bluetooth to control and read the exact temp.  Crafty charged via micro usb which is neat but will not charge if too hot and isn't true pass through so the battery will still drain faster then it charges of in use.  Because it's micro usb you can use those battery packs for phones to keep the charge up when not in use too.  Personally I got the Mighty because I need the extra battery and the extra size isn't a problem since I have a bag everywhere I go and it fits in my pocket in a pinch, kinda like two small phones stacked together kinda. It also has true pass through and on unit temp control and display.  Probably forgotten a heap of shit so shoot any specific questions at me and I'll do my best but other wise I hope this helps!"

vaporents,3dyvo6,Frostiestone,2,Mon Jul 20 19:12:05 2015 UTC,"That is definitely a huge upside! Now the difference between the Pax and Pax2, would it be worth it to just pick up the original Pax? Or is the Pax2 worth the extra $100?"
vaporents,3dyvo6,firmHoldOnEasyWorld,3,Mon Jul 20 19:57:25 2015 UTC,"IMO the Pax 2 is worth the upgrade. It got rid of all the downsides of the first Pax (a big one is having to clean it at least once a week, which wasn't too big considering it takes about 5-10 minutes). There's plenty of comparisons. Check out vape critic and vaporizer wizard for comparisons between the two. You can search this sub as well for more reviews on the Pax 2. Don't let the naysayers steer you away from it though. It is a great vaporizer. I've had a friend's for about 2 months now and am just saving up to buy my own. It's ideal for being out and about. Slips right into my pocket. I use it while on campus and in between classes."

vaporents,3dyvo6,f1key,3,Tue Jul 21 20:45:45 2015 UTC,Flower mate mini or v5.os I suppose
vaporents,3dyvo6,ur_mamas_krama,3,Mon Jul 20 17:33:16 2015 UTC,What does she prefer to use now?    Is she good at keeping things charged? Will she be using it in public (needs to be small)? Will she be carrying it in a car (needs to be low residual smell)? How often will she clean it (some vapes are less matainance)? Does she like couchlock (vapes are more of a head high though some give couch lock)?  Does she prefer to get really stoned or just buzzed? Does she usually smoke alone or with people (beware of some portables)? How much does she care about build quality (many cheaper vapes or built poorly imo... it's a tradeoff)? How much does she care about taste (research convection vs conduction)? How often does she smoke (some vapes are more efficient)?  I've used/owned a bunch and would love to make some suggestions.  $70-250 will get you a solid vape. :)
vaporents,3dyvo6,DatDirtyThrowaway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:56:44 2015 UTC,"Right now she uses pipes (mostly she likes a little mini pipe I got her a while back) and sometimes edibles. I vape with nicotine liquid and am very strict on keeping my batteries charged and my vape clean and rebuilt so yes she will be cleaning it regularly and keep it charged haha. Probably won't use it in public too much, except on hikes but they are in fairly secluded places. She smokes pretty regularly throughout every day, except before work or class, but she's pretty good at handling it. A hell of a lot better than I am. I can't even really tell the difference between when she's high or not, living together is the only way I know. Usually she smokes alone, but occasionally her friend will come over and they will smoke together. Or I might take one hit here and there with her. Build quality would probably need to be at least not the absolute worst. She's a little clumsy sometimes so I imagine it might take a few bumps. And to be honest I'm not sure how much she cares about taste, I don't think she's used a vaporizer before so I don't think she knows what she's in for :)"
vaporents,3dyvo6,Yage2006,5,Tue Jul 21 02:44:57 2015 UTC,"Sweet, thanks for the insight.  From my perspective dry herb vapes have different hangups than pens/boxmods.  Look out for battery life, charging options, cleaning A few things that stood out to me...   She vapes a bunch of times a day... avoid something that has an internal battery (Solo, Alfa, Flowermate)... it will get worn out and she will inevitable forget to charge it.  It's nice to have something that can charge fast and/or from usb and/or from a car.  You may be able to get away with a vape with great battery life. She vapes alone... no matter how you cut it a bowl only lasts a session.  It just doesn't feel right leaving it for later.  Get something with a bowl thats on the small side (Lotus, MFLB). It will be a companion style vape ideally traveling with her throughout the day.  Get a non session style vape so she can hit it sorta quick and get on with her life - imo warmup time is one aspect that puts people off vaping.  Look for convection with fast heatup.  Get something with great build quality because it will get knocked about while traveling (Lotus, MFLB, Firefly... imo Arizer quality is meh).  No one likes having a vape thats beat to shit.  Look for something low maintenance.    Butane vapes are under rated imo.  They offer some of the best flavor, thickest hits, no recharge time, innate durability, and low costs.    Unless she really NEEDS the portability imo isn't worth the downgrade to an oven style vape.  This includes the Pax and Alfa.  If you choose the flowermate you are making a tradeoff.  It's cheap and small but there are similarly priced portables that are slightly larger that will preform better.  They are session vapes so imo there more of a group vape  They also gum up a lot quicker.  I'd check out the following:   Lotus: Butane vape.  Works great with the aluminum stem.  I love how thick the vapor is and that there is no warm up.  I can take a few hits and move on with my life.  Amazing bang for your buck.  I clean mine and refill butane ever 20 or so sessions. Trii House: butane vape.  beautiful, sturdy, portable. The Nimbin (4.0): butane vape.  small and cheap.  basically an engineered baby vape pipe. Other butane vapes: The hammer is neat because it has a lighter built in and more traditional plastic/glass construction (ew imo).   Vapman is cool, but probably to finicky.  Vaporgenie is a low cost option, but probably not for you.  Theres also the newer iolite but idk how reliable they are. Airizer Air: Electric midsize portable with external battery.  A bit more expensive but it's more approachable as a true vape.  I've never been impressed with Airizer's build quality but it's supposed to be decent with the Air.  I was never impressed with it's predecessor, the Solo, but this unit is generally well received.  Overall it's a nice vape.  Just not amazing in any sense imo. Firefly: Luxury portable.  This totally blows the price aspect, but it's a nice vape.  Shinny and a nice companion vape.  Much more of a head high.  I like that you can swap batteries - I keep a second in a charger in the car.  I prefer my Lotus but this is nice sometimes because you don't have to deal with the flame.  It's a very low maintenance vape. Mighty: Never used one but reviews are great and it has some nice features - the Volcano is amazing.  Plenty of battery life though the battery can't be removed.  The vapor quality should be great   E-nano: good companion vape though it is a at-home always on vape.  Something worth considering. MFLB if she smokes that much.  Imo it's a perfect beginner/novelty vape but could be a pita for her.  Hit's are wispy... it's like tea rather than coffee.  I know stoners who love them but there not for everyone. The ability to keep ll my herb in a test tube, swap batteries, and no smell make this vape one of my favorites.  That said i need my Lotus to knock me out. Keep an eye on the grasshopper - it isn't shipping to new customer yet, but will be amazing.   Remember, it may be best to try to do one thing well rather than completely replace smoking.  Herb vapes aren't quite where e-cigs are. :)  There are some good deals on used stuff at r/entexhange and the fuck combustion classifieds.  Be real careful with warranties though even if you buy new - a lot of places only have a few 'authorized sellers'.  Ryot makes some awesome smell deterrent cases.  Tldr; I'd have a deeper look into butane vapes.  They really do preform like vapes and you great build quality and better vapor for your buck.  Lotus or Trii House vape would probably be the best fit.  If you want to stick with an electric vape the Air would work.  If you want to go high end the Crafty/Mighty are probably your best bet."

You sure know your stuff haha her birthday is still about a month away so it looks like I've got about a solid 2-3 weeks of research reading up on the pros and cons of all these different vapes. Thanks so much for all the info! After all these replies I'm sure I'll be finding the perfect one for her in no time.
vaporents,3dyvo6,pinis_trickle,2,Tue Jul 21 03:53:18 2015 UTC,Haha thanks man :) She's gonna love it.  So the Trii house vape i'm think of is the Lilly.  The more I think about it the Hammer is probably a better fit than the Lilly.  Like I use 1/3 the bud in the Lotus that I would in the Alfa which is just less than i would use in a bowl. :) Good luck!
vaporents,3dyvo6,soggycereal7,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:59:22 2015 UTC,Not OP but I'd love your advice as I'm ready to purchase a vaporizer.  My budget is $200.  I currently smoke a bowl at home.  I have no problem keeping things charged.  I have no need for using it in public- at-home use only.  I don't like couchlock - tend to smoke sativas and hybrids and then head out on my adventures.  I usually only smoke enough to lift my spirits- rarely to get really stoned.  I almost exclusively smoke alone and generally only on weekends.  I want to spend the money for something high quality.  I also want something that won't stink up my house.  I currently store my bowl in a zip lock bag because of the smell.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

I have a davinci ascent which I love, great features, accurate temp control, good vapour and battery life, only negative is it doesnt standup so it is awkward to load having to hold the entire vape and try to pinch trees into the chamber is less than elegant in design. BUT I do love it lol. For close to $100 you will probably have to go with a magic flight launch box as the rest of the portables tend to be $200 plus."

vaporents,3e3hld,Chroll0,15,Tue Jul 21 17:51:07 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an authorization error with the bank. The request was probably submitted to the bank/authorization company, it pre-authorized because there was a balance on there. Then when it checked some identifying information (name on card, billing address, etc) it didn't match and declined the transaction. I'm pretty sure you have to register the cards online with a customer name, billing address, etc before making some/most/all online purchases. But then again, I've never had to use a disposable card.  Holds on accounts can last between 1 - 72 hours, in my experience.  What you need to do is:    -Calm the fuck down. Not to sound mean/like a dick or anything, but it's not the end of the world. It will just require a little work on your part. Brink of tears? It's a vaporizer.  You didn't just learn about an inoperable tumor. -Call the issuing bank/card issuer's customer service line. They should be able to look more in-detail at the transaction and why it was declined, when the hold will release, etc. Also ask them what you need to do in order to buy something online with it and have them input the necessary information to register it for online purchases. -Call puffitup.com. I've bought stuff from them, they're super nice IMO. They can give you details as well.  Take a few deep breaths. It's just weed stuff."
vaporents,3e3hld,PotViking,4,Tue Jul 21 17:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, its likely not a posted transaction, just an authorization error. Not puffitup's fault, rather the fault of whatever disposable card you bought. Email or call puffitup, I'm sure he will sort this out."

vaporents,3dzo2b,thealexster,4,Mon Jul 20 20:51:08 2015 UTC,"So since you want something that you can stretch out over a while, you want an on demand portable vape, or a convection desktop. Are you opposed to a desktop?  Just noticed you said portability isn't required.  I suggest you check out the Silver Surfer Vape, the cosmetic seconds (scratch, or small blemish during manufacturing) is only $160. It can be stretched out over a few hours unlike the portables you listed (which are session vapes). It works super well for multiple people or one person, and they sell a ""flavor oil"" kit which makes it usable with dabs (and it works really well).  Here's a link: http://silversurfervap.com/  Here's a cosmetic seconds link (from what ive read, most people can't even find the blemish, or its tiny, email them for more info): http://silversurfervap.com/index.php/silversurfervap/sale/blemished-silver-surfer-vaporizers.html  From everything you wrote, I think this vape is perfect for you. Its cheap, easy to use, can be puffed on slowly (just remove the whip from the vape), can work with dabs, and is good for solo use or for groups.  Another vape you could check out is the e-nano, however it doesn't work too well with dabs, but is more efficient than the SSV and uses less weed."
vaporents,3dzo2b,truesoul42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! Looking at the vapes, they both look nice: the silver surfer does look perfect for what I'm looking for. However, how much less weed does the e-nano use? I'm a pretty light user and not trying to up my use too significantly.  Dabs are really a second thought; they would be a nice bonus if a vape could use them, but not required at all."
vaporents,3dzo2b,truesoul42,2,Mon Jul 20 21:41:45 2015 UTC,"Each bowl on the e-nano is around 0.05g to 0.1g, maybe slightly more. A bowl on the SSV is around 0.1-0.3g (big bowl so you can fit how much you want). The e-nano is a bit more efficient (you'll get high with a little less weed, but not by much), which mostly comes from the small bowl size. However, both are way more efficient when compared to smoking. I personally think the SSV is better for groups unless all of you have relatively low tolerances."
vaporents,3dzo2b,truesoul42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:48:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the help. One last question, mostly just for my own reference: I imagine any good portable on demand vapes cost quite a bit more, but are there any you would recommend? Or session vapes that use a very small amount of herb?"
vaporents,3dzo2b,truesoul42,2,Mon Jul 20 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"A good on demand vape is the firefly ($250). But it takes technique to learn how to use, and the vapor quality won't be as good as a good desktop. Some session vapes that work with small amounts are the arizer air (0.1g min, $169), goboof alfa (0.1g min, $169), and the crafty (0.1g min, $288). The crafty is the closest you'll get to a good desktop vape in a portable. All of the session vapes work best if you have 10-15 minute vaping sessions, and don't work well with on and off hits."
vaporents,3dzo2b,AstroSatan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:00:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks! You've given me a good walk-through, and some future things to look at. I'll probably pull the trigger on a silver surfer, that looks to be a perfect fit for me.   If I was to get a portable at some point, do you think a firefly or going the pen/oil route would be a better bet for my smoking style?"
vaporents,3dzo2b,evilbadgrades,2,Mon Jul 20 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"The firefly I think. I had a year long period where I only smoked dabs and oil using a pen, and it drove my tolerance up pretty high, and was not as enjoyable. I then switched to vaping and its honestly amazing, I can get to the same level of high with way less, and it hasn't changed my tolerance. The firefly, once you have the technique down, is perfect for taking occasional hits and for your smoking style.  I recommend you watch videos on the SSV and the firefly to see how they work and how to use them, and whether or not you like the technique of using them. Also, another portable vape (just started to ship, but if you order now you'll get after September) is the grasshopper. It's on demand, only $135 (as of now), and seems to work well, but time will tell."
vaporents,3dzo2b,Allanthia420,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:18 2015 UTC,I used a one hitter for years. I bought an Underdog log vape and its even easier to use and more efficient than my old trusty metal bat and haven't had to use it for 4 months now.
vaporents,3dzo2b,HikaruEyre,2,Tue Jul 21 02:17:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly one of the hardest things for you will be to find a vape that provides that instant heat for that single hitter. A portable single-hitter is still a dream of mine (I'm hoping the grasshopper will fill my dreams of an instant-on single hitter).  That said, I still LOVE my e-Nano log vaporizer - I use it daily (it's slow to heatup, but I keep mine running 18 hours a day without any problems after 13 months of use)"

Search for the elbow pack method, that will further increase the performance of your EQ. The differences are convection vs conduction (pax will cook weed when not being used), the EQ will give you more vapor at the same temp, and the vapor will be cooler due to the whip. The EQ has precise temp control, and can make bags. I personally would take the SSV over the EQ if bags aren't going to be used, but either will give you better vapor than the pax 2 imo."

vaporents,3dzj41,BIG_JUICY_TITTIEZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"yup, and its just ok. Some people mess around with stove top coils or mesh wicks but I just put it right on my regularly wicked coil. It works but it is far from ideal. I would say its good for when your out and about but you may need quite a few hits to get where you want to go."
vaporents,3dzj41,Zathras_listens,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:44:24 2015 UTC,it's good just take the cotton out and smear it on the coil. hits pretty hard and usually gets the whole dab in one hit
vaporents,3dzj41,FuckablePBJ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:51:44 2015 UTC,Why take the cotton out? I haven't used my globe atomizer yet as I'm unsure why everyone says to remove the cotton
vaporents,3dzj41,r4cid,2,Tue Jul 21 02:10:43 2015 UTC,Take the cotton out so it doesn't absorb the wax as it melts. A bare coil will nuke it all in one go.
vaporents,3dzj41,onijin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:24 2015 UTC,Thanks! Why is the cotton even there then?
vaporents,3dzj41,r4cid,2,Tue Jul 21 05:52:25 2015 UTC,because RDA's arnt made for wax.  the cotton is to wick up ejuice to the coil.
vaporents,3dzj41,D1STURBED36,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:02 2015 UTC,"I have a globe atomizer specifically for wax though, and it has cotton in the middle of a single coil. I'm not referring to an ejuice atomizer"
vaporents,3dzj41,r4cid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:24:03 2015 UTC,"Any pics? I can think of a couple reasons I wouldn't wanna use any cotton, the first and foremost being dry hits. If your wick is too dry, you get what's called a dry hit. It tastes like Satan's dirty bunghole and burns like hell. Imagine ripping a gram of ABV through a bong with no water in it, then double that misery. Unless you're vaping a lot of wax, you're bound to get some dry hits. Also, some of the wax that gets absorbed is gonna stay right in the middle of that cotton, which is a bit wasteful. Plus, I'd think it'd just get all gunky and bleh after a very short while. If I was gonna dab with my RDA, I'd probably do a twisted 26 gauge macro coil and wrap it a few more times than I normally would to bump up the resistance. Then I could just slather wax onto it, and it'd get absorbed into the channels of the twisted wire and vaporize without needing a wick.  You could probably get away with using a cotton wick if it was a really tiny coil, though."
vaporents,3dzj41,r4cid,2,Tue Jul 21 23:34:17 2015 UTC,"I'll have to upload a picture when i get home, as its hard to get across clearly what I'm referring to."

vaporents,3dzj41,FuckablePBJ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:27:33 2015 UTC,the wax would get stuck in the cotton and you'd be smoking burning cotton and wax. not very appetizing.
vaporents,3dzj41,r4cid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:10:33 2015 UTC,Agreed. What's the point of the cotton to begin with?
vaporents,3dzj41,HellsWindStaff,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:52:38 2015 UTC,"Keep cotton in, if you using a traditional RDA IMO."
vaporents,3dzj41,Novakoner,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:07:54 2015 UTC,At least make a coil that will hold your material as it melts... Its better than any other portable option I've come across.

vaporents,3dyoco,santaeid,5,Mon Jul 20 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"Dude, dude, dude.  All these grinders are awesome, but I am biased and haven't seen this one mentioned. I've personally owned a sharpstone (knockoff, mind you) that I had for seven years and barely replaced with a Santa Cruz Shredder.  Yes, Santa Cruz the skate company.   The SCS is a badass grinder man, the teeth are trapezoidal, so it has four blade edges per tooth.   The grind is insane man, especially if you flip it upside down and grind it, you don't even need a finishing grinder.  They are a bit pricey (~$50-70), but it would be worth it. I know that's my bias, but coming from someone who has used a sharpstone and a space case (my bro owns one), the SCS out performs both.  I mean, just look at how evenly ground this is."
vaporents,3dyoco,zondwich,2,Mon Jul 20 21:29:58 2015 UTC,"Wait,  is it really made by the same Santa cruz? Either way this is the one that gets my vote.  My buddy has one and it grinds extremely well.  And although I'm sure it has something to do with the bud we smoke, that thing produces more kief than I've ever seen.  Like, a single gram will leave you with a good fingernail of kief. I scraped the threads of the kief compartment once and ended up with a whole bowl"
vaporents,3dyoco,PKfire12,2,Tue Jul 21 00:23:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they make a special edition LRG grinder as well.   Dude tell me about it! I put one eighth through it and had more keif than my sharpstone after a month."

vaporents,3dyoco,simplesouvenir,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:20 2015 UTC,i can't speak for the ones you mentions but i love my large space case. still sharp after a solid two years of use. feels sturdy and solid. and it's big enough to work out of. as opposed to dumping a smaller grinder out onto a tray or something.

It does the same thing as the $20-$60 versions of itself but so much better in a way that's not immediately apparent when coming from a cheap version.   Would definitly recommend
vaporents,3dyoco,KILLAH-WHALE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:41:38 2015 UTC,Amazon normally has really good deals on good grinders
vaporents,3dyoco,llampacas,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:07 2015 UTC,"Sharpstone does a decent job and has a really smooth mechanism, but they do not offer any warranty.  However I can say they are well worth the price if that is the price range you are looking for. As far as the quality of grind goes, Santa Cruz Shredder is best. As far as warranty goes, Cali Crusher and Compton are better than Space Case and Santa Cruz because they have removable, replaceable screens - the warranty never covers the screens.  Personally I prefer Compton because of the loading zone and I really like the shape of the kief catcher... I guess it all depends on what you want out of your grinder."

vaporents,3dvcfa,RenSxSan,6,Mon Jul 20 21:28:46 2015 UTC,"I'm real sorry about your mother, friend. :(  But yeah, it's absolutely for health reasons why I went fully vape.  I had been combusting for a while, and a friend let me try his PAX, and not only did I get to my usual high in a much smaller amount of herb (I can't deny looking at the trough and doing the mental calculus there may have been a SLIGHT perk to going vape-only...), but it didn't feel like I had smoked at all, in my lungs and in my throat.  Then I went back home to my bong and yup there's cough that cough that cough cough burn.  I still smoke socially, like if some very nice person brings a joint to whatever gathering, but man alive you could blindfold me and ask me if I just combusted or vaped and my lungs screaming would tell you every time if it was smoke.  Plus me and my PAX buddy both know a guy who's in his late forties, career smoker, hay hay hay smoke weed everyday kind of guy who had had some cancer scares, and he's always coughin' and hackin' like nobodies business and one day after a particularly bad bout of it, we got to talking with him about it and me and my buddy were both like ""yup, vaping only from now on.""  I'm using the E-Nano now primarily, but I'll probably be picking the PAX back up when school starts.  This damn E-Nano, though, I can't say enough about about it.  You'll probably be perfectly served by the DBV, but if you're ever in the market for another desktop vape (perhaps one for the bathroom?), investigate the E-Nano.  edit: Also, shit, you know what, I think this is pretty well documented already, but I feel like I've got two different tolerances.  Like, I smoke on very rare occasions, right?  It gets me high like... well, like I haven't smoked in months.  And yet I've been vaping the entire time.  So there's that benefit, too.  By the way, you'll have to excuse the quality of this post. [6]"
vaporents,3dvcfa,thepinkservbot,3,Sun Jul 19 22:33:02 2015 UTC,"It's an eye-opening experience, for sure. The E-Nano looks great, it's a really nice size. With the DBV I realized that I need to have a dedicated spot for it, next to my couch for example. Right now, the short whip and large size of the vape make it a tad bit awkward to use without worrying about placement. I see myself trying other units for sure; and would eventually succumb to the convenience of a portable unit as well. I'm just glad I bit the bullet, and think about all the ABV I will now be stock-piling. And yeah, smoking here and there is going to become a special little treat type-thing, which is nice.

Make sure the vape is all clean though, because you don't want to blow dust into the vaporizer. Also don't set the temperature to high, because the intake for the air isn't really meant to heat up much.

I have found that packing it in a sort of medium tightness gives you great airflow maximizing what you get from it. You can do a lot with very little.   -Don't try to draw like your having a soft drink, but rather a milk shake  -Don't take hit after hit without leaving some time in between. let your bud vape a little then hit it  -Try to ghost your inhales as much as possible. Because smoke and vapour have different compositions its better to try and hold the vapour in your longs as lungs as your comfortable with it.  -If this is your first vape i would recommend using the ""green"" temperature setting first then moving up to red or orange.

I think spending a little more is worth it since the air is much more portable than the solo. I am going to be mostly using this for home use with some on the go trips (snowboarding).  The reasons why I decided to go for the air are:   swappable batteries better vape quality than most in the same price range (reviewers, redditors and FC claim this) $155... i wouldnt mind spending more for a longer lasting vape... I'd get it replaced with the 2 year warranty.

I prefer the Herbalaire, which someone else recommended, and the Rise 2.0 for budget dual mode desktops.   The HA is tastier and you don't have to grind material, but I didn't care for its bag setup and have mostly used it with whips or a long dry hydratube type setup. It's a very good vape, though, and is often underrepresented in these kinds of threads. And, again for emphasis, the vapor really is tasty.   I use my Rise for bags nightly and use the hookah mode with four whips for the rare party. I think the Rise is the best bag blower under $300 and would compare it to the Zephyr Ion, vapor quality wise. It can even do multiple bags like the HA, although I prefer using the Rise 1.0 bag system which is just one balloon at a time. The Volcano is going to outperform it with bags every time, but the Rise is easier to use smaller amounts with, does whips well, is the best party vape, and is way cheaper.  If you don't care about bags at all, then go with the SSV. It's the best whip vape I've used."

But the SSV is better for groups. I recommend you get that. The EQ has the option for bags, but overall it's worse than the SSV. Also, the SSV is great for groups cause it has a big bowl, and its easy to swap the herb for new herb, unlike the EQ and some other desktops."

When I first started that seemed to be the case for me, but as I nailed down my inhalation technique and such I've now started to feel a bit of a buzz right away.

Helps me take that much needed long ass snooze after my set is over and get used to regular sleeping. Plus I like being really high for the first couple days and sitting on my couch playing games or watching tv.  That first night I also had to drive across town and get money from a guy for my old man. Do not recommend.

If you tend to vape a load until there's no more vapor, the ABV will be very weak. If not, it'll be stronger.  If you think your ABV is weak, go for 5-7 grams. If it looks lighter, go for 3-4 grams.

Not really vapor bonging though, the main difference is if you attach your vape to an actual bong you have a chamber that you can build the vapor up in and hit it all at once. With one of these hydratube things you're just going to filter it through some water minus the chamber.  Really helps make the vapor less harsh and for me removes the dry or sore throat I get from higher temps.  Fun to use too."
vaporents,3du8op,Hyroero,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:50:56 2015 UTC,"They look like they're a pain to use though. You would have to hold it upright all the time. I guess they could be fun to use from time to time, but I would take a traditional bong hooked up to a vape over this as a daily driver."

Don't get it, very bad filtration and the risk that the water leaks is too big."
vaporents,3du8op,ChromeForty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:47:34 2015 UTC,"Oh, I wasn't planning on getting it. I've already got a bong which I know I'll love more. Namastevapes gets a bad rep around this sub but I've actually had a good experience with them. Arizer Solo's are usually around 197 euro's here, but I got one for 150. Maybe the Dutch site is just better, because the example shown above makes no sense. Who are they kidding, nobody's gonna buy that at $75."
vaporents,3du8op,RenSxSan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:23 2015 UTC,I use one on my desktop cloud evo and compared to dry ripping it keeps the sore throat at bay while still giving me good flavour.  I mix it up between that and a full size bong for higher temps but honestly it's a pretty good device and totally does filter even if it's to a much lesser extent.
vaporents,3du8op,Hyroero,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:15:42 2015 UTC,"It depends what you're after, of course if you want flavor this thing is really the best thing you can get.

It worked fine on my portable but when I went to use it with a bag or my HerbalAire it's way too harsh to even be enjoyable.   I personally hate the taste and do my best to get rid of it.."
vaporents,3du8op,ChromeForty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:21:02 2015 UTC,It's also way larger though. I can throw the f bomb ( the plant vape version I use ) in my bag very easily.  While I don't really use it on the go it's still very small and accompanies me on camping trips or vaping around my property. A small drink bottle is enough to fill it up a million times since it uses only a small amount then I simply empty it with a shake before I pop it back in my bag or what ever.  It's niche but they totally have their uses.
vaporents,3du8op,Hyroero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:50 2015 UTC,"No, the F Bomb is something very different. It has holes instead of slits and it's taller. There is proper filtration in that water tool, just look at the difference in price and you'll see why. ($110 vs $20) I've had my Chinese knock-off leak for no reason when it wasn't being moved."
vaporents,3du8op,ChromeForty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:00:48 2015 UTC,In terms of being portable yeah. I do use mine on my desk top Evo though when I want more taste and less filtration and it still keeps the sore throat at bay.
vaporents,3du8op,Hyroero,2,Mon Jul 20 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"My opinion, since you're asking for it, I think using any water adapter on a portable is retarded. That's just me. If you're at home and using it, that's a bit more sensible. But I'd be afraid of getting water into my devices. Vaporizers aren't that harsh to me, so I can bear it. I understand others can't handle it though and need a handicap of some sort to help deal with the heat pain associated with vaporization."

I had to talk to the owner (who I might add sounds like a prepubescent little bitch) a while back about my shipment going to amsterdam and it was the most difficult transaction imaginable. They lied about have certain items in stock on the site and instead of telling me they just decided to ship the package whenever they felt like it.  Looking into the owner and its clear all he wants to do is copy others and hope it makes him money. If luck is on our side the company will shut down soon and the owner will kill himself.

Then fill the tree perc through the mouth piece/long tube. You want about more or less 1 cm above the slits.   If there is too much water, you can put your thumb on the male joint of the bong (take off the bowl piece) and put it upside down. Only the water from the tree perc should leave the bong if done right, that way you don't have to refill both percs.   You should never have water enter your mouth when you clear your bong ;-) Good luck!"

vaporents,3dvwbe,RoachForLife,2,Sun Jul 19 23:40:56 2015 UTC,"Define ""compare"". Size wise there's no comparison, a portable vape is smaller than an EQ.   Every real herbal vaporizer on the market will medicate you. The differences come down to taste, vapor density, temperature control, and heatup times.    Some portable vapes blow the EQ out of the water, some don't.  A portable vaporizer is simply another option to medicate.  The biggest difference between plugin and portable vapes comes down to power conservation - desktop vapes can run much longer and often handle larger loads than a portable vape.  But portable vapes are.... well.... portable.   I use a desktop every day (E-Nano), and I also use portable vapes when I'm out and about.  But there are people who use portable vapes exclusively and love them.   The PAX2, Crafty, and Air are three very different types of portable vapes - you'll need to decide what you're looking for - stealth, price, or performance  If it's your first vape, the EQ is a fine intro vape if you don't mind being tethered to an outlet with a bunch of pieces to manage.  I typically suggest people start with the Arizer Solo since it's cheap and reliable.   Again, every vape will medicate you. It's all a question of how long it will take - some desktop vapes could medicate you with one load in a single hit. Some portable vapes can do the same thing, other portable vapes would require a 15-20 commitment to vape the entire load.  Also for what it's worth, every vaporizer is different, and it's good to switch them up from time to time - feel free to start with one vape, but you'll quickly lust for more. I have 7 vapes right now, and I use every one of them at least once a month, and they can all medicate me with enough effort (some require more sessions/loads to get where I want to be)."
vaporents,3dvwbe,evilbadgrades,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:01:32 2015 UTC,"this is a really good comment. personally i prefer some of my vapes to others and use those exclusively,one for at home,one for outdoors."
vaporents,3dvwbe,choooochoooo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:45:58 2015 UTC,"True, but after several months with the same vaporizer, it's good to pull one out of the closet that you rarely use and try it out. You may find yourself getting more medicated using the same quantity of herbs (this is called ""vape signature"" - over time you'll build up a slight tolerance to a vape)"
vaporents,3dvwbe,evilbadgrades,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:54:18 2015 UTC,"Do you find every vape has a ""few week love affair"", whereby when you first try it out it is the greatest and that slowly fades away? Even with the Crafty?"
vaporents,3dvwbe,dunvilsteev,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:38:02 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no. When someone first acquires a new vaporizer, there is that love affair effect in which it's the greatest vape in the whole world. But the interesting thing is what happens when you switch vapes for several months and then jump back to the other vape. I think it's more a factor of how you use the vapes that makes the difference (IE - switching from a Log to a different Log probably won't do much - same as switching from the Crafty to the Mighty. But switching from the Crafty to a Davinci Ascent and back again might work)"

What I do is google image search whatever I want, let's use glacier national park as an example, then go to ""search tools"" then ""size"". Find out what your screen resolution is if you don't already know and put that in under ""exactly this size"" or w/e it is. I end up finding some amazing wallpapers this way! Doesn't always work, especially if it's a fairly obscure location or game/movie/show or whatever you wanted."

However, if you are fine with a desktop vape, get a Silver Surfer, they are only $160 (cosmetic seconds) and will give you vapor quality equivalent or better than the crafty (which is a portable). Other good desktops are the Da Buddha Vape (cheaper SSV), Arizer EQ (worse than SSV but has bags), E-nano (super efficient log vape with great vapor quality)."
vaporents,3dw2xq,truesoul42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:02:55 2015 UTC,"I would definently recommend the enano in your situation. Better vape overall then any portable, including the crafty/mighty IMO.

vaporents,3dw2xk,Leafrunner123,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:39:17 2015 UTC,"They have the exact same size bowls. As far as the draw resistance, the mini's storage chamber on the bottom has a direct connection the bowl so you can use the slider to control the draw resistance, something not available on the standard v5.0s. If battery isn't a factor, I'd definitely go with the mini because it is much more portable and charges via micro usb. They both function the same so vapor quality is going to be identical. It basically comes down to what is more important to you, bigger battery or portability and micro usb charging"

I will say with waxes or any concentrate that it is in your best interest to let the coil and dabs that have recently been heated to re-set the on the coil itself (meaning if it has a bottom coil to leave it upright after  usage to recollect the ""scrapage, redabs"" whatever you would  call contents that would  otherwise resolidify on the sides of the chamber,as opposed to being collected by the coil or your happily receptive lungs"

Again the volume (probably due to smoke) on the coil from direct contact heating, is so much larger than the pen. Additionally the pen feels so much easier on my lungs. Maybe I am not used to the luxury XD The coil on my vape mod is 2.2ohms and I run it at 10V pulsing it."

So if you are looking for a bigger change then you have no choice but to go in a new direction. For a suggestion on possible vapes I would recommend looking at the E-Nano costs a little more (around $40.00) but it is easy to use, reliable and efficient. Good Luck"

vaporents,3duyki,LotusKindaSutra,2,Sun Jul 19 19:21:04 2015 UTC,The Pax 2 would be more 8-9/10 in you ranking system. The Pax 2 is a pretty huge upgrade compared to the og Pax.
vaporents,3duyki,muddybunny3,2,Sun Jul 19 19:45:35 2015 UTC,I've tried both and I would go with 8 max. The Pax 2 is definitely an improvement on the 1 (which I own) but the Crafty is on a completely different level.
vaporents,3duyki,LotusKindaSutra,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:18:14 2015 UTC,I haven't tried either of the Storz & Bickel portables so no comment on those. But the Crafty and Pax 2 also have two different scenarios in mind. The Crafty is a more powerful portable but also bigger and less discrete. The Pax was basically designed around getting high and being unnoticed.
vaporents,3duyki,muddybunny3,2,Sun Jul 19 20:26:18 2015 UTC,"Sure the crafty isn't as stealthy (it's smaller than you think, though, still pretty stealthy), but in terms of quality it is much better. The efficiency and vapor quality is top-notch."

vaporents,3duqbq,DirkDirgler,3,Sun Jul 19 17:44:52 2015 UTC,I wouldn't make any conclusions just yet - atmos sucks and won't vape consistently. You should try a vape where you can actually set a specific temperature.

vaporents,3duqbq,truesoul42,2,Sun Jul 19 18:07:18 2015 UTC,Yes try a better vape at a higher temp. And yes I notice a huge difference at different temps. I think most has to do with temp rather than strain.
vaporents,3duqbq,truesoul42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:13:48 2015 UTC,I'm looking at buying an E-nano (the most important thing in my current situation is efficiency and making the most out of smaller amounts). Would you say moving its gauge up can also activate the good amount for a body high?  Still though... I wonder why the body high was present at all in this case with the multiple draws? If the high temp wasn't there wouldn't the 8 draws I took have resulted in a smaller body high? The right body high was blanketed under the paranoia and that's the part I'm scratching my head about the most. :(
vaporents,3duqbq,Durtndur,3,Sun Jul 19 18:23:37 2015 UTC,Yeah the e-nano is amazing for efficiency. And yes turning the dial up will work.

vaporents,3duqbq,sargeantbob,3,Sun Jul 19 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"From my understanding, the type of high you get actually depends a lot upon the strain type, meaning sativa or indica. When it comes to the different methods of ingesting it, short separated hits are going to bring you up slower than large, consecutive hits simply because the rate of ingestion is much lower. I would recommend trying a nicer vape to get an even heating and go for a lower temperature. Then see if you can find a pure indica strain. I think the real problem lies with experience. As you smoke more and get used to the feeling, you should be able to reassure yourself that things are okay and there is nothing to be paranoid about that you wouldn't normally be paranoid about. I'm not sure if this helps, just my putting in my two cents."
vaporents,3drj6j,JackDostoevsky,6,Sat Jul 18 19:35:48 2015 UTC,"That's a great vape and she didn't steer you wrong. Extra batteries for the Air are cheap and you should buy a bunch, depending on your usage (plus an external charger). High-energy battery usage has inherent dangers so there are issues to be aware of. Please do your own research before buying anything and use it properly and safely. I've had great luck so far with NCR18650Bs from amazon or http://vapepower.ca/ These batteries will also give you two or three bonus sessions over the stock battery.

vaporents,3dtvxi,WifoutTeef,2,Sun Jul 19 12:55:34 2015 UTC,"You won't be disappointed by the Arizer Solo or Air. You should also look at the Goboof Alfa, another quality conduction vape. I prefer the Air: small, discrete shape; good efficiency; very easy to clean. The glass stems can be a bit fiddly to fill/empty on the go but you can use the stem caps to preload them before leaving the house. It easily hooks up to glass as well.   your bonus questions: 1. yes, you will save on bud, compared to combusting it. how much you save depends on your stash and your tolerance. 2. yes, by definition, any vape creates AVB. AVB has already been decarboxylated, so you can dump it straight from the vape into your mouth if you want (or into yogurt, peanut butter, spaghetti, etc)"

If you're worried about being clumsy, I'd say no glass. I have the flowermate V5.0s and love it, but based on what you need I would say buy an Arizer solo and pick up a wooden stem. There is tons more info on the solo on this sub so just hit up the search bar.  Finally, all vapes smell, not as bad as smoking, but they smell. If you'd like to vape in your room, make sure to have good ventilation and something to reduce smell like incense, febreeze, and/or a smoke buddy (carbon sploof: blow into it to reduce smell on vapor leaving your lungs). This is of course if you don't want anyone else to know. If you don't care, vape in your room, crack a window and in a half hour or so the smell will be gone.  EDIT: for where to buy, I'd say see if puffitup.com will do a price match (look through this sub, they always get fantastic reviews) but if not order it off eBay. That way everything will come out to about ($150)."

vaporents,3dp67q,Ellron23,4,Sat Jul 18 04:04:41 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends on the darkness of your AVB. I've eaten a gram of dark brown (think mulch) and I didn't really feel it.   Start off with a gram to be safe, just letting you know results will vary."

vaporents,3dp67q,Frostiestone,2,Sat Jul 18 04:15:09 2015 UTC,If you're vaping it that dark then it'll probably take more to get you feeing anything. Also remember that it will be mostly the higher end cannabinoids so the body effects will be very heavy

After an hour the high hit me like a tonne of bricks worst thing was each time i felt like i was getting better a new wave of high hits me. I eventually threw up and passed out in my bed. Havent been that high in ages.
vaporents,3dp67q,zaaaac,10,Sat Jul 18 17:38:19 2015 UTC,I've read on reddit that edible tolerance has not much to do with smoking/vaping tolerance because if you eat something it will go through your liver which breaks the cannabis in another way down than smoking/vaping does. But lost the source and it may be stoner science.

Why don't you try vaping only very few times just to get the light AVB. Then vape the rest to your hearts content but use that barely vaped weed for edibles.

vaporents,3drgxu,gcruzatto,2,Sat Jul 18 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"Depending on chamber size / stem length, the vapor will build up slowly. At a certain point, it will build up so much it will start freely flowing out of the top of the mouth piece, and this is where you begin to lose vapor.   I always wait a couple seconds after warm up to let vapor build a bit, and then take little 3-5 second draws. No huge clouds, but it gives the chamber plenty of time to maintain the perfect temp without any loss."
vaporents,3drgxu,ahonken,2,Sat Jul 18 21:09:56 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily true. A lot of chemicals are not visible, and might actually be leaving the stem before the vapor (lower boiling point cannabinoids). So you might lose some stuff even if the vapor has not yet reached the top."
vaporents,3drgxu,truesoul42,2,Sat Jul 18 23:14:39 2015 UTC,"Wow, really? That's something I wasn't aware of in the slightest. I stand corrected!"
vaporents,3drgxu,ahonken,2,Sun Jul 19 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"yup! just like if you vape at around 340F, you won't get any visible vapor, but you will still get high. Because THC's boiling point is lower than that. The visible vapor is much more dense, so it will take longer to reach the top of the stem."
vaporents,3drgxu,truesoul42,2,Sun Jul 19 00:24:33 2015 UTC,"Fascinating, you learn something new every day. Thanks for the info! I always assumed no visible vapor = no thc."
vaporents,3drgxu,ahonken,2,Sun Jul 19 00:25:38 2015 UTC,I dont have any sources but its mostly common sense and experience. I have an air and if i put it up to a light i can see vapor escaping from the top. Ive also left it on with fresh bud by accident and came back to see my bud brown. So yes it does waste cannabinoids.
vaporents,3drgxu,dankAir,2,Sat Jul 18 22:04:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on the vaporizer. If it's a conduction vaporizer, yes. Until the oven shuts off (and then cools down), the vaporizer will continue to cook the herb.  Some vaporizers which use convection or IR may not produce heat until you begin pulling air through the oven.   Note some vaporizers which use a majority of convection may still have some conduction properties (""Heat soaking"" we call it when letting these vapes sit for 30-seconds before starting your hit).   So in practice, it's best to power off/remove the load from the heater when not in use with most vaporizers."
vaporents,3drgxu,evilbadgrades,2,Sat Jul 18 22:10:29 2015 UTC,"As one commenter once said ""you can't really sweat over every last bit of vapor. People don't sweat over your joint burning between drags yet we worry about vapor leaking."" I just see it as the angel's share. In the end you're still saving way more than than smoking. Of course if you turn on your vape and then not use it it's a waste bit I if you're counting and trying to get every bit of vapor then you're not going to have a chill session."
vaporents,3drgxu,RandomGuyinACorner,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:49:27 2015 UTC,"A vape is a bit different than a joint, in that a bowl runs out a lot quicker than the joint due to the amount of bud used being usually smaller. That's why I have a larger concern over wasting vapor than wasting smoke."

It always bothered me that the g pro had a plastic/rubber vapor path as opposed to glass/metal like the flowermate (or say a pax or air). Also, as others have said, very inefficient compared to my flowermate, .6 in the g pro didn't even get me close to as high as I get from even .2-.3 in the flower mate. However, if you're just looking for some functionality, g pro isn't the worst option out there"

I'm an avid e-cig vaper already so i head a mechanical mod and a spare RDA (decent; $40). I built a special kind of coil, vaped 2 grams of wax little by little. By the end of it my RDA was essentially fucked, wax melted and solidified all over the inside and outside. I would recommend using a CHEAP rebuildable atomizer for this reason.  The high is strong, the hits are super rough and taste awful. Also wicking the wax/oil to the coil is difficult, i ended up using no wick at all. Cotton is useless. I've seen videos of people using a wire mesh wicking material with supposedly good results. never did that. Overall, I wouldnt really recommend the whole mech mod and RDA method."

I took it apart and found that the air path goes by the chamber insulation and it gets scorched giving off the bad taste. The Herbstick is supposed to have a separate chamber so that may resolve that type of issue.

However, there's a lot of tother improvements like better lower heat level  vaping, a little better efficiency, and way better battery life.  Regardless of which one you choose, I highly recommend you implement the ""screen trick"" for half full bowls, or just buy the prefab pieces from newvape that do the same thing.  It really makes a huge difference, at least for me."
vaporents,3dr99i,Splitsurround,2,Sat Jul 18 19:36:34 2015 UTC,What's the screen trick? Sorry. Pretty new to this! Thanks for the help
vaporents,3dr99i,Splitsurround,2,Sat Jul 18 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"Basically, take a screen you'd use with a pipe, and fold it so it's rounded, like half an oval.  Then, after you pack the bowl half or a third trick, you place this screen on top of the herb (rounded side down), then put the oven top on.  This helps to heat the herb evenly, and produces WAY larger clouds.  Go get 'em."
vaporents,3dr99i,VaporizerWizard,2,Sat Jul 18 20:54:51 2015 UTC,Yea that seems a bit pricey for a used pax 1. If you could get it for under $100 it would be worth probably. The cleaning involved is much more than the new Pax 2 but you could save $150 as well so totally up to you.   Overall I think you will be much happier with the pax 2 investment and plus you'll get he 10 year warranty on it if you buy it new.
vaporents,3dr99i,VaporizerWizard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:03:01 2015 UTC,What do you think between the Pax 2 and the arizer products?
vaporents,3dr99i,dannydorrito,3,Sat Jul 18 20:42:05 2015 UTC,"I think the Pax2 is much better if you are looking for a vape on the go, and something to carry in your pocket, but if you are looking for a vape to use around the house, the Arizer products are solid.  I find the glass stems a bit cumbersome for a portable on the go vape though."
vaporents,3dr5hy,ditto797,2,Sat Jul 18 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"I have the 5.0s as well, so here's some basic stuff I would have liked to have known when I first got mine: •its usually best to start on purple and then move up to red once vapor production on purple slows down • pack your herb down pretty tightly, the tool it comes with is extremely helpful for this • to clean the screen, you can use iso but if you just want a quick clean between sessions, I use a plastic golf tee and scrape it on the screen, it gives you a much better draw with relatively little effort • if you want to vape kief, its usually best to go herb-kief-herb (although I have done straight kief and it is not for the faint of heart) and just go straight to red, it doesn't vape as well on blue or purple • after using your 5.0s for a couple weeks, there will be small ""dabs"" that form between the glass of the mouthpiece and the rubber connector (right under it on the metal to be more exact), you can use the packing tool to scoop these up and scrape onto the side of the oven. Use an empty chamber (aside from the dabs), as any other material will just stick to the dabs and make them unable to stick to the wall of the chamber. Be careful, as these are extremely potent even though they're pretty small, but they're really awesome and require very little effort to make use of.  Cheers :)"

vaporents,3dost3,Soupses,5,Sat Jul 18 02:12:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, I found with the stock stem I was often trying to wiggle the stem and readjust things to get consistent airflow.

Since I've been using the stem I haven't had to wiggle it around nearly as much."
vaporents,3dost3,joanzen,3,Sat Jul 18 03:35:28 2015 UTC,"Give it time, compare the vapor quality (not the pull quality) with the stock stems and then update us.  I made a ton of these after buying a cheap diamond accessory kit for my dremel and everyone loved them initially but only 1 person has stuck with the turbo stems and keeps bringing me stocks to turbo for him.  I personally like them when I use the Solo with a water bong or the Magic Flight Orbiter (which works fantastic with the Solo), but when it comes to just me n the Solo, I use an non-modified stem."

vaporents,3dost3,joanzen,2,Sat Jul 18 14:27:12 2015 UTC,Density is the big thing for me personally. With the stock stem it's denser vapor that is much richer in flavor and less 'thinned out' with extra air?
vaporents,3dost3,joanzen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:01:05 2015 UTC,"Really? I've honestly not had an issue with the density - all I found was that it was very slightly harsher.   In fact, I've found it easier to get a consistent density."
vaporents,3dost3,ohsnapt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:11:48 2015 UTC,It's a bit like those cheap aluminum pipes lots of ents started off with.  They had these little screw on caps with a hole in the top and if you used the cap the smoke coming out was much denser and thicker because you'd get less air mixed in.   Course the lids also caused the bowl to self roach requiring a lot of relights so most people didn't like them.
vaporents,3dost3,60sremix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:39:09 2015 UTC,After reading more opinions I feel like its definitely a personal decision depending on your technique.
vaporents,3dost3,Sn00zy_Pineapple,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:34:58 2015 UTC,Yeah. It's not like I'm offering any science with my 'seems denser' argument; I know I can't explain how the density would change in a cite-able conclusive way.   In fact someone could waltz in here and science us up saying that the air flow determines extraction so more air means more extraction.
vaporents,3dost3,Sn00zy_Pineapple,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:17:18 2015 UTC,"My not qualified self thinks that its dependent on draw speed and technique.   To pull air through you still need air to go in. I just use the turbo stem so I can use less effort to draw, not draw faster. This allows me to do a more controlled draw.  I don't think the turbo would work if I drew the same with it as I do with the stock stem."

(Thanks to ItOughtaBeLegal for that reference.)  Ploom's almost admitting the Pax was long overdue for improvements but still hasn't really done much to make the Pax 2 compete with newer vapes that are easier to use/maintain, give better vapor, and are less overpriced (Plooms' margin is just crazy, but they do pay for more advertisements than the competitors who are busy innovating.).  Most sellers will avoid saying anything to diminish the money they make off the more profit heavy vapes, but really honest ones will tell you that there's much better vapes for a more honest price.   If you do see someone who swears the Pax/Pax2 are the best regardless of price, ask them how it compares on:   vapor taste (glass on glass/convection rocks conduction) consistent vaping (conduction requires stirring to get even without overcooking) ease of use (lots of competitors are suck to load/blow to clear!) ease of maintenance (Pax has the highest maintenence needs) reclaim (the 'crap that breaks my Pax' is hash oil. Pure lovely hashoil. Do you want to smoke it or hate it? With other vapes, like the solo/air, you reclaim this oil, and it's awesome vs. breaking your vape. In fact I don't know many vapes that die when you need them the most like the Pax.) direct USB charging (lots of competitors can do it) direct power adapter (Same. Old feature. Why can't the Pax/2 do this? Why would I want to use my battery while I'm near power?) use while charging (Can't do this with Pax and I dunno about Pax 2 but since they ignored the long list of issues with the Pax I assume this is also broken on Pax 2?)   There's a ton more small points that are niche uses for competing products, like how easily you can add a bubbler/hookup a bong, and options for supporting those uses. Also the fact that Ploom still doesn't let you swap the battery. Long term owners have realized the Pax warranty actually makes you their bitch and you have to pay them for the privilege of being without a vape for a bit while you send your unit out for a battery that won't be competitively priced. With competing vapes you can not only swap the battery, you can have spares and upgraded batteries with more power. Also a few lifetime warranty vapes out there too. Not just 10yrs.  When you want to go portable you shouldn't have to pack some iso, some pipe cleaner, a charging dock, and some VG lube to ensure your vape works without clogging/jamming. It should just be you, the vape, and your bud. Why fight with the product you paid so much for?  BUT BUT BUT.. It PLAYS SIMON SAYS!!?! .. Show me any motion sensor equipped cell phone that doesn't play better games and I'll agree this is something interesting. You can't tell me this is a feature the competition is scrambling to add to real good vapes."

It's easy to use, powerful, efficient.   You won't believe the amount of cloud you can get from this little beast with very little quantity of herb.  Which is nice since the mflb is also great to conserve herb.  I didn't want to end up with a vaporizer which need at least 0.1g or something to vape properly.  I made the transition from MFLB+PA to E-Nano and I love it.  Someone who only used the mflb will enjoy temperature control.  Your abv can end up, with some mixing between a couple of tokes, at a very nice even color of your choice.  I prefer medium brown but I'm experimenting a lot with different temperature.

vaporents,3dlgwh,2cone,9,Fri Jul 17 20:12:16 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there's plenty of better ways to do it but what I did was blast the ABV, take the BHO from that and decarboxylate it (yeah I know ABV is probably mostly activated already but who knows I use a convection vape and it isn't actually in contact with heat for all that long) and then mix it with coconut oil. I used 10 grams of coconut oil for every gram of BHO.  Came out to roughly 72mg a cap. I'd probably make fewer caps and make them more potent if I did it over again but my tolerance is stupid."

vaporents,3dlgwh,WhyAreYouSoJealous,11,Fri Jul 17 09:59:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't yet made AVB caps but I plan to soon once I gather enough AVB. This is copy/paste from my own notes that I gathered that may help. Of course, there's different ways of making it, this guide is what works for me:  MAKING AVB CAPS   Weigh the (unground) AVB on a scale and measure out about 5ml of coconut oil per 1g of AVB. Note: There is 15ml in 1 tbsp. Then, put the correct amount of coconut oil into an empty mason jar. Put the mason jar in a slow cooker (without a lid), put the lid on top of the slow cooker, and then turn on the slow cooker to its lowest temperature setting. Finely grind the AVB. Once the coconut oil in the mason jar is melted, add the ground AVB to the warm coconut oil. Then, put the lid back on top of the slow cooker. Leave the slow cooker on for 3 to 4 hours (stirring occasionally). After 4 hours, turn off the slow cooker and let the mason jar and its contents cool down (until room temperature, or else overnight). Strain the cooled ABV-infused oil through cheesecloth (folded 3 to 4 times over) into another scent-free container (e.g. another mason jar), and then close the lid on the container to reduce scent. Use a cap filler kit and a plastic syringe to fill empty gelatin (not vegetarian) capsules with the ABV-infused oil, close the capsules, and then gently wipe the capsules clean. I should fill each capsule to about 75% of capacity. Once you have filled all the caps that you are able to fill, store the finished AVB caps in a pill bottle (or a closed mason jar) inside of a fridge.   I bought this cap filler kit which includes empty gel caps."

vaporents,3dlgwh,Smokeswaytoomuch,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:35:48 2015 UTC,"You can make the capsule oil out of AVB + coconut oil so it should work via pot on stove method.

Check around Reddit to see how many grams per tablespoon of coconut oil other users used when making their AVB caps. I have written in my notes (grabbed from a user on Reddit, I can't remember who though) that I should use about 5ml of coconut oil per 1g of AVB. Note: There is 15ml in 1 tbsp."
vaporents,3dlgwh,levelt8t,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:07:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I was wondering how many ml goes into the capsule, but i guess it depends on size of the capsule. basically i was trying to break down the formula for smaller batches. So instead of using 10oz like op, Maybe 10g of avb so that would be 50ml of coconut oil. How many capsules would that make? that cap kit that was linked didn't specify size of the capsules and the only ones i can find in Australia are way different and more expensive."

A gram to a ml is fairly strong and you can certainly up those amounts of shatter to fluid for stronger or lighter to your taste.

vaporents,3dmzfl,norway_is_awesome,3,Fri Jul 17 19:05:50 2015 UTC,For new vape users it is hard to go wrong with the E-Nano. It has few bells and whistles and certainly not the cheapest vape on the market but it is easy and reliable.
vaporents,3dmzfl,howie105,3,Fri Jul 17 17:22:37 2015 UTC,It has a pretty basic price tag when compared to all desktop vaporizers.

vaporents,3dmzfl,howie105,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:57:29 2015 UTC,"here's some vapes i'd get if price wasn't a factor:  Sublimator, Minivap, Evo, Mighty, Pax 2  and here are some economical alternatives i use instead:  VHW, Herbalaire, Lotus, Solo, Alfa  (the total cost of these vapes is less than the sublimator alone)"
vaporents,3dmzfl,Yooosh,2,Fri Jul 17 18:41:14 2015 UTC,"Most people are buying the Sublimator for around $540. The sum of all those vapes are definitely more than that.  http://www.planetvape.ca/sublimator-xlr-2.0-adapt-a-sub-apollo-kit.html  I honestly see the Sublimator as being cheaper than the Cloud Evo. At least with the Sublimator you have 100% use (concentrates + flower) for $540 plus the cost of any DHgate glass (so call it $600).  To do dabs with the Evo you would also need to also buy the VapexNail and a hydratube (because you can't use the  evo inverted with a nail). This comes out to over $700 easily, maybe even over $800"

vaporents,3dmzfl,belayzee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:05:41 2015 UTC,"Sum of the vapes was ~$600 (thanks to ebay/coupons) but you're right, I was referring to the whole Sub setup with the bong. I figure I might as well try the full kit if I'm ponying up.   All good points, I agree with you. Especially for concentrates. Evo is cool, and way more newbie-friendly but I love the one-hitter nature of the Sub. Plus hitting flowers+wax at the same time sounds awesome. But I just don't have space for that setup + crazy dog etc. I'm also concerned I'd blow my tolerance quickly. Still...someday  Do you own a sub? What ya think?"
vaporents,3dmzfl,Yooosh,2,Sat Jul 18 02:44:02 2015 UTC,"Yes I own a Sub and an Evo. I call the Sub Mike Tyson because it knocks me out. The Sub is my favorite vape because I am a former bong smoker and my style was always killing the entire bowl in one hit. Like any other vape, there are a few disadvantages I have seen since owning it:   As you mentioned, it's not newbie friendly. This is more a device that belongs on a work bench than in a living room. I actually have a scar from a burn I received the first night using it. I had a few drinks and my dog caught the cord running around the table, heater came in contact with my forearm for about .1 seconds and the mark will probably be there forever. I keep it on a shelf now and it doesn't move from there (you go to it). My friends make fun of it and call it the ""Sub station"" The thing can get you to higher than any other vape, but that's not a good thing for everyone. I have had people get sick and puke from getting too high. And I mean people, not person. Lol. This is not a vape I really like to hit before going out. I get a little anti social/anxious and can end up in some weird head space when I get that high The titanium version takes like 20-30 minutes to heat up and it has a one hour off timer. That is pretty fucking annoying, especially if you just got home and want to rip it, you turn it on and gotta wait 30 minutes. Then something might occupy you and you forget, come back and it shut itself off and you have to wait again.    I probably hit the sub about every day when I come home from work and don't plan on going out. Much more often though I would rather just be at a 6-8 rather than a hard 10, I'll go with my Evo. That vape can also get you to a 10 easily as well but on many more rips, so you can have more control over your experience. My complaint about the Evo would be that I have already spent about $500 on it and I still can't do concentrates without paying another $300-$400. I wish some DHGate sellers would start cloning the hydratubes!  BTW I wouldn't recommend the ""whole sub setup"" if you are talking about this thing because the whip really ruins the experience. Adds a ridiculous amount of draw resistance, eliminates the one hitter nature of the vape, and can't be used with water. I think they are really dumb for selling that kit, no one that I know actually uses it like that and it is helping to promote this whole ""the sub is the most expensive vape on the market"" misnomer. The biggest criticism that I have about this company is it seems like they have no idea how to market a product. There is no manual that I know of, it comes in an unlabeled brown box (ZERO branding), and looks confusing as hell when trying to figure out what kit works for you. I spent way too much time trying to figure out, do i need the whip kit? Adapt-a-bong kit? Dabmaster? Apollo? The answer I settled on was the XLR 2.0 Adapt-a-Sub Apollo Titanium kit. No regrets on that purchase"
vaporents,3dmzfl,belayzee,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:22:04 2015 UTC,How is the alfa BTW ? I've been eyeing it as an on the go vape but there's not too many reviews on it :0
vaporents,3dmzfl,itsiliii,2,Fri Jul 17 23:14:40 2015 UTC,i love it.  ive tried every conduction vape besides the pax 2 and the alfa is my favorite along with the vapman (which serves a different purpose)  i like the bowl design with center pin. avb is consistent. you can pack a little or a ton in there if youd like. won't really impede airflow. produces huge clouds and tastes great. you can also connect the mouthpiece to 14mm glass. battery lasts 4-5 bowls.  one big reason its my favorite portable vape is the auto features. having the vape step up in temp based off time or puffs is really convenient imo. keeps me from getting all fiddly.   you can get it on vapornation for well under 200 with the fc21 code. cheers! :)

vaporents,3dmzfl,obamaNOgymkhana,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:06:32 2015 UTC,vapor quality is not price dependent. A Lotus can produce vapor that will rival any vaporizer at any price.

vaporents,3dnsa9,hauntedape,3,Fri Jul 17 19:49:13 2015 UTC,"+1 to the silicone tubing.  Definitely the biggest day-to-day improvement I've made to mine.  I went with the 7th floor water pipe adapter for mine (the blue looks killer with the under-lights on, and black tubing), I don't know if it's any smaller than their other offerings, but it was a noticeable flow improvement over the elbow that came with the EQ.  I made the inline bubbler for about $10 worth of hobby lobby junk.  If you've got the dough, the Magic Flight Orbiter is much nicer, and my source of inspiration to build the contraption in the picture.  It could look nicer if I spent more on the parts (Particularly the top/plug) but it works wonders.  As for the valve mouthpiece, I wouldn't bother.  Having a water bubbler 100% prevents the issue, but honestly, just laying your whip down on the table below the level of the bowl pretty much eliminates any passive vapor loss.  Since the bowl is kept hot, and heat rises, as long as your whip is not on an incline from one end to the other, the vapor will just gather at the highest point and stagnate until you hit it.  The EQ works via convection however, and there is nearly zero vapor formation when you aren't actively drawing on the whip or running the fan.  Overall it's a non-issue that I wouldn't even bother addressing.  Hopefully some of this is useful to you, and feel free to hit me up if you've got any questions, I love talking shop!"

Unless there is vapor coming out of the mouthpiece, you're really not losing anything, or not enough to bother stressing over anyway.

vaporents,3do8wu,stripe2800,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:38:06 2015 UTC,"If you had a super manky stem sure! It'd be no different than loading a chamber with concentrate, but obviously a lot, lot less of it. And any condensate that's not right in the chamber won't be vaped as it wouldn't get hot enough (oily solo stem for instance)"
vaporents,3do8wu,roythehamster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:03:58 2015 UTC,"I agree. and, exhale, then take a breath or two of air, and hit the vape again. So I'm inhaling fairly quickly I suppose. While I'm not hitting it, vapor is being produced and resting in the chamber. Sometimes if I wait 10-15 seconds before a hit, it will be a little thicker than normal. As long as vaporizer is not coming out of any holes, you're not losing anything. Since it's becoming vapor and expanding, if you wait too long between hits it will start to seep out."
vaporents,3do8wu,ShitSnacks2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:41:59 2015 UTC,"Essentially, yes. It's really on demand manual vape vs automatic session vape. Something like the Ascent is a constant cooker, and it leaks from top (and sometimes bottom or sides too). Sure some oil build up but its not the same and it will pour out the mouthpiece unless your on top of it. If you set it and don't inhale you will have wasted a lot of herb, with any session conduction vape."
vaporents,3do8wu,ShitSnacks2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I really don't like the sound of that. Will probably avoid conduction vapes then."

It's kinda like pipe vs joint bascially (in a constant cooking way, not an effects way).  The caveat is a vape like mflb or even better the Vapman (new Peace by Triihouse too), on demand conduction vapes. Not very common, but a bit better than session conduction at least, and those torch ones hit hard I've been told"

I would recommend the Goboof Alfa, performs similarly from what I've been to told to the Original Pax. Conduction heating so it does hit you hard, and based off my experience with converting people desktops and conduction seem to good for people who are just transitioning to vaping from  smoking. You can pick it up from Puffitup.com for $199 plus free shipping.   Depending how heavy of a smoker you are, the transition may be different. I had no problems, infact I got way higher than I ever did after ripping bongs for 2 years everyday. But I've heard of people having issues getting medicated after the transisition. If you're a daily toker and you aren't having good results take a couple days off from the herb, and you'll be amazed at a much better part of cannabis after using your vape. :)  For reference I went through about 1-2 grams a day when I smoked. I vape .2 on normal weekday after work, and about .4 on a weekend or a day off of work."

However if you want to and many people do just take a couple steps to keep yourself safe from neighbors, DA, managers, etc.  Make sure you have a towel under the door, some kind of fan that is big enough to move a large volume of air AWAY from the main entrance point preferably into an open window. A carbon activated sploof will also eliminate any smell from exhaling, a smoke buddy or homemade doesn't matter, just make sure you have some kind of carbon filter. Also Ozium before and after will mask any smell of herb or the physical vape heating up. Be sure to store anything cannabis related in a airtight container, I've been surprised when people smelt weed and it was just a baggy I had on me..."

vaporents,3dnuqf,LenTheSimpleton,2,Fri Jul 17 20:07:12 2015 UTC,"Can't explain the circuit boards, but the rest depends on the vape.  The Paxes use a kind of conductive tape wrapped around the oven. The Solo uses a little ceramic disc stuck to the bottom of the metal bowl. The MFLB uses the screen to complete an electrical circuit, heating the screen. The E-Nano uses a ceramic rod in a metal tube - cool air enters through the bottom of the tube and comes out hot. The Cloud Evo's heating element wraps around a glass tube with a bamboo-like restriction at the center. Etc."

Not saying it's impossible to learn, but that's a lot of information. On top of that, all vaporizers are different so they do things differently.    like how heat is transferred to the bowls using conduction and convection   Are you asking about the physics  of the heat transfer? Or the internal design? I don't know enough about vaporizers to really give you any answers you're looking for.   I've been thinking about trying to build my own vape to learn how they work though. I don't know if you know what an enail is, but I built one from scratch and it gave me a more detailed understanding."

vaporents,3dlt8w,techiebabe,3,Fri Jul 17 08:46:35 2015 UTC,"Screens are essential for proper function of most vapes. I'm not familiar with the Storm but most vapes lose a lot of power when their screens get gunked with oil after use. You can clean them by soaking them overnight in some isopropol alcohol and giving them a rinse under hot water. I would change them at least once a week. A certain grinder is not a necessity. Some people use a clean coin in a small pill bottle or small scissors in a shot glass. Any local head shop will sell you an OK grinder. Some have multiple levels or screens for separating bud from keifs. Some have cranks. Some have magnets. Some are plastic. It really doesn't matter, spend what you feel is justifiable for your budget. A bubbler is a small bong, used to filter your vapor through water. I'm not sure what's best for your storm but it looks like vapefiend sells a bubbler bundle with a special mouthpiece/adapter and the PWNT. The bubbler definitely makes it look more unwieldy / less stealthy but probably doesn't affect the odor much.   Have you figured out the best draw technique?"
vaporents,3dlt8w,aeburnside,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:37:38 2015 UTC,"This is really helpful, thanks!   Draw technique? Well I've found what works for me at different temps...does it vary according to the individual / vape or am I missing something?   I saw the storm bubbler add on, just really trying to work out if it's something I need / would use. Thanks!   And thanks so much for the info on cleaning screens and grinders. I appreciate it. Hopefully I won't be a newbie forever & can then help others in future :)"
vaporents,3dlt8w,SmokeWeedErrdayWoo,3,Fri Jul 17 22:32:01 2015 UTC,A space case grinder is insanely good if you're prepared to spend the money.

vaporents,3dlt8w,truesoul42,2,Fri Jul 17 22:38:19 2015 UTC,I bought a 4 piece aluminum $6 grinder off ebay and works great.
vaporents,3dlt8w,truesoul42,3,Fri Jul 17 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"I used to do that until my friend donated me his space case. And damn what a difference. Way easier to use, more consistent grinding, and since its a 2 piece, I can get ultra fine pieces with it, and better vapor. Sure a cheap grinder works if you hold it upside down and use it for a while, but if you have the money its nice to have a better one."

vaporents,3dnp8n,HikaruEyre,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:00:38 2015 UTC,"I would suggest the Lotus. You use a torch to heat a metal plate that air passes by entering the chamber, so it's convection. The J-hook config comes with the WPA chamber. You can always make other stems using the WPA, like out of wood or glass, or use with a glass piece. You also never have to worry about battery strength. I have a few vapes but the Lotus is my daily driver because it's so reliable and easy to move around the house with. I use it with the MF Orbiter now but preferred the j-hook over the aluminum stem.  http://www.lotusvaporizer.com/node/313  http://www.vapecritic.com/vaporizers/lotus/"

Vapor production is massive, battery life is great (I've gone about 2.5 hours straight and several grams without charging in one sitting), and the mouthpiece can be used to make stem milk (or hot chocolate as I prefer).

vaporents,3dl76b,truesoul42,2,Fri Jul 17 04:30:09 2015 UTC,"I recently switched to it from the mflb. I was getting some weird chest pain when using the mflb and it went away when I moved to the firewood. I wish the battery life was a little longer but one full charge lasts me just about full days use (5 or 6 sessions). I like that it is uncommon and unbranded. It integrated very easily into my daily life, I would definitely recommend it."
vaporents,3dl76b,Vaporoflife,2,Fri Jul 17 04:37:26 2015 UTC,I think it is the worst vape I owned. Vapor production is really weak
vaporents,3dl76b,roythehamster,2,Fri Jul 17 06:02:37 2015 UTC,"Really? I think it makes a ton of vapor, as long as the battery is charged and not old. I developed a technique where I would hit it as slowly as possible. I would try to time it so that as my lungs were about to be fully expanded, I would really start needing a fresh breath of air, like 40+ seconds of constant, slow inhaling. It got me insanely fat clouds."
vaporents,3dl76b,Vaporoflife,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"What can I say? Compared to even Iolite, it performs much worse than any vape I've tried in terms of vapor production, learning curve, realibility etc. It's simple a huge hassle to use and if a vaporizer is sold with the slogan: ""If you don't like it, you are doing it wrong"". Something is obviously wrong with the product design. '  I know it's an unpopular opinion to have someone come in and say negative things about the vaporizer that is celebrated with a photo. But someone has to stop the circlejerk and actually point out flaws in the vaporizers being advertised in here. I fell for the firewood circlejerk and was extremely disappointed."
vaporents,3dl76b,roythehamster,2,Sat Jul 18 11:01:49 2015 UTC,"Your'e right, it's not as good as people say. I've found it to be very effective though, but to each his own. Is the Iolite your daily chugger? I've never tried one of those."

But I found it to be very slow in it's extraction. A proper session would take close to 15 minutes. It also had an annoying sound as it went through the gas. MFLB is a lot better."
vaporents,3dl76b,unceunceunce,0,Sun Jul 19 11:17:31 2015 UTC,"Practice with it more. My brother always has the same issue because he doesn't hold down the trigger long enough. The Firewood basically has limitless potential to the point of combustion because it's fully convection and will get as hot as you allow it.  Also, if you can hear the air moving through the air hole while you're inhaling you're drawing too fast.   Try a few sessions inhaling slower, starting off with a 30 second trigger hold, and continue holding the trigger the entire first hit. From there I usually hold the trigger about 5 seconds before each hit and go by taste after that."
vaporents,3dl76b,Vaporoflife,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:00:12 2015 UTC,"I have been able to produce a lot of vapor and creep all the way up to combustion. The problem is that even though it creates vapor, it's not really potent at all. Visible vapor does not equal potent vapor. Compared to Arizer Solo, MFLB, INH05 and Crafty this is just a toy."
vaporents,3dl76b,unceunceunce,0,Sat Jul 18 10:58:06 2015 UTC,"I have had the exact opposite experience, and what you are saying doesn't really make sense in how vapes work. Maybe the Firewood holds less than those others and you aren't accounting for that, but vapor is vapor and if your avb looks the same coming out of the Firewood as it does the other vapes you mentioned its been vaped just as well."
vaporents,3dl76b,Vaporoflife,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:57:56 2015 UTC,"You are missing one thing. Say that the heater in Firewood can reach 230 degrees, but once you start hitting it (even really slowly), the temperature degrades and you get one second of vapor created at 230 degrees and the rest created at 210-200-190-180. Surely the AVB will be scorched, but the vapor you experienced is not nearly as potent as from a vaporizer that is able to maintain the temperature.   The instructions themselves give it away. ""Draw as slow as possible, if you are not experiencing satisfying vapor production, you're not drawing slow enough"". This is because the heating element in the Firewood is not nearly powerful enough. It is simply because battery technology is not powerful enough to give enough power to give decent pure convection performance in a portable yet. Even Storz & Bickel had to compromize with their Mighty and Crafty and make it a combination of convection and conduction.   Another example: AVB from Arizer Solo at 210 degrees is usually darker than cashed AVB from a Volcano at 230. Surely you will not argue that the Solo is creating more potent vapor than the Volcano?"

""Draw as slow as possible, if you are not experiencing satisfying vapor production, you're not drawing slow enough"". This is because the heating element in the Firewood is not nearly powerful enough.    So draw slower and keep holding down the trigger? ~30 second long continuously slow drags give me huge clouds comparable to my log.    It is simply because battery technology is not powerful enough to give enough power to give decent pure convection performance in a portable yet. Even Storz & Bickel had to compromize with their Mighty and Crafty and make it a combination of convection and conduction.

I recently took a 5 day tolerance break with my roommate (doesn't sound like much, but both my roommate and I are habitual MJ users), and then packed a normal bowl in my Plenty vaporizer. We both passed out an hour after vaping lol. We tried our normal sized bowl 3 nights in a row after and got knocked out each time. Good times. Once we realized we can't tank the amount we used to, we cut back. I had forgotten how ""zany"" the weed high can be with a normal tolerance. I was telling my desk fan to frig off (literally couldn't handle the way it was blowing air onto my arm), letting my cat explore the top reaches of the cupboard so I could watch, stuff like that. I have to do t breaks more often!! For reference, we'd go through an ounce in 6 days before we switched to vaping, and now a half ounce will last us 6-9 days."

vaporents,3dlprp,hauntedape,2,Fri Jul 17 15:44:49 2015 UTC,"Personally I say the ascent is just an all around upgrade. The glass is better. The loading is easier, it holds more (as someone said that can be a negative but with glass spacers its fine, also DaVinci just released an official glass piece for the bowl, not sure how that works). Cleaning the ascent is waaaay easier than the original and the battery for the ascent lasts much longer than the original. The downsides of the ascent though is I think it does get noticeably hotter, and I think the original does wax better."
vaporents,3dlprp,Yaroze,2,Fri Jul 17 19:42:02 2015 UTC,"Ascent. Simply because I don't own the original. So I can't really comment.  I love my ascent, its so far my first and only vape and once you picked up the knack of it, its a impressive toy. I got mine last September and still going strong, and it's been dropped many of times.  Cleaning is nice, get a Q-Tip, dip it in ISO and just wipe the bowl clean. Pull out the glass stem and glass tube, throw it in a bag of ISO and vola! Nice and clean.  Taste is awesome. Ascent can stink, so it's not the stealthy. The device does look as it's form the 80's but this doesn't bother me.  Weight is as heavy as an 360 Controller, no issue here.  The bowl is big, but there are ways to work around this and they have just released spacers too! Make sure you pack tight. You can even use one of the jar's that come with it.  The temperature control is a treat. Seriously the high at 400F is completely different then at 360F   I would personally say Ascent."

vaporents,3dlprp,roxyvapes,2,Fri Jul 17 12:57:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry about that mate. I find the vapor quality it produces is better, the build quality is much more rugged, the bowl is much smaller which can is better for efficiency. The ascents bowl is .9g and only sees good results when fully packed (or using a glass spacer) and for me anyways, that's far too large for a session. If you're using it with friends sure that's fine, but I think the convenience of the OG Davinci far outweighs the ascents aesthetic appeal. It's got the storage chamber inside the unit for extra buds (at least 4 ovens worth) and a cleaning brush storage compartment too. Easy to mate with a waterpipe, super stealthy looking, I dunno, it just fits my needs well and may fit yours. I've used both many times and much prefer the original."

I strongly recommend you return it and buy a more reliable and reputable desktop or portable vape. A lot of the comments also said it had a burning wire taste, and that it created smoke with no herb loaded in it. This just sounds like another cheap Chinese vape that produces plastic fumes, and is not healthy. There are many vapes that are better and cheaper than this one."
vaporents,3dl16n,truesoul42,2,Fri Jul 17 04:57:30 2015 UTC,ugh I guess I should have asked you guys first. What would you recommend for around the price range? Should I just save up a bit more and get a Volcano since atleast I know they work
vaporents,3dl16n,truesoul42,2,Fri Jul 17 05:17:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah a volcano is a great choice if you can save up, but it only works with bags. Some good desktop vapes around 200 are the Silver Surfer Vape, Da Buddha Vape, Life Saber Vape, E-nano, underdog, and arizer EQ (with some mods that are easy to do). Or you can definitely save up for a volcano which is top of the line, but expensive.  Some portables for under 200 are the arizer air and goboof alfa, and the crafty at $288 and mighty for $340."

That's the one point I heard was best about it, that it's a really full extraction.  I can dig the external pump hassle.  How's the taste eq vs h2.2? Is the h2.2 a lot of conduction?"
vaporents,3dl16n,truesoul42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:29:36 2015 UTC,"The efficiency is low imo because it takes  a LOT of herb to get good vapor, kind of like the plenty, and it goes through it fast. I ended up use twice as much herb to get to the same level of high when compared to the EQ.   The taste is about the same as the EQ, both are very good. The EQ blows bags faster, is more efficient at the same temp, and gives you better vapor at lower temps."

A glass or whip vape is better than a bag vape. If you really want to save up and get something nicer, make it a cloud evo."

vaporents,3dlgsv,Frostiestone,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:16:14 2015 UTC,Haze
vaporents,3dlgsv,ShitSnacks2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:52:02 2015 UTC,"Pretty much any pen all in one like that is lying.  Best 3in1 is Haze, but pen-esque vapes the xmax v2 pro and (separate conpany but similar naming) the v2 pro 3 series/7 series kinda can too. There are some other so-so options, and many herbal vapes can be used for both with cotton and such. Very few concentrate vapes though can do herb (despite their claims, most combust)"
vaporents,3dlgsv,ShitSnacks2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:19:21 2015 UTC,Recommendations? A guy said Haze but it's so pricey!
vaporents,3dlgsv,ShitSnacks2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"Then check the v2 pro series 3 or 7, gonna have to get separate carts though. Also sold as quickdraw something or other. The xmax is cheap but might need to go with their Storm rebrand from Vapefiend bc he modified the concentrate cups for better performance.  I have next to none experience with conetrates btw, an all in one thats cheap and really works well for all 3 is basically non existant though.  Also depending on the model,can find Haze cheaper than retail many places. Takes a lot of research but $100 or less usually gets you crap still at this point. Gotta research and shop around of those are important to you. Fuckcombustion is the best resource, portables and thread candidates"

I've had one for a while now with no problems, and I've only heard good things about the new version (which I have). However, if this is mostly for home use, I'd go with the air.  But you said you wanted a few tokes at a time. The air is a session vape, meaning its beat if you finish the whole bowl at once (around 0.1g). If you want a good on-demand vape, check out the firefly, you can take the occasional toke here and there with it, but it requires technique and practice, which can get annoying. It's battery life is also pretty subpar, but the batteries are interchangeable."

vaporents,3dle1v,truesoul42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:57:30 2015 UTC,"If you stop the air after only a few tokes, you end up wasting a bunch of herb during the heating and cooling portions. And the next time you use it, the vapor wont be nearly as strong. That's why there's on demand vapes like the mflb, and firefly that let you take a hit or two at a time."

vaporents,3dle1v,truesoul42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:22:52 2015 UTC,"If you put too little herb in the stem, you'll get little to no vapor and be wasting it. I recommend filling the stem all the way and tamping it lightly (0.1g) and that will give you 15 good hits, and a bunch of light ones."

If I had the choice to get the ascent or the air, just from seeing pictures and reviews, I would go for the air.

vaporents,3dizpd,Metaweed,4,Thu Jul 16 17:34:41 2015 UTC,After looking around the site it seems you are short on mods there seems to be a number of thinly veiled advertisements posing as legitimate posts. For example on this page http://vaporizer-info.com/en/vaporizer/zephyr-ion the post titled in part 6 Month Loans 6monthloansforunemployed. Of course its your site so you get to do whatever you think is right.
vaporents,3dizpd,howie105,3,Thu Jul 16 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"Yea that should not be allowed.  The review was taken from the actual review they seemed to give it, but the numbers do not add up.  We have a report section included for situations like this.  This remove has been removed as it should not represent the review on that product.  The spam review they have on their is more than 8 months old....  The premise of the site is reviews can be faked and skewed all the time, but using multiple inputs from different people helps to give a clearer picture and helps to find a reviewer that you have a similar opinion with.  So while I do not agree with all reviews on rotten tomatoes there are a select few I feel have the same mentality as me.   TLDR - Spam should not be allowed, reviewer removed :)"
vaporents,3dizpd,truesoul42,8,Thu Jul 16 19:48:41 2015 UTC,"Missing: Arizer air, goboof alfa, the rest of the flowermates, xmax v2, titan 2, herbstick eco, lily, grasshopper, and probably more.  Also, I disagree with a bunch of your ratings, and I think you should make dry herb vapes and wax vapes into two separate pages."
vaporents,3dizpd,BongRipsPalin,2,Thu Jul 16 18:10:40 2015 UTC,"Sounds good I will double check on those, and add any missing.  One problem that does seem to come about is name brands.  Comapnies sell the same vaporizer but rebrand it under a different name so you have 20 of the same vaporizer all called something different (the titan series is known for that).  I think the best way to fix that is to just have one critic review score that is pulled from one vaporizer page.  So all the titan brands will be shown but only critics reviews will be added to the titan and then all those rebranded versions will just have on score that says this is a rebranded vaporizer click here for the original version with critic reviews. The ratings are created from other sites to give people an overall impression by critics, but some ratings are always lacking because a overall lack of any reviews on the product.  We are always scouring for more ratings to give the best overall impression.  A good example is the loose leaf cera really only has one review out there which praises it at 100%.  We might work it to be that you need over 5 or 10 critic reviews before your review is shown. Actually its already included but some vaporizers need more info added.  Here's how. Step 1 - Go to the vaporizers page http://www.metaweed.com/vaporizer Step 2 - At the top of the page you will see a bunch of drop down sections. Step 3 - Click on the one that says vapes. Step 4 - Select what type of product you are looking for in terms of vapes.  You can selet herbs, oils, herbs and oils, or cartridges.     Thank you for the feedback though I really appreciate it."
vaporents,3dizpd,BongRipsPalin,6,Thu Jul 16 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"I think requiring a certain number of reviews before the score is shown is a good idea. Or, take the metacritic style percentage out entirely and just let people read over the linked reviews. They don't seem to jive well with the consensus on places like here or FC."
vaporents,3dizpd,chevyfried,3,Thu Jul 16 18:32:53 2015 UTC,The problem with no score system at all is it would seem to make people waste far too much time checking out every vaporizer if they are after a consensus on what is regarding by many as worthwhile vs what is not.    There are some REALLY bad vaporizers out there that deserve low scores and it helps people understand that.  Then again a lot of vaporizers are great but someone seeing a 5 % difference might make them believe one vaporizer is leaps and bounds above another.  I was thinking of adding what rottentomatoes does with the whole fresh or not system.  So next to reviews a specialized icon is added which dictates this product is worth purchasing based on the critics overall impression.  Also another thought was added a critics consensus which is a quick few sentences stating what the top 2 pros about this vaporizer are and the top 2 cons are based on what critics say.  Thoughts?
vaporents,3dizpd,chevyfried,2,Thu Jul 16 18:51:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a tricky balance to find, I'm sure. I think the fresh or not system would be a good idea. I know that some sites will weight reviews differently based on how credible the source is considered, so that would be another option, although one that I could see being a pain in the ass to implement. It's tricky since there are a lot of bad reviews out there and not that many well established and respected reviewers for vapes yet.  I think the quick pros and cons list is a great idea if it can be done easily. There are too many variables at play with this kind of thing to make universal suggestions most of the time."
vaporents,3dizpd,aeburnside,3,Thu Jul 16 19:16:20 2015 UTC,Yea well I think a good way would be a 3 system then.    Critics.  Featured Critics. (Select critics are the cream of the crop and are well established)  Users   Then allow people to only show featured critics and those review scores.  This would help to condense critics.  Ill save this idea for another feature to add in our list of things to add.
vaporents,3dizpd,aeburnside,2,Thu Jul 16 19:54:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely separate wax vs dry herb.  They are very different in operation and use, and have their own followings respectively."
vaporents,3dizpd,chevyfried,3,Thu Jul 16 19:29:51 2015 UTC,"They are separated from oil and herbs as stated in number 3 above :).  So you can easily view only waxes or only herbs.  Or products that can do both.    The goal is to make the site VERY easy to use for people who have little to no clue on the cannabis community, but at the same able to be heavily sorted for those that are more seasoned veterans."
vaporents,3dizpd,chevyfried,2,Thu Jul 16 19:56:16 2015 UTC,HAHAHAHA G-Pro got 92%?!?!?!  And why is the Ploom Model 2 on there?  It's for tobacco.
vaporents,3dizpd,Chuckl8899,2,Thu Jul 16 19:23:51 2015 UTC,"HAHAHAHA G-Pro got 92%?!?!?!   Yea it was given that from multiple sites and critics being included.  We are always after more critics if you know ones missed to give a better impression, as the more websites and critics included the more informed someone can be.  I assume someone will see the rating then look at the product and view all the different reviews listed by critics and go from there.   And why is the Ploom Model 2 on there? It's for tobacco.   It is SUPER easy to fab to work with vaping.  While its primary function is for tobacco.  A lot of people use it for cannabis.  Here are some videos for you.  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ploom+model+two+herbs&search=Search"
vaporents,3dizpd,ShitSnacks2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:01:55 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you're going to include things, that when modded, can turn into vapes? That's an impossibly long list."
vaporents,3dizpd,ShitSnacks2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:34:35 2015 UTC,"Well some caution is needed, but I actually know two people personally who got a ploom as a gift and use it as a means to vape herbs with.  Its literally just using herbs and some vegetable glycerine.  At the same time I would hate to have the site flooded with every e-cig under the sun just because you can technically put wax in it, but it works poorly.  At the same time some e-cig companies spend millions to create pens that can work with waxes and/or herbs so why exclude them from someone looking for information on purchasing a new device, or information in general.  A middle ground is needed there.  Maybe under type of vaporizer have it be mobile, dekstop, (modified e-cigs), and then only limit it to top brands.  Thoughts?"
vaporents,3dizpd,ShitSnacks2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:46:27 2015 UTC,Use a limited number of trusted reviewers to populate the site. Try to form a consensus from those trusted reviews and exclude any vapes that aren't reviewed by your trusted reviewers. Maybe then add user reviews for those plus other popular models? (think rotten tomatoes' critic vs audience %ages)
vaporents,3dizpd,patthekidd,2,Thu Jul 16 21:08:29 2015 UTC,"Yea the thing is I think people want to leave their own reviews too.  So keeping the user reviews would be good.    Also removing new vaporizers completely or ones that are not well known because of a lack of reviews makes it hard for those just after basic information.  What about keeping all critic scores that have at least x reviews from trusted critics.  So I can just code it to show the review if it has x reviews from trusted critics, and if there are not x reviews from critics text will be displayed stating this product does no have enough any or x amount trusted critic reviews to give a reliable score for?  Great ideas by the way, thanks for sharing them."
vaporents,3dl5ib,Wholigan425,2,Fri Jul 17 03:56:44 2015 UTC,"it just looks like another one of those rebranded vapes, like the one kandypens offers, or cloud v. It doesn't actually vape dry herb since it has a heating coil in it."

vaporents,3dkd0n,whyisntitlegal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:42:33 2015 UTC,Paid two hundred for it new. Like it for stealth (can go from flower to ejuice with flip of switch) and portability. Being able to load several cans in morning so you're good for day. Easy for frients to use. Batteries are user swappable and relatively fast charging. ..two will get single user through day. Decent taste. Efficient. Can either do just few draws or be session vape.  Drawbacks.. Doesn't do water well. Slow to get you past 6/7  My haze is my out and about on a Saturday with the wife vape. Can hit right before movie. ..used it in stall with smoke buddy a couple of weeks ago. Nice to keep the background buzz going. Also nice to pass around at party if we're looking for moderate lift.  It's also nice for what I call buzz maintenance or glide path.. Get hammered on Lotus or UD then use Haze to maintain or come in gradually.

vaporents,3dk9zi,truesoul42,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:22:52 2015 UTC,"I was unclear, I have been grinding, but I was thinking that was the reason it was clogging (other than the oil) was because it was fine.   Tossing a nug in renders great flavor for longer I feel like. Soooo good!  Thanks for the reply"
vaporents,3dk9zi,Firegivesme,2,Thu Jul 16 23:25:50 2015 UTC,"The screens clog from herb vapor itself after a week or so. Just push it out with something and drop in a dish of iso alcohol.   Order extra screens if you didn't because they get warped after you pop them in and out, then don't stay in place when you stir the bowl  Or get one with a glass screen. I only use my nano with glass now so I have the fixed glass screen gong. Much easier to clean and doesn't clog all the time."
vaporents,3dk9zi,HikaruEyre,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:37:54 2015 UTC,I'm clogging up after a night of fairly heavy use..  I just cut a hole in the lid of some ISO and will pop my stem in each night I think!
vaporents,3dk9zi,HikaruEyre,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:11:39 2015 UTC,I got the stem with the glass screen. You could maybe try a courser screen.

vaporents,3djs06,truesoul42,3,Thu Jul 16 21:10:39 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response.  I'll see if I can find one at a walgreens/cvs but from the looks of their websites they only sell urine tests in the stores.  If I can find one I'll give it a try.

Well I know the real reason is $$$ , but God damnit that things draw restriction looks disgusting. It looks like the user is going to die from the resistance, you can see it in there face and the function of the bong. lol  I did the same thing with my Atmos Raw 2 years ago with my bong resulting in similar results, literally right down to the draw resistance.  I'll hand it to them for not advertising it as a vaporizer though, kudos for that. I'm all for the vapor, but even if I combusted there would be better options for a portable toke imo."

vaporents,3djee9,-ziK-,2,Thu Jul 16 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"The temp control on your e-cig is not the same as the temp control on an herb vaporizer. The iStick temp control requires the use of a special atomizers that use nickel metal for their coils (because the properties of nickel allow for easy temp regulation). You'd have to find some special attachment for your iStick to use it for herb/extract vaping, and from what I've heard/seen those attachments are few and far between and aren't usually good. It's even less likely that you'd find one that's able to take advantage of the temp control on your iStick."

vaporents,3diiws,Packupabowldud3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:17:16 2015 UTC,water pipe needed seperaetly right? sorry pretty new to this haha
vaporents,3diiws,Packupabowldud3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:26 2015 UTC,"Correct. You can use the GonG adapter to attach it to a whip, or a downstem in a waterpipe. Or you can look into a pinnacle hydrotube for that bad boy."
vaporents,3diiws,mwilliams7795,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:49:15 2015 UTC,The only thing I'd say you absolutely need is screens.  They can either be solo specific ones from online or you can get normal pipe screens and cut them down so they fit in the stem. If you ever wanted to hit your piece through a bong a GonG adapter isn't s bad idea either.
vaporents,3diiws,ChromeForty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:31:52 2015 UTC,"Get your screens on eBay, they will cost you like $3 for 100 instead of PlanetVape's screens $4 for 5.  If you're interested, adding water filtration will help you get less harsh and bigger hits. You will need to buy this GonG from PlanetVape. You will need to decide between 14mm and 18mm, take a look at the 3 bubblers I linked, they are cheap, sturdy and perfect for a beginner.  The D020-D is the cheapest thick bubbler you'll find. It has nice diffusion for it's size and you can play with the water level since it has a big volume. (You will need a 18mm to 14mm adapter)  This inline & tree perc to get rid of the harshness but also flavor, it's perfect for the Air because it is a thick 14.5mm, meaning that your included stem will fit perfectly in it without the usual 18mm to 14mm adapter required by most bongs. This is a big bong for vaporization but you can enjoy it like I do without a problem! :)  If you like the more complicated kind to be able to open it all up and clean it well, the atomic perc bubbler one is nice.  (You will need a 18mm to 14mm adapter)"
vaporents,3diiws,Broham13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:07:59 2015 UTC,"OP mentioned a Solo, not an Air, so you'd want 18mm to 18mm, right? I ask for myself."
vaporents,3diiws,ChromeForty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:25:24 2015 UTC,The Air and the Solo both have interchangeable stems. The Air stems fit in the Solo and vise versa :).  It depends what size joint your water pipe has. I bought a 14mm GonG with a 18mm to 14mm adapter and my setup can fit any bong. I use the adapter when I'm using my D020-D but when I'm using my smaller bubblers I take it off.
vaporents,3diiws,Broham13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:51:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks. That makes sense. I'm probably going to get the D020-D, so I need … ?"

vaporents,3diiws,qwerqwert,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:41:37 2015 UTC,I think the high temperature stem caps are worthwhile if you plan on taking it on the go. Lets you prepack stems and put the stem back in its case without worrying about melting stuff.
vaporents,3diiws,LotusKindaSutra,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:58:50 2015 UTC,Only things you need for your Solo:   Screens O-rings  Water pipe Adapter for water pipe (if you don't want to spend more cash then improvise and make your own. I've been using a bottle cap to fit in through my 18mm bong.)   In all honesty the only acceptable way to use your Solo is through a water pipe. It gets me high as hell.

vaporents,3diip9,ecologyofmind,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:26:21 2015 UTC,I will mostly be doing dry sessions. But since you have both what do you think is the most efficient one?
vaporents,3diip9,ecologyofmind,2,Thu Jul 16 23:23:11 2015 UTC,"I think the consensus, and my experience, is that the log vapes such as the  E Nano and UD are the most efficient with the Lotus close behind.. It's tougher to go slow with the Lotus so while extraction is every bit as good or better than a log, sometimes it's like  drinking from a fire hose. The nylon stainless steel tip on a dog allows for the most parsimonious use of herb that I know of."
vaporents,3diip9,ShitSnacks2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:07:25 2015 UTC,"UD is definitely more efficient. Have one, buddy has EQ. Great warranty service and accessories included too.

vaporents,3diip9,aeburnside,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:28:41 2015 UTC,I have an arizer air and pax 1 but have never had a desktop before. So you'd say the 7th floors desk tops are better than the eq?
vaporents,3diip9,WhiffyCornet,2,Thu Jul 16 21:18:33 2015 UTC,better is a vague term. the 7th floor vapes are less flashy and more to the point. they are probably more efficient than the stock EQ.
vaporents,3djbj7,shinndigg,4,Thu Jul 16 18:59:40 2015 UTC,"1) yes  2) as long as you want. Depends on what color you like your AVB to be.  3) just keep hitting it  4) sip from it slowly as if you're sipping a hot drink from a cup  Also, remember to keep the pax upright after sessions and to take a couple hits after you turn it off to clear the excess vapor from the vapor path. You won't have to clean it nearly as often if you do this."

I've used quite a few vapes over the past year or two, and I'd have to say that the Mighty is the best I've ever used. The battery life is incredible, and it gets me thoroughly high. As in higher than I've ever been with a vape before.   Edit: I have also owned and used a Pax 1 and 2, and I can honestly say that although you sacrifice stealth with a crafty or mighty, they are still very portable and imo work much better and get you much higher."

vaporents,3dih83,smoketreess,3,Thu Jul 16 16:17:56 2015 UTC,"I'll make it simple, the crafty or mighty. the one you get is based on your day to day functions, if you need to be discreet daily, crafty hands down, otherwise get the mighty because the 4 session battery on crafty may get annoying if multiple people are using it. Reason i'd get either: vapor quality is bomb.com, very little draw resistance, and you litterally get nice big clouds from very little work,  and it works fast so your not sucking on this thing for 10 minutes, my seshes are lightning quick mabey 2 mins? granted i take huge draws. cleaning is a sinch, just buy 100 proof alch and ur good, soooo easy to clean but has small small learning curv at first. very durable plastic and i have dropped this sucker already a few times looks brand new.  I used arizer solo for longest time but i got headaches from the draw resistance, gotta work your ass off on that one if you're a regular partaker. enjoy !!"
vaporents,3dih83,willliam971,2,Thu Jul 16 16:33:48 2015 UTC,"The Firefly is very efficient but it takes a bit of technique to get the most out of it. From what I've read,  the Crafty and Mighty are very easy to use and not dependent on any type of technique. The S&B vapes should also be more efficient than the conduction based Pax 2 since they primarily use convection heating with a small amount of conduction.  The Mighty seems pretty ideal for you two given the longer battery life and pass-through charging."

vaporents,3dih83,butter_my_fingers,2,Thu Jul 16 22:27:27 2015 UTC,"Buy one dude. Just received my crafty yesterday and I'm hyped. This workday is too damn long, I just want to go home and cuddle with the thing. First sesh was tricky because I didn't load it properly. Second sesh I fitted about 0.25g in there and sucked on that thing for a good, satisfying 10-15 min, pulling huge cloud (nothing compare to my MFLB) and was way higher than if I would have just rolled it or snap it in the bong. I'm probably on a honeymoon high but trust me and the 1000 other redditors who recommand this vape, it is truly a high-end quality product."

I would highly ;) recommend either one from Storz and Bickel. [T-Break]"
vaporents,3dih83,OG_LH,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:13:38 2015 UTC,"The main difference I've noticed between the S&B vapes and the Pax is size/portability/discreteness.  While you could carry the Mighty or Crafty in a pocket, it is much bigger and more awkward than a Pax 2.  And it is not discrete, at all.  And I personally haven't noticed any better effects from the Crafty than the Pax, but others seem to have.  Remember, this stuff is hugely subjective.  I posted this in another thread but these are the big difference between the Pax and Pax 2 as in my mind (having both):   The static mouthpiece. The mouthpiece was the biggest complaint about the first pax, it would get stuck and not heat the oven, or would be difficult to open and/or close. Required regular cleaning in this regard. The pax 2 doesn't have these problems and can go much longer between cleanings without any noticeable decrease in vapor quality. Oven temp control. The original pax did not regulate oven temputre as well as the Pax 2. Simply put, the Pax 2 is much more efficient with your goodies. It also heats up faster. Size. While the first pax is a great size, the Pax 2 is a much nicer size for pocket carry. Oven lid. the first pax oven lid has this annoying lip around the base which is a bitch to clean. Pax 2 lid is much smoother. Battery. I've definitely noticed an increase in the battery, may have to do with better oven temp regulation, but it lasts longer.   If you want a smaller, more discrete vape, get the Pax 2 - definitely a significant upgrade over the 1.  If you want to change it up and/or aren't planning to carry it around a lot or using it in public very much, either S&B will do you great, and the temp control is neat.   Good luck and happy vaping!"

vaporents,3di3dh,BellowingRapMachine,2,Thu Jul 16 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"I believe the technique is different when using a bowl vs vape.  When I use my vape, I just take a nice long draw.

vaporents,3deof5,Buttsmuggler69,15,Wed Jul 15 18:04:42 2015 UTC,"FYI for best use I would start at a lower temp, around white maybe and then move it up to red gradually. By the end you'll have huge clouds and already be stoned out of your mind. Jumping straight to red is less efficient in my experience."
vaporents,3deof5,Otaku_swag94,8,Wed Jul 15 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"You can really extend your session this way too. I don't know why more people don't do this. It's like you're hitting a new bowl with each increase, with different effects at each. Lower temps euphoria, higher temps sedative."
vaporents,3deof5,unlmtdLoL,3,Thu Jul 16 00:26:43 2015 UTC,First time I tried it I stayed only at low temperatures and even after 3 bowls only got to a 5 despite the bud being a nice brown. Second time I went right to red and I got a bit more stoned but it didn't last as long. Third time I started out low and worked my way up and one bowl got me to an 8.
vaporents,3deof5,Otaku_swag94,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:29:53 2015 UTC,"I really do think there's something to that. I can agree that the gradual increase in temp produces a better high. I'm not quite sure what it is, but if I had to guess, it's that you're getting the cannabinoids in increments instead of all at once (which can be overwhelming). It's my favorite way to vaporize."

vaporents,3deof5,ChromeForty,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:04:14 2015 UTC,"It's impossible that it would make you 'save your battery' because you make your heater work way more, when I use my Solo I start at 4 and go up when the vapor isn't enough for me. I basically just finish the bowl by taking 2 or 3 hits at the highest setting then shut it down - my Solo doesn't work as much as yours! Try it this way, it's been reported to work great for a lot of users here, including me :)."

vaporents,3deof5,Bud_Johnson,2,Thu Jul 16 01:14:13 2015 UTC,Try using a solo stem as a one hitter when you're battery dies. Red is NOTHING compared to the ass taste that is combustion.

The only major difference I noticed other than size and battery is that the mini has the option to act as a portable battery charger as well, other than that no major differences at all. Both hit the same, and have the same draw resistance."
vaporents,3dfvak,truesoul42,2,Wed Jul 15 23:12:39 2015 UTC,Thank you! That was the exact answer I was looking for
vaporents,3dfvak,blindfire95g,4,Wed Jul 15 23:40:12 2015 UTC,One thing about the mini is you can open the storage compartment while you take a draw and have control over your draw resistance.  Also the mini can be used as a power bank which adds discreetness and utility if you need to charge your phone.  Mini also has a slightly different mouthpiece which apparently is better then the regular.  I would pick the mini over the regular but both are great products.

vaporents,3de243,vidjust,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:18:42 2015 UTC,Can you compare the draw resistance?
vaporents,3de243,CloudEnt,3,Wed Jul 15 19:02:36 2015 UTC,Draw resistance is a function of how compacted your  material is in your vapor path. Some vaporizers require a lot more compacted material.   I think this is the difference between PAX and Air. I was always finding that I had to pack relatively large (compacted) ovens in the PAX to get the vapor quality I was looking for. (Yes I know about the screen trick but was never OK with vaping unknown metals in my PAX oven).   The Air on the other hand delivers that quality vapor without much compaction.  I loosely load and lightly tamp down to go slightly below the glass bowl and I feel very little resistance. I also tend to lift the bowl a few mm's so it's not  resting on the oven floor directly. This helps with more airflow.   The comparison isn't close IMO. Air wins hand down. I haven't used my PAX since getting my Air.
vaporents,3de243,Medic-Oil,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:24:50 2015 UTC,Thank you for the detailed response. I have been having draw problems with the Pax and the Flowermate. Sometimes I can't even really tell if it's coming out. I just got an Underdog so my problems are solved but it just makes the other two seem even worse.   Edit: I keep both pretty clean so I think it's a design issue more than anything.

vaporents,3dgl78,truesoul42,5,Thu Jul 16 05:55:19 2015 UTC,"The Arizer Air from puffitup is 169 with the code ""Air"". I know thats a little over your 150 but I think it will make you the happiest. I recently was looking for a good vape and after doing tons of research it came down to the Mighty and the Air.   Everyone who has an Air likes them, some of the people on the Fuck Combustion forums say they have both the Air and Mighty and still use the Air over the Mighty sometimes. The 169 includes a good amount: the unit, 2 tubes, charger, a little case that holds the unit as well as two tubes, caps to use on your prepacked tubes, a silicone protector for your unit, and a little pokey tool. Also once you have had it a while and wanna buy some upgrades you can get custom tubes, extra batteries or a wall battery charger (to charge 2 batteries at once).  I went with the Mighty, but only because I could afford it. It has a pretty hefty price tag. If I hadn't had the money to spend It would have been Arizer Air all the way, and I still plan on getting an Air with in a year or so."
vaporents,3dgl78,wilsontheball144,2,Thu Jul 16 06:10:25 2015 UTC,Honestly I would say spend 169 and get either the arizer or the alfa. They're both a large step up from the summit.

vaporents,3dgl78,druggie62,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:56:31 2015 UTC,"Good starter vape. Generally pretty solid. Preferred the Alfa when I tested them side by side, but it was far from a bad vape. Biggest complaint I had was that the oven cover is easy to knock off, so you'd probably want to throw a rubber band around it if you ever plan to pocket it.  Have you considered the Solo? It's not going to be as durable as the Summit or Alfa, since it has glass, but it performs almost identically to the Air and it would be in your price range."
vaporents,3df5tk,slippypenguin,4,Wed Jul 15 20:03:13 2015 UTC,"So for portables I would consider the arizer air and the goboof alfa for that price range. Both are $169. For desktops I would suggest the e-nano. You already have a bong, and the e-nano works amazingly well with a bong. The vapor quality of the air or the alfa won't even be close to the quality of the vapor from an e-nano+bong. Other options I would recommend for desktops are the DBV, SSV, and LSV, all can be found for under 200."
vaporents,3df5tk,truesoul42,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:06:36 2015 UTC,Didn't know you could find the Goboof Alfa for under $200. Can you suggest any stores that ship to Canada?

vaporents,3df5tk,lilwilly50,2,Thu Jul 16 01:01:45 2015 UTC,"Hey man, glad to hear you're being cautious! I have the flowermate mini, which is a fantastic starter vape. As much as I love it, after a month or two I'm already saving up to by the next tier up (I'm going for the Arizer Air.) the flowermate rocks, it's stealthy and portable for sure. My reason for choosing the mini was paranoia of having to explain to cops / landlord / parents if I ever did get caught. It functions as a USB battery pack so having that excuse made me much less fearful of getting caught.   But like I said, I'm already looking to buy a new one. It does the job, but just an additional 75 bucks right at the start will get you so much more. It's not like glass where it all pretty much functions the same- I thought the initial challenge of getting a vape was just getting whatever will actually vaporize and not combust- but there's a lot more to it l. Better to shell out a little more now & get something actually worth your while. [9] (with the flowermate mini!)"

But i'll wait and see how harsh the higher temperatures are on the vape before I buy one. $169 is a great deal, if a deal like that comes up again soon i'm jumping on it."

They're throwing in an extra battery for the delay, which is cool because I'd get one anyway.   If it works as well as the early testers indicate, it's the vape I want, whether I get it now or later.  Nothing else that looks as good in a portable has emerged, IMO."
vaporents,3dfen1,Surveyor3,3,Wed Jul 15 21:04:34 2015 UTC,"Go with the Air over the MFLB. It's worth the extra few bucks. It's easy to use and it's on the lowest end of the maintenance spectrum.   As for smell, they all smell. Get a window fan."
vaporents,3dfen1,BUKKAKE_BUKKAKE,2,Wed Jul 15 22:09:00 2015 UTC,What is your price range at?!?!
vaporents,3dfen1,blindfire95g,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:44:50 2015 UTC,I'm pretty flexible and open. I'd rather get something good than something I'll need to replace soon.
vaporents,3dfen1,blindfire95g,2,Wed Jul 15 22:38:14 2015 UTC,"well If your price point is around 100 I would go for flower mates as they are reliable for a low price, the mini is very discreet and packs a punch.   If your price range is 200 and below I would go for the alfa,vapium summit.  Both are discreet   If you want to spend big bucks the best units are the Mighty or crafty for portables I am not a fan of desktops so I'm not sure about those.  These are kinda on the big side but still amazing units"
vaporents,3dfen1,Garbage_Ent,3,Wed Jul 15 22:41:57 2015 UTC,Also in the $200 and below range is the arizer air it arizer solo.

Some relatively cheap ones I would recommend are the e-nano, underdog, LSV SSV DBV (search for the cosmetic seconds), and the arizer eq. However, if you are looking for a portable, check out the arizer air and the goboof alfa both of which are $169 on puffitup."

vaporents,3dfen1,truesoul42,-1,Thu Jul 16 02:38:32 2015 UTC,You said you live alone. So discretion for you has to do with smell yes? I used to pick THESE up all the time when I lived in a no smoking apartment building. It's like a pro sploof. If you don't know what that is. It's a personal air filter you blow the smoke through and it eliminates odor. As for vaporizers a nice Tower  vape is often cheaper and more powerful than handhelds.
vaporents,3dfen1,Kiht,2,Wed Jul 15 22:03:06 2015 UTC,Yeah definitely don't buy that easy vape..terrible recommendation kiht. But i do agree with the smoke buddy.

vaporents,3de078,Sofakingcoolstorybro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:53:03 2015 UTC,I specifically ask puffitup to match the price on the last drop (which is the same as the current one - 259$). The best they could do was 330$ so I went with the massdrop deal. The 2.5 weeks of waiting was painful but I did save quite some cash. Didn't expect the 60 $CAN duty fee though...

vaporents,3de078,Sofakingcoolstorybro,5,Sat Jul 18 17:54:35 2015 UTC,I recently got a mighty and it is hands down the best vape I have ever owned. So I'm assuming the crafty would be as well.
vaporents,3de078,cannagod,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:53:22 2015 UTC,"Yup, it is, for the 3 and a half sesh it lasts =) Non issue in the world of people obsessed with smartphones and chargers."
vaporents,3de078,SaladStoryEmperor,4,Wed Jul 15 22:21:06 2015 UTC,Yes it is.  Buy quality you won't regret it.  I've had a lot of vapes that have come and gone but the S&B products have never let me down.
vaporents,3de078,houseoflove,5,Wed Jul 15 16:15:30 2015 UTC,"If you get it on massdrop or puffitup for $260, absolutely. Hell, my friend has had one for awhile, and he says he would have paid 400 for it. It's by far the best portable vape Ive ever used. Pax, Davinci, mflb, what have you. Such a great form factor, smooth draw, huge rips, efficient, etc. And dummy proof. I love that I can share easily with friends who don't vape. Also, I don't miss the feeling of smoking when using this thing.  Battery issues are so overhyped imo. Jesus, if you're using it indoors try and keep it plugged in. Taking it outdoors? Charge it before you leave, or with a car usb adapter. It has enough charge to get you and your friends baked like 5 times. That not enough? $40 Power bank. Its pretty simple. The mighty is A LOT larger. Pretty drastic difference when you see them together. Better battery doesn't really justify it, and fiddling with temps on the device is overrated.  If you like vaping, skip the waste of money upgrading through the chain and get the crafty. End game portable vape for sure."
vaporents,3de078,Dick_Wellington,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:54:17 2015 UTC,"Would the power bank also work with a mighty, do you think?"
vaporents,3de078,sidney_cattier,2,Sat Jul 18 08:12:30 2015 UTC,"The crafty uses a micro usb charger while the mighty needs a wall outlet to work, so no.  The mighty occupies a pretty curious niche imo."
vaporents,3de078,Dick_Wellington,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:39:12 2015 UTC,Cheers mate.
vaporents,3de078,sidney_cattier,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:09:06 2015 UTC,"One more thing I've been meaning to ask actually... Can the crafty work without a smartphone app? That could be a deal breaker in my eyes, basically it means that your phone has to be charged as well as the vape. Is the app just for changing temps or for overall functionality? I love the look and sound of the crafty but I'm not sold on the phone element."
vaporents,3de078,sidney_cattier,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:49:57 2015 UTC,"Phone element is a non-issue. You use the phone app to adjust the crafty's settings: regular temp, boost temp, led brightness, vibrate etc. Once you do that it becomes permanent on the device, so you don't need your phone for it to work, only to change the settings.   I pretty much never change the settings, and don't even have my phone one half the time. Crafty still works."
vaporents,3de078,Dick_Wellington,9,Sun Jul 19 21:21:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say, spend more and get the Mighty. If portable but you don't need it to be extra stealthy, I think the extra battery in the Mighty would go a long way in having you not have to recharge the Crafty all the time. That's the only gripe I've heard, is that the battery is kind of weak. Mighty solves this problem, but it's a bit bigger.  I don't own a Crafty, but the Mighty is worth the $ and best vape I've used and most consistent at that. So I'd say either/or are worth it, but I'd say go Mighty over Crafty.  You can get a Mighty for like $340 and a Crafty for like $292 or something from PiU."
vaporents,3de078,HellsWindStaff,6,Wed Jul 15 16:31:41 2015 UTC,Or you can order a power bank on Amazon and keep your phone and crafty charged pretty much forever.
vaporents,3de078,Main_man_mike,0,Wed Jul 15 19:18:45 2015 UTC,"But you'll still have those few minutes of precious dowmtime when the Crafty is dead and can't be used :0  Being semi sarcastic. Waiting for it to charge a bit wasn't something that turned me off, but I have seen others gripe."
vaporents,3de078,HellsWindStaff,0,Wed Jul 15 19:50:08 2015 UTC,"I ran into the same problem with the air.  Then i got extra batteries from a different oem. The air would begin to get warm and then the oven blue light would flash and the thing would shut off.  I was freaking out because i thought i broke it.  Went back to the original battery and am having no problems.  Now i guess i have to buy some $20 batteries instead of the $7 ones i was using.  And as soon as i get 4 of them, i'm sure the air will quit...  That being said, im saving up to buy back up vapes"
vaporents,3de078,hittindzz,3,Wed Jul 15 22:16:10 2015 UTC,"The crafty is a very high quality product, I enjoy mine very much, both at home and out. I love having it in my pocket at concerts, turning it on when I feel like it, and going to the bathroom/outside to vape once it gives the ""i am ready vibration"". Its quick, stealthy and I'm back at the concert within a few minutes.  One important issue I have to mention - I don't know about other vapes, but I feel this one runs out of battery fairly quickly, and will not let you turn it back on if it runs out (even if you plug in the charger) for about 20 minutes.  Its not that big of a deal if you just charge it after you've used it. It will last for several vapes throughout an evening or whatever. That said, it's really annoying if you forgot to charge, and are now standing there like a moron at a ziggy Marley concert - sober - with a $400 block of useless electronics with weed in it in your pocket."
vaporents,3de078,Mostlyadogperson,5,Wed Jul 15 17:09:14 2015 UTC,Papers and matches still work at a Ziggy Marley concert...
vaporents,3de078,mmjpatient0912,2,Wed Jul 15 19:47:18 2015 UTC,There are a lot of comments talking about the upgrade to Mighty and I'd like to remind you that for $40 you can buy an external battery with 24000 mHa that would charge a crafty more than three times on the go. You can also use it to charge phones and other USB devices and I found that to be a better investment than buying a Mighty. Massdrop has them on sale for $160 off of regular price so if you're going to buy any portable vape in the near future I'd highly recommend the crafty. There have been reports of the device breaking a lot but they have a two year warranty.
vaporents,3de078,Some_Random_Nob,2,Wed Jul 15 18:38:00 2015 UTC,Two year warranty.

If you can vape and be good for 30 mins+, you should go for a Crafty and a external battery. I've owned Arizer Solo, MFLB, Firewood 2.0, Inhalater 5 and Iolite of portables. Crafty is the only vaporizer that really made me feel that it was made by a solid company that wasn't run from a garage or a factory in china."

If you're considering either the Crafty or Mighty, it's well within your price range(actually cheaper). Although, to be fair I've never used either the Crafty or the Mighty, but I can say the Pax 2 is pretty slick and great for a beginner."

vaporents,3ddvgk,-dudeman,3,Wed Jul 15 17:21:59 2015 UTC,"Once i was with this girl who never vaped before, but was curious what the effects would be. She never vaped before and only knew years of daily usage joints.    After we sat down and talked, we were gonna get started. I whipped out the no2 vapir (my only vape at the time), once she saw that she started rolling a joint. So i asked, why are you? Awsner: that thing is never gonna get me high.    After the no2 vapir was loaded and heated up, we started to take draws. Already after one sessions her response was, wow. That was all that could be said. After the second session shit got real. We started talking about how it all worked, vaping VS smoking. Already after 2 sessions she was in love with vaping. As a daily user she never expected to get that high. But, she immidiatly knew, it would never replace smoking, for the simple fact of how it feels to smoke, the combustion as you say.    After our third session, we started walking around, had this drunkish feeling, somewhat mini trippish even. Getting more and more in love with vaping, but still didnt change her opinion of smoking and sometime later still hasnt.    Those words when she first saw the vape really came back to her xD TL;DR Long time joint smoker fell in love with vaping, but could never give up smoking."

I had always had such a huge and varying range of results with edibles; from absolutely no effect to a chair-fusing 10. I needed to understand at least the lay-man's version of the chemistry behind edibles so I could properly and efficiently make reliable edibles.  This guide was made for regular pot edibles but I used what I learned with my abv and had great success with 1 tsp of abv. I just skipped the decarboxylation.

I've never actually tried to get absolutely ripped but I can get a solid 5/6 pretty easily and comfortably.   Best story is when this girl and I got to about a [6] and needed eyedrops so we walked to a grocery store and got them.   We thought we would look suspicious if we just bought eyedrops so we stood around in the fruit section trying to decide but ended up with pizza rolls.   The checkout guy knew.

vaporents,3dcgtc,the1npc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:48:00 2015 UTC,"Tough to say as I've never sat down and used a desktop vape by myself, only with groups.  And further my experience with desktops is pretty limited: just box vapes with whips and volcanoes.  My gut says that yes, if you were to fill a volcano bag with the same amount of bud it would probably get you higher.  But I would say that the Pax 2 is extremely efficient for bud usage and I always pack full ovens.  It really seems that the lip sensor that rapidly turns the oven down and up works, as a single session with the Pax 2 lasts much longer than even the first Pax, which was already impressive to me.  Another thing is that you can stir the Pax oven and get a few more hits and stir and hit - I don't do usually do that though, unless I only have the one oven and want a bit more (even though you can indeed get further hits this way they don't always taste the best)."

If I can't use a vape while it charges I sure as hell don't want it, considering most of them die after you get 1-3 good highs, and a lot take 4-5 hours to charge."
vaporents,3dcgtc,luke827,5,Wed Jul 15 14:51:06 2015 UTC,You either have never actually owned a Pax or you have clear lemons if they die after 1-3 sessions and take 4-5 hours to charge.  I have both a Pax 1 and a 2 and have used 3 other Pax 1s and none will die as quickly nor take nearly as long to charge.

vaporents,3dcgtc,JewpsyFruit,2,Wed Jul 15 18:32:28 2015 UTC,"If the extra cash is doable the Pax 2 is signifcant improvement in a couple key ways:   The static mouthpiece.  The mouthpiece was the biggest complaint about the first pax, it would get stuck and not heat the oven, or would be difficult to open and/or close.  Required regular cleaning in this regard.  The pax 2 doesn't have these problems and can go much longer between cleanings without any noticeable decrease in vapor quality. Oven temp control.  The original pax did not regulate oven temputre as well as the Pax 2.  Simply put, the Pax 2 is much more efficient with your goodies.  It also heats up faster. Size.  While the first pax is a great size, the Pax 2 is a much nicer size for pocket carry. Oven lid.  the first pax oven lid has this annoying lip around the base which is a bitch to clean.  Pax 2 lid is much smoother. Battery.  I've definitely noticed an increase in the battery, may have to do with better oven temp regulation, but it lasts longer.   That being said if cash is tight get the first one, it's still an amazing portable vape and can't beat it at that price!  I got my Pax as a gift and got my Pax 2 for $200 due to some fortuitous circumstances, but if I had neither and know what I know now, I'd get the extra cash for the Pax 2.   hope that helps!"
vaporents,3dcgtc,intellax,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:14:03 2015 UTC,Hey man I appreciate it. I'm thinking of buying the pax one deal to just have and kinda throw around cause it's only $160 or I just saw the grasshopper and that looks very interesting. What're your opinions?
vaporents,3dcgtc,JewpsyFruit,2,Thu Jul 16 02:54:54 2015 UTC,I don't have one and have yet to see one in person.  Looks like a great device and curious to see how it works out.

vaporents,3dcgtc,_theLittlePrince,-10,Wed Jul 15 17:37:27 2015 UTC,I can't get high at all because I don't trust the Chinese to mass produce a safe medical device.   It's too bad so few people know about more simple and natural devices made from safe materials be craftsmen instead of factory workers who don't even know what the thing the way are making does.   Many of these higher quality devices are even cheaper than the Chinese battery powered gadgets.   Home use: try a log vape like the E-Nano   Portable : maybe a Vapman

vaporents,3dekzk,Novakoner,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:21:23 2015 UTC,"Hell ya, I love this idea. I tried a few subscription boxes for ejuice and was sorely disappointed tho.  How will you maintain a variety?  Will you make your own cbd juice (zamplebox fucked up hard making too much ejuice and then saying it wasnt them and marketing it as a premium juice) or will you manage a lot of vendors to keep the variety?  Whats the pricing like? I know you need money, but the CBD juices I've seen thus far are around $45 for 10-20 ml, if youre adding a mark-up to that, I'm out immediately.  Lastly, is this subscription box based on ejuice type CBD products or are there other ingestion methods youre looking into?

Its a cheap vape that is sold for like $35 wholesale and produces plastic fumes when in use which are arguably worse than actual smoke. There are plenty of quality vaporizers out there, even if you are on a budget. Just peruse /r/vaporents and check out the reviews in the sidebar.  I personally can recommend:   Flowermate v5.0s (and the mini), both of which you can get for around $70-80 if you apply coupons Arizer Solo, which can be found for $120ish or less if you can find it on craigslist. Has very good vapor production and is probably one of the best choices MFLB if you are okay with a learning curve, but it is a really polarizing vaporizer and if you want an easy to use unit I would just say stay away from it"

vaporents,3dbpce,Frostiestone,2,Wed Jul 15 17:08:05 2015 UTC,"Whats your budget like? I own an imag+ and actually like it a pretty good amount. Given that it's a relatively cheap Chinese vape, people on this sub like to assume the worst of the imag but all of the reviews I've seen from people who have actually used it agree that it's pretty solid. Check the flair by my name, I own a decent range of fairly high quality vapes and I can safely say the imag is a good vape. My biggest issue with the imag is that the mesh screen in the mouthpiece clogs very easily restricting airflow. It clogs so easily that I would clean the mesh out pretty much every time before using it to ensure proper airflow. So out if your options, I think one imag is a safer bet than two titans.   With all that said, if you have a little more money to spare I think it would be worth the investment. While the imag is certainly great for its price and pretty damn good in general, it doesn't stack up compared to some of the better portables like the arizer solo/air. You can find the solo for around $110 and I personally think it would be worth the extra money. I don't think you'll be disappointed by the imag, but I think you'd be a good deal happier with something like the solo. However the solo is far less discrete than the imag and would draw a lot more attention when hitting it on the go.    So there's my opinion, out of your options go with one imag but consider spending a little more for something you're going to enjoy a decent amount better."
vaporents,3dbpce,R_Dthrowaway,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:36:05 2015 UTC,currently i would recommend the xmax v2 pro. It's similar to the imag+ but has two more temperature presets and the airpath is seperated from the elctronics. I'm not sure if that's the case with the Imag as well.

vaporents,3d9huo,Weedfordayss,16,Tue Jul 14 15:32:32 2015 UTC,"I know I'm going to get downvoted, but I'm going to go against the general consensus and say no. It's not worth it.  I paid $150 for my MFLB after hearing how great of a product it is from this subreddit. Admittedly I didn't know a whole lot about vaping at the time, I had been a smoker for eight years and decided I wanted something different than my Pax incase I did feel like vaping.   I couldn't help but feel as if I paid $150 for a product that costs $15 to make. It's literally a block of wood with a metal coil to vape your bud, a metal screen that acts as your trench, and a battery that supplies the heat to the coil. The trench itself is good size, you 'can' fit a reasonable amount of tree in there, IF your battery can last the entire 'full' trench. THIS is why this thing is a waste of money. Ignoring the fact that you can literally make this product for next to nothing (most expensive thing is technically the batteries, which they sell for like $10 online) the battery life is absolutely terrible.   The whole purpose of this vape is stealth, efficiency, and mobility. Right? Then why the fuck is the battery life on these things so abysmal? Because it's a cheap, A A - powered block of wood. I read tons of comments saying to get the adapter for longer battery life... which costs $80. I read even more comments saying to simply get used to operating it and work on your draw technique...as if it's a difficult concept (but I did practice).   The fact of the matter is this is one of those products that is probably awesome for someone beginning to vape/smoke. But unless you're one of those it's a huge waste of money in my opinion. Yes I bought replacement batteries, yes they still died too fast. The product just sucks to me. There are better vapes on the market for the price (even $75 imo)."
vaporents,3d9huo,Musicduude,3,Tue Jul 14 18:15:30 2015 UTC,"You and I have had the same experience, it sounds. The MFLB just isn't worth the money at all when you can save up a tiny bit more and purchase something way better."
vaporents,3d9huo,muddybunny3,3,Tue Jul 14 20:09:46 2015 UTC,That is what I am saying. I have winged several people off from buying the MFLB by simply allowing them to use mine. I really fail to understand why this product is so widely accepted.   I am not exaggerating when I say that you can literally make the same working product by simply pulling out some tools and spending $15 at your local home depot. It's WAY too expensive for what you get.
vaporents,3d9huo,Musicduude,2,Tue Jul 14 21:23:33 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no idea. I remember the MFLB people used to visit this subreddit (or was it /r/trees?) and they were really nice so people wanted to support them. Then came the huge MFLB fan club, and that's when I bought mine. Paid $120 for it and used it a LOT for about a year. I eventually got sick of trying to show others how to use it, the batteries dying, shaking between every hit, etc. so I bought a Pax (which was only $50 more, and I didn't have to buy extra batteries). I instantly regretted ever buying the MFLB once I tried the Pax the first time."
vaporents,3d9huo,muddybunny3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:19:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to come off as offensive, but as someone who uses the mflb daily I'm going to go ahead and guess that your technique was off. The MFLB is definitely more cumbersome to use and has a learning curve. However the benefits of the mflb are the lifetime, no questions asked warranty, the ability to directly control the temperature, easily clean, control draw length, heat duration etc. It's a very customizable experience. However I can also see why some people would rather just press a button and let the machine do it. Think of it like driving stick shift, the performance is only slightly better, but it feels more rewarding."
vaporents,3d9huo,flamebringer17,2,Wed Jul 15 01:56:46 2015 UTC,People don't realize the hidden costs of a decent grinder and extra batteries or a PA. By the time you start adding it up you could have had something that produces a better vape and is easier to use.
vaporents,3d9huo,HikaruEyre,2,Tue Jul 14 21:47:28 2015 UTC,"I spent a total of about $160 on my MFLB, and I didn't even buy the power adapter, just the box, extra batteries, and some cheap tubing to use with a bong. I bought my Pax for $170, literally $10 more than I spent on the MFLB, and it's crazy what the difference is between the two. It does everything the MFLB does but better. It's even more stealthy! Made me feel like I wasted $160..."
vaporents,3d9huo,muddybunny3,17,Tue Jul 14 22:24:14 2015 UTC,"What's your tolerance like? If you have a decently high tolerance at all then you'll likely be underwhelmed with the mflb. The mflb was my first vape and I've owned two of them for a total of 5 years now and I literally never use it at all. It's an okay starter vape, but like I said it's not very good for someone with a tolerance. If you value stealth over vapor quality/production, efficiency, and any other metric of comparing vapes then go for it. If stealth isn't by far your biggest concern then I'd suggest saving up a bit more for a vape you won't be disappointed with. You can get an arizer solo for around $110 and its significantly better in every aspect other than stealth.   There's a lot of people here that will swear by the mflb but everyone I know that has a decent tolerance agrees that it just doesn't cut it. The main proponents of the mflb seem to be younger kids who like it for the cheap price and how easy it is to hide from their parents. Everyone I know that owns an mflb has ended up upgrading and their mflb hasn't seen any use once that happens. If you don't have a really low tolerance and stealth isn't your absolute number one priority then I'd really recommend saving up more for something better."
vaporents,3d9huo,R_Dthrowaway,14,Tue Jul 14 17:22:57 2015 UTC,"Seconded, this guy shares my experience as well. MFLB is fine, until you get a better vape."
vaporents,3d9huo,aeburnside,12,Tue Jul 14 17:33:27 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree. I have an EQ, Lotus, Air and Flowermate and I still use my mflb a lot. I don't think its about tolerance because i vape about a quarter a week of homegrown and I don't consider the mflb a starter vape. It does take a technique and I do think that the PA is a must have for home use. I'm 31 and still use it when I go out to the bar or public events. If multiple people are going to vape I bring the Air, but its more about the on demand vape for the mflb. Damn near everything else is a session vape. I had the solo and I hated it but thats just my opinion. The Air to me isnt exceptional but i got it for a good price and the swappable batteries make it nice for on the go. Plus unlike the mlfb all i have to do with the air is tell people to ""Pull hard when inhaling"" so it makes it easier. For day to day use though session vaping is rather annoying especially 10 minutes(I was a bong, joint and 1 hitter daily smoker prior to vaping) so rarely did i smoke for 10 minutes at a time. Overall for 75 bucks its not a bad price and i would buy it. But also be aware its not for everyone. I actually dont think any vape is for every occasion. Just like i dont think being at a [10] is good for every occasion. Can i get to a 10 with the mflb, yup. Is it easier to get a [10] with my EQ or other vapes, yup. Do i always want to get to a [10], nope. Do i always have time to vape for long periods of time, nope. So its mainly getting to know what you like and what works for you. I actually dont really believe tolerance to be that big of an issue, because every strain is different. Some herb i vape and i can rip through multiple trench's or bowls, and some herb one nice bong rip and im lifted."
vaporents,3d9huo,Biscuits4Lunch,5,Tue Jul 14 19:27:35 2015 UTC,"While I may have upgraded vapes, my launch box still definitely gets use. It's a nice thing to have at my desk just always filled for a hit every now and then. Now with that being said I agree there's a good chance OP will not be satisfied with the MFLB"
vaporents,3d9huo,Yarlreadykno,3,Tue Jul 14 18:11:14 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm an old dude that has owned an Underdog (which I loved), but still do love my MFLB.  I have also smoked/vaped for more than 10 years daily, but still consider myself to have a low tolerance (and limit myself to 1 gram/week).  I don't think ""being experienced"" necessarily equates with needing a ton of weed to get off, though habituation/tolerance is a bitch and this does often happen.  I like that the MFLB is simple and portable.  I like that there is no minimum amount of herb required to vape completely (ie- you don't have to make sure a stem is packed solid to restrict airflow enough to get the color AVB you are looking for).  I like that MFLB newbies frequently do combust, which indicates that the MFLB is a vape that is more than capable of vaping at the highest temperatures and extracting all sub-combustion compounds (some technique is obviously necessary).  I like that its on demand.  I like that it has a lifetime warranty."
vaporents,3d9huo,I_wanted_truth,3,Tue Jul 14 18:25:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to say the mflb is awful, just that it is largely suited for those who have low tolerances. Based on what you've said, you fall in that demographic and that's completely fine. I go through different phases of how heavily I smoke but for a large portion of the year I'm averaging about a gram a day, so with that said my tolerance is around 7x higher than yours. This is hypothetical, if you think the answer would be yes then good for you I'm glad you enjoy the mflb, but do you see yourself using the mflb nearly as much as you currently do if your tolerance was 7x higher?   Again I think the mflb can be a good vape for a certain type of person but I feel that the demographic which is best suited for it is not one which I, or my friend group, is currently in. If you enjoy the mflb and it can get you to the level you're looking for thats great, I just offer my perspective as someone with a high tolerance that feels the mflb does not suit my needs."
vaporents,3d9huo,R_Dthrowaway,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:43:45 2015 UTC,I fall in your demographic and I think that's why I didn't like the MFLB or battery vapes for the most part. The Lotus has been the best thing for me. No batteries or cables and always ready to go. I do really like the Lotus the the MF Orbiter. I feel that MF should really lower the price of the MFLB and focus making profits more from their accessories.
vaporents,3d9huo,HikaruEyre,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:42:16 2015 UTC,"Dude, no. The MFLB has great vapor production and efficiency. The only tradeoff is that you need to know how to use it. Advanced technique can serve a high tolerance quite well. If you stack multiple hits on the same breath and make sure each one is as hot as possible, you'll be looking at it in a whole new light."
vaporents,3d9huo,mflbninja,14,Tue Jul 14 17:32:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to have this debate because its brought up by the mflb fanboys every time I say I don't like the mflb. I've owned two of them for 5 years, I own new glyph batteries, I know the technique to use the mflb. I've had plenty of time to get experienced with stacking hits, micro hitting, and even using a third lung and waterfall attachments with it. My technique is not the issue and its really saying something about the quality of the product that people instantly assume you don't know how to use it if you say you don't like it. For some odd reason, those who like the mflb pretend like the fact that it has a big learning curve is a good thing. That's a complete joke, one mark of a good product is that it should be intuitive to the user and minimize any learning curve. Most people don't want to have to learn a technique to hit a vape, they want a vape that just works. Not to mention the small trench size and technique makes it conpletely awful for groups. Again, my technique is absolutely not the issue here and I can in fact get high from an mflb. However it's not worth the time and effort it takes to get a mediocre high from an mflb when I have so many significantly better vapes I could be using.  I don't care what technique you use, if you're used to packing a full volcano bowl and hitting all by yourself on a daily basis, a single trench from an mflb just won't cut it.   We're all aware that you like the mflb...a lot. Just trust me that there are those out there that understand the technique required to hit it and still don't like it."
vaporents,3d9huo,R_Dthrowaway,5,Tue Jul 14 17:45:12 2015 UTC,"Well my frient, you have convinced me to put my plan on hold. I have a da Buddha but have been looking for good honest reviews of portable vapes. I had settled on the flight box as a price point. I will now look into other similarly priced options, perhaps the aforementioned airizer solo. Thanks."
vaporents,3d9huo,Kingjakers,2,Tue Jul 14 18:06:05 2015 UTC,"Well as you can see from this thread there certainly are people who like the mflb, it just doesn't get my personal recommendation. Da Buddha is a very nice, high quality desktop vape and I feel like if you're used to that, going to a mflb would be a let down. The solo is great, one of my favorite portable vapes and I think you'll be happy with its performance. Depending on what your priorities/budget is you should also consider looking into the arizer air. I got one recently and have been enjoying it a lot. You can get an air for $150 so its a little bit more pricey but it's also about half the width of the solo and has replaceable batteries. However the smaller form factor comes with some drawbacks, a shorter battery life and the two lower temps that are on the solo aren't available on the air. I'm really liking the air but it just depends on what you want, you for sure will not be disappointed with either.   Alternatively if you're willing to consider butane vapes the lotus is in that same price range and is surprisingly good. I admittedly don't use my lotus much because I messed up the screen in the bowl and have yet to get a replacement but it's a very good little vape."

It just looks really nice and that's appealing I guess but I've never been able to get a satisfying high. What irks my nerves even more about this vape is that when you post about not getting high enough you get a circle jerk about the technique, it shouldn't be that fucking complicated to begin with. Op do yourself a favor and save yourself headaches from the learning curve and hidden costs, save up for an Arizer or get a Flowemate if this is your budget."
vaporents,3d9huo,Troublecleff04,0,Wed Jul 15 13:25:28 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. Most mflb owners are 16 year olds. If you're older than that you might as well DIY an mflb for fun, or save up for a 'real' vape."

vaporents,3d9huo,TrippyFaux,2,Tue Jul 14 18:40:41 2015 UTC,"Nope. Considering how cheap you can get an Arizer Solo for on eBay? I would never get a MFLB. I used a MFLB for 2 years, have had my solo for 2 years now. Went back to the solo, absolutely hate the thing now. It just, sucks compared to a better vaporizer. IF you're NOT used to a better vaporizer, it's gonna be the bees knees. But I would spend the extra $50 and get an Arizer Solo.   FOr the record I owned the power adapters, bought the expensive extra life batteries, water pipe attachment, wooden and glass stems. I've spent tons of money on it."

I dont use mine much anymore but when i couldnt find the chargers to my solo and air i had to break out the mflb for a road trip.   However, note that the mflb is not a session vape. Its heat on demand. Works wonders to stay high or if you have a low tolerance. If you have a higher tolerance youll need a couple of full trenches and some time to vape it all."
vaporents,3d9huo,thedelo187,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:06:42 2015 UTC,What about the MFLB attracts you to buying it as opposed to other portable vapes other than the low price?
vaporents,3d9huo,thedelo187,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:11:03 2015 UTC,"I've wanted a portable vape for a while now. I like the idea of vaping bud because of the health ""benefits"" (as in it not being as bad for you as blunts and joints). What attracted me to the MFLB specifically was the price because I have a low budget for this sort of stuff."
vaporents,3d9huo,Mutasyn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:24:16 2015 UTC,"As a MFLB owner I have been happy with my purchase. Make sure you have a good grinder as a finer grind is recommended. Buy extra batteries, you can unwrap the RECOMMENDED AA batteries instead of buying MFLB batteries. Get a better charger as well (intellicharger is a good one either the I2, I4, D2, or D4). Look up how to take hits properly, that has to be the biggest learning curve with the MFLB."
vaporents,3d9huo,muddybunny3,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:55:05 2015 UTC,Would regular rechargeable AA batteries work with it?
vaporents,3d9huo,mrcantrell,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:03:06 2015 UTC,As long as the AA battery is a NiMH and has a cell of 2000 mAh then you should be good. The recommended batteries straight from the manufacturer are either the Imedion 2400 mAh or the Powerex 2700 mAh.

vaporents,3d9huo,thedelo187,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"Alternatively you can buy the adapter add-on that eliminates the need for batteries. Obviously it limits portability (unless you can plug in somewhere at random), but for home use it's perfect."
vaporents,3d9huo,mrcantrell,3,Tue Jul 14 17:24:32 2015 UTC,"But then you're spending at least $160 for a shitty desktop vape, when you could put that money towards something way better."

vaporents,3d9huo,mrcantrell,3,Tue Jul 14 17:42:47 2015 UTC,I just can't bring myself to buy it. $80 just seems so over priced for what it is (technically speaking). I can say the same thing about the finishing grinder.
vaporents,3d9huo,thedelo187,-2,Tue Jul 14 17:53:35 2015 UTC,Have you tried it? That's what's going to change your mind. The PA also has a wheel on it to control how hot the trench is getting. Between that and the consistent constant power I find it makes a huge difference in the output.  Don't forget to get the car attachment too.
vaporents,3d9huo,muddybunny3,3,Tue Jul 14 17:58:41 2015 UTC,I have not tried it. I had thought about making my own but just haven't gotten around to it. At this point though I'm more into concentrates and use an e-nail.

vaporents,3d9huo,mrcantrell,2,Tue Jul 14 22:57:48 2015 UTC,"So you spent at least $80 on the MFLB, and another $80 on the adapter? Why not buy literally any other vape instead of wasting your money on a plug-in wooden box with a short circuit?"

Here is some additional (imo) info: imo, Extreme Q is really popular due to its price and options (whip, balloon and bong hookups) Given this, its a quite obvious desktop vape choice for many. But many do say the vape itself isnt top notch, alas the first sentence of aeburnside. (no experience here though) In my research it was quite obvious, ppl love the DBV and SSV. Where most say the SSV is a small upgrade, for a lot, not worth the price difference. My research did conclude that any other desktop vape in that price range should not be considered, due to DBV, SSV and Extreme Q are better. Now for the more expensive model, nothing can compare to the volcano or de verdamer, those are, if i may say so, legendary vaporizers. Buying one of those will never be a mistake.      Just question yourself. What do i prefer. Whip only?-> DVB or SSV. Many options and dont care giving up some quality?-> Extreme Q. Top notch quality balloon?-> volcano. Top notch bong like vape?-> de verdamper. Top notch whip?-> Honestly dont know this one."

Here is the tutorial: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sbPC4SwGok The optimal bag size for one person is around a foot long. The amount of bags you get from the chamber will depend on how much you pack in there. The filling chamber is quite large. I used to get around 8 bags for half a gram.  Each session I vape through 157,160,165,175,185,198 degrees Celsius with my digital volcano and/or Mighty.  Keep your ABV as it is very potent from the volcano. Water cure then cook into coconut oil with soy lecithin at 120c for one hour then freeze the lot.

If you don't need portable at all consider something like an enano or an herbalaire (the herbalaire will likely be my next purchase).  If you really need that size and portability consider perhaps the firefly.  I haven't tried that one personally but people sing praise about it all the time on this sub and it doesn't have all the mixed and underwhelming reviews a pax has.  Ultimately, the pax isn't bad, I just don't feel it's worth the price for what you get.  Alternatively there is also the MLFB.  I've tried it once and it does take a bit of technique, but it's extremely tiny and it's benefit over competition is it's price.  People that have used this and the firefly tend to say the firefly is much nicer however.  Lastly, you could consider a Grasshopper.  I can't comment on it's function because I've never used it and I'm not even sure if it's shipped out to consumers yet, but their website says ordering now will ship in september.  This vape is pretty small so I'm not sure how it'll perform compared to a larger more robust piece, but it looks like these guys spent a lot of time and consideration on it, and if you're looking for something sleek and sexy this certainly fits that bill."
vaporents,3dbezd,DuexTrios,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:33:17 2015 UTC,So discrete when you're not using it. It's a little stinky when it's fired up but nothing near actually smoking. Overall I think it's worth the money as an owner

vaporents,3dcll0,greenpower93,4,Wed Jul 15 05:32:33 2015 UTC,Yeah the crafty is an awesome choice. Or the mighty if you want more battery life and are fine with the size. It's the closest to volcano-quality vapor that you are going to get from a portable.

vaporents,3db94y,aeburnside,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:47:13 2015 UTC,What is your budget?  Id like to spend no more than $250 on a portable vape.   What is your primary concern when choosing a vape?  Big hits and efficiency.   What is your typical partaking environment?  This will be used during my outdoor activities mostly. Stealth isn't very important   How many will be using at once?  Probably mostly solo with a few friends occasionally.   What is unique about your situation that needs consideration? Can't always recharge. So replaceable battery pack would be nice.
vaporents,3db94y,aeburnside,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:39:46 2015 UTC,Air is great for replaceable batteries and is probably the most efficient in your list but I'd check out butane vapes too (the lotus or daisy are popular).

vaporents,3dasbx,Ent_of_Louisiana,2,Wed Jul 15 02:01:11 2015 UTC,"I actually own both of these vapes. I bought the MFLB four years ago, and it has served me well for a long time. It's small, discreet, and is one of the least smelly vaporizers. Eventually it won't work as well, but then you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty and just ask them to replace it (they always will). The finishing grinder helps too: you want as much surface area of your herb touching the screen as possible. The finishing grinder only costs $20 on amazon. The MFLB was $100 when I bought it, but I hear it's now $120.  I just got the Flowermate 5.0s yesterday. My initial impression is very positive also! It has bigger clouds, which isn't as good for stealth but is inherently satisfying. I can get higher with this than the MFLB, and it's easier to use. It's definitely a big step up from the MFLB in my opinion, and if you use the coupon code for the flowermate at puffitup.com (FM I believe), you can get the Flowermate 5.0S for $85, and it comes with a free big puffitup grinder."

vaporents,3dasbx,cincobro-oche,2,Wed Jul 15 09:22:35 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind spending the money I would suggest the MF finishing grinder for any vape. A better grind means better surface area which makes better vapor, if you don't get a MFLB it fits over an average size pill bottle or film canister which you can then use to load your bowl/trough/trench/stem. I used to think turning my grinder upside down was the way to go but it doesn't come close to the finishing grinder."
vaporents,3dasbx,ballbeard,0,Wed Jul 15 16:52:17 2015 UTC,I have a grinder with very sharp teeth it gives a very fine grind so I doubt I'll be getting that grinder. Thanks for the tip.

The MFLB is a decent vape once you get your technique down. However its a pain to try and show someone new how to use it. There is just no beating the consistency and the over all quality the Flower Mate has over the MFLB.

I watched a lot of YouTube reviews on both devices and decided to go with the Air.  Looks aside, the Air and the Pax seemed pretty similar to me on video. What I like more about the Air is it can be used while charging and the battery is changeable if you have a spare.  In comparison, the Pax appear to charge on some sort of dock and I don't think you can use it while it's charging. I have a TV remote that charges on a similar type of dock, and that thing sucks.

vaporents,3da7mo,GentlemanMarionette,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:56:09 2015 UTC,"Im a newer vaporent myself and am currently thinking about pulling the trigger on a goboof alfa after 2 months of researching.  Im not exactly experienced at vape usage but I do know you will need to provide a bit more information in order to get good advice/accurate here.  How important are size, portability, and discreetness to you? Im guessing not extremely if you are considering the arizer(solo or air? You didn't specify). To me it seems more of a in house type portable and not a pocket style one. A good way to answer this is to ask yourself where you will be using it mainly.  How about a desktop? I know you said portable but I almost guarantee someone would ask so better to ask about it now.  How important are efficiency and vapor quality to you?   Are you opposed to non-battery vapes?  How about a convection style vape(these tend to have a steeper learning curve and more of a skill aspect involved)?  As far as battery goes a lot of the more recent vapes have usb charging and also pass-through charging(use while plugged in). With this you can get a external battery for when you are on the go. Another option would be to go the user-replaceable battery route and just get yourself a few extras or even some higher quality ones that higher more power.  What tabletop vape does your friend have? This might five some insight into what experience you are looking to reproduce in a portable.(I will warn you that tabletops tend to be higher quality vapor then portables depending on the two you compare[some people say the crafty{not the best battery on the crafty just an fyi}and mighty are comparable to desktops])  How important is warranty to you? Pax has a 10 year so I was curious if that went into your thoughts. If you plan to buy used then it doesn't really matter.  Do you want a lot of temperature control?  Good luck man."
vaporents,3da7mo,GentlemanMarionette,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:58:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the questions there's a lot i didn't think about apparently. Discreetness and portability are a huge plus but not a nessecity. Desktop isn't really an option unfortunately. I will mostly be using it at home but i definitely go hiking and whatnot every other week or so, so i can backpack it if i have to. Effeciency is another plus but not requirement. I honestly have no idea what the difference is between the convection and regular haha. i usually take good care so warranty is whatever, and temperature control is cool but im not too particular."
vaporents,3da7mo,GentlemanMarionette,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:03:33 2015 UTC,The alfa and summit are both advertised as sports vapes and charge via usb with pass-thru(I think so at least). Not saying these are the vapes for you just the kind I'm looking at(I go backpacking also[the summit requires some stirring though so you would have to stop hiking to use it) both of them work in low temps. The alfa is also really small and discreet. Convection heats more evenly but generally requires some manual button pushing for heating. It is more efficient generally and tastes better but it also can combust if you do it wrong. Also I believe the v-tower is a pretty well liked desktop but other then that I know next to nothing about it specifically.  The arizer solo and air both don't strike me as truly portable so out and about they are not really an option as far as that goes. But for in home use I know a lot of people love them. Other then that I don't really know how to help you but I hope answering the questions helps someone else help you more. Good luck.
vaporents,3da7mo,GentlemanMarionette,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:27:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i think i might be leaning towards the pax but my main issue is im not sure if the battery will last long enough"
vaporents,3da7mo,ChuckNorr1s,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:31:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i think its about an hour usage from a full charge. However, it also only takes an hour to recharge to full I believe. That is pretty good. A lot of vapes I've seen with over an hour of battery take almost twice as long to recharge. A lot of people like it and I imagine there is good reason behind it. I would advise caution and make sure you use a verified retailer. The original pax has more then a few counterfeit versions Of it and it is better to be safe then sorry. Also if you get the pax make sure to check out some cleaning g tutorials because I hear the mouthpiece area is a pain to deal with if you don't take care of it from the start. Also, if you like the pax you might look at the pax 2 they fixed a lot of the issues with the first one as well as just improvements all around. Most notably it has a 90 minute battery or so and also is better as far as efficiency and cleaning are concerned."
vaporents,3da7mo,mwilliams7795,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:50:51 2015 UTC,Also the pax 2 is more expensive obviously but considering ploom vapes have a 10 year warranty I honestly think that it is worth it to spend the cost if you consider the normal warranty is 2 years. It is nice to know you are covered considering the investment involved in buying a vape. I know the counterfeit issue persists fir the pax 2 as well so if you do consider it make sure you research.

I love my Air! It is my second vape, I bought a Vapir NO2 when they first came out (years ago) that the heating element died on and this blows it away in every way. Portability with the swappable 18650 rechargeable batteries is excellent since I have ~10 of these batteries for my nicotine vaporizer (you can use it plugged in too). It heats quickly and vapes the herb evenly and from what I can tell very efficiently (not much thc left in the AVB) you can get a Gong attachment and use it with any glass on glass water tool you may have. Loading and cleaning is a breeze since the ""bowl"" is part of the mouthpiece. You get an excellent taste with the all glass vapor path.

vaporents,3d9e4j,iampreferd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:06:24 2015 UTC,"/u/Ojan_at_PAX commented on this video a while ago  Temperatures taken are those of the oven, not its contents.  Maintaining precise content temperatures is tricky in a convection oven as every draw would rapidly cool the oven.  From your post history, eg. ""The pax 2 is all about aesthetics"" it's clear you're not the biggest pax fan and that's cool, to each his own.  But posting a video like this without context or discussion while OP clearly already has his mind set on a Pax 2 isn't particularly helpful especially when many others view the Pax as a great option for a vape.  Edit: sp,formatting"
vaporents,3d9e4j,mmayhen,0,Tue Jul 14 17:17:33 2015 UTC,The way this guy runs the tests are bogus. He is not obtaining the actual temps because he is never drawing from the pax when taking the temp.
vaporents,3d9e4j,Dos3rd,-9,Tue Jul 14 18:28:17 2015 UTC,Don't want to be the guy who suggests an MFLB but if you know nothing about it you should seriously take a look at it. Totally stealthy and incredibly efficient in terms of herb usage in comparison to the pax which just wastes vapor to create 'impressive clouds'. Sorry.

I have read good things about this vaporizer, to sum it up, this would be the cheapest vaporizer on the market which I would feel safe using (unlike the Titan/G pro). Essentially it is the same as a Titan without the infamous plastic taste, scorching oven, and an isolated airpath from electronics! I have wanted to pull the trigger for a while but the 60-day shipping from Aliexpress put me off. Definitely in for one now, thanks Massdrop! For those of you wondering, I would compare this to the Xmax V2. Also it should hold its own when up against the Flowermate series. I wouldn't quite say killer, but I expect comparable performance for 1/2 the cost."

vaporents,3d9j3c,mrva,3,Tue Jul 14 15:48:19 2015 UTC,There are way too many options and you would have to narrow down what you want way more.  Portable or not? Do you need it to be discreet? How important is taste?  And probably a couple more questions could be asked.
vaporents,3d9j3c,learn2burn,2,Tue Jul 14 15:46:55 2015 UTC,"Ok - portability would be nice, discreet is good but doesn't necessarily have to be a small as a MFLB or a Pax. Taste - ehh, as long as it is palatable. Does that help?"

But if you aren't looking for a portable I'd go with the Da Buddha vaporizer. It is easy to use, there is a slight learning curve because it can get hot enough to combust. So finding a good temp and draw speed is key. But after tax mine came out to 204, and I love it, ever since I got it its been my daily driver."
vaporents,3d9j3c,Kingjakers,2,Tue Jul 14 15:48:54 2015 UTC,"Start with a da Buddha or a silver surfer. I started with the former when I changed over from smoking. It was and still is my go too desktop vape (I can't afford a volcano), and is the desktop I've had the best over all experience with. Ease of use is incredible, just a knob. Watch a couple you tube videos and you are good to roll. Two tips though, always start with a lower temp than you think you need and work up, if you buy smaller quantities of varying strains this is important as every time I've bought the vape temp has been different. Also buy a small stick magnet strip, I stuck it to the base of my machine so you have a place to store the pick."
vaporents,3d9j3c,KILLAH-WHALE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:18:00 2015 UTC,Totally agree. Another option by the same company that works wonders is the LSV. Basically they took da Buddha and made it so you could hold it in your hand.

From what I hear the performance is identical other than the air holding temperature more reliably. The only real difference is the size and number of heat settings(Solo holds a larger proprietary battery while the Air uses common 18650 rechargable batteries. I love my Air! It is my second vape, I bought a Vapir NO2 when they first came out (years ago) that the heating element died on and this blows it away in every way. Portability with the swappable 18650 rechargeable batteries is excellent since I have ~10 of these batteries for my nicotine vaporizer (you can use it plugged in too). It heats quickly and vapes the herb evenly and from what I can tell very efficiently (not much thc left in the AVB) you can get a Gong attachment and use it with any glass on glass water tool you may have. Loading and cleaning is a breeze since the ""bowl"" is part of the mouthpiece. You get an excellent taste with the all glass vapor path. If you didn't find it here already check out puffitup to purchase http://www.puffitup.com/category-s/171.htm[1] Use the code AIR and it drops the price about $90."

Best investment is in the Magic Flight Launch Box for 125 off their main website and anywhere above $75 in other places. The MFLB is a completely stealthy vaporizer and provides incredible efficiency by heating herb to the perfect temperature to produce the perfect amount of vapor. Pros: Stealthy, good price, lifetime warranty, efficiency, aesthetic design, reasonably priced, tons of cool features and ad-ons coming out monthy, produces AVB, produces milkable stem, easy to clean (incredibly easy) Cons: slight learning curve, semi-short battery life (comes with 2 batteries and a charger so not that bad really)"

vaporents,3d89zs,SweetLeafAced,6,Tue Jul 14 07:47:51 2015 UTC,"Between the two, the stem makes more difference than the model. The Air is more portable and has interchangeable batteries and the Solo has more temperature options and a bigger battery. The stem is what effects the draw resistance the most- and both the Air and the Solo's stock stems have lots of draw resistance. If you're concerned about it, there are third party stems from PV and puffitup (can't speak for the puffitup, but the PVHE stems work wonders) which can solve the issue and also make them both water tool compatible.   tl;dr- They're the same. Different glass stems change the resistance."
vaporents,3d89zs,ExpectMP,3,Tue Jul 14 09:17:13 2015 UTC,"from my personal experience even though people say the draw resistance is big on the solo, I don't think it's all that bad"
vaporents,3d89zs,sun_tzu_strats,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:51:54 2015 UTC,It's also not really a draw back. Slow controlled draws are the best way to get the most out of the solo.  I've used high efficiency stems with extra airflow and it wasn't a better experience imo.  Something more powerful like the Mighty benefits more from less resistance as the heater can actually keep up.

vaporents,3d7xxj,Svstem,2,Tue Jul 14 06:52:48 2015 UTC,it is! It's more like the xmax v2
vaporents,3d7xxj,mrgreen85,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:44:41 2015 UTC,Nice. How's the vapor quality compared to the Max and how long is the shut-off timer?
vaporents,3d7xxj,Svstem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:52:23 2015 UTC,"very similar in any way. However, the xmax v2 mouthpiece is better (especially the new glass one)"
vaporents,3d7xxj,mrgreen85,2,Tue Jul 14 08:13:38 2015 UTC,I see. If Ciggo could make a glass mouthpiece that would be pretty cool.

vaporents,3d7xxj,Malamutewhisperer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:10:22 2015 UTC,A frient of mine wants a cheap vape. I have a flowermate v5.0s and he likes it very much but doesn't want to spent a hundred bucks for a vape (in Germany we vapes aren't that cheap). Is the herbstick eco a good vape for the money?
vaporents,3d7xxj,niedie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:19:45 2015 UTC,"I have read good things about this vaporizer, to sum it up, this would be the cheapest vaporizer on the market which I would feel safe using (unlike the Titan/G pro). Essentially it is the same as a Titan without the infamous plastic taste, scorching oven, and an isolated airpath from electronics! I have wanted to pull the trigger for a while but the 60-day shipping from Aliexpress put me off. Definitely in for one now, thanks Massdrop!  For those of you wondering, I would compare this to the Xmax V2. Also it should hold its own when up against the Flowermate series. I wouldn't quite say killer, but I expect comparable performance for 1/2 the cost."
vaporents,3d7xxj,squigglynuker,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:54:02 2015 UTC,I took my Titan II apart and found the problem was the the air flow passed by the chamber insulation that would get scorched from the chamber giving off the bad taste. With the isolated air path maybe the resolved that issue. Other than the taste I didn't think the Titan II was that bad of a vape. The vape was kind of hot because the air outlet is close to the chamber but other vapes share this issue.
vaporents,3d7xxj,HikaruEyre,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:59:41 2015 UTC,"I would attribute that to poor design of the heating chamber. Many other vapes do not isolate the airpath from electronics such as the Flowermate, yet those still perform well. For me, it's just a nice added feature which I think is undervalued. If I'm buying something new today I would want a clean airpath. More and more vapes are implementing this into their designs."

vaporents,3d3xbs,Djdragon44,3,Mon Jul 13 12:52:47 2015 UTC,"Not a Loki, it's a Magni 2 that has since been replaced by my Woo Wa3. The Modi 2 Uber is a very good, cost efficient DAC. I had tons of interference from my desktop even with my Dragonfly so I picked up the Modi and there's absolutely no background now, completely black. I'd definitely recommend it.

vaporents,3d3xbs,Crookmeister,4,Mon Jul 13 23:40:48 2015 UTC,"No not at all, decent cans are decent cans. But it's highly dependant on the specific headphone and your preference in sound signature! For example, i personally love the A900x and that's a $150 headphone that shits all over something like the more expensive M50 IMO, and it also runs great from portable devices, phones and laptops. /u/eftj's HD650's sound pretty lack luster to my ears from similar sources though especially since they are high impedance and require a healthy voltage swing, hence the sexy woo. Hes actually got a killer headphone setup for vinyl listening! The HE500 that you see in my shitty photo are planar magnetic headphones which require a lot more current output to sound their best otherwise they sound very thin and bass-light when underpowered. There are cans like the Philips X2 which is also an open back that gets in the region of similar fidelity and that runs pretty sweet straight out of an idevice for example.

The K7xx series have very power hungry and low sensitivity drivers so they do benefit from additional current despite their impedance rating!

I went with the vapium mainly because it was a product MADE by the company and not a rebranded chinese product. I picked it over the flower mate because of the 8 temperature settings and for its easy cleaning. I also liked how the bowl only carried .3g but managed to conserve the herb a lot more efficiently than most vaporizers (all vapes are great at conservation but the summit is above average from what I noticed). The glass mouthpiece on the flower mate seemed awesome, but I was afraid I would one day break the piece trying to get it out of the bottom chamber. Both vapes are great, but it all depends if your willing to spend $50 more for the summit"
vaporents,3d5xle,PussyOnTheChainWax95,3,Mon Jul 13 22:46:59 2015 UTC,As someone with the flowermate that mouth piece is solid but light enough not to break if it falls. Really well done product.

The only advice I would give is that if you cannot afford the ~$800 price that the Cloud Evo and a HydraTube bubbler that VapExhale leads you to believe is a requirement to use it, don't do it.  Simply buy the Cloud Evo itself for $450, or even better, wait for a 20-30% discount that comes around regularly and get it for ~$300 - $350.  I then got a gong adapter for the top and 18"" of surgical tubing and that's my mouthpiece.  As /u/vaporentsthrowawy says, it's an amazing device.  Hits like a bong and is stingy with herb.  (I actually did spend the $800 and I have the hydratube, but I don't like it.  Between the Cloud Evo and the hydratube on top, it's just way too big and awkward for me.

vaporents,3d65va,star_particles,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:45:27 2015 UTC,The solo and air uses 3 types of heating. Conduction. Convection. And radiant heating.
vaporents,3d65va,Hyroero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:50:07 2015 UTC,Tru but I'm speaking more so to the dominant style of each vape and how these two different methods can compliment eachother quite nicely when used together
vaporents,3d65va,_theLittlePrince,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:03:47 2015 UTC,Convection gives you a better taste in my experience and it's nice to be able to leave the herb in the unit and pull when needed without worrying that the herb is getting vaped and wasted.  For portable units conduction is much easier on the battery which is why most portables are mostly conduction.  Pros and cons to both but out of all the vapes I've used the Evo which is almost entirely convection has been the best experience.  My second favorite the herbalaire was mostly conduction with it's metal crucible system. Just had to make sure to keep on pulling once you pop a crucible in there or you waste a lot of herb. Same deal with the Mighty.

vaporents,3d46vh,rodneyb74,2,Tue Jul 14 00:35:18 2015 UTC,"This is a ""finish"" grinder. To be used after you use your regular grinder, it really gets your flower super fine, which exposes more surface area of the plant matter to be vaporized. It truly does give you much more consistent and reliable hits, especially with the MFLB. But i'm sure its good for any Vape. However, some of these vapes that have like a ceramic or glass filter in them, the holes may be two wide for the finished grind, you may end up with a little powdery fluff in your mouth. Also I've discovered with the MFLB that if I travel with the finish ground flower in the trench it tends to sneak out the shallow channel that is machined in the top under the plexi-lid and dust up my carrying case. Not that big a deal though, I just try to remember to face it so that channel isn't facing down, when I carry it in my pocket. I don't I guess to really answer your question, I'm lazy and this is a whole nother grinding process I have to go through before I vape and I still do it because its that good. If it wasn't that great i'd just take my stuff out of my Mendocino Mulcher Vape grinder and call it good, cause it gets it's pretty fine as it is, but not as good as the finish grinder. [6]  tldr: It's great use it."
vaporents,3d46vh,Dgizzle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:51:39 2015 UTC,Would you recommend I use a space case and then a MFLB finishing grinder for my Arizer Extreme Q or will the grind be too fine?  I use elbow packs btw.  Thanks for any advice.
vaporents,3d46vh,bowlfortwo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:40:01 2015 UTC,Not hard to clean at all. The metal insert pops out and you can easily clean the grinder with your brush - do it over your trench because a good amount of kief will come out
vaporents,3d46vh,hitforhelp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:08:53 2015 UTC,I have a black walnut one. Extremely happy with the grind that it gives and the design of it. My only complaint with it is the size of it. While it works well if placed ontop of a MFLB it is fine but for wanting to use it like a normal grinder it can be a little fiddly. I tend to place it flat on a sheet of card/paper with a fold in the middle then hold in place with 2 fingers and grind onto the paper directly.

vaporents,3d6buz,howtoshakeit,3,Mon Jul 13 21:33:50 2015 UTC,"I have no experience with the Flowermate but I can give some insight about the MFLB.   Lifetime Warranty - This is a big one for me. Many products have warranties for X amount of time but the fact that Magic Flight backs it for life says a lot about their dedication to not only their product, but their customer.  Learning Curve - It does take awhile to get the hang of the MFLB, but worth it when you do. Accessories - There are a lot of these, and they are not always the most affordable, but I am happy to buy what I need (FG, Battery Sets etc) and pay the price because I think that comes hand in hand with the lifetime warranty and the craftsmanship of their products. MFLB Chores - I find there is a lot more work into casually using the launch box. Cleaning the trench, grinding finer than usual, charging batteries, keeping track of the brush, stem on top of everything else. Whereas many other vapes have very little parts to them.   That's all I got for right now. If you have any questions regarding the MFLB let me know."
vaporents,3d6buz,PissedInYourCheerios,2,Mon Jul 13 23:37:11 2015 UTC,Thank you much for all this. I will definitely keep it in mind
vaporents,3d6buz,THE_SPLOOGER_69,3,Mon Jul 13 23:39:20 2015 UTC,Get the MFLB off eBay. There's many repeatable dealers and you still get the valid warranty. I got mine for $76. All brand new
vaporents,3d6buz,Jexir-,2,Tue Jul 14 11:49:49 2015 UTC,If you get the magic flight make sure to buy some 2700 batteries. They hold a much tighter voltage for longer. Powerex is a good brand but really any brand will do

vaporents,3d6buz,HikaruEyre,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:38:24 2015 UTC,True! I forgot about the lifetime warranty
vaporents,3d6buz,themetallicslug,2,Mon Jul 13 21:39:30 2015 UTC,I found the MFLB to be a disappointment requires a lot of use to build a technique. As a first vape this may not be an issue because it's all you will know and you'll try to make it or just get frustrated and quit vaping. I generally only got one good tray per battery. I would try a second tray and it would start off OK but the battery would quickly die and I would have to swap it out or have a half used tray until a battery is charged. I don't have any experience with the flowermate so I can't really say it it's any better. Keep in mind the MFLB is a convection vape and you can vape on demand with out having to worry about the material in you chamber going stale. The Flowermate is a conduction vape which is usually better to complete a chamber in a vaping session.
vaporents,3d4r9i,gigarob,10,Mon Jul 13 14:50:05 2015 UTC,Sounds like either the Lotus or the Firefly will work nicely for you.  They both hold around 0.15-0.2g max and work with lighter loads. They also don't require a fine grind to function well. The Lotus uses a torch and is the closest thing to replicating the classic pipe experience I've found so far. The Firefly runs on a battery that will give about 45 mins of use depending on how trigger happy you are with your heater button during your draw. The battery recharges in 45 minutes so if you pick up a spare and an external charger you can always have a battery ready. Both are extremely efficient and deliver delicious vapor.

vaporents,3d4r9i,HikaruEyre,3,Mon Jul 13 16:25:34 2015 UTC,"I used a metal one-hitter for years and it's what kept me off from vaping for a while because compared to a one hitter, vapes required so much more effort just to get high. Batteries, grinding herb, cleaning constantly, etc. isn't REALLY a big deal but it's still more effort needed than stuffing a bit of bud in the end of a bat and lighting it.   After a bunch of research I went the log vape (Underdog) route myself and I'm SO glad I did. It is THE closest vaping experience I can find to a one hitter. Stuffing legit half as much into a stem as I would a one hitter and getting waaaay higher than I would off the one hitter is just an added bonus. I still use my Pax everyday for work but the 10 minutes it takes me to grind, pack and get it ready for the next day is a really vexxing ritual I hope to be rid of some day. Currently looking into a Grasshopper as my Pax replacement but I'm holding off a little while longer.  Also, there are portable battery packs people use for their Underdogs so that is a definite possibility. ALSO also, it does take 10 min or so to heat up so that might be a reason you WOULDN'T want to buy one. Good luck! <3"

vaporents,3d5915,thespacecowboy702,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:26:02 2015 UTC,"So I bought a firefly to test a while ago. Being that I know just enough to be dangerous when it comes to batteries, I wrote to their customer service team concerned about the life span of the battery itself, not to question how long before it needs a charge. It says on the website that the battery life is rated for 50 hits before it needs a charge, while their instructions describe what they like to call surfing. Knowing I surely like larger hits than whatever they used to test this was very concerning. So how many ""surfs"" can the battery do? No answer, nor do they want to publicize that answer. Not even going to get into that when the coil gets hotter, the resistance goes up which means it takes more power to heat it causing your battery to die faster.   Ok, so if my battery is constantly dying and charging, how does that effect the longevity of the battery? It was then that they recommended I purchase two and cycle them to get double the life out of the battery! Very cleverly worded to someone who doesn't know what they are talking about or who has a bong on their lap while typing. What was suggested to get a DECENT battery, not even great just decent was to buy 2 batteries and an external charger making this already premium priced unit cost nearly 50% more. I'm not paying more than $300 to have to swap my battery in the middle of my first bowl.   Other than that the Firefly is a fantastic vaporizer. Unfortunately it takes a lot of power to heat that coil that the battery just doesn't have. Going from 750mah to 770mah might give you like one or two extra hits but its so minimal that it isn't even worth mentioning.   So tl;dr the advice given to me by Firefly customer service was: buy another battery and an external charger.   My advice to you: get the 750mah batter because 20mah is fuck all of a difference."

Shit even drop one of those cubes into a creamy chicken ramen after you cook it and you'll be loving life

Use a poker and stick some in between some weed in a sandwich. Wrap a glob up in some organic cotton and put that in the stem. Use a painting brush to clean your grinder.

vaporents,3d1qzv,PussyOnTheChainWax95,8,Sun Jul 12 22:02:23 2015 UTC,Right in the backpack. The security guard didn't even move anything around. Open and closed the bag. I was ready for a story about how it's an e cig or wireless hot spot.

I stuck the other half in my cigarette pack for later and we proceeded to go into the park. I had never been searched that thoroughly upon entry to the park in the past, so I wasn't too overly concerned about it. I kid you not, the security person who searched my bag actually opened up my cigarette pack, held the half joint in his hand and looked at it and proceeded to tell me that ""some people try to hide their funny cigarettes in here."" (Those words exactly) Then he put the joint back in the pack and told us to have a fun day. To this day I still haven't figured out if the security guard a) knew what it was and didn't care? OR b) didn't even know he was holding one of those ""funny cigarettes"" in his hand as he spoke about said funny cigarettes. Either way it worked out in my favor.

The thai curry I ate later in the evening may not have helped either.   While I usually get allergies that cause post nasal drip, the nasal spray has helped prevent much of it in the mornings, so when a sore throat does happen, I try to find the culprit.   The good news is that I still remember previous vaping sessions when I didn't get a sore throat the next day, so its not like I'm doomed to that fate from the get-go but trying stuff like steamy water may be able to help in this case. Thank you! :D"

vaporents,3d5l35,muddybunny3,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:38:44 2015 UTC,"Halfway right here. Cold water will actually condense the oil vapor (cannabinoids, terpenes etc..) back into an oil. That means a lot of the good stuff is actually going to solidify and get stuck on your piece. That's what resin is as well, it just contains tar from combustion byproducts.  Using warm water will decrease your chances of the vapor condensing back to an oil, but anything besides straight to your lungs is going to lose potency, vapor density, and flavor. When I was younger and didn't know any better I used to attribute the wispy hits when I was using ice to the decreased volume in the bong but it turns out it was literally killing the smoke.     however, vapor is dry   Really? Water vapor from a plant is dry? What exactly do you think you're vaping?"
vaporents,3d5l35,thespacecowboy702,2,Tue Jul 14 06:08:43 2015 UTC,"First of all, you aren't vaping water, so there's no water vapor.

vaporents,3d0hhe,dudematt0412,7,Mon Jul 13 03:09:20 2015 UTC,I would think it would increase the amount of surface area in your lungs coming into contact with the vapour per hit.
vaporents,3d0hhe,skunkhunk,5,Sun Jul 12 14:44:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would. The surface area of your lung wouldn't really change, assuming that 1/4 retake of air would be equal to the 1/4 vapour exhaled. They would be the same volume, and so would have the same surface area. In the second breath, the density of vapour molecules is lower, as you've inhaled clean air to dilute the air in which the vapour is already suspended. This lower density would mean that you're actually getting less collisions per second between the vapour molecules and the surface of your lung.   You'd still get ripped though, as you're re-inhaling vapour which would otherwise be exhaled."
vaporents,3d0hhe,I_Like_Mary_Jane,2,Sun Jul 12 19:30:00 2015 UTC,"So If we assume that holding in vapor longer gets you higher because it has more time to absorb, then doing this would get you higher because it allows you to get some oxygen and hold in the vapor for longer"
vaporents,3d0hhe,High_Diver,2,Sun Jul 12 23:27:55 2015 UTC,"Actually holding breath bad feels aren't because lack of oxygen, but your body wanting to get rid of CO2 inside the lungs."

vaporents,3d0hhe,BleachedBacon,3,Tue Jul 14 05:59:04 2015 UTC,Answer to your question is yes. It also helps to absorb the cannabinoids. If you only hold your hit in for a few seconds the vapor wil fall still and the cannabinoids wil not be absorbed by the receptors. If you create an airflow by exhaling a little and inhale again the vapor wil be in constant movement so that the cannabinoids can be absorded.  In my experience if you exhale and inhale 4-8 times it wil be enough.
vaporents,3d0hhe,dudematt0412,7,Sun Jul 12 16:13:31 2015 UTC,"This is what I do. Take the vapor bong rip, hold for a couple seconds, exhale a little, inhale till lungs full, hold, exhale a little, inhale lungs full, repeat until no vapor appears when exhaling.   Then take another rip"

vaporents,3d0hhe,jack-dawed,2,Sun Jul 12 19:29:57 2015 UTC,I do this sometimes (usually when I'm pretty fucked up) just because it feels like I'm taking a bigger hit.
vaporents,3d0hhe,Quote720,9,Sun Jul 12 23:24:23 2015 UTC,"It has to do with the inhalation and exhalation process. The alveoli open when inhaling (and fill with vapor molecules), absorb and transfer to the blood while exchanging carbon dioxide (keeping the alveoli full) and then on exhale they release contents.  I imagine that there is additional vapor absorbed through leftover exchange on the exhale but most of the leftover either builds up in mucus or is exhaled.  The key for efficiency is ghosting smaller hits."
vaporents,3d0hhe,Typicaldrugdealer,2,Sun Jul 12 15:52:41 2015 UTC,I think this seems right. There's a point of saturation where you won't absorb anymore vapor so it's better to take small hits.

vaporents,3d0hhe,OrangexSauce,3,Sun Jul 12 21:14:49 2015 UTC,"so the study you mention says, 35% of vaporized thc is exhaled after 10 seconds. meaning more than a third of what you took in is lost to the atmosphere holding the hit in for 10 seconds. actually we dont know, if those 65% were absorbed linearly over those 10 seconds or if more likely absorbtion follows an exponential decrease (mass transfer). so we actually dont know if after 5 seconds its only 30% or if its already 50%. what we know is that after 10 seconds still one third is lost. one would conclude that a longer intake makes up for more absorption/condensation.  further the study states that only 57.8% of thc was extracted by the volcano on setting 9 (although they later admit that with stirring the load and taking an additional bag, like the manufacturer recommends, yield could be higher). so if one exhales after 10 second holding in, the total amount of thc delievered to the organism is about 37.6% of the starting thc content.  source: full study op is referencing  personally, whatever works and gets you high is legit. of course the longer one holds in the more condensation/absorption the higher. but holding breath for long is not very satisfying for me and i get backed real good even if i exhale giant clouds, which i do really enjoy."

vaporents,3d0hhe,r9dLaKe,2,Sun Jul 12 22:44:09 2015 UTC,I thought it was known that you should hold in vapor and not get any clouds from it because it's not like smoking where you have other stuff coming out when you exhale
vaporents,3d0hhe,somanyroads,2,Sun Jul 12 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"When I hit my Pax or desktop, I then take a deep breathe in through my nose and hold all that goodness in my lungs. Especially if I'm about start cardio it's really helpful."
vaporents,3d0hhe,followthedamntrain,2,Sun Jul 12 20:59:02 2015 UTC,How is cardio after vaping?
vaporents,3d0hhe,SandmanPC,2,Sun Jul 12 22:34:23 2015 UTC,"Great. I personally feel like I have better breathing, probably not true, but it certainly isn't worse. I swim, and after vaping I don't get tired as quickly (1 hour of laps) and my form is much better"
vaporents,3d0hhe,Pigsin5pace,2,Sun Jul 12 23:20:37 2015 UTC,"Hood info. I have trouble doing cardio to begin with because I can only breathe out of one nostril, so I guess I'll stay away from doing so while high."
vaporents,3d0hhe,Madmushroomz,2,Sun Jul 12 23:38:09 2015 UTC,"I'm still a big proponent of ""multi-exhale"" ie releasing a single hit through several exhales, with mini-inhales between each exhale to reabsorb what's left back into your lungs. Seems to work well, but it requires strong breath control."
vaporents,3d0hhe,munkyadrian,2,Sun Jul 12 21:02:21 2015 UTC,"I've heard that holding hits for too long (8+ seconds) will lead to vapor condensing in the lungs though, not more being absorbed, which is why it looks like less is being exhaled."
vaporents,3d0hhe,SativaSprunger,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:31:54 2015 UTC,"Those condensed cannabinoids have to go somewhere, maybe absorbed through mucus membranes."
vaporents,3d0hhe,burrito_lord,2,Mon Jul 13 10:00:53 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with your findings. I have been using my mighty for over 2 months now, and have just recently begun holding my vapes in for aslong  as i can. and i have to agree that the the feeling is so much more intense and faster. when i exhale at around 175-190, i exhaled allot of (not sure if called vapor or smoke), so i recently decided to hold it in to make sure all that good stuff saturates my lungs before exhaling."
vaporents,3d0hhe,torof,2,Mon Jul 13 03:02:13 2015 UTC,I feel if you exhale through your nose slowly you keep almost 100% of the vapor you take in. If I do get cloud they are very small.
vaporents,3d0hhe,DvnRlm,2,Mon Jul 13 03:02:37 2015 UTC,I have found that if I give my GF my exhaled vapor (mouth to mouth style) that she can get high only from that. I'm going to try holding hits in longer to see if I can notice a difference.
vaporents,3d0hhe,rorywilliams24,3,Sun Jul 12 15:32:53 2015 UTC,"Thats called shotgunning and its pretty popular with all the smokers in my friend group, can't even count how many times I've shotgunned dabs to a few of my lady friends who have lower tolerance."
vaporents,3d0hhe,DvnRlm,2,Sun Jul 12 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"You can increase absorption (slightly) by exhaling slowly through your nose. The sinuses will allow more surface area exposure, and therefore absorption, than you mouth."

vaporents,3d0hhe,BKLounge,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:19:03 2015 UTC,"For anyone with an arizer solo, put a camelback mouthpiece on the end of the tube. You can get them at Walmart for maybe $10. But it makes a lot of difference. It's like vapor escapes as the weed is heated up but the mouthpiece keeps it in so you'll get much better hits."
vaporents,3d0hhe,burrito_lord,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"That sounds interesting, could you explain more? Or even post a picture?"
vaporents,3d0hhe,m1kek9,2,Sun Jul 12 19:19:45 2015 UTC,"Well it pretty simple really, just buy a camelback mouthpiece and put it on the end of the glass tube. Vapor seeps out through the opening of the glass tube, wasting vapor. But with the camelback mouthpiece it stays trapped in until you open the mouthpiece with your teeth. Kind of like a sports water bottle"

vaporents,3d2qcl,r4cid,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:20:56 2015 UTC,If you extracted the reclaim from the stem into ISO then all you need to do is wait until all of the ISO has completely evaporated then scrape up the oil.   Make sure you evaporate the alcohol in a well ventilated area with no naked flames or pilot lights nearby.  The oil will work well. The reclaim from my Mighty is very strong but doesn't taste very nice.

vaporents,3d2qcl,Madkids23,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:05:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, mine don't. Depends on if you use it in the vape or not I guess.  I've never used my reclaim oil on a nail, but putting it on cotton and back into the vape has always ended in a good time."
vaporents,3d1x64,Geeoorrgee,4,Sun Jul 12 21:25:34 2015 UTC,i agree. keep those fine metal screens relatively clean though or your vape will feel seriously under-powered.
vaporents,3d1x64,aeburnside,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:52:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they can clog easily. I just know to give them a slight clean-out once the draw resistance gets too high.  I also let my stem stand for a while after i've finished to let the resin drip through the 4 glass holes while its still warm, or else they can clog pretty fast too."
vaporents,3d1x64,choochtown,3,Sun Jul 12 21:57:42 2015 UTC,I'm with you. Been using screens since day one.    Shitbits.  Ha.
vaporents,3d1x64,ChromeForty,2,Sun Jul 12 23:28:58 2015 UTC,Don't put a very fine screen in there or it will be easily clogged and it will restrict (the already big) resistance in a noticeable way!   The dome screen trick is the best one though.

vaporents,3d2mdi,simonchingon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:40:24 2015 UTC,"Comparing the list of products you posted, and the m4 kit, the m4 kit will be more reliable. It will also be cheaper, and the spare parts for the m4 are readily accessible on fasttech and also cheap. And it will give you better performance, the m4 coils are much better. Anyways, these batteries all die, my friend's lasted him 6 months, mine lasted 2 years. The battery you posted will also have a short life span. I recommend getting the m4, it worked very well, and the vapor patch is all stainless steel, no plastic like the parts you shared."
