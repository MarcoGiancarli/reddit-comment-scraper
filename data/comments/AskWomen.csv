AskWomen,3e2aod,BaltimoreSkyline,185,Tue Jul 21 12:15:51 2015 UTC,"I'm a psych nurse. I have countless stories. A fairly recent one that sticks out: I walked onto the unit to start my day and a patient approaches me and seductively says, ""Good morning. Did you know I was born in a light bulb?"" EDIT: spelling"
AskWomen,3e2aod,Beanpod79,96,Tue Jul 21 14:34:34 2015 UTC,"My mom is a nursing home nurse but at one nursing home she worked at, they started taking psych patients to increase income.  So they had a locked ward with psych nurses, but of course if they were shorthanded, they'd just bring in the nursing home nurses.  So one day my mom had to cover a psych nurse shift and the first guy she saw had AIDS.  His opening greeting was ""Hi, I'm going to give you AIDS.""  And then he did everything he could to accomplish that.  He'd try to claw her skin and then spit on the wound, pull out tubes and spray blood on her, etc.    The psych ward at the home did not last long.  :/"
AskWomen,3e2aod,IfWishezWereFishez,52,Tue Jul 21 15:21:41 2015 UTC,That's really scary. A guy like that wouldn't be allowed to stay at my hospital either.

AskWomen,3e2aod,LithiumNoir,30,Tue Jul 21 18:15:16 2015 UTC,Hmm you can't really just have patients chilling in 4-point restraints it can be allowed in serious risk situations but usually getting meds correct will fix the issue.
AskWomen,3e2aod,ilivetofly,28,Tue Jul 21 18:28:01 2015 UTC,"oh no, I meant initially get him restrained and calmed down enough, not leave him in there indefinitely."
AskWomen,3e2aod,LithiumNoir,49,Tue Jul 21 18:45:24 2015 UTC,The thing with them is that you can end up getting the patient more stressed since you have to keep them under observation and such usually sedative is the most humaine answer initially.
AskWomen,3e2aod,ilivetofly,9,Tue Jul 21 19:02:17 2015 UTC,"Well, in my facility we have an area we can put certain types of patients in when they are inappropriate to be with the rest of the milieu. Legally, seclusion is not allowed, but for safety reasons, we probably wouldn't have a choice but to lock the doors. Is the patient taking psych medication? Is this behavior a product of dementia? If this guy were at my job and not willingly taking meds, for example, he'd be taken to court for medication over objection. He'd have to be injected (as safely as possible) and after a few days would probably come around and start taking meds voluntarily and the behavior would (hopefully) stop. That's just what I think would happen if we had that sort of patient. If it were dementia-related it would be a little trickier because that's not so easily treated. If (god forbid) he assaulted someone and did serious damage, charges would be pressed and he'd be taken to jail, dementia or not. Keep in mind that you're technically supposed to treat every patient as if they had AIDS or some other infectious disease, but when they're actively trying to infect people, that's a different story. Honestly I'm not 100% sure what the solution is. I'll have to ask my coworkers tomorrow what would happen if we had a patient like that."
AskWomen,3e2aod,Beanpod79,30,Tue Jul 21 18:14:27 2015 UTC,But if they have dementia they can't control themselves right?? (or wrong?) so how is that fair?

AskWomen,3e2ppa,XXX_HighAvailability,7,Tue Jul 21 16:06:26 2015 UTC,"Attached as in romantically, I-want-to-date-you-now attatched? No. It was always very important to me to make sure we were both on the same page as far as FWB and not wanting a relationship, so the morning after conversation usually consisted of me calmly explaining that if they wanted to have sex again that was cool, but we weren't going to start holding hands or some crap like that.  But I do feel like I become closer friends with someone. There's an intimacy there that's hard to ignore, and once you've slept with someone it's easy to find yourself moving into their personal space without realizing it. One of my FWB that I hooked up with off and on for about a year and a half was diagnosed with prostate cancer (which was absolutely wild because he was only 24). I was hanging out in his dorm room as per usual one night when he haltingly told me that because of the chemo, he couldn't get an erection, and he started to apologize for us not being able to sleep together. I immediately reassured him that I was there for his company, not for his dick. Our relationship became a lot more personally intimate because I stuck by him through a lot of the nasty chemo side effects and just generally made myself available as a shoulder for him to lean on while his life was shit. Once they started weaning him off the chemo drugs, I was the first person he had sex with again. We never officially dated but we did have a very close friendship.  EDIT: I'm not sure which one broke my heart more, that he thought I only wanted to be around him for sex and wouldn't want to be around him when he couldn't have it, or the fact that he seemed so ashamed of not being able to get an erection. Very emotional night for him. I remember spending the night as the big spoon that time."

I spent a lot of time last year pining over a friend I didn't even want to be in a relationship with while we were having a casual polyamorous thing, and I got a lot closer to one FWB over the span of the four months we hooked up. Both were manageable situations because with both guys, we talked a lot about how we felt for each other. I got hurt by a guy I was dating casually though, because we were actually going on dates, so I thought we might be going somewhere.

AskWomen,3e2ldt,anothercrazycatlady,25,Tue Jul 21 13:57:06 2015 UTC,"I did. I'm still not sure how I feel about it.  The bride was the girlfriend of one of my ex's best friends. They had asked both of us to be in the wedding party and we had both agreed to be a bridesmaid and grooms man.   About 6 months before the wedding I broke up with my ex. It had been a shitty relationship that wasn't going anywhere and everyone was quite understanding. I remained friends with the bride to be, but I felt like she was avoiding me for months after the breakup.  We finally met up for drinks and she blurted out that my ex had tried to sleep with her a couple months before we broke up and they had just made out for awhile. This was a party she had thrown the day after my birthday, but I had gone home early because I wasn't feeling well. What a dirtbag. I was understanding at the time, and wasn't pissed at her, I had a couple drinks in my system and was focusing on how angry I was at my ex.  Once I sobered up I had a good long think about it and decided that she was a seriously shitty friend to not only act so inappropriately with my boyfriend at the time, but also to wait months until after I'd already broken up with him to tell me. I'm certain that the guy was cheating with other women the entire time we were dating, but what kind of shitty friend doesn't say something?  I sent her an email backing out of the wedding. Never heard from her again.   Edit: The bride had a very long history of cheating on her now husband. Everyone knew about it and it was somewhat of a joke to everyone in our circle. I may have made my email out to both her and her fiancé and told them that I didn't give a shit if they had an open relationship or if he was just a cuckold, but not to fuck around behind their friends backs with their SO's. Not particularly proud of that email... haha oh well."
AskWomen,3e2ldt,Monztur,7,Tue Jul 21 14:11:02 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry, that situation sounds so shitty. I think you made the right choice, she clearly didn't take your feelings in to account.   Did you detail why you were backing out in your email? This is what I'm struggling with- I just really, really don't support the relationship but I don't know if I even want to get in to that because I feel like it will just make the situation worse."
AskWomen,3e2ldt,Monztur,8,Tue Jul 21 14:16:14 2015 UTC,"This is what I sent, edited slightly to remove names and dates (can't believe I managed to find the email after all these years! lets hope she isn't a redditor)  I regretfully must decline invitation to your wedding and bridal party on --/--/----.   I laughed off that news about you and my ex when you told me on Monday because I had far too much to drink and my natural instinct is to be a doormat. But I have thought about it for the past couple days and I am unimpressed. It's none of my business what sort of arrangement you have when it comes to infidelity with your fiancé, and I think I was one of the few people who didn't judge you for your boorish behaviour in that regard. I always gave you the benefit of the doubt.  However, as your friend, I didn't expect you to have such a blatant disregard for my feelings. The lax attitude you have towards how your actions will effect other people is completely unacceptable. I discussed my relationship problems with you when I was having doubts about my ex because I trusted you, not to give you the go ahead. It's especially offensive to know you didn't even have any feelings towards him. He was just a body on Halloween and you were drunk. Personal responsibility doesn't cease when you've had one too many drinks. I couldn't care less who made moves on who.   Despite all that, I probably would have brushed it off and forgiven you both if you had just had some class and told me six months ago when I could have taken some action or salvaged some dignity. Instead you let me carry on for another three months, and look like the villain to all of our mutual friends when I finally had enough and ended it with him.  The fact of the matter is that I never would have done anything with your fiancé, regardless of my state of sobriety, your relationship status, or any other stupid excuse - because I respected you. I cannot support or be friends with someone who respects me so little.  I hope you can return the dress and/or find a replacement for your bridal party. If need be, I will pay for the difference on the dress.  Sincerely,  Monztur"
AskWomen,3e2ldt,Monztur,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:24:42 2015 UTC,"Good for you, lady. That is a very tactful way of getting your point across but remaining classy. Thanks for digging this up for me!   Luckily, no dress has been purchased or anything like that as of yet. That's why I figure if I'm going to back out, I should do it soon and just rip the band aid off, so to speak, before I really get deep in to this whole thing. I feel like it would make it slightly easier? I don't know :(  Thanks again!"
AskWomen,3e2ldt,Monztur,4,Tue Jul 21 14:30:26 2015 UTC,"I think in your situation it might be best to give less details, just say that you wont be able to do it. make up an excuse if need be.  It doesn't sound like your friend has actually done anything shitty to you personally, so I think it would hurt her feelings to tell her that you think she is making a mistake.   If it was me and I wanted to continue the friendship, I would bring up your concerns though... in a completely seperate conversation on a different day - AFTER- backing out of the wedding, so she doesn't put two and two together."
AskWomen,3e2ldt,SarahlovesChar,3,Tue Jul 21 14:34:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, I was leaning towards not having the time and money to travel since we are in different states. I really don't want to hurt her, so I think you are absolutely right.  I have tried to bring up my concerns when she is in the midst of telling me things that are, well, concerning... and she shuts down immediately. I don't hear from her for two days, and then she'll send me pictures of dresses or flowers as if the previous conversations never happened.   Thank you so much for sharing and for your advice! I appreciate it."

AskWomen,3e36uw,kanikkers,3,Tue Jul 21 18:11:15 2015 UTC,"I pay attention to where the fuck I am and who is around me in a public place.  This actually makes me really mad and I find a lot of people are pointedly inconsiderate about it. When I'm going through a grocery aisle and need to stop and glance at something, I pull my cart over to the side and check behind me to make sure I'm not blocking someone. When I merge into a lane in front of a truck I make sure that they have enough room to comfortably stop without hitting me, because trucks take so much longer to stop at a red light. When I'm walking on the sidewalk and have headphones in I'll take one of them out when I go through a crosswalk so I don't miss a honk if I went out too quickly in front of an unsuspecting vehicle. When I'm biking I make sure not to just shove my way into another lane when I'm passing a parked car, not only for my own safety but so drivers in that lane don't have to dangerously swerve to avoid me.  Seriously, folks, being aware of the space you occupy in relation to the world around you can be really helpful for those you're moving around.  EDIT: Whatever, I'm just gonna brag a bit, because I keep thinking of shit. Most of this comes up because my roommates do the complete opposite, which is inconsiderate.   I clean other people's dishes out of the sink so that the kitchen doesn't smell and people can use the pots and pans they need I turn off Netflix/the TV when my roommate is Skyping or wants to play League of Legends (Netflix especially ruins his ping) (I MENTION THIS BECAUSE HE NEVER DOES THE SAME FOR ME) I'm the guy that tells folks to keep it down when I know someone is sleeping nearby"

You can't be considerate of others when you act like there are no others around you, and I swear, people do that shit all the time.

He asked if the people in the pic were famous, I said no, it's just a silly picture. Then he asked if they were in a band or something. Again, I said no, it's just a silly picture. THEN he goes, ""Well why are they famous?""  I'm like, ""They're not famous, someone just photoshopped a silly picture of them.""   AND THEN he goes, ""But if they're in a band and someone is photoshopping pictures of them and putting them on the internet, how are they not famous?""  Dead. Fucking. Serious.  My mind was melting. I was like, ""Are you fucking with me? I mean, are you really being serious?""  Then he goes, ""They're in a band, and you told me they're not famous. I don't get it.""  It just devolved from there and turned into the stupidest shouting match of my life. I still don't fully understand how the whole conversation happened and then continued to happen."

One time I was just absolutely STARVING coming home from a long-ass shift on my feet with a super shitty vending machine lunch.  He was sitting home all day playing video games so I expected to arrive home to a meal- any meal, a sandwich would have been great.  He's still gaming and I wait an hour to put up my aching feet, progressively getting in a shittier mood because a) STARVING and b) he rarely cooks anyways (though he does other things to make up for it) and c'mon man, make your lady a damn sandwich!  So after an hour I storm in and ask him to make me dinner, please and thank you!  He takes his time whipping up hamburger helper, still gaming.  I take a shower and come back to find it scorching on the stove.  Burnt to a crisp, the frying pan was unsalvageable.  I flipped the fuck out.  I cried.  I yelled.  I questioned the whole relationship.  I contemplated breaking up with him, though thankfully I had enough sense not to say something too regretful.  He booked it to pick up some food and when he got back I tore into it, still fuming.  It's been one of the only fights we've ever had that turned loud.  It's been 3+ years since the incident, and we've been pretty damn good all the way through, but sometimes I think back to the hamburger helper incident and get so, SO angry.

He was working on that while I was doing something else, and then I hear ""..... oops.""  Turns out he'd been using the POWER DRILL instead of a hammer or something to put something in the frame to tie the picture wire around. He had been doing this on our BRAND NEW WEEK OLD MATTRESS. And he drilled straight through the frame, THROUGH THE PICTURE, INTO THE MATTRESS.  I was so angry I literally could not speak, and he was panicking trying to figure out how to fix it, because he couldn't get the drill out of the mattress. So then he goes for BOLT CUTTERS to try to cut through the drill bit. I had to inform him that such a thing would LODGE A JAGGED-ENDED DRILL BIT ETERNALLY INTO OUR BRAND NEW MATTRESS.  We eventually fixed it with minimum damage to everything and everyone involved. But holy shit, I could not fathom the series of very dumb decisions that had to come together to form that event.

When it came down to the last piece (he had eaten most of the other pieces) I told him not to eat it because I wanted to treat myself after I took my Physiology test. I even hid it in the back of my freezer.   The asshole ate it. He dug through my freezer while I was gone for 1 hour and he ate it because he was ""hungry."" I had plenty of real food in my fridge and freezer but he ate the one thing I told him not to touch.  We argue a lot, but it's usually constructive and semi-calm arguing where we don't call each other names or insult one another. This fight was different.  I wasn't mad at him just because he ate it, I was mad because of his deliberate disregard for what I told him not to do, not listening to me, disrespecting me by laughing at me when I was upset about it, and then his refusal to apologize. He kept claiming that it was an ""accident"" and he ""forgot.""   He also has a terribly infuriating habit of doing this sort of nervous laugh when he doesn't know what to say. At first I tried being calm about it, but once he ""laughed"" at me, it pissed me off and I started yelling and it escalated from there.

AskWomen,3e0fzp,timoni,14,Tue Jul 21 05:51:20 2015 UTC,"have entire dreams where I scream at the people I love because they just keep rolling their eyes and telling me I don't have reason to be upset.   I can relate to that so hard. It usually starts out calm and I try to explain myself, but they'll keep saying these things that just really gets to me (usually always what I fear they think of me), so I protest and from there it just escalates, while they begin to ignore me and and act as if I'm not even there. I'm just screaming at a wall at this point, having everything I fear confirmed and basically nothing to calm me back down but waking up in a screwed up mood.   I don't get angry fast (or at least stay calm when I am), but that would be one way to do it. It's what my mother used to do when she was still drinking. She was very good at playing the victim and throwing things back at you, making you feel like the villain.  Still have nightmares about that from time to time. Usually when I'm angry or frustrated at an unrelated event/person and it just kind of manifests as her in my dreams."

AskWomen,3e0fzp,Homie-wan_Kenobi,28,Tue Jul 21 13:41:05 2015 UTC,"...army has more power logistically. Wal-Mart is more accurate in what logistics it conducts. It tracks variables with amazing accuracy.   But Wal-Mart can't deploy an army into a hostile defendedish country. Wal-Mart is limited by roads and laws that slow down long drives.   Wal-Mart will use the highways, the army will make a highway in any damn terrain they want. I highly doubt they need ax highway. They don't require stoplights, speed limits, safety standards.   If the army needs a supply base in an ideal or convenient spot, they make one. You can stop Wal-Mart logistics with a F-350 truck. You couldnt stop the US army if you blocked every road and put a tank in every intersection. You would only slow them down.   Army logistics are unstoppable."

AskWomen,3e1nxp,gameplace123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:14 2015 UTC,"Depends entirely on the sufferer's intent and ability to do something about them.   I'm not going to spend time with someone who clearly has issues, but refuses to do anything about them. Either because they are too scared of coming out about them or because they don't see their issues as a problem (when it really is a problem).  My ex was trans (F2M) and he was depressed and manic, and he relied entirely on me to help him out with the issues. It quickly became a chore that I had to do over and over again, because they weren't getting any help from anyone else."
AskWomen,3e1nxp,ReceptionistAtNight,33,Tue Jul 21 13:59:00 2015 UTC,"Eh... it depends on the situation. Mental health issues is not a ""one-size-fits-all"" kind of classification. My mom is an alcoholic and bipolar and never seriously tried to get help. She would go to one AA meeting and then skip out on the rest. Wouldn't go to court-ordered therapy. My dad put up with a lot and they really only ended up staying together for so long because of my sister and me.   Honestly dealing with the kind of shit I've dealt with growing up with my mother, I'm very wary of dating someone who might have a mental illness other than depression. Or if they do, I have to know they are taking their treatments very seriously and regularly take their meds and go for their routine check-ups, and/or any therapy/counseling they need."

AskWomen,3e1nxp,TerminalStar,-20,Tue Jul 21 15:15:20 2015 UTC,Not at all. I have depression and PTSD which do sometimes put stresses on my partner. It's entirely acceptable for someone not to want to deal with that.

Honestly, it is good he is a balance instead of being equally kooky about nature and being outside as I am because it helps me get more focus on the things I need to do like paying bills and doing chores and stuff.

I need someone who is ambitious and wants to do what it takes to become a high level executive because that's how I am.  Must love dogs. Must tolerate or enjoy the things I love: electronic music, disney, books, vegas/gambling. Also, I wasn't looking for it but the thing I love most about my boyfriend is now not lazy he is. We have a very active life, always going places and have social engagements, concerts, events, etc that clutter our calendar and he never complains about not just getting to sit and do nothing. There's so many amazing things going on in this world that I hate missing any of them and want to do them all and he enjoys being there for all of it which I love. He's gotten to do/see things other people never will and he really loved all the things I plan. It's awesome!"

And addictive substance-free. My mom was an alcoholic, and my brother died from long-time heroin use, so I'm pretty triggered by addictive substances of any kind. No smoking, no drinking; they are just massive turn-offs and I'm totally willing to hold out for a guy who shares that mindset."
AskWomen,3e1nxp,pinkpixy,15,Tue Jul 21 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"It's more important to know your deal breakers: how many kids the person wants; religious or political convictions (and your tolerance for variance on these topics); whether the person wants to get married someday or not; smoking, drinking, other drugs use; financial stability; employment; sexual preferences, expectations, fit, and frequency; dietary and health opinions; perhaps other things.   Be flexible and open as much as you can, but first be honest with yourself about what you value. Don't settle for someone who has aspects of their core personality and habits that you cannot understand or outright detest."

AskWomen,3e1nxp,tickertape_disaster,4,Tue Jul 21 15:45:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how common this is but it's really important to me that a potential SO has a very critical and feminist understanding of the world and the way sex, especially PIV, functions within that. I'm not at this stage, but I'd need to know that a partner would be ok with never having PIV because of my experience of sexual violence at the hands of men. I'd need him to understand why. I know that my SO would, but like I said I'm not actually at that stage.  Each to their own of course and I'm not saying any man who doesn't have that isn't worth dating or whatever, but it's really important to me in anything I think will go long term.   Edit: also MUST know how to use a computer. Again not a thing that I think is a prerequisite for being a good person, but would drive me absolutely up the wall if he wasn't at least as computer literate as me!"

I'm not really interested in PIV (I'm all about the clit), and I'm simply not going to do something which puts me at risk of pregnancy when I don't even get enjoyment out of it. All the risk for none of the pleasure. Hell no.  That doesn't mean I'll never do PIV, but the guy has to be cool with it being a comparatively rare event."

AskWomen,3e1nxp,countchocula86,6,Tue Jul 21 07:25:15 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, no.  I was anticipating a challenge. I thought I'd probably be single/celibate for a long time while searching for sexually compatible guys but it hasn't worked out like that at all. It probably helps that I am quite kinky (dominant) and there are many kinky men who are interested in other types of sex rather than focusing on PIV.   If I was vanilla, I think it would be a lot more difficult, because vanilla sex tends to revolve around PIV."

AskWomen,3e1nxp,Mittenflap,2,Tue Jul 21 13:32:30 2015 UTC,Can you go more in-depth with what you mean by a feminist understanding of the world and sex?
AskWomen,3e1nxp,Mittenflap,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:04:00 2015 UTC,"Ummm, I dunno how to go more in depth without either writing 10000 words or you thinking I'm saying something Horrible About Men (I'm not I promise!)   I think a lot of the sex we (modern people) have and are 'taught' to have by the media (both porn and just normal media, and social norms) caters to the male orgasm and is very phallocentric, and almost always we use 'sex' interchangeably with PIV, when obviously there's lots of kinds of sex and not all of them involve sticking a penis in. I think while its (slowly) changing for the better - less and less people thinking sex is over when the guy ejaculates for example - it's still a problem. I also think the sex that specifically mainstream porn 'teaches' specifically boys and men to have is quite violent and has a high potential for injury to women as well as not teaching consent properly. I don't believe there is enough focus on consent in formal education or media messages (tho again feel this is changing).  I have experienced a probably above average amount of sexual assault and rape in my life, always by men and usually penetrative, and I believe that if we (modern people) had a generally more critical understanding of the way sex has been ingrained as phallocentric and were generally more concerned about consent, I'd have been saved lots of those experiences. Honestly the word 'triggered' makes me cringe now but that's the closest thing to what I feel sometimes when I think about having PIV. Sometimes!   I don't know how well I explained that lol :/ there are two issues though, one is a radical and impersonal understanding of how PIV functions and one is my personal feelings as a victim of sexual violence, and it's very hard to talk about one and not the other I think. AMA if that was confusing!"
AskWomen,3e1nxp,Mittenflap,0,Tue Jul 21 15:07:29 2015 UTC,"The word ""phallocentric"" really is a very apt term, and even as a guy (not that gender really matter, but still), I completely agree. If all the porn I've watched to is anything to go by, there is almost always a disproportionate amount of footage of nothing but penetration - 2 minutes of hands and tongues and 20 minutes of PIV, for example. The only times that pattern doesn't apply are when there aren't any men, and even then, you have phallic substitutes.   And I also do notice this among some of my guy friends I talk(ed) to. One thing I still remember very clearly was one dude boasting that he ""can fuck a girl like a porn star"" basically implying just PIV nonstop."
AskWomen,3e1nxp,picklesitter,10,Tue Jul 21 07:41:57 2015 UTC,"The thought of a guy 'fucking me like a porn star' makes my vulva hurt. I'm glad you get what I mean, it is nice when you say something like that and a Real Life Dude agrees :)"
AskWomen,3e1nxp,Frostatine,4,Tue Jul 21 08:01:19 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I don't think it requires some kind of ""sacrifice"" or ""Good Samaritan"" mentality or any of that to understand. It really is just logic and common sense.   It takes two (or more if you're into poly) to have sex, and if there is even one party who isn't having as much fun as you are, then there's something wrong. After all, the brain is the most important organ in sex."
AskWomen,3e1nxp,Mittenflap,2,Tue Jul 21 08:18:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, did it sound like I was saying it was a sacrifice? Haha sorry :D I wanted to get across that it's not only important that they be ok with it but that they know why, if that makes sense? I think that might be a general worldview compatibility thing though :)"
AskWomen,3e1nxp,Frostatine,2,Tue Jul 21 08:21:51 2015 UTC,"No no, you didn't imply that. It's just that for some, this is like a major change in paradigm.   The other thing that I remember - this is related to your comments about awareness of consent - is that the sex education I got in my old middle school (or maybe high school, don't remember exactly when anymore) had emphasized a lot on consent and usage of various contraceptives. I always thought that this was what the norm was in a typical American curriculum.   Imagine my surprise when I read about sex ed related posts here and my American girlfriend's stories - apparently my education was on the better end, and what I consider as a given is almost extraordinary."
AskWomen,3e1nxp,Sleipnoir,2,Tue Jul 21 08:28:56 2015 UTC,"I can't remember the word consent being mentioned at school once :( I'm in the UK and I think some schools do it, but then we also didn't get taught about periods til half the year group had started theirs and had to deal with it themselves. Not EXACTLY the same, but related I think."
AskWomen,3e1nxp,TheSurlyEmpress,2,Tue Jul 21 08:37:52 2015 UTC,"My teacher didn't use that exact word, but he did imply it heavily, saying things like never pressuring your partner to do anything, always seeking permission before doing something or seeking confirmation after doing something, etc."

And being a romantic idiot. But I get what you're saying and agree despite coming from the opposite direction.

Throughout your lifetime, you're likely going to meet dozens of people you have some sort of connection with, and not all of these connections will be winners, or worth pursuing. Love is not scarce, not a thing reserved for some fortunate lucky few. Nearly everyone can and will find it. And if it's just about the hook up, then that's even less scarce.

I have high standards, especially when it comes to personality traits, and I refuse to let society pressure me into having a girlfriend just so I can feel ""normal."" I'll do the long term thing when I meet a girl that blows me away. If that's going to raise a flag for some girls, so be it. There's enough people on Earth that I'll find a girl for whom that's a nonissue. I think a ton of people settle when it comes to finding someone, and I have no interest in doing that.

AskWomen,3e1p4q,throwawaysuzyqt,5,Tue Jul 21 15:05:07 2015 UTC,"I'm in a profession ""where they eat their young,"" so to speak.   I've encountered bullying not only in HS, but in college (by a instructor, no less) AND as an employee. I wanted to quit so bad but I learned to cope. I don't know how I do it to be honest, because when they were happening I just pulled through."
AskWomen,3e1p4q,abqkat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:52 2015 UTC,"From the ""real moms"" at the school all the time. I'm not real mom, but I'm a mama who loves 'her' kiddos. Some of the moms never left high school themselves. It's incredible - sometimes super sad sometimes really entertaining. But I've been harassed by them more than a few times"
AskWomen,3e1p4q,UnicornMeatTaco,2,Tue Jul 21 15:05:22 2015 UTC,"My old boss was horrid. Not so bad to me but to others should was a monster. The worst I got was ""don't ever touch the computer because women don't know how to fix them properly"" (it just needed to be restarted), and yelled at for plugging in new scanners without call IT for help.  She was terrified of lesbians and transgender people though, to the point where she would try to make them quit. She routinely would berate them about their performance until they had enough and left, and she kept it completely within the allowed guidelines so she wouldn't get fired. I hate her."

AskWomen,3e1p4q,muki_mono,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:24:18 2015 UTC,"It kinda kills me we use the word ""bullying"" to describe harassment when it's kids doing it to other kids."
AskWomen,3e1p4q,mario_sniffer,6,Tue Jul 21 13:39:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same. It's not any less harmful, and it shouldn't be considered something that is natural for kids to do to each other... which is always kind of implied in conversations about school bullying.  Also when it goes the other way around and adult harassment gets called ""bullying"" in a trivialising way."
AskWomen,3e1p4q,MordorsFinest,3,Tue Jul 21 16:48:04 2015 UTC,"Its funny, a group of girls used to follow me around and bother me in 4th grade, i dont remember the words now, but both my mom and the principal thought it meant they liked me."
AskWomen,3e1p4q,mario_sniffer,2,Tue Jul 21 07:37:07 2015 UTC,"Jeez, if harassment means they secretly like you, then... I guess those Catholic school girls that would follow me around the bus station and call me homophobic slurs just really wanted me.  I hate that logic, especially when girls are taught to put up with boys behaviour because ""he just has a crush on you"". Teaching women to confuse abuse with love? Way to go, society!"
AskWomen,3e1p4q,MordorsFinest,2,Tue Jul 21 07:52:49 2015 UTC,"Im a guy! They told me when girls make fun of you it means they like you. I dont remmeber that stuff too well, one girl from middle school once apologized to me for them bullying me...i didnt even remember her as a bully!"

AskWomen,3e1p4q,MordorsFinest,5,Tue Jul 21 08:57:21 2015 UTC,"Oh i have, i hated girls for many years. It changed a bit when i dated them. I think i only really stopped hating them midway through college when i realized guys can be evil too and i settled into hating humanity, and now that hate has more or less vanished and at this point most of my friends are girls. Weird stuff. Not that friendzoned crap either like actually friends."
AskWomen,3e1p4q,tickertape_disaster,3,Tue Jul 21 09:17:48 2015 UTC,"Once, when I was 15, I was coming down an escalator and there were 3 girls at the bottom just hanging out. They stared at me the whole time I rode the escalator. Not threateningly, but not friendly either.  When I got to the bottom and walked past them, I said ""what the fuck are you looking at?""  They followed me into shop and one came right behind me and pushed me, and they started trash talking me. The shopkeeper kicked them out. They waited outside the entrance, and kept calling out threats and insults ""Wait until you get outside, bitch"" and stuff like that. I just browsed the shop for about half an hour until they got bored and left.   I can look back and laugh now, because really it was my fault for starting shit. They were obviously ""tough"" girls and I should have known better. But I was pretty intimidated at the time. Though it was nowhere near as scary as the many times I have been harassed or intimidated by men."

AskWomen,3e1p4q,Isansa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I come from a neighborhood of fellow Latinos where basically there's a two-second rule for staring or looking at a stranger. Anymore than that and you're just asking for trouble. It's funny because since getting educated and working in a job with different cultures, I notice other people don't view staring as such a big deal (like some Asians). Shoot I'll be in the elevator, and a Chinese guy will just stare at me for like, 5 seconds. I have to repress that inner-street-tough urge haha."

To start with my dear mother, who liked to ridicule me, rile up me and my sister against each other, ignore us when she was pouting (including no food), and who hit me and threw things after me when annoyed.    In 6th grade, two girls almost got thrown out of our school for systematically harassing and physically harming others, sometimes me.    In 9/10th grade, another girl would grab my boobs/crotch on occasion and consider it totally funny, other people found it just worth some eye rolls. Would've looked different if that had been a guy. I hit her, she stopped.    One of the teachers in grade 11/12 was a total asshole, and I swear it was her greatest joy in life to have everyone afraid of her. A lot of grades dropped significantly.       Other fucked up things happened which would not count as harassment/intimidation.  And in general, if that counts, I was never particularly good looking, and I mostly got dumb comments for that from other girls and women. (The worst comment in that regard was from a group of guys though.)"
AskWomen,3e1p4q,imaluckyducky2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:40:22 2015 UTC,"Two female supervisors at a job I had years ago at a law school started a campaign of harassment/bullying against me, trying to get me to quit. I documented it but HR refused to do anything for me, so their tactic won and I did quit because no job is worth putting up with that garbage. They spread gossip about me amongst the staff and would confide to me that ""no one here likes you, you know."" They would micromanage me and constantly ""correct"" what I said or wrote, with lots of accusations about my tone. If I said ""have a lovely day!"" to close an e-mail it was obviously passive aggressive and snarky. I couldn't win. They would try to find me on my lunch break and order to me do things for them. My direct supervisor was sneaking into my office after hours and taking paperwork from my desk so I'd look incompetent and also doubt my sanity. I ended up hiding a webcam in a magazine holder and got pictures of her doing it.  I was also bullied by a female professor and an adviser in my last year of university. Again nothing was done. That experience messed me up and I am still trying to get my confidence back."

AskWomen,3e1p4q,MuppetManiac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:43 2015 UTC,"Most notably was from a female manager I had while working in sales at a high-end fashion store. Most people I interacted with - whether it was a fellow employee, a regular client, or a fresh face in the store - really enjoyed working with me. I wasn't pushy, gave my honest opinion, and worked my butt off making sure the sales floor was clean and merch was out and organized well. My manager would come up and berate me in front of clients, calling me stupid, lazy, incompetent. She would physically grab me and drag me away from my big spenders to do some merchandising, while she and another saleswoman would swoop in on my client (I would rarely get the sale, even if the client said to the cashier that I helped her). I could juggle whatever she threw at me on top of my normal daily duties, and it infuriated her. It got so bad that my customers started going off on my manager in my defense, to the point that they threatened to no longer drop their 10-20k/mo at my store. Every time I got defended or I put my foot respectfully down, things got worse and HR got involved (HR was incompetent).  She and HR got fired within two months after I left. Found out one of clients, who I still shop for on the side, was had an immediate family member who was a VP at corporate. Same client helped me get the job that I quit the store for too. :)"

Everything from random insults (sometimes muttered, sometimes shouted across the street) to social ostracisation, and even threatening behavior a few times.  I was a child in the '70s, and a teen in the '80s, so at least I didn't have to deal with a shitload of online harassment and bullying too.

We were really good friends and for some reason she just went crazy and started hating me (I've asked everyone what happened and no one has a clue), but she started spreading nasty rumors about me to coworkers and friends, it even escalated to the point where when I started dating someone (that she did not know at all), she made a point to contact him through a mutual friend and tell him what a mistake he was making because I was such a slut/druggie/bitch. I lost almost all my friends because of it, half of them maybe believed her, but I think most of them were afraid if they didn't take her side it would be them next."

AskWomen,3dycve,zipzap21,98,Mon Jul 20 17:55:10 2015 UTC,Maybe they did that so you would know there was actually lint and they weren't doing something weird to your hair.

AskWomen,3dycve,idwthis,89,Tue Jul 21 00:58:58 2015 UTC,"I get snarky comments all the time about my nails being long. I had to keep them super short because I played the piano as a kid and then I went to art school for college so I enjoy having longish acrylic nails now that I'm an adult and no one can tell me how short my nails have to be.  I think the worst one was where a woman stood behind me and told her friend really loudly that SHE has to work for a living so she could never have long nails like mine. Like I don't have to use my hands on a daily basis lol. Another good one was ""how do you put your pants on?"" which I initially took to mean that she thought I was super fat or something.  I get asked pretty frequently how I text on my phone and stuff. They're not even that long! People need to mind their own business."

Neither is an appropriate question regardless of someone's nails, but uh...how the hell do THEY do it that they're using their fingernails?!"
AskWomen,3dycve,crazy_dance,13,Mon Jul 20 19:27:48 2015 UTC,NO KIDDING! Like holy shit how do THEY do those things if they're using their nails like that??

AskWomen,3dycve,Skywhatever,14,Mon Jul 20 17:29:16 2015 UTC,"My sister, back in her 20's she had extra long pinkie nails while the rest of her nails were more within 'acceptable' lengths.   She had a few people accuse her of being a cokehead because of that. Apparently an extra long nail like that is good to get a bit of powder out of your stash and do a bump off the nail? I dunno.   Real reason she had long pinky nails? Her first born produced a lot of boogers, and sometimes it was just easier to use her pinky nail since it was the smallest, to help dislodge said boogers when the little baby aspirators couldn't get them out.   When I had my kid, she also had a lot of boogers, longer pinky nail totally came in handy for that."
AskWomen,3dycve,LilKingTrashMouf,7,Mon Jul 20 18:20:04 2015 UTC,I have long pinky nails because my pinkies are incredibly short and the nails don't get as much wear and tear as the rest

I have pretty full lips and when I was in 7th grade (age 12-13 for non-Americans) some boy in one of my classes told me that my bottom lip sticks out further than my top lip. Another boy found this very funny. I was like wtf are you talking about no way. Told one of my friends about it. She made me turn to the side so she could see. She agreed and also laughed.   It's not something that bothers me and it's so minor that I'm surprised anyone even noticed, but every once in a while when I'm doing my makeup or something I notice it.

AskWomen,3e0bx3,Orangulent,3,Tue Jul 21 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"Mad Max. The trailers made it seem like it was going be another generic ""white guy as the hero"" brainless action flick. Then extremely positive reviews of it started popping up everywhere labeling it a feminist film. I was very intrigued.  Loved it. Mad Max has got to be my favourite film of 2015. It's action packed but also smart, and it doesn't treat women as sexual objects of background characters to be saved. In fact the women are actually at the very forefront of the movie, and Charlize Theron's Furiosa is arguably the real hero of the story. 10/10 would watch again."

After a while, Piper and Alex got boring to me, but the personalities of all the other prisoners were so endearing and I loved seeing them develop! I binged watched all three seasons in less than a week, but honestly, season three kind of lowered my expectations again- I didn't like it!  Also, another Netflix produced show- Daredevil! I loooove superhero-related things (especially Marvel things), but I sort of had low expectations for it when I watched the first episode. But I was pleasantly surprised at how it was sort of the perfect television show I need now that Game of Thrones is on an off-season lol. I love how grungy and dark it is- it's just perfect."

Seeing Red go from the top of the food chain, to the bottom, and then crawling back up again was great (I still remember the scene of her popping the Russian lady's implant and laugh so hard), and there's so many other examples. And exactly! It brought up so many issues and showed how messed up our society could be- the Sophia scene in the third season made me boil with anger, and it still does when I think about it today!"

No way the dude would let the chick do the thing while he was off with the other thing and how did the dude even be in the spot with the stuff? I thought maybe someone had learned a thing after 3 books but I guess not. It made the whole thing semi pointless. And the part about the thing with the dude and the thing?

Almost everyone I know who owns a house/condo here got help from their parents—and they're all over 30, too. The rest rent, and most have roommates or live with a partner.  In SF, where I used to/will live soon, almost all under-40 friends who are homeowners  got the money from stocks/buyouts/other tech-related $$$. The notable exceptions are the second/third generation Chinese friends, who tend to buy houses much younger (under 30?) and usually with significant help (or pressure) from their parents.   But even the wealthiest of Facebook employees can have roommates. I know one guy who bought a 2.3m place in the Mission and still has two roommates. He's young and single, might as well, I guess."

Sometimes I manage more, but I make it a priority to get out at least twice. I don't work two jobs, though, so there's that."

AskWomen,3dxnro,niccolus,56,Mon Jul 20 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"Your original question was about fitness, but the next one is more on outlook on life. Please take this with a pinch of a salt, I am only one person on the internet:  Not doing something because you don't have someone to share them with, for me, reflects a personality incompatibility. Last week I walked 70 miles exploring the city I live in, I go to the cinema by myself, cook fancy meals even if it's just me etc etc. I'd want someone who wasn't fazed by a lack of company if they wanted to do something."
AskWomen,3dxnro,mini_blue,9,Mon Jul 20 18:34:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I would be unimpressed if a guy's reasoning for not indulging in fitness related activities is that he ""didn't want to do them alone"", and I'm a fairly social person."
AskWomen,3dxnro,nouvellefiasco,2,Mon Jul 20 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I would interpret that as ""open to being active but hasn't really been interested before"", not ""open to being active but it has been impossible because there is literally no one in his life to be active with"". That's not really a reason. It's nicer to do it with someone else, but that can be said about many things in life."

AskWomen,3dxnro,kayfairy,13,Mon Jul 20 17:24:35 2015 UTC,"My baseline is being 1) fit enough to be active for several hours at a time and 2) coordinated/athletic enough that you can easily become proficient at new sports.  So if you could already swim and bike and wanted me to introduce you to the world of clipless pedals, triathlon dismounts, and open-water swimming techniques--totally fine. If you didn't know how to bike or couldn't go more than 30 minutes--we're probably not compatible."

AskWomen,3dxnro,cupcakesarethedevil,2,Tue Jul 21 01:17:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, due to my height and complexion I've been accosted when venturing out alone. When I lived in Orange County, I used to ride my bike around the city of Orange. One Sunday afternoon I was politely stopped by some officers and arrested on suspicions of having stolen the bike. It wasn't until my mother can't to pick me up that I was released and then I had to bring back the receipt showing my purchase for the bike in order to retrieve it.  Another instance, a few years later, I worked in Westlake Village but had to commute to Los Angeles everyday. Looks like 45 minutes on Google Maps but with all of the traffic, it was two hours. So I found a trail down Augora Road where others were running. I parked my car and decided to go for a walk/jog to kill time. I didn't even make it a quarter mile from my car before a police car pulled up on me. The officer got out with his weapon drawn and asked me to lay down on the ground. I obeyed. He put his handcuffs on me while another car pulled up. They said that they had gotten calls of a suspicious person running. They asked for ID, ran my license and then called my job to confirm that was why I was in the area.  These are just one off's. I'm not that tall (6 feet) and my complexion is between Chris Brown and Derrick Rose in terms of ethnicity. So I've developed a sense of safety in numbers. The problem with the guy friends that I have is that they are all either married/engaged so they don't have time and making new makes friends in your 30s isn't as easy as you would believe in a city you just moved to where you know no one.  Honestly, it's only been four months since I've moved to San Antonio do maybe I need to give it time but the one guy whom I met that I consider a friend is married, so we spend more time emailing than anything.  It'll change eventually."
AskWomen,3dxnro,niccolus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:07:07 2015 UTC,"If you're interested then it's fine. I'll just want to be sure that you actually want to do the activities though, because I know so many people who are ""interested"" then when I try to get them to do something they'll be busy or can't be bothered. It's actually fun to introduce someone to an activity, and if you are interested I'd start now rather than wait for someone :)"
AskWomen,3dxnro,Amethyst55,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:11:18 2015 UTC,"Adding that I, too, wouldn't want a partner who was waiting for someone before experiencing these kinds of activities. I don't want to have to be someone else's sole inspiration, nor do I want to come up with all the ideas."

Instead, the goal is to have fun.  To many people see exercise as a chore. Personally, I'd rather date a guy who likes to hike than a gym rat.   On the other hand, living in a cold city, being outdoorsy isn't so convenient, and going to the gym helps with your body's exercise needs if there's no alternative."

BUT I feel that I should stress that while I do find nicely defined muscles and a sixpack very attractive, it still boils down to just a nice bonus if my SO has it. If he doesn't have a sixpack then whatever, I like him for other things (though I won't lie that his bear shoulders are not one of those things). If he decides to go on a diet to get more ripped I will appreciate it a lot and help any way I can, but I wouldn't want him to do it just for me - in fitness, you should always do stuff because YOU want to; do it for yourself, not for someone else.   If we're including the aspect of fitness mentality: it's important that my SO understands my passion for lifting, the fact that I schedule things around the gym and skipping it is not an option. Ultimately, fitness is a lifestyle and I don't think people whose lifestyles differ too much are a great match. Generally speaking, I wouldn't want to date someone who has zero interest in sports and being active. You don't have to be a powerlifter just because I'm into that, but you gotta do something - play football a few times a week with your buddies, bike, snowboard, run, do yoga, martial arts,..whatever makes you happy.   Luckily, my current SO, too, enjoys lifting. I'm also into yoga, he likes to hike, run and bike - all of those things are activities we can do together (to some extent, at least) and I love that.

I'm built in a way that I can go months without exercising and eating terribly and not put on a single pound, and that's pretty much what I've been doing this summer.  My boyfriend however is in great shape physically, we went hiking on our first date and he did wonderfully whereas I... pretty much cursed the entire way up the mountain haha. He has trained for marathons in the past and I've seen him at his physical peak and frankly he looked amazing. He's been working a lot more lately though and hasn't had time to work out at all, though he's asked me to work out with him neither of us have really followed through. So in my case, I look to be fitter than he is, but in all actuality I'm not. And honestly I am slightly more attracted to him when he's in great shape, but I don't necessarily except that of him and I know if he really wanted to he could get back in shape easily. But it makes me feel kind of bad because I see myself as a hypocrite since I'm only fit on the surface.  I guess you could say my issue is more aesthetic than physical. But I guess the point in trying to make is that no, it doesn't necessarily matter if he's fit or not, however he is in better shape than me so I'm not sure I'm qualified to answer."
AskWomen,3dxnro,rey_sirens22,4,Mon Jul 20 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"I'm the same way. I am exclusively attracted to fit men and they are attracted to me because I ""look athletic."" I definitely enjoy outdoor stuff like hiking and swimming, but I'm not very regular about it. I've been anorexic for years so I get tired easily but I don't say anything because I want to look tough."

I love swimming and being outdoors but my stamina is fairly terrible. My boyfriend expected me to be in great shape because I used to be a runner but I just can't do it consistently anymore. I'm glad he's so understanding though and we're both at a place where fitness isn't necessarily a central part of our lives, though we might try to change that soon (I'm getting a gym membership, yay!). He still looks great though so thankfully the attraction is not a problem at all."

AskWomen,3dxnro,scupdoodleydoo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:57:44 2015 UTC,"God I feel you on such an emotional level! I stopped running because of anorexia! One thing I don't generally like about physically fit guys is that they tend to want to be with a fit girl who works out like a badass and looks cute while doing it. You can't have both! That thing about girls ""glistening"" instead of sweating is a lie! If I'm gonna work out in not gonna look dainty and cute and I swear like a sailor so you are gonna get an earful if you want to spontaneously work out with me without giving me time to mentally prepare lol. Another problem I have with fit guys in general is that working out together turns them on, which is fine and pretty common honestly, but I need a nap if I'm gonna work out with you. I do not want to have sex as soon as I get home from the gym."

In the last two, we haven't been having actual endurance practices.  So I haven't been going as much.  I've gotten insanely busy with work and the house and don't go hiking as much as I used to either.  Needless to say, I'm out of shape now, and I've noticed that my knees have been hurting.  I haven't gained weight, but I know I've lost some muscle.  I've hurt my knees in the past and they've healed with no torn ACL or anything, but the aches are kind of on and off again.

But I also am not interested in dating a guy who is an obsessive exerciser, because that doesn't give us a lot of time to hang out together, and I don't want to date an obsessive eater either (for example, if you only eat things that you think will help you build bigger muscles, then I think that is obsessive). So there's got to be a balance.   In terms of looks, I think that the typical weight- lifter-body-type looks weird and unbalanced. I much prefer the way guys look when they build muscles from doing a sport or activity to the way they look when they're just trying to shape their bodies through weight lifting."

And, I guess because I'm shallow or whatever, I don't like dating fat or obese women. I'm a pretty muscular woman myself, and I prefer to be with petite waifs, fellow muscular women, or well-tones cardiobunnies - and all three body types generally involves exercise, not overeating, or both."

AskWomen,3dxnro,kellylizzz,3,Mon Jul 20 16:10:40 2015 UTC,"I think a person who is out of shape is saying a lot about where they are in life at this moment.  If you see someone who really doesn't look like they take care of themselves, that is a serious red flag.  If they don't care about and neglect their health and appearance it's a sign of disrespect.  And if they don't respect themselves enough to make an effort how can I expect them to respect me?    But let me be clear, this isn't all about six pack abs or 6'0"" height minimums.  ANYONE can have a good appearance if they learn good grooming techniques (use the internet, the information is out there), take some care in their diet, and get out for some physical activity on a regular basis.  Everyone is capable of that, and it does wonders for your appeal I feel.  I also agree with previous writers that it's more about similar activity level and eating habits than physical appearance.  If you want to sit on the couch and catch up on your shows every evening while I want to go kayaking or bike riding then we are going to have trouble.  And if we both have very different ideas of what tastes good and what restaurants to go to that's another undue stress on the relationship."

Just because I like my husband to have a beard doesn't mean he has to like me having a beard. Just because I don't eat strawberries doesn't mean he can't eat them. Just because I like somethings doesn't mean he has to like it.  Fitness is more of a lifestyle choice for some than for others. We have compatible levels of activity and expectations related to that. Hobbies, like hiking or running, are best shared too; but that isn't a requirement for everyone. We have compatible views on health and healthy lifestyles too, which involves general nutrition and overall health choices."

Do I care if they have a budgy belly or if their arms or ripped? Nope. But eating poorly and doing nothing is unattractive. My boyfriend has a belly and isn't overly toned but he's deceivingly strong as hell and plays baseball, walks the dogs often for an hour a day.

I have attractive, thin friends who are out of shape so bad that a 30 minute walk puts them through hell. My bf is technically overweight but he has so much muscle underneath that he can actually hike longer, bike faster, and push himself harder.   I would never date someone who couldn't hike 10 miles. If you hit 8, good for you, but I am not interested in dating or hiking with you.  Fitness = health = personal respect and responsibility.   I wouldn't date someone who couldn't maintain their own body because it shows a lack of something I need.   FYI I used to be 35 lbs heavier on a 5'1 frame. Never going back, never dating someone with that mindset either. And I am a ""chubby"" chaser. But think Bronson, not Chris Farley."
AskWomen,3dxnro,ApricoteGinger,2,Mon Jul 20 14:26:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the problem with this question (both here and on AskMen). There's being active and then there's looking good because you work out. Personally, I am very active. I bike at least 10 miles a day, though more often 15, and I have occasionally done more than 50. I regularly find that I have more energy than people in their early 20s who work out. But I am overweight. So if you are looking for a guy who can keep up with you, no problem there, but if you're looking for a sixpack, I'm not even close.  They really are different things, and I think each has its iwn merits in terms of attractiveness in a partner."
AskWomen,3dxnro,another30yovirgin,3,Mon Jul 20 14:55:10 2015 UTC,"Yes. Perhaps that makes me a shallow shitlord, but I find it very hard to be attracted to someone who is overweight. My longterm boyfriend is very fit physically, but has always carried a few extra pounds on his belly, there's no muscle definition there. In comparison, I have visible abs, though I don't work specifically to maintain them theyjust exist due to my body weight and workout regimes.  My boyfriend has better cardio tolerance than me, but pound for pound I can lift more than him (when comparing lifts vs body weight, I'm significantly smaller than him.)  It's never really bugged me. But earlier his year he gained 15 pounds after deciding he didn't want to go to the gym anymore, and it really killed my attraction to him. I love my boyfriend very much, but it just didn't look good. (And the fact he didn't seem to care made me emotionally unattracted to him, since we have discussed in the past how we feel partners owe it to each other to remain in shape to the best of their ability.)  In my opinion, barring extenuating circumstances, it's not hard to maintain a healthy weight, and since I've always been quit fit myself that's the aesthetic I am used to and find attractive. I'm pretty damn toned so I don't expect exactly the same as my partner, but I would feel taken advantage of in a way if he gained lots of weight and became sedentary while I'm still hanging around looking good and being active."
AskWomen,3dxnro,stumpsforscience,2,Mon Jul 20 15:35:49 2015 UTC,"Definitely. It goes beyond looks, though. Someone who's out of shape (or making no effort to get in shape) probably doesn't eat well and lives a sedentary lifestyle - neither of those things jive with me."
AskWomen,3dxnro,bacon_n_legs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:44:04 2015 UTC,"For me it is because it boils down to physical attraction AND being able to do the outdoorsie physical things that I like.  The man I'm dating now is very muscular, but doesn't run.  I run, but I'm not muscular, so for us it's sharing a common interest to be healthy, fit and active.  I cook for us all the time and it's always healthy and delicious.  I don't keep chips, cookies or any shit like that in my house and wouldn't like it if I had to in order to keep him happy.  In my life I've found that if I'm around fit people, it's so much easier to be disciplined, but if I date a guy that isn't into fitness and healthy living the way I am, I lose some of my discipline and put on a few pounds.  That's no good, so I've stopped dating men that don't exercise and show a clear dedication to healthy eating habits."

Ideally, we're just on the same page and the same 'amount' of exercising. My husband and I throw the ball around, that type of thing.

Fitness is a huge part of a life and a huge passion of mine and I need someone who at least tries to share in that passion. If he's sitting on the couch eating pizza every day when I get home from the gym, that's not going to be attractive to me.

AskWomen,3dxnro,ctrlcutcopy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:18:31 2015 UTC,"I enjoy exercise (going from two to three half-marathons a year in 2016!) and it keeps the blues away. I understand though this is not for everyone. Hell, I have days I'm dragging or take the occasional skip day. However, my SO can't be someone who won't take care of themselves.  So, while my fiance rarely goes to the gym he instead likes to do outdoorsy things: hiking, camping, rafting, etc. He's also the one to book us for festivals that are usually outside and involve a lot of walking. He's also the one who keeps us on top of eating healthy-ish and modern kosher (as I call it). In the meantime I try to make sure we take our vitamins. So, can he keep up with me on a run? No, but that's okay. It's not his interest. Would I go camping with a bush as my toilet with him? Nope! That's okay too.  We both have different ways of staying active, but most importantly we're making sure to take care of ourselves. I doubt either of us would be attractive to the other in the long run if all we wanted to do was munch on fried food and try to absorb the couch. So, it's more about having a healthy, active partner that's important to me."

AskWomen,3dxnro,invinoveritas10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"My last relationship really showed me what I can and cannot deal with when it comes to health/body type of my partner. I've always been attracted to men who are more built than others; I workout frequently, but I focus a lot on Olympic weightlifting and I prefer guys who are probably stronger (and look stronger) than an average guy, mainly because I'm built like that as well (quads for days).  While I don't mind if my partner is a little overweight (I am, not big deal), I find it very unattractive when my partner doesn't take care of their body, eats unhealthy the majority of the time, doesn't put for effort, etc., but I think the worst thing for me is when I just hear excuses about it all the time. My ex was like this - he was always extremely proud of the accomplishments I talked about in the gym, but if I asked him to join me or asked if he wanted to eat something healthy with me, there was always an excuse. It use to be a huge ordeal to be able to eat together... he wanted to order a pizza or some kind of food and after awhile, I just couldn't do that 3+ times a week. So it became me bringing over my prepped meal and him ordering out. It just didn't seem like something that could last for very long and while it wasn't why we broke up, it was an underlying issue of compatibility.   Overall, I never had to think about it too much until my last relationship, but it is important to me that my partner shares some of that lifestyle with me. I promise, I'll never be the most fit person in the room and I don't need that of my SO either, but it's important that we can find joy together (or separately) in our own exercise regime and be able to eat healthy together a majority of the time."

I want my husband to be in better shape, not for any physical reason (love him to pieces no matter what he looks like), but for health reasons.  It makes me worry when we're laying on the couch together and his resting heart rate is around 90.  He's lost about 40 pounds (so proud of him!), and is now starting to want to be able to keep up with me when I go for a run.  We're going to get some bikes and slowly work up to more high-intensity cardio, because he can only go about a quarter mile jogging before getting winded.    So it's mostly the desire for him to live a long and healthy life.  Don't wanna be a widow at 50, you know?

Before it didn't matter so long as they had a great personality and were  loving now it has a lot to do with being able to get off and other stuff I never thought about. Chubby is okay if you are active, but obese isn't. I want to know you won't be sick or dead at 40-50 years old. I want to know you have impulse control, as it can relate to other things. Plus if I am going to commit to you and only you...then I want to know that you will be alive, healthy, active enough to have fun with, and attractive enough to keep me interested. A Netflix marathon is great, but so is hiking and other adventures.

He already learned Spanish and French on his own, he's financially independent and debt free at 22, and now he wants to learn to play the piano and I know he will. If he says he wants to put on 10 lbs of muscle, he'll do it. If he says he's going to lose 10 lbs, he'll do it. I love that determination.

I've always been good at managing my issues, physical or mental, and they aren't that bad either, but I could tell my mental health was deteriorating to a point where I could no longer handle it or even hide it -- which is what I prefer to do, as I have not been diagnosed with anything in particular.   I also had been cutting for a while and my parents found out, though I stopped. Not realizing why I started in the first place, I felt like I needed to get help for that too, or else I'd get back to the habit."

Witnessed lots of terribly dangerous physical fights where kids snapped from normal to insanely violent in an instant.   I started having flashbacks to some of those fights based on different triggers. One day, I was proctoring a large group of standardized testers. All the students shuffling around in the room started to trigger me and I had a massive panic attack. It was scary.   A few months prior, a friend of mine had talked about seeing a therapist for PTSD. We had taught together for a few years. I decided to see a therapist and worked through my PTSD with her.

I got so tired of worrying about everything. Also my world was getting smaller - gradually had less and less energy to do things i used to love, and/or they'd make me anxious so i stopped. Making it through a week just about killed me. I physically could not do it anymore; I wasn't suicidal at all, but my body and mind were exhausted.

AskWomen,3dyhyh,quantmemaybe,11,Mon Jul 20 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"Thing is the answer has changed over the past 200,000 or so years.  pretty sure it was something like:  Drag her by her hair (I would like to have seen that braid) after bonking her on the head with a big stick ( I saw 20 million bc.  And not because of Raquel Welch -- for the dinosaurs ).  Buy her for 3 goats.  or   Steal her after killing her family/village.  Marry her so you could farm enough land to survive.  This usually happened after she got pregnant (I read an article that looked at marriages and births in puritan Massachusetts and something like 60% of couples gave birth within 6 months of being married.  and the average age was like 17).  Rape her after invading her country (look at the stories about the rapes that occurred after the Russians defeated the Germans.  Makes the Rape of Nanking look like a minor warm up act).  Date her, and all her friends and everyone else you were interested in, but get married before 20 or 22 or something like that.  Date a little but have sex when you do, that way you don't have to date a variety of boys because the emotional investment is really high since since sex is on the table from the 1st date.  Whatever you kids do now that you don't actually have to meet people since you can just order them on tinder or OK cupid or something.  Somewhere in there, maybe for most of it, who you got to fuck was transactional -- you were basically property and traded for something like an alliance, some turnips or some land- still happens a lot in Thailand and Burma and is the major supplier of trafficked women in the Thai sex trade.

I liked having class early and getting it out of the way + I get sleepy in the afternoon and liked to nap so I preferred going to class from 10/11-3 rather than 4pm onwards. 4pm classes were the worst for me.  Also life is insecurity. Just do all you can now (like have a budget and stick to it, don't be tempted to spend your loan money on dumb shit), and worry about the rest when they come.  Also make sure you look into financial aid. Go to a financial aid advisor at your school (you'll probably be able to call one up now actually if you go to your school's website)."

I'm taking five classes, and I feel like that won't be too stressful on me! I wanted to get afternoon classes, just so I'd have time to wake up and eat a healthy breakfast and workout at an early time prior to starting my learning for the day!   I filed my FAFSA earlier this year and I have my financial aide reports back already, it's just the money hasn't transferred over to the account card they've given us yet!

AskWomen,3e0375,Moosanthrope,4,Mon Jul 20 22:56:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, here's another tip about class times: If there's a class you absolutely hate, try to sandwich it between two classes you like, so you'll be forced to go and not skip it.

Kidding, but really. Whatever motivates you to get out of bed and go! (If you're paying your own tuition, that might help motivate you even more.) If you have a mental health issue, please talk to someone before it starts interfering with your daily life or your grades - you wouldn't let a wound go gangrenous before seeking treatment, so you shouldn't let mental health issues become unbearable before seeking treatment, either. Most colleges have free or low-cost counseling clinics - take advantage of them. Don't feel pressured to hook up just because everyone else does. If you like it, don't feel bad about it - just be safe! (And FYI, condoms don't protect from herpes!) Don't drink to excess - I thought I was impressing everyone with my (in)ability to throw back bourbon, but it was really just ridiculous and unhealthy. Now I'm a two-beers kind of gal Talk to professors during office hours. It will help you understand the material better, show them that you care (which can help with ""participation"" type grades!), and form connections that will lead to recommendation letters and job leads.

AskWomen,3e0375,turkeysrule,2,Mon Jul 20 23:32:44 2015 UTC,"If you have anyone helping you at the school right now, ask them if there are any resources or centres available on campus to help with anxiety and mental health. They'll be able to help you easily and discretely."
AskWomen,3e0375,Creativelicense,2,Mon Jul 20 23:45:27 2015 UTC,"Listen to this. I figured out everything on this list the hard way. Especially talking to your professors, they will hook you up big time if you take initiative.   Also, yeah, don't fuck up your GPA just because your gen eds are boring and you only want to do the minimum to get by. My top choice grad school specifically requested me to apply based on a writing sample, my GRE scores are well above the averages for the program, but I finished undergrad with a 2.9 because I didn't give a fuck about a lot of my early classes (and was dealing with depression) so now they have to appeal the university before I can be admitted.

They offer cooking classes in the college, too- I'm definitely going to go to those!   And I'm hoping that I'm never going to have the urge to skip class! I feel like the whole mantra of ""make the most of what I'm spending my money on"" is going to repeat in my head every day, and so hopefully that motivates me to do all I can!   Thank you for the mental health tip- anxiety has always been something that I've struggled with, especially this past year- I'm thinking it's mostly family stress, and so hopefully it'll calm down a bit when I go off to college, but I'm definitely going to seek out counseling! That was always something I regretted during my high school experience- not going to my counselors like I should have.  The college I'm attending has fairly strict rules against alcohol on campus, though that may be the same for every college- I'm hoping I don't fall prey to drinking too much!   I'm so excited to get started on classes, and I know I'm definitely going to be the one student to introduce herself to the teachers on the first day- I've looked all of my professors up on ratemyprofessor, and they all have fairly good reviews, so I'm super glad about that!"

If you're living in the dorms or resident housing don't bring everything from home. Pack for the season and get seasonal things when you visit home. I moved to college with two SUVs packed and moved out of the dorms with two suitcases. (Threw tons of stuff away). meeting people seems daunting because there's so much pressure on it. Seek groups that have similar interests as you but don't turn completely away from new things that may catch your eye. As for paying for things, tons of places around campus will have student discounts, and special savings nights, explore town and find them! Also look on campus for a job meeting people in your similar situation and make money at the same time :)  As for the school part, actually go to class, sit up front, ask questions, thank the professor when you leave and tell them to have a good day, take advantage of tutoring, writing centers, and academic counseling. If you feel overwhelmed, anxiety, etc... Go to the wellness center on campus. They have trained, licensed professions experienced in what you may be feeling.   Party scene tips: never let anyone get you a drink, when holding a beer bottle keep your thumb over the top, it's okay to be the most sober person there, know your safety options and way around where you're going, and have a plan to get home safely that doesn't rely on anyone else, always have cash for a cab and a cab number."

And I have a fear that I'm going to overpack, but part of me thinks that it's better to be overpacked than under- though I have my mom helping me keep my packing realistic. I've seen many lists floating around of a list of student discounts and I'm definitely planning of taking advantage of them! I'm really antsy about getting a job - I don't know where to start in getting an internship that lines up with my major and everything, but I'm hoping that's something I can figure out when I get into the scene on campus.  Again, thank you for the wellness advice! I feel like that's advice that's rarely heard of, because in my senior year, we were constantly brigaded with the whole ""don't skip class"" advice, but there was rarely anything about dealing with stress / anxiety / etc that came up.   My college had everyone go through a violence prevention course before we could register for classes, and though I'm sure a ton of people didn't pay attention to it, it had so many valuable tips that I hadn't heard of before! I think I'm going to avoid the party scene for the most that I can (I'm very introverted- I don't think I could handle a big party!), but I still hold all of the alcohol and party tips close because I'll never know when I'll be in that situation!"

AskWomen,3e0375,desolee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:56:41 2015 UTC,"I too say don't skip class, BUT, if for some reason you stop going to a class and don't want to go back, drop the class by the drop date. Your school will have that date in a schedule somewhere, if applicable. At most schools, if you officially drop by the drop date, you will get an incomplete, which either won't affect your GPA or won't hurt it as much as an F will. I never did this, but I remember how this process worked at my college and so many kids wound up with Fs that could have just gotten an incomplete. This will carry by school, so check with your administration. Not every class will necessarily work for you, so know how to drop if you feel you need to."

AskWomen,3e0375,whiskey_clit,2,Tue Jul 21 05:33:51 2015 UTC,"Definitely talk to your advisor, because s/he would know specifics, but usually you can't add another class past the first week. The drop deadline is usually 4-6 weeks from the end of the semester. Dropping that late should really only be reserved for classes you are doing horribly in, where you cannot salvage a decent grade and it will negatively affect your GPA.   My sister has been through college, and she had various classes where the teacher was horrible and I was always just like ... why couldn't you just drop the class?    Sometimes you will need to work through a class with a professor you hate. Most often, this is because dropping it would affect the classes you could take next semester and it would put you behind. It's good to learn to push yourself through tough classes and to learn how to help yourself learn if the professor's style isn't helping you. It happens in the real world all the time. You might be assigned a difficult project or someone on your team might not be helpful, so it's good to learn how to manage these things without cutting and running when it gets tough."

What I do is, I take however many pulls feel right, and don't even inhale fully sometimes, though once you choke you should pretty much be set for the rest of the night. but more importantly, you shouldn't have to smoke to have this experience! the best part about college are late night adventures with friends sober or otherwise! We also once were really bored and broke into the science building, went into restricted rooms, then broke into the art buildings and played an old projector with historical slides and saw some really cool shit, completely sober. college is a blast, and it's not the parties that make it, it's those boring nights with your closest friends"

And that's a good tip! I always end up choking or coughing on the smoke, and so that would be a good place for me to stop- because that was one big problem, too, my throat would be way too scratchy.

Make friends -- Find cafeteria friends, study group friends, club friends, etc. Just find friends. College can be miserable if you isolate yourself.  Have fun -- Do new things and have new experiences. College is something that not everyone gets to experience, so try to get the most out of it.  Don't worry about your major -- I switched majors three times my first two years and I still graduated in four years. Just focus on taking basic core classes, and you'll figure out what you want to get a degree in.  Don't take any ""failures"" too hard -- If you attend class regularly, it is REALLY hard to fail a freshman level class in most colleges.

I loooooved Crash Course in high school, and now that it's expanded on a variety of more subjects, I'm definitely going to incorporate it into my study routine!

College is a weird time. Everyone you meet in college is going to be a little bit insecure, a little bit immature, and a little bit lonely. Keep this in mind about your classmates when you see them acting in ways that confuse and upset you. Put yourself in their shoes, and really try to understand them. Instead of allowing yourself to be controlled by your insecurities, remind yourself that everyone feels the way you're feeling. Put those feelings aside and force yourself to connect with others."

AskWomen,3e0375,LadyHoundmaid,2,Tue Jul 21 04:25:23 2015 UTC,"If you feel like you can handle it, take on more responsibilities/become more involved in extracurriculars as time goes on. I've noticed that people who do more things tend to do better in classes because they manage their time better and are more efficient. It was certainly the case that the busier I was, the better I did in my courses and the better I felt overall.  Get sleep. Don't be one of those people complaining about having too many things to do that you average 4-5 hours a night. Most of those people just have not learned how to manage their time or have not figured out how many commitments they can realistically handle -- the lack of sleep makes it worse. Try to get 7-8 hours a night. Especially the nights before exams.   Honestly, all my advice will boil down to one point: try enjoy college to the fullest, but remember that it's a stepping stone for your future so don't prioritize instant gratification over long-term goals.  EDIT: A lot of people are saying ""go to class no matter what."" Generally, I agree with this. However, you will learn your optimal study habits over the years. There are some cases when lecture will be useless and you can spend that time more efficiently. For example, my organic chemistry professor used PowerPoint and written/verbal explanations for all our concepts. By that point, I knew I was a visual learner and class was not helping me at all. So, halfway through the semester, I stopped attending, got an extra two hours of sleep three times a week (8am class and I commute), started self-studying and joined a free study group (with a head tutor) that met three times a week in the evening. I ended up finishing the course with an A and with a better understanding of the concepts than I would have by forcing myself to attend lecture."

I'm looking into doing a variety of things on campus (one of the major things on campus is their radio, and I soooo want to be a host for it- just the applications aren't open yet!). I've been looking into the clubs, and I'm hoping to join the student government- along with a few other things! Though I think I'm going to add things onto my plate a little at a time, just to prevent overwhelming myself.  Time management is something that I definitely want to try to get worked out during my first semester- I've been horrible at it. I loooove my sleep, and so I'm definitely going to try to set aside a good 7-8 hours per night, just so I'm not a zombie the next day!   And that's a fantastic piece of advice- I'm definitely going to try to keep my future in mind and try to base major decisions on how well it'll affect my future.  In that case, I could see myself doing the same thing- just I'm worried that professors count attendance into the grades? I guess it'll be something I have to take into account when I get into the class and determine what I'll do from there, but I'll definitely keep that in mind! I've always been afraid of getting a lazy professor that doesn't help my learning in the course at all, and what choices I'd have in that situation."

It's okay to have crazy fun and hangout and party, but never let those things interfere with school. You don't want to be the person who is still in school even though all their peers have already graduated and have gotten jobs.   Also, your age group is the time when many mental disorders occur. If you're ever feeling extremely down, sad, angry, off, etc., don't be scared to get some help. It's better to catch it early than wait."

Granted, that may be a little overboard for most (I'm a busybody through-and-through). However, the time management skills that I was absolutely forced to learn have proved to be invaluable in grad school and life in general. Plus, I met most of my closest friends through work & that frat.   Edit: I want to add that I didn't start off that way. It took me a good 1-2 years to find a club that I liked, find a job, and get into my groove. My college had an ""involvement fair"" where every single organization had a table where you could sign up to join. I wrote my name down for absolutely everything I was remotely interested in, and then just weeded them out until I found my niche."

It would be if the people weren’t cruel and hell bent on hurting and discriminating against their neighbors, but that is often the case.  Slavery in this country wasn’t ended by a democratic process, it took the bloodiest war in our history to do so.  Segregation wasn’t achieved democratically, but by several rulings of the Supreme Court.  The South didn’t voluntarily allow black children to attend school with white children, the federal government had to send armed soldiers into their towns.  The South didn’t voluntarily stop lynching and murdering black people for trying to vote, either.   The Civil and Voting Rights Act were passed by Congress, but if you do some reading about the political climate immediately before and following, 1964 and 1965 were almost the only times those acts could have been passed.     The states didn’t voluntarily hand over bodily autonomy to women, it took a Supreme Court decision.   While gay marriage was legal in some progressive states, it took the Supreme Court again in Hodges to force the more conservative ones to afford their gay and lesbian residents a fundamental right.  So, is democracy a fundamental good? Absolutely not."
AskWomen,3dz929,jb4427,16,Mon Jul 20 20:53:13 2015 UTC,"The Supreme Court and federal intervention is part of our democratic process, is it not? Just because some places have to be forced to comply with that democratic process doesn't mean democracy doesn't work. I don't think democracy means ""majority rules,"" because sometimes the majority are oppressing a minority. But it does seem that in those cases you cite, it is the democratic process (elected officials appointing smart people who interpret a collectively approved constitution and issue rulings about violations of it) that worked in the end. Yes, sometimes the national guard has to protect the minority and force a localized majority to comply with a minority's rights, but the national guard after all has been commissioned by an elected government and is acting on behalf of the people."

If you have the means to go through fertility treatments, why not just adopt instead? Why are some people so determined to not just have a child, but a biological child? I don't understand it. Is being pregnant that important? Or having a child with your genes?  If all involved are adults and able to provide consent, I have no objection to incest. I think it's gross and would never engage in it myself, but my stance on all things sexual is if it goes on between consenting adults, it's not my business. Same reasoning applies to polygamy. I don't care if legalising same sex marriage does lead to legitimising a push for polygamy. If it's someone's private love life and everyone is able to consent, it's not mine or anyone else's business what goes on. Go crazy, you bunch of weirdos, I don't care.  Cats should be viewed as pest animals and it should be illegal to let them outdoors at any time. I don't understand why it is socially acceptable to let a cat outside, even during daytime. They wreak havoc on native animals, and it's how they get hurt. They need to be viewed as exclusively inside pets.  I don't think this is controversial on Reddit, but I'm also pro drug legalisation. I also am becoming really concerned at how much binge drinking is normalised and even celebrated in our culture. Alcohol is addictive and really damaging, yet society still views getting hammered as a fun and legitimate response to well, just about anything.  ""Everyone is beautiful!"" No, not really. Some of us are fuck ugly. And you know what, that should be okay. We still place way, WAY too much emphasis on things we can't really control (like our facial features) in society today.  We should be investing in research into early intervention with self-identified, non-offending paedophiles. If somebody realises they're sexually attracted to children but has not consumed child pornography or engaged in child sex acts, I believe society has a moral obligation to that individual, as well as to the children that may become their potential victims, to help them."

I think some cat guardians are just lazy and don't want to play with their cats a few minutes a day, so they let them out for exercise or whatever, where they wreak havoc on birds and the like."
AskWomen,3dz929,southernkitsune,2,Tue Jul 21 05:06:39 2015 UTC,"It's also really dangerous. That's how cats get fleas or ticks. It's how they get lost and end up in shelters. It's how they get into fights with other cats and get abscesses or FIV. It's how they get mauled and killed by dogs, and it's how the get hit by cars. It's a bad time all around."
AskWomen,3dz929,apriloneil,5,Tue Jul 21 05:23:08 2015 UTC,"My roommate and I are constantly defending our decision to other cat guardians. Some people very strongly believe cats need to spend time outdoors because of their apex predator mentality.   The main reason we decided to keep her indoors was she's deaf in one ear, so it's super unsafe for her to be out near roads. Every time I complain about my cat escaping outside, a friend of mine is like, ""Why don't you just let her? It's what she wants!"" I think part of being a cat guardian is understanding that is what she wants, but much like a child, it isn't what's best for her so she simply can't.   During a moving situation two years ago, my other indoor cat got lost outside and was mauled by a dog or something. I found her and it was awful. I don't think people realize that cats aren't the only predators around and how easy it is for something awful to happen to them."

But to just let it out the backdoor at breakfast and not care where it goes until dinner time is really irresponsible pet ownership, in my opinion. This goes tenfold if it isn't neutered or spayed."
AskWomen,3dz929,apriloneil,4,Tue Jul 21 05:41:18 2015 UTC,"For the incest one - I think (or logically to me) the reason behind it is because it can really create some fucked up offspring. How would you account for that? Since it's not between those two consenting adults anymore, but rather also the potential for another person to be brought to life?  Also, the cat thing, are you from NZ by any chance?"
AskWomen,3dz929,Girl_in_space,7,Tue Jul 21 03:51:47 2015 UTC,"I'm Australian. I daresay we have similar problems to NZ, in that we have an entirely unique ecosystem of animals that has been ravaged by feral cats.   And re: incest. That's an argument that could also be made against any couple at a higher chance of having offspring with congenital diseases or defects. Since we don't preclude them from reproducing, it stands to reason that we shouldn't legally disallow incestuous couples from doing the same. Perhaps morally, but it's such a minute section of the population, I'm not going to lose much sleep over it."
AskWomen,3dz929,apriloneil,4,Tue Jul 21 04:16:09 2015 UTC,"Not OP but I think that's not the governments place to regulate. If two related people have a higher chance of creating a disabled or ill child, and therefor shouldn't be legally allowed to reproduce, what about a non-related couple who happen to have corresponding genes which also put a child at high risk for deformity? Should it be illegal for them to try for kids too? It's a slippery eugenics slope.  (Note: Morally, it's another issue, and while I agree with /u/apriloneil that consenting adults should fuck whoever they want, I think having an incest baby intentionally is immoral. Just shouldn't be illegal. I have some fucked up genes myself and will not have biological children with anyone because of that.)"
AskWomen,3dz929,the_devils_bff,3,Tue Jul 21 04:21:50 2015 UTC,"I think having an incest baby intentionally is immoral.   I agree. I think incest as a whole is immoral and gross.

AskWomen,3dz929,slootfloot,7,Tue Jul 21 06:02:49 2015 UTC,"Well, I also think if it's best for the child not to be born, then it shouldn't be. And I find it personally extremely morally questionable to carry a pregnancy to term if the potential father doesn't want his sperm used to make a child, because it is a bigger burden and responsibility than abortion. Abortion should be made into a quick, socially acceptable solution to all pregnancies which aren't wanted by both parties. It's just returning to the status quo. Should you realize you want a child, have it with someone else or have it alone if you can support it. I don't think that should be written in any laws as forcing abortions would be utterly wrong in reality. It's just a personal moral stance."

Its not like my biology is like those of billions of woman, i wasn't born with the right set of genitals. I get that my life experiences differs (in many aspects even greatly).  Here is the problem though. It hurts many trans people if they are reminded of those facts. Every trans person i know would choose not to carry this burden of othering around. We had absolutely no power over being trans. We didn't choose to be trans. And it helps tremendously if people accept us as the gender we feel we are without the micro aggressive subtle messaging we very very often get (i suppose from people with a mindset like yours). WE KNOW we are different. Thank you for reminding me about it.  You know, you wouldn't lose anything by fully accepting trans people as the gender they are. Its not like we dismantle your own lived experiences by doing so. Every women is different anyway, so why making such a huge distinction with trans women? Is a women without uterus so different to you that you would make such a huge distinction? Or women with extreme cases of vaginismus (where the vagina is completely closed down)? Women without breasts? Women with PCOS? Bearded women (yes they exist)? Where do you draw the line? Is an intersex person that has a micropenis and a vagina who identifies as a woman a woman to you?

One of my friends pays $1400 a month because he has a good job that he works his ass off for, and his ex gets a huge chunk of it. They have joint custody, but because of his work schedule, he doesn't see the child more than 3 times a week. When he does, he wants to buy him gifts and such but he shovels so much money over to his baby mama already. It's just a sucky situation that good people get screwed over for because of all of the losers that have abandoned their children."

Child support should be for the child. Food, clothing, shelter. Baby mama lives rent free at home, so the 4 days a week she has her son, I don't see him costing her $350 a week in food and supplies. He's asked to cut it to $275 a week and he'd throw in clothes/gift purchases weekly and the judge shot him down saying that she can purchase those with her $350. She really only has him 1 more day than him, so by the end of the month, that's 4 days. How does that add up to $1400?"

You have the racists, and the anti-vaxxers, and the non-dysphoric ""trans"" teenagers on Tumblr... You can't help how you feel but come on let's have a bit of self awareness.  My most irl radical opinion: The world grew too big for us to comprehend, and unless our ability to process information increases sometime in the near future, any political system and Earth itself will collapse before its due because we simply lack the capacity to understand the world that is not around our own belly button, but we came to a point where what we do have global effects.      Second one, related to the first one: We have slowly created an environment of highly addictive things that ended up numbing ourselves from problems and things we, as humans, should care about. We have highly addictive food, we created a system of highly addictive relationships, addictive entertainment, what not.

On his best behavior, knowing he was being tested and judged, he couldn't manage to pass.    It's always struck me as odd that no one questioned the fact that he had three kids at home.

I'm also not a geneticist, but with my rudimentary year 12 level understanding of biology, genetic diversity is hella important in any population.

I think another person mentioned putting children in a boarding school so all education was equal. I also think uniforms should be mandatory. School is not a fashion show.  I especially think that the higher education system needs to be abolished and rebuilt from the ground up. Its outdated and becoming unsustainable. The government should not be subsidizing bullshit majors that don't give people jobs to pay back student loans. Handing an 18 year old a loan worth thousands and thousands of dollars is grossly irresponsible. I also think that college sports should be gotten rid of. People who like sports can form their own club if they want. In many states the highest paid state employee is a college football coach and that is totally insane to me. Not to mention kids get into college on sports scholarships and many of them can barely read, but teachers pass them anyways. That's unfair to people who actually have to work for their degree.  I think most tattoos are ugly and tacky. They tend to follow trends and will look really dated in 20 years. I don't see how people can decide to put something on themselves permanently like that.

AskWomen,3dz929,blackddaisy,12,Mon Jul 20 21:27:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but has Obama had to pander to black people? A lot of people have written analysis showing Obama pandering to white people to allay their fears that he'll challenge the racial status quo too much- and for most of his term, his speeches to black Americans have largely been the Bill Cosby-esque ""stop blaming others and find your family values"" sort of rhetoric.  Have Obama's policies made life better for black America? We're almost at the end of Obama's term in office and we're undergoing the biggest nationwide uprising of black discontent against the racial injustices of the system since the 60s- and his recent moves on police and prison reform have happened only in the context of those massive uprisings, protests, and riots.   Maybe Hillary will be different from Obama simply because women are a much less solid voting bloc than black America. Obama could rely on black America to vote for him because black folk in America almost uniformly vote Democrat and certainly vote for black Democrats. So, Obama could depend on black support almost regardless of his policies. Women, though, don't tend to vote on gender lines. Women mostly vote on class, race, and regional lines over any loyalty to their sex- and that was generally the case in the primaries in 2008, too. Hillary can't depend on women as a unified voting bloc, but I also don't think she'll have to pander to them more than other politicians."

AskWomen,3dyu8w,mayfleur,4,Mon Jul 20 18:50:49 2015 UTC,This is how I grew up. We would eat out once a week on Sunday to give my mom a break. I still eat out about once a week.
AskWomen,3dyu8w,lusty-gallant,2,Mon Jul 20 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"In my house we do the grocery shopping and cooking on Saturday/Sunday so by the time Friday rolls around we're low on food. Sometimes me and my family get lazy and just get takeout or something on Fridays, that or we just don't want to make multiple trips to the grocery store."
AskWomen,3dyu8w,sweetxsour35,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:01 2015 UTC,Does Chipotle count?
AskWomen,3dyu8w,BaltimoreSkyline,3,Tue Jul 21 00:16:23 2015 UTC,"I eat a lot of Panera and I'm wondering if this counts too. It's not really ""fast"" compared to a burger joint but it's still pre-made food."
AskWomen,3dyu8w,sweetxsour35,2,Mon Jul 20 17:54:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think so. It's ""fast casual"", as someone else described it. Also, calorie and sodium-wise it's comparable to a lot of fast food."
AskWomen,3dyu8w,flawlessqueen,5,Tue Jul 21 00:17:32 2015 UTC,Twice per year.  When I visit my parents I drive past a certain McD's.  I stop once on the way there and once on the way back.  I look forward to this.
AskWomen,3dyu8w,sunshinecliffs,2,Tue Jul 21 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"I love fast food, but my goal this year is to really cut down on how much I eat. I challenged myself to go without it this February and found that I really did crave it less after the first week! I fell off the wagon in April due to my life imploding, but I'm trying to get back on track. Ideally, I'd like to limit myself to once per month."
AskWomen,3dyu8w,sundermount,2,Mon Jul 20 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"I used to eat it a lot more often when my husband and I were both working. Especially when I was pregnant -- the smell of cooking foods made me super sick during my first trimester, so pretty much the only way I could keep food down was if I picked it up in a drive-through.  Nowadays I never eat fast food. It's a habit I'm glad I broke."
AskWomen,3dyu8w,Spoonula,0,Mon Jul 20 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"My sister is currently pregnant, and yesterday she told me that the only thing that doesn't make her sick is fast food and bacon. Not to sound mean or anything but she is already a big girl and I'm a bit worried... diabetes runs rampantly on both sides of our families. She is about 4 months in so hopefully she will soon get over that like you did."
AskWomen,3dyu8w,cactuar44,2,Mon Jul 20 17:34:53 2015 UTC,"I used to eat it just about every day in high school. I don't know how I didn't balloon up.  Now I try to avoid it but I cave and have some on average once a month (sometimes I'll go longer and sometimes I'll have it more often).  That's not counting pizza though. I have pizza way more often than that--probably once or twice a week on average, but rarely fast food-type pizza."
AskWomen,3dyu8w,fishielicious,2,Mon Jul 20 20:45:13 2015 UTC,"Once or twice a week. It depends, if I'm working night shift I eat way more fast food than I do if I'm on day shift."

AskWomen,3dyu8w,whosaidiwaspizza,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:47:55 2015 UTC,"Like once a week. I avoid certain places like BK which never fails to make me sick, but other places are fine. As long as you're generally healthy, indulging once a week isn't a big deal whatsoever. If it makes you feel like shit though, I'd definitely stop eating it."

AskWomen,3dyu8w,stumpsforscience,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:23:39 2015 UTC,"Fast food like McDonald's, Taco Bell, Burger King, etc? Probably once or twice a year.  Kinda fast food like Subway or other sandwich places? Maybe once a month to one every two months.  I order pizza maybe once or twice a year and it's always my boyfriend's idea, not mine.  I find McDonald's and other burger places to be pretty much downright disgusting. Never liked their food. I love taco bell though, but I don't indulge very often. If I'm feeling Mexican I'll go to a place that does semi-fast Mexican food, their burritos are all fresh ingredients. Fast food typically makes me feel ill,  and it's not cost effective. If I have groceries in my house I'll eat those.  Edit: As an aside there's way less fast food choices to pick from in Canada than America. Up north if you want a fast food chain burger we have McDonald's, Burger King, A&W and Wendy's.  In my time in America I've noticed McDonald's, Burger King, Sonic, In and Out, Carl's Jr, Jack in the Box, Krystal, Whitecastle..."
AskWomen,3dyu8w,DeyCallMeTater,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:30:39 2015 UTC,Rarely. But when I do...it's to In N out or Chipotle as another person has said! Or my local burger joint which I just ADORE.

Meat that tastes like cardboard, everything is sloppily done with zero care.  However I will go out for burgers at a nice place about once every 2 weeks.  Like for one of those grass-fed burgers at a restaurant."

Had a Subway this morning for ""breakfast"" because we had just got back from holiday and were feeling lazy. I won't lie, I felt kinda rotten about having that for breakfast but at the same time...I was really hungry and I haven't had a Subway in months! Plus it was tasty!"

Only when I'm with people who are eating fast food because for some reason I feel like they'll be offended if I don't eat what they are. And then I pick the most simple of items. There's just so much food out there that tastes better and is better for you.

I used to get those free mcdonald's things for grades when I was a kid and just would give them away because I hated mcdonald's so much.   The best thing at taco bell is the mountain dew.   I've honestly never been really that impressed with any kind of fast food. The best rating I can give it is like above average.

I gave it up for Lent one year and never looked back.  I still eat fast food on occasion but as I am driving to my destination, I consider what I could make at home that would be more delicious and more healthy.  Keeping track of your calories definitely dissuades me from eating more fast food.   I do eat Chinese buffet once a week.  That is non-negotiable.  lol.

I have to travel two hours tops to get to the closest fast food chain. If I´m lucky, I get to taste a McDonalds hamburger every three months or so.  However, I was recently in Tokyo! Ended up eating KFC, dominos and mcdonalds almost every day."
AskWomen,3dyu8w,socialcoocoon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:01:13 2015 UTC,"Depends really. I'd say once every other week, more if me and my SO put off grocery shopping. We order pizza or Jimmy John's a lot more often than traditional fast food"

I did not regret my decision at all.  But before that? I think I'll maybe get it once ever 3 months or so? I briefly lived a year in a town with no fast food, so it kind of broke my habit/craving for it.  Edit to add: but now there's a sub called MimicFoods and it was recipes for TacoBell style taco meat and also the spicy chicken burger from Wendy's and I am so going to make those and eat them myself."
AskWomen,3dyu8w,LilNym,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:24:18 2015 UTC,"Very rarely. All the oil and deep frying makes me feel so heavy and weighed down inside. Also, fast food doesn't really fill me up. But I do love having fries fromMcDonalds when I'm hungover."

I used to eat it all the time when that was what was for dinner but my mother got diagnosed with diabetes and so with her diet change I get the food I've been wanting for years.  Im moving out soon on my own to go to college and I'm hoping and already planning how to budget food. If anything I could buy all fruits and vegetable and then get a burger from McDonald's?

AskWomen,3dzmyg,dirtgirlbyday,34,Mon Jul 20 20:42:59 2015 UTC,Basically the same reasons as you. I'm just not at all photogenic even on the days I look amazing in real life. I also feel awkward posing for a photo and they always always always come back to haunt me on social media or in some other very public way.
AskWomen,3dzmyg,ilovethelionking,6,Mon Jul 20 20:45:33 2015 UTC,I second this exact reason. My two best friends are extremely photogenic and photograph better-looking than in real life. I try not to hate them for that.
AskWomen,3dzmyg,Maniacalmama,17,Mon Jul 20 22:19:37 2015 UTC,"I feel awkward posing, I never know what to do with my face and limbs, and it's basically impossible to take a good photo of me, posed or candid.

I try to avoid being in pictures as and when possible."

I have to take 20 or so  selfies for one of them to work :/   Couple that with the fact I was hideous up until I was old enough to realize I was hideous and that I was less than because of it, and I just hate having my pictures being taken by other people."
AskWomen,3dzmyg,indomito,3,Mon Jul 20 22:33:18 2015 UTC,"I feel like every photo of me is awful. I've actually started taking heaps of selfies to try and figure out how to stand and what expression looks good and all of that, and so I feel less camera shy."
AskWomen,3dzmyg,LadyWhiskers,3,Mon Jul 20 22:42:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not photogenic at all. I'm paler than a ghost so I almost always look washed out and the light catches my chin funny and makes me look like a neckless wonder.   Also, I'm a fairly private person by nature - at least when it comes to images of myself, I've been on the Internet far too long - and don't like other people posting my photo. I'll grin and bear it if it's important to someone I care about, but if it's just for everyday lawls I dodge behind the camera."

AskWomen,3dzmyg,1fthebeautifulpeople,5,Tue Jul 21 00:15:31 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, it's people taking random pictures and then posting them online.  I can untag myself, but some people take issue if/when I tell them to remove them or make them more private.  Why would I want an unflattering picture of me up for just anyone to see?  I don't like not being able to control what happens to the pictures.  And I just don't like having a phone/camera stuck in my face when I'm making a face around the food I just jammed into my mouth.  I don't like posed pictures, either, but that's more because I just don't like posing and forcing smiles."

Once I wanted to submit a photo of my department for a company slide show. Idk why, no one really cares. But of course, someone needed to take the photo so after a few moments of awkwardness, I volunteered. Maybe one person half heartedly suggested to take it instead, but I insisted. I took it, and it's such a great picture! Everyone looks so good and happy! I submitted it, but I wasn't in it. What a weird thing for me to choose to do.

AskWomen,3dy0qa,rofosho,2,Mon Jul 20 17:57:06 2015 UTC,Oh man! Well I am glad you are doing what you can! I have never heard of an iron infusion but it sounds kinda scary!  P.S. I love crushed ice but it's so hard to find these days! :)
AskWomen,3dy0qa,RunningUpThtHill,2,Mon Jul 20 18:13:12 2015 UTC,My school has this ice machine that made the best ice. It was soft enough where it was so easy to crush and didn't hurt my teeth.

AskWomen,3dy0qa,iberis,8,Mon Jul 20 14:03:01 2015 UTC,"I have ones that are made to be worn overnight, but I take them out everynight... it helps in case I'm somewhere where taking them out isn't practical, or I fall asleep with them in by accident, and they just tend to be more comfortable to wear for long days when necessary..."
AskWomen,3dy0qa,ayy2k,4,Mon Jul 20 16:48:00 2015 UTC,Yikes that is scary. You could pre- fill your contact case with solution and leave it by your bed somewhere. Then when you are feeling lazy at least you take them out and put them in there before you go to sleep.

AskWomen,3dy0qa,kanikkers,2,Mon Jul 20 13:57:51 2015 UTC,Maybe you should switch to dailies? You'll just take them out before bed and put in a fresh pair in the morning so you (hopefully) don't risk sleeping in them.

AskWomen,3dy0qa,taralala15,3,Mon Jul 20 18:40:01 2015 UTC,"oh I'm guilty of that too...I was told by a doctor NOT to touch my ear every again. Now I use a tissue when I finish my shower and dry the opening of my ear, it helps me and at the same time I know I didn't clean the wax inside. but seriously stop doing it, few years ago a tiny bug got inside my ear and I woke up in the middle of the night screaming like crazy and jumping up and down. wax helps protect ear it from everything."
AskWomen,3dy0qa,Zayinked,4,Mon Jul 20 15:54:06 2015 UTC,Oh god oh god. I had a tiny bug get stuck in my ear too..... The first day of my Junior Biology class. It was horrible.
AskWomen,3dy0qa,Moolemon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:22:03 2015 UTC,"did it leave your ear on its own or did you go the ER? I was screaming and jumping but I did not know where the pain is coming from, and on my way to the emergency room the bug got out...it all made sense"
AskWomen,3dy0qa,taralala15,2,Mon Jul 20 20:14:40 2015 UTC,"It was a tiiiny bug. I was freaking out and shaking my head because I could hear it buzzing, trying to get it out. I'm sure I looked like a crazy person, but I went to the nurse (this was high school, no less) and she got it with fancy tweezers or something. It was a scarring moment for me though."
AskWomen,3dy0qa,rit100,3,Tue Jul 21 06:21:01 2015 UTC,I was told (by the very unreliable source of a girl I lived with in uni) that I was supposed to clean my ears out. Are you not supposed to? I never have. Wax doesn't annoy me and I didn't see why I was suddenly meant to clear out this evil wax when all the humans before whenever cotton buds were invented were fine with it. She seemed horrified.
AskWomen,3dy0qa,taralala15,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:40:57 2015 UTC,"well you're supposed to clean your ear gently but you're not supposed to clean take all the wax out, because the wax main function is to protect your ear from everything. you know how your eye lashes from your eyes from random stuff, If you remove all the wax, you're exposing your ear to things that it can't protect on its own.   For some people the wax is just annoying (i'm one of those people). It took me years to be able to control NOT cleaning my ears after shower. Having had a bug incident few years ago, I'm telling you the pain is insane if something gets in there and you won't be able to tell what's going on, you're gonna be screaming and jumping and feeling pain and you won't be able to tell where the pain is coming from."

AskWomen,3dy0qa,_ism_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"The issue with your throat burning could have multiple causes, but the tech side of that stuff isn't something I know.  Now, the feeling of not getting enough nicotine is common. Has to do with differences in how the nicotine absorbs. It is much slower in vaporizers. Don't know the specifics though. Might be worth looking into if you are still interested in using vaping to quit."

AskWomen,3dy0qa,pinkpixy,4,Tue Jul 21 03:29:04 2015 UTC,"I probably shouldn't use lotions, sprays, or perfumes because it breaks out my skin.... but i use it anyway.  Side note: Your ear automatically gets rid of earwax/waste on its own and by using a q-tip, you're pushing earwax too far into the ear for it to clean. It can damage your ear drum. If your ears are hurting, you need to go back to your doctor asap. That can get pretty serious."

I've never had skin issues or eye issues so I assume it's fine?  -I drink hardly any water. I'm talking about maybe one small glass a day. I had a friend horrified I didn't drink 8 cups. I just drink when I'm thirsty. Sometimes it's 8, usually it's 1 or none at all. Even when I do intensive exercise I don't bother taking a water bottle because I just wasn't drinking it when i had one!   The worst telling-off I got was when I went to give blood. I'd been so worried about my iron, I'd eaten 6 bowls of cereal the day before. I go in, sit down, and she asks if I've had something to drink today. Fuck. I wasn't allowed to give blood. My iron levels were super high as well, I just forgot the whole water part!  -And my teeth. My dentist keeps telling me to floss, I tell her I will, and I try, it hurts, I stop. I've had reward charts in the bathroom, alarms on my phone, and my laziness stops me. I also open bottles of beer with my teeth (although I stopped after I learnt the desk trick), and I'm addicted to Irn-Bru, a fizzy drink we have here in Scotland."
AskWomen,3dy0qa,Moolemon,4,Mon Jul 20 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"The 8 cups of water thing is not really accurate. You should, over the course of a day consume 8 cups of water, but that includes the water in all your food intake. Also that number is based on averages. A 120 lb woman and a 250 lb man will need vastly different water intakes.   That being said, if your pee is darker than bud light, drink more water."

AskWomen,3dy0qa,pseudomuffin,4,Mon Jul 20 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"I'm positive the science is changing on the attitude towards cholesterol. Many Doctors seem to be unaware of this or are choosing not to ""believe"" it.  It seems it's not nearly as bad as they thought (surprise) and the cholesterol you have is not because you are consuming animal products.

Still, my cholesterol and my weight are definitely too high so I should probably start fixing that.."
AskWomen,3dy0qa,Lunacie,4,Mon Jul 20 17:33:11 2015 UTC,"Even if you don't want to do anything about the cholesterol, you should definitely look into the weight thing. It doesn't even hugely matter what sorts of food you eat, just so long as you are consuming less calories than you are burning.  High body fat ratios have been shown by loots and lots of studies to lead to not very nice things.   Edit: Perhaps try a calorie counting app like MyFitnessPal? Though that only really works if you make a lot of your own food, buy pre-packaged food, or eat from restaurants that are within the app. If you often eat out at fancy restaurants, it might not work as well."

AskWomen,3dy0qa,Lunacie,2,Mon Jul 20 16:19:11 2015 UTC,Possibly because you shouldn't be using soap on your face at all. My mother managed a cosmetic studio for years and when I turned 13 or so she asked me to stop using soap on my face. I never have since (62 yr old) and my skin has thanked me. I remove my makeup with baby wipes with aloe. Works great and very inexpensive. Saw a makeup artist recommend them.
AskWomen,3dy0qa,advicemallard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:55 2015 UTC,"Make-up removal wipes are so expensive. I think it's a conspiracy started by the skincare companies that you MUST buy them, meanwhile they get richer and richer from people buying 20 wipes for $10.  Even just washing my face with the heavy-duty cleanser I use doesn't get every trace of make-up off, but then going over with a toner does. Something as simple as witch hazel toner will get the rest of the make-up off. One bottle will last forever."
AskWomen,3dy0qa,alwaysboth,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:35 2015 UTC,"This is just normal make-up or water proof?

The mascara I just rub my lashes between my thumb and index finger a bit, don't need any pressure. Takes seconds until no more black coloring comes off of it.

You can't bring those insecurities on to your new partner, because they haven't hurt you. If you can't deal with that, you aren't ready to be in a new relationship. I get it, after I was cheated on and lied to, it took me 3 years to enter a committed relationship again."
AskWomen,3dydro,ronniejean1,2,Mon Jul 20 16:23:37 2015 UTC,"This is so true, I couldn't agree more.   I also think that it's important to realistically look at the signs of cheating and what's going on and be level headed about it. For example, my ex was super shady 90% of our relationship, so I knew when something was up - i.e taking his phone with him to the shower, changing passcodes and passwords, etc.  But my SO now doesn't do any of that stuff. He doesn't have any passcodes on his stuff, I use his phone/facebook whatever freely, he barely uses social media at all. Because of that I don't feel the need to check on anything or worry, or put my project my past experiences onto him. I don't see the same behaviours or warning signs, I don't have that gut feeling at all, so I don't let myself get worried if that makes sense.  I guess my answer is that it's not just on you, but your current SO as well. My SO now knows about what's happened in previous relationships so he makes an extra effort to reassure me without me asking. We are in a long distance relationship, and if he goes out with his friends, he will call me and talk to me on the way home every time. I don't know if it's necessarily a reassurance thing but I think that's part of it."
AskWomen,3dydro,squashedfrog462,26,Tue Jul 21 04:20:57 2015 UTC,"I have been cheated on by every person I have ever gone out with, but my husband. I don't think he would cheat.

It took years to build this trust, though."
AskWomen,3dydro,1fthebeautifulpeople,35,Mon Jul 20 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"These answers aren't helpful lol. Go to therapy, figure out if these feelings are triggered by your own thoughts or whether there's objectively something reasonable your SO can do to lessen this fear. If you have a deep seated fear of abandonment, it's possible the fears will be there regardless of what your SO does. The trick then is to figure out in therapy how to ameliorate those feelings by yourself by changing how you think and how you act on those thoughts."
AskWomen,3dydro,SebaceousSeabass,3,Mon Jul 20 17:08:06 2015 UTC,Thanks!
AskWomen,3dydro,blahblahblahcakes,7,Mon Jul 20 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"Thank you you for being so much more eloquent than my attempt! Like OP, my current SO is giving me no reason to be suspicious and he's very trustworthy.  I still have that fear though because it was a scary terrible thing I went through.    And for people to be all ""you shouldn't date."" or ""just be with someone who's trustworthy"", it's not that simple.  I was with someone I thought was trustworthy and it turns out he wasn't because he was super good at lying.   Any red flags that went up before we got married were about his family, never about infidelity... and yet.  So, yeah, I'm with someone who not only appears trustworthy now, but has also gone above and beyond to demonstrate his trustworthiness and commitment.  And I believe him, and I want to be with him forever, but sometimes things happen and people change and maybe one day he'll just be tired of us, or tired of something else, and something could happen.   Or I could go nuts and decide to become a jerk and hurt him.  I really hope not, and I think it's unlikely, but humans are human and you can't say anything about them with absolute certitude.  Loving someone and committing to them is explicitly stating that you're taking a risk on an unknown quantity and hoping it works out.  So for now, even with my huge fear, I'm trying to be the best, most honest, most trustworthy person I can be for him.  All evidence is pointing to him pretty much doing the same for me.  So, we hope."

AskWomen,3dydro,ApricoteGinger,5,Mon Jul 20 17:24:23 2015 UTC,"You just realize it isn't the end of the world and you have no control over it. If you are happy, satisfied, communicating, actively being the best partner you can be and they still cheat, then you know you couldn't stop it. So you move on.   If someone wants to cheat, they will, and you'll survive. Then you move on, give someone else your all, and go from there.  This is why it's essential to have a life and support system outside of your partner."
AskWomen,3dydro,Elleiram,9,Mon Jul 20 21:44:25 2015 UTC,"I'm dating a totally different kind of guy now, and the relationship itself is totally different, than when I was cheated on (multiple times)  He's given me no reason to suspect him at all. He makes me a priority in his life, and frequently tells me how much I mean to him, and I believe him.   You can ruin a good thing if you let the ""been cheated on"" stuff back in- then you're mistrusting a guy who's doing exactly what he says, coming off as crazy, and creating a lack of trust with him. It's hard sometimes, especially if it's early in a new relationship, to not fear cheating enough to start facebook stalking or whatnot, or checking to see if they're where they say they are, but those behaviors are relationship killers.   It's hard, but you need to start clean slate with the next person you're with. If there's any up side, it's that you know the red flags now, and if they pop up, hopefully you'll be able to recognize them and shut it down sooner. Just...don't go seeking them out, either. That's my advice."
AskWomen,3dydro,lurh,25,Mon Jul 20 18:17:41 2015 UTC,"By exploring what cheating means to me. The act of sex itself is not a deal breaker, it's the lying that I abhor. So if my current partner cheated on me I would have to see what motivated it. Did we have a misunderstanding of the terms of our relationship? Did he lie because of shame? Did he understand why what he did was wrong?  I have been cheated on before. It was painful but surmountable. I ended those relationships because the cheating was a symptom of a lack of respect and insecurity on the part of my SO.  If my current SO cheats, I would forgive him and renegotiate our terms. We are not monogamous, so the only way he can cheat is by not telling me about it. That kind of violation is possible to work through. An underlying lack of respect and care would be a deal breaker.  I would also suggest therapy. A lot of times a desperate fear of being cheated on is a sign of insecurity and a feeling of worthlessness. That's not something anyone should have to live with. Your life can be better and you deserve to love yourself."

If it's a relationship I'm only just getting into, one where the trust isn't necessarily established yet, I would reflect on what is making me worry about being cheated on - is the dude acting funny?  Doing something to set off my bs meter?  Or is it just my own insecurity?

I listen to [Mental Pod] (www.mentalpod.com Iisten) which is a weekly mental health podcast that covers all types of issues and has guest speakers share their stories.   I also listen to a lot of lectures on fear and anxiety that I find on YouTube. I'm at work now so I can't remember them off of the top of my head but if you shoot me a private message I'll remember to send them to you when I'm home.    In the meantime, I also want to suggest mindful meditation - it is incredibly helpful!! Only ten minutes, you can find them on YouTube and just put your headphones on.

In my experience those who have never been cheated on tend to fear it more than those who have been cheated on. I was cheated on numerous times in a past relarionship and it culminated in him giving me genital herpes; can't get much worse than that, kids! (Thank god it wasn't HIV.) My boyfriend has also been cheated on in the past. It's kind of a non issue for both of us, we've experienced it and it didn't kill us so we don't fear it so much. If one of us cheats, the other will likely find out, and the relationship is over, simple as that. Breakups suck whether there was cheating or not, and it obviously didn't kill either of us, so it's just another issue we don't worry about.  TL;DR - I don't worry about cheating because I don't live my life in fear worrying about things that haven't happened yet. I also don't worry about tornados, car crashes, nuclear bombs, etc. If it happens I'll deal with it at that point."

That concept is stuck with me now. I'll survive the heart break, if it happens again. I can just hope I won't be cheated on, and if I am, that he'll tell me up front and be honest about it.

AskWomen,3dydro,Debbie87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:43:41 2015 UTC,"I've been cheated on, this is how I deal with the fear:   Don't date dickheads. Don't stress. If he cheats, his loss.  Be an interesting person with interests other than a partner which helps with the 'his loss' part.   I wasn't always like this, I just got sick of the paranoia and anxiety and I am pretty sure my current boyfriend was too. My ex cheated on me with a woman he worked with, his work meant he had to stay away some nights so I never even suspected. They have a baby now. We wouldn't have lasted anyway so I'm happy for them, I just think he should have gone about it in a different way."
AskWomen,3dydro,brkd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:59:57 2015 UTC,"Someone else cheating is a reflection on their poor character, not weaknesses of mine or the relationship.  Someone of good character will deal with problems respectfully and directly instead of resorting to selfish deceit (I cheated once, a long time ago, and feel qualified to judge!).  Maybe it means I'm foolish for trusting someone who didn't deserve it but if that's the worst that can be said about me then I can live with that.  My respect for someone who does cheat plummets to the point where I don't actually want them around any more.  I have enough good friends who I can actually trust and interests to fill my life that I don't have time for shitty ones.  Most relationships fail and all I can do is my best.  If the other person wants to halfass it then that's their choice but they can go and find someone else to play with."
AskWomen,3dydro,grittex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:45:35 2015 UTC,"I don't fear it.  If I'm with someone who will cheat on me, better it happens - and sooner! I don't want that in my life, but it happening isn't something to be scared of. If I'm not with someone who will cheat on me, that's great (and also not something to be scared of).  I'm not in control of their actions and there's nothing I can ultimately do to prevent cheating. I can only be the best version of myself and bring that to the relationship, including trust and giving the benefit of my own insecurities and doubts. If I don't do that, then not only will the relationship likely fail regardless of whether or not they're faithful, in the worse case scenario where they are cheating, I haven't even learned anything."

AskWomen,3dydro,DmKrispin,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:55:39 2015 UTC,"If I thought my current husband was ever going to cheat on me, I wouldn't have married him. My first husband was secretly unfaithful. I had an inkling that something had been going on for years, but I didn't get confirmation of it until I had already started divorce proceedings for other reasons.  My second husband is a pretty damned awesome guy. Despite that, in the beginning of our relationship, I did have some insecurities and a bit of jealousy.  I knew that I had to nip that in the bud. I kept reminding myself that it was ok and normal for him to have female friends and interact with women socially. I have a lot of male friends, and I certainly don't want to have romantic or sexual contact in any form with any of them! I also kept reminding myself that he could easily have chosen someone younger, able-bodied, unfettered, prettier, slimmer, or better off than I, but he chose me. There has never been any sign of anything untoward going on and I finally realized that I could relax and be secure in his commitment to me. He's always been very open, honest, and no-nonsense, and after so many years in a highly dysfunctional marriage, it's a huge relief to me!"

AskWomen,3dydro,blahblahblahcakes,4,Mon Jul 20 19:29:31 2015 UTC,"I was just having this convo with one of my friends.  I'm terrified of my boyfriend cheating on me, because that's why my first marriage broke up.  Like, i really struggle to even hear/make jokes about it all these years later.  My unhealthy but successful strategy?   I play it off really cool with friends and family, but I tell my boyfriend straight up that it's my biggest fear and if it happened to me again, I wouldn't even try to work it out.  i'd just leave. I just sort of bury my head in the sand.  I don't snoop ever, but i do casually verify his whereabouts occasionally.  I operate under the assumption that he could totally be cheating on me, but until it becomes obvious, we're cool. I have worked really hard to position myself to never be financially dependent on someone again.  This way, my whole ""vanish under cover of darkness"" is even easier.   For some reason creating this safety net for myself makes me a little more fearless.  Perhaps it's just knowing I won't put up with it and that I can leave at any minute, makes me feel like i have more power.  I love my boyfriend and i want us to grow old and die together, but if shit went down and he changed into a cheating cheater.  I'm out.  So basically I've braced myself for the vagaries of life?"

Once you get used to the idea, pooping in the woods can be pretty peaceful actually: it smells a lot better than any public bathroom ever will, you can find a spot with a nice view and just chill out and look around you as you go.

So you should probably be ok picking up rocks that are just lying on the trail.  In my experience (unfortunately) the times you want to be careful are when you are in a popular camping spot (a good valley along a particular hiking route, for example) and you see a rock that's about the size of a big dictionary lying so it's a little in the ground, but not half buried. It looks like it would be the perfect size rock to use to anchor down your tent stakes, and it's not too far out from the trail.  Because in that scenario, there seems to be like a 50% chance that some lazy idiot has picked up the rock, pooped under it, and then put the rock back down over it, instead of digging a proper cat hole."

It's actually a crazy story because I was talking to him and he kept shrugging so I suspected brain damage... Turns out he didn't speak English... And the only language he did speak was Romanian, which is my first language.... A very random happenstance considering I live in Canada. So I had to translate for him and the paramedics, and was happy I'm first aid trained.    I've ziplined. I've been an art judge for an art competition (actually, I've had a LOT of jobs and they've all been varied so I sometimes feel like a jack of all trades. Everything from painting houses to bartending to sales to gardening to office work). I've moved a lot. I've experienced crippling poverty and homelessness as a child. I've had my artwork commissioned and my writing published. I've seen whales out in the wild. I've been on a train for 7 days in a row. I've flown out of country. I've committed a felony (it's apparently illegal to leave ashes in a national park... go figure that my dad's last dying wish would have me commit a crime!)... I've had to make the decision of what to do for his death alone. I've gone through PTSD. I've lived with my partner since I was 18 and I'm 27 now (this seems uncommon). I'm sure there's more!"

AskWomen,3dzgot,joannagoanna,4,Tue Jul 21 14:56:07 2015 UTC,"I do. I used tampons for a few months to let it ""settle"" then went back to the cup. Apparently some people have more problems with leaking when they use the cup + IUD at the same time, but I've been fine. You just have to make sure you release the suction before moving the cup to avoid pulling out the IUD, and check the strings after every period to make sure all is well. From what I can tell the only thing that can go wrong is pulling out the IUD... which you would probably notice, and could get another one placed ASAP."
AskWomen,3dzgot,innovativesalad,2,Mon Jul 20 20:40:05 2015 UTC,"I tried it for a while, but silicon cups were miserable for me, so I stopped. Both establishing and breaking the vacuum seal they need in order not to leak tended to yank on the IUD for me. I decided I didn't really need more horrible cramps in my life, so I switched to disposable Softcups, which don't create a seal. Haven't had a problem since."
AskWomen,3dzgot,HigHog,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:58 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I didn't even think that the vacuum might cause cramps. I already get terrible cramps... I'll look into the Softcup, too. Thanks!"

AskWomen,3dzgot,prettyorganic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:11:34 2015 UTC,"I have a copper IUD and have been using a Diva cup for the past year.  I don't use it every day of my period, just on the heavy days....this is my preference because I sometimes (often? ha) have a hard time putting it in and taking it out....I'd say I'm just not used to it, because it IS getting easier.  I'm getting the 'fold' down for when I need to cram it inside myself, haha.  So with an IUD, insertion isn't really a problem.  You just want to make sure that when removing the cup, you break the seal.  I can't comfortably fit more than 1 finger inside myself when removing it, so often I'll kinda smoosh the cup between my 1 finger and 1 of the walls of my vagina...you'll feel or even hear the seal break.  Then you can pull it out.  Sometimes I have to do the 'bear down' thing while squatting.  I still think it's worth it, despite my troubles, because I have a super-heavy flow and cups have been a godsend for me."

It's a very early draft, and I think it's fascinating to see where the characters grew from, but it clearly isn't where they were meant to end up. Nothing in this world can ever change the fact that Atticus Finch has taught me more about being a good person than anyone or anything else, and I will always think that it's a masterpiece."

AskWomen,3dzedp,fecklessreckless,5,Mon Jul 20 21:09:24 2015 UTC,"The Blind Assassin - Margaret Atwood   The structure of the book is just mind-blowing, as is the way you slowly piece together all of the interwoven plots to figure out what actually happened. Plus her prose is amazing, her characters are moving, and I find the juxtaposition of her 80-year-old protagonist writing a memoir of her teens and 20s to be really compelling.   One Hundred Years of Solitude - Gabriel Garcia Marquez  I don't think I have ever (or will ever again) read a more beautifully written book. The characters, the setting, the story - it's all a masterpiece. Ursula Buendia is also one of my favorite female characters of all time.   The American - Henry James  This might make me a little weird, but I find his super hamfisted ""metaphor"" for Americans vs. Europeans to be kind of hysterical, and I love all the meaningless hand-wringing. James definitely isn't for everyone but I enjoy him."

It's one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read, and it's an emotional rollercoaster! It's one of the few books I've ever read where I had to put it down because it hit me right in the feels so much. Even though it's written so amazingly, it's not difficult to read. You don't really have to trudge through it or go back because you didn't understanding. This book is a pleasure to read if I ever saw one!

It's all a matter of circumstance and I agree that yes, if your SO is being suspicious and sneaky and there are other symptoms of cheating then not having access to their phone can be the last nail in the coffin, but I don't think it can be a reason in and of itself to accuse someone of cheating."

Honestly it hurt breaking up with him but it was for the best, I just wasn't in the headspace that I needed to be in to foster that relationship and I knew he wasn't the one. My current relationship on the other hand, has taught me that happiness should perpetuate happiness. My current SO and I just recently started officially dating but we've known each other for years and seeing him happy in any way makes my heart soar, even if it's something that I'm not the biggest fan of. And seeing me happy makes him the happiest guy on Earth. I've learned that each other's happiness should be your first priority within the relationship and to put aside petty things in order to foster a happy and loving environment."

In college my buddy brought his iPad into the bathroom while he was pooping and me and a few others jokingly accused him of jerking off (he def was).

AskWomen,3dxnui,Moscadilia,5,Mon Jul 20 13:05:30 2015 UTC,Since I moved to a state where I had no friends or family I go to bars by myself all the time. They are local watering holes and there are lots of singles there. By now we all know each other so it all seems normal and fun and a weekly thing to do. I think you are overthinking it. Go have fun!
AskWomen,3dxnui,imaluckyducky2,3,Mon Jul 20 13:16:43 2015 UTC,I was just curious but I did have fun when I went over the weekend. It was fun bs'ing with the people watching the baseball game on TV.
AskWomen,3dxnui,lolihull,2,Mon Jul 20 14:04:53 2015 UTC,Yeah that's why I started going to start with. Since I had no friends yet I needed people around to enjoy the games or car races with. Now I'm just another regular and it feels like Cheers when I come in since I know most of the people there.
AskWomen,3dxnui,crazy_dance,11,Mon Jul 20 14:10:59 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is if you're there by yourself, then no issue if he is too. If you, or they, start immediately trolling other singles then that's a red flag.   Just go, have fun, enjoy talking with others, and don't have expectations.   One note...watch for rings. My husband goes out to happy hours by himself regularly. Just to grab a drink, watch a game, and decompress from his day. I'm good with this, we all need our time alone while still feeling like we're being social. He'll chat with people, people will chat with him, and he can be unintentionally flirty (mostly because he's polite and gregarious) so signals can be mixed. He never hides that he's married.  Just cause he or she has a ring doesn't mean they don't want conversation!   Like I said, have fun, be safe, don't think too much on it. Just enjoy."
AskWomen,3dxnui,Sol_Weintraub,2,Mon Jul 20 14:19:46 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I did pretty much. Had nothing better to do and didn't want to sit at home so I figured Id go have a few beers and relax.
AskWomen,3dxnui,crazy_dance,2,Mon Jul 20 13:53:40 2015 UTC,Define trolling for singles - is it not OK to talk to other people when you're there on your own and possibly looking for someone to date?
AskWomen,3dxnui,coffeeblossom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:07:57 2015 UTC,"No of course it is!    But when I get my evenings to go out  (we have a young kiddo so we have to do evening happy hours separately sometimes) I'll sit at the bar and I immediately get someone up on my side, before my first drink arrives, and if I'm not quite what they're looking for in conversation they move to the next single or group of ladies, and so on. They're not there for social time, they're just skipping from single person to single person like the bar is a grocery store for dates.  I think there's a difference between moving single person to single person until you get a bite, and going and letting things happen a bit more naturally. Making eye contact, buying a drink from across the bar, inviting someone to come up to you, and just being social and having fun."
AskWomen,3dxnui,SouthernAirTemple,14,Tue Jul 21 06:54:48 2015 UTC,Most bars have regulars that go to the bar by themselves. It's really very common. I go to bars by myself all the time.
AskWomen,3dxnui,iownakeytar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:13:35 2015 UTC,That's what I was thinking. If I stop out at the local watering hole I normally see at least one familiar face watching the game or chatting up the bar staff.

AskWomen,3dxnui,thirtyeightdays,6,Tue Jul 21 01:31:04 2015 UTC,"I mean, so long as you're not staring horny death stares at every woman that walks by, going to the bar by yourself is completely natural and normal.  I tend to go out by myself, usually to the local pub around the corner where I'm a regular recognized by all the staff. Relaxed atmosphere, not overly crowded, games and tv shows on the televisions. I've frequently started up conversations with men (who weren't regulars) I was sitting around, simply because I overheard their conversations and either reacted some way (laughter or a goofy face, usually). Conversations with the bartender are open invites, as far as I'm concerned, to talk too. I've also had guys sitting around me join in the conversation in similar manners. My usual bartender also tends bring out shots for myself and whomever I'm sitting around, so I've often started convos that way."
AskWomen,3dxnui,thirtyeightdays,2,Mon Jul 20 11:37:39 2015 UTC,Yeah that's pretty much what I went for. Just to get out of the house and watch the game on tv. It was fun to talk with everyone around me.
AskWomen,3dxnui,fisheye32,9,Mon Jul 20 14:17:04 2015 UTC,"I think maybe it depends on the context. If there's some event going on - like sports - and he's there, I don't think anything of it. Seems fine to me!    If it's a bar like, night time, loud music, people all dressed up, I'd probably assume he was on the prowl and I'd be wondering why he didn't have any friends to go out on the pull with."
AskWomen,3dxnui,DmKrispin,5,Mon Jul 20 14:18:51 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, part of the reason why I stayed away from the main bars down the road. They would have been crowded shoulder to shoulder and watching the mets gets spanked by the cardinals is bad enough. :("

Before I was in a relationship, I would often go to the bar to grab a beer and watch the basketball/baseball/football/hockey game. I usually went to the same place, and got to know all of the bartenders.   I would have no problem chatting with someone sitting  solo a seat or two down at the bar. In fact, that's how I met a few of my very favorite people in the world -- met my boyfriend in a bar too."
AskWomen,3dxnui,vehementvelociraptor,3,Mon Jul 20 16:26:32 2015 UTC,I figured I'd ask because I've always gotten a reception that it's weird. I just sat down and watched a baseball game and chatted with people around me.

AskWomen,3dxnui,blonderson,2,Mon Jul 20 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"Bartender here: in my experience, dudes out solo have pretty good luck meeting ladies out when they get into conversations with the bartender. It's really easy to incorporate more people into the conversation when you're talking across a bar. I've seen it happen plenty of times, and it's an easy way to respectfully start talking to the cute girls sitting near you, while avoiding forced conversation/awful pick up lines. To answer your question, no, it's not weird to see people sitting alone at the bar as long as they're not crying/talking to themselves or something.  Edit: addressed the actual question."

AskWomen,3e0ac5,30secs2Motherwell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:05:53 2015 UTC,"It's still there even if it is small-despite the obsession with big butts on reddit (I'm so sick of seeing squats as the answer to every single question a woman asks) small rear-ends are appreciated by some. I was surprised to learn this, but definitely relieved, because I'm not packing much back there."

AskWomen,3e0ac5,kitkatness,3,Tue Jul 21 00:28:42 2015 UTC,Not an SO but I had a friend I'd been friends with for a long time tell me how much they loved my blue eyes.   ...my eyes are green.
AskWomen,3e0ac5,Salticido,3,Mon Jul 20 23:43:38 2015 UTC,"Like your friend, I also can't tell the difference between blue eyes and green eyes."
AskWomen,3e0ac5,oatmealcookay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:53 2015 UTC,I've been told the same thing.
AskWomen,3e0ac5,imthebar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:21:16 2015 UTC,"I have also been complimented on my ""blue"" (GREEN) eyes.  My eyes aren't a light green, either, and if anything, they verge more on being hazel."
AskWomen,3e0ac5,kitkatness,2,Tue Jul 21 00:57:16 2015 UTC,"Mine are a full on olive green, so yeeeeah."
AskWomen,3e0ac5,pamplemus,0,Tue Jul 21 01:07:43 2015 UTC,my now-husband told me i had the most beautiful hazel eyes he'd ever seen.  THEY'RE BLUE. NOT EVEN CLOSE.
AskWomen,3e0ac5,thereturnofspongefan,4,Tue Jul 21 06:31:02 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know for sure, but my husband has told me I'm ""tight"" down there and I am 99% sure it's just dirty talk, moreover I'm almost positive this is the case for most guys who say this.  Vaginas don't vary in size all that much (not as much as penises, for example), it's mostly lubrication and arousal (or alternatively, childbirth) that makes a difference.  I'm pretty sure mine is standard, average-sized.  But pretty much every girl I know who feels comfortable talking about her vagina with me claims to be extraordinarily tight, like, beyond medical possibility (and they don't have vaginismus or any medical concerns).  I can only assume they got this belief from dirty-talking men, or possibly just not being turned on during sex.  One friend of mine, who loves to brag about her tiny vagina, hates PIV and doesn't enjoy it physically, so I'm pretty sure her issue is lack of arousal and lubrication.  The only time I do feel tight is when I'm not turned on."
AskWomen,3e0ac5,ohokmmhmm,2,Tue Jul 21 00:18:39 2015 UTC,LOL I have vaginismus so my vagina actually is abnormally tight and no man has ever complimented me on it because it's painful for both of us.
AskWomen,3e0ac5,sleepless_insomniac,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:58:38 2015 UTC,I've been told I have beautiful black hair. It's brown.
AskWomen,3e0ac5,tender_oni,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:58:54 2015 UTC,What? Is there something I'm not getting here? I don't think I've ever heard of anyone complimenting their SO on features they don't have. How does that make any sense?
AskWomen,3e0ac5,Sand_Dargon,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:10 2015 UTC,Someone once told me they loved my sense of style.  Yeah.....

AskWomen,3e0ac5,karl__drogo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:33:08 2015 UTC,My boyfriend tells me I'm smart and beautiful.  Silly man...he'll figure out the truth eventually  sob
AskWomen,3e0ac5,destria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:07:08 2015 UTC,My SO said I have a cute button nose too. Um I have a huge flat nose for my face and my nose is definitely bigger than a lot of girls'. Still it made me feel better about a part of my body that I've always disliked.
AskWomen,3e0ac5,30secs2Motherwell,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:00:30 2015 UTC,"My boyfriend has told me before that my boobs looked 'really big' that day. I know he meant it as a compliment but they're tiny, they never look big and I've accepted that-I'd rather he was honest and just said they look nice or something, because they look very nice regardless of their size."

AskWomen,3dzx9x,mandykat24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:23:14 2015 UTC,"Cut it off! That is my solution anyways... I have an appointment tomorrow and am donating 8-10 inches.  Now I do braids and buns mostly. I find if I can change my hair once or twice a day and shake out my hair I get headaches less. If it is particularly breezy I wear it down so I can feel the wind on my scalp, or maybe just do one of those little braids to get it off my face."

AskWomen,3dzx9x,CatTopia,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:11 2015 UTC,"I usually start with a ponytail, wrap my hair around itself and throw another hair tie around the mess and clip it up. It makes for a great/easy messy bun. It doesn't get pulled very tight either so it's comfy.  edit: also if you put it off to the side, depending on how much hair you have, you can see it from the front and it can distract from the ears"

AskWomen,3e0git,BaltimoreSkyline,2,Tue Jul 21 00:33:15 2015 UTC,I always ask on the first date if someone uses reddit. It might be a requirement (kidding) because I spend so much time on it. Don't want them to get jealous of reddit.   No one has ever asked me first. One guy asked for my name and I said let's wait until at least the fifth date. We didn't even make it to the second.
