CrossStitch,3e39mt,kyrandre,3,Tue Jul 21 16:57:45 2015 UTC,"Very very cute, great job.  If you don't mind one tiny suggest for future projects (If you do just ignore the rest of this comment, though I promise it's meant not as a critique, just as a pointer). You see how you have a bit of texture issues on some of your stitches? Some stitches appear slightly bumpier or stick out a little more? Working your crosses all the same way will fix that. It doesn't matter really which way you go first but if you go \ first followed by a / over it do that for all the stitches. It will make it even and  uniform looking. It just bumps a project from being really cool to ""oh wow are you a professional?"" because it gives that nice little pro quality.   Mixing the stitches can be useful if you want that texture though but it's something to be aware of as you're working your project.   You did a great job and it's a great project :)"
CrossStitch,3e39mt,goblinish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:46 2015 UTC,very cute! is it a TinyModernist pattern?
CrossStitch,3e3ggg,bluekoalabear,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:21 2015 UTC,"YES! They're absolutely adorable. They're 6x6 inches but the area you're able to cross stitch is 1/2 an inch away from the border so 5x5 inches from the center. It's easy to find the center as well on it (3 inches from a side) So far I've done two projects on these, and they're amazing! My favorite one is the Oatmeal color, I had to get all three colors tho."
CrossStitch,3e3ggg,redditreaderonly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:44:57 2015 UTC,I agree with them being adorable. I'm tempted to start looking for a project just so I can use one!
CrossStitch,3e3ggg,littlebigfoxx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:05:01 2015 UTC,I don't but it's cheap enough that (always with a coupon!!) I'd buy it and experiment.

CrossStitch,3e2y3g,valk212,3,Tue Jul 21 15:36:18 2015 UTC,My mom and I always just trimmed the edges to be flush with the hoop. We've both always left the back bare too. I've heard of people glueing felt to the back of their works but I've never tried that.
CrossStitch,3e2y3g,tallerthanblue,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:54:41 2015 UTC,I never even thought of just trimming it to be flush. Apparently I think about doing something different and all logic flies out the window.
CrossStitch,3e2y3g,Yavemar,2,Tue Jul 21 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"I followed this tutorial, but instead of fabric I used fusible interfacing.  This is pretty cheap at any craft store or Wal-Mart."
CrossStitch,3e2y3g,lightningusagi,2,Tue Jul 21 15:58:53 2015 UTC,That tutorial is going to be useful :) And the interfacing is a great idea.
CrossStitch,3e2y3g,picklelady,3,Tue Jul 21 16:15:47 2015 UTC,Here's a good tutorial on how I do mine. I opt to cover the back with felt (cut to size and glued instead of stitched) to avoid the frame rubbing on the wall.
CrossStitch,3e3xce,moo_moo82,3,Tue Jul 21 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"The number in Aida is the number of stitches per inch.   The pattern you reference is approx 140 by 220 stitches. On 14 count that's 10x15 inches. Your 15x18"" fabric is big enough, just barely. You'll be ok in a 12x16 frame, although you'll have much less than the recommended 2-3 inch margin. If you're going for something fancy, like an oval, you'll run out of room for framing.   Make sure you center your pattern carefully!  OR, do the 7x11 inch version of the pattern, and you've got lots of extra room."
CrossStitch,3e3xce,picklelady,2,Tue Jul 21 20:38:50 2015 UTC,Try plugging in the appropriate info into this cross stitch fabric calculator. You can specify how much you want around the edges for framing (I usually aim to have at least 1 inch finishing space and 2 inches extra for framing added on to that).
CrossStitch,3e3xce,blue_birds_fly,2,Tue Jul 21 20:09:41 2015 UTC,"If you centre your pattern, you'll have just enough. You'll have 2.5"" on each side (15"" wide fabric minus 10"" wide pattern = 5"" left divided by 2 for each side) but only 1.5"" on the top and bottom. So you'll have enough for the pattern but might have issues finding a frame the perfect size. This can be solved by adding a matte around the picture before putting it in a frame.  I'd suggest picking out a frame/matte first so you'll know you'll have something to put it in once it's done instead of finishing it and then realizing you can't frame it the way you want to. And be certain to centre the pattern as accurately as possible when you start as you might run out of fabric if you leave too much margin on one side."
CrossStitch,3e3xce,layerkate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:55:53 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for all the info, everyone. Seeing as I've just started dipping my toe into cross stitch again after many years I don't think I'm confident enough to get it centred properly - not to mention finding the right sized frame for it to go in! There just isn't enough of wiggle room for my liking so I'll give the 7 x 11 one a go. :o)"

I guess if that's the sort of relationship you have with your grandma, that's cool... but maybe this is the sort of thing your mom is talking about? Food for thought."
CrossStitch,3dvbco,pcversusmac,2,Mon Jul 20 17:33:38 2015 UTC,"It definitely depends on the grandma and the kind of relationship you have with her. I would never give any of the subversive cross stitch patterns to my grandmothers because they would HATE it. They would not get the joke or find it amusing. However I do have that kind of relationship with my MIL. I guess it is all about knowing your audience. But I think you are right, and it would generally be a very bad idea to give that cross stitch to your average stereotypical grandma."

Even if you substituted a color that is very close it would probably drive you insane to notice the difference in colors (at least it would drive me nuts).   I don't know my DMC colors very well so I can't say which other color is closest. Hopefully someone else on here can help you out."
CrossStitch,3dygdb,Witchymommy,3,Mon Jul 20 19:36:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I ran out of B5200 once while working on a piece, and thought I could use White for the remainder.  They're more or less the same, right?  Wrong.  I had to pull out the stitches and do them again with the right color, because even two shades of (supposed) white were too different to substitute for each other.  Any other DMC shade will have an even more pronounced difference if you mix it with the otherwise closest color.    I'd just hold out and pick up some 524 if you can.  Someone here can probably hook you up with some if you live too far from a place that sells it."

I too am doing a Thomas Kinkade kit right now (Little Mermaid 5x7) and I find that it is way more difficult because the patterns have lots of sections with tons of colors that only have one or two stitches. It is so time-consuming and so hard to see ""progress"" because there aren't really any solid blocks of one or two colors. I completed a Beauty and the Beast 5x7 and it was the same thing. It has made me totally afraid to try anything bigger - he has some GORGEOUS kits that are quite large and all I can think is, ""That will literally take me 5 years to complete.""  I admire your tenacity at taking this on!"
CrossStitch,3dupzw,mirrorvsrorrim,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"Totally agree! I didn't realise how many little stitches of colour there would be! That's why I started thinking about whether parking threads would be any good, but I don't want to try this halfway through my project. I started it months ago, probably close to a year ago now for my fiancé now husband, and it's maybe just halfway done! Very hard to keep motivated!!

CrossStitch,3dxiqa,iliketoarmdance,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:42:45 2015 UTC,Really? I actually just did some searching and found that - do you have the standard or premium version? To be honest I don't understand most of the the things that are on the premium version and not on the standard - I'm only going up from the lite version for the size capabilities.
CrossStitch,3dxiqa,iliketoarmdance,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:00:40 2015 UTC,"I just have the standard version (I think it was like $50 to bump it up to that after the free trial (which honestly would've been fine to stay with indefinitely if it had a save function)), and honestly still don't know how to use a lot of its bells/whistles. It's plenty for me to do the basics and fairly easy to figure out.  I wouldn't jump for anything more expensive unless you have a very specific need in mind that the basic doesn't meet. But seriously if there's a free trial version just stick with that for as long as you can, because it may turn out that you don't NEED to spend anything extra. Other than your time...which, with this craft, is a given."

They do ask for a min order of £40 though. I think this is what i will do when I can afford it. Hope this helps. http://www.athena-wholesale.co.uk/sewing-thread/needlecrafts/embroidery-hoops  As a side note they don't deliver abroad, but if you knew someone in the uk they could ship them.... (I'm guessing you live in the US)"
CrossStitch,3dw1jf,alex_of_doom,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:57:14 2015 UTC,"In the US, the best deal I've found is usually consumercrafts.com. If you're not going to make the $75 minimum order for free shipping, just register with the site's emails-- they have free shipping at $25 or even with no minimum sometimes.   I get my wooden hoops and 14 count plastic mesh from them regularly.   EDIT: I just checked and their price is now $1 each. I think I paid 67 cents each last time I ordered. That's a big jump!"

This is the first non-kit project I've done and the first I've designed myself, so I'm struggling with working out what font I want on the banner. I know I want to have ""Co-Op for Life"" or ""Co-Op 4 Life"" on the banner, but I just don't know where to begin with this.   Are there resources you guys use for picking a particular font? What font do you guys think would work best here? I still need to color the banner itself, so I want to make sure I get the font and text placement sorted so I can get it done before I add the remaining color.  Thanks in advance! :D  (I'm also thinking of adding Abigail behind Wendy's left shoulder there too as it feels a little uneven at the moment, but I dunno..)"
CrossStitch,3dsek1,sickduck22,2,Sun Jul 19 00:28:29 2015 UTC,"I usually start with ""What do I want it to look like?"" Figure out what art style you want. Art Deco? Modern? Classical? Block?

Also graph paper rules for life and would ne perfect to help you sketch out your design!

CrossStitch,3dto7k,DarkPizza,2,Sun Jul 19 10:20:56 2015 UTC,"I would like to stitch this on black aida, so I'd like it if the patterned part of the blue borders was removed, leaving just the interior white and blue part of the border. Also, to make a pattern the colors should be simplified, retaining the diamond design but making each ""section"" of color a single color of thread rather than a gradient.  Thank you so much for any help offered! Persona 3 is my best friend's favorite game and I think this would make an excellent gift, but the free programs I've tried to use aren't capable of performing much editing and I can't afford to buy one of the fancier ones.

CrossStitch,3dsp3s,thebobomb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:13:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think it looks uneven. I like the font choice, it matches the game. I personally though would move co-op and life closer to the 4. Maybe one ten line inward each (if that makes sense to you)?"
CrossStitch,3dsp3s,tabbicakes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:13:44 2015 UTC,Yeah that makes sense! I definitely think this is going to be a little trial-and-error to get right.
CrossStitch,3dsp3s,tabbicakes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:19:23 2015 UTC,What program did you use? It looks like the banner will be 2000 stitches wide.   I suggest using graph paper for this so it will fit on what you already have done.

I find if I watch TV I get ""bored"", even if its a really good show and end up on Reddit, Facebook etc. X-stitching seems to be the perfect amount of busy hands and minimal brain concentration requires that makes it easy to binge watch TV series...

CrossStitch,3dsw4x,TanRabbits,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:10:54 2015 UTC,Dude...forensic files. My absolute favorite thing to watch while stitching because you don't even really need to watch it. :)
CrossStitch,3dsw4x,fathovercats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:39:26 2015 UTC,Definitely. The narrator has this absolutely beautiful voice and I feel time passes instantly.
CrossStitch,3dsw4x,parachutekitten,4,Tue Jul 21 07:31:24 2015 UTC,"Just be careful to not pick a show with subtitles. When I stitch I usually just pick a bad reality show and marathon through episodes of that. That way if I am concentrating so much on cross stitch I don't miss much on the show, but there is still something on in the background."
CrossStitch,3dsw4x,TanRabbits,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:52:13 2015 UTC,This is always so frustrating if there's a really good documentary I want to watch. Often pieces (or the whole film itself) will have subtitles and I just have to either stop stitching or turn it off.   Who am I kidding? I always turn it off.
CrossStitch,3dsw4x,FancyPunk,4,Tue Jul 21 02:40:41 2015 UTC,"This is going to sound so ""old lady,"" but I used to stitch all the time while watching old BBC period pieces. Mostly it was because you don't really need to see what is going on. They are like radio shows and the writing is excellent. Upstairs Downstairs got me through a lot of different projects.  Now that I have kids, my toddler's tv time has become my time to cross stitch."
CrossStitch,3dsw4x,xMLCC,2,Sun Jul 19 14:48:52 2015 UTC,I almost always watch TV or YouTube when I'm stitching. Something stupid where you don't have to give all your attention to.

So it's great to cross stitch and just listen to shows and such that I want to watch but don't necessarily need to see every little detail."
CrossStitch,3dsw4x,goosiegirl,2,Sun Jul 19 03:55:01 2015 UTC,absolutely. I won't watch my favorites but anything that doesn't need full attention is great to cross stitch to.

CrossStitch,3dsw4x,thebobomb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:10:40 2015 UTC,If Netflix is on my cross stitch is out. It's great. Just don't watch anything with subtitles or things you need to pay attention to. Sitcoms are great for example.

CrossStitch,3dsw4x,leysa,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:22:49 2015 UTC,"Yup, I almost always stitch while watching (listening) to TV.  I tend to watch a lot of trashy reality shows so I don't need to watch that closely.  :P"

My huge mistake was taking on a large project on my first start, and I never finished it because my techniques changed, my stitching changed and it was too much of a bother to fix it from the start, not to mention it was severely discouraging to start on a big project. Also Welcome to cross stitching! (:"
CrossStitch,3dqi4m,redditreaderonly,3,Sat Jul 18 14:28:01 2015 UTC,"The kids cross-stitch kits are the best learners, just graduate to bigger projects slowly. Also don't worry about doing one project at a time, I find I get bored quickly if I take on a medium to large project only...    Also find a good loop thing.. I'm still trying to find a good one."
CrossStitch,3dqi4m,KeepCalmAndNikon,2,Sat Jul 18 15:53:44 2015 UTC,"Hi there! Here is a link to the FAQ that /u/iliketoarmdance mentioned. It says this on the FAQ as well, but my advice would be to start out with a simple cross stitch kit you can find at a craft store. The first time I tried to cross stitch I bought all the materials individually, and got all the wrong stuff because I didn't know what I was doing. So I nixed that project, got a simple kit instead, and learned about the various techniques/materials that were necessary that way. It made things go a lot easier, and now I know enough to make my own patterns and stuff all the time! Good luck :D"
CrossStitch,3dqi4m,SlightFigureOfSpeech,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:25:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with everyone that you should start with a kit, but make sure it's something you want to make and not just the first thing you see, because you're more likely to finish it that way."
CrossStitch,3dr9zn,neptuneagent,2,Sat Jul 18 18:17:29 2015 UTC,"You can order supplies online if there are no stores near you. You can get items separately, or bundled together as kits (those come with everything you need to finish the project). Lots of patterns are available for instant download at etsy.com. Amazon has kits (and hoops). I would do some google searches for ""cross stitch supplies china"" to find other vendors you could order from.  Hoops aren't totally necessary but they do help keep stitches more even (especially for beginners). I would recommend it for you.  Whether or not a cross stitch would be too feminine for your friend depends on what you make and what he likes. We have lots of male cross stitchers in this subreddit, and lots of male subscribers who just appreciate the pieces being made, so your friend may very well like what you make for him. You will know what your friend likes better than we do, though. :) It is nice to frame it for him, but make sure you package it really securely so the glass doesn't get broken.        Hopefully some of that answered your questions! I would strongly recommend that you read the FAQ that is linked in the sticky post at the top of the subreddit and in the wiki section. Good luck and welcome back to cross stitch!"
CrossStitch,3dr9zn,iliketoarmdance,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:42:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you :)  I tried looking for those vendors using Chinese own search engine (baidu?) but I ended up being confused with the links that they have. My limited Chinese definitely doesn't help either :( Like I said, google is pretty much blocked here in China.  Thank you so much for your reply :)"
CrossStitch,3dr9zn,CatfishJunkie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:35:49 2015 UTC,"Hi, don't you use a VPN when in China? It will help you access Google and Facebook etc. There are free ones online or paid one's.  I find the markets are the best places though the cross stitch kits I've seen are very Chinese-y. Can't recommend an actual shop but check out markets!  Good luck!"
CrossStitch,3dr9zn,CatfishJunkie,2,Sun Jul 19 12:41:33 2015 UTC,"I have tried a couple of free ones, but they never really work for me :( and the paid ones are quite expensive, so I don't really bother with it. It is a good thing that reddit is not blocked here ;)  yes, some of the cross stitch that I have come across is very Chinese-y, and those are not the ones I am looking for, but thank you :) I will definitely look at markets, perhaps I would find the ones I like :)  Thank you :)"

CrossStitch,3dos6q,FakeNameTwo,3,Sat Jul 18 00:46:07 2015 UTC,This looks great! Although it bothers me a little that there is one less character on the last line.
CrossStitch,3dos6q,owlprowl,3,Sat Jul 18 14:00:11 2015 UTC,Should have labeled it a WIP.  I'm not finished it yet.  I've started to stitch Black Widow in that empty spot and will be able to get a few more rows in.
CrossStitch,3dos6q,owlprowl,3,Sat Jul 18 14:09:43 2015 UTC,That is a relief. ;)
CrossStitch,3dos6q,PrincessPink37,0,Sat Jul 18 14:27:06 2015 UTC,That was bothering my OCD tendencies.
CrossStitch,3dos6q,uliarliarpantsonfire,2,Sun Jul 19 02:41:46 2015 UTC,I love this! Can I ask what patterns you used?
CrossStitch,3dos6q,uliarliarpantsonfire,3,Sat Jul 18 04:53:27 2015 UTC,I'm not using one particular pattern.  These are all individual perler bead patterns created by 8-Bithero.com.  He pins them to Pinterest and I've been using them to make this blanket.  Link to patterns
CrossStitch,3dpgr7,thebobomb,4,Sat Jul 18 04:42:16 2015 UTC,I use Excel all the time when I need to chart something myself. To get all of the cells squared select all and change column width to 2 :)
CrossStitch,3dpgr7,EnviousEmma,2,Sat Jul 18 13:11:21 2015 UTC,"I've seen people on here use the paint bucket tool on Excel before and thought it was pretty genius. Love the wingdings idea for using symbols though, haven't seen that before!"
CrossStitch,3dpgr7,SlightFigureOfSpeech,2,Sat Jul 18 14:09:02 2015 UTC,I have done this for years for my personal patterns. I have several alphabets and I can just copy and paste the letters quickly when I have an idea for the text and then fill in with flowers and stuff later. It is nice to be able to have a library of smaller designs and just take and paste together a pattern when the mood strikes.
CrossStitch,3dpgr7,sylviapickles,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:20:41 2015 UTC,That's a great idea. I may have to steal that haha.
CrossStitch,3dpgr7,weezyhearts,2,Sun Jul 19 08:07:43 2015 UTC,Excel is amazing for being able to design while in work too!! :)
CrossStitch,3dpgr7,ginger14,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:31:15 2015 UTC,"This might be a bit silly, but when I'm planning out something (small) I like to build it in Minecraft using various colored wool blocks, where it's easy to flesh out the design and change things before putting it into a true pattern."
CrossStitch,3dr24e,domo_kitteh,3,Sat Jul 18 17:08:03 2015 UTC,"Wowza those are gonna be some intense projects to stitch! I would recommend that you google search ""picture to cross stitch pattern"" and try running them through a few of the sites that pop up. The patterns you get that way will usually need to be manually edited a little bit to fix some colors and random confetti stitches. There's also info on pattern making in the FAQ linked in the sticky post at the top of the subreddit and in the wiki section. It seems unlikely to me that anyone would want to make patterns for all of those without compensation because they're so detailed and likely to require a good bit of time to clean up."
CrossStitch,3dr24e,iliketoarmdance,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:51:03 2015 UTC,"I've tried a few of the programs but couldn't really get anything from them, and i figured i may as well try here. I'd be happy to pay for the patterns though."

CrossStitch,3dmpwq,hannstar89,4,Fri Jul 17 15:00:51 2015 UTC,"So.. I had NO idea what the 'parking method' was until you asked this question and I found this article here about it... I think it makes sense it you do have a lot of different colors in a variegated color scheme scene to stitch.. but I would personally worry about being able to tell which colors are which as opposed to working in sections and doing all of 1 color at a time, so I guess I can't help answer the question, but I'm curious to see what other say about it to answer you! :)"
CrossStitch,3dmpwq,sm531,4,Fri Jul 17 16:54:57 2015 UTC,Oh my god that tutorial just scared me out of doing any really complex patterns.

I have also seen pictures where people using the parking method use a clip of some type to keep threads out of the way and so they don't tangle."

CrossStitch,3dmpwq,sm531,2,Fri Jul 17 22:37:20 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is... the reason you use this method is when you have multiple colors/need for threads in a section at a time.... but when you're shading the sections, the colors are so similar!! Question is, how do you keep them all straight and not get confused which thread/color is next and all that?? :("

If I'm parking, I also have to grid my fabric, and I stitch in blocks of either 10 x 10 or 10 high x 20 wide, and I work down in columns.  So far the only patterns I've stitched in this category are Heaven and Earth Designs.  For simpler patterns, I tend to stitch cross country, one color at a time.  I've tried parking in the past but it tends to be an annoyance in that case.  Edit: here's an example of how I park - https://flic.kr/p/qsHXLC"
CrossStitch,3dmpwq,dragon-pet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:22:22 2015 UTC,Do you start in the middle or at a corner?

CrossStitch,3dk4hf,novacainedoll,6,Thu Jul 16 22:32:44 2015 UTC,"Wow that is amazing job. Do you have a picture of what it looks like in the dark, or does the camera not capture it right? I didn't even realise you could get glow in the dark thread. Is it that expensive?"
CrossStitch,3dk4hf,mayfairflower,5,Fri Jul 17 00:43:56 2015 UTC,"I could not take a decent picture of the glowing at all with my phone unfortunately, even when the thread was fully 'charged' by a lamp! Here is a good idea of its type of glow though :D   I paid £1.25 for the skein of glow in the dark DMC, which is roughly twice as much as what I pay for a normal skein of floss, so its not too expensive!  But its a nightmare to use, worse than metallics :c"
CrossStitch,3dk4hf,mayfairflower,2,Fri Jul 17 05:41:39 2015 UTC,"That comes out really well, and not as expensive as I thought it might have been.   I could imagine that it might be a horror to work with"

CrossStitch,3do2u2,Miseryhead,2,Fri Jul 17 21:10:36 2015 UTC,Unfortunately I can't recommend any programs for your question specifically but if you're interested in more Pokemon sprites this website has accurate colours and patterns!
CrossStitch,3do2u2,earthpresidentnixon,2,Fri Jul 17 21:44:35 2015 UTC,"Here is a forum that compares softwares, but read the post by dpsoftware as he talks about why it's hard to compare screenshots of different programs.  What I would suggest doing is comparing the recommended colours to the real life threads. Then you can choose which ones you actually want to use (e.g. change the colour of brown to more closely match the original photo). I often have to change the colour in patterns that are converted to ones that more closely match the original photo."
CrossStitch,3do2u2,merfione,2,Fri Jul 17 21:56:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks - fascinating thread! Like dpsoftware says, you really can't get a feel for colour accuracy until you've actually done the cross-stitch, which is why I thought I'd ask for Reddit's experiences (I'm sure that we've tried every pattern conversion program/website besides all of us on this subreddit)."
CrossStitch,3do2u2,merfione,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:12:33 2015 UTC,"I also thought it was a very interesting thread. Not necessarily what you wanted, but worth a read.   I personally don't often use conversion programs (I use hobbyware which allows you to have a picture in the background and manually create a cross stitch on top - I much prefer that method), but when I do, I normally pull out the colours it recommends (I have a large stash, so I typically have all the colours) and decide if they are similar enough for my tastes. Goes to show how much I actually trust these programs!"

If you want to try it, make sure you use a water soluble marker to mark a 10x10 grid on your fabric...don't make the mistake of using one of the ""disappearing"" fabric markers like I did at first!  Using the Goodreader app on my iPad to mark off the stitches I have done on a .pdf of the pattern is also a must!"

CrossStitch,3dk1f3,winkhun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:03:48 2015 UTC,This is the reason I haven't started it yet! I haven't decided what count I want to do it on :/ I'm also struggling with how many threads I want to use.   How did you do yours? 2 strands on 14ct? My last project I did like this I didn't like how it looked because I wanted the stitches to look more full so I'm thinking of doing this on 16ct or 18ct with 2 strands instead. It'll make it a little smaller too :P   Lol!! Idk if you've seen this already but this lovely user also did this project and said it took about a year and a half!!!
CrossStitch,3dmjet,goldirocks,2,Fri Jul 17 14:06:46 2015 UTC,"I have used PCStitch for years and love it  It's not expensive and they do everything from printing finished virtual stitches to color charts with symbols, etc.  The latest version is  PCStitch 10 and it is $49.95  You won't find a better pattern maker out there."

CrossStitch,3dkb4v,brokenelk,11,Thu Jul 16 23:26:13 2015 UTC,The few times I've given pieces as gifts I felt like they weren't really appreciated so I stopped doing it.
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,juswannalurkpls,2,Fri Jul 17 02:10:32 2015 UTC,Exactly- I stopped giving things away when I realized my knitting projects were not being used. Now I do it for the love of the art.
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,tourmaline82,7,Fri Jul 17 02:30:32 2015 UTC,"I give them either to people who ask for them (my mom), or people I know really well. I've given cross stitches to my sister and her fiance, and to my best friend; both of them are into crafting themselves and they appreciate the amount of time and effort that goes into a large project. The one I'm working on now is a picture of my aunt's horse, and she is waaaay into riding. That horse is like her baby. So even though she's not a crafty person, I figure she'll like anything that features Truman. :)"
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,teardrop87,3,Fri Jul 17 05:13:42 2015 UTC,"I gift according to the giftee's taste, and most of those are for major life events. If someone want something specific, I make them buy/assemble the kit. No one ever gets an unexpected cross stitch piece from me."
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,Stitchmond,3,Fri Jul 17 00:08:24 2015 UTC,"I only give things people want. You can't make some random cross stitch and hope someone will like it.  Whether you buy a gift for someone or make it, it has to be relevant to the giftee. That's why I'm bad at holidays and birthdays and other forced gifting occasions.  I was asked to design a pattern for a friend to stitch to give to her friend as a baby shower gift. When my friend finished it, she wasn't very enthused, and she said her friend wasn't overly fond of it. I'm definitely not going to give her anything again.  Surprisingly, some people are really into stitches I've done that I would never have considered giving them."
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,kammycool,2,Fri Jul 17 03:24:27 2015 UTC,Everyone I've given a project to has it displayed in their homes and said that they love them. I don't mind giving them away. What am I going to do with a ton of finished projects for myself?
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,AppleTeaCake,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:41:42 2015 UTC,I'm going to learn quilting and sew them altogether and either make a bed quilt or a wall hanging.....though I've been saying that for about ten years now and the finished and almost-finished cross stitches are still sitting in a box in the cupboard! I've given several away as a present but I'm hanging onto my faves.
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,chanceldony,2,Fri Jul 17 21:21:04 2015 UTC,"I actually have more trouble with my knitting than my stitches.  Too many commercially available things that look the same/better.  Anything that looks too plain/generic probably won't be appreciated, especially not as much as you know time went into it.  I only gift small stitches because of this."
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,sm531,2,Fri Jul 17 14:18:24 2015 UTC,"I have yet to delve too far into the world of gifting cross stitches.. so far it's been either just general pieces I make bc they're cute, or pieces I've been asked to make and they seem to like them.. Only 1 item has been a gift for a friend that got married, and she AND her hubby loved it.. I'm afraid for the day I finish something for someone and they end up not liking it! :("
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,Witchymommy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"I've only ever given them to people I know would appreciate them. Plus for me I enjoy making them but generally have no desire to keep them; certainly not the quantity I've made over the years, so I basically need to give them away.   The key seems to be to make something exactly to that persons taste. I've still got one or two projects nearly finished that I started with no one in mind, and I have no idea who to give them too so they just sit there until I can figure it out.   It would be very disappointing to put that much time and effort into something and have it be unappreciated. And yes, most people would probably like cash or something more practical as a wedding gift. The birth announcement cross-stitches do seem to be generally more appreciated, though that still depends on the personality of the person you are giving it to."
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,Witchymommy,4,Fri Jul 17 15:57:32 2015 UTC,"I already have this theory that we tend to give gifts of guilt. That it puts a burden on the receiver to keep things they don't like/want because it was given to them by someone they do like. So there is constantly this inner turmoil of I can't throw it away.... But I don't particularly care for it...... And crafting gifts are HUGe gifts of guilt. I personally love what I do and spend loads of time doing it- but I really don't want someone else to give me something like this- because it is so taste specific- even if we think we know someone's taste we probably don't because taste is a fickle thing. And the craft we do is so visible and such a reflection on the owners sense of style for them to display. I look at this like a puzzle- it is something I do for me. I think gifting such items at times can be selfish because we get the joy out of creating, the joy of recognition by those who know we gifted it, and then give the burden to the recipient. This is just my two cents and if people don't agree I am down with a good discussion:)"
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,chicken_arise_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:31:43 2015 UTC,"I guess it also comes down to the personality of the giver. The people I would consider giving things to are ones who know me well enough to know that I'm pretty much impossible to offend. If it isn't to their taste and they didn't like it, I would be more likely to find it funny than be offended. In general I check to see they actually want it before making it or they show an interest in something so specific I know they will want it.   I can see your point. I can see why some people would feel the obligation to hold on to something they didn't like out of guilt. I certainly have felt that before to some degree, but that tends to be solely related to family instead of being an issue with friends."
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,chicken_arise_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:59:38 2015 UTC,"I worked on one gift for over a year; it was the first big pattern I made myself, and I put a lot of thought into it.   The recipient posted it on Facebook saying ""this definitely makes the list of top ten coolest gifts ever."" I know it's dumb but that was the hugest insult to me. I think I'm only putting a lot of work into projects for myself from here on out..."
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,sm531,8,Fri Jul 17 02:30:36 2015 UTC,Why were you insulted? Too ten coolest gifts ever is an honor:)
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,chicken_arise_,2,Fri Jul 17 02:51:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know it was probably meant to be nice. The person I gave it to was my bf's sister and we have had a tumultuous relationship. I always try to give thoughtful (and nice) gifts and I was trying to leave a good impression. I feel like my stitch was ultimately just compared to a keurig.   You're probably right though, I shouldn't be so cynical. But yes, I can totally relate to gifted stitches not being appreciated!"
CrossStitch,3dkb4v,sm531,2,Fri Jul 17 03:04:20 2015 UTC,"I can understand that actually... I think it'd be better if they were able to categorize like ""The best personalized gift ever!!"" or perhaps even leave it more general, not even number it but leave it at ""Such an awesome gift to get, I love it!"" or ""It's wonderful!""...something like that. I put the situation the same as ""you're like, one of the best boyfriends I've ever had!!"" ... that's probably going to hurt his feelings 99% of the time, same thing for something like gifts and such...It's the same mentality with complimenting anyone on just about anything.. don't just say ""You're so nice!"" but really say something like ""You're always so nice when I ask you questions, never seem annoyed (even if you are) and I really appreciate that about you"""

CrossStitch,3dkjiq,pacsunmama,2,Fri Jul 17 06:49:24 2015 UTC,I like to start at one corner of the pattern. But you have to make sure to leave enough room for whatever edge so you have a border. I usually measure it out with a ruler.

CrossStitch,3dkjiq,PurpleMonkey182,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:26:32 2015 UTC,I use a calculator app on my phone. You enter how many stitches high and wide and if you want a border around it. It will tell you how big it'll be total. Then I measure in and up from a corner and start there.

CrossStitch,3dkjiq,thePyper,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:46:35 2015 UTC,"If I am tackling a larger project I find the centre of the fabric and count out each stitch (and triple check) with pins to the edges to make sure it fits on the fabric. Then I use some spare thread (typically not a colour in the design) to tack out the border of the design. This makes sure the pattern will fit, and also tells me if the squares are actually square or rectangular. Don't trust measuring with a ruler - often an 18 ct fabric will be 17ct in one direction and 19ct in the other.  After that start whereever you want!"
CrossStitch,3dkjiq,Fraerie,2,Sat Jul 18 08:30:53 2015 UTC,"If the provided aida is too close in size to the planned pattern I would also add some kind of waste fabric border before I started stitching, it will make it easier to hold it in a ring or frame and will protect the edges from fraying."

CrossStitch,3ddx3o,Googalyfrog,2,Wed Jul 15 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"OH! I know how to fix that problem!  Thread your needle like normal. Fray the end of the thread and tie a knot in it. Then open up the frayed part (split the threads so there's a hole in between them) and slide your needle into it.   That way, your end isn't dangling free and is connected to your needle. You get less knots and it won't unravel on you."
CrossStitch,3ddx3o,GandalfTheGrey1991,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:11:41 2015 UTC,I'm new to this so can I ask in which instances you would want to use satin threads?
CrossStitch,3ddx3o,meowzickers,2,Thu Jul 16 13:19:13 2015 UTC,It really depends on you and the pattern.  Satin like metallic threads will let you have bits of your piece to stand out or have a different texture. Often satin and metallic thread are used when back stitching.     Some times i like to use silvery satin threads on bits in what ever i'm stitching that are supposed to be metal and 'metallic' threads are sometimes a bit glittery.   One time i just had a pattern to which i wanted a particular color for the border and a satin one was closest and made the border more interesting.
CrossStitch,3ddx3o,Googalyfrog,2,Thu Jul 16 14:08:19 2015 UTC,Got it. So I'm gathering from this that different thread materials add depth and (obviously) texture. I'm going to have to test some out! Thanks for your help.

CrossStitch,3dgger,rummy26,6,Thu Jul 16 02:03:13 2015 UTC,"I've never gridded anything I've stitched. I don't think most people do, unless they're working on something really big. Most likely you will get used to counting the stitches in your head, but obviously do whatever you need to do to make this enjoyable for yourself.   The ""outline"" stuff is called backstitching, and it needs to be saved til the end...because, as you've found, the surrounding cross stitches will hide it. Sorry you're learning that the hard way!  Also I am concerned that you might be using ""one thread"" with all six strands of floss. Just in case you are, this picture illustrates how six strands of floss come twisted together into one larger thread. Two or three of the smaller strands are generally what is used. You have to separate them from the twisted bunch manually. The first 40ish seconds of this video illustrates the easiest way I know of to do this (stop watching the video after that bit and come back to it after you've mastered the basics).  Hopefully this has been some help. I'd also really recommend checking out the FAQ linked in the sticky post at the top of the subreddit. There's some excellent information in there, including a very detailed tutorial. :)"

Yup - it was backstitching, the good news is I'm not emotionally vested in this project because I think it's time to just scrap it.  Thanks again for your help.

CrossStitch,3dgger,thebobomb,3,Thu Jul 16 12:18:10 2015 UTC,"I bought a water soluble marker for $5 and it's the bomb diggity. I personally draw on the outline (not the back stitching, but the shape of the area I'm stitching) and it makes it way easier. Then when I'm done, I just dab at it with a damp cloth and it magically disappears. They also have ones that disappear after a few hours on its own.  You could also try marking off all the spots of one colour first of its a smaller project. You can use pencil too, but that can show through your thread and is hard to wash out."

They want you to separate it out into usually 2 strands for the main stitches and then usually 1 for backstitching. So each length usually goes a pretty long way.   If you were already clear on that, please disregard. :-)"
CrossStitch,3dgger,Witchymommy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:56 2015 UTC,OH! I didn't realize backstitching usually uses 1! So when I ran short using two I figured all the stitching should have been with 1. It looks like a hot mess. This really helps!!
CrossStitch,3dgger,DamnImLost,2,Thu Jul 16 18:17:34 2015 UTC,"Glad it helps. We all make strange mistakes in the beginning, and even after we've been doing for a while. Usually I'm okay with it as long as I can figure out what I did wrong. If I can't figure it out it drives me nuts.   As long as you are learning and enjoying it, that is really all that matters. Your next one will turn out great!"
CrossStitch,3dgger,layerkate,2,Thu Jul 16 21:23:40 2015 UTC,"Whether I grid or not depends on the projects. For small, simple ones I usually don't bother, because gridding takes some time. Other projects I grid with a water soluble marker or sewing chalk. It just helps to spot mistakes faster. Although I often don't make the whole grid at once, only the area I will be stitching on at the time and then expand it later if necessary. Sometimes the pattern is easy enough to follow once it is stared, so I don't expand the grid then.  Do you mean backstitching with outline? This is done after stitching the area surrounding it, so that it doesn't get eaten by the normal stitching."
CrossStitch,3dgger,bubbledoo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:13:04 2015 UTC,Turns out I did mean backstitching and yes.... it got eaten!
CrossStitch,3dgger,Plants4Life,2,Thu Jul 16 12:20:51 2015 UTC,Most times kits will have the floss color in DMC or Anchor that it uses. If you wanted to do 2 strands maybe you could go buy floss in the right color you need? It would add cost but might help with it being more enjoyable.
CrossStitch,3dgger,iliketoarmdance,2,Thu Jul 16 14:10:14 2015 UTC,"I only grid projects that are big or complicated. I inherited a few skeins of metallic thread that I never use, so now I use it for gridding. It's flexible enough to stitch around and cut/pull out when I'm finished. Except I'm lazy so I only grid horizontally, not vertically, and view the blank spaces as another box.   Similar to this: http://www.dragonlore.net/blackwork/grdbstg/linen_grid.gif"
CrossStitch,3dgger,kthelastfan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:28:14 2015 UTC,I started recently too. I use a pencil to mark where to stitch. I mark the center and count from there to find the edges of the project. If/when I mess up I can erase the pencil marks.

You could hand sew it, just need to make sure that your stitches are close together to keep it strong and stop any stuffing fall out, also need to try and keep them as straight as possible."
CrossStitch,3desce,hannstar89,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:26:18 2015 UTC,"The one and only pillow ornament thing I ever made (10 years ago...) I sewed completely by hand. As long as you go in a straight line it doesn't really matter when the pillow's turned right-side-out to be stuffed and finished with the hangy thing. Those stitches end up on the inside so it's not like you can see 'em. SO, I don't think you NEED a sewing machine. But if you want one anyway, because they're handy to have...I hope someone else can chime in! The one I have was a hand-me-down gift from my grandma and I wouldn't even know where to start with recommendations. I'd venture that for simple little things like this you probably don't need to (and shouldn't) splurge on something with lots of bells and whistles. And I'd also suggest asking for machine suggestions in /r/sewing (though I bet they have info in the sidebar or wiki so you might not even need to post).  Good luck :)  Edit! /r/sewing has an incredible sidebar, and the very first link in it is a sewing machine buying guide."

CrossStitch,3dcwre,alex_of_doom,2,Wed Jul 15 07:49:33 2015 UTC,It sounds like you might want to use another strand of floss for more coverage. Check out this page to see how many strands of floss you want to use: http://www.better-cross-stitch-patterns.com/floss-coverage.html  Another option is Railroading. It helps the floss to lay flat but takes more time: http://cross-stitch.livejournal.com/788263.html

Good reader on IPad is a bit better, it lets you mark off square by square wheras the one I use it's like using a highlighter pen, so it's free hand.

CrossStitch,3d8z9i,sm531,2,Tue Jul 14 19:53:52 2015 UTC,"I think the idea definitely has merit!! The one big thing about digital patterns for me is I can't mark off physically where I'm at in the pattern, so having paper is necessary to do that, but the idea of being able to highlight the areas where you are I think is a great feature!! I agree though that the whole copyright of images thing could get tricky, that and/or people sharing patterns they've purchased, say, from an Etsy seller, then sharing as their own or just in general for free, so I think that might be an issue, not sure how to fix/block, whatever that part...I do also like the idea of being able to grid out designs yourself by just drawing. I think it would be helpful to be able to choose what thread brand you'd be using, and then just have those colors available when you color in, that way you're not trying to match the colors later at the store on hue alone?"

CrossStitch,3d7ljb,mochigashi,3,Tue Jul 14 03:31:24 2015 UTC,Hello everyone! It's been awhile since I posted any progress on my Sumer Mario World project. I am using appx. 18 count with DHC colors. I found the pattern on Sprite Stitch. I started this project around the end of February 2014. Do enjoy!

CrossStitch,3d9e77,princess2293,3,Tue Jul 14 15:05:23 2015 UTC,"It's very difficult without a hoop or some sort of frame to hold the fabric a little taught as you have to muss with all the loose fabric while trying to get your needle where it needs to be on both sides. Being in a frame also helps with the stitches all being the same size/tightness (not too loose, not too tight)."
CrossStitch,3d9e77,sm531,2,Tue Jul 14 16:04:57 2015 UTC,"I don't use a hoop, and have been stitching with linen (which can be a little stretchier and more poorly behaved than Aida, I find) for several years. I find the hoops stretch the fabric in strange ways around the edges, and they tend to crush stitches in an unflattering way on the larger pieces.   It does take a little more practice to get the tension in your floss right, but I wouldn't call it difficult. Usually I just gently roll up the right hand side close to where I'm working, to get a better grip, and then go from there. If you want to see an example of a piece stitched without a hoop, check out my submissions - my Letters from Nora fairy has been done in this way."
CrossStitch,3d9e77,Pheleon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:15:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this response.  I'm working on my first cross stitch that I've done since I was a kid.  And when I was a kid I just did stamped pieces and they were small enough that they all fit in the hoop by itself.  I was worried about crushing stitches on the project that I am working on now, as I got (probably overly) ambitious and purchased a HUGE kit to do."
CrossStitch,3d9e77,Pheleon,2,Tue Jul 14 16:22:53 2015 UTC,"If you really like using the hoop, I might suggest looking into getting a Q-snap or a scroll frame for your larger pieces. I've never used one myself, but you can get multiple sizes for the Q-snaps, and I think some of them are even adjustable.   Otherwise, if you want to try it without the hoop and you're having trouble managing the fabric with the hand you hold it in (which for me is the left), you could consider rolling it and then using an extra tapestry needle or a quilting pin or two to keep it in place.   You will also need to iron around your fabric every now and then; holding it in your hands will cause some rumples. Just use an ironing cloth (not directly on your linen/Aida), and go around the edges. Don't iron directly on your stitch work. And keep your hands washed! I don't have AC in my house, so in the summer I get up every hour or so and give my hands a scrub."
CrossStitch,3d9e77,Pheleon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:38:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your detailed responses, they are really helpful so far.    And this is going to sound like a stupid question - how to you iron it without ironing over the stitches?"
CrossStitch,3d9e77,trahnse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"You just iron the fabric without stitching on it. I usually iron about 1-2 inches around the entire design. It's just to keep the fabric tidy when you're working with it. Don't touch the stitches with the iron. They won't melt or anything, but you will flatten them a lot, which I find doesn't look very nice.   Ironing isn't a ""must do"" sort of thing; I like doing it every now and then because I'm a bit of a neat freak and like my fabric to look nice. It also makes your work look a lot better in pictures, if you're inclined to show it off here a little! =)"
CrossStitch,3d9e77,teardrop87,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense.  Thank you.... obviously, there is so much that I don't know about stitching. I am working on this right now.  It has been really slow going, but once I get a little further into it, I might post some WIP pictures (if I have enough guts... all of you on here are so good!).  Technically this one is needlepoint, however."
CrossStitch,3d9e77,sarynkitamo,2,Tue Jul 14 18:42:51 2015 UTC,"I use hoops. I've tried Q-snap type frames and I didn't like them; however, seems I'm in the minority here ;)  If you do use hoops, don't worry about crushing your stitches or hoop marks. When you aren't stitching, take the hoop off and this will reduce the hoop marks that you will have to iron out. Yes, the hoop can flatten stitches, but when you wash and iron it, they will fluff up back to normal."
CrossStitch,3d9e77,turtree,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:08:46 2015 UTC,It depends on the size of my pieces. Bookmarks are done without one. Medium sized pieces are done in either a hoop or my q-snap. Large and extra large projects are done on my floor stand scroll frame.
CrossStitch,3d9e77,DamnImLost,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:20:00 2015 UTC,I use hoops but lately I've mostly been using q-snap frames.

CrossStitch,3d4yle,Nursekate15,3,Mon Jul 13 15:46:49 2015 UTC,"Mind if I ask a question/give some advice? It looks as though you might be switching stitch directions on alternating rows: for example, on one row, you go across with the / / / stitches then go back with the \ \ \  ones, then switch on the next row so that the left-to-right stitches end up on top instead. If you want a more consistent look over the whole piece, you might want to try making sure you have the stitches go in the same direction every time.  However, if you did indeed alternate stitch directions, it kind of gives a cool effect to the whole piece, almost like you used variegated floss! And also, way to go on picking such a big piece for your first project. My first one was like a 3"" x 3"" kit for little kids, haha. It looks great; can't wait to see all your future works!"

CrossStitch,3d26ok,GandalfTheGrey1991,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:46:29 2015 UTC,"So, what's stamped fabric? Is it different to regular fabric?"
CrossStitch,3d26ok,NiceTryFry,2,Tue Jul 14 01:55:49 2015 UTC,I believe it's just regular fabric but the x's are marked. That way you don't have a bunch of different sized x's.
CrossStitch,3d26ok,BeanyFrog,2,Tue Jul 14 10:46:38 2015 UTC,This was also my first kit and my first cross stitch ever! It's currently sitting on my bookshelf.

CrossStitch,3d5axz,sm531,5,Mon Jul 13 17:16:34 2015 UTC,"For something like that, I would definitely do 10x10 stitch grids, which are going to be a lot harder to do on black fabric (for me, at least. I use a water-soluble pen and it wouldn't show up on the black...) but it'll help you work bit by bit/page by page."
CrossStitch,3d5axz,sarynkitamo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:05:01 2015 UTC,"I have seen methods of using fishing line, weaved under and on top of 10/ct sections alternating..., I just don't know how well that might show up on the black fabric or not.. if not, maybe just regular thread could work? Either way, if that doesn't work, I agree that a water soluble or chalk pencil or something could work..."
CrossStitch,3d5axz,SayceGards,2,Mon Jul 13 21:28:12 2015 UTC,Why not use a piece of white thread?
CrossStitch,3d5axz,DamnImLost,2,Tue Jul 14 02:57:12 2015 UTC,"I've had a white water-soluble pen for a project on dark blue aida and it worked great, but it did not last long unfortunately. I switched to tailor's chalk (or French chalk). Normally those come in triangles, but I found a pen that works with that. Since it is chalk you can wash it out. The pen I got came with different colours. I used it on my project and had no problems.   When I use thread to do the grid, I ofen end up having problems pulling it all out."
CrossStitch,3d5axz,DamnImLost,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:20:39 2015 UTC,Something like this perhaps?
CrossStitch,3d5axz,DamnImLost,2,Tue Jul 14 13:23:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, something like that. It's easier to handle than the triangles in my opinion.  edit: And since it is chalk it does not dry out or go bad if you don't use it for some time. Where I live, the water soluble pens are really expensive and I had one dry out before. I was really happy when I found the chalk pens."
CrossStitch,3d5axz,SayceGards,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:02:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have one of those pens, but read that it only stays for so long,... since this piece will be taking me about 5 MONTHS (my goal is to have it done, framed and mailed from TX to AL by this Xmas), I don't want to use it at all since I'll need the lines to stick around longer"
CrossStitch,3d5axz,PrincessPink37,2,Tue Jul 14 14:38:57 2015 UTC,"What I did for the big piece I'm working at the moment on, was not doing the grid all at once. First I determined the middle point of the fabric and then just made part of the grid. I wanted to start in the upper left corner of the pattern, so I counted from the middle up and then left. Those areas of the grid I marked with sewing floss. Once I knew where I'd start I did the grid with the white pen, but only for the page I would be working on. The pen lasted only 2 pages, so I now use the chalk. By doing the grid page for page it does not really matter if the chalk stays long enough or not. I did not have problems with it vanishing before I was finished. And I still have the middle lines marked with the floss.   I also heard that some people had problems washing the white marker out after too long a time."
CrossStitch,3d5axz,iliketoarmdance,3,Tue Jul 14 14:48:54 2015 UTC,"I usually just start in the middle and move outward in a way that I won't fuck up the counting and do the whole damn thing wrong. Like, I'll start at the middle and go up in one color. Then when I get to the top I'll go left and right in the same or a different color. And then I'll go from there with colors that are in proximity to the already stitched things.  Also it'll be very obvious if you don't stitch the black. I definitely think you should stitch it."
CrossStitch,3d5axz,chanceldony,3,Tue Jul 14 02:56:12 2015 UTC,I second that last statement. Stitch the black.
CrossStitch,3d2q5e,Beeswax-NotYoursInc,2,Mon Jul 13 01:29:43 2015 UTC,Cute! Some back stitching might help the tail and face stand out on the white background as well :)

I'll open it up on my laptop later and have a proper look but that looks great :) I was a bit worried about the border type detail not working out. Do you think it would work on a smaller aida count, like16/18 say if I used the bigger pattern size? I'm not too fussed as I just fancy doing the pattern whatever but was thinking about it being a bit smaller but don't want to lose detail. And it looks like you know what you are doing.

CrossStitch,3d0bbk,t0xie,2,Sun Jul 12 21:38:42 2015 UTC,"I'll try to get some pictures up. I usually start either in the bottom left corner and work up and out  from there. Or, I start in the center, work towards the bottom left corner, and then work up and out from there.  I try to do all the stitches of one color in an area before moving on to another color, but sometimes I get bored or frustrated and switch it up.  The only time my partially-finished item has a square block is if I'm doing a geometric pattern that naturally transitions to a different color that way."

CrossStitch,3cwec2,Witchymommy,2,Sun Jul 12 16:18:45 2015 UTC,Oooh man that is coming along nicely. I'm spending my vacation the same  way. How are you dealing with the agonizing pain of being hunched over for hours?
CrossStitch,3cwec2,UghCharlie,5,Sat Jul 11 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"Thank you :) ah well being very long-limbed and prone to aches, I have come up with a new way of not getting back ache. Basically sit on the sofa, rest your back against the arm of the sofa, stretch your legs out and bend them to rest your work on your knees and bingo, hours of cramp free fun :')"
CrossStitch,3cxwho,vampite,3,Sat Jul 11 19:39:54 2015 UTC,"I use the biggest one I can for the piece; otherwise I find I'm moving it around way too much.  Lately I have come to prefer scroll frames to hoops.  (The kind with the split dowel, not the kind where you have to sew your piece onto it!)  They can be a pain to set up but I like that I don't have to move them around and they don't leave creases in the fabric."
CrossStitch,3cxwho,Exiled_In_LA,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's about what is comfortable for you, as long as the fabric fits into the hoop. I am busy working on a rectangular piece and I switch between 3 hoop sizes depending on which area I am working on. I go smaller when working on a corner."
CrossStitch,3cxwho,Prazzie,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:38:21 2015 UTC,"I use the smallest size frame I can get away with for the project. If it fits in a 4"" hoop, that's what I use. If it fits in 6"", there you go. The largest hoop that is comfortable for me to use is either 8 or 10"", so that's what I use for larger projects (or I use a Q-snap frame, which you almost certainly do NOT need to worry about yet as a newbie). And then I just move the hoop around as necessary.    But at the end of the day, there's no real science to it and everybody's preference is going to vary at least a little. So just do what feels comfortable and find what works for you. :)"
CrossStitch,3cxwho,iliketoarmdance,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:44:10 2015 UTC,"I just used a 7"" because it was the only one I had lol! I don't think specific size really matters, but too big and it may be difficult to be maneuvering your hands around it when working on a smaller crease and too small and you'll be removing and repositioning the hoop a lot and causing more creases to iron."
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,licacanadiana,6,Sat Jul 11 00:41:37 2015 UTC,What's the advantage of winding threads like that?
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,drewadrawing,6,Sat Jul 11 01:00:08 2015 UTC,"Personally, its not only WAY quicker but I have terrible wrists and it's soo much easier on them."
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,drewadrawing,6,Sat Jul 11 01:05:11 2015 UTC,Oh no! I mean in general. Why wind them onto a thing instead of just using them in the form they come in?
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,tourmaline82,12,Sat Jul 11 01:11:34 2015 UTC,"Oohh for me its to keep them organized. They fit into the thread boxes from Michael's perfectly and I can keep them in numerical order.  There are a lot of people who do it differently, I just started with this method, so I've kind of just stuck with it."
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,sassystitch,4,Sat Jul 11 01:17:21 2015 UTC,"This, plus I like to pre-cut them into manageable lengths, a little less than my armspan. Probably comes from starting on kits where the floss comes in 36"" lengths. I'm also paranoid about my floss tangling, I hate hate hate tangled floss. Having it loose makes me uncomfortable, the first thing I do upon buying floss is cut and wind it all neat and tidy on a bobbin."
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,sm531,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:40:26 2015 UTC,"Oooh, I never thought about precutting them. Sounds like a TON of work but so worth it when stitching!    Edit: Premium cutting!"
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,hetero_FLEXIBLE,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:25:39 2015 UTC,"I put my floss on the bobbins so that they're easier to transport, easier to organize, they keep the thread untangled but also, when you get to a certain amount left on a skein (just like a skein of regular yarn), the paper labels will fall off and then you will lose track of what color/number they are. Also, with the little bobbins, I've found a little zippered pill container on clearance one day that about 10 or so can fit in!! In fact, I have the little blue one on the front left of this display!! I can easily take my thread, little scissors, needles, everything but the fabric/hoop so it's really convenient for the bobbins."
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,Plants4Life,7,Sun Jul 12 23:18:00 2015 UTC,Where'd you get the drill attachment?
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,iliketoarmdance,5,Sat Jul 11 03:01:21 2015 UTC,"Can't you just tighten the drill onto the bobin? Like, use it in place of a bit?"
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,ScribeVallincourt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:23:06 2015 UTC,"Yes. I do this. I usually stick a penny or dime in the side with only one pincher thing, so it doesn't dent the bobbin. It works beautifully and requires no additional set up. Fast and easy.    Edit- though it might depend on the type of drill you have...I don't know enough about 'em to know if they'd all work that way."
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,businessowl,2,Sat Jul 11 13:51:01 2015 UTC,I also am curious about this.
CrossStitch,3cv2tb,PrincessPink37,2,Sat Jul 11 07:41:51 2015 UTC,So it looks like they make a hand crank bobbin winder that you can just take apart and put into your drill chuck.

CrossStitch,3csdhs,lizmixter,5,Fri Jul 10 11:32:47 2015 UTC,Hey stupid question alert... And what you've done is gorgeous so I apologise for how this is going to sound without expressing it vocally... What is the 'point' of samplers? I get that in the past they may have been good ways of distributing patterns and shapes to people... Or am I completely off with that idea? I worked in a craft shop when I was 13 and i have always wondered.
CrossStitch,3csdhs,PhoenixGrey,5,Fri Jul 10 19:56:55 2015 UTC,http://www.victorian-embroidery-and-crafts.com/sampler.html  This might help.   TL:DR samplers were created as a way for young women to learn  sewing skills and then to show off their skills with more complex patterns. They used to be extraordinarily elaborate with much more complex stitches than what I've done.

CrossStitch,3cnkk4,ellisinahat,2,Thu Jul 9 08:07:55 2015 UTC,"Normally you'd wash after the backstitching. I've never worked with metallic floss, though, but it should be fine. The FAQ has a section about metallic floss, have you looked if you find something there?   If you really need to wash your peace, then wash it now, although I would wash it again after the backstitching, because it is easier to get all the wrinkles out this way.   You also could take a piece of the gold floss and make it wet, see what happens. Maybe stitch it on a small bit of fabric."

CrossStitch,3ciuta,bluestocking06,2,Wed Jul 8 14:27:05 2015 UTC,The original pattern doesn't have one so I doubt it. However you're right that a lot of fonts like this put a wider base so it would usually be an extra stitch at the bottom.
CrossStitch,3ciuta,bluestocking06,2,Wed Jul 8 15:38:04 2015 UTC,Serif fonts always have those little lines on both sides. It looks a little incomplete without it on the right because the T and K both have them on either side. Although the M doesn't have it either. Odd.
CrossStitch,3ciuta,bluestocking06,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:42:01 2015 UTC,The M doesn't have it on the font I used. It does seem odd to me too. But I'll fix it. :)

CrossStitch,3cj19e,thebobomb,8,Wed Jul 8 08:05:45 2015 UTC,This is how I feel about Reddit Gifts. I've probably given almost all my matches a small cross-stitched gift. Haha!
CrossStitch,3cj19e,redditreaderonly,2,Wed Jul 8 08:47:56 2015 UTC,"I knit as well as cross stitch, and I find that knitting people gifts is almost always easier. People who don't do either never seem to understand just how much time goes into these projects, and so rather than spending 8+ hours on a cross stitch, I'd rather whip out a 1-2 hour knitting project that they'll probably use more often.  Not to say don't gift cross stitches, I've done so in the past and people love them, but just be sure to take into account your own sanity and time vs their appreciation. My two cents at least."

CrossStitch,3cj19e,Pravadeus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:33:14 2015 UTC,Unfortunately my knitting skills are contained to squares and rectangles haha. I also can't knit for longer than 5-10 minutes at a time without lightning shocks in my wrist. (Yay carpal tunnel) By some miracle cross stitch doesn't make my wrist as agro so I'm limited in my options. I have definitely thought about the effort though. Luckily I have a very small gifting pool and most of it is family who loves that stuff. My friends and I just don't get each other stuff because we don't need it or have the money haha.
CrossStitch,3cj19e,Pravadeus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:31:46 2015 UTC,"Oh no that sucks, and can definitely be an obstacle to getting started. If you were knitting and holding the yarn with your right hand, which is often called throwing stitches, look into doing it with your left, sometimes called continental style. It's widely considered better for arthritic knitters, and is actually a lot faster than throwing stitches too."

A few months ago they had some Satsuma Street patterns. My mothers day gift for my mom was from that magazine as well.   They ship physical magazines or you can get the digital version on both Google Play and The App Store.
CrossStitch,3chn13,xKateSpade,2,Wed Jul 8 06:03:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with this.  Cross Stitcher is the one that I like most consistently.  I find something in most issues that I want to do, and the do have a lot of nice Christmas patterns during the fall/winter if you enjoy and can use them.  They also have good finishing ideas and clear instructions on how to do it."
CrossStitch,3chn13,SchmoosMom,2,Wed Jul 8 11:15:27 2015 UTC,I second this as well. By far my favorite and has the most modern patterns.
CrossStitch,3chn13,bluestocking06,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:29:05 2015 UTC,"http://www.cross-stitching.com/magazines/the-world-of-cross-stitching  This one is a mixed bag, and probably one you've heard of before. I tend to find something in every magazine I get, but I usually get them based on what I can see on the webpage or in the store, and the 'gift' is usually awesome.   It's a mix of modern, childish, and old fashion. I don't think it's worth getting every issue, mostly because it is expensive and I don't love all the issues that much."
CrossStitch,3chn13,owlprowl,0,Wed Jul 8 01:09:50 2015 UTC,"I love crosssticher (most modern), sometimes cross stitch crazy and world of cross stitching have really great patterns too. I use their newsstand apps on iPad. I'll subscribe if there is a good sale. They often have single issues on sale for 99 cents. It is great because there is no clutter, no magazines to store. When I want to do one of the projects I just print out the relevant pages."
CrossStitch,3cexky,jenniferwhateves,4,Tue Jul 7 11:26:13 2015 UTC,"This is really cute!! I have one comment though: I'm not sure if you did this on purpose or not, but the top part of your stitches are alternating directions. i.e. it's going like this: ////. Normally all the stitches are sewed such that that the top stitches all go in the same direction like this ///// (photo reference) (I hope this makes sense)."
CrossStitch,3cexky,bubzies,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:27:49 2015 UTC,I totally know what you mean. It wasn't on purpose unfortunately. Hah I still need some practice for sure.
CrossStitch,3cexky,bubzies,2,Tue Jul 7 23:39:16 2015 UTC,At least it is alternating so it looks pretty cool! :)
CrossStitch,3cexky,ohbahkaybe,2,Wed Jul 8 12:24:19 2015 UTC,"Is that a french knot at the top??  If so, it looks absolutely perfect! Lol, I have such a hard time with them. :)"
CrossStitch,3cexky,layerkate,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:54:12 2015 UTC,I bought one of those kits for my friend who has never cross stitched before! She loved it! Your robot is super cute :) Welcome to cross stitching
CrossStitch,3cbtf1,kaywooo,5,Mon Jul 6 18:14:27 2015 UTC,Nice work!  Is it a trick of the light or is the finished area padded?
CrossStitch,3cbtf1,COPYstamp,4,Mon Jul 6 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks! There is no padding, but I pushed the back of the hoop up to create the effect. I also use Heat'n Bond to iron on fabric to the back to make it more stiff and to ensure no threads come undone."
CrossStitch,3cbtf1,COPYstamp,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:02:25 2015 UTC,Neat! It looks really nice.
CrossStitch,3cbtf1,siderealis,3,Tue Jul 7 00:23:38 2015 UTC,This is so awesome - well done! Where did you get the pattern?
CrossStitch,3cbtf1,bluebuckeye,2,Mon Jul 6 20:52:05 2015 UTC,It looks like it may be a mash up of two of Plastic Little Covers' patterns.
CrossStitch,3cbtf1,siderealis,2,Mon Jul 6 22:37:02 2015 UTC,Thanks so much!  /u/bluebuckeye is correct -- I used two patterns to make this. Both can be purchased at the following links: https://www.etsy.com/listing/126329385/girls-just-wanna-have-fundamental-human?ref=shop_home_active_20 https://www.etsy.com/listing/184609846/im-an-adult-modern-floral-cross-stitch?ref=shop_home_active_17 I did have to alter the second pattern slightly to fit with my text/hoop.
CrossStitch,3cbtf1,Marimba_Ani,2,Tue Jul 7 00:13:38 2015 UTC,You did such a great job! Thank you for sharing!!
CrossStitch,3cbtf1,Marimba_Ani,3,Tue Jul 7 01:28:48 2015 UTC,"This is completely awesome.  I would also like a link to the pattern.  If it's something you came up with, please offer it for sale so I can buy it.  KTHXBYE!  EDIT:  Never mind.  It's this (pattern only here), which I can buy, with some different flowers, which I can do.  :)"

CrossStitch,3cdi1d,Sir_Speshkitty,2,Tue Jul 7 06:21:24 2015 UTC,I'm curious as to how the back of that looks.
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,spicycashew,3,Tue Jul 7 12:47:04 2015 UTC,I can help you out with that curiosity: http://imgur.com/ik7vEnX
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,leysa,2,Tue Jul 7 13:08:07 2015 UTC,"Awww yeaaaaaaah. Looks so good! I haven't done this in +10 years, and I just started working on a recreation of an old Zelda poster from Nintendo Power. The back of my piece certainly shows the 'evolution' of my stitching, lol. I can't wait to see this finished, I've been considering this project for a while."
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,spicycashew,2,Tue Jul 7 23:32:25 2015 UTC,"Holy crow, do you have a pattern for the poster?  I speedrun Zelda and I LOVE that."
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,Sir_Speshkitty,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:40:04 2015 UTC,"I actually had to make one! It isn't a true pattern... I've just opened up the poster in Photoshop and drew some lines on it to get an idea of pixel-count/triforce size. Once I wrangle one together, I'll share!"
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,Theeyesofmadness85,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks!"
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,Theeyesofmadness85,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:16:08 2015 UTC,That looks so neat!!! I wish I could figure out how to keep mine neat
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,plethomacademia,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:50:20 2015 UTC,It's a lot easier to keep it neat when there's such large blocks of one color. Much less jumping!
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,plethomacademia,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:52:21 2015 UTC,Makes sense. Looks really good. Where did you get the pattern?
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,plethomacademia,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:10:23 2015 UTC,I bought this one: https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/81149685/hyrule-light-world-map-cross-stitch  I know there's a free one some where as well but I follow someone else's blog who is working on this pattern so I decided to get one I knew was good.
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,supbanana,2,Tue Jul 7 21:10:59 2015 UTC,"Ahahaha, I'm making the same thing. Already halfway through my second 988."
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,plethomacademia,2,Tue Jul 7 21:40:51 2015 UTC,You should share pictures! I've been following another person's blog who is working on this. It's fun to see everyone's progress.

CrossStitch,3cdi1d,plethomacademia,2,Wed Jul 8 01:01:25 2015 UTC,Nice progress! Even have some of those evil clouds done. There's so many of those.
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,supbanana,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:24:54 2015 UTC,Yeah :( I get kind of obsessed with hitting the corners/edges to make sure that I actually did measure the right amount of fabric. The result is clouds.
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,supbanana,2,Wed Jul 8 18:12:37 2015 UTC,"Do you have a link to the blog?  (Sorry to be all over this post, I just couldn't find anyone else that had done Pixel Comfort's pattern and would love to see other people's progress!)"
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,supbanana,3,Wed Jul 8 02:01:12 2015 UTC,Sure! I've been following her through tumblr here: http://craftinggeek.tumblr.com/ but she shares through instagram and twitter and I think she has a full blog too.
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,AsphodelNyx,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:23:39 2015 UTC,"Oh god, is she using 14 count?! I can't imagine how big that will be.   Edit: I should mention, I'm doing 18. I wanted 22 but couldn't find any in short notice and just used some scrap 18 instead."
CrossStitch,3cdi1d,AsphodelNyx,2,Wed Jul 8 18:16:29 2015 UTC,"I believe the blogger did the dark world map on 14 count already and it's amazing. I'm doing 14 count myself and it's a little over 18"" square."

CrossStitch,3c8iz6,smwmd,5,Sun Jul 5 23:26:54 2015 UTC,"Gorgeous. Just absolutely stunning. Your mom is going to love it!  Yes, backstitching makes a huge difference but it is my least favorite part. I absolutely hate doing it, so my projects usually get to that stage and then linger there for way too long. In the case of this project of yours it was absolutely worth it. It looks great after the backstitching. Great job!"
CrossStitch,3c8iz6,Witchymommy,2,Mon Jul 6 00:36:51 2015 UTC,"It was definitely the most frustrating part, I mis-stitched there more than anywhere else. But, it was so worth it!"
CrossStitch,3c8iz6,PhoenixRising1221,2,Mon Jul 6 13:16:35 2015 UTC,Same here. I finished a Woodland Enchantress kit and it sat for over a year before I touched it again and that was only because I saw someone else post about their's and decided I actually wanted to finish it.
CrossStitch,3c8iz6,Witchymommy,2,Mon Jul 6 19:34:02 2015 UTC,"I've had a very large (around 2ft long by 1ft high) one of zebras done all but the backstitching for 10 years. I just can't make myself finish it. It is SO MUCH backstitching. I get it out once in a while and make a little progress and then just can't do it anymore. I've worked on, and finished so many other projects in that time. I have a feeling that at this rate it will be another decade before I finally finish it."
CrossStitch,3c8iz6,PhoenixRising1221,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:49:15 2015 UTC,"Oh my, I think you win. How long did that take you? The biggest I've done so far is 20"" x 16"" and that took a few years off and on."
CrossStitch,3c8iz6,Witchymommy,2,Mon Jul 6 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"Probably about a year. Thankfully it has a lot of open space, so it wasn't as bad as some. I've done one bigger, it was of a geisha with a very elaborate kimono. Thank one took forever, but had less backstitching so it actually got finished. I think I might get around to finishing the zebras if I had a person in mind to give it to, but since I don't every other project gets bumped to the top of the list. It helps that all the other projects have less backstitching. :-)"
CrossStitch,3c8iz6,galaxy911,4,Mon Jul 6 21:34:24 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I have done a big project and I think ""bleh, nobody will care about the backstitching"" .. but this really is one of those reminders as to why it is so important.  Beautiful work also! Your patience is amazing."

I've seen patterns like that on Etsy that you can get.   I'm already married and I'm tempted to make one for my husband and myself!

CrossStitch,3c9ax8,Engineer14,2,Tue Jul 7 15:54:30 2015 UTC,"I like the design!  Just some quick questions here:     What size floss are you using?  How many strands of floss?  It's hard to tell when zoomed in on this image.  Similarly, are all your Xes crossing over the same way (too blurry to tell)...that's the most common self-taught mistake I have seen; the image will tend to lie more flat and appear more ordered if all your crosses have the same line over and under."
CrossStitch,3c9ax8,ometzo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:52:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure but I am using DMC floss. I can look when I get home. Two strands. Yep I made sure to always go the same way.   I haven't done anything else with it, i.e. wash it. Is that just something like Woolite in the sink?  Thanks you for your praise!  I'm enjoying myself."

CrossStitch,3c8y5y,StephanieBeavs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:04:15 2015 UTC,I got mine at JoAnn Fabrics. There are a few by this same company that I think are really cute. It comes in a kit and the thread colors used are so much brighter and more vibrant than the pattern even shows. It's stunning! :)

CrossStitch,3c8ewz,redditreaderonly,11,Mon Jul 6 01:49:02 2015 UTC,You can upload the pattern to pic 2 pat and it will show a grid of it. You can decide how large you want it and what count of aida you're using.
CrossStitch,3c5wv2,Dalekette,4,Sun Jul 5 03:10:00 2015 UTC,"It's adorable.   So this may be a dumb question, but I've seen a few posts lately done on t-shirts and fabric like the onesie and it made me wonder. How do you cross-stitch on fabric like that and get such perfect even little squares (since it's not already gridded out that way like Aida)?"
CrossStitch,3c5wv2,Witchymommy,3,Sun Jul 5 14:02:01 2015 UTC,"it's called waste cloth, here is a picture of one I was working on; the one I used I just pulled out each strand with a pair of tweezers, once I got the hang of it, it didn't take long at all.   oh and here is my finished product, you can see mine isn't perfect (gaps in the dark brown, it was my first cross stitch ever) but overall it looks pretty good for being stitched on a onesie"
CrossStitch,3c5wv2,CrystalKU,2,Sun Jul 5 15:11:39 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but I know a lot of people use a water-soluble grid for the squares. When you wash the fabric, it'll disintegrate, leaving you with nice even squares on your fabric"
CrossStitch,3c5wv2,mjforever33,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:34:36 2015 UTC,Very cool. Found it on Amazon. I'm thrilled. I had no idea it existed. Thanks!
CrossStitch,3c5wv2,Witchymommy,2,Sun Jul 5 15:56:38 2015 UTC,This was the first time I've done it actually. I used waste canvas. You secure it to whatever you are stitching on and it provides your grid. Then you pull out the strings when you're and you get your finished product! I think they have other types as well but that's the kind I used.

CrossStitch,3c6bwh,thebobomb,8,Sun Jul 5 06:31:23 2015 UTC,Look into getting a water-soluble pen (they are blue). They can be found at most fabric/crafting stores. They're kinda a quilters thing.  As for saving the project... wash it?
CrossStitch,3c6bwh,sarynkitamo,6,Sun Jul 5 06:33:26 2015 UTC,"Well having seen the pic of the project, it's not THAT bad. I'd stop where you are and attempt to wash a small section of what is already there. If it does come out you're golden, you'll be able to wash the whole thing when you're done and should be fine. Highlighter comes out of clothing so this should be okay.   If it's still visible, there are no mistakes in a cross stitch just a design discrepancy."
CrossStitch,3c6bwh,DanceyPants93,7,Sun Jul 5 16:04:18 2015 UTC,"If it's still visible, there are no mistakes in a cross stitch just a design discrepancy.  TRUTH. No one's going to walk up to your cross stitch with the original pattern in hand to compare the pattern to your version to make sure it's correct. (And if someone does, well that's weird and you shouldn't worry about it anyway.) No one will know if you have to fudge something--they'll just think it's a part of the style."
CrossStitch,3c6bwh,yolibrarian,3,Sun Jul 5 16:30:27 2015 UTC,"Highlighters are great for keeping track of what you've stitched on the paper pattern. For the fabric, most people prefer the 10X10 grid that's seen on the pattern. Some stitch the grid on with fishing line or tatting thread, while others draw it on with a water soluble marker. Markers are like $2 at most craft stores, and fishing line can be super cheap as well.   Highlighter is tricky to remove in some fabrics. The easiest was is to set it on a clean towel and blot at the stain with rubbing alcohol or non-acetone nail polish remover. Once the stain is gone, rinse with cold water. I'm not sure what kind of floss you're using, so test some for colorfastness before doing your whole project."
CrossStitch,3c6bwh,teardrop87,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:45:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think I misread the highlighter tip haha. Thanks for the advice, I'll try some rubbing alcohol. I'll definitely have to grab one of those markers as well."

CrossStitch,3c47fm,pamazon63,7,Sat Jul 4 20:09:53 2015 UTC,"really great piece! I bet your boyfriend is going to love it!!  give it a light wash, then a press.  fill the sink with luke warm water add a few drops of dish soap, let the cross stitch soak for awhile. swish it about, give it a rinse till the water runs clear. don't wring it or bunch it, lift it by 2 corners and let the majority of the water drip off, lay it on a towel and blot it mostly dry. when you press it, iron it from the back making sure you don't snag any loose thread.  it's really easy to stretch needle work yourself, all you need  is a piece of  foam core from your local frame shop and pin it with straight pins, here is a link to an album I have on imgur.  http://imgur.com/a/XE73R    you'll be much happier with the framed work if you press it and stretch it!"

CrossStitch,3c47fm,emmajen,3,Sun Jul 5 03:28:01 2015 UTC,"is your floss DMC? you might want to see if it's colourfast if its not DMC. Touch it with a damp white cloth and see if there's any yellow on it afterward. and depending on the size, you might not even have to stretch it if it's totally flat and the lines are straight, you'll be able to tell as soon as you put a mat on it. try a dark brown mat if you're not happy with the yellow"

CrossStitch,3c1fef,bitxilore,5,Fri Jul 3 23:13:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I made the patterns myself. It's never too early to teach colour theory! I planned ahead so it would all work out, I didn't just sit down and stitch. :)  I was inspired by a similar post on here a while back."
CrossStitch,3c1fef,bitxilore,2,Fri Jul 3 23:25:05 2015 UTC,Ah that's cool!  I really love the flags - my BF is Canadian and I'm American so if/when we have kids they'll have the same split.

CrossStitch,3c10rg,layerkate,2,Fri Jul 3 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"I love mine! Now go get you some double pointed needles! It takes a bit to get used to using the two handed technique if you've been using a standard hoop forever, but you'll be amazed at how much faster your stitching becomes. They cut my stitch time in half.  Also, consider nailing a flat piece of wood under one side. The ability to sit on that piece really stabilizes it and makes stitching more comfortable/maneuverable. (Like so: https://www.google.com/search?q=sit+on+scroll+frame&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&client=safari#imgrc=d0FBufNGXXOZzM%3A)"
CrossStitch,3c10rg,AllNaturalSweetener,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:53:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip! I've never heard of double ended needles before. I will definitely be buying some of those.

They look like this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001141CUG/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_EjYMvb55G0WWZ  Most craft stores carry them and all the needlework catalogues/specialty embroidery or quilting shops definitely will have them.

CrossStitch,3c10rg,KatenBaten,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:57:40 2015 UTC,Do you own the same model that's in the link? Seems pretty affordable.
CrossStitch,3c10rg,AllNaturalSweetener,3,Tue Jul 7 00:18:27 2015 UTC,"I do! Works great. Have a larger, much more expensive as well but I much prefer the former. I bought a set of 3 different sized scrolls on Amazon a while back and those are great as well. I can rotate between projects without unscrolling/resetting and use virtually any sized fabric that way. They screw on and off in seconds so it's easier to travel with too. :)"
CrossStitch,3c10rg,KatenBaten,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:31:11 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Thanks for the info. I love working on the scroll frame as opposed to embroidery hoops, but my left side gets stiff holding up the heavier frame. I definitely want to give this a try."

CrossStitch,3bwco4,Tatmom,16,Thu Jul 2 18:21:08 2015 UTC,I hated the DMC stickers. After a while they completely fell off. I have a P-Touch label maker so that's how I'm labeling on the plastic. It is taking a while to switch everything over but it will be worth it when it's done!
CrossStitch,3bwco4,why_itsme,3,Thu Jul 2 18:24:05 2015 UTC,"I was going to ask the same thing. This is just lovely. I have mine half and half, and would love to get everything switched over to plastic. But boy is it a project!"

CrossStitch,3c0och,momo4020,2,Fri Jul 3 18:16:59 2015 UTC,In a sense. I work for a small company that dues linen for cross stitch and every once in a while I get a free piece. These are some of our discontinued colors.
CrossStitch,3c0och,heikurashi,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:12:47 2015 UTC,"I have. It was a weird size piece, so I decided it was cheaper and easier than purchasing black aida or stitching the entire background. It takes about 30 minutes from start to finish, with 20 of that spent watching netflix and stirring. It's not difficult if you're going for a dark color. Lighter tones take less time, but require more attention. After you've rinsed the excess dye off, soak the piece in a 50/50 mix of vinger water. That sets the dye, and prevents if from running when you wash it later. The fabric becomes super soft, so you definitely need a hoop to stitch with. A 5 gallon bucket set in the tub is the easiest way to dye. There's little risk of staining the porcelain, cold rinse water is at hand, and clean up is so much easier.  If you want more than the whole piece dyed one color, I'd pay to have it done."
CrossStitch,3c0och,teardrop87,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:03:05 2015 UTC,"I've painted it with acrylic paint & textile medium, as I wanted a sort of mottled wash look, plus I didn't want to make a lot of dye for a little bit of cloth. It actually worked out pretty well."
CrossStitch,3c0och,aethelberga,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:42:59 2015 UTC,"I used Tulip dye on my fabric once. It created a wonderfully even colour but no matter how many times I washed it, it would bleed slightly. My piece didn't get dirty while I was stitching so I got away with simply ironing it when I was done."
CrossStitch,3c0och,Kwerkii,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:45:52 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of options for dying fabric :)  There is your basic dying (I've used Rit dyes). You follow the instructions, dunk the fabric in, follow instructions and it's done :)  I've used Dye-na-flow by Jacquard to make some smaller ""tie dye"" type pieces.  There's ice dying with powdered dyes.  There's sun dying with liquid dyes   And then acrylic paint and textile medium :)"
CrossStitch,3c0och,Gotherella,0,Sat Jul 4 14:55:48 2015 UTC,"I've never dyed cross stitch fabric, but I've dyed other fabric in general. Rule of thumb is always try it out on a sample piece of fabric before you try it out on your actual fabric in case the color is wrong or doesn't stick or looks marbled or something.  I've used Rit dye to dye my fabric."

CrossStitch,3by6nl,punkpixzsticks,3,Fri Jul 3 03:41:33 2015 UTC,I agree with this. It really depends how many other stitches it affects. If there's a large section all one stitch off because of one mistake I just have to leave the project for a bit out of anger.

CrossStitch,3by6nl,becausefrog,15,Fri Jul 3 03:44:40 2015 UTC,"I love the Bronte sisters, and when I was younger I read every book I could get about them. One of the stories that I read about their childhood was how they would have to sew their samplers, but then pick all the stitches out again to stitch another because they couldn't afford to buy new thread all the time, and it takes a lot of practice to learn the art like a lady. So when I have to pluck, I just remember that and feel better, like I'm in good company."

CrossStitch,3by6nl,scarrlet,2,Fri Jul 3 06:17:49 2015 UTC,I had the same thing happen the other night. The colours looked pretty close on the bobbin so I was hopeful I could just leave it but once I started stitching with the right colour the difference was really noticeable. It was expensive floss too so I was pretty annoyed.
CrossStitch,3by6nl,HomeopathicH2O,2,Fri Jul 3 07:52:46 2015 UTC,"Awh, that's unfortunate. I hope your restart goes well."
CrossStitch,3by6nl,cheaky_,3,Fri Jul 3 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on the level of the mistake and when I notice. If I catch it while I'm still working on that strand, I'll unpick. Same color, and I'll think about it. If I've done a bunch more work and I can fudge around it, I'll leave it. It's it's an important detail, I sigh, throw it down, and ignore it for a week or so. Then I pull out the seam ripper, and fix it."
CrossStitch,3by6nl,hugitoutguys,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:21:54 2015 UTC,I'm a huge perfectionist so it's really hard for me to leave ANY mistake I notice. :c

CrossStitch,3bx9jy,heartslobs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:17:39 2015 UTC,You are brilliant. Another thing to put on my to learn list: how to reverse-search the images.
CrossStitch,3bx9jy,mindlessroman,3,Thu Jul 2 23:19:54 2015 UTC,"n'aww i'll teach you now; it's super easy, although it might be because i'm on chrome. but i just right hand click the picture and 'search google for this image' is an option.   alternatively, you can open https://images.google.com/ and press the camera button in the search bar. it will either let you search by a link or by using a photo saved on your computer.  (as a tangent sidenote, i randomly used to put in my selfies to see what google would show the 'related to this image' as and found 4 facebook accounts pretending to be me. it's super handy!)"
CrossStitch,3bvq6v,honeycombhive,2,Thu Jul 2 15:22:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't cross-stitched in over a year and thought this would be a good way to get my groove going again!

I did just buy their Christmas kit this morning, and spent the extra money for the case, so I'm hoping that's an incentive to actually finish it!  Thanks!!  :)"

CrossStitch,3bx86q,Freckled_daywalker,2,Thu Jul 2 22:13:35 2015 UTC,I'm also looking for a finishing service too. Hopefully someone has a good recommendation.
CrossStitch,3bx86q,Piece0fpi,2,Fri Jul 3 00:24:46 2015 UTC,"If you have a local cross stitch store, I'd go in there and ask the people working first. A lot of those ladies are multi-talented, with years of experience. If you don't, I'd probably Google/ask around for tailors or seamstresses or something like that. Talk to people who sew for a living and ask if they know anybody with the particular skill-set to complete that project. People working at fabric stores and whatnot. Maybe even upholsterers."
CrossStitch,3bx86q,iliketoarmdance,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:57:48 2015 UTC,"No local cross stitch store (the closest is several hours away) and I've tried the local craft/fabric stores. I even asked several local tailors but no one seems comfortable with working with an original stitched piece. It's so frustrating. I've been spoiled my whole life by having an expert seamstress for a grandmother but at 95 her eyes just can't handle it anymore. I wish she were closer so she could talk me through it, but alas... Thanks for the response though!"
CrossStitch,3bx86q,iliketoarmdance,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:18:08 2015 UTC,"Are you asking these people if they know anyone else who might be able to do it?

Just keep asking around and a qualified stitcher will come out of the woodworks. :)"
CrossStitch,3bx86q,iliketoarmdance,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:23:26 2015 UTC,"I really have tried. I live in an area where most of the population is young and transient, there just aren't the kind of networks of locals here that you find in other areas. I've tried craigslist, the local swap websites and my local subreddit is a deadzone. I would much rather work with someone I can meet face to face but after 2 months of asking everyone I can think of and then some, I thought I'd try here as well.  Edit: I should add that I've met plenty of people with the sewing skills to do it but no one who is comfortable doing it with my stitched piece because they don't want to be responsible if it gets damaged."

CrossStitch,3bx86q,LuluThePirateHooker,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"Do you have a sewing machine? If you can't find anyone to do it for you, you could maybe try a couple of practice runs on material you don't mind wasting.  Pinning the piping on a round piece is a bit of a pain, but once you get it pinned you're good to go.  This is an easy to follow set of directions: Piping Instructions  Edit to add this:  If you haven't tried, you can also check with a local quilt group.  A lot of my mom's friends do side projects for people and most of them know all kinds of sewing (not just quilting).    Good luck :)"
CrossStitch,3bx86q,LuluThePirateHooker,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:37:34 2015 UTC,"Honestly, that's my last resort. I hate sewing. I'd much rather pay someone else to do this than spend the time and effort I'd need to put in to feel confident doing this. I don't get much crafty time, and the time I do get, I'd rather stitch. If worse comes to worse, I'll probably just frame the piece, but I know my sister in law would really love the pillow so I'm trying everything I know. I've not found any quilting groups in my area, but I'll keep looking. Thanks for the help!"
CrossStitch,3bxeqf,tourmaline82,4,Thu Jul 2 23:07:02 2015 UTC,"I would open the original photo in an editing program and play around with the color saturation levels a little bit, trying a few different versions in the PCStitch pattern generator to see if it makes a difference.   This is not something I have played around with much, but that's a trick /u/Snozzcumber_ once mentioned. A while back they made the best photo-to-cross stitch conversion I think I've ever seen (it didn't have any of those weird color blotch artifacts that sometimes pop up), so I have to think it must be pretty solid advice. Check the comments on that post for more info."
CrossStitch,3bxeqf,iliketoarmdance,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:52:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is an awesome piece! Thing is, I'm not much good with photo editing and I've already done enough in the original pattern that I'm reluctant to change said pattern too much at this point. I think it'll look decent if I replace the pink and dark turquoise with reddish-tan and dark navy. I'll definitely write that down to do in my next photo cross stitch project though! Maybe I can coax my sister to edit the next photo."
CrossStitch,3bxeqf,teardrop87,2,Fri Jul 3 03:58:29 2015 UTC,"The forelock looks navy on my screen, so I see why the program chose a bluish tone. I would do a navy blue instead of the turquoise if you feel it's too bright. I'm not sure about the  pink. That and the bright white spot look funny to me. It looks like they need to be toned down a little, but I have no clue how."
CrossStitch,3bxeqf,Kwerkii,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:59:55 2015 UTC,"I'm currently picking out the pink, it's driving me nuts. :/ I think I might replace it with a blend of 3859 and 3864, I have those both already and it looks decent in the PCStitch preview.

CrossStitch,3bwp5t,iliketoarmdance,3,Fri Jul 3 00:12:55 2015 UTC,"Are you using tapestry needles? They're slightly blunted on the end, so they're not as pointy as regular embroidery needles. Cross stitch doesn't usually need a sharp because the fabric already has holes in it."
CrossStitch,3bwp5t,Kwerkii,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:00:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, I use gold plated tapestry needles, and they are a dream! But I also do add beads to a lot of projects, which is where a lot of the poking comes in.   Worse, though, is pushing through stitches and having the pressure from the the back/eye of the needle making a callous on the side of my finger (ending threads, for instance, running the needle behind a row of stitching on the back, or if I'm going really quickly through a repetitive section)."
CrossStitch,3bw62z,spicycashew,5,Thu Jul 2 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"I'd save the perle for embroidery projects, or as special accents on cross stitch pieces. Stick with your 6-stranded floss for the bulk of cross stitching. :)"

I would only use the perle floss for stitching on fabric below 11 count. Since you normally use all 6 strands anyways, the unseperated perle would give it a different shine and texture."

If you're trying to learn how to design typography, like what sort of fonts go together and stuff, I'd again suggest pinterest or google searching ""typography how to"" or even ""subway art how to"" or ""combining fonts"" or ""typography and layout""  good luck!

CrossStitch,3bw5wc,AmeliaPondPandorica,4,Thu Jul 2 17:23:02 2015 UTC,"Lines are made thicker by adding more thread. Either add more strands to your needle, or repeat the stitch until it appears thick enough."
CrossStitch,3bw5wc,teardrop87,2,Thu Jul 2 17:41:13 2015 UTC,use more thread?
CrossStitch,3bw5wc,weemacmeal,0,Thu Jul 2 17:35:47 2015 UTC,Other than that?
CrossStitch,3bw5wc,weemacmeal,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:37:42 2015 UTC,"What about the kind of thread that's used to make friendship bracelets? I've tried that before, however it's pretty tough to work with if your using a small aida!"
CrossStitch,3bw5wc,iliketoarmdance,2,Thu Jul 2 18:41:26 2015 UTC,http://www.dmc-usa.com/Education/Technique-Overviews/Embroidery/Embroidery-Stitch-Guide.aspx  You could try something like couching or a laced running stitch for a thicker line without adding more strands. You can look up types of embroidery stitches to find more options that might work for your purposes. :)

CrossStitch,3bs9ei,_ak_,3,Wed Jul 1 19:02:25 2015 UTC,I don't think cardboard is a good thing to use.  It's not archival so over time it could break down and destroy the fabric.  I use foamcore to mount which is what the pros use
CrossStitch,3bs9ei,enelyaisil,3,Thu Jul 2 03:25:15 2015 UTC,"I was just about to say the same thing. Cardboard is acidic, so it will yellow and turn the fabric nasty over time. Same with the frame - make sure it's made of real wood and not mdf... And while we're at it, ensure the mat (if used) is also acid-free."
CrossStitch,3bs9ei,Samberto,3,Thu Jul 2 04:50:33 2015 UTC,"Yes! I came here to say this! I work in custom framing; foam core is what you want for framing any sort of needlework. It allows you to stretch it appropriately (like a canvas painting, the fabric needs to be stretched), and pin it through the foam center!"

CrossStitch,3bpwf8,mojowitchcraft,4,Wed Jul 1 13:47:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, Stitchrovia's shop on etsy. I think they were around $13 each when I bought them; pattern only. Totally worth it though!"
CrossStitch,3bpwf8,lickthecowhappy,3,Wed Jul 1 13:52:26 2015 UTC,stitchrovia's patterns are mad expensive but they are so nice!
CrossStitch,3btrw2,cyaspacesamurai,4,Thu Jul 2 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"I'd wager that the regular Aida came out because the stitched area was so small. I would NOT recommend using regular Aida in lieu of waste canvas for your actual projects. Waste canvas is not THAT expensive when you think about the time invested into a cross stitch project. It would suck to take the time and effort to finish something, only to have it end up completely unusable. Here is an excellent guide to using waste canvas."
CrossStitch,3btrw2,iliketoarmdance,3,Thu Jul 2 02:28:30 2015 UTC,DMC makes a water-soluble fabric that you can use. It washes away in water once you've made the design. I want to try it.
CrossStitch,3btrw2,sarynkitamo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:54:12 2015 UTC,DMC water-soluble is fantastic! Sulky also makes a soluable stabilizer with a pre-printed grid on it (I haven't tried the sulky brand yet)

CrossStitch,3braqp,teardrop87,4,Wed Jul 1 15:58:39 2015 UTC,"It's not ruined. Take a break while you run to a drug store for fine point tweezers. Tease the thread out with a needle, then tug with the tweezers. It might take a while, but it can be done."
CrossStitch,3braqp,Companion_Oswin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:49:14 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I took a long break from it because I was getting frustrated.  I just sat down with pins and was able to pull some of the blue threads out.  I'll focus on it some more later, but atleast I know how I can fix it.  I thought that the threads were messed up and just gonna be stuck."
CrossStitch,3braqp,heartslobs,3,Wed Jul 1 20:10:17 2015 UTC,"It's totally salvageable, I had the same problem doing one. It takes some patience but you'll get it, I jumped around pulling out the canvas. Start from another side and work toward the middle, as the edges come out, it all starts to loosen up more to get the tougher pieces. Good luck!"

CrossStitch,3bpz6i,Wonderland44,8,Wed Jul 1 05:25:34 2015 UTC,Someone on here had their bird peck a hole in the fabric. They put a small piece of aida underneath the hole and then stitched through both fabrics for that area. She said you couldn't tell the difference afterward and it fixed the problem. I will try to find the post.
CrossStitch,3bpz6i,Boldly_GoingNowhere,5,Wed Jul 1 23:45:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how to fix it, but the cause is definitely the hoop screw... which I'm sure you realized. __^  What if you sewed in a small square to cover the hole?"
CrossStitch,3bpz6i,sarynkitamo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 08:10:16 2015 UTC,"Seconding this.  Two ways I can think of to sew in something to cover the hole:  One, cut a small (dime-sized) piece of very sheer white fabric and cover the hole with it. If it's thin enough, you should be  able to stitch through both the sheer fabric and the aida in the area around the hole, and then when you get to the hole, do your stitch and then decide if maybe you need to stitch another right on top of it to try to get it to be the same thickness as the surrounding stitches.  Second, take thin white thread and a thin needle and try to weave in a cross hatch. It's probably a good idea to poke a hole in a scrap of aida and practice fixing it on a scrap instead of on the actual piece you've been working on for weeks.  I definitely think this is fixable."
CrossStitch,3bpz6i,t0xie,2,Wed Jul 1 14:49:19 2015 UTC,Is it in an area where you will be stitching over?
CrossStitch,3bpz6i,DamnImLost,2,Wed Jul 1 11:47:01 2015 UTC,Unfortunately it is.
CrossStitch,3bpz6i,DamnImLost,2,Wed Jul 1 18:22:11 2015 UTC,"Then I'd do something similar to what has already been suggested. Either try to attach a small piece of aida on the back of the hole, try to align it as good as possible to the front piece and then simply stitch over it. Or try to weave a cross hatch with sewing thread."
CrossStitch,3bpz6i,Twin6878,3,Wed Jul 1 18:35:38 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing.  In fact, I think it's better that you need to stitch over the hole, it will help cover it up.  If it wasn't stitched over it would be difficult to fix."

CrossStitch,3bkv8d,Ohsewnerdy,13,Tue Jun 30 01:25:40 2015 UTC,"No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.  It is so ordered."

CrossStitch,3blth2,erinhasguts,5,Tue Jun 30 06:56:54 2015 UTC,I personally don't. I find the stiffness helps with the stitching. I feel like it would warp more if you washed it first. I mean it's just starched I think so you could re-stiffen it if you wanted to but it's easier to just not wash it first.
CrossStitch,3blth2,DanceyPants93,2,Tue Jun 30 21:17:11 2015 UTC,"I don't work much on aida cloth, but I do tend to wash my fabric before stitching on it. If I  wash, dry, and iron a piece of fabric and the folds still don't come out of it, I will not use it.  I'd rather find out before I start stitching that the fabric is not going to look good.    Go ahead and hand wash it.  Just make sure it's completely dry before putting it in the hoop. It's also probably a good idea to not store it in the hoop, but that's entirely up to you."
CrossStitch,3blth2,t0xie,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:52:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure but it might lose its shape and warp in a hoop after washing. I always found that the stiffness helps preventing that. But I've never worked with aida that was so stiff that I had problems with it and I don't know the brand that you're using, so if you have problems otherwise, I'd just try it with a smaller peace, maybe there is a quick project you can do for yourself where it does not matter should the finished peace be warped a bit."

CrossStitch,3bi6k8,dragon-pet,10,Mon Jun 29 12:43:39 2015 UTC,"i think it's an interesting idea but the whole article seemed kind of distant to me. i'm not in any cross stitch circles, i don't follow any cross stitch blogs and i'm not well known though blogging or other means. theoretically, i could be stealing hundreds of patterns and no-one would notice because i'm not really involved in the online community, aside from posting on reddit which still gives me a sense of anonymity. even if someone did notice, i don't really think there could be any consequences like..""this reddit user called heartslobs stole your designs but we don't know who they are or what their email is and they could just re-make an account and come back so that's that.""  therefore, it seems like the solution the blogger is suggesting isn't really that helpful. it would only catch out those who are within these circles or who are actively looking for praise/attention through social networking. basically, it's a way of the blogging community to self-regulate but that community is probably very small in comparison to the people who aren't in it at all. it feels kind of tokenistic in this sense.   i feel the real issue is where the stolen files are being uploaded to and who is uploading them. if i wanted to steal, a community of bloggers wouldn't stop me if the resources were available."
CrossStitch,3bi6k8,heartslobs,5,Mon Jun 29 14:15:59 2015 UTC,From my understanding of the article it was more centered on the uploaders and resellers of patterns that were made by someone else. You would be correct in stating that it's really not something that could be regulated from people just posting WIPs.. The whole idea just seems silly. I don't know how it would help honestly. It would be very easy to just say 'oh I can't find my order number' or something similar.
CrossStitch,3bi6k8,Kynhalis,8,Mon Jun 29 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"There is a real problem with pattern ""sharing"" in the cross stitch world. We've lost a lot of great designers over the years, and more are falling away all the time.   I don't feel that posting a cover of your pattern (or order details, which are useful only to the person you bought the pattern from) is going to help terribly. The people who do so clearly buy the patterns. But people who don't either steal, don't bother, or have no idea this is a thing.  I don't plan on changing the way I post WIP pictures to my blog. I buy everything I stitch, but I don't feel I need to prove it. However, if doing so would bring back my favourite designers, I would change my tune. Right now, this just feels like wearing an awareness ribbon without donating to the cause, if you know what I mean.  Still, it is a reasonable idea and I'm sure it will gain some traction."
CrossStitch,3bi6k8,silverlotus152,13,Mon Jun 29 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"I guess my question is, those of us who continue to post WIPs on our blog, are we now suddenly going to be 'policed' by folks who take it upon themselves to look for WIP pictures on social media that do not have what the blogger is asking for?   For instance, I use my blog as on online journal of my stitching. It is VERY formulaic in how I post, be it WIP, UFO or finish. I do this so that if I wish to restitch a project, I can quickly and easily find the posts where I have all of the pertinent information. As I frequently change things in a design, I need to know this information.   If I do not post the receipt and/or order # along with the WIP, am I going to start looking forward to posts shaming me for not doing so? I certainly hope not. IDK about anyone else, but I am sitting on a stash collection of about 20+ years. This means at last count I have about around 500 hard copy charts that I have legitimately purchased through other stitchers, online and brick and mortar shops, eBay, Etsy, and more. I do not have ANY of those receipts. Does this mean I cannot stitch what I have previously purchased, lest I face the wrath of an anonymous person with an internet connection, excessive amounts of free time and an axe to grind? Does this now mean that I am stuck stitching just my HAEDs?  As those are practically the only ones I can get order numbers from without spending a great deal of time picking through PayPal in order to get order numbers, I find such limitations...constrictive.   Additionally, who is going to be the ones 'policing' this? Designers have enough on their plates without having to add the burden of trolling every social media platform looking for folks who do not do this. I know Diane Williams of Little House Needleworks is battling cancer right now, so I quite imagine that neither she nor her daughter, Nikki Lehman of country Cottage Needleworks, nor her son who now owns Crescent Colours floss, are actively participating in any that nor do they have the time, even if the inclination was there.   I find the idea well intentioned, however, however, like you, this may wind up being more trouble than it's worth, while simultaneously opening up a whole other world of unintended consequences.  As always, my two copper."
CrossStitch,3bi6k8,Kaneto-San,2,Mon Jun 29 20:16:49 2015 UTC,"I have the same opinion. I'm always careful not to post any part of the patterns or anything.  But I have 14 years of stitching stash. Same as you from all sorts of sources, including some given to me from people who aren't stitching anymore etc. I'm not going to be doing this, I put enough effort into the stitching, taking good pictures and making videos for Flosstube."

No receipt for those either! :)  I understand where this lady is coming from, and again, I really do think she means well. But I do not think this is practical at all."
CrossStitch,3bi6k8,Kaneto-San,7,Wed Jul 1 01:34:48 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with the idea, it's really sad that people are stealing from the artists who make those patterns, but i really don't agree with her solution.  I feel like expecting people to dredge up their order details and post them when they're posting a picture of a finished piece is a bit ridiculous. Very few people are going to be willing to make the effort to do that, I know I wouldn't, and I highly doubt that the creators of the patterns are going to go through all those social media and blog posts checking that people have actually ordered the patterns instead of obtaining them through other means.  I also thinks it's pretty stupid that she mentions a way to catch people who are spreading stolen designs and then doesn't say what it is. I get that she doesn't want to encourage other people to spread designs, but i feel like it would potentially help other people figure which designs are stolen so they can be avoided. I know I've come across designs on pinterest that I'm fairly certain were stolen and there were probably many more, but it's impossible to tell which patterns are stolen and which patterns are available for free with permission from the owner."
CrossStitch,3bi6k8,erinhasguts,2,Mon Jun 29 15:27:52 2015 UTC,I don't understand why you would take a pic of a wip with the pattern next to it to start with.

I never sell or post pics of these things, I haven't even given them away as gifts. Is this out of line?"
