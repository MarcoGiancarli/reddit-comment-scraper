Bravenewbies,3e2q6n,LSkyNLX,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:50:50 2015 UTC,"A big problem you will run into is that if everyone is doing market trading and industry than there will be very little money in it. The reason Brave used to be able to sustain a large amount of marketeers and industrials was because of the massive amounts of ratting isk that came in.   Also any large scale marketeer (I know from experience) will never have isk to spend. If they are truely opperating at a scale that can help supply the alliance they will always be isk poor and asset rich because they will have items on the market. They can skim off of what they import but once you get to a certain size you will do nothing but setting up orders, moving orders, preparing the next order.  But after saying all of that, if brave would still be Ok with an outsider coming to teach a market class I think Dave Korhol can vouch for Rommel45 as an experienced market trader that can give pointers to everyone."

My concern was that i was lookin for solo fights and my opponents almost always had friends backin them up.  So yesterday evening i fleeted up with Solomon, hopped on mumble and we headed out. As we undocked i set up the fleet advert and announced it in corp chat.  We got our first kill shortly after. Solomon went down before the Comet popped. Fleet went up by 2 at this point and i chose a novice plex in Onatoh to hold down while Solomon was reshipping.  You know the rest of the story.  This is exactly what i'm here for.

With less need to grind and hold a grid and more need to perform hit and runs on targets of opportunity, Thoraxes provide a doctrine that's better suited to the latter (than moa's) without any off training (Gallente cruiser being a prereq for Domi's, and the core of the ratting line.)

Bravenewbies,3dxj63,Roman_Drex,2,Mon Jul 20 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"The graph in the post you replied to already has the sig and speed calculated into the tankyness.   As of the range: The Thorax would have a pretty good advantage with Sensor Integrity-Links and Spike while staying 75-80km off the enemy. But the t1-fits will limit us to 65km (iron) or 58km (tungsten), which is barely 10km more than the optimal range with the same ammo on the Moa.  In the end, it's a sacrifice of the survivability of the fleet for a bit higher damage, while not approaching the real issue we have with our doctrin(s): we are locked into termal/kinetic. If you look at bl's T3-fits, you will realize, that they fit specifically for that: 2 termic + 1 kinetic + 1 eanm. The PocketRocket doesn't help here and is instead a fleet, that just tries to kill some of the opponents before losing inevitably and would get dumpstered by every 25man talwar-fleet."

Can't remember exactly), I'm not at my computer but when I ran some contracts yesterday there was a lot higher rewarding for less collateral contracts above you.  I apologise as I know your a major market maker which we need in ansunou right now but PERSONALLY I would rather move a bill collateral shipment for 15mil than a 5bill.  Probably not what you want to hear but double that reward and it will fly (not by me I'm off on holiday tomorrow)  Good luck I hope to see the market stocked on my return.  7o"
Bravenewbies,3dvuda,VoodooRin,3,Sun Jul 19 23:41:48 2015 UTC,"This seems to be the root of the problem.  I too have few contracts that are 300k+ m3 and 2+ bil collateral. I used freight calculator to calculate price.  I think it should be adjusted. Sure it is dirt cheap, but if it leads that some customers will put tip and get ahead of queue then it kinda sucks. I am happy to pay more, but I have no idea how much more I should pay.   With high volume, high collateral Black Frog is much more convenient way to import currently."

Bravenewbies,3dvuda,Frekavichk,2,Mon Jul 20 23:44:06 2015 UTC,"40m for 50km3 would cost 272 mil for 1 shippment. At this point, I would rather use Black Frog which hauls my stuff for half price from Jita to Aunsou.  I prefer system with set prices so everyone has same rules without confusion. If you want to get top of the queue, pay rush price. Much better system when you regurarly move shit. You always now what it costs, how much it about takes to deliver.   With ""pay whatever you want or get expired"" system like this. There is no way to predict what amount if isk gets you speedy delivery or not."
Bravenewbies,3dvuda,ssg-,3,Tue Jul 21 07:50:02 2015 UTC,Guess what.  Folks who pay more than the calculator says on Black Frog contracts get their contracts run first as well.  There's literally no way to stop that from happening.
Bravenewbies,3dvuda,curiousstranger,2,Tue Jul 21 14:21:56 2015 UTC,"Also, the fact that contracts are expiring is simply a matter of load, not the pricing.

Bravenewbies,3dvuda,srguapo,3,Mon Jul 20 00:08:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, stacmon-aunsou route is really short (2ly iirc), so the price is super low. We'll have to see if it makes sense or not going forward."

Bravenewbies,3dsobo,NegativeLight,9,Sun Jul 19 02:31:38 2015 UTC,I was inactive for about two weeks due to real life issues.
Bravenewbies,3dsobo,Fl1pzomg,6,Sun Jul 19 02:37:39 2015 UTC,Wait two weeks and you got purged...and then they did not let you back in? That seems....well I guess Extrems is running a tight ship.

Bravenewbies,3dsobo,Redskylight,0,Sun Jul 19 03:42:05 2015 UTC,"If you haven't been a part of the operation lately, which I assume you haven't, yes. It's a tight ship.   In this case however, OP was removed right in the middle of an overhaul to the FC system. Sorry he was a product of some trimming of fat, but it's how it goes.   So he comes into the reddit and complains, but he needs to understand that you don't need all those flashy tools to be an FC. A lot of the fleets I see pinged aren't reimbursable. It's just the way it goes, and yet he's complaining about not being able to SRP. Then he gets salty about not being able to ping, but he doesn't need that. If pings were needed, there were ways for him to get them. He demanded pinging rights and was salty when he didn't get them.   It sounds like the case of Nathan who stormed out when things didn't go his way, and it comes down again to maturity.   Edit: holy shit I has no flair. Rip."

Bravenewbies,3dsobo,atomdeathstroke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:03:47 2015 UTC,"For real? You read this post and all you get is that I'm whining? Dude, get some perspective. I left, I said why, I said goodbye to my internet spaceship friends. Jesus.   It sounds like the case of Nathan who stormed out when things didn't go his way, and it comes down again to maturity.   The difference, which I can say now that I'm not in Brave, is that I'm not the type of asshole who leaves a fleet I'm FC'ing in the middle of a battle because I'm losing (despite equivalent-hull numerical superiority). I think all three of the other FCs who were there for that clusterfuck have also left Brave by now (I don't think Avaren was there, but I could be wrong), but believe me, taking over a fleet in the middle of a fight with BL because your FC called everyone ""fucking noob pieces of shit,"" blamed everything on incompetent logi, and ragequit partway through is a special kind of fun.  I showed up, I FC'd every chance I got, I did everything possible to create content for the line members, and eventually I decided I'd be happier elsewhere for a number of reasons (please note that this is a decision shared by the vast majority of our competent FCs over the last year, and consider that maybe there's a reason for that; it's not a conspiracy, I promise).   He demanded pinging rights and was salty when he didn't get them.   No I didn't, and you wouldn't know, because you weren't in the conversation, you ass. I pointed out that it was going to be hard to be as active as I used to without the ability to ping, SRP, or use command comms. I didn't demand shit. I didn't even threaten to leave if I didn't get my way, because I'm not a child. I decided I wasn't happy and left. Grow up.  Oh, and by the way, Brave is full of people who won't risk losing a 4 mil frig without SRP. I get that the people who've never stepped up and run fleets don't have any fucking clue what it's like, but at least recognize that you're ignorant."

Bravenewbies,3dn3js,deckmanx,2,Sat Jul 18 03:22:54 2015 UTC,"X'ai is good with the After Effects, but all of my videos are edited completely in Premiere with some Photoshop where needed. Premiere is really powerful but struggles with generating the more complex/fluid animations and effects that After Effects offers.  For example, X'ai made the Dropbears Logo animation in After Effects for me and I made the first on-screen animation with some photoshopped ship cutouts, screenshots, and a base wallpaper image I found online. So it just depends on what kind of intro you're looking to make and playing to either program's strengths."

Bravenewbies,3dmv8h,Luberino_Brochacho,7,Fri Jul 17 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"A blockade runner is magic in highsec and lowsec; though there's always the slim possibility that someone on a gate will be too close to you to cloak, while someone else there wants to kill you.   The Alliance also has hauling services, though there is a fee for their efforts, which will cut into your potential profits as a marketeer.   You can also use third party haulers like Red Frog to move your goods in highsec; or have a highsec hauling alt that hands the goods over to your BRAVE character.  For example I use a NPC corp character of mine to haul goods to a highsec station near to where BRAVE lives, and then use my main(in a blockade runner) to bring the goodies into lowsec.  This works both ways when hauling out space-loot.  Also remember to set up insta-warps and insta-docks at the stations your haulers regularly dock at.  You don't want to be lingering in one place too long."
Bravenewbies,3dmv8h,OtakuCarnival,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"Then apply with your main!  Edit: To actually answer your question, much of the market seeding is done through alts who are out of Brave.  Wardecs are a concern, and being in Brave basically means that high sec is very dangerous country indeed for doing logistics/hauling."
Bravenewbies,3dmv8h,unintentional_irony,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:47:37 2015 UTC,I would love to but my main is in a corp that I love. How do those out of corp alts get through then. Won't they get shot by Brave players and neuts alike?
Bravenewbies,3dmv8h,argon435,3,Fri Jul 17 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"Seeding the market is usually done by buying things in market hubs (usually on an alt, but if you have a jump clone I guess you could do it w/ brave character). Freight services such as Red Frog, PushX or public contracts are used to move the goods to Stacmon, and from there BLT moves it to home.  This way, the goods are always collateralized, and the risk of me losing ISK on the freighting is near zero (although sometimes moving the goods takes a little bit of time).   It sounds very confusing, but I was pleasantly surprised when I started importing a few months ago at how easy it is."
Bravenewbies,3dmv8h,unintentional_irony,2,Fri Jul 17 15:57:09 2015 UTC,"General rule is not to aggress neut jump freighters on the undock. Otherwise, a blockade runner should be able to get you anywhere you need to go relatively safely."
Bravenewbies,3dmv8h,AppleBytes,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:55:59 2015 UTC,Join Brave with a fresh PvP alt.... Ideally from a 2nd account. Right now CCP is giving 6mo of game time for three PLEX when creating new accounts.

Bravenewbies,3dmv8h,atomdeathstroke,0,Sat Jul 18 04:16:02 2015 UTC,"You can still do trading, and train up a blockade runner to avoid 99% of the WTs.  You can also contract your goodies out to have them hauled to where you need them.  It will decrease your margins, but think of all the dank isk you can make by selling in volume to a very large alliance."

Bravenewbies,3dop3m,scruffynerf,2,Sat Jul 18 01:30:25 2015 UTC,"Just looking at the timer board we look to be moving outwards from Ans pretty quickly. I would base it more on what planets are profitable / not crowded vs how much hauling you are willing to do on those slaves.  I assume since you have PI zombies you know the basics, but produce low end stuff in our space then sell it in jita/amarr. Extraction gets better and better (economic advantage) in lower sec standing systems, so it's more profitable to extract and ship to hs then factory planet it."
Bravenewbies,3dop3m,ithicaBuelle,2,Sat Jul 18 02:29:41 2015 UTC,make sure that your planet of choice is as small as possible. Get yourself in a travel fit ship and explore the region. Take a look at the planets and of course at the taxrate of the poco. If you click on Info on the pocos it will show you the current tax rate.

Bravenewbies,3do20z,Bronopoly,3,Fri Jul 17 21:55:35 2015 UTC,80% is awfully high. I'd go with a conservative 78%.

Bravenewbies,3do20z,X_D,2,Fri Jul 17 22:50:44 2015 UTC,"Closer to 40-50%, and if people with BRAVE alts counter, maybe 10%."
Bravenewbies,3do20z,Frekavichk,4,Sat Jul 18 01:21:22 2015 UTC,I'm having a ton of fun fishing a bunch of idiots (aka: TEST members) and killing their ratting carriers that have their life possessions in it. So I'd say my fun per hour is pretty high.
Bravenewbies,3do20z,SouporBonBon,5,Sat Jul 18 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"Real answer:  Pretty meh. With nancy gone for a bit and no leadership on, it feels like we don't actually have anything to do but take out moa fleets (pls let the moa die) and do arranged fights sometimes.  We have no goal and that is kind of putting a damper on my fun. I'd like to see a 'lets get all poses in this constellation down' or 'lets go harass someone in null' or some type of stratop that we can take out the big guns and do something productive."
Bravenewbies,3do20z,Frekavichk,2,Fri Jul 17 23:09:11 2015 UTC,"AFAIK we have two goals right now:   Become financially independent, on an individual level. Figure out a way to make isk reliably. This is explicitly a goal from Nancy, and it makes sense: the more $$$ our members have, the more freedom we have to undock the big guns without worrying about the SRP bank. If you have 1) accomplished, start figuring out what sort of content you want to create (sounds like you've got that started) and get the ball rolling. Talk to some FC's about putting together a ""get the moons"" or ""sov harass"" sig, if they're already in the works, figure out how you can get involved. Get involved in a department that makes shit happen - recon, logistics, etc. Don't just sit around complaining that there's no tengu timers!"
Bravenewbies,3do20z,Callduron,3,Fri Jul 17 23:19:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty much stable financially on alts.  And I'm looking to start scanning down more holes for stahp fleets, but I wish we had an alliance direction that isn't 'make your own damn content'."
Bravenewbies,3do20z,mcmasterstb,2,Fri Jul 17 23:32:26 2015 UTC,Alliance content is basically built off the back of fleet content. For instance I've been running inty gangs hunting nullsec ratters. I get about 12 people. If I were getting 100 people then I'd push the playstyle to mildirs and the other FCs and we could maybe ramp it up and be sending inty/faf fleets out all day run by lots of different FCs.  But I only get 12 people  so I'm not going to push it as something really cool that lots of people are interested in. Clearly it's a bit of a niche or at least something that needs more time to build up interest.  Maybe people just need a little time to recover from burnout etc but the alliance direction is likely to be influenced by what fleets people are choosing to join. At the moment FCs are offering a range of different content styles so fleet up and make the playstyle you like a success.  I also have something planned involving Cormorants that isn't like anything else we're doing so have a Corm or Maulus ready. Oh and bring a bucket for all the salty salty tears.
Bravenewbies,3do20z,SouporBonBon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:46:26 2015 UTC,I wanna do that too!
Bravenewbies,3do20z,Frekavichk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:41:33 2015 UTC,"Well the other alternative is to hang out and wait for some of the SIGs to get up and running. I know it doesn't look like it when you're sitting in station ship spinning, but the alliance direction right now is ""get moved in,"" and a lot of that is still happening. The choice between ""make your own damn content"" or ""sit tight and give other people a chance to make content for you"" doesn't seem too bad to me v0v"
Bravenewbies,3do20z,jasharanylund,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:43:37 2015 UTC,Yea. I just hope SIGs are not the whole of brave's end game. I want something to try and achieve as an alliance.
Bravenewbies,3do20z,atomdeathstroke,2,Sat Jul 18 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"I am absolutely positive that you are welcome to take out a POCO bash or some such other Alliance stratop fleet, if that is your thing. Making your own content basically means, if what is going on isn't what you want to do, you are empowered to go do that thing. Check with Cornak and/or Extrems if you need to know what needs killing and check with a Dojo officer like Ahoda if you need to ping for more pilots. Just about everyone can fit up a Burnination dessie, there might even be enough on the local market.   Beyond taking POCOs and Moons, I don't expect a lot of stratop fleets here in the near future. We just don't have timers the way we did in sov. Many of us are feeling pretty relieved about that. If you're hoping for Alliance-level sov objectives...well, it's probably going to be awhile."
Bravenewbies,3do20z,Frekavichk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:04:01 2015 UTC,Please check with an FC or diplo for a poco or moon that is on the bash list please refrain from starting incidents please and thank you  Yomato slayer Brave diplo
Bravenewbies,3do20z,Callduron,2,Sun Jul 19 15:16:45 2015 UTC,We have been harassing our neighbors almost every night! Did you miss our fleets?
Bravenewbies,3do20z,TangoWhiskeyjack,2,Fri Jul 17 23:32:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that doesn't have a purpose or reason.  It is just random fleets to go fuck around, which is fun sometimes. I personally just like some type of structure."
Bravenewbies,3do20z,X_D,2,Fri Jul 17 23:50:03 2015 UTC,We need more numbers before we get too aggressive with structures. The kind of subcap dominance that makes people like Snuff think twice before dropping dreads.  However there are poco bashes going out which is a start.
Bravenewbies,3do20z,noirpied,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:51:58 2015 UTC,One of the biggest factors in me deciding to leave BNI was the fleet comp. Seriously the moa is boring and it's all that was flown. Next was afk leadership.

In a month or two I'll go pick it up when it's all dead.   What could be changed?    Stuff. And things.   Any suggestions srsly i want to know    Join fleets. Especially mine :)   and hear from the masses that is most PL and TEST....   tbh I think most of those guys have lost interest in us (except for some heroes downthread).   maybe one uni bro   Maybe.   or maybe your a tinkerhell alt.

Bravenewbies,3diu44,LogicSauce,2,Fri Jul 17 09:19:02 2015 UTC,Indeed. The biggest loss with Bovril leaving is their perma-fleet setup with combined mining and PvP. I'd like us to get back to that situation (in time).

Ppl join brave and when they mention wanting to mine or industry, they are told to join bovril or brovil.  Now that bovril moved on, this is a reminder that the more laid back less fanatical brovil is still here with us.  And they are bro's. I used to have a mining alt in bovril and left them when the ""blood for the blood god"" role playing crap started.  Mining with brave provisions was more productive for me cause they don't draw attention to themselves with the blood miners rhetoric."
Bravenewbies,3diu44,AppleBytes,2,Thu Jul 16 17:24:22 2015 UTC,This was posted before it was cleared up that BROVI are still in Brave.  I am 99.999999999% certain that /u/mitnik- thought this was No Refunds trying to poach.
Bravenewbies,3diu44,NoMiT,-12,Thu Jul 16 17:33:08 2015 UTC,Implying this sub belongs to BNI and not the alliance as a whole.  Nevermind the fact that BNI is basically just a big feeder corp anyway.
Bravenewbies,3diu44,John_Smith3,9,Thu Jul 16 17:14:23 2015 UTC,Its attitudes like that that have hurt Brave so much.  BRAVE is BNI. Its about supporting those adorable Newbies.
Bravenewbies,3diu44,AppleBytes,-4,Thu Jul 16 17:30:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and you should support them by pointing them to specialized corps after being in BNI for a few months. Newbros can't grow if they don't specialize.  Give them a few months to find a career, transfer them to a alliance corp that will refine their existing aptitude and allow them to be an asset to the alliance rather than making them be a ""newbro"" forever."
Bravenewbies,3diu44,Bap1811,4,Thu Jul 16 17:38:51 2015 UTC,They can specialize wherever they want to. In brave or outside of it.   But when BRAVE becomes a 'feeder corp' where we train the basics and point them at other corps to fuel those corps self interests then BRAVE isn't about the newbies any more.   It then becomes about those 'specialist' corps having a flood of newbies to power their own interest. And thats not BRAVE.
Bravenewbies,3diu44,Bap1811,3,Thu Jul 16 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"This is the lesson that Brave just refuses to learn.  Imagine for a moment you need to build a house, but only the people in your family can work on it.  Do you...  A. Have only 4-5 people out of the family do all the work, while the rest goof-off and reap the benefits? B. Let ""everyone help"". (Little bro Timmy with a nailgun) Or C.  Divide labor based on their skills, while keeping the kids out of the way?    I'm not saying newbies are useless.... not by far.  But they must be nurtured, trained, and guided to be the best they can be... not just dumped into a single homogenized bin of bland tapioca.    .... I think I'm mixing my metaphors.  But hopefully my point is clear.  Brave SHOULD be a feeder corp.  The trick is feeding them into strong, and loyal sister corps so they don't get poached later-on by PL,BL,Test, or whomever is farming us at the time."

I'm honestly new at battleships (did a couple neuting BS gangs to gank dreads) but I've got to learn somehow.

Bravenewbies,3dihn3,Callduron,5,Thu Jul 16 17:09:59 2015 UTC,"It's not about blue fucking. It's about making isk.  Isk has no allies only enemies. If you don't want any drama, don't share your alts identity to anyone ever.  Only thing you will do is create drama and piss people off.  Also, telling them to blue fuck vs what I actually said which was, ""you can and it's a dick move"" are very different. To add to that, you can do the same thing to an enemy too.  Get an alt in their corp, find their doctrine shit, and when they need to reship, purchase X module, you can apply the same method and ""red fuck"".

Here is a setup we have used previously: Prospect Hunting!  But if you want isk efficient cynos, grab an alt with regular cyno fit up a dual tank stabber or vexor and away you go baiting and hunting. you can get a great Vexor with regular cyno for 10m or less! then try to at least kill targets 5 x your worth!

Bravenewbies,3deynb,atomdeathstroke,2,Wed Jul 15 23:40:55 2015 UTC,Cap stability is like 100% not needed and not even possible for standard fit t2 logi.  You should have ~1-2 minutes of cap generally and you are pretty decent.
Bravenewbies,3deynb,Frekavichk,0,Wed Jul 15 23:45:05 2015 UTC,we aren't talking about T2 logi.  I wouldn't fit an Oneiros like this.

Bravenewbies,3deynb,Frekavichk,3,Thu Jul 16 04:34:15 2015 UTC,"I think this is very situational. When the DPS/Logi ratio is high, logi has to pump out every single bit of rep as long as possible. Being cap stable is definitely preferred in this case. However, in most of the Brave fleets (maybe not the recent ones), our DPS/Logi ratio is like 3:1 or even 2:1. Being cap stable on fitting window isn't that important, because you only need one or two reppers to sustain the incoming damage. The more important thing should be landing the initial rep and preventing ship being alpha'd.  That's just my understanding."
Bravenewbies,3deynb,aicey1983,0,Thu Jul 16 04:56:18 2015 UTC,"In those fleets yes, which is why a sebo is so important.  The extra 100+ scan res will literally make a life or death difference."

Bravenewbies,3deynb,atomdeathstroke,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:03:42 2015 UTC,"I want to ask how do you deal with the opportunity cost when running all your repper 99% of the time when you have to switch your reppers on another target as quick as possible?   I find that in a LARGE (80-200 people) fleet, having spare reppers is a good way to prevent target being alphaed. Of course you can cycle your reppers when locking people up, but because of the server tick, you can't always cycle reppers before locked up broadcasting target. Also, I found no reason to constantly repping people when you are clearly over repping.   I think your play style/fit is different from flying in large blob fleet. Losing one logi is way more damaging in small gang, hence you fit sebo and eccm. Less buffer does not matter that much either, because it's very unlikely logi died before reps landing."
Bravenewbies,3deynb,aicey1983,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:15:41 2015 UTC,"Despite what most people think, brave rarely blobs.  99% of the time I fly with brave it's fleets of around 30 players with 5-10 logi pilots.  If we are doing huge blob fleets, we usually do shield logi, which is an entirely different game.  As for reppers, you should be staggering reps if you have all three running and can enable/disable at least one while you are locking up a new target and start landing reps almost almost instantly."

Bravenewbies,3deynb,Tyri,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:41:56 2015 UTC,than you are a terrible logi pilot.   That's pretty strong don't you think? It's common to just pulse the third rep and build an exeq fit around be cap stable with everything but one rep on. More tank is more useful than trying some kind of gimp fit to get completely stable.
Bravenewbies,3deynb,TravisUchonela,0,Fri Jul 17 07:32:00 2015 UTC,"The fit isn't being built around being cap stable, it's about getting reps on your target fast and effectively. Sebo is needed, not getting jammed out is needed, and T2 reps are a minimum .5 seconds faster.  Being cap stable is helpful too.  Also, not everyone has perfect skills.  Cap booster will help those that don't have perfect logi and cap skills."
Bravenewbies,3deynb,atomdeathstroke,2,Thu Jul 16 16:45:52 2015 UTC,Your fit isn't terrible but you give up a lot of tank for a little extra repping power and cap stability. I think you'll probably come around if you end up running these but NBD. But I disagree with the idea that not permarunning your third rep makes the dude a bad logi pilot; low sec fights with brawling cruisers just aren't touch and go for hours on end. If you're burning three reps for more than three minutes straight you're probably getting dunked anyway.
Bravenewbies,3deynb,TravisUchonela,0,Thu Jul 16 16:51:34 2015 UTC,":)  So since you obviously have no clue I will explain to you how fleet mid - large scale fights usually work out:   Enemy Targets a Primary The Primary Broadcasts for shields, ideally when he sees the yellow boxes Logi starts locking him up while damage starts applying. Either you safe him in the first 2-3 cycles, or the target dies. If he is holding reps the enemy will switch to another target because there is no reason to shoot the old one while all the logi is cycling on him. You want to turn off reppers now to be ready to react to the next broadcast.   In the above scenario you are running all your reps maybe 40% of the time.  If you want I can explain logi to you more in depth."
Bravenewbies,3deynb,Tyri,3,Thu Jul 16 17:16:12 2015 UTC,"Uh, just sayin, but the one that the OP linked is what you should use, yours is bad m8   those hammerheads may shoot you as well, since trying to control DPS drones and be logi is difficult   That's not how drones work, if you have them set to aggressive (which you shouldn't as logi), they will only shoot people who are agressing you. Also, it's not hard, when we ran our exeq fleets against you guys in fountain we were doing logi, dps and tackle all at the same time and it worked just fine."

Bravenewbies,3deynb,leroydfz,0,Wed Jul 15 20:28:49 2015 UTC,"Not as quickly as you think, with other people flying this fit and people using watch lists, the reps land really quickly and hold well especially if you stagger them.

Bravenewbies,3deynb,om_rootingking,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:39:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a lot of those fits are going to require really good fitting skills, including AWU5...  Somebody needs to pay attention to the Newbies part of ""Brave Newbies"""
Bravenewbies,3deynb,klaxce,2,Wed Jul 15 19:53:03 2015 UTC,"Encouraging newbros to max their core fitting skills ASAP is doing them a better favor than modifying fits to low SP.  They can always meta 4 the mods and faction the ammo to take part while they train, they can always ask in dojo for fitting help. Core skills at v unlocks so much it's just plain abusive to tell people they only need those skills at iv for now."
Bravenewbies,3deynb,om_rootingking,2,Wed Jul 15 22:51:43 2015 UTC,"AWU5 isn't a newbro skill.  The second part, is have you ever been in dojo trying to help people modify the retarded ass fits people have been told to fly? It isn't easy. In most cases it boils down to the player buying or being given multiple mods over and over trying to refit the ship. New players don't know about, or how to use, EFT/Pyfa. Often they aren't familiar with dragging their fit into chat, or understanding how much PG/CPU/Calibration they're maxed out on. Having fits that assume a realistic player makes their lives easier, and makes it easier to get these people out flying.  Now I understand some of these fits have T2 guns, so you might expect the player to not be a week old newbro, but it still doesn't mean they are all going to be familiar and comfortable adjusting the fit.  Also, some poor FC is going to have a harder time when people have gimped the weapon size, or a myriad of other tweaks that ""don't seem like a big deal"", but mean that the fight doesn't play out as expected because people aren't in known fits.  At the end of the day, why not just fly good, pilot accessible fits?  Ps- why does Brave insist on re-inventing the wheel every time? Just use the good fits that already exist instead of this scrapheap..."
Bravenewbies,3deynb,GeorgeTheGeorge,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:34:47 2015 UTC,"AWU5 is the last of the core skills i trained, i wish someone had been there to impress upon me how easy eve gets after the core skills are maxed.  6 years in, i still don't use eft or pyfa.  Nobody is going to need to gimp weapon size on a fit, and competence requires you ask people to put their range/dps/whatever stat in fleet channel so you know what you're working with.  You want to make eve easier now based on not training core skills, when maxing them would make eve easier forever after. I have seen nullsec pvp mildirs who have fits with 3% implants in them purely because they never trained their core skills past IV. Those people are called bad.   I'm no leetist but we're meant to be 'lol new and give no fux' or just plain 'give no fux' but there are those pilots who are 'i'm crap and won't be told'.....nobody wants to be that guy."

Bravenewbies,3dddh0,Callduron,8,Wed Jul 15 11:41:42 2015 UTC,"I'd like to announce a few open spots on Brave's Alliance Tournament squad.  The Alliance Tournament is a prestigious pvp event which will take place on three weekends starting (for us) at 15.00 Eve on August 15th.  Squad members are required to attend a minimum of 1 practice per fortnight, although if you want to be a strong contender for selection you should aim for at least 2 practices a week. We practice at 18.00 Sat, Sun, Tues, Thurs and again for the US timezone 8 hours later (2.00 Eve of the following calendar day).  Playing with the AT Squad has been a wonderful experience and has really improved us as players. The team is coming together as an effective unit and we are doing really well in arranged practice events against other AT contenders.  We're a month away from the main event and it's feeling like Christmas, so exciting. This will almost certainly be your last chance to be involved this year.  To be eligible you must have been a member of Brave Collective on May 15th and to have not left the alliance. Likewise if you leave the alliance before the AT there's no point applying for this.  If you want to be considered send an Eve mail to Callduron titled AT Squad. I will be interviewing candidates on Mumble over the next few days. Cut off date for mailing me is Sunday 19th July."

The easiest thing to fly is an ewar frigate as these often have no tank modules or guns (maybe a Damage Control 2).  I would want relevant Navigation and Engineering skills to IV, the racial frigate to V and the ewar type to IV for the initial skill then IV/V for the one that adds 5% strength per point.  For shooty ships I want T2 weapons with specialisation to IV.  In some cases we won't quite have the skill points so I may field players with less.

Bravenewbies,3dcwpb,Frekavichk,5,Wed Jul 15 13:03:52 2015 UTC,"Aldent was personally and solely responsible for a TEST freighter being destroyed by valiant BO-LD pilots on the Keberz gate in HED-GP. Since that day he has done absolutely nothing in EvE except struggle with the paradox of contempt: if the people you spend all your time hazing are terrible, what does that make you?   As an incurable wart on the undocks of Defsunun, YZ and now Aunsou, Aldent has cemented himself as the village-idiot-for-life.  Or maybe he got stood up by a pretty girl and only logs on to EvE to pew pixels in the vain hope of getting some self-esteem back, i don't know."
Bravenewbies,3dcwpb,om_rootingking,2,Thu Jul 16 02:07:24 2015 UTC,reconndite seems to be at about that same level with bovril. though he's more creepy instead of vitriolic.

Bravenewbies,3dcwpb,gentlemangin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:24:51 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's pretty obviously an Aldent alt, so banning him once might have slowed down his shit posting a bit, but hasn't stopped it, and has in reality just caused a bit of confusion on this thread.  But yeah, he's not getting unbanned, and this alt is probably already banned."

An alt? And also, I'm not the one who expressed concern. I understand this was a mostly joke post. I just wanted Aldent (who I have personally salted against in local chat within the last 3 days) to know he's is still a human being who will find a listening ear if he ever needs to broadcast for reps, even though I don't get along with him normally.  Fuck internet spaceships, I care about the people more.  Edit: Maybe you are Aldent, and I just assumed that /u/AldentArkanon was the real Aldent."
Bravenewbies,3dcwpb,coffeerocks,9,Wed Jul 15 09:45:59 2015 UTC,"I think it has to do with the unceasing frequency and incredibly hostile tone that Aldent takes, to be frank. I kid around in local too, however, even I have expressed concerns for his well-being to a couple others.  Picking on one another is all in good sport. ""TEST is dumpster"", ""-A- is shit, ""Brave is dying"" - its all of us poking fun at the other. And that's totally cool! But when someone does it with an absolute passion like Aldent does, it makes others kinda go ""whoa, what's going on with this dude?"", yknow?  Edit: just wanted to add that the above was sincere, but felt the need to add ""LOL, Test"" also.   P.S. Barve is recruiting!"

Bravenewbies,3dcwpb,leroydfz,7,Wed Jul 15 20:13:46 2015 UTC,"Nah. This isn't whining. This is schadenfreude. Brave have dealt with minas, gorski, elise, all of PL - a single idiot who manages to actually lose svipuls in the process of trying to be leet pvp and snipe some t1 frigs doesn't even get a spot on the very bottom of the leaderboard.

Minas used to undock his carrier and solo everything not capital sized   I would gladly bring my carrier over to placid if I could, but back when Minas did that it was before phoebe, not to mention the risk of getting hot dropped on the undock, as brave were yesterday with around 15 blops BS.   All I can say is that everyone thinks you're a retard.   Thanks for your opinion, I don't know how you can possibly think that you speak for EVERYONE. It would seem to me that you are the retard here, friend. The fact that you are so enraged by what someone on the Internet says indicates that you probably have some anger management issues and might benefit from professional medical attention.   but brave of all people   Obviously brave would dislike someone who constantly gives them trouble, that is only logical. It would be far more concerning if they liked someone who constantly made their time in the game more difficult, and the fact that you seem to advocate such a mindset truly brings about some concerns. That said, I guess there's really no chance of helping you."

Just using the reddits as a metric here, and no, getting downvoted whenever you post a comment doesn't mean you're right, it means you're probably missing the mark by more than  a few miles   Obviously brave would dislike someone who constantly gives them trouble, that is only logical.   Nah, brave think you're shit  Have you noticed how brave have loved and adored every single successful farmer in that weird stockholm syndrome kind of way? Well, they think you're shit. They actively make fun of you. As if that wasn't telling enough. But man, you're really beyond helping.

EDIT - if in doubt look for a CAMRA sign. That usually means well kept beer at the very least. They list most major pubs with rankings on whatbeer.com with maps and directions for when you're drunk.

New Cross (South London) has some really great pubs, the hobgoblin, the new cross house and the Marquis of Granby.     The Black Friar, right outside of blackfriars station is also pretty good, I go there after work most fridays.  I've never been to the university hospital area, but you're close to basically everywhere in London with the tube system, the Leicester Square/Covent Garden area is also good for pubs, again kinda expensive but they have good atmospheres and stuff.   Shoreditch has many good pubs my boss tells me, but I don't really go there myself.   Uhh basically you can throw a rock and hit like 5 pubs in London.

Bravenewbies,3dac8n,drokmo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:05:31 2015 UTC,Depending on where in London you go for drinks (& where you are used to drinking back home) be prepared for expensive drinks. I used to date a girl who lived across from the Sherlock Holmes (near Trafalgar Square) & you would be lucky to get a pint of anything for under £4 there.

Bravenewbies,3d8ul2,m_sibelius,10,Tue Jul 14 14:40:12 2015 UTC,"The move, the new direction really hurt us with 4 corps deciding to leave. I also feel that the game simply became more work than a lot of people could sustain between the relentless strat ops and the chore of moving.  But sometimes you have to take a step backwards in order to find again your path forward.  We now have a clear sustainable direction that is positive and fun.  FCs are having a blast. I took out under 150m of ships the other night and killed 1.5b without losing an atron. We killed Boodabooda last night while he was ratting. I gloriously suicided a handful of hero frigates onto a linked elite pvp Orthrus and gave him a heart attack as he had to nuke his way out of multiple webs and scrams - next time we'll pull him down with us.  A short while ago Arik pinged a fleet; yesterday Lumpy pinged for Pocket Rockets. Real nostalgia for old time Brave Newbies. It would be great to see a bunch of the old guard return/reactivate.  Numbers are down, wounds are being licked, people are taking breaks but Brave is once again a delight to fly with.  Nancy has made a great start as leader.  My only real misgiving is line member income. While there are certain possibilities I think too many people are hanging around our station broke and not really enthused by any of the options. Hopefully dojo and the veterans can get people past that as we become more settled.  With Fozziesov nullsec is burning and we would have been top of the bonfire. We really dodged a bullet there, this could have been a month of extreme pain."

As for the 26mil Thrashers, well... they're actually reasonably priced for what you get.  I viewed one of the 28mil Thrasher contracts and put it through Evepraisal. Here's what I got. Note that each 'Scout' artillery gun costs 2mil ISK apiece at Jita, bringing the total Jita sell price to 20mil ISK. Not only that, but it's a contract from a third party, so we really can't do anything about that aside from have our marketers undercut them.  On the plus side, the hull market currently seems pretty decent, at least on the hull side. Hopefully on the module side as well. Should (depending on the markets' whims) be easy to build one yourself for cheaper than a contract."

They were always an interesting mix of new bro PvP/PvE that was exploited madly by their leadership for dank tax ISK and bodies, and the expiriment continues in a new area. We will see if they can adapt, but if you actually care make friends with them and then toss them a life line when they realize how butt fucked they are getting.  But realize, for some of them this is exactly what they want. Easy content with a powerful big brother and infinite PvE.

We offered you a station + system in immensa XS it would have been all yours to rat mine and base out of. You could have made bank off the taxes from the station and the station/system would have had Bovrils Name on it for everyone to see. We even offered to pay for all upgrades and structures including a multiple Death start and dick star POS's. I offered free JF logistics to move all your stuff out there and the alliance was going to start a SRP program for you. I cant believe you took razors offer over ours. Well good luck with razor hope you have fun I know we are.

Bravenewbies,3dc7fa,Rnadmo,2,Wed Jul 15 04:08:07 2015 UTC,Why would you think that sending someone all your isk was a good idea?
Bravenewbies,3dc7fa,mylastbreath,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:38:58 2015 UTC,Because the sell a plex and send isk (rather than receive isk) scam is well known (to vets) and works when people don't notice they are giving isk rather than receiving it.     Similar argument applies to the billions for millions scam - where you pay 1000x the advertised price.
Bravenewbies,3dc7fa,Chie_Okanata,2,Wed Jul 15 04:52:49 2015 UTC,"If someone on the street asked you to give all your money and he'll double it for you, would you do it? No? Common sense, right? Why would the same thing in a game be any different?  OP didn't actually say what scam he fell for but he did mention local chat in a comment so I'm guessing it was isk doubling."
Bravenewbies,3dc7fa,mylastbreath,2,Wed Jul 15 18:11:03 2015 UTC,"Really sorry to hear that you were scammed, if you are in need of a frigate or two ship to blow up let me know and I will send you a couple.  I see that some are saying that you fucked up, or should have known better, but this is not very helpful after the event.  EVE is not like any other MMO I have ever played or likely to.  Please don’t trust anything that looks too good to be true, especially if you are seeing this “fantastic offer” in local chat when you are in the main trading hubs – Amarr, Jita etc. Just ignore them completely and life will be sweeter.  EVE has a fair number of scammers and gankers, also the occasional very creepy sociopath. But contrary to popular myth, most players are decent people who will be happy to help you with advice, but equally happy to blow you up should the opportunity arise.  If you are in Brave, hang out in Brave Dojo, ask questions, get advice and learn to regard most of your space ships as ammunition :)  If you are not in Brave then join up."
Bravenewbies,3dc7fa,Nonnie_Sarvesh,2,Wed Jul 15 11:35:19 2015 UTC,Sounds like you fell for an ISK doubling scam.  They probably linked you a website that shows wallet transactions to proove it is a legit ISK doubling service.

I even got a mail saying that they help out new players! ""click on this, click on that..."".  When you new to something you see it completely differently. I still don't know what the majority of the buttons do exactly..    The reactions in this thread are interesting by the way.

Bravenewbies,3dc7fa,Barandis,3,Wed Jul 15 16:33:25 2015 UTC,"It's not that weird, remembering that in most games, what happened would be at least discouraged and at most a bannable offense. I knew this was a sandbox when I started, but that certainly didn't mean I had any experience with what a sandbox really means.  Anyway, OP, take it as the price of learning. I hope your cost was less than the 2 billion that my lesson cost me.  It seems like it sucks when you're new, but you'll get over that very soon. In the meantime, send me an evemail if you could use some help. I mean, if you're not scamming."

I have few eve friends that makes their ingame living from scamming and it seems to work very well for them.  It's one way versus many others.

If you have several ideas about scamming newbies, then feel free to use them; however majority of the scammers focus on veterans. Why? Because veterans tears are much more salty. Some scammers that were trying to scam my low age alts were actually nice and at the end they gave me money to grow up faster (so they can rob me later, heh).

Sometimes paying (somewhat) attention to the game and grinding red crosses sucks, but dying when you really shouldn't have sucks worse."

Bravenewbies,3d4f87,saminskip,21,Mon Jul 13 13:02:55 2015 UTC,"AAR  I'm Loki, BAER FC and one of the coordinators for this defense.  Around 36 hours ago I as contacted by DAM directors asking for assistance. DURA LEXX, a roving Russian corp had moved a large capital fleet, supported by faction battleships into their home. K-7, a C6-C5 was quickly reinforced and locked down.  Initially, I rushed down solo to assist DAM in wresting hole control. We engaged the Russians on their POS with limited DAM/BAER numbers and tried to keep them locked in while we scanned for reinforces.  http://puu.sh/iW369/b1574ef709.jpg  Unfortunately, we failed. DURA took hole control and continued to reinforce their numbers throughout the night.  https://zkillboard.com/kill/47811455/ https://zkillboard.com/kill/47811463/  I podded myself out, vowing to return with BAERS in force. With 4 hours before the final defensive timer, I rallied 15 or so dedicated BAERS with friendly capitals on standby and began rolling for K7.  Two holes in.  https://zkillboard.com/kill/47814034/  This continued for about 6 hours, and we rolled an estimated 40 holes before DAM frantically contacted me, saying they'd managed to grab hole control back and we had an in. Luckily Nova was rather close and we started the 11 jumps in armor T3s, knowing we'd be without heavy assets if we managed to gain entrance.  Unfortunatly, DURA LEXX is quite capable and DAM lost hole control about 3 jumps out. BAERS begrudging turned around headed to Nova. I stood the fleet down just as Mira, our EU FC arrived and vowed to continue.  He ragerolled an estimated 30 times before standing down himself, and we vowed to continue come the next round of defensive timers. Morale was low and DAM forces were on edge, keen to take the fight to the Russians.  In the meantime, COF had begun rolling their static and by the will of Bob, rolled in an hour or two before the timers. The call quickly went out, I awoke to many pings. COF had engaged DURA LEXX for control of the wormhole, while calling BAER/DO forces to race down the chain. DAM, eager by this time to engage dropped the full force of their caps on the Russians. With equal cap numbers, and a large BRAVE armor T3 fleet standing off against faction battleships, triage and dreadnaughts, the fight of K7 and the second last english speaking C6 corporation was on.  With myself on the sidelines in intel, COF FC IRDJ commanded subcaps, while friendly caps were commanded by DAM FC Ghostmarine.  Capitals began dying quickly, and when the dust settled DURA LEXX dreadnaughts held the field, with DAM capitals quickly being put down by the blinged russian Dreadnaughts. However, the combined weight of the BRAVE/DAM subcaps managed to win the ground war, and a stalemate ensured as both sides attempted to bring reinforcements in. DURA caps remained held down on grid, unable to disengage but tanking the damage admirably until the capacitor war was finally won. The cheers on comms announced the first Russian tank breaking, and the remaining Russian forces quickly were neuted out by reinforcements and put down.  DAM holds the hole, and begins rebuilding. DURA LEXX evacuated their remaining forces just before downtime.  Huge congratulations to DAM for surviving the 3rd great eviction of the year.   Fantastic FC'ing from IRDJ and Cope Dogg.  Thanks to all BRAVE pilots who rallied."

Bravenewbies,3d4f87,Zanzha,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:31:54 2015 UTC,"Assuming the 955m budget of the above fit  Bricktank for the same price - http://pastebin.com/D0nFmNRw  DCU can be dropped for another gyro to increase dps, it isn't often needed as your ehp in armour is what matters when flying with triage and / or guardians due to the comparativley minimal buffer the hull on a t3 offers.  (so more often than not you will be running something like this http://pastebin.com/FqYfkTKR)  Carry refit for tracking computer / painter in the mid for when there is limited ecm on field. Has the benefit of being able to heat tank for an additional 42k (100k ehp vs a blap nag) Active hardeners aren't a problem on lokis, worst case scenario gets fed cap from a guardian, they typically aren't the target of heavy neuting especially when caps or proteii / other neuting subcaps (for defensive neuting) are on grid.  Regular ammo can be loaded for selectable damage and is still competitive with (ahead of) HAMs  Comparative speeds, however the mwd is able to accelerate faster allowing to close on targets when swaps are needed.  I just honestly don't think mixxed weapons are ever going to win over a single weapon system simply as lowslot damage mods aren't effecting your entire dps output. Application is down to the pilot, however the projection is somewhat lackluster, but it still remains a problem for the ham loki as it will have to drop ~120 dps from the autos not being in range, and still gets pulled down by its acs. If raw projection and range is a problem, swap subsystem out and run arties, you loose dps but gain alpha and projection.  Its not that I'm against the idea of a ham loki, but that it has to run mixxed weapons, it gains half the benefits of one system, and is still held back by limitation of the other.  oh and err. budget version:  http://pastebin.com/yDUhh3YG"
Bravenewbies,3d4f87,nikolai_stocks,3,Mon Jul 13 15:23:53 2015 UTC,You seem to think the loki is a pure dps boat. We have them because of their webs.  So if you are always within hail range of the primary you are not going to be able to web all the things you need to be webbing.  HAMS also don't miss. Cause ...... missiles. Damage wise that split weapon systems loki is going to apply damage better if you are flying a loki how you should fly a loki.
Bravenewbies,3d4f87,Newman0072,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:55:02 2015 UTC,"I fully understand that it isn't primarily dps boat, but they were talking about how they used the mixxed to provide more damage/application than the autos, my point was to say that you can get the same, if not more damage from autos whilst having a much larger tank to boot."

Our strategic objective in fountain was ""Not get turbodunked today"". That's not a goal people can get behind and we honestly couldn't field the members to stop it from happening.   Give this change of pace a chance or if low-sec is killing you there will hopefully be groups popping up to help you find content that is more to your liking and this particular pocket of low sec is adjacent to a lot of npc null and other active parts of space.

Such a fleet would have almost certainly been curb stomped by our neighbours in Fountain, let alone the fact that I, as an new FC would have been completely out of my element.  Now, in placid, we're a bit more evenly matched by our neighbours and fleets like that first fleet I ran are more viable.

It usually means ammo is on the market and then you just ask around if you're missing something and someone probably bought extras. We do have some very basic fits as part of our syndicate flight club that we plan on handing out. Nothing fancy but something definitely to undock in and get blown up.

If I'm running a fleet I'll talk you through hooking up with us or meet you halfway. Frigs going gate-to-gate are pretty safe in low sec unless it's a busy pipe. Ceptors are pretty safe anywhere.  There's some kerfuffle at the moment about SIGs. Apparently people aren't allowed to do a SIG without an appropriate managerial hierarchy, an official reporting stucture and a recognised audit process.  So there definitely isn't a Flight Club SIG and even if there were it wouldn't leave from 9GYL-O and roam all over the map fighting people. And even if it did, no one would talk about it."
Bravenewbies,3d51v7,Frekavichk,6,Mon Jul 13 18:43:14 2015 UTC,"Nah, the truth of it is that there's no real rules or guidelines about sigs yet and there's no officially endorsed sigs.

Jabber pings, channels, how to manage what's active and what isn't - or, alternatively, if we should just stay the fuck away and let them grow without our interference.

Bravenewbies,3d51v7,JFKen,4,Tue Jul 14 03:05:16 2015 UTC,"Callduron is being a bit hyperbolic of course. Since joining us he's been incredibly enthusiastic about creating content literally every single day, I haven't seen someone this excited to try stuff out in a long time. We're waiting for official rules now to know what needs to be done/if its worthwhile/if we're allowed to run an official sig for what we're doing.

Bravenewbies,3d3ot6,Yossie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:26:25 2015 UTC,"We're talking about a relatively low skill BCs with t1 logi support fighting a gang of approximatively the same size, but composed of faction battleships and a T2 logi support.  Altrue probably switched target to try to make few kills but logi were reactives.  I'm surprised by the lack of typhoons on ExF side."
Bravenewbies,3d3ot6,JoeTed,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:49:50 2015 UTC,What interests me is if they had been able to kill at least something if there was remote logi in game and would that make the game better.
Bravenewbies,3d3ot6,Yossie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:07:22 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of ways to disturb logi work. Alpha is the classical answser. The other classical way is to get enough DPS to melt repped targets. The race between reps, dps and alpha is actually interesting when you are involved in it. Losing it would be sad.  Neuts on logis or target (to switch off hardeners) is working also. Brave used massive ewar fleets. My feeling is that it's more enraging to fight against an ewar support fleet rather than a logi support fleet. Ask PL, they know about it for sure.  Managing a logi wing is also an interesting thing. The logi blob is usually separated from the dps blob and both wing need to work together. Just look at Altrue's first ""Heavy Fleet"" video against NC and observe FC's tactic with logi positionning.  To be able to have a good synergy with logis, big fleet fittings rely on different things than autonomous small gang ship. I like that kind of specialization.  Surely, removing remote reps would increase attrition even with overwhelming forces but on the over hand it would be reducing gameplay and tactical diversity."
Bravenewbies,3d3ot6,coleburn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:47:16 2015 UTC,"Sure, damage seems to be the classical way to deal with reps. That is why neither of these fleets had any ewar in them. We have dedicated logi wings that are mandatory for any fleet of significant size. Ewar not so much. Brave used massive ewar fleets because newbies with frigates at least of some use in ewar rather than in tackle frigate in sov null battles. Don't remember seeing our enemies use ewar in the similar size as they use logi.  Maybe the answer is not to remove things, maybe we should ask why ewar is not used as a counter to logi more? Why don't we have fleets with damage, ewar and logi wings but just damage and logi?"

Problem is that they cost about 80 mil per hull while the moas cost about 10. Also they require T2 logi to be run effectively and we couldn't run much of that back in Catch before we discontinued them in exchange for the moas.   Moas fly almost exactly like them with links, as they are slightly overpowered right now. The reason we'd be renewing them would be because of Armor T3's, making them a natural progression from  Maller -> ANI -> Zealot -> Legion  Kinda like how we did Moa -> Ealge -> Tengu"

Geddons work really well as support for fireflies if you're clever about it, but the options for them are really limited without a titan.

Bravenewbies,3d1rq7,applejacksparrow,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:47:10 2015 UTC,"Better projection. Void has higher raw damage, but if you're only a little out of range, it won't hit properly. As for the price, we're only carrying ~250 rounds, and you can't complain about 90k of ""expensive"" ammo when you're deliberately whelping 9 M worth of ship and mods..."

By default, Tripwire gives you a shared corporate mask and I believe it is possible to share that mask with all members of an alliance if the mask owner enables it and the ceo/director of each corp sheets it as an available corp mask."
Bravenewbies,3cwvke,Solomon_Phi,3,Sat Jul 11 14:02:36 2015 UTC,Can you guys talk in dojo?
Bravenewbies,3cwvke,mkc2020,2,Sat Jul 11 19:15:43 2015 UTC,Yes we can. EDIT: Originally we couldn't but it was one of the first channels to get back. So yay dojo!

Bravenewbies,3cwvke,applejacksparrow,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:19:58 2015 UTC,"Wait, so there was a time when PL and men. Could talk in dojo but our own FW corps couldnt?"
Bravenewbies,3cwvke,KiuNakamura,2,Sun Jul 12 15:58:57 2015 UTC,"No offense, but arent the two FW corps meant for alts? You shouldnt need access to any channels?"
Bravenewbies,3cwvke,ThomasMarkov,8,Sat Jul 11 14:09:48 2015 UTC,I'd expect many main characters to want a break from brave proper and have joined our FW corps.
Bravenewbies,3cwvke,GeorgeTheGeorge,3,Sat Jul 11 15:01:17 2015 UTC,"I am one such member. The major limiting factor at this point is that I'd have to leave the alliance with my main to properly enjoy FW, and I really love being in Brave. I can leave an alt in the alliance for mails and such,  but not having access to everything would suck."
Bravenewbies,3cwvke,Frekavichk,4,Sat Jul 11 15:41:21 2015 UTC,"mmm. There are some main chars here too (me for one).   Maybe this is not a done thing and that's ok, but it'd be great if we can access info on certain Brave things. The recent Flight Club SIG for example is almost perfect for us to join.

Bravenewbies,3cu3oq,HeliosRed,2,Fri Jul 10 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting and good observation. I would also wonder how many people became more self sufficient. I know there was much talk about installing a trading alt in Jita and managing your own imports. I know I for one took that advice and did so, because at the time the YZ market was still being stood up and the defsunun market never got completely stood up. Once I got comfortable with importing I never went back. I relied on the YZ market only for loose ends and asap items like a contract fit.   In GE I was 100% buying on the local market. Taking that kind of volume off of the market and solo importing can have a pretty big affect on local market trade volume."

Bravenewbies,3cvwrs,Appoloin_Kuovo,3,Sat Jul 11 05:34:11 2015 UTC,I hear coolbean has somekind of buyback in yz
Bravenewbies,3cvwrs,Juliette_Moran,3,Sat Jul 11 05:52:36 2015 UTC,"I think Coolbean still operates out of YZ-. Search for the character ""Coolbeans Salvage"" and check the bio for details. He gives you 90% but takes a small shipping fee based on m3, utterly insignificant for modules, but potentially relevant if you are selling hulls or ore etc. He also accepts many things Zansha never touched. You do need to make a 0 isk contract to him, but he did not scam me when I was in Brave, and I doubt he will scam anyone now."
Bravenewbies,3cvwrs,ArkonOlacar,3,Sat Jul 11 08:59:03 2015 UTC,If he was a scam the whole of EVE would know in 5 minutes.
Bravenewbies,3cvwrs,WDadade,0,Sat Jul 11 12:38:28 2015 UTC,"Contact Tobo Zansha, i can give you a better price on the Deadspace/faction stuff.    The 80% had to be done because everything i normally reprocess for minerals now has to go to high sec.  You could maybe get more out Coolbeans, but hes the same group that is camping the undock.  I also havent seen him sponser any Brave dojo activites lately, so support the people that support Brave."
Bravenewbies,3cvwrs,Dancing_Ninja,5,Sat Jul 11 13:16:06 2015 UTC,"If one person is offering 10% more money to brave members, it's pretty weird to suggest they support brave less.  That said, I will never make a 0-isk contract."

Bravenewbies,3cvwrs,coffeerocks,2,Sat Jul 11 14:21:14 2015 UTC,"^ This. If you need help understanding the nuances to why Zanshas prices have changed, I'm sure they'd explain the marketing reasons behind it."
Bravenewbies,3cvwrs,Paul_Brinkhoff,0,Sat Jul 11 23:17:31 2015 UTC,Get them to Hisec (3 Jumps from our staging) contract the stuff to your neutral hisec dude and move them to the nearest tradehub.  But make sure you use instas etc. Or just contract them with the dudes that will import stuff from dodixie anyway. You should never sell super expensive stuff to buybacks anyway.
Bravenewbies,3cvwrs,ThomasMarkov,4,Sat Jul 11 09:57:48 2015 UTC,Get your head out of your ass and read your own post. You asked for an alternative and Paul offered what is likely the best alternative.

Clone soldier and Mordu's hunting, DED sites, low sec missions (including level 5 in groups!). Other decent sources of income will be PI, exploration, wormhole daytripping (wormholes much more common in low sec)."

I haven't spent a lot of time in NPC null but it looks like it might be promising for people that like stuff like that.  I'm not really sure how anoms work in NPC null since systems aren't upgraded.
Bravenewbies,3csdbm,ExF-Altrue,2,Fri Jul 10 13:20:21 2015 UTC,"As a Syndicate resident, I cannot be happier that you guys are moving back to the area.  Syndicate is a good place to go for small gang PvP.  You can try running anoms, but like others have said, they aren't sov level.  One of the better ways to make Isk is actually running DED sites."
Bravenewbies,3csdbm,radicalmoments,3,Fri Jul 10 23:26:05 2015 UTC,"There are fewer anoms, and they don't instantly respawn. No where near as consistent as sov null, but available."
Bravenewbies,3csdbm,ExF-Altrue,3,Fri Jul 10 13:24:52 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply!  From what I'm seeing with the increased easy of logistics due to our close proximity to hi sec coupled with our 5 jumps from NPC null this looks like a really good plan.

Bravenewbies,3csdbm,Cornak,0,Fri Jul 10 16:03:42 2015 UTC,"Legit question, why pick http://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Aunsou_IV_-_Moon_3_-_Core_Complexion_Inc._Factory  this station   over  http://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Aunsou_III_-_Moon_4_-_Ishukone_Corporation_Factory this one?  ~15km docking radius vs. 45-50km docking radius."
Bravenewbies,3csdbm,X_D,4,Fri Jul 10 14:25:47 2015 UTC,"Docking radius on 4-3 is higher than 10km first off. The main reason is one of my requirements was to have a 50% refine in our home station to make mineral imports, and newbie manufacturing a bit easier. No need to deal with freighters and stuff this way."
Bravenewbies,3csdbm,Cornak,-2,Fri Jul 10 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"It's ~15km, but the issue is that capitals float off of it within ~15 seconds because of their size + the quick bumps. The other thing is that if you undock, you're basically commited/can easily be bumped off of the undock. Both of these are not newbie friendly. Like, you know how BRAVE likes to do that thing where you undock and just chill for a bit? You'll chill right off the undock pretty quick."
Bravenewbies,3csdbm,X_D,3,Fri Jul 10 15:52:19 2015 UTC,Because you left with all your smarts and experience...

Bravenewbies,3csdbm,Cornak,4,Fri Jul 10 14:49:36 2015 UTC,"3-4 doesn't have a 50% refine, and 4-3 is a 20km radius."
Bravenewbies,3csdbm,X_D,-5,Fri Jul 10 15:38:47 2015 UTC,"A) who cares about refining, caring about idiot mining corps is one of the things that got you into this shit situation in the first place  B) 4-3 gives you 45-50km from undock -> out of undock range. I'll post a picture in 11j when I get there, and then suggest you get fired as a recon director.  picture (GR8 QUALITY), I kinda went off at an angle, but you undock in that little hanger thingie."
Bravenewbies,3csdbm,Cornak,4,Fri Jul 10 15:44:55 2015 UTC,A) The people who told me find a 50% refine.  B) Compromise. There's no perfect station in system but this is the best option.
Bravenewbies,3csdbm,VoodooRin,-4,Fri Jul 10 15:47:58 2015 UTC,"See, that's what you should say the first time, not make up dumb numbers. Oh well, it's going to be fun farming people that undock and are not able to redock within 10s thanks to this highly thought out ""industry"" decision."

Bravenewbies,3ctp3a,NullRazor,3,Fri Jul 10 23:29:16 2015 UTC,"No implants? Ok, time for some tweaks! :D  1) replace one gyro with Inertial Stabs II and you don't need implant anymore! Volley is 1118 (958+160)  2) These Republic gyrostabs go for 65m each! For that price you can fly Garmur (wanna fit? :P  )! If you replace remaining 2 with T2 ones, volley damage will be 1087 for much more affordable price.  3) Align is 2.2 (for all skills V) so warpout is 3 sec. Lets try to go for 2 sec warpout! Replace another gyrostab for 2nd Inertial Stab II and you have 1.9 align and 2 sec warpout, just as with taxi interceptors (but without interdiction nullify). Volley dmg with one T2 Gyro: 1037 (877+160).  Ohh, and with one T2 Gyro and 2 Inertia Stabs you have enough cpu to fit Warp Disruptor II or other ewar in remaining mid slot (without implants).

Bravenewbies,3csgz4,General_Alpha,3,Fri Jul 10 12:19:51 2015 UTC,"This system is my personal favorite choice for systems, with the P4M3 and P3M4(Ishukone) stations being the top competitors. This station hits every mark except research, however research can be found at multiple other stations within the system. Sadly, there is no instaundock moon, but given that bubbles are no longer a threat, I feel like we can just make sure they have a safe and be done with it. As many of you have probably noticed from your office buying spree, it has plenty of offices available. In general, the station is just about the best we’re going to get, as nothing actually meets all 11 options, the main problem criterion being the instaundock moon. Industry and refining are both in this station, so we don’t need to worry about transporting large volumes, just blueprints. The system itself is also good, with 9 stations to prevent camps, containing full service coverage within the system, so we won’t need to travel. And if you do need to travel, it’s got two pipe systems, a pocket, and a path to the market hub all adjacent to it, so navigation is easy, and camping us in is hard. Plus it gives us a temporary market until we have one. It has a low moon count, meaning we can tower the whole system. Content is fairly likely given the Stacmon, Syndicate, and Ostingele connections, and Faction Warfare is a good deal closer to this system. Plus the lack of belts encourages people not to mine in staging. It trades distance to null for being closer to the hottest Faction Warfare zone, as well as being only three jumps out from a major market hub and two from a major EVE Uni system.  Excerpt."

The closest high-sec staging is Stacmon.  If war targets are harassing you in Stacmon, and you don't want to hang out in low-sec yet, you can try heading over to Brellystier.  It's a few more jumps out, but it's in the middle of a ""high-sec island"", so WTs are less likely to follow you out there."
Bravenewbies,3cnz7c,Solomon_Phi,4,Thu Jul 9 11:33:33 2015 UTC,"For those who don’t know me, I’m flying in BRAVE FW Corp, Kill Them With Kindness  During our Aridia days I realised just how shit I was at PvP. When the call was made to move to Fountain I stayed back in low sec and moved into Kill Them With Kindness, Brave's only FW Corp at the time. We fight for the Caldari Militia (CalMil) and currently at war with the Gallente Federation, which makes for some fun with our Privateer frenemies.  Brave Privateers has since reawakened and have been pinging propaganda so feel it’s only fair to make some of our own. Check out my dank photoshop skillz!     A little bit about Faction Warfare.  FW is played with any size of ship. This is a good link to read. In the FW Zones you have deadspace areas assigned to FW called plexes which you must capture (offensive plexing) or defend (defensive plexing). There are various sizes of plex which allow only certain types of ship into them. Novice (T1 and Faction frigates), Small (Frigates, Destroyers), Medium (Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers), Large (Unrestricted). This is great cos so at least I know I'll have a fight that's roughly on par with my level.  Small gang/solo pvp is pretty much exactly it but you also get to participate on larger militia fleets if you like.  There’s isk to be made if you work your loyalty points correctly.     A little bit about us  You can find KTWK on public channel ""Kill Them With Kindness"". CEO is Wrevock. Its small atm and is mostly solo because of this, but we’re growing every day and have had our first few gang roams of late. Come join in, we could do with moar dps.  FW is proving a great success with respect to learning PvP. It's a most accessible and reliable source of pew pew in EVE and it's def helping me (still very much a Brave Newbie) with PvP and ship piloting practice. I'm still shit imo- but the PvP fear has gone, I'm dying less and I'm understanding more about piloting my ships based on fit.  7o Solomon  EDITED FOR STUFF"

Bravenewbies,3cnrj2,Chie_Okanata,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:54:12 2015 UTC,Not worried... Just passing the time at work
Bravenewbies,3cnrj2,JesusbeJesus,2,Thu Jul 9 11:02:38 2015 UTC,Don't know - I have a stack of special snowflake type evacuations; and also stuck at work....   I've also seen (out of date) figures saying over $1.2Trn of assets have already been moved.  That would not count all the private type moves and special snowflakie stuff.
Bravenewbies,3cnrj2,Solomon_Phi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:59:53 2015 UTC,"Well it looked like the Bacon finally came through.  Lettuce had a hell of time moving to the opsec, aka TOST. He got tore up pretty bad just outta of the FRDG-E system and Totmato had foresaw the move and already made his way through NIF-E and MA-OH.  He lost some cargo on the way in, but a couple of slices hit TOST.  Bacon had to go the long way around.  Through FIR-E and FLM-E and is a little crispy but still looking good.    sorry i'm bored at work..."
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,_CrazyLizard_,4,Thu Jul 9 04:16:27 2015 UTC,"My fucks given are long gone. Warped onto YZ- station at zero with the last ratting Vexor I have. Cargo is full of valuables that I painstakingly moved from Mermaid. Saw an Orthos on undock fucking with a Talwar. Said fuck it, turned on my afterburner and YOLO'd that SOB. Promptly got swatted, of course, and lost everything I had, but I can't be bothered to give any more shits about it or Fountain. I'm ready for a new beginning. Lets go already!"
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,2Mobile,4,Thu Jul 9 05:35:28 2015 UTC,Ooh. Are you by chance that dude that stated somewhere how he was only making 10m a week in a vexor yet flying T2 logi and really struggling financially?
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,ZheoTheThird,2,Thu Jul 9 17:11:49 2015 UTC,"lol yep, that's me!"
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,2Mobile,3,Thu Jul 9 17:35:12 2015 UTC,"Duuude. You need to work on that. 10m should be half an hour of belt ratting, if all you have is a vexor :p"
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,ZheoTheThird,2,Thu Jul 9 17:41:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, thats exactly what I was doing. Belt ratting. That posting did me alot of good. Got with some people and was taught how to work some anomalies. I can afford to lose t2 logi now with SRP. Makes playing logi alot more fun."
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,2Mobile,3,Thu Jul 9 17:44:49 2015 UTC,Nice! Financial independence is great.
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,ZheoTheThird,2,Thu Jul 9 17:47:53 2015 UTC,hells yes it is
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,2Mobile,2,Thu Jul 9 17:53:27 2015 UTC,"Mate,  i hate to tell you this but you seem to have gotten yourself shadowbanned. I don't know how since i can't see your history.  You need to do some research about how to fix it.  I understand there's a reddit post somewhere about how to fix it. .."
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,Cagali,2,Thu Jul 9 08:28:16 2015 UTC,What's it mean if you're shadow banned
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,tri_wolfman,3,Thu Jul 9 10:26:26 2015 UTC,"People can't see your posts.   So you post, but noone can read them.  There was a story a while back from a different subreddit where a user had been mistakenly shadowbanned sitewide and kept posting comments for over a year without getting a response before he figured it out."
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,Dwighty1,2,Thu Jul 9 10:44:03 2015 UTC,"I assume mods can see the posts, though.  Otherwise Cagali has an appointment at the nearest ducking-stool."
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,greyjackal,2,Thu Jul 9 11:33:53 2015 UTC,"I think they can.   I didn't know ""shadowban"" was a thing until I read that story a while back."
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,Dwighty1,2,Thu Jul 9 11:38:06 2015 UTC,What an odd kind of level of hell
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,tri_wolfman,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:59:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for the heads up! I found the subreddit that lets you know if you're shadowbanned and tells you how to appeal it. Already got in touch with an admin and apologized for my filthy sins.
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,2Mobile,2,Thu Jul 9 14:25:38 2015 UTC,care to fill us in on what happened?
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,Mitnik-,2,Thu Jul 9 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"I have more than one reddit account. One for work which is pretty bland and one for home use in which I visit questionable subreddits ;)  sometimes I visit the same site in both and I got caught karma slutting and upvoting my other reddit account. Its called vote manipulation. Anyways, its ban-able. Protip: Don't do it."
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,2Mobile,11,Thu Jul 9 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the sentiment and effort... But this just isn't good propaganda. (pinky out) the meme is old and tired and your usage is tangential, it's site generated and waterstamped, and it's not real pleasing to look at <.<  No down vote, and nothing but love for the message and effort, but no upvote."

Bravenewbies,3cn0db,Thera_Bound,3,Thu Jul 9 17:24:59 2015 UTC,I saw some of those TEST fleets get shooed away. Undock was entertaining tonight. Localchat butthurt was priceless about it too.
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,leroydfz,-2,Thu Jul 9 05:44:40 2015 UTC,"Really? I don't remember us ever getting ""shooed away"". We just finished sitting on your undock after about 5 hours or so until we finally left out of sheer boredom. Got about 70 kills tonight with barely a handful of losses."

Bravenewbies,3cn0db,OtakuCarnival,3,Thu Jul 9 13:15:59 2015 UTC,There are lots of good dudes in TEST.  Three months from now you may even look back on Fountain and be glad that TEST assisted in getting BRAVE out of that death-trap.
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,coffeerocks,4,Thu Jul 9 16:23:02 2015 UTC,"Oh, ofc there are! I'll unblock test at some point, but for now it's just not worth the local spam, that's all.   I still consider most test bros = best bros.  But, I will say: ""TEST assisted?"" Ha-ha...noooo. Not sure what you think they are doing here, but they are just station camping, talking (incredible amounts of) shit about Brave, and spamming recruitment adverts."
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,OtakuCarnival,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:26:38 2015 UTC,TEST corporations deployed there to pile-on; not just roam over for a fight.  I wouldn't underestimate their power of weaponized-autism to keep nerds from wanting to log in.  Just ask Roweena Azur.
Bravenewbies,3cn0db,ArchAengelus,0,Thu Jul 9 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"TEST here, can confirm the dogpile.  And the spam.  If you just block Dreddit, 95% of of the local chat autism goes away.  BTW, if you want to see something surprising look at Dreddit's KB stats this week/month.  It's shameful.  For us (in Star Frontiers)."
