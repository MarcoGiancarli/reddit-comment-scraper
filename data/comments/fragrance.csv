fragrance,3dwf9g,H0kusai,2,Tue Jul 21 03:10:35 2015 UTC,"Living in Scandinavia. I'm rarely bothered by hot and humid weather, but for those really warm summer days, I prefer an Eau de Cologne (denoting the light fragrance style invented by Farina in the early 18th century, not ""cologne"" in modern U.S. parlance).   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eau_de_Cologne  While the original by Farina is still produced in Cologne, it is relatively expensive to obtain outside of Germany due to their absurd shipping rates.   https://farina1709.de/en/eau-de-cologne-original  The copy cat 4711 is widely available, but in its present form doesn't do the style any justice (reportedly, it was still quite good in the fifties, but it is now a shrill and vulgar parody). Due to the rather aggressive marketing of a fake background story it's often mistaken to be the original, especially outside Germany. /pet peeve  I very much like the Acqua de Colognia by Villoresi.   http://www.lorenzovilloresi.it/en/catalogo/7007/acqua-di-colonia.html  A proper Eau de Cologne is most definitely unisex, quite a few men would probably think of it as ""female"", but that is another can of worms.   Edit: Do not let uninformed criticism about it being short lived fool you, this style of fragrance just isn't meant or designed for longevity, but rather to be reapplied as a refreshing splash."

And if you like the Jardin series from Hermes, also check out some of  their Hermessence frags, they are executed in the same transparent style that Jean Claude Ellena is famous for.

Depending on your funds, my go-to warm weather scent is Bergamote 22 by Le Labo. Read reviews or watch You Tube reviews. It's a bright, sparkling citrus with beautiful vetiver notes.

Cheapie florals like Lush's Lust and Avon's Haiku do great in the humidity (especially at the beach!), and if you're careful with it, you can still wear them at the office without being too overbearing. Gucci Guilty and Hanae Mori are friends' favorites, and those you can find in Sephora.  Summer's also really fun if you like sugary gourmands; one of my old roommates uses Prada's Candy very sparingly and it works fine without destroying the air with sweetness."

Voyage d'Hermes might also be up your alley if you enjoy fresh, spicy, vegetal fragrances. My personal favorite for the summer heat (I'm a Floridian, so I'm accustomed to the heat index pushing well above 100 degrees) is Dior Homme Sport (2012). It's got a playful citron/lemon and ginger vibe, backed up by a sweet, powdery iris. Fantastic for the summer, and really only for the summer.

fragrance,3duz5o,fatalecs,7,Sun Jul 19 18:59:46 2015 UTC,"well i wouldn't say ones you should have in your collection because everyone has different tastes. you don't need to fluff your collection with scents just because they're popular (especially if you hate the smell). of course there are people that collect scents and will buy it because they need it in their collection.  i would more say, you should smell some essentials to get a better grasp of what things are like.  i always recommend burberry london for fall/winter but i have my own memories that i've tied to it so i'm probably very biased. mont blanc legend & individuel are classics at this point. they're great smelling, just not outstanding. acqua di gio obviously is a very popular fragrance. boss bottled (boss no. 6) is probably the best in the hugo boss line. i'd give 1 million a smell (though you've probably smelled it on someone already) just because i think it's a well composed scent with (unfortunately) bad associations in the frag com due to it's popularity. nautica voyage is thrown around a lot as well.  as for semi niche, i'd take a look at the hermes offerings. particularly voyage d'hermes and terre d'hermes. those are two very safe scents that are more unique than the designer offerings. i'd also give black orchid by tom ford a good smell. it's a heavier fragrance but very complex and well composed (though i'm more partial to the women targeted velvet orchid).  for the niche, obviously you have to smell aventus at least once (or wear it out once). people hate it because it's so popular now but i still consider it a staple for going out in the summer. green irish tweed would also be a must wear (or cool water by davidoff if you just want to stick to designer offerings). the opening is harsh but the drydown with the lemon verbena and that synthetic lavender smelling molecule (dihydromyrcenol) that mix with the ambroxan in a really well designed way. the other heavy hitting ""niche"" starter would be in the tom ford private blend. tobacco vanille and tuscan leather are some good ones to smell. there are some very interesting/popular ones offered by xerjoff as well but that's starting to get more specialized and not really a ""must have""."
fragrance,3duz5o,aeriis,3,Sun Jul 19 19:21:45 2015 UTC,"I think it all depends on what type of collector you are.

It comes of with a fruitish vibe similar to that of L'homme and has a very nice watermelon note. It's a very safe scent that everyone will like, versatile, last at least 6-8 hours, and projects decently. I got it a few weeks ago and have been wearing it everyday to summer class at my college. I tend to like very safe colognes that smells nice to the general public, so stuff like Bleu, AHS, L'homme, GPHII are my usual go to for daily wear, and I think Chic holds itself pretty well amongst these. Definitely look into it.   Some others that people have mentions are   Issey Miyake L'Eau d'Issey (very sharp citrus with nice floral overtone. Some people say its too sharp or feminine but I think it's great) Hanae Mori HM (vey sweet lemon. Not a fan of this but my mom like it and so do the ladies) CAHEB (The old one was great, though I never got my hands one a bottle. Heard that the reformulation isn't as good, and Chanel also    jacked up the price by changing it to an EDP) Terre d'Hermes (If you are 25+ this will be good. Earthy woody orange.

fragrance,3dq7d9,hopelesslycharmed,3,Sat Jul 18 11:17:13 2015 UTC,"Were you trying to format the list into bulletpoints? You gotta put a space between the asterisk and the item for that to work.  I don't smoke myself, but some of my best college buddies are smokers. I can tell you right now that aquatics and citruses won't mask smoke. Most of the blue/bleus won't work because they're too light. In general you have to either cool it on the smoking to less than half pack a day or overspray to mask the smoke.  If you smoke a ton and don't take care to do things like remove your outerwear when you do (I did business in school; we took off our blazers to minimize the smell when we went out), there really isn't anything to do for the smell."

I used to smoke half a pack a day.  I dont wish to mask the smell but it would be nice if I could get recommendations on how I could blend the right perfume with the given circumstances above.

fragrance,3dq7d9,acleverpseudonym,2,Sat Jul 18 15:49:19 2015 UTC,"No the edp vs edt thing in my opinion is a dated measurement since with modern perfumery you can have a small amount of something that creates a huge aroma where in the older times strength was usually increased by adding more essential oils. The Dior works well because it's a richer, complex scent that naturally has facets with tobacco like notes so adding more smoke in my opinion tends to just get blended into the scent better. A good analogy would be the effect of adding an additional spice to a chili versus adding a spice to a chicken broth. One already has a lot going on and the other is going to be affected by anything new."
fragrance,3dq7d9,elemonated,2,Sat Jul 18 17:23:09 2015 UTC,"There's often a difference in the formulation between EdPs and EdTs though nowadays. Since IFRA limits for ingredients are measured against the post dilution formula, you often can't just increase the concentration of the EdT to make the EdP without violating a standard, so to make an EdP version of an EdT they have to reformulate. It's usually worth sniffing both to see which one someone likes better."

fragrance,3djl9s,mr_glasses,2,Fri Jul 17 11:44:04 2015 UTC,You're right.  The lavender is strong on this one.
fragrance,3djl9s,salt_and_linen,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:57:49 2015 UTC,"Alright, thanks! I like a good lavender so I'm still going to try it eventually, maybe get a bottle since it's not too expensive."
fragrance,3djl9s,salt_and_linen,2,Fri Jul 17 12:15:12 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: I have never tried this (it's on the to do list).  What about Mona di Orio's Vanille?  LuckyScent's ad copy:   The Scoop  When composing Vanille, Mona di Orio imagined a romantic back story involving an old ship from long ago, on its way to Madagascar or the Comoros Islands, carrying precious cargo: rum barrels, oranges, vanilla beans, ylang-ylang, cloves and sandalwood.   Gourmand, smoky, and boozy with a subtle aromatic orange note lingering in the background, Vanille is one Bateau Ivre of perfectly blended notes that will derange your senses with its sensuality.   Vanille opens with a shot of rum flavored with an orange rind and spiced with cloves. Amber and tonka further warm up this brew as ylang-ylang's sharp sweetness joins with rich vanilla. Gaiac wood adds incensey smoke as woody notes from vetiver and sandalwood help to create an elegant finish.   But the real star of the show, not surprisingly, is vanilla. Instead of using ethyl vanillin, one of vanilla’s main components that can come across as powdery and sugary, Mona di Orio used pure vanilla in this elixir. For a moment — amid this elegant orchestral arrangement of notes in the key of Vanilla — the pulpy, sensual creaminess of a split vanilla bean is right there in front of your nose. Delicious!   Vanille - Les Nombres d’Or Notes  Brazilian orange, Indonesian cloves, petit grain, rum extract, Bourbon vetiver, ylang-ylang, Indian sandalwood, gaiac wood, Vanilla absolute from Madagascar, amber, tonka bean"
fragrance,3djl9s,BW4LL,2,Thu Jul 16 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"Ooh, that sounds good. I'll add that to my wishlist. Thanks! I just hope it's not too smokey or boozey."
fragrance,3djl9s,daneshpastry,2,Thu Jul 16 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"Agonist's Vanilla Marble is also a fine vanilla, but that one I would not call dark. It's kinda coconut-y.  Have you tried Jalaine? Both silk and vanilla are intoxicating vanillas but both had sort of a plastic-y note on my skin  Edit: one more. Have you tried Indult's Tihota?"
fragrance,3djl9s,daneshpastry,2,Thu Jul 16 20:50:18 2015 UTC,"I have Tihota in my wishlist, I need to save up and get a decant from luckyscent soon. It sounds really good. I'd read up on vanilla marble and it's on my to try list eventually but yeah it sounds like opposite of what I'm looking for for this particular scent. Kind of like a cool 'white' vanilla. I'm looking more for a dark brown, warm scented one.  I've not tried Jalaine, I'll go read up on it! Thanks!"
fragrance,3djl9s,dihedral_prime,2,Thu Jul 16 20:58:30 2015 UTC,Maybe Eau Des Baux or Spiritueuse Double Vanille?
fragrance,3djl9s,dihedral_prime,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:56:06 2015 UTC,I've has Eau Des Baux on my watch for a while. Do you know if it's particularly strong on the vanilla? I wish I could get Double Vanille but it's on the too expensive for me side and I'm afraid I'd really love it and could not afford it.
fragrance,3djl9s,dihedral_prime,2,Thu Jul 16 21:32:43 2015 UTC,SDV smells like vanilla extract and nothing more....you're not missing much.
fragrance,3djl9s,chuckfalzone,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:10:01 2015 UTC,I'd love that though. :) I guess I could put on some vanilla extract as perfume.
fragrance,3djl9s,Kill_the_Acquitted,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:13:16 2015 UTC,Would save you a few bills. It honestly smells like William Sonoma.
fragrance,3djl9s,chuckfalzone,2,Fri Jul 17 00:58:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, EdB is intense. Don't blind buy it. It gets a lot of praise but when I tried it at a local L'Occitane store, I nearly had to scrub it off my skin, it was nauseating.  By the way, the first thing that came to mind reading your post was Bvlgari Black. It's definitely worth a shot especially considering its price."
fragrance,3djl9s,SobrietySchmobriety,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:55:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks! It sounds great from the notes but I've found I really need to try fragrances first, you're right.   In another forum I had quite a few people recommend me Tobacco Vanille, I love a few Tom Ford fragrances but I never got around to trying that one. Well, I hardly got hardly any vanilla, it was way in the background, this was all spicy dried fruits and booze on me. I was dumbfounded, but maybe some amp the vanilla.   Bvlgari Black and Midnight in Paris are also on my to try list. But I was under the impression that BB was a more 'whiter' or light vanilla? Not the darker kind?"
fragrance,3djl9s,pageplantzoso,2,Fri Jul 17 12:02:23 2015 UTC,"My impressions might be influenced by the name of the fragrance (""Black"") but on my skin, it has a very dark, mysterious and deep type of scent. I would compare it to Fahrenheit, although the two aren't really that similar in the way they smell, in my opinion they suit the same type of personality, the difference being that Black is not drenched in testosterone.   Like Dior's classic, it can be an incredibly fitting accessory if your wardrobe mostly consists of black and grey stuff with some whites thrown in. Give it a try."
fragrance,3djl9s,space_madnesss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:47:39 2015 UTC,"You've sold me on Black, I think I will order the 1oz since it's very expensive. I don't mind all types of vanillas, it's just that I've been looking for a specific 'dark brown', deep bourbon vanilla type fragrance for so long with no luck. I'm female but I own many unisex and 'men's' fragrances. My latest fragrance love is Uomo from Valentino, that one is divine to me."
fragrance,3djl9s,hold_my_pabst,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:14:13 2015 UTC,Expensive? Have you checked Fragrancenet? You can get a 2.5 oz bottle for 40 USD.
fragrance,3djl9s,hold_my_pabst,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:55:15 2015 UTC,Did I say expensive? Oops I meant inexpensive. I remember seeing a 1oz for around $20 in fragrancenet.
fragrance,3djl9s,hold_my_pabst,2,Fri Jul 17 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"Just a note, and maybe you already know this, but it's a common misconception: ""bourbon vanilla"" is not bourbon whiskey + vanilla, it's just a variety of vanilla that's grown in Madagascar, named after an island near Madagascar that used to be named  Île Bourbon."
fragrance,3djl9s,Princess_By_Day,2,Thu Jul 16 21:14:25 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I totally know. :) Which is why I specifically noted that I'm hoping for no boozey vanilla recommendations.

fragrance,3djl9s,valhrona,2,Fri Jul 17 00:25:05 2015 UTC,Maybe Lattafa Raghba?
fragrance,3djl9s,mintings,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:39:06 2015 UTC,"Ooh, I just looked it up. It looks really interesting. Thank you!"
fragrance,3djl9s,valhrona,2,Fri Jul 17 00:40:09 2015 UTC,Musc Ravageur!
fragrance,3djl9s,Samsquaanch,2,Fri Jul 17 00:17:15 2015 UTC,"Ugh I want to try a Malle fragrance so badly, one of these days when I can save up enough. This one is definitely on the top of my list. I had it down for the musk but I didn't realize it also smelled of vanilla, now I really want to try. Thanks for the recommendation!"
fragrance,3dji20,dolorose,4,Thu Jul 16 19:46:54 2015 UTC,Fragrancenet is cheap and reliable
fragrance,3dji20,SobrietySchmobriety,2,Thu Jul 16 21:18:34 2015 UTC,Fragrancenet.com is really good. There is also beautyspin.com. With Amazon I try to stick to things sold directly by Amazon and have had no problems.
fragrance,3dji20,tri_it,2,Thu Jul 16 22:52:47 2015 UTC,Both fragrancenet and Amazon are great. For Amazon only get it if it's sold by Amazon.
fragrance,3dji20,Ofsomewhatimportance,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:27:42 2015 UTC,Any sites for Canadians?
fragrance,3dj1lq,Firecracker500,2,Thu Jul 16 17:48:11 2015 UTC,"copy paste from here: https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/3ajsdi/a_bit_of_general_information_for_guys_new_to/   But I stay away from celebrity fragrances, they are usually very synthetic, perform poorly, and are overpriced. If that $35 bottle didn't have David and Victoria Beckhams name it would probably cost about $5."

fragrance,3dj1lq,theonlybluecow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:41 2015 UTC,"Poor performance, below average scent. Stay away from them."
fragrance,3dj1lq,Sic1337,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:45:05 2015 UTC,I wore a David Beckham in the past. It was very artificial and lasted only for about two hours. :(
fragrance,3dj1lq,ehubusa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:54:42 2015 UTC,"I have David Beckham Instinct and I've found the longevity and projection to be quite excellent. Easily on par with something like Nautica Voyage.  Maybe I just got a lucky batch but I was very pleasantly surprised. The smell itself is an ok-but-not-amazing vetiver, which in itself isn't a bad thing because there aren't many cheap vetiver fragrances around."
fragrance,3djbf1,SlimSmokey,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:58:48 2015 UTC,"DHI I would say is a bit polarizing. Though I own both, I like DHI more, but wear TdH more because of its versatility."
fragrance,3djbf1,pageplantzoso,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:09:44 2015 UTC,I like both but Terre D'Hermes is one of my favorites and will always be in my top 5.
fragrance,3djbf1,1Raizen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:41:58 2015 UTC,"TDH wins for me hands-down. I wish I didn't like it so much, but it's just a fantastic combo. Great scent, definitely a crowd pleaser."
fragrance,3djbf1,42232300,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:53:29 2015 UTC,"I own both, and I suggest you eventually get both as well. However, for me, TDH is a warmer weather fragrance. DHI on the other hand is really only for cooler weather. If you're looking for a fall/winter frag right now, go with DHI. TDH CAN be worn year-round, but I feel like the real magic of it comes out when it's a bit warmer outside. Perhaps buy TDH when the snow melts if you're still considering it."
fragrance,3djbf1,janglekey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:08:10 2015 UTC,I would say Tdh.  I don't really like the Dior Homme serie at all tbh.
