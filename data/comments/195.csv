195,39p8qz,GenericUsername02,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:43:39 2015 UTC,"No, people keep asking, though, so here's a copypasta of the explanation:  It has to do with panting. ""Funět"" means to pant in Czech and when I was little and used to go to school with my sister I would pant because she was bigger and older than me and I had problems to catch up with her. Idk exactly when it happened, but she called me ""funík"" a couple of times, I think, and I made a nickname out of it later. It is not easily translatable, but I think ""the little one who pants"" could be fitting."
