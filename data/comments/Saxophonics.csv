I played soprano almost exclusively for the last few years with various blues / rock bands. Without fail, any time I played a gig I'd get a few ""Kenny G"" comments. And 50% of the time someone after the show would come up and say ""You were AMAZING on the clarinet!""   When I finally broke down and switched to Tenor, the respect level with the band and with the crowd immediately went through the roof. Long story short, added a Bari to the collection a few weeks ago, and killed it at a gig on Saturday night.   PS - I have an 82z tenor. Awesome horn.   TL;DR: Lower is better."

The way I learned to transpose is just think of it as numbers, B=3, A=2, G=1, in that key. The key of G on alto is C on tenor (concert Bb, probably the hardest part to memorize at first). So the B, A, G now is E(3), D(2), C(1) on tenor. As she learns more notes, so will you in transposing and you're transposing will improve as she does."

Have you just 'dabbled' for years or can you actually play with reasonable technique?  If you're confident enough, then I would recommend some basics like embouchure as you've said. But don't focus on technique too much at the beginning. It has to be fun, so early on she should have the opportunity to learn songs she likes. Then use those as vessels to work on embouchure, tone, etc.  Make sure that she doesn't automatically start with bad habits like using an extra finger on the bis key. Teach more than one fingering for a Bb, it will help later on."
Saxophonics,3e42f9,terrapin1203,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:34:09 2015 UTC,"Teach more than one fingering for a Bb, it will help later on.   It's wayyyyy too confusing to teach a beginner multiple fingerings for Bb. They can learn that when they're at a higher level than leaning B, A, and G. It's too confusing until they get to a level where knowing multiple Bb's would actually be useful, like playing in more difficult keys and extremely fast passages."
Saxophonics,3e42f9,disgruntleddave,-1,Wed Jul 22 03:33:03 2015 UTC,"It's confusing if you try to just teach them as alternate fingerings. The easy way to teach it to a beginner such that it wouldn't overload them and would actually feel natural from the get-go is if you teach different fingerings purely contextually.  Eg: Just playing the note, use the bis key. Going up use the bis key. Going down, use the side Bb key. Teach the multiples exclusively in the context of when you would actually use them.   Maybe I'm seeing it unrealistically. I guess she is 9 years old. But there's no reason she can't be exposed to them in specific settings. I agree that just dumping all the multiple fingerings on a new player would be more confusing than helpful."
Saxophonics,3e42f9,terrapin1203,2,Wed Jul 22 03:38:19 2015 UTC,"Personally I just think it would be more worth it for a beginner to spend their time learning simple scales, and even the chromatic scale. Like I said, they won't be playing in difficult keys or fast passages for a long time, which is the case where alternate Bb's are usually the most useful."

Teacher her simple rhythms, whole notes, half notes, quarter notes.  Then do simple songs, Mary Had a Little Lamb, Hot Crossed Buns, etc.  Then just keep teaching her notes and have her learn the G Major scale.  Teach more complex rhythms (8th notes, dotted quarters and halves) Move on to other scales (I'm still perfecting this one. If she has a good low range then do D major, then F major, then A major. I also like C major but it's hard if they can't do low C. A minor is also good to introduce minor keys) At this point they should be able to play basic etudes in those keys, and start to incorporate scale patters. By having a good foundation in 4 or so keys, it'll make it much easier to learn the other 8 majors and the relative minors."

Even if you end up playing just once in a while, the Meyer will make it more enjoyable and makes sense as an investment. Trust your teacher, it will just make everything feel and sound better.

It will improve your experience right away and a basic Meyer can take you pretty far.  My first upgraded mouthpiece was a Meyer 5M, I eventually switched to something fancier but now years later I've recently switched back to that same Meyer!  Had it for maybe 15 years.  It's easy to control, flexible, and much better than a stock plastic mouthpiece.    There are other options in the $100 range from Selmer and Vandoren if you're interested in shopping around, but this early in the game I wouldn't worry about it too much.  It is a good idea to play test a mouthpiece before you buy though, if you buy from a store.    Keep in mind it isn't essential that you replace your mouthpiece immediately or anything.  Your teacher should help you do that at a pace you're ok with.  You can make progress even without a new mouthpiece.  But your teacher is right about the benefits you're likely to get and it's a good investment if you already know you're going to devote some time to saxophone."

That said, the Meyer is a great mouthpiece and I don't think you'd be disappointed if you're willing to spend the money. It's a better long term investment if you think you'll be playing at least a few more years."

Saxophonics,3dxdf7,gangstarockanrolla,8,Mon Jul 20 09:07:48 2015 UTC,"I say bad idea. Get a wind controller to learn to play a wind controller. Practice an actual sax to learn sax.   Unless your wind controller is shaped and weighted exactly like a sax, then none of what you learn on it would transfer to your sax. Even if it was, you'd only improve fingering and nothing else.   Sure, practicing any instrument will improve overall musical chops and manual dexterity, and that will make it easier to learn the sax later on but the knowledge/skills don't transfer directly IMHO, especially if you are a beginner or intermediate."
Saxophonics,3dxdf7,domesticatedprimate,3,Mon Jul 20 12:49:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed. While playing sax for years has made me great at sightreading, it hasn't made me better at playing the clarinet (which I don't practice anymore), but it has made be better at sight reading while playing clarinet (similar fingerings in the second octave, but totally different embouchure, etc).   That being said, if you absolutely can't practice sax at home, I suppose it's better than nothing."

As domesticatedprimate points out, it's not exactly learning the sax, but for learning songs, yes it translated very nicely since the fingering is largely the same. Given a situation in which I couldn't otherwise get much practice time in, it was well worth it. Not to mention that I use my wx7 in real gigs occasionally.  I bought my wx7 on ebay many years ago for around $400."
Saxophonics,3dxdf7,bwanab,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:33 2015 UTC,depends on what you need to practice. I think it would be fun to practice on a wind controller. It might be ok if you practiced on a wind controller during the week then practiced your real sax on the weekends
Saxophonics,3dw77r,rainheater,7,Mon Jul 20 01:18:20 2015 UTC,"No different whatsoever. But some people out there think there is a difference which will affect the resale value, but the instrument is exactly the same and will play exactly the same as a Japanese model."

Saxophonics,3dten3,tomcam,5,Sun Jul 19 07:26:18 2015 UTC,"The build quality of the larger Taiwanese companies is pretty impressive nowadays (as opposed to the vast gulf there used to be between French/Japanese made and other horns). Names like Cannonball and P Mauriat are somewhat well respected, and come in at well under the price of new Yamahas or Selmers.  I myself own a Cannonball soprano from around 2011, and it's got a really great sound with plenty of personality (personality! From a non-pro-level manufacturer!), and the build quality is pretty good. However, for the professional player there's still a noticeable difference between these horns and, say, a new Yamaha 82Z or Selmer SA80.  I'd say that's where the biggest bargains are to be had in new horns at the moment, unfortunately many coming out of China simply aren't up to scratch as far as build quality and materials are concerned, and even intermediate Yamaha 32s can feel remarkable next to one (source: when I went shopping for a Bari).  Of course, this is all pretty much entirely anecdotal, which in the saxophone business is exactly what you're going to get. My rule with horns is always, ALWAYS, play it before you buy it! A cheaper horn might play beautifully and sit better with you than a $15,000 behemoth, and you might not find out until you try them!  Also (just briefly), don't rule out second hand saxes or ""vintage"" saxes, particularly Yamahas and Selmers, and not necessarily those that are ""desirable"" models/serial numbers. There are some fantastic Selmer Mark VII/Yamaha 62s out there. Big old American Conns and Beuschers are also a bit cheaper, but the intonation, ergos and playability will probably be very different to any other horn you've played before!  TLDR Try lots of horns, new and second handers. Taiwanese made>Chinese made (generally)  Source: am final year Saxophone student at uni (college) in Australia"

This helps with blend in classical ensembles and tuning issues.  Also, if this horn is going to be mostly for classical use, I'd stay away from Mark VI and Balanced Action saxes if you would like a Selmer.

All great horns, all with a high F# key.   There are people who will bleat that the VI is the best horn ever. There are also people who will bleat that the VI is a bad horn that can't compete with modern horns, and is simply hyped up. Both sides have varying degrees of incorrectness. I own a Yamaha Custom EX alto and soprano, but my tenor is a Mark VI. It's a fantastic horn. Like you said, the lack of the F# key is a bummer, but you learn to play without it.  At the end of the day, play horns and pick the one that sounds best for you. If you really want a horn with a high F# key, go for it. The modern horns have many advancements in technology that the Mark VI simply doesn't have. That doesn't make the VI a bad horn by any means - many are killer.

Saxophonics,3dp94g,TriggerPete,3,Sat Jul 18 15:25:52 2015 UTC,"A lot of this depends on your level of ability because it's better to play a good audition on one piece than a slightly less than sparkling on audition on something that might have been too hard. Do you play much classical saxophone? Specifically do you know any classical solo pieces, and which ones?"
Saxophonics,3dp94g,TriggerPete,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:31:28 2015 UTC,"I have very little experience with classical saxophone, and I haven't generally gone out of my way to play it (at least not in a long while). I'm pretty clueless in this area :I"
Saxophonics,3dp94g,Saxyphone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:28:52 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, ok well a concert band audition will want to hear something like a classical solo. If you haven't played many, there are a few standard beginner solos to pick from. Check out these few of my favorites:  Aria - Eugene Bozza Chanson et Passepied -Jeanine Rueff Sonata - Henri Eccles  The Sonata has multiple movements, so choosing two contrasting (fast and slow) is a good idea.  If you choose the Aria, be wary. It looks easy, but it's deceptively difficult to play well. Done well, I would guess it's impressive enough to make up for a faster movement, but done badly, it's a kicker.  The Chanson is a very good middle of the road piece. Not too difficult, but very musical and enjoyable when played well.   My advice is to listen to all of them, choose which seems to stand out to you, then really buckle down and listen intently. If you haven't played a lot, you'll need to try to imitate very good recordings to get the little things right-- not just notes and rhythms.   I hope this helps, good luck!"
Saxophonics,3dp94g,OrdinaryGamer12,3,Sat Jul 18 16:47:32 2015 UTC,"My first year of college I found a lot of success with Henry Eccles Sonata. It's relatively easy, but allows for a lot of musical freedom and I think it's a good piece to demonstrate musical talent.   As someone else said, it's better to play a simpler piece  well than try something that might be a bit too hard. Don't try to overdo it, just play what you know you can play well."

Saxophonics,3dl71g,lejazzvp,2,Fri Jul 17 05:07:28 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow. This certainly drastically reduces your options, especially if you're after a metal mouthpiece. Basically, you could get a used, modern Super Tone Master and have someone reface it so it sounds and responds more like your friend's piece.   Otherwise, it will be tough to find a metal piece that sounds like your friend's below $500. Drake Metal Mouthpieces are $500, the Phil Tone Tribute is $525, the Theo Wanne Gaia is $725, etc."
Saxophonics,3dl71g,lbcsax,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:16:43 2015 UTC,Im not especially after a metal one. But that would be my next step. Honestly I will probably increase my price range quite a bit after marching season is over with and I start my job again.

Saxophonics,3dl71g,bwanab,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:59:20 2015 UTC,I bought an new otto link about a year ago around that $250 range and I'm pretty sure the prices haven't gone up since then. The only thing is that newer Links are pretty bad in the consistency department. You just have to try as many as you can and find one that works best for you!
Saxophonics,3dl71g,Lefthandedmidget,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:15:39 2015 UTC,"New otto-links don't really compare to the vintage ones. Two boutique lines that you might look at that get close to your price range: 10mfan , which I highly recommend as I've started using the HR Robusto more than my Link STM. The other (which I haven't tried, but is reviewed here is the RS Berkeley Chris Potter Legends Series. It is literally a replica of Chris Potter's personal STM.  These are both in the $400 range.

Was sceptical about plastic clip at first, but after a few sessions I started to trust it (as much as I trust any other clip/strap).  One thing is that I had to be a bit creative with the strap adjustment - it seems like it wants to be centered on the chest, but I like it more side-slung.  I made it work.  And I find it comfortable for as long as I ever typically play continuously."

Saxophonics,3di9rz,NEPat10,5,Thu Jul 16 14:19:31 2015 UTC,"As someone in sales, I'll disagree on including them together.   The person buying this is the beginner.  They or their parents won't understand the true value of the mouthpiece and won't want to pay what they should for it.   They'll just look up your horn on eBay and say that yours is more expensive.   If the regulation was good and the cork was fixed,  you'd be able to sell that for at least $500, and as much as $700.   Sell the mouthpiece separately on Amazon and you'll get your money out of that. We sell on Amazon all the time. It's a lot easier than eBay and you can generally get more.   Find a local music store and see if they sell on consignment. They may ask you to take less, maybe $400."
Saxophonics,3di9rz,jimmybusta,2,Thu Jul 16 15:42:04 2015 UTC,That's an solid intermediate horn.  You can sell for several hundred.  You'll lose some since it needs a little work.  Or you can get the work done first and then sell for more.   I guarantee your neighbor will know of someone who is interested in it.  And will definitely have a recommendation for a reliable repair tech if you choose to fix it first.  Best bet is just to include those mouthpieces with the sale and charge a little more.  It's really not worth the trouble to sell those relatively cheap mouthpieces individually.
Saxophonics,3di9rz,ilikemyteasweet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:32:17 2015 UTC,Have your neighbor look at it then shoot me a PM.  A friend of mine is looking for a horn for his son.    Where about are you (and the horn) located?

If I were you I'd sell the saxophone with the Yamaha mouthpiece and sell the s80 separately. On a side note, I have a stock Yamaha 4C mouthpiece for alto and I think it's quite good for coming with the instrument. Your neighbor should be able to tell you a good price for what you have, that'd be a good place to start.  Regardless, you can get way more than $100 for what you have, like some other comments said up to $700 or so.

Saxophonics,3dgqnv,DualAxes,2,Thu Jul 16 03:44:53 2015 UTC,"That's actually a really good idea.  The thing has been sitting for so long, who knows how many of the pads are FUBAR."
Saxophonics,3dgqnv,DualAxes,2,Thu Jul 16 04:04:09 2015 UTC,Yes. Even a slight leak makes playing really frustrating. I have a saxophone that has a huge leak in low B. The thing is hanging wide open. I can close it with enough pinky finger pressure but that's not healthy.
Saxophonics,3dgqnv,Khamelyon,2,Thu Jul 16 04:19:43 2015 UTC,You've probably got a leaky pad somewhere. Same thing happened to me when I picked up the sax again after a 10 year hiatus (though I switched to alto from tenor). Showed my instructor what was happening and he said it sounded like there was a leak. He let me try his sax and I could get those low notes out with ease. Got my rental repaired and had no problems afterwards.
Saxophonics,3dgeiy,wrongnoteseverywhere,5,Thu Jul 16 01:47:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, sooo.... this is gonna be long.    Top Tones is not a traditional method book.  Top Tones is not a book about playing altissimo.  It's a roadmap to the technique necessary to playing altissimo, along with a developing high quality tone,  and musicianship.    The first altissimo exercises should be  built upon. It may take you months to get that first half page down. And that's okay.    Taking a step back, the first third of that book shouldn't be taken lightly.  It's not about the fingerings.  They're easy.  It's all interval work. Nothing fancy.  Your focus should be on tone quality, smooth transitions, intonation,   and internalizing the pitches. All those things that make music,  not just finger wiggling.  In his instructions to several sections,  Rascher mentions months (Page 10). That's right,  months.  Focusing on one aspect of your playing for those exercises for months.  Rascher wasn't just good. He wrote the book on what the modern saxophone can do.   Go through the first third of the book again.  Slowly. Maybe you're a prodigy who play the Ferling book in a month. The goal of Top Tones isn't to reach the end.  Focus on tone, the attack of each note you play,  how you release each note,  and getting the timbre of each note as close as you can to the previous one.    You can work the overtone exercises concurrently.  If you've never worked on it before,  that's cool. It will be slow going.  Accept it. People work on this skill for years.  This will be a long haul learning process.    If you've never worked altissimo before,  you shouldn't look past page 12 yet.  You should spend weeks on each line, not get it right once and move on.  Tone,  timbre,  attack,  release,  and breath control should all be worked on here.  When you can do a line consistently at 90%, then move on and add a bit,  but never stop working on those beginning lines.  Feel free to ask more questions and check out saxontheweb.net for more info than you will ever absorb.  EDIT : the picture you include is going to be,  and probably should be,  8-12 months down the line, maybe more. You may get the notes out before then,  awesome.  But making it sound good,  and as natural as the true is as important.   EDIT 2: I don't care about setup.  Shouldn't be important, in my opinion.  You need to comfortable,  and using the setup you'd play for performance.  Don't change anything to make this easier."
Saxophonics,3dgeiy,ilikemyteasweet,2,Thu Jul 16 02:29:37 2015 UTC,"Months? Haha what have I gotten myself into. This book had a Mr. Miyagi tone to it, but this is far worse than waxing cars. How are so many people able to do overtones at all?  And you're right, I didn't grab Top Tones expecting to learn altisimo. I went to it because I couldn't play any overtones at all, and I tried numerous false fingerings for notes that are supposedly ""easy"" all to no avail. I knew I had to rework something but I didn't know what. Mind you I don't have any private teachers, I'm just doing this on my own time.  Here's what I've been doing:   I've been treating the exercises from the first 1/3rd of the book as long-tones for my first hour of practice. It really made me realize how little I was supporting my upper register because I could only play through about 10 minutes of the long tones before my embrochure began to fell apart. And it hurts! Even when I'm doing these at modest pace of 60 bpm with a bar of rest inbetween - is this still too fast? When will I know when to move on?"
Saxophonics,3dgeiy,ilikemyteasweet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"The more you play, the stronger the muscles around your mouth ( your embouchure) will become.  Take a 10 minute break every hour of practice, too.  Good approach for the beginning of the book, too.  Remove any tempo settings you're giving yourself for now. It's not a focus here.  Be sure to take time to work on the 5 aspects Rascher lists in page 10.  For the overtone exercises,  work only that first line (3 measures - Bb fundamental,  B fundamental,  and C).  Don't go past there until you're confident on all 3 pitches in that triad. - C will be a little tricky - it's harder than B or Bb because of the physics of the sax.     make sure you're not removing and re-seating your mouth on each pitch.  Goal should be to do it all with the same embouchure ( and to play the whole normal range of the horn without changing it,  too.) what will change is the internal shape of your mouth and throat cavity. That's what will make the subtle changes to the airflow that define timbre and tone. Again,  long haul work.   When you're comfortable with that first line, add the next measure. measure. Not line. There's no shame in working this slowly. No timetable.   It's not like fingering exercises.    You'll get there."
Saxophonics,3dgeiy,ilikemyteasweet,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:19:11 2015 UTC,"Okay I'm curious. Why are the C partials harder than the rest? I took second semester physics and read Larry Teals book so I know a few thing, you can be concise.  And how much importance should I take on singing? I opted to not take ear training/sight singing class so it is a bit of a weakness for me.  Thanks again man, you've been more helpful it is usually here."
Saxophonics,3dgeiy,Allalison,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:25:56 2015 UTC,"It's not my strongest thing either. Don't kill yourself with it. As long as you can hear the pitch in your head,  I don't worry about vocalizing it.  Most of its falsetto for me,  which no one needs to hear."
Saxophonics,3dgeiy,audiate,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:32:42 2015 UTC,"You know, I've never had trouble with the C partials, so ymmv.  It probably has to do with the length and shape of tubing that is available to resonate when playing C vs B vs Bb.   The singing is extremely important.....all of these overtone changes should happen inside your throat/mouth.  Keep your chin flat (no bunching) and embouchure firm......and play/sing the 4ths 5ths exercise every day. If you are biting to get the overtones, you are doing yourself a disservice."
Saxophonics,3d71ot,BubuChan,3,Tue Jul 14 00:52:35 2015 UTC,"Oh cool! This seems like a pretty nuanced ""what should my career be?"" kind of question, so I don't think I would be able to adequately help you decide whether music ed is truly right for you but here are some things worth thinking about.  Music Ed faces a lot of similar problems that other education fields face. Typically, it takes a lot of expensive schooling for not-so-much pay. On top of this, music ed can be somewhat competitive as it is one of the most typical ""day jobs"" for career musicians. This is not to say that you won't be successful, but it will take a lot of work and experience to be a competitive candidate so do make sure that you are indeed passionate about music!  One generalization I've found among Music Ed majors is a lack of emphasis on mastering your instrument. To be competent and hirable, you will need to both be an experienced teacher (which you seem to have quite an edge) and you will need to be an proficient musician. You will not only have to develop an intensive practice routine, but you will also need to learn how to practice and learn effectively. This will be extra-difficult in Music Ed as you will need to split time with more education-oriented courses that Performance majors don't need to take.  It seems that you are passionate about classical wind ensemble or symphonic-type groups. This is great! Everyone has their preferred musical contexts, but do keep in mind, there will definitely be an emphasis on solo performance and conducting so it's important to be comfortable with them (perhaps you are already!). Also, keep in mind that becoming acquainted and proficient in jazz/improvisational music both increases your depth of understanding of music and makes you much more marketable.  It definitely isn't for everyone! I actually switched FROM Music Education to Environmental Science because I wanted to be able to take classes where I was excited to learn the material instead of just getting credentials for a job. There's definitely no shame in being a hobbyist these days and specializing in a different field."
Saxophonics,3d71ot,sedging,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:21:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your detailed response! You brought up a lot of good points that I haven't really considered. I'm not quite comfortable with solo performance, and conducting I have 0 experience. Are people applying to Music Ed programs supposed to have all this experience? My main concern is that I mainly pursued music as a hobby and didn't continue throughout all my schooling, so my skills and knowledge maybe aren't where they should be for a potential program candidate. Where should I be level wise? What is expected from a person applying to a music ed. program?  I just recently came back to music as a hobby, but our practice sessions are what I look forward to the most every week. I was considering combining this hobby with my love for teaching."
Saxophonics,3d71ot,SaxMaan,4,Tue Jul 14 01:33:04 2015 UTC,"Hello, Music Ed graduate/saxophonist here, let me answer some questions.  Most incoming college students have never conducted an ensemble in their life. Some have gotten to lead warm-ups/do pep band, but that isn't really the same. Don't worry about your lack of conducting experience, you take courses for that. If you want to get a feel for it, share your dreams with your community band instructor and see if they would give you some help and maybe let you in front of the band. In my experience, I didn't do any conducting until my classes called for it.  You are probably going to need to be at a higher level of playing than you are at now, but don't let that discourage you. You will be at college learning how to practice/get better at saxophone. The big advantage you have is that you have kept up with your playing all these years. Your next step is to get a private teacher who has experience with classical saxophone (good luck) and take some lessons from them. It doesn't need to be a big long commitment. I bet you could get college ready in three months with proper instruction and focused practice (notice I didn't say a lot.) Pick out some audition repertoire with your teacher that would be good for you. Oftentimes colleges will put up their audition requirements on their website too.  What is expected from you? A lot. I'll give you an overview for my school.  -3 years of once a week, half hour lessons. You start ""100 level"" lessons. At the end of each quarter/semester there is a formal performance called a ""jury"" where you and your accompanist perform for a panel of the woodwind faculty and they give you super critical feedback on your playing.  -One recital, usually in your senior year. My school made the minimum to be a half hour recital, but many people usually do one hour of music.   -Two years of music theory, one year of music history, and some upper division stuff (world music, orchestration, counterpoint, it's a little more unique to the school here.) I can go into more detail if you want.  -Piano proficiency. It's expected that music education students know how to play piano. You take one class (mine was a year long sequence) and then you take a 'proficiency test' with the piano teacher. Do not let your piano skills go by the wayside. Many, many schools want you to know how to play piano, even if you will never use it in your classroom. It's also an amazing instrument, one that you will really grow to respect if you take this time.  -Education courses. In my program the music department and the education department are separate. I took classes like Assessment, Classroom Management, Education Law, and others that were completely separate from the music department. These are important. Some music ed students will try to convince you that they are a ""waste of time"" and that they ""don't pertain to the major."" Don't associate with those people, they will only bring you down because they want to spend time bitching and shutting their ears instead of realizing the value of these courses. But that's a different rant for a different day.  I'll stop here for now. There's more to tell, but I don't want to overwhelm. Feel free to PM me or just respond here, I promise I won't sugarcoat anything."
Saxophonics,3d71ot,djcookie187187187187,2,Tue Jul 14 03:50:38 2015 UTC,"I did two years of accounting and finance and decided to switch to Music Ed. I never had a teacher before college either, so I emailed the saxophone professor and asked to meet him and we had a discussion about my possible future and my passion, etc. He set me up with secondary lessons (lessons for non-majors) for the audition and that helped me tremendously.  Just sit in the practice room and do work. Age is just a number."

Saxophonics,3d7sxs,ldsuckers,3,Tue Jul 14 04:35:19 2015 UTC,I'm in high school right now and I've been playing for 6 years. One of my first tenor mouthpieces was a yamaha 4C. They are very cheap as far as mouthpieces go and is a very good starter mouthpiece. As for reeds I use rico plasticovers for jazz on an aaron drake and the reeds last quite a while. Ive also tried out bari reeds but I prefer the ricos. Good luck on finding some equipment:)

The C* may be sub-par for the others, but it's pretty decent for tenor. Especially for marching band - not too shallow so you can open up and get a big enough sound."

My current marching set up is a Legere 3 strength synthetic reed or Vandoren blue box 3 strength with a Rovner ligature and c* mouthpiece. I personally find this to be a very flexible set up being it can either be super bright and jazzy, or decently warm and mellow. I mainly play Bari though (some are surprised by this setup) but my Bari setup is a BL3 with Vandoren blue box 4 strength reeds. I personally don't like the 4c mouth pieces due to them being very easy to chip and break, especially when they are gonna be used outside and banged around."
Saxophonics,3d7sxs,Yogi_Asian,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:28:26 2015 UTC,"The Yamaha 4C is weak. Order a Rico Metallite from Amazon (or where ever). They're around 30 bucks, plenty of power, reed friendly. Also, try out some synthetic reeds, they last a looong time and don't get messed up by the elements, perfect for playing outside in a marching band. I use Legere Signatures and they work great for me. Good luck!

Saxophonics,3d7sxs,trollmaster5000,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:03:13 2015 UTC,"If you are careful, you can afford to buy a half decent mouthpiece much nicer than a 4C. A rousseau NC4 and a Légère makes a y23 play amazingly. For alto anyway, my section leaders, and soon myself, recommend these tremendously. An $80-90 mouthpiece is a hefty investment as an entering freshman, but it makes your life so much more enjoyable. Being to play around well with your saxophone with your friends in marching band is an awesome experience."

Saxophonics,3d5a6k,cannontk,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:48:31 2015 UTC,"How so? Alto is transposing, pitched in Eb, and reads treble clef. Doesn't trombone read concert bass clef?"
Saxophonics,3d5a6k,Zaidswith,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:47:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that's what makes it possible for the instruments to read each others parts (without changing the clef). A C on a treble clef staff is an E on a bass clef staff. A C on alto is a concert Eb (1/2 step down from the bass clef note). You only need to change the key signature either down a Major 6th ,or up a minor 3rd (add 3 sharps, or subtract 3 flats) and the notes will play the same (disregarding the clef)."
Saxophonics,3d5a6k,nightcloudd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:39:17 2015 UTC,This was a fantastic discovery for freshman year me. I learned saxophone specifically for marching band since I was a bassoon player and I quickly learned to transpose like this in order to play whatever music I had on whatever instrument I was currently playing.
Saxophonics,3d5a6k,Lefthandedmidget,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense. You'd still need to transpose the part though, but you can just read bass clef as treble."

Saxophonics,3d5a6k,wamkabam,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:36:19 2015 UTC,"I'd play an alto at first purely because of cost. It's much easier (in my experience) to find a solid, used alto than a tenor. But as someone else said Tenor parts and trombone parts are often very alike, but not always exact. I'm a tenor myself (hate alto) but starting on was a better choice for me. That and reeds are cheaper alto most of the time but prices go up and down constantly. Also, some repairs get more expensive when you're not dealing with an alto so that is something to consider.  But it's really whatever you like. If you like how tenor sounds, go for it. It's whatever you want...and can afford... Honestly, it's all about bari. My heart yearns to play one once again. A bit of hard question since I really enjoy playing alto, soprano, bari, and tenor.  edit: Are you self teaching?"

Commonly, orchestras don't carry a saxophone chair because of the limited established repertoire.  If there are community bands in your area that don't have saxophone positions, something fishy is going on there (unless it's a brass band or something, but trust me, they would let you know.)   Any particular reason why you don't want to do jazz? I promise I won't try to convert you, but the reality of the world is that there are more people wanting to hear Basie than Bozza."

The reason I i'm not looking for a jazz band is I have the opportunity to play with my teacher's big band, and sometimes I like a change of style."
Saxophonics,3d7191,SaxMaan,2,Tue Jul 14 03:58:36 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate on ""tailored to the younger generation""? Is it an actual youth ensemble, or is it a community band with younger members in it?   The old saying is true. It's not what you know, it's who you know. The way you get involved with different organizations is by knowing people in those organizations, and that means connecting and networking and putting yourself out there. You said your teacher has a big band? I guarantee that some of those cats in that band play in other groups, and I bet at least one of them plays in a community wind band. And if you're a nice guy with a personality and an ego in check, I bet they'd love to have you.  It sounds like you either need to expand your search/willingness to travel or bite the bullet and join a band you might be lukewarm on. You never know, you may end up loving the ""younger generation"" band!"
Saxophonics,3d7191,thepharce,2,Tue Jul 14 04:04:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ""younger generation"" is a fabulous band for a 6th grader, but I am going into 11th. Its not really the people, its the way it is run(basic things needing to be taught, music that is easier than schools). It is for people that are in 6th-12th. This organization is the other one, the other being a symphony that won't take saxes. I will definitely have to see if any of them are in a community band I could join, because I would love to know more people in the music field. If you have an experience with jazz combos, how do they work out? (Thank you so much for this response, it has got me thinking)"
Saxophonics,3d7191,SuperTonicV7,2,Tue Jul 14 04:12:02 2015 UTC,"Basic things are taught in every youth ensemble. Really in just about any ensemble of community musicians. Everyone there is at a different level, so review of anything is going to be needed. I wouldn't let that hinder you. (If you really wanted a challenge, you would join on a new instrument, then you'd be right at the level of the sixth graders. But I also understand the desire to play saxophone.) I would really encourage you to change your mindset about the ensemble, though. The way you're talking about it, its coming off like you think you're above the musicians in that group. You're never above a gig, man. Playing is playing is playing, especially at your age. In every group you play in, there will probably be someone better than you and probably be someone worse. Not everything you do will be this profound, impacting experience. But it's all music, and it's all fulfilling because we're playing. Keep that in mind as you explore your music career more.  Jazz combos are cool... with the right people! I'm confused by your question, though. Are you asking how jazz combos come about? If so, they come about by you getting a drummer, a bass player, and a chord player (piano or guitar), some horn players, and some music. Are you in band in school? If not, please join, they need you. Use your connections there to get your players together. The band director should have music for you, but if not let me know and we can figure something else out (I know it's summer.)   But if you're asking about the general success of jazz combos? In high school it can be tough because the skill level usually isn't there to keep things interesting enough for people to keep coming back. When music comes together and feels good, it's the best. But high school jazz combos don't always come together well because it's a lot of people's first time playing in that setting. The best way to combat this is to stick with it and keep learning together. Your drummer needs to be able to keep a groove, and your bass and chord player need to be able to play with everyone and not just for everyone, dig?  Get out there and play, man. You've got opportunities. I guarantee you won't regret taking them."

Saxophonics,3d39xs,Bebopopotamus,3,Mon Jul 13 05:42:38 2015 UTC,"Let's put it this way: if you used to be a serious cyclist and you took a hiatus for 13 years, you'd still remember how to ride a bike, but you'd definitely be out of shape. It would take a fair amount of training to get back up to speed, but at least you'd remember some things about effective training techniques.  I (regrettably) took a break from saxophone for about eight years after I left college. Picking it back up again wasn't too bad, but it took a while before I felt like I was progressing beyond where I had left off. My embouchure stamina was decreased, but it came back surprisingly quickly. Some finger motions were very familiar (e.g. chromatic scale, certain melodic licks, etc.) but others had pretty thoroughly faded and took a while to relearn (e.g. the less commonly-used arpeggios).  I'm glad I picked it back up and started throwing myself into (low pressure) performance situations, whether I felt ready or not. It really drove me to get back on a fairly disciplined practice schedule and recover my lost skills. I've been back in the saddle for a couple years and although I'm still far from being an expert, I like to think that I'm making real progress.  So, don't be afraid to get back on the bike. You'll probably quickly realize how much you missed it and how much you still know. I hope this helps, and welcome back to the club!"
Saxophonics,3d39xs,Desidiosus,2,Mon Jul 13 06:14:47 2015 UTC,"Great prices for the repairs, and six weeks isn't that long of a wait for the soprano. You'll get the alto back in a week or so, so you'll have something to get re-started on.    As far as the ""riding a bike"" analogy... Yes and no. You're going to be very rusty after such a long absence. Like a bike, you'll be able to balance yourself and stay on two wheels, but don't expect a century tour in your near future. Start working on scales and etudes to build back your stamina, see a saxophone teacher for some lessons, and keep your eyes on what you want to accomplish.

Lol I'm really excited for it. After my divorce my then-girlfriend was hanging out at my house and I thought I'd show her my guitars.

It took a very short time, honestly, to get up to the level of amateur playing I enjoyed back in school.  Over the years since, playing with some real musicians, I like to think that I have grown far beyond my pre-hiatus skills."
Saxophonics,3d39xs,ilovetohappen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:29:01 2015 UTC,It sounds like you are interested and passionate.  I revisited my saxophone after several years of downtime and it was exciting.  Of course my technique and embochure and all that had grown lax with neglect.  But it was still thrilling to run a few scales and read sheet music again.    There is no secret to improving on sax or anything else - spend time with it and study/practice mindfully.  If you are coming back after an absence then you have the strength of knowing just how much you enjoy it and miss it and want to make it a part of your life again.  Happy trails!

I started in VA at first grade and we moved to GA in 5th grade.  They don't start band here until 6th so when they were all brand new beginners I was a leg up on everybody and I was always 1st chair throughout school.  I absolutely love saxophone.  Fun fact: I got to play a kickass improv solo during ""Takin' Care of Business"" in high school jazz band for the Duke of Edinburgh when he visited ""slumberland"" mattress factory in GA. Was awesome. Anyway yes I can't wait for my horns."

Sometimes I replace that by a endless chorus over a Blues grid played by my Computer.  Just to keep having fun with my horn.   And sometimes i put an high G on my blues Chorus and it sound so much better that 3 month before so I'm happy  Or Sometimes the end of my super piano Bach piece in the low range of my horn have nice sound and I'm happy"
Saxophonics,3d26qb,Kramalimedov,2,Mon Jul 13 06:29:03 2015 UTC,"Scales- major, melodic minor, harmonic minor to start. First learn your major scales. Don't focus so much on what notes are in each scale but how each scale sounds. And how does that sound feel on your horn. Scale practice is about developing your hand/ear coordination. Once you're able to play your major scales up and down, start working on the modes, triads, sevenths, digital patterns, etc. then apply the same process to be minor scales. Highly recommend Jerry Cokers patterns for jazz. Theory-The jazz theory book by Mark Levine covers most of the theory you'll need to become a great improvisor with real examples from the pros. Also check out Jerry Cokers Developing a jazz language. Playing melodically- listen,listen, and then listen. Start singing simple nursery rhymes and then figure them out on your horn. Most are very scaler and easy to figure out. Then try other melodies from jazz standards. You must be able to sing it perfectly before you try to figure it out on your horn. Listen to Lester Young, Ben Webster, Stan Getz solos. Listen to how each line relates to the previous line and sometimes to the melody."

Learn chords.   You're always playing within some kind of framework, i.e. a scale or a chord progression that incorporates more than one scale.   The question of how to improvise comes up a lot here, and it makes me wonder if people are putting too much emphasis on learning compositions, i.e. to replay something, and not enough on practicing scales."

What are you going to do when you're in the chair and the first chart is a barn burner that you have the solo on? My primary advice would be to play a lot less than you think you need to. In fast tunes, with the adrenaline flowing, it's so tempting to think that you need to be burning and burning when in reality, providing space allows your solo to develop much more."

Saxophonics,3cylu7,lbcsax,7,Mon Jul 13 01:34:30 2015 UTC,"What's always helpful for me when soloing is to keep the theme of the piece in mind, relate it into your own life, bracket the chords, and know the form like the back of your hand. Add soloing over the chart to a 30 minute slot of your hour or so you already practice a day. Take patterns you might know or be familiar with, take the rhythm and change the notes, or take the notes and change the rhythm, quote the melody, do whatever you want. Don't feel like you have to solo like bird if you don't want to, play 200 like a 100. Really, in the end, it's all up to you. Just giving things that I do and like hearing in solos."
Saxophonics,3cylu7,OrdinaryGamer12,3,Sun Jul 12 05:10:53 2015 UTC,"You should really think about what you are proposing. You know what the audition is asking for and you want to see if you can cheat. If that is going to be your attitude in college you probably won't have a good experience. You are there to learn, not be in groups your aren't actually qualified for.  It's fine as an exercise to write out a solo, in fact write out several. That is a time honored method to learn the improv process. When the time comes show them an honest representation of what you do, you will feel so much better failing with integrity than succeeding with deception."
Saxophonics,3cylu7,v-b,6,Sun Jul 12 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"I don't really think you should ever really completely improvise a solo.  I believe Jeff Coffin once said that he has certain things and that he wants to hit during his solos but he improvised to get to those points,not everything comes off the top of his head.    Sit down in your practice room and just find somethings that sound really good, or listen to some of the greats and take their ideas, then figure where to insert them into your solo and improvise until that point.  Hope that helps a bit!"
Saxophonics,3cylu7,SuperTonicV7,2,Sun Jul 12 02:51:06 2015 UTC,"All the above comments said, it would still be a good exercise for you to write out a solo of your own creation. You may find certain licks work together well, or develop a good pacing / structure for the tune, or an outline of a solo you can draw on in the audition room... I would consider this to be preparation, not cheating."
Saxophonics,3cylu7,SuperTonicV7,2,Sun Jul 12 17:20:52 2015 UTC,"Writing out a solo as an exercise? Sure - That's actually a really good thing to do. Trains your mind to work with your ears when a horn isn't in your hands.  Doing so in an audition? Big mistake.   You'll be misrepresenting yourself. ""Hey, that solo in your audition was killer. Now you're going to be our go-to guy for improv solos. Here, take this next chorus of rhythm changes."" Does this sound like a situation you want to be in? As others have said, it's easy for someone on an audition panel to spot the guy who is playing something from memory. All it takes is for them to sit down at the piano and keep playing the tune until you run out of ideas. Again, does this sound like a situation you want to be in? Sounds pretty damned awkward to me.   Just be honest. You're going to be a freshman. Worst case scenario? You don't make the band, you practice hard, and make it next year.   Other possible outcomes:   a) You make the band, but sit second alto. Not near as many solos as lead alto, which itself has nowhere near as many solos as lead tenor.  b) You don't make the band, but perhaps the university has a tiered jazz program. Is there a second jazz band? There's no shame, particularly for a freshman, in being in the second group. It's a great place to get your feet wet and learn.  Re: Hearing ""The Greats"" play similar solos in various performances, there could be a myriad of reasons for this perception. Many of the greats have such distinctive styles that you can hear some of their favorite licks in many of their recordings. Parker had a bunch of them. Also, many of the older bands (think Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller) were popular bands. Their music was played by households across the world - People went nuts for them. Their audience grew accustomed to these recorded solos. As such, people like Jimmy Blanton, Johnny Hodges, Cootie Williams, Sam Nanton.... They often played the same solo, as their audience would be expecting it. Not only that, but when one of these guys would leave the band, the next guy was expected to learn that same solo in order to keep continuity for the listener.  This all pretty much went away with bebop and more straight-ahead jazz. You'd be hard-pressed to find any of the greats after the 50's and 60's playing the same stuff verbatim.  Wow, this really became a wall of text. Sorry about that. Long story short, do your best to improvise. Even if you fall on your face in the audition, if your sound is great and you swing, the audition panel will notice."

Aside from that, I'd recommend recording yourself, so that if you hear yourself making a tone you don't like, you can take some measures to correct it.     But honestly, nothing beats a focused session in the practice room. Older guys than me call it ""wood-shedding"" or ""paying your dues"". Get focused, get help from your teacher/professor, and spend the time to knock that shit out.     Also, when someone asks you to jam with them at their place, you say ""Yes"". When someone asks you to join their band, you say ""Yes"". When someone asks you to help them, you say ""Yes"".     Play as often as you can, and practice your scales/etudes/literature as often as you can. I knew a guy who (in my opinion) didn't really have an ""ear"" for music. Couldn't sing, couldn't play in tune, etc. But one day, he decided to drop everything and spend all of his spare time in the practice room. He became a monster.

It has features such as tempo, gradual increase/decrease, beats per bar and clicks per beat. You can also tap a tempo and it'll start playing that tempo. I use it to practice scales and triplet feel. Also just good for practicing songs."
Saxophonics,3cpjg0,Gogge26,2,Thu Jul 9 19:31:39 2015 UTC,"EUMLab has GREAT music apps. I use insTuner and Metronome. I went pro on both because they're just so useful. Features I find most useful?  insTuner:  Tone Producer-if you have earbuds or amplification, pitch-matching is way better than a tuner. Choose Sine, Square, Tri, or Saw. Octaves 0-8. Watch your ears.  Strobe Tuner-It actually works well. More accurate than just the needle.  Spectogram-Old school, yo.  Historical Curve-You can close your eyes, play the note, then look at the graph to see where it was and how it changed over time. This keeps you unbiased while making your true tuning chart. Automatically starts tracking over when you change notes. Very, very useful.  FFT-See how clearly your overtones are ringing. Choose log, linear, or note display.  Standard-The needle everyone is used to. Shows cents in either direction.  Quick Tuner-My favorite. Lights the whole screen green when you're right, red when you're not (and in the direction you're not, of course). Nice and quick.  Holds Pitch-The last tuning stays displayed until you play another note, so you don't have to have you eyes on it all the time. If you question where that last note was, it's still showing after you stop.  Needle Damping-Adjust how sensitive the needle is.  Transposition-You shouldn't use this, but it's there. Transpose in your head.  Metronome:  Obvious Met Features-It beeps in time. It doesn't distort the time when you lock your device or go to a different app that doesn't take over the audio.  13 Tones and Mute-Hear it or just watch.  Customizable Visual Block-It's pretty nice if you play something like drums where it's easier to watch a met than hear it. Has a pendulum mode. Shows up HUGE in landscape.  Rhythm Trainer-COOLEST FEATURE!!! It automatically speeds up after a specific number of measures. Set a target tempo and the ratio of practice tempos, then you're off. It keeps steady one you've reached target until you stop the met. I can't applaud this feature enough, and it's way more in-depth than just that. There's also a warm-up option which increases by time so you can do a timed warm-up routine.  Subdivisions-Eighths, triplets, sixteenths, last two triplets, swing, first two triplets, upbeats. There's also a polyrhythm switch for even MORE options. You'll likely never be done exploring this app.  Individually-Adjustable Time Signatures-You don't pick from stupid presets. Pick the top and bottom number separately. Infinite possibilities for time signatures.  Three Accent Variations-Make some beats a different pitch so you can always tell which beat you're on.  Vibration-I'm pretty certain it does this, but I've never used it.  I may have even missed or forgotten some of the features. Both of these apps have been WAY worth it. I'm super-stingy with app purchases, so take this as a heavy recommendation. I also use iRealb really often. A PDF reader is essential and DropBox is the way to go for sending out and receiving charts to practice. I use Skype and FaceTime for lessons frequently, as well as Facebook messenger video chat.

If you can solo over a tune without a rhythm section and people can still tell what the chords are, you really know the tune.

You can test it by putting your thumb on the F# key to force it closed instead of the thumb rest. I've really only had the issue when really blowing hard though. But gurgling is really common on sopranos, especially Selmers. I honestly wouldn't say that its a common issue on altos, at least not in my experience. Did your tech change anything else? Also, how far are you pushed in? I have played around with pulling out really far on my Yamaha alto and it will warble like that, but I have to be really far out on the cork. In my experience on Selmer sopranos the issue disappears if you push in far enough. It puts me at like 30+ cents sharp, but no more warble! Obviously it isn't practical to play this way though. I have heard that it is often times a neck issue, and the soprano warble can often be fixed by stretching the neck. I don't have any personal experience with this, but that's what I've heard."

If the cork is conical (like the neck taper) and the interior of the mouthpiece shank is cylindrical, you'll get extra space inside the chamber/shank area that can lead to burbles down low.  Put your mouthpiece about 1/8"" on to the cork.  Does it fit well?  Or does the end of the neck cork knock around inside the shank with lots of extra space?    Something I wrote in this sub probably 5 days ago: ""loose neck cork adds volume inside the mouthpiece chamber by leaving empty space between inside of mouthpiece shank and end of cork, results vary (intonation, burbles down low, etc.) but are almost always undesirable. cork should be cylindrical not conical to avoid this- neck is conical though, so cork must be shaped after being installed, which is 99% of the skill in applying one. tape works temporarily (usually people use teflon/ptfe tape rather than masking tape), but the neck should be recorked which is not expensive nor difficult (though we've all seen some corks which witness otherwise for some people)"""

Saxophonics,3cmrip,fixessaxes,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:55:10 2015 UTC,"Okey doke.  If that's not it- which hopefully it is because its a simple fix- its probably just a leak somewhere and you might have to get a second opinion to find it.  What kind of alto do you have?    I wouldn't freak out, either.  There are very few horns that do that as a matter of course, and even then it can be fixed.  But since yours didn't start out that way, you are probably just a bit of sleuthing away from getting it back to normal."

However that doesn't mean the mouthpiece is unplayable but it may make some reeds underperform. Just contact Theo Wanne and I'm sure they'll be happy to fix it for you."
Saxophonics,3ck2g4,lejazzvp,6,Wed Jul 8 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"Yep- the way the dent is, it'll probably need to be filled with some silver solder, then carefully filed back down to flat."

Your job is to learn to hear those patterns, be able to play them, and put them into your improvisations whenever you think they fit. A fun thing about patterns is that you can pass them off over a ton of changes because they make sense melodically, even if they don't match the sonority, so they still sound good as long as you finish somewhere sensible.

I bought it for its loudness. I got it for 4.5k but it was a newish one in extremely good shape. It is loud but not in an amplified electric guitar way, but in a resonant way. So it can play softly. I tried it next to selmer series II's and III's and some yamaha customs but the reference stood out to me. Because it is a ""jazz horn"" (a remake of the mark VI) it would definitely fare well in other genres.   I will comment that yamahas are also good. My tenor is a YTS-62 and it definitely plays, but isn't special. Being special isn't important to everyone but it kind of is to me. I like the loudness of the reference, and the darkness of my yani soprano. Think about what you want in your alto maybe besides it being good for all genres.  edit: oh, also, if you are looking for a dark horn, I would check out Keilwerth (sp?).

Selmer Paris is also another really nice brand, but they can be tremendously expensive. The one thing I will add is that personally, I would not even think about looking into an intermediate horn. Although they are quite cheap, you're eventually going to want to upgrade to a professional horn, making you're intermediate horn obsolete.

I bought it used about 2 years ago and it's still in absolutely perfect alignment, and the seller claims it was never serviced.  And it went through the mail to get to me.  It's in better shape than my Yanagisawa soprano after a professional tune-up.  And like I said, it's very even over its entire range.  The low notes don't honk too bad, and it's easy to get a consistent tone from low D to palm F#.  I suck at altissimo so I can't really comment on that.

They're made to last, play just as well as my Selmers, and are significantly more affordable.

Saxophonics,3c0jz1,fixessaxes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:44:14 2015 UTC,I'm giving crowdfunding a try to fast-track my work of making videos and writing articles by asking you guys donate a bit to give me some time off my regular sax repair job to focus. Share this link if you are a believer.  This stuff will get done eventually regardless; it is my mission. But a couple weeks of doing nothing but videos and articles would easily fast-forward it by a couple years.
Saxophonics,3c107i,RamaLama787,7,Fri Jul 3 19:47:56 2015 UTC,"Former All State Bari Player (Mississippi 2014). What worked for me was spending 2 hours EVERYDAY, two months leading up to my audition, practicing. I would spend 10-15 minutes warming with Long Tones, Scales in 5ths, Chromatic exercises, and my Symphonic Band warm-up chorale. Then, I would tune my horn with both low and middle F#.  Then I would run all 12 major scales full range, tongue up slur down, (audition requirement) with a metronome at 160. Run the chromatic scale in triplets full range of the horn at the same speed. I would recommend learning the alternate, chromatic fingerings to use during your scales and etudes. During the 2nd round of my audition, I had one of the five judges watch my fingerings the whole time I was in the room. She never looked at the music. Back to practicing. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you get a private lesson instructor, if you have not already. Having that one-on-one attention from someone who has conquered harder music than what you will audition on, is the difference between being 1st chair and just another alternate. Do what your instructor says and apply it to the last hour and a half of your practice time, which should be dedicated to just the audition music.   Go into your audition with confidence, knowing you will impress the judges with all the work you put in. Dress professionally, (shirt and tie, pressed and fitted, if your a guy, or a modest Sunday dress with flats if your a girl, will leave a positive impression in their minds from the moment you walk into the room). Be polite and respectful to the judges. They are more likely than not, volunteering on a day off, listening to students play the same thing all day. Smile and introduce yourself when you walk in. Take your seat, sit up straight like you have been taught to, ask if it is okay to tune before you begin. They will say yes, so use that small window to hear what you will sound like in that room and adjust accordingly. Before you begin, breathe in and out slowly, to relax the nerves. Mentally tell yourself ""You got this"" and have fun playing, (judges notice when a student is enjoying playing and will think more positively of you for it). After you are done. Stand up straight, and say thank you for their time. A slight nod of the head to the head judge, will not go unnoticed. Walk out of the room confidently, showing the judges your proud of what you just did.   Once you leave the room. Breathe a sigh relief, get the spit out of your horn and go home. Keep your mind off of it, until results are posted. Be gracious regardless of the outcome. Be happy if you make it, but understand that this one audition is just that, one audition. Learn from it and do not let if define your musical career. Enjoy the experience! You will miss it when you graduate.  Hope this helps! Best of luck to you during this endeavor!"

I spent ALL my practice time on the etudes, and I spent no time on sight reading. On an instrument where they take so little chairs (basically all saxophones), sight reading matters TREMENDOUSLY. So especially if in your state they only take 1 bari sax, you will need to practice sight reading. It's what will separate you from the other people auditioning."

I just kinda wave it over the steam stream slowly so as to not burn it. Then when it swells back to its normal size, dry it off with a towel and put cork grease on it and let it sit.

However, school horns undergo a good deal more wear and tear than most privately owned horns do, so I still wouldn't be surprised if it needed adjustment. From what you've said, it sounds like it at least needs to be re-corked, so it should be taken in for that. While they're doing that, most techs will check for leaks and other little stuff as well, which could do the horn some good. Sometimes the slightest nudge can cause a leak. You might not even notice that anything's odd until much later. If you're not the only person who's used that horn recently, the chance that something's out of whack is much higher."

This is not a problem that you should fix by ""adjusting yourself"". It sounds like you were developing some very bad habits as a result of a horn that needs maintenance. Maybe think about having the techs do a general inspection of the horn to make sure the pads are in good shape and the keys are in adjustment while you have it in for the neck cork."

Saxophonics,3bk3go,captainwhatshisname,3,Tue Jun 30 13:34:03 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert, but I think it's pretty normal to adjust the mouthpiece position on the neck to bring the horn as close as possible to the right pitch for as much of the range as possible.  Because very horn plays a bit different, you'd then need to adjust some notes to the right pitch by other means.  I'd avoid using anything with adhesive though.  I've seen recommendations to just wrap a bit of regular paper to add to the thickness of material on the neck, or the cork can be replaced by a tech for a more permanent solution."
Saxophonics,3bk3go,durple,2,Mon Jun 29 21:45:32 2015 UTC,"I'd avoid using anything with adhesive though.   Eh, using something with adhesive is fine until they can get the cork replaced. As others have mentioned, this should just be a stopgap solution until they can actually get the horn in the shop. The real problem here is needing a new cork, so the old cork will just be tossed anyway (adhesive/nonadhesive won't matter).  But you are 100% correct that adjusting the mouthpiece (and occasionally the neck) is the proper way to bring the horn itself in tune, then potentially tuning adjustments with your embouchure (although this should be avoided as much as possible).   The other very possible source for intonation issues with particular notes is leaks in the pads. From the sound of it, OP's horn may not have been in the shop for a while. Leaks will cause minor intonation issues that can get worse over time, causing you to have to readjust your embouchure and creating all sorts of bad habits.  Ninja-edit: One other possibility for intonation problems is the mouthpiece itself. I have certain mouthpieces that play perfectly in tune on my alto, and others that throw certain notes way out of whack. If you're having tuning issues on your horn, you might try a new mouthpiece to see if that helps. Changing chamber size and length can help dramatically."
Saxophonics,3bk3go,mscman,2,Tue Jun 30 14:21:14 2015 UTC,"Heh, I got turned off of using anything adhesive by a bad experience.  Picked up an old-ish alto, after playing it briefly it spent a bunch of time (months) in storage.  The previous owner had added a bit of some kind of tape to the neck receiver cap so it would stay in (the case it was in had a bunch of wiggle room).  When I brought it out again to play, this ended up leaving some gunk inside the neck receiver, was a pain to get cleaned up afterwards (and needed to be cleaned, as it was just enough substance and hella sticky so the neck wouldn't properly insert).  I mean, it's not gonna do any actual damage, but it could lead to some annoyance, so given the choice between a temp fix using tape or a temp fix using a bit of paper without adhesive, I'd go without adhesive."
Saxophonics,3bk3go,durple,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:46:33 2015 UTC,"Oh putting adhesive inside the neck receiver is a bad idea. I'm just saying putting things with adhesive on the cork will not hurt anything, and might help it stick better for more uses."

Saxophonics,3bk3go,saganistic,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:35:06 2015 UTC,"answers so far seem right on.  loose neck cork adds volume inside the mouthpiece chamber by leaving empty space between inside of mouthpiece shank and end of cork, results vary (intonation, burbles down low, etc.) but are almost always undesirable.  cork should be cylindrical not conical to avoid this- neck is conical though, so cork must be shaped after being installed, which is 99% of the skill in applying one.  tape works temporarily (usually people use teflon/ptfe tape rather than masking tape), but the neck should be recorked which is not expensive nor difficult (though we've all seen some corks which witness otherwise for some people)"

My favorite mouthpiece seems to compress the cork down quite a bit after even just an hour of practice. The area on the cork where the mouthpiece is obviously a lot less thick than the area it isn't, which obviously makes the mouthpiece not fit on the end and as a result leads to poor intonation.

Experiment endlessly!   It's not that different from talking or singing, really. Lots of players and teachers say ""sing into the sax"". While you don't use your vocal cords (try it, however), there is quite a bit of overlap in your brain, with playing and singing.   There are various and several tonguing techniques, and it seems that whenever I consciously try to tongue, it's like an exercise. But when I'm warmed up and actually making some music, I hardly think of it as ""tonguing"". It's more like ""talking the notes out"".   Long tones, experiment, and listen. Some ""bad habits"", when sufficiently mastered, become ""techniques"". Feel free to enjoy and play."

The C melody tenor sax still found some use in very early jazz simply from the fact that you could read off the same lead sheet as piano without having to transpose, but even that didn't prove to be useful enough to stick.  I wouldn't call a saxophone in C or F useless, but it's certainly more of a novelty instrument at this point."
Saxophonics,3bgxev,saxguy2001,2,Mon Jun 29 13:34:07 2015 UTC,I agree with that. Some years ago there was a guy trying to get a modern C melody (tenorish) sax produced (see my other post - aquilasax).The c sop's I've seen come up on e-bay every blue moon go for about 1000 USD.

Saxophonics,3bgxev,fixessaxes,2,Mon Jun 29 16:33:01 2015 UTC,"I've worked on a few.  They seem relatively poorly made, as if they were just ticking a box and trying to get the horn out the door so they could cash in on the ongoing saxophone craze of the 1920s (remember the electric guitar craze of the 80s-90s?  there was one for saxophones in the 20s) rather than making a serious attempt a high quality instrument.  Some other weird saxophones made at the time DID feel like a serious attempt at a professional saxophone like the Conn F-Mezzo, the Conn Conn-O-Sax, the King Saxello... but the C-sopranos that I have seen (Buescher and Conn) were not something I would recommend owning.  The sound was kind of tinny, and not tonally unique enough to be interesting to me (unlike the F-mezzo or C-melody tenor, which have an obviously unique tone).    Typically you see them on ebay for $500-1500.  They are rare and not many people know that they aren't that great, so they continue to be sold to be people excited for their potential who are usually disappointed.  If you are OK with wrestling with it, the necessity for a matching C soprano mouthpiece, the fact that you'll almost certainly need to put a bunch of money into it to get it to play, and the fact that you wouldn't be able to sell it back for what you've got it into it, well then go for it.  If any of this sounds bad to you, get a later Conn C-melody tenor instead, which is a fine instrument with a beautiful tone."
Saxophonics,3bgxev,hobbycollector,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:38:29 2015 UTC,"I briefly had a C melody sax (between an alto and a tenor in size). I played it a little bit, but it's just not that hard to transpose for Tenor, which is what most people do. The sound on the C melody is distinct, but the keywork on the one I played was vintage and a little clunky. They made very few C sopranos in history. A modern company does produce a C sop for about 900 usd; I considered purchasing but as it turns out music written for sax is generally in Bb or Eb already, and it's not that hard to transpose for Bb anyway, which is my main interest. Vintage are usually about 1000 USD, modern is similar in price. I've never seen a C sop live."

Saxophonics,3bglvq,Sacados111,4,Mon Jun 29 01:23:21 2015 UTC,"Your question is too vague. There is a gazillion of so-called ""professional"" horns, mainly due to the massive flooding of the market by horns made in Taiwan. The short answer would be stick to the big 4 (Selmer, Yamaha, Yanagisawa, Keilwerth), and if buying factory new, expect the horn to need some adjustment (Yanagisawas needing less than the others, especially Selmers).  If you want to get any relevant answer, you need to give us more details: what is your current horn and what are you looking to upgrade from it by purchasing a professional saxophone? What's your budget? Does it have to be ""new"" from the factory or can it be a used / vintage model? Etc."
Saxophonics,3bglvq,lejazzvp,2,Mon Jun 29 01:33:40 2015 UTC,New or old open to both. Budget would be some around $3000 maybe $4000.   The link to my current sax  https://www.long-mcquade.com/18506/Band/Saxophones/Conn_-_Selmer_Inc/Intermediate_Alto_Sax_Outfit_-_Paris_Neck.htm.
Saxophonics,3bglvq,thesaxoman,4,Mon Jun 29 01:49:31 2015 UTC,Yamaha Custom 875EX Or Selmer Series II or III
Saxophonics,3bglvq,lejazzvp,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:55:05 2015 UTC,"Oh, wow, you're looking at many many options with this price range. /u/thesaxoman's recommendations are great.   You could get a Selmer Mark VII, which is an awesome horn although it feels slightly bigger in the hands, a Series II or II.   You could get a Yamaha YAS-875EX or 82Z which some have reported as more flexible.   You could get many different Yanagisawa models, including some of the new Wo-Series; so Yani AW01, AW02, 901, 991. ""Intermediate"" models from Yanagisawa are actually pro horns in build, intonation, sound and response, especially starting from the 9XX series.  If you end up with a Keilwerth, which some folks seem to like, just be aware that the rolled tone holes models may be more expensive to maintain or repair.  I've always preferred the midrange resonance Selmer Paris horns have but all models mentioned above have been proven and tested as pro horns. It's then a matter of personal preference. If you're going to spend $3000-$4000 on a horn, it's more than worth using a couple of hundreds from your budget to travel to a place where they have most of these horns so you can try them and decide, knowing how you sound on them, how they respond and feel. We're all different."
Saxophonics,3bglvq,jazzman317,3,Mon Jun 29 03:47:15 2015 UTC,"Be feature-minded. Brands are great, but you've got to know what you want out of a horn. If you want a great jazz horn, you're probably going to be in a slightly different market than if you're going for a career in classical sax.  You may have already been told to consider buying used. A new pro horn is definitely in your range, but used may afford you a horn slightly above that or just save you some dough for a fancy neck strap or something else to go great with your new horn. Here's something you may not have considered, however: check out the big sax repair shops. Places like Tenor Madness will sometimes turn horns around to sell for a decent price. This is probably a little more expensive than buying from Jo down the road, but they'll set up the horn before you get it, and might even adjust it exactly the way you want it. There's a reason these big shops are well-known; they do good, reputable work.  Horn finishes make a difference. Lacquer colors generally do not, but the presence of lacquer or plating does. Research the differences, because they are there. It can also be a part of your identity. I had an oddly-colored horn during public school and I can attribute that to nearly half of my reputation/recognition now after nearly a decade. Just make sure you don't suck.  Saving ~$600 on the horn puts you in position to grab up an aftermarket neck for it. These can make noticeable differences, and there are many out there. Yamaha offers a few for their 875EX and 82Z. I'll mention here that I personally play a 875EX black lacquer with custom key heights, a clear lacquer Oleg neck, and a Meyer G 7 (currently out being worked on by Jimmy Jensen in Wichita, KS). It puts out sound in truckloads. Don't worry about necks at first, though, because it's one of the smaller differences you will make to a horn you should already be really happy with. It will NOT fix a horn you're unhappy with overall. Just think about leaving your budget room for one.  Ergonomics. Vintage horns have a different feel. Be sure you'll be able to adapt to that. They also have a different intonation tendencies. Then again, so does every horn. Good luck with that. There's a whole vintage-vs-new discussion there, but all I'll say is to never buy a vintage horn without trying that horn. There are many more variances from horn to horn in vintage models than new.  Upkeep. Find people who've had these horns for a while. I've heard from a couple techs, for example, that Cannonball horns are pretty good but fall apart after a while. Damn stones must make the thing resonate right to pieces...  Shop around and be patient. Horn retailers have great deals going on constantly. Wait for one to come up on the horn you've decided on, whether it's new or used. WWBW just recently had a big used horn sale. Don't just shop online, either. The manufacturers give these retailers a minimum price they're allowed to advertise. If you call, though, they can tell about a better deal if there is one. I never make a WWBW order without calling and asking about ""phone deals"". It's saved me probably $150 over the years. I haven't even bought a horn from them. Whatever you do, don't see a horn for $3,700 and go pick it up just because it's right under your limit. Be sure it's the best price you can get from a reputable dealer.  The best thing you can do is try before you buy. You don't have to buy where you try, but definitely try. If you ignore everything else I've mentioned, go try horns.  I hope you didn't just want me to tell you what horn to buy. You'll have to find out what you really want first. Don't worry, it'll only take years to settle on the horn you'll stay with. Then, you'll change your mind again. It's the nature of the beast."
Saxophonics,3bglvq,laxpanther,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:00:37 2015 UTC,"the only thing I'll say about cannonball, and I'm not an unabashed fanboy, is that I've had a big bell alto since 2004, I abuse the crap out of it gigging, ridden hard put away wet, and the damn thing has never needed significant adjustment or work. There are minor issues (it's a bit heavier than other brands, there are some intonation issues near middle D (ok on my 2013 cball tenor), and other more minor stuff) but I'm overall very happy with the build quality. I don't care about the stones, I don't think they add anything, but I dig my horns and I played all the major and some minor brands before I purchased."

Saxophonics,3bglvq,Indeeeeed,3,Fri Jul 3 15:13:28 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything already said in this thread, but if you only take one thing away from this comment it would be to visit as many stores as you can and play every horn they'll let you touch.  My comment is targeted mostly at purchasing a new horn, but if you're considering a vintage instrument, keep in mind that you must also consider the condition of the instrument as well as the difficulties (read:$$$) that might arise in locating or fabricating parts should something need replacing. But if you fall in love with an old horn and it works for you, more power to you.   I would HIGHLY suggest you DO NOT buy your horn online. Yes, you can probably get your horn cheaper online, but even modern saxophones which are the exact same model can vary greatly for each individual instrument (especially Selmer). You don't want to buy a $4,000 instrument that you have never seen or played based purely on what some random dude on the internet suggested (I am a random dude too). With that kind of a budget, I would suggest a professional line horn from Yamaha (YAS 875EX or 82Z), Selmer (Series II or III; there are pretty significant differences between the two), or Yanagisawa (WO series, 9XX series). I suggest sticking to those brands because they are generally accepted among most saxophonists as quality instruments. Additionally, most good instrument technicians should have a fair bit of experience with those instruments so any maintenance or repairs should be fairly routine.   Find something that feels pretty good in your hands, and that you sound good on. Consider the response in all registers, tone throughout the horn, intonation etc. Once you narrow down your options some, try as many of the same model horns as you can (if a store has 10 82Z's try them all if they'll let you). My point is, every saxophone has its own unique quirks and a horn that works great for me, may be horrible for you. After you buy your horn, I would suggest you take it to a good technician and have them set it up for you.   If for whatever reason you are absolutely hellbent on ordering it online or you live in the absolute middle of nowhere and can't visit a music store that has a good selection, make sure the place you buy your instrument from has a good return policy. If your precious $4,000 baby comes in the mail and turns out to be a complete POS you're going to be upset if you can't return/exchange it.   Remember, a saxophone of this quality is a huge investment and commitment. If you take care of it and keep it properly maintained, there is no reason why it should ever be necessary to buy a new instrument during your lifetime (barring some tragedy) unless you make the choice to buy a new one."
Saxophonics,3bglvq,manofsax94,2,Mon Jun 29 07:46:33 2015 UTC,"If you are even within a days trip to Elkhart, Indiana, I would recommend paying them a visit. You can try everything they have in their warehouse (Selmers and Yanagisawas). When I bought my soprano, I was able to select it from about a dozen Series III's, and the facility has an excellent repairman on hand to make any adjustments you need.  More generally, just try out absolutely everything you can. Four grand is a huge commitment to make for an instrument, so you may as well spend a lot of time researching and trying everything out. If you're anywhere in the Ohio area, I can give you a couple other locations to try out plenty of horns.   Also, if you're willing to wait until next spring, the biennial North American Saxophone Alliance National Conference is being held at Texas Tech University in March of 2016. When I attended the 2014 National Conference, they had upwards of 150 horns set up from multiple vendors. That's the best place to try as many different things out as possible. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions.   Hope that helped!"
Saxophonics,3bglvq,Dominic11112,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:59:58 2015 UTC,"Jazz and classical? That is a Selmer, not the best in either field but bloody brilliant all the same in both. If you prefer jazz you can pick up a Mark VI alto for 3000-4000, don't worry about the serial number just buy one that plays. If classical is preferred then you could settle for a newer model, buy secondhand though is my advice as it is much more cost effective. If classical is reaaalllyyy your thing there are some other brands that they prefer, although less versatile, Buffet comes to mind. If you spot an SML it will compete with the Selmer too, although much cheaper they don't show up that often."

Saxophonics,3bbpul,trollmaster5000,5,Sat Jun 27 20:39:03 2015 UTC,"I second the Legere suggestion. I use a signature cut on my AL3 which works fantastically, but I have found that some Legeres are better than others (can't escape some inconsistencies even with synthetic reeds it seems). They sound great and have incredible response, but in my experience, a great cane reed will sound slightly better. The advantage however is that the reed will play the same every day of the week for a very long time. But as far as bang-for-your-buck, I think they're the way to go since they can last for a very long time, even playing for several hours a day. In my opinion they also work quite well as a practicing reed so that you don't kill your best cane reeds the day before your performance (though you can certainly perform on them, and I have). They run a little on the thin side in my opinion, so I use the 3 1/2, but might even want to step up to a 3 3/4, but ymmv. Just looked at the Legere site and they say that you can exchange your reed for a different strength if you're unhappy with it, which is cool.   Honestly, if anyone (not just OP) is considering messing around with reeds, I would suggest giving Legere a try. Synthetic reeds have come a long, LONG way, and it is very hard to tell a difference between a Legere and a conventional reed. I'm not a Legere artist or anything, but if Mr. Legere, Mr. Kortschot or Mr. Elvy would like to send me some goodies, I would gladly accept! All jokes aside, they've got a great product.   For reference, I play classical alto, and use cane reeds the majority of the time, switching between 3.0+ D'Addario/Rico Select Classics and 3 or 3 1/2 Vandoren V12s depending on what I'm looking for."
Saxophonics,3bbpul,Indeeeeed,4,Sat Jun 27 22:15:37 2015 UTC,"Going to third this.  Legere reeds are worth a try.  I was a skeptic but found them to play great.  They are excellent for gigs where you may have 20 minutes of break and your reed dries out, or in arid windy conditions where you can never keep your cane properly moistened.  I've never worn one out, but I don't play that much on one particular horn.  I love Legeres best on Bari.  Very responsive imho."

Saxophonics,3bbpul,MurderousPaper,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:48:46 2015 UTC,"For me, it's important why i don't like a particular reed. So here are three things to consider:   The quality of the cane. Each manufacturer draws cane from different stock. Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many cuts you try, Rico (D'Addario) cane is Rico cane, Vandoren cane is Vandoren cane. This is where trying other brands may help. Zonda, Alexander.... I have a list of others and may update later but you get the picture. Facing length. In a mouthpiece, this is the exact point where the rails lose contact with the reed and begin their curvature toward the tip. This point should match the point where the reed starts its flexion. If these two points don't match, then your reed and mpc won't play optionally together. It helps to know the mechanics of a reed so you can identify this point on the reed. You can find the distance on the mpc by slipping a piece of paper between the mpc and reed and seeing where it stops. Vandoren blue box have longish vamps, their jazz reeds shorter. LaVoz are very short, and alexandrs very long. Your break-in and adjustment procedure has a lot to do with your happiness with your reeds. Most jazz players expect reeds to play right out of the box. This kills the reeds. With a proper break in procedure, reeds will keep their resiliancy and last longer, and you can weed out bad ones early. The book on reed adjustment by Larry Guy is a great place to start. (I disagree with a few things... i think you should wet the whole reed and regularly check the flatness of the table with a ReedGeek, which can also be used like a knife and requires no sharpening.)

Use it on cane and synthetic. Has saved many gigs and many reeds I would have either thrown away or been to afraid to gig on.   Have used everything out there to profile my reeds. Sandpaper, razor blades, pocket knife. Reed Geek trumps all. Opened up so many playing opportunities.   To add to this, I also use a silver neck screw I got from Ishimori at NAMM. I'm usually very apprehensive about gadgets but this works. Has something to do with the amount of material soldered around the top of the horn where the neck meets the instrument. Apparently all these solder joints dampen the resonance in this part of the instrument."

It's still got two flat sides, so it keeps the functionality of the original there. I can't help but wonder if the two extra curved edges would be nice for working on the top of the reed, though. I may go ahead and drop a little extra on it. The handle detaches, so I can still have the tiny profile of the original if I want."

Saxophonics,3ayr1a,Spyro19,3,Wed Jun 24 16:06:21 2015 UTC,"Did you buy your sax new or used? If it's used, it's possible that your keys might be leaking a little bit. Do the paper test on all your pads (take a little strip of paper or a dollar bill and close the pad on it by pressing the key, then tug on the paper a little. If it comes out easily, you got a leak), and check to make sure that the pad on your octave key is in place so it covers the air hole perfectly.  I'd take it to an instrument repair guy (if possible, because taking it to a shop generally takes forever) and just have it checked on and maybe tuned up a little. If it's new or if you're positive that there are no leaks, then it might just be your embouchure or you just haven't quite broken in your instrument all the way (it takes a few months). When you warm up, play some long tones in the lower register and experiment with different lip positions to try and get those low notes out.  Hope this helps you solve your problem. Happy saxing!"

Saxophonics,3ayr1a,Nichijo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:56:13 2015 UTC,"To check for leaks, you'll need a leak light, otherwise you won't see them. I recommend THIS ONE. It's cheap, but ridiculously bright and well constructed."
Saxophonics,3ayr1a,captainwhatshisname,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"Everybody should invest in a leak light (~$20) to answer that musical question ""do the pads seal properly?"" without having to go to a technician.   Getting one helped me learn that it's almost always my embouchure.   I had this problem when I began playing, and without an instructor, developed a bad habit to compensate for it... Eventually, I learned to control it, and got pretty good at ""popping"" into the high register without using the octave key -- which is wrong.   But the thing I did right was that in order to compensate for it, I learned where and how it happens. When you do ""pop"", do it again, and again, while adjusting your embouchure, and try and feel for the ""edge"" where it goes up or down.   Every note is played a little differently. Your fingers should develop a muscle memory for finding notes on the scale, but the sound, i.e. the tone, should come from the muscle memory of your breathing and embouchure. Think the sound you want to make! If you don't, and just blow, using your fingers to play the notes, you won't develop that memory.   There should be a lot of overlap in your mind between singing and playing. Sing into the sax -- don't just blow. I don't mean using your vocal cords of course, but think the sound, as if you were singing. It's amazing how much difference it makes."
Saxophonics,3ayr1a,Nichijo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:07:18 2015 UTC,"A leak light is only useful if used correctly.  Close the pad as softly as you can until it makes contact with the tone hole.  Any light showing at this point is a leak.  If you can't see any leaks press softer or go into a darkened room.  Odds are that unless you just returned from seeing an elite technician something is leaking somewhere.  Your embouchure should not be consciously involved in keeping the horn at the right pitch, your air and fingers meet to create sound."
Saxophonics,3ayr1a,captainwhatshisname,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:00:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know why you were downvoted for that. I agree with what you say on how the light should be used. The pad should close all at once.   But it ain't just ""finger and blow""!   You know of course, that you can play overtones, altissimo, etc. all with just the embouchure.   Definitely, check for leaks first, but it's important to practice overtones -- in order to find where the ""break"" occurs, so you can find it when you want, and avoid it when you don't."
Saxophonics,3ayr1a,busy-j,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:59:35 2015 UTC,"And it works even better when you use tongue position and voicing to acquire those same effects.  I'm sure if you googled the Lindeman/Sobel/Potts approach you can find a way better explanation than I can give (it's been awhile since my time studying with Leo).  As for repair, I've worked in two woodwind pro shops as a technician and have just finished bench testing at another in Europe.  There is a time for students to learn to approach overtones and extended techniques, but to me it sounds like this student is better off finding a good technician and teacher and focusing on fundamental sound production.  The answer will not be found on reddit, the sax on the web forum, or any free anonymous source, it'll be found in serious study with a properly functioning instrument."

Saxophonics,3as448,Fairy_footprint,12,Tue Jun 23 01:47:28 2015 UTC,"Wall of text incoming.  I've been to three universities. Rowan University (NJ) for my undergrad, Illinois State (right down the road from Wesleyan) for my Master's, and now LSU for my doctorate. I also taught public school for two years.  My undergrad degree was Jazz Education, which is just about exactly what you're describing. Your undergrad will be filled with gen-ed classes. Education or not, practice like you're a performance major. Nobody wants a music teacher who can't play. Make sure you make the grades in all of your classes, even when it seems like you'll never use the skills the class involves.   Floss.  If you have friends outside of music, you will be amazed at how much free time they have. ""You're only taking 4 classes?!"" Yeah, they only have 4-5 classes at a time, and when they're out they don't have to practice. They have their own challenges, but you will look longingly at their schedules and social lives. This sucks, but if you want to get the most out of your time, you need to get in those practice rooms as much as you can.  Stretch.  That's not to say you should be a leper. Make time to step away from the horn when you can. It's easy to burn out if you put the pedal down to the floor 24/7.   Travel.  Find performance opportunities outside of school as much as possible. University concerts are great and all, but nothing on campus teaches you how to gig properly. Learn by doing. Make contacts - reach out to people who you know play. Talk to the professors and tell them you'd like to find some work.   Respect your elders.  Learn clarinet and flute. Learn them well enough that you aren't ashamed to play them in public in front of people. Make yourself marketable. When you graduate and apply for a teaching job, they will likely expect you to teach demo lessons on several instruments. be sure to concentrate on ALL secondary instruments, (brass and strings included!) but do your best to make yourself a woodwind specialist, not simply a saxophonist.   As far as my undergrad was concerned? 20 minutes outside of Philly, so there was plenty to do and see. Good amount of gigs to go around. I've got more down here in Baton Rouge, but there's a more active live music scene down here.  Wear sunscreen.  As I finish up, I'm not entirely sure if I've answered your question all that well. Meh, it happens. The question was broad. Let me know if you have specific questions. Cheers."

They've got an absolutely top notch education program, on top of an absolutely top notch jazz program.  Fred Sturm was the director of the jazz program there for quite a while until he passed away recently.  I would highly encourage ANY saxophone player, jazz, performance, education, or otherwise, to check out Lawrence.

Now that could of been by choice, but I'm just saying I was unaware of anyone who was a Jazz Music Ed person. Just double check to make sure that is a thing. Either way, incoming Jazz students must audition for the classical teacher in addition to Jazz. I'm sure you could audition for a Jazz band but it's super competitive. You can also request to study with Tom Walsh since he teaches Jazz and Classical Sax."
Saxophonics,3as448,lbcsax,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:29:32 2015 UTC,"I went to the University of Manitoba for two years, studying under a teacher that won the Monk Award.  I loved my first year. I was given so much good information and material from all of the professors there. The ensembles I was in really pushed me, as did the classes. Between ensembles, big bands, and other students recitals I got a ton of experience performing.  That being said, the school was extremely bebop-centric. There was a mostly unstated, but sometimes spoken aloud sentiment of ""do bebop here and everything else somewhere else"". Stated alternatively as ""you'll have time for all that free shit once you graduate"".  My second year hit and it was most of the same. For the sake of understanding I'm going to drop modesty, I was ahead of the curve. My improv class was learning stuff I had learned in my private lessons in my first year. I was in the top ensemble my first year and was placed into the same ensemble my second year and, if anything, the music got easier. 95% of the charts the big band played were Count Basie/Thad Jones/Frank Foster charts. Jones and Foster were straight out of the Basie tradition so they were all very similar.  After a few months I was very dissatisfied with the school, and the city of Winnipeg in general. There were musicians around town that were really great, but it seems like they all thought they weren't done learning bebop yet so they couldn't branch out into the stuff I wanted to get into. I got into many discussions/debates/arguments with my teacher, my opinion being that you can do what you want and what you need (bebop) at the same time, his opinion being more along the lines of ""why would you do what you want when you don't know how to do what you need"".  Shortly into my second year I decided that U of Manitoba wasn't for me. It was too restrictive and the opportunities that the professors there offered me weren't opportunities I necessarily wanted. Sure, if I stayed there I would have direct connections to a ton of shit happening in New York, but I didn't/don't care about New York. I love my hometown and I love the scene there.  So that school wasn't for me, but after looking into the backgrounds of my hometown heroes I realized that almost none of them went to jazz school. I realized what I wanted to do with music didn't necessitate any sort of music degree. A career in music meant teaching, something I didn't really want to do.  So, this fall I'm transferring to a computer science program and I couldn't be happier. I still have plenty of opportunities to get out and play and perform, but now I can do it on my terms, and I have much more solid, reliable career aspects in front of me than I did before.   Basically, I would advise looking at what you want to do with music, exactly. If you love music and teaching your plan sounds great. But if you're doing it because you like music and couldn't think of anything else to major in, like I did, I'd take a step back and really take a look at your future.  That was a lot of negatives, I'm going to post some positives in response to this. I'm not trying to dissuade you from jazz school, just trying to help you make as informed a decision as you can!"
Saxophonics,3as448,hallflukai,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:23:24 2015 UTC,"Positives!  I don't know about the schools you got into, but my school was tiny. Like, 40-50 students in the jazz program tiny. Everybody was on a first name basis with all the professors, and I went out to lunch/dinner with my professors all the time. A lot of the smaller/lesser-known music schools seem to be like this.  Regardless of musical opinions, each and every one of the professors were ridiculously knowledgeable. All of the students would constantly pick their brains for advice and material and stuff to work on.  Jazz school is what you make of it. If you really take advantage of it, like I did my first year, and practice your ass off you'll fly by the people that don't. Between all your professors you'll easily have 3-5 hours of material to work on per day. If you go to music school you have every opportunity to become extremely proficient at music and few excuses not to.  You'll make a lot of good connections, especially if you work your ass off and get into your school's ""elite"", for lack of a better term. You'll be friends with the next Snarky Puppy and Kneebodies, and it will definitely benefit you in the long run.  SuperTonic mentioned not having a lot of free time, but if you have good study habits and can budget your time you'll be fine, free time wise. The only reason I didn't was because I was in big band (which wasn't fucking credited) and played on a lot of recitals. I still remember my schedule. Monday/Wednesday/Friday I had 3 hours of class (4.5 including big band) and Tuesday/Thursday I had  3.5 hours. Throw on 3 hours a day of practicing and that's 7.5 and 6.5. In high school I was at school 8 hours a day. I had plenty of time to take advantage of what college has to offer (especially in Canada, drinking age is 18!) parties, clubbing, gaming, whatever.

Saxophonics,3as448,thepharce,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:00:36 2015 UTC,"Not a music major by any stretch of the imagination, but wound up with a minor in it due to enjoying it enough to take a bunch of classes.  I guess you could say that I have a slightly outside perspective on the programs/people.  I went to a large and well known state school in New England.  Like I just said, my major was not music.  I auditioned for and played with one of the school's jazz bands, played in a couple small ensembles, was perpetual second chair in the symphony (due to music majors getting preference for first), and did the whole theory/lessons/other kind of stuff.  At first, it was amazing.  The people I was playing with were relaxed and fun, the music we were playing was stupidly challenging and rewarding, and I was having a blast.  By the time we hit end of 2nd year though, the dynamic completely changed.  The people I was in groups with suddenly became ""hardcore,"" and started looking down on me because I wasn't a saxophone major, never mind not even music.  The deeper people got into the program, the more aloof and snotty they became towards...well, everyone.  One told me once that in order to suceed, they had to think they were better than everyone else, even when they knew they were standing next to someone better than they were (not me).  The entire mindset went from doing something they loved, to ""I AM THE BEST MUSICIAN IN THE WORLD JUST ASK ME!""  I kept taking music classes during my undergrad and started to notice that the professors started to be very differential to their pet students, and wound up being pretty much ignored even though we were all in the same class, and getting the same marks.  I started feeling resented by the saxophonists I had previously befriended for just being there, and the music department as a whole (I had discovered during my undergrad that I had an affinity and natural ability for opera singing, and was participating in vocal music ensembles/classes as well).  About halfway through my 3rd year in undergrad, I abandoned playing saxophone within the university due to the attitudes of others.  I focused instead on vocal, and finished my primary degree at the end of my 4th year.  I guess the point of this is just to make sure that you are going in knowing that musicians are awesome, but wow, are we assholes when put under stress."

I've recorded myself playing all different saxes, clarinets, and flutes with it and I always feel like I end up with a good representation of what they sound like without much post production.

Saxophonics,3arxc9,tenorsaxman11,2,Wed Jun 24 00:26:42 2015 UTC,"Placement is still crucial especially since the majority of ribbon mics have figure 8 patterns (same sensibility front and back, zero on the sides) so you have to be careful where you place it in front of your instrument but also what's behind the mic. However, I find ribbon voiced with a classic response (which is typically smoothing out the high end) work much better than large diaphragm condensers which can sound quite nasty depending on placement. You'd have to purposefully try to get a bright nasty sound with one of these mics."

Another option would be to use several mics to capture different types of sounds (the core, edge, breathiness, key noise, etc.) but then it's a headache in post-processing to mix and EQ right with no weird phase cancellation going on.  IMO, it's hard to beat a long-geometry ribbon microphone though."

Saxophonics,3ajjb0,achillesisotope,0,Sun Jun 21 12:42:54 2015 UTC,if it does say edegware on it then it is made by keilwerth and sold as a boosey& hawks. It probably has rolled tone holes (which is a real plus). It has the possibilities of a pretty good bari HOWEVER if there is major damage you will spend more money fixing and adjusting it then you would just buying a new one.

Saxophonics,3ajjb0,achillesisotope,0,Sun Jun 28 07:44:39 2015 UTC,"So he spends $500 on the horn + $710 on repad + $250 on adjustment  - Thats $1500. All this would fall under ""minor"" damage. NOW, Lets add dents ($60 an hour) + holes!!! (UP TO $150 an hour) + missing parts, like screws, pins, even a neck (a custom bari neck will cost $275-$400) - This is all ""Major"" damage.

That's lime saying you should never buy a used car because assume of them sometimes have bad engines.   And i don't know a tech worth his salt who would do a repad that didn't bring the horn to full playing condition. And I've worked on the likes of Jean Baptiste and the less expensive Cannonball horns and they are nightmares. I mean literally you make an adjustment to correct a leak and the metal is so soft that the act of play testing it puts it back out of adjustment. NO horn you could buy new for 2k on today's market would be better built than a 60's german stencil. A $500 bari on the wall will be a $1500 bari by the time it hits the bandstand, and even if it's not winning a beauty contest, that doesn't mean it's not a worthwhile investment."

Saxophonics,3af1kk,SuperTonicV7,3,Fri Jun 19 18:14:53 2015 UTC,"Where there are plenty of people who do play jazz and classical on something like a Meyer, I don't think this makes it an advisable thing to do.  My senior recital included me playing Astor Piazzolla's Histoire du Tango on tenor.. on an otto link. While it's not as bad as it could have been, I look back at my choices as a young musician and cringe.   If you have to settle on only one mouthpiece, I'd say find a good classical mouthpiece and use that for your jazz playing, not vice versa. Sounding a little too ""classical"" while playing jazz is much more forgivable than sounding too ""jazz"" while playing classical. I know several players who fit in just fine in a big band on something like an S80. (Hell, Joe Henderson played on a Selmer D.) Otherwise, find individual options for each."
Saxophonics,3af1kk,GordonGestSaxophone,3,Sat Jun 20 01:06:05 2015 UTC,"From your questions, you seem to be either a younger or less-experienced player, so I'll try to answer as I would when one of my students asks a similar question: try not to get too caught up in equipment choices. It's easy to get trapped in the mindset that it's not you, it's the gear, and your sound would be great if you just had the right setup. That being said, the mouthpiece certainly plays a role in your sound. It won't make you sound like someone else, though. You will always sound like you—for good or bad—so the focus should be on improving your sound.  Try to look at mouthpieces as a tool. A good tool helps you do the job, whereas a bad one hinders you. In the same way, a good mouthpiece helps you get the sound you're looking for, and a bad (or inappropriate) one can make your life unduly difficult. To that end, just as there is no all-in-one tool in your garage, there also isn't an equivalent mouthpiece. You'll be able to find some that are reasonably capable throughout the spectrum, but not particularly strong in any one area. There is nothing wrong with having a jazz mouthpiece and a classical mouthpiece. Many players do that, because it's better to have tools that are right for the job.  At your stage I would advise not worrying too much about ligatures. A standard two-screw should be fine."
Saxophonics,3af1kk,bathsaltpartyking,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:24:21 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks! I think I'll just wait a bit more and improve my sound quality and eventually get a classical and a jazz mouthpiece

Saxophonics,3ac1ql,Jts37,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:32:32 2015 UTC,How do you like the 66R? I've been looking into getting one but I've had some people tell me that P. Mauriat can sometimes be inconsistent with their horns.
Saxophonics,3ac1ql,loaferbro,3,Fri Jun 19 16:12:46 2015 UTC,"I love it! I find they're very underrated horns. Very familiar key layout, and response similar to a Selmer Action Series II. The price is astounding for a horn that plays close to pro.  My only complaint is the palm keys are a bit more malleable than I'd like.  Just be careful you don't accidentally bend then.  It's not like it's very bendable, it just bent a little, and only once. It may just be me and not the horn.  Nothing has broken on it, only finish wear is on neckstrap holder, and pads are still great, after almost a year. They come with great gig bags, plenty of pockets to hold your stuff, and good variety of choices.  As far as inconsistency goes, that's something no matter what make you have. Just the nature of a saxophone's construction, no two are perfectly alike. Go to a sax shop and try then out.   If you live near Chicago, there's Pm Woodwind and Repair. They carry plenty, new, used, and vintage, and you can try whatever you want. Just try until you find one that works most perfectly for you."
Saxophonics,3ac1ql,Jts37,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:00:48 2015 UTC,"That's what I like to hear. I've actually played both the unlacquered and cognac lacquer versions of the horn and I liked the cognac one much better than the unlacquered version. The supplier I was going to buy it through offers the dark lacquer version so I'm ultimately going to end up buying that one. From what I've heard they work very well as jazz horns, which is what I'll primarily be using it for once I get to college. I'm glad I found someone who actually owns the horn and I appreciate your feedback!"
Saxophonics,3ac1ql,loaferbro,0,Fri Jun 19 23:31:58 2015 UTC,"When I first when to the shop in Evanston,IL (pm woodwind) they gave me an unlacquered one to try out. It sounds the same, the only difference is horn maintenence. Save ~$400 by not having to continously polish your horn? No thanks.   The only problem I had was that it was a full upfront cost, they had no financing. I think they were lenient and let you pay over the course of 2 months, but it's still a ~$3500 horn. Just check if they can finance it.  Also, since you're mainly jazz, what piece do you use? I'm mainly classical so I only use my TL4. Also, do you use Vandoren reeds for jazz or others?"
Saxophonics,3ac1ql,Jts37,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:33:48 2015 UTC,"Yea the company that we're most likely going to order it through gives some pretty good discounts for students, so my high school band director is going to allow me to order it through the band so I can still get that discount. As for the piece, I haven't been using anything special up to now, just a standard Yamaha one. I was looking into getting a Jody jazz piece because people say they perform really well, but they're a bit pricey, so I was probably going to go with one of the V16. I just haven't decided on metal versus the ebonite one. As for reeds, I use Vandorens."
Saxophonics,3ac1ql,loaferbro,0,Sat Jun 20 10:54:21 2015 UTC,"Word of advice.  DO NOT order the horn online unless they have a return policy. You need to get an opportunity to try it out, and if possible, try different horns out of the same model.   Like I said, try as much as you can. You may not even like it, and want a different horn. Everybody and every horn is different.  That being said, does this online retailer have a store location? Shipping is very dangerous for saxophones, and odering online is worse. Try to find a different sax shop that could even order one to the store to try out.  Where do you live? This is one of those things you'll drive 1-2 hours for because it's such a large investment. There's possibly a good sax shop near you that you don't even know about."

Saxophonics,3abh5w,nothingdoing,2,Thu Jun 18 19:17:44 2015 UTC,"I have used many mics - including the ATM35 and the AT PRO35 (the ""PRO"" models are actually their cheapest ones).  Both the ATM35 and the PRO35 had decent sounding cardioids.  Perfectly fine.  But the wireless transmitter is just awful.  I ended up with fucking Rush Limbaugh coming through my channel at one gig.  Tons of clicks, hiss, dropouts, and squelches.  So I recommend going wired if you're going to use one of these cheaper clip-ons.  That said, after using many many mics, nothing even comes remotely close to a EV RE-20 for stage sound.  It's the industry standard broadcast mic that lives in every sound studio in the world -- well worth the $400.  It's even ok for a decent quality home recording."
