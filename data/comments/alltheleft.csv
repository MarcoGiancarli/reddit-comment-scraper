It sounds like they missed a crucial part of the article since the main argument is that work and gdp growth go hand in hand.  This is mentioned in the article and it makes reference to David Graeber's stuff about bullshit jobs. The point is that we don't create useful jobs anymore. The thing that keeps capitalism going is that we need it to be able to survive, and the more people are able to live outside of the capitalist system (in the ""sharing economy"") the more capitalism loses it's power. So the fact that we have a lot more people working in Starbucks or doing wasteful paperwork isn't relevant to the conclusion of the article."

alltheleft,3dr1ub,Capn_Blackbeard,2,Sat Jul 18 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"We should start demanding that any politician running for Federal office pledge to support a national ban on gerrymandering.  It's a simple matter to have a politically unaffiliated algorithm draw sane rectangular districts with the right number of people in them and no other agenda.  That's how we should be doing things.  Yes, the corrupt who want to keep their guaranteed seats will kick and scream, but the corrupt always kick and scream when the time for reform comes.  Let's get every candidate on record as for or against gerrymandering.  They can hardly say they're for it and not be rightfully despised, after all.  Being for gerrymandering is equivalent to declaring oneself an enemy of democracy."

That's why she jumped on the subliminal racism bandwagon under the guise of 'tough on crime' initiatives, until all of a sudden it becomes politically expedient to get off.  Hillary is the poster-child for political opportunism."

I assume it's because it's written from the perspective of ex-communists, who describe the history of organized communism with a mixture of fond appreciation and trenchant criticism. The author at length acknowledges the unique, historical contribution of communists, especially on race, and provides much colorful detail about that history, which makes this piece so interesting. He also insists that in our days, too, ""American capitalism rests upon a caste system that is a legacy of slavery and Jim Crow"". But none of that was enough, I suppose, as he also describes ""fantasies summoned up by the Russian, Cuban or Chinese past"" as unsuitable tools for our current times. I guess that and some of the 'dirty linen' from communist history triggered the downvotes. Pity that this kind of ambiguity is apparently already considered intolerable."

I'm not sure what to think of it, but at a $15 minimum wage these new regulations wouldn't come into affect. I guess this might be the Obama administration telling corporate America to choose their poison."
