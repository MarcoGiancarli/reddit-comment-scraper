Is a warranty included in the upgrade packages? I'd be concerned about upkeep with that kind of power production."
exoticspotting,3cfznu,K3R3G3,3,Tue Jul 7 22:02:49 2015 UTC,"I have always wanted to know about the 1K+ horsepower Gallardos out there. It seems to be more than possible to make that kind of power, but i never hear anything about special care (outside of Lambo maintenance).  Like, if these engines were this capable, Lamborghini would have done something like this, right? They aren't exactly staking their reputation on engine reliability. If they are essentially race engines, then 1 year of cruising is probably all one engine gets."
exoticspotting,3cfznu,JackBauerSaidSo,3,Wed Jul 8 03:57:29 2015 UTC,"Like, if these engines were this capable, Lamborghini would have done something like this, right? They aren't exactly staking their reputation on engine reliability.    Making that much power does require a lot more hardware. The price would go much higher and I don't think they want to sell at the price point it'd reach with all those mods. Also, their current goal is not to make 1200+hp cars. Surely, Lamborghini could do it if they wanted to. But that's a serious weapon and they currently manage to extract a great deal of performance in the 550-700hp range. With that comes better reliability. While not their main goal, sales would greatly suffer if a several hundred thousand dollar car needed an engine rebuild after 35,000 miles.   Another thing to consider is that things are currently set up in a balanced manner. The brakes are proportionate to the acceleration and speed abilities. The driver assists are, as well. All sorts of stuff. Turning the engine into a complete beast would require other expensive upgrades and a much more sophisticated software setup for avoiding loss of control. In my opinion, it's good that they don't have that much power right out of the factory. There are too many inexperienced/young drivers getting a supercar and destroying it in an accident, endangering/hurting/killing themselves and others. Double the power and instances of that would likely quintuple in quantity and double in severity.   I think things are great as they are right now. Out of the factory, Lamborghinis (and other supercars) are already waaayy too fast to fully utilize on public roads. And that's fine. In fact, it's awesome. But doubling the power out of the factory is unnecessary and serious overkill. It's reserved for a select few who want to put down an additional $50,000+ or whatever it may be to make it that much crazier. They can drive around very carefully, perhaps on low boost, show off their monster, and then crank the boost up at the drag strip on occasion to really open them up. I'm sure these 1200, 1500, 2000hp Lamborghinis are very difficult to tame on the track for even highly skilled drivers. You can't just mash it out of a turn or you'll spin out instantly. (I have yet to see any video of lap comparisons for such upgraded cars, by the way. Plenty of drag races, of course, but no circuit comparisons with their stock counterparts.) Now, imagine someone getting daring on the road with one. It's just asking for mayhem.  TL;DR - Nah. Power overkill, imbalanced over vehicle system and/or too high a price point."

exoticspotting,3cc1qb,Narwheagle,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:31:14 2015 UTC,Is this really exotic anywhere?

exoticspotting,3c77zp,MinorLeagueFuckUp,2,Mon Jul 6 03:58:00 2015 UTC,Replica perhaps?
exoticspotting,3c77zp,CRCasper,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:39:14 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking, but I'll give OP the benefit of the doubt."
exoticspotting,3c77zp,Endlessdonut97,4,Sun Jul 5 23:10:34 2015 UTC,"Why? These are very popular kit cars, and real ones are worth over $2 million. The odds are against it being real."
exoticspotting,3c77zp,BJabs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:26:12 2015 UTC,That's a fucking exotic
exoticspotting,3c77zp,mdave424,0,Sun Jul 5 17:04:51 2015 UTC,Now that is a true exotic spotting
exoticspotting,3c77zp,aanillo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"True replica spotting.  99.9% of the ones that are ""spotted"" are replicas. Still a cool car nonetheless."
exoticspotting,3c72hz,Reffu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:00:45 2015 UTC,"Beautiful car and good photos OP, but is a Corvette really exotic?"
exoticspotting,3c72hz,TrueJeeper,8,Sun Jul 5 17:40:24 2015 UTC,I don't know if it is as exotic as some of the other cars but it is quite rare in Finland so I thought I should post it here.
exoticspotting,3c72hz,aanillo,3,Sun Jul 5 18:08:55 2015 UTC,"For European standards, yes."
exoticspotting,3c72hz,TrueJeeper,2,Sun Jul 5 18:07:58 2015 UTC,Ah I guess I never considered that

exoticspotting,3c4ex0,poop_flinging_monkey,10,Sat Jul 4 20:12:41 2015 UTC,Lmao he has a Ferrari in his new video.
exoticspotting,3c4ex0,FlyingJaguar,9,Sat Jul 4 20:16:14 2015 UTC,That's an impressive Lamborghini but nothing beats my garage library my mentor help me build.
exoticspotting,3c4ex0,GemCollector,2,Sat Jul 4 20:53:57 2015 UTC,"Saratoga, CA. Been to that restaurant, they served us antelope.   Remember that pic of the woman putting her foot on someone else's LaFerrari? Same place."
exoticspotting,3c4ex0,joshu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:24:41 2015 UTC,niice! good to see someone who's also been there before
exoticspotting,3c4ex0,joshu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:56:52 2015 UTC,I must admit I didn't love it enough to go back. The Indonesian fast food place like a block away is WAY better.
exoticspotting,3c4ex0,tyclops,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:56:09 2015 UTC,Bai Tong… the tiny Thai joint is the best restaurant in Saratoga!

exoticspotting,3c4ex0,Nave722,5,Sat Jul 4 20:15:48 2015 UTC,It's mocking this

exoticspotting,3c2xmp,cyanight7,7,Mon Jul 6 18:21:59 2015 UTC,Nope. It's a 650S.  You can tell from the black in the rear and the side scoop.
exoticspotting,3c2xmp,kaio37k,3,Sat Jul 4 07:00:30 2015 UTC,Also the 650S has carbon fiber side skirts.
