If there is a significant amount of money at stake, and there are drugs you can take to increase your chance at success, they will very likely be used.    Just look at every pro sport, and ""natural"" bodybuilding. The vast majority have used/ are still on drugs.    I don't condone it, but the amount of people that think ""it won't happen"" or ""they wouldn't do that"" are too many.  Not to mention, especially when it comes to bigger prize pools. If the demand for it is high (and they do try to implement drug tests). You will see professionals who know how to pass those tests come out for a fee.    The main reason it's not as likely is because organizations are involved. It's one thing for a person in a 1v1 tournament who's not sponsored by a huge organization to go out and cheat and possibly get caught.  However, an organization who's invested a lot more money will take a huge hit to their PR. So they might be more involved with not allowing the players to do anything.  Also, the fact that most players are ""streamers"" and reaching out to a younger audience generally. The potential loss and backlash could very well end their careers if some scandal involving drugs came out."

esports,3dz40m,esportsg,4,Mon Jul 20 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"Dirty bomb and rocket league are both not competitive games. Even if they do get some wind under their sails it will be very small and short term. I don't think either of them have the right, you know, ""look"" for esports, nor the competitive depth for any type of longevity. Both have their own spectator issues too. I wouldn't expect much from either in terms of 'esports' or competition. I'd expect dirty bomb and rocket league, if they do get any growth, to probably be as big or less than fifa, and we all know how large the competitive scene is for fifa (hint: its not very big at all). Who really knows, though. Maybe I'm wrong, but with everything I see now: very, very unlikely.  Street fighter 5 comes out around winter or fall this year, although isn't a completely new game/franchise, it is notable as it will probably replace Street fighter 4.   Another game that is a new installation in an already established competitive game series would be Starcraft 2 legacy of the void. Could actually bring a lot more life into starcraft 2. Comes out probably next early next year, but who knows.  A very interesting game has been out for a little while now: Reflex. Reflex is basically a juiced up version of the old arena fps series quake. It has everything it needs to go big from a game stand point (surprisingly really well made), but all it needs is community. It has basically no tournaments and not many players at all. But if this game picks up it could definitely be a big one. It's actually still early access at this point so its not completely done at all. We'll all have to wait and see with this one. All I can say is its really good and loads of fun.   As far as anything else: none. At least as far as anyone can tell. You really can't predict whether a game will get huge or not until people have actually had the chance to play it."

It's a game that Nintendo threw out for a competitive scene and it's the biggest game in Japan right now breaking records while also being big in the US. The game itself could probably be the same way Smash is to fighters where it will be a different game that introduces something new (while receiving hate for not being a real shooter) and also being labeled as a kids game (something the FPS scene is really something not use to).   I could defend the game and how it could be the next big shooter but it would be hard in its current state and if it grows in the way that The game creator planned it will grow into being one of the biggest shooters but at the same time it will always be the same as smash is the street fighter in the fighting scene to CoD (sorry if I don't know what the biggest FPS is) to the FPS community receiving hate for not being ""true"" to the genre.

I quit Combat Arms for a few reasons and unless this is addressed, this game will also fail:   hackers: this is a threat to any game but this game was terrible and the hackers kept on getting worse. After a few years worse hacks came out. For example, a hacker could ""OPK"" the entire enemy team (one-shot headshot killing from anyone on the map) but the hack later allowed them to kill you dozens of times in seconds even while you're respawning. poor coding to fix glitches: two examples of this. The first is to fix some map glitches, they incidentally made some glitch points be deadly. Touched a ""sharp"" edge near a staircase? Death. Ran up the stairs too quickly? Death. The other example was a failed attempt to fix OPK hacks which resulted in hitbox problems. You could empty an entire clip into someone's back without damage. That's 30 bullets where 3-4 kills you. Overpowered weapons: Nexon has a habbit of releasing actually overpowered NX-based weapons (how they make their money). The stats on the GP-based version (in-game currency) was substandard to the NX-version even though they explicitly promised not to sell any ""golden guns"". Ironically enough - they actually did sell golden guns later. pro-teenage-boy stuff: this started with specialists (specs). Look up Viper to see what I'm talking about. I heard it got worse later and they now have bikini-clad characters when the typical player base is a fully geared out soldier. They also got ""nutshots"" - where you shoot a male character in the balls. Pet peeve of mine I guess since male characters had two weak spots (head/nuts) vs. one female character.

esports,3dn4v4,shazbots,14,Fri Jul 17 21:52:07 2015 UTC,"I accept that challenge and will try to give you a point by point breakdown, it'll take a while:    @3.52 he uses ""32 million people watch the world finals of LoL and only 26 million watch the NBA"". Theres a lot wrong with those numbers. First the nielson ratings make no sense, and don't give an accurate presentation of TV numbers, only a guesstimation. Second the 32 million number is the total viewers for the whole event, the finals(which would be comparable) only drew 8.5 million about a quarter of the NBA tv rating.  He puts smite above dota in popularity. Thats so comical its insulting to my intelligence.  Every major 'advancement' in esports history - CPL's world tour finals on MTV, WSVG being broadcasted on CBS's CSN, the CGS - was supposed to 'take gamers from the basement to the big time' like he described LCS doing.  his explaination of 'moba's'(which is a shit acronym, but thats a topic for a different time) to be the 'most balanced' is laughable. Even dota2, with its decade(as its functionally identical to dota) of development still isn't close to 'most balanced'. Late last year they change the way runes spawn and change where rosh is. They still don't have their shit together. Same for LoL, only much worse because they keep making new champions that can't be properly balance tested by the time they are released.  ""Millions playing the game"" - dude millions play cod,but cod esports is still far behind counter-strike. Millions play eve/wow/etc. playerbase helps an esport grow but it doesn't make a game a lasting esport.  he gets LCS structure wrong. The LCS has 2 seasons - the spring and summer splits, with two different playoffs and two different promotion/relegations.  the leagues and seasons don't look anything alike - the NBA is 82 games over like 8 months, LCS is maybe half that in total time played per team.  He states that ""NBA teams have to be recognized members of the NBA and its not like that in the LCS"" but it is. Riot, as can be seen with the chris badawi situation, can kick out an owner before he even enters LCS - a more extreme example of the donald sterling example in the NBA or the frank mccourt example in baseball.  All sports are meritocracies. The best players in any sport get to the top, their level of success might vary but they are always get to the top.    Furthermore he gives credit to LCS for developing this model, but this model is a blatant rip off of what CS has been doing for over a decade and CS itself aped it from european soccer.   sponsorship in esports is as old as time. Major sponsorship in esports is as old as time. Mountain dew sponsored CGS, Scion(aka toyota) sponsored MLG etc. This isn't a new trend.  His roster and management examples aren't quite right. Just because you have a 'coach' doesn't mean he's actually 'coaching'. Same with managers. I had a buddy who managed a professional CS team in 2009 - all he really did was pal around with the top team and sometimes buy them booze. From my experience this is what most 'managers' are. Hell most coaches are this as well.  Just a slight nitpick but he keeps showing players playing games that clearly aren't MoBA's as examples of his 'pro teams in mobas'. He uses a console player early on, and just now he used fnatic's championship CS team as another example. There are plenty of LoL teams to choose from, just be consistent.  Most players train 5-7 hours a day but also watch film and do other things on the side. Not all esports players train 8 - 12 hours a day. You can't lump 'training' in with 'scouting'. They aren't the same thing.  WHO DOESN'T COME PREPARED TO WIN IN A COMPETITION.  He uses a starcraft players hands to show how great moba players are.  @ 12:30 he starts talking shit on the 'old way' where players struggle to get visa to enter the US. That still happens. Even in LCS. LCS wasn't even the first to get players visa's for players. The CGS was for Marcus ""zet"" sundstrum, who played for compLexity away from his native sweden.    Even now its not common. Most foreign LCS players aren't on players visas. They're on tourist visas which is why so many of them are 'unavailable' during some matches.   I dislike his idea that because i don't want something to go a certain direction because 'growth' means i don't want esports to be successful. I dislike it because i've seen what it does longterm - nothing. ANd he'd know that if he actually researched beyond the last 2 years.  I don't know if he's ever actually played baseball or basketball or football. The rules in those games make no sense. His last bit fall short for me.  At what point did 'moba's' become 'esports'. I didn't play a 'moba' for a decade but I was in esports for the whole time.  just because you make something accessible doesn't mean its good. The inverse is also true - just because something is hard doesn't mean its good.    also, if my experience with CS is any indication, if the game is good it doesn't need to change to attract a bigger audience. The bigger audience will come to it.   He doesn't understand how marketing works."

And don't use ""it was too simified"", the reason is because most of the people watch his videos are hardcore competitive gamers (note that most his vids are on Nintendo) so he simplifies while also adding the fact that this video was really aimed towards the heads of ESPN. While I am personally not a big fan of MOBA's, I support (and actually started to like a few) whatever game is on because of the doors it could open for other games (still hoping for Smash Melee (We esports now)) and while elitism is understandable, bringing a game down over another (like how you think Smite is laughable) is something that isn't showed to people who are possible ""casual"" viewers because they wouldn't really care. It really seemed Ike you didn't try to like the video at some point but his main point is that he is just trying to get esports to the big networks (idk about you but being a part of a grassroots scene and knowing that if it happens there is a chance (however slight) that I could see the game that I love being played that started in basements grow to something this big would honestly make me tear up a bit (already does just seeing how EVO turned out with smash being the biggest overall yet still having relatively smaller prize pools))   (Yeah I'm pretty sure I got off topic after the first sentence.

esports,3dmpfy,eSportsAgent,5,Fri Jul 17 14:57:14 2015 UTC,Getting headlines that Youporn wouldn't otherwise. The player/team clearly knew that this could/would be an issue prior to attending the event. This isn't the first time either.   Can't wait for these kind of stories to become true non-news.

esports,3djc1o,SvennBeck,19,Thu Jul 16 19:03:08 2015 UTC,"It didn't matter then, it doesn't matter now. Seriously, I don't really understand why anyone cared. It wasn't as if this dude was in ESPN management or anything. It wasn't up to him what ESPN was covering. So he posed no threat to esports being on ESPN."
esports,3djc1o,PcaKestheaod,4,Thu Jul 16 20:50:01 2015 UTC,And to be honest should esports really be more worried about trying to get into the main stream or solidifying their core groups?
esports,3djc1o,bauski,9,Thu Jul 16 21:31:06 2015 UTC,"I don't really buy into the whole 'esports doesn't need the mainstream' because mainstream just means popular enough that most people know about it. And obviously esports organizations want that, that's how they make more money. Buuuuuut this guy is so irrelevant to all of it."
esports,3djc1o,PcaKestheaod,2,Thu Jul 16 22:04:47 2015 UTC,"Mmm well, that's pretty true. I think a bigger audience does allow for bigger pay offs from sponsors for tournaments, but I just worry about things like IPL happening all over again, when a tournament organizer tries to grow too fast and ends up burning themselves out too fast.   From what I gather from the information here, it seems like Heart of the Storm, a very young game, had it's first feature on mainstream, and even if the production value had been good, and the SC caster had been up on their game, showing that off as the first interaction between potentially curious audience members seems like a huge risk.  It seems like it would be much smarter to go with something that we know is popular. I'm not a very big LoL fan, but I know how big that crowd is, so I would think that something tried and true like LoL, or CSGO, or Dota would be much better of a first time view. (Dare I hope for SC2)  I think the goal of ""bigger audience"" is good, but I don't necessarily think that showing off a just recently developed game out to the mainstream audience is the best way to market to fans."
esports,3djc1o,bauski,2,Thu Jul 16 23:08:29 2015 UTC,Heroes of the storm :P  I didn't watch the event but I'm pretty sure Blizz just wanted to make some headlines. Blizz doesn't care if more people like LoL and somehow that has a better chance at attracting more people who watch ESPN to esports. Blizz wants to push their game. And realistically to anyone not super deep into esports if you've seen one moba you've seen them all. Blizz didn't put their launch party on ESPN to get more people into esports on whole. They did it to get people to play their game.  This dude said he thought it was stupid and he'd never commentate on esports and for some reason it wounded a lot of esports fan's senses of pride. But its actually irrelevant in every sense of the word.
esports,3djc1o,PcaKestheaod,2,Thu Jul 16 23:41:19 2015 UTC,"I dont even know anymore what people mean by ""needing the mainstream"" or ""being the mainstream"". I mean eSports has allready lots of non-endemic sponsors, eSports has a bigger viewership than some traditional sports and eSports get featured more and more in traditional media outlets.  What do we want and what do we need? Do we need ESPN and other tv networks to broadcast games and eSports shows? I dont think so. eSports resides mostly in the internet and instead of focussing on getting into traditional sports coverage, I feel that its more likely that traditional sports coverage will move to the internet."

I guess it's just a poster boy for the rather non existent opposition to something many people would be happy about, so it's a natural litmus test for success when he has to eat humble pie.  Still just an irrelevant opinion from an even more irrelevant position, and a completely unsurprising outcome. Anyone supporting esports knows it's happening with or without opposition or support from the old guard, just depends who is going to ride the gravy train to the new market."

He wouldn't have enjoyed doing his job if it meant covering video games. Is that really a crime? Also, he left ESPN and even turned down a raise to stay."
esports,3djc1o,RedditorNate,2,Fri Jul 17 00:04:16 2015 UTC,"actually, I think its okay to be a bit bothered. There are many sports fans and broadcasters who, for example, don't like golf (or tennis, baseball, football, hockey, Olympic archery, bowling, it doesn't matter). Maybe they even think that those sports don't qualify as such. So what do all of those people say? Well I think they cover the content and move on without attempting to shame people who like something that he doesn't."

What if esports took a revolutionary step and focused on the negative aspects of taking drugs? As you all can see drug testing, banning or screening does not work in sports. Pro players still take drugs to increase their chances (even with all the risks of getting caught), so why would it be any different with esports? As most of you are aware a majority of professional esports players are under the age of 21. That age demographic is hugely influenced by third party sources and can be pressured in some cases by their teammates, peers and managers to do something; even take drugs. Why not focus on promoting it as a 'cigarette campaign' and show this is what happens to you if you take drugs. I think that would work better than getting players to piss in a cup and it would be cheaper."
esports,3decmu,Spazzer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:47:04 2015 UTC,"This is really not that complicated, guys. Use of prescription medication outside its intended use (in Adderall's case, to control chemical imbalances in the brain) is fucking illegal (in some states, can be worthy of jail time upwards of several decades).

esports,3decmu,AlphaFerg,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:58:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, I don't see any reason for people to not care about this issue. It's a problem and an unfair advantage as well as being illegal. We should not condone any sort of criminal activity."

esports,3decmu,csgolobal,0,Wed Jul 15 18:58:52 2015 UTC,"There are ways to enforce it AND allow people with ADHD to take their prescribed meds and play. However, its prohibitively expensive. In pro sports you can take some substances that are otherwise banned if you're cleared by a league doctor to need said substance. Of course, the league doctors are going to limit said prescriptions as a means of curbing the overprescription of certain meds by non-league doctors"
esports,3ddzzu,nassij,2,Wed Jul 15 15:08:59 2015 UTC,"Some points to add to the discussion:   Please define clickbait before talking about it. ""Clickbait"" as a term gets used often incorrectly within esports. Buzzfeed-style clickbait is literally creating a title that piques curiousity but doesn't answer it, so you need to click (""You won't believe what X person said about Y!""). In esports, however, ""clickbait"" is often used as a term to describe something dramatic. Personally, I think that's okay within reason, as the panel seemed to think, but it gets slanted negatively by calling it something it isn't. Additional to that, as a writer, I think it's interesting to see other professional writers struggle with writing articles intended to be viewed. As a writer, I know that part of what I do is entertainment, storytelling. When I write an article, I want to give it an interesting headline, and I want to write it as a story, rather than as a list of facts. I want people to find what I'm writing about interesting, because I want to bring in readers who might not have an interest in esports or a specific part of esports. I want to be as inclusive as possible, and that means making things catchy and grabby at times. Yes, I've also done 20-hour stats pieces and big in-depth features, but sometimes all a story really needs is 2 paragraphs and a couple tweet embeds. I don't think there's any problem with that. I don't really agree on their discussion about ""burning bridges"" with organizations. I've written, for example, about how Twitch's policies aren't applied equally in a way that allows women to be harassed. Twitch and I are still on good terms, though, and give me interviews and press releases and such. If an organization wants to blacklist you for writing up information that they leaked out by not controlling it properly, and doesn't see that as their fault, I think that reflects much more highly on them. In the long run, they're the ones with bad practices, not you for writing about it."
esports,3derdt,Orbit_CH3MISTRY,2,Wed Jul 15 18:24:31 2015 UTC,An interesting point that hasn't been brought up yet. Violating moral clauses in sponsorship contracts is another big risk teams and players are taking by abusing drugs.
esports,3derdt,AlphaFerg,2,Wed Jul 15 20:17:54 2015 UTC,Absolutely. It will be interesting to see if there is any sponsor backlash  since the community has certainly taken notice of Semphis' comments and sponsors like to side with the angry mob so they can save face

esports,3dfmbg,Raynstormm,2,Wed Jul 15 22:00:55 2015 UTC,"Gosugamers and ESL aren't streaming platforms, they both use Twitch. As for streaming platforms you have Twitch, Hitbox, MLG; Azubu, Dingit, Afreeca, Douyu, Houmao, Dailymotion, Youtube (newest) - these are about the biggest ones. There are smaller regional ones, but that'd take too much time to list them all. Go with this list, it should be complete for the big players."

esports,3dal6p,AlphaFerg,6,Tue Jul 14 20:01:14 2015 UTC,"1) Upcoming/Ongoing events date back to May, and feature some big ongoing leagues and lack other important ones. This area could probably be replaced with the esports subreddits section lower down.   Updated list for this weekend for the rest of this month. Might be easier/better to just move the ""Esports TV Guide"" in the links section into there instead. Not sure yet. Entire sidebar needs remade imo.   2) No more AMAs? Dunno. Seemed we had a couple good ones.   ""If you'd like to do an AMA, PM us!""   3) Links are a bit of a mess, some promotional while others are informational? Maybe this could be redone better with a gameplan.   Agree. Will take some time to figure out how the sidebar should be though.   4) OnGamers is now just Travis at GameSpot, no clue if there's a better way to link to his stuff. TheScoreEsports exists.   Removed OnGamers, replaced with theScore.   5) We need to enforce the few rules we have. I see surveys, I see positions without info whether its paid or not being posted, and the last one is still not enforced: ""Game-specific updates are OK, but please present all content with the greater context of the esports industry in mind."" There is a lot of just spam with zero context provided that doesn't really belong. Just a post about an event that is happening is NOT ENOUGH to be valid—provide context! Is that event important enough to be here? Is there something noteworthy that makes it interesting to a global esports audience? Explain! And if not, get rid of it.   Agree but we have to figure out where to draw the line. At one point is something too game-specific and not relevant enough for r/esports?   6) I'd really like to see a ""General Q&A"" area somewhere in the sidebar to prevent people asking the same questions over and over. Quesitions like ""What game should I play?"" (Answer: the one you like the most), ""Is esports a real sport?"" (Answer: it doesn't matter), etc   Added.   7) Also there are several mods that are not active in this subreddit, or aren't active on Reddit period.   Not a question or thing that can be done ಠ_ಠ   8) Can we add a rule where job postings have to have the following: paid or volunteer (existing rule), NAME of the organization, LOCATION of the organization, whether the job would you require you to move, or whether its an online position.   Yes.   9) Subnote: ""Paid vs. Unpaid"" should probably be expanded to ""Paid in cash, in equity, in merch, or not paid.""   Yes."

Just a really great match through and through and highlights the production value Wargaming strives for during its biggest event. Na'vi vs Hellraisers  Note: things have changed since this most recent GF as well as Wargaming keeps trying to fnd the right formula basically, for instance neither of these maps are still used in professional play. A year ago WG changed the match format to resemble something closer akin to CS:GO then what it was previously (a boring campfest) so if you have only had a taste of it from over a year ago this will be very different.

esports,3d1s8b,G2Wolf,3,Sun Jul 12 21:40:55 2015 UTC,Lower your standards. You're not going to get top level teams without tens of thousands of dollars or more.
esports,3d1s8b,peachpicker5000,3,Sun Jul 12 22:06:13 2015 UTC,"^ pretty much that right there  Honest opinion and what I've told lots of people before. You need to understand the inside and out of an organization to make it succeed.  Yes you can have a team in every esports title, but there is an underlining structure of staffing, coaches, mangers, content creators and several other significant factors that go into an organization and it will cost lots of money to have everything run smoothly.  An organization is a business that is built from experience,  you need background in the industry to even slightly understand the process of acquiring players correctly and ethically.  If you don't have a deep background, start by looking to gain a mentor that does and is willing to help you along the way.    For money...well good luck, sponsorships require having an established brand and at bare minimum of a recognized team that is performing well.  Investors aren't necessarily looking to invest in an organization doesn't even have players as the ROI on esports orgs is still quite low if any."
esports,3d1s8b,blacknoise_EGGy,2,Mon Jul 13 02:21:51 2015 UTC,"This isn't some get rich quick scheme. Either be part of the team by actually playing at a top level, or have something that you can offer to these teams if you aren't able to play at the top level."
esports,3d1s8b,razor5cl,2,Sun Jul 12 23:00:43 2015 UTC,"I hate to say it, but the money idea someone else suggested is basically it. That's how you're going to attract a team or individual players. Considering that most top level pros are already either on teams where they are performing well, winning titles and earning a good salary for it, or there are those who are on a team with their closest friends having the times of their lives, you're either going to have to pay a huge amount(thinking in the tens of thousands, bearing in mind that Cloud 9 had to spend $40,000(?) to persuade a teamless player to join them over someone else, and he didn't even have a team himself) or find an up-and-coming team and nurture their talent, which will require you to know them very well and realise that they have more potential to be great players at whatever game it is than another team of young stars."

esports,3ctlnp,KubikiriAsa,3,Fri Jul 10 17:51:14 2015 UTC,Really insightful video and I feel like it is an important one for everyone to watch. It's to remind people where this amazing industry came from and the true meaning behind esports. Hopefully over time the meaning won't get lost we will still have players who play to have fun and be the best while making money to sustain their dreams.
esports,3csv6c,razor5cl,5,Fri Jul 10 14:29:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a Starcraft mega fan. No one knows 'sustainability' crashes like we do. SC2 fell under the weight of its own scene and poor choices from Blizzard in 2013. SC2 is still going very strong, remains in the top 5 esports easily (if only at #5) and has HUGE potential for growth. Anyways, to the point.  In my opinion, based on what I've seen from DOTA, LoL, SC2, and CS:GO, yes it is absolutely sustainable. GO has an incredibly large and active player base that is tied VERY tightly to the esports scene. The content that is produced by professional studios, fans, and Valve is perfect for both stimulating growth and keeping fans interested in the game.  The pro scene is dominated by teams and players who come from areas where the game is popular. Unlike Starcraft, there is always potential for the 'home' team to win major tournaments and that's a really big deal in stimulating growth and ensuring sustainability for a scene.  I understand the worry around betting and balance but honestly I think those fears are exagerated. Betting drama will exist regardless of in game skins, there are plenty of esports betting websites where people can bet real money. Although the skins make it more appealing to more people to bet, and therefore DDOS/throw games, that WILL exist regardless and there are lots of steps that can be taken by all sides (betting websites, teams, players, the dev) to protect against this. As for balance, well when both teams have access to the same tools it will never be as bad as a MOBA or an RTS or a fighter where one player/team has access to an imbalanced tool that the other player/team does not."
esports,3csv6c,PcaKestheaod,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe I misinterpreted but it seems like you think the LCS structure is bad for LoL as an esport when it is the thing that is keeping it at the top. Would LoL be where it is now without being propped up by Riot and still on a tournament circuit, no...absolutely not. In fact, esports wouldn't be where it is without Riot propping up LoL esports. The league structure ensures that fans know where to find the action every week, the players know how they are going to afford to live every month, and sponsors and startups know what to expect when entering into the scene. The LCS has done so much for not only LoL but the progression of esports as a whole.   In fact, the lack of an umbrella organization to oversee CSGO and Dota esports, like Riot does with LoL, will end up being harmful to the sustainability of the scene. Third parties have their own agendas and tend to not care about any other organization but their own, which makes sense because it is business. Not that Riot are angels that only oversee their sport with benevolence and no idea of profit in mind. However, Valve or whatever organizations decided to fill this void, could rule the esport for the benefit of the esport and nothing else. Which is more than ESL, FACEIT, Dreamhack, or any other tournament organizer will do.   CSGO is probably in a better state competitively than Dota but the lack of a central league in both only harms the sport going forward. I firmly believe that team esports were not meant to be played in tournament formats like the majors. It works for Golf, Tennis, and SC2 because they are solo games and the prize purse and endorsement deals tend to only go to one person (for some reason SC2 adopted a team sport model). Team sports work better with a league structure where players are paid a portion of their salary per game. The playoffs in traditional sports are bonuses, not where the bulk of their salaries come from. That seems trivial but it adds so much stability to a scene, stability progresses a sport, progress leads to sustainability.   TL;DR LCS is great for stability and possibly sustainability in the long run."
esports,3csv6c,ESB-Alan,3,Fri Jul 10 23:28:04 2015 UTC,"You make a sound point however one basic counter point I can make which someone else has already pointed out is that Counter-Strike and DotA have already existed for a very long time as eSports without an umbrella organization. Granted, they don't have the astronomical viewing figures that League does, but that's not just because of the lack of a central League.  I disagree with the idea that Counter-Strike needs an LCS equivalent. You state that just having knockout tournaments on their own is bad for the teams however most leagues now use a conventional sport style where there's an online league that teams use to qualify for an offline finals. Maybe adding some sort of compensation for placing in these online leagues at the highest level  could be a good idea though, so I agree with you there. Furthermore adding a central league would discourage the forming of new up-and-coming professional teams as their barrier to entry would be having to get good enough to qualify for said central league first, and obviously the ability for new teams to be formed and to compete at the highest level in any eSport is key for long-term success.  I can't really argue about the intricacies of Riot's control over League as I don't have as much in-depth knowledge over that game and its scene, however."
esports,3csv6c,ESB-Alan,0,Sat Jul 11 11:10:46 2015 UTC,"Good points, however I don't really understand the desire to continue to be extremely open competition at the highest level. Let the professionals be 8, 12, 16 teams and let the amateur scene develop players that eventually land on those teams. There is nothing wrong with that at all."

esports,3csv6c,ESB-Alan,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:56:07 2015 UTC,I guess the point is progress not sustainability. Without a central body I don't think they can move much further than they are because as it is the scene for Dota and CSGO isn't sustainable.   I miss our chats <3

I rent out some tv's and pc's for these events as well as some chairs, and I get local gamers to volunteer to help organize it. I make a company, advertise these events to the local gamers, use social media sites to get more attention, make a website/blog for the events, and try to grow something similar in as many nearby areas as I am able. I stream these tournaments, accept sponsorships, require a small entry fee, and let companies open up venues at the events in return for a small sponsorship. I let local players who are good on the camera cast the games. The emerging casters become my go to guys for the big events for each scene. I start to hold more events for each game, and start stretching my events more across the country. Once the local casters/players/teams are established in an area I start holding the events in bigger venues with more coverage. People can now buy tickets to go to these events and watch them at the venue. Between that, twitch, and sponsors my volunteers are now paid employees and I am able to do this full time from now on. By now my local scene is a part of the national scene of esports to a degree, and at least a couple teams have been noticed and are playing in other tournaments. My company is established, I am in contact with the other esport organizations, and I am likely known by the local government officials at this point, so my opinion on anything they do related to esports becomes quite relevant. The local well-known players should form a union with the rest of the players in the esports scene now if they haven't already. I build a real stadium to hold even more and bigger events, and I hold a once a month major event for a ""ultra high level"" competition of the best players from each scene. I keep doing this to every scene I can. As I get lots of stadiums and their are more teams, I organize a league that organizes the teams game schedules and playoffs. I make billions... but I started off just wanting to hold some local esports games for fun.   Honestly I would love to kickstart this, but I have no experience organizing events, no money, no fallback plan, and I'd prefer to have someone who has organized events before. My local scene is mostly smash bros for the time being and it isn't big enough to nearly pay back the amount of money my friend dropped into organizing it. I don't know if their are many people in Ottawa who play enough of each other game (other than LoL and smash), or if we could find a venue and some tv's/consoles/pc's we could get for free, so yeah it probably won't happen until esl/dreamhack comes to Canada.

They get by having players bring consoles and the college lets them use their tv's and community room. Maybe they could join the scenes together if we had some extra tv's/consoles and added in some hype from the other schools.  When I look at the other scenes that have potential locally, getting computers and a venue for something like LoL would be a nightmare.

I don't know if they're profitable, but each time I've been in, there were plenty of people.  eSports bars like AFK, Meltdown, are proof of concept for you. They've shown that gamers are interested. What it doesn't show is the insane amount of work that goes into building one of these. It's hard enough to start a successful restaurant (60% close in the first year), now throw in expensive electronics and a small (albeit growing) user base and you've got a tricky balancing act ahead of you. I would look into franchising. You'll have the support of business owners who have been through this before, and who are incentivized to help you out.  A couple random notes because I find it interesting: AFK and meltdown are not your biggest competitors. It's actually the couch. There needs to be a better reason for gamers to come to you besides watching the same stream that's available to them for free online. AFK uses membership subscriptions to allow for unlimited play on their computers and gives them stable and predictable income. That gets gamers to come in regularly and make occasional purchases which adds up. You didn't mention having computers in your post, but definitely consider it. You can find an investor and/or strike a deal with a computer company to break up the cost so you don't pay for everything upfront.  gl, hf!  -Serial entrepreneur with a venture in eSports"

CBS being an exception in that they now have onGamers/gamespot doing esports coverage.   I don't think it is too realistic to think you will find accurate numbers for what they have contributed financially. It is also difficult because a lot of these companies have global efforts, regional, and then localized efforts as well. Pepsi is a good example of this, I only remember them sponsoring a few teams (and I think a few events) within China - World Elite was sponsored by them, and then they title sponsored some Crossfire team or something as well.   If I were you I would pick a handful from different regions (One NA, one EU, one Asia, one Korea), and try and track down all of their efforts on the scales mentioned above. That would make for a more structured research project, and also make your life a hell of a lot easier as you try to find information on the specific entities.

He was known by many people for his amazing Zeus plays. Also as of late the name has also been given to the player Mushi)    L-God: Loda (Loda revolutionized Dota 2 and came up with many of the strats that you see today.

They basically dominated the smash scene for the last X amount of years, only ever losing tournaments/sets to each other. Recently, they have been challenged by others like Shroomed, PewPewU, and most notably Leffen (who is considered by many the new god).  SCBW - Flash, Jaedong, Bisu. Arguably the greatest players of each respective race to ever play the game. Each revolutionizing how the game is played from not only a mechanical point of view but also a strategic.  SC2 - MVP, the best player during the Wings of Liberty, known for his immaculate series planning. Life (a little bias by me), the first player to ever beat MVP in the finals of GSL (let alone it being his first time participating) and being the most clutch player you will ever watch. He's all-killed, reverse all-killed, come back from numerous 0-3 deficits to win 4-3. He's only like 18 or 19 now too, so he's still not even in his prime.  FGC - I lump this set of games together since most of the players will enter multiple titles. The one, the only, the beast, Daigo. Most known for his EVO moment #37. He was the first japanese player to earn a nickname, The Beast, and has created a mantra for the Dragon Punch uppercut (known as a Shoryuken), named the Umeshoryu which is touted as unblockable (due to Daigo's inhuman ability to know when to use Shoryus). Justin Wong also fits in the god category IMO, he's always a championship contender in every single game he plays and has the nickname ""Marvelous"" for his dominance over the Marvel vs Capcom series."

esports,3cnajo,Decency,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:04:23 2015 UTC,Can you explain the EVO Moment? It looked like he just blocked a combo and counter-attacked.
esports,3cnajo,CrazyEddie041,3,Fri Jul 10 00:32:31 2015 UTC,"A bit of background before I go into the explanation.   So, in Street Fighter 3, there is a mechanic called a ""parry"". In essence, a parry works like a block but requires its own input (rather than holding back or down-back with the joystick), requiring one move the joystick forward at the precise moment. The benefit of the parry, however, is that it prevent chip damage, or damage dealt while blocking (usually via a special or super). The difficulty of parrying Chun Li's super is that is has many hits at very, VERY wonky timings and it comes out so fast that you have to preempt the first hit in order to parry it. Also, you build ""meter"" by taking and receiving damage, this meter is spent to use, in this instance, supers.   That out of the way. Daigo, knowing how Justin Wong plays, predicts that Justin going to try and end the game with a super. As such, Daigo starts adjusting the space between he and Justin, notice the microadjustments he makes in positioning right before the super starts. Daigo chooses to parry the super, buffering the first parry (which needs to be preempted) and proceeds to parry the entire super.   The final hit of the super sends the opponent into the air, the significance of this is that it CAN be parried on the ground (as far as I know). Daigo instead jumps and parries it from the air, which allows him to retailate with an aerial and get JUST BARELY enough meter to do a full combo which in turn JUST BARELY wins him the round.   The greatness from the play is the combination of situational awareness (knowing his win conditions under an immense amount of pressure), the hard read (knowing exactly what Justin was going to do), and the audacity (actually going for the parry itself)."

That, along with Smite's pro league expanding from 12 to 16 teams this year and anticipated growth due to the game's release on Xbox One, has HiRez worried that it would run into the same problems as Dota 2.   HiRez runs that tournament and they're acting like it is not their fault the prize distribution was awful. ಠ_ಠ"
esports,3cl5rt,G2Wolf,2,Wed Jul 8 21:30:29 2015 UTC,Curious people's thoughts on this. I posted my dota 2 prize distribution article a while back and opinions were very polar about whether it was good or bad.
esports,3cl5rt,AlphaFerg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:03:50 2015 UTC,"It might be a tad low, but I think a cap is good. One of the bigger worries with Dota is that TI just overshadows everything. Even DAC which is the most similar event, doesn't come close.   I know a lot of Dota fans like the huge prizepool, but at this point it's much better to think of the long term and start investing that money into something more year round.  I would say that the Majors are a good idea, but almost zero details about Majors have been announced so it's hard to place any value judgements on them right now. Hopefully it turns out like SMITE is doing right now though. Prizepools capped and have it spread out to the rest of the majors. Whatever is excess goes into the next major's ""base"" prizepool, and have the money reach out much farther."
esports,3cl5rt,Siantlark,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:14:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. $1m for a 5 man team is a bit low, but I imagine if the prize pool starts climbing over the $2.6mil they had last year, they'll raise it accordingly. 90% for the top 4 teams is just too uneven."
esports,3cl5rt,AlphaFerg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"It'd be better if Hi-Rez paid out salaries like Riot does, but I'm almost sure that they don't.   One thing that Valve is doing pretty well though is spreading out the prizepool a lot more for the teams. I agree with G2Wolf on this, having 90% prizepool go to top 4 is entirely Hi-Rez's fault. Valve does it better. It's still not far from perfect (Where the fuck is the money for 15/16th?) but with the huge prizepool, having 75%+ of the money go to the top 4 isn't really that bad in terms of monetary value to the bottom teams."
esports,3cl5rt,Siantlark,2,Wed Jul 8 21:55:55 2015 UTC,"Valve isn't that much better: 75% for top4, almost 90% for top6. 9th place and below get less than 0.5% each. 15-19th get nothing....  For how much money there is and how many teams are really involved (regional qualifiers, open brackets), Valve should be paying out a lot better than what they have been."

esports,3cl5rt,Siantlark,2,Thu Jul 9 02:24:11 2015 UTC,This is stupid. Why not but a lower % tied to the top? What determines this cap? What happens when they need to significantly raise it and don't in time?

""it is important that we allow as many people as possible to make a living""   Alongside the statement a cap of $1 million  for a yearly tournament for 80 players is basically a joke. $12.5k each? This seems like a cop-out that I would expect if the scene was dying and they didn't think they could match last years pool (which would kill a ton of hype) but Smite seems to be growing to me."
esports,3cl5rt,Decency,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:01:25 2015 UTC,"Will be interesting to see how this approach works in the long run.   Given that the world championship is their flagship event, $1mil feels like an arbitrarily low cap as on outsider, but who knows- maybe there's more than meets the eye.  Perhaps this is the first step in something that more closely resembles a major system with consistently large prizepools through out the year."

esports,3clt2t,niantic128,4,Wed Jul 8 22:20:48 2015 UTC,"I think this article summarizes a viewpoint that a lot of people feel, and it does articulate that point well. The idea that as valid a competition as esports are, they aren't ""real"" sports. I am an undergrad studying sports industry operations with an emphasis on esports, and have had discussions about this topic with anyone who will listen on my campus. The conclusion I always come to however, is that esports, while certainly different than traditional sports, are not different enough to be considered less than sports. The premise that sports require a physical element that video games lack is understandable, but doesn't hold up when examined closely. Look at the differences between a game like League of Legends, and chess. If you take someone who has never played chess before, and have a master tell them exactly what moves to make, they'll win the game. That would be impossible to do with LoL, Counter Strike or Starcraft. This is because there is in fact an element of physical prowess involved in these games. Over time playing you build up coordination and skill on both a mental and physical level. Is it less strenuous than most traditional sports? Absolutely. But how do you quantify that? What is the dividing line in physicality that separates a sport from a game? I know that most people will continue to follow that gut feeling that video games aren't physical enough to be sports, but when looking at esports from an academic standpoint, I believe that they meet every criteria to be considered  sports in their own right."
esports,3clt2t,Metavac,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:10:18 2015 UTC,"I would love it if we were on the same campus/university, I feel like there's enough substance within the topic to have a lengthy discussion. I really appreciate your input and you make some valid points concerning quantifying and evaluating what actually makes a sport exactly that. I wish this site was filled with more calculated responses like this, thank you!"
esports,3clt2t,Metavac,2,Thu Jul 9 01:37:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, there's definitely a lot to say on the topic! I'm always happy to discuss esports, and really do like that you bring up this issue in your article. Glad I could provide my two cents on the issue!"
esports,3clt2t,JohnTheWriter,2,Thu Jul 9 01:56:53 2015 UTC,"I've given tons of speeches and presentations about eSports at my school. There's not too many who actually follows any game there but I'm lucky to know almost everyone so well that they are able to actually listen what I have to say.  I've got many football, ice hockey and golf fans to support me that eSports is actual sport and people really should appreciate it more.  It's always good to get more of these non-gamers to support stuff like this"
esports,3clt2t,Ballsackologist,2,Thu Jul 9 06:16:32 2015 UTC,"In the present, “esports” is used to describe highly competitive gaming contests that usually include a large prize pool that players and teams contend for.   CS teams, StarCraft players, and Quake players in the early 2000s were doing exactly this as well.    There are few actual teachers and coaches that are readily available for aspiring competitive gamers that traditional sports have plenty of.   CS players have been offering ""coaching"" for over 10 years now. ESEA even has an instructors system built in for people to contact these coaches and pay them. I'm sure other games have similar systems or at the minimum offer it by contacting people through Twitter or their personal or team website."
esports,3ckcno,Goldegen,3,Wed Jul 8 16:14:35 2015 UTC,"National leagues and events are a vital part for the growth of esports. As much as people like the global feel of esports, most companies operate with large national advertising budgets (as local advertising is usually more effective than international advertising, as you can tailor communication messages to local consumers).  If esports want to really increase sponsoring and advertising revenues, they need to find a way to make these local events and leagues succeed."

esports,3ckcno,maurosQQ,3,Wed Jul 8 22:04:23 2015 UTC,"When it comes to viewership and momentum, yes I agree!   However, revenues are still low compared to viewership numbers. This has a lot to do with that most traditional advertisers have not jumped on the bandwagon yet.  Esports is thus  still a marketing investment for a lot of game publishers that they try to recuperate by more people playing their game.  Therefor, if esports wants to become a profitable spectator sport on its own (like a lot of traditonal sports) more big companies need to get on board, and those companies often have national budgets."

esports,3ckcno,maurosQQ,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:58:34 2015 UTC,"I am aware of the big multinational companies that are sponsoring esports. The problem remains, however, that their international marketing budgets are a fraction of their local marketing budgets.  You are actually making a good point yourself. In Korea, the national esports infrastructure is the most developed. There are so many Korean esports leagues and events. That is the reason why companies such as SK Telecom, KT, JinAir and SBENU are sponsoring those teams. You will not find a SK Telecom team in North America. No, they are all Korean teams, sponsored (most likely) from their national marketing budget."

It would help the amateur scene and let new players shine.  If we have enough kids to fill ice hockey clubs in every town, why can't we make teams for games which have even more players"
esports,3ckcno,JohnTheWriter,0,Thu Jul 9 07:21:50 2015 UTC,"I feel that these national-focussed events arent here to stay in eSports. They hurt the idea of mixed European or NA teams and create disadvantages this year.  And I dont see them as an annual fun tournament aswell, because there is no overarching structure in eSports that would allow mixed-nation teams to swap around for the tournament without missing out on practice for other tournaments."

It has little prestige and is overshadowed by the European Championship for example in football.  Also the olympics is way more integrated into traditional sport structures. Since there is a governing body and national comitees that are often part of the state or in close contact with state sport departments. Neither are esport departments in states widespread nor is their a governing supernational esports body. This is way different esports run on entirely different schedules in the year and finding a spot to hold a olympic like format is difficult.

A portion of your introduction goes towards getting sponsorships, but in reality I can see you selling a advertisement spot for $0.02 per view if your website hits 20.000 unique views per month.

I think it is often the reverse: the game is validated, thus the prize pool gets astronomical.      For example, dota 2 has the largest prize pool and it is (almost) entirely crowdfunded by interest in the tournament. Its size is a result of interest by the community. I don't see that as unsustainable - if players stop being interested in The International and stop buying compendium stuff each year, then the prize pool will decrease. But players are interested and so they do buy that tournament-related stuff, the sale of which contributes to the prize pool."

esports,3bvwbz,SsurebreC,9,Thu Jul 2 16:09:22 2015 UTC,"Game Developer Involvement.   Valve's involvement in DOTA has shown what can be done with the International.  Blizzard has been good, but the fan base was limited and I doubt they were seeing much return on their investment into competitive gaming. Its a nice start but we need more.  Gaming unlike basically every other competition can be flat out ruined by the game developers.  Counterstrike is a great example.  That game was on top of the world for shooters. The developers went out and then release CS:Source and thus split the community in half.  Sponsorship dollars shrank due to smaller communities on both sides and it was a hard time for both.  Now we have CS:GO which certainly factored in a lot more of what the gamers wanted and the game is doing well again.   Things like that can't happen in other competitions.  Nobody is going to come along and re-design the chess board and mess that game up.  Other competitions get small tweaks such as race car driving modifying racetracks or car regulations each year.  Soccer has been unchanged.  Others have  actually changed a bit. American football had the goal posts moved back, Basketball had the 3 point line added, then adjusted. The list goes on but these are small changes and A LOT of thought gets put into them. When we see major changes to the game, they just dont work.    If we have developers not supporting games then team sponsors are not going to stick around. Lets use counterstrike as an example again.  If another CS is released and splits the community, the millions in sponsor dollars are going to go out the window for the teams and the games. That just can't happen if esports is to grow. Game developers need to upgrade games, and see a profitable reason to do so.. Sequels to games are NOT THE SAME GAME.  the MOBA scene has seen good support, but what's going to happen when they need to move the game to a new engine to support future hardware?   Developers need to be making some kind of return on competitive games and it might take the community kicking back some of the money to pull in developers and publishing companies so that the games can safely be invested in by outsiders. Investors aren't going to be dropping big money in a volatile gaming environment.  Stability is needed"

Let's not forget that Developers have to actually build in features that support esports such as a good and working spectator mode and keep the balance of the game throughout the entire lifecycle of the game.  And then, if the Developers bring out an update that breaks something, this can really put a damper on tournaments etc. In normal sport, you only ever see something get cancelled or delayed if it's an outdoor sport and it begins to rain."

esports,3bvwbz,Decency,3,Thu Jul 2 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"The money isn't going to enough teams. Payout structures have been way too top heavy. A multi-million dollar tournament shouldn't have 50%+ of the prize money going just to first place, while not paying out the majority of the teams.   Even TI has been at fault for this.

There's no reason why it shouldn't be 25-30% instead, and allow for a deeper payout structure. It could be something like:  30%, 15.0%, 12.5%, 10%, 7.5%, 5%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.25%  instead of ti4's payout structure:  46%, 13.5%, 9.5%, 7.5%, 6%, 4.75%, 0.45%, 0.35%, 0.2%  It's ridiculous how top-heavy ti4 prize structure was."

esports,3bvwbz,FlukyS,2,Thu Jul 2 18:50:13 2015 UTC,"I am not sure what the ratio is, I don't doubt that is a set ratio either. This is something that could (and probably does) vary between organizations as well as player contracts. In my opinion, it should never be lower than 60:40 or 65:35 on average, in the player's favor. If the prize pool is low then I would say 70:30, player's favor."

esports,3bvwbz,devil_92,4,Thu Jul 2 18:46:08 2015 UTC,"No centralised bodies is the main problem. The buck stops with the developers which is a bad thing.

esports,3bvwbz,Olhausen3,3,Thu Jul 2 20:46:50 2015 UTC,Well it takes each party being realistic and collaborate about it. Like if teams are there you need the majority not just a few. For developers they should be silent mostly I think. Players definitely need to unionize though it is seriously important.

esports,3bvwbz,maurosQQ,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"this is also bad for the competitors because you throw away your knowledge of 1~4 years of experience when you switch games. This is one of the issues of a game being run by a company instead of being able to just to go a soccer field and play the goddamn game. You're attached to a company and you have to accept the fact that your ""e-sport"" main focus is to provide money.   I'm a huge fan of the counter-strike and fighting games community because they managed to keep the same game for over  15 years. Yeah they had some changes and gaps between but the essence is the same. Warcraft 3 and starcraft:BW are dead, for e.g."
esports,3bvwbz,devil_92,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:51:15 2015 UTC,"But i do think that the fact that it is constantly changing is a strength for these games,just look at Dota 2,the amount of players spike when there is a new real patch released,that means new meta,new ways to play a her etc,and i think that the game really needs that because after a couple of months the meta grows stale,and it becomes a tad dull at times that nothing new is happening."
esports,3bvwbz,maurosQQ,2,Thu Jul 2 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"I do love when a new hero in dota comes out but maybe this hype is meant to generate money and happens to be bad for the sport?  I mean, chess and olympic sports haven't changed much over the years and I doubt people get hyped when a change happens.  This constant change is good for people who have a lot of spare time and are quick learners. Imagine wanting to be a pro chess player but the game changed every 3 years.

esports,3bvwbz,dmr83457,6,Fri Jul 3 08:26:07 2015 UTC,"There are several problems, Ethics is a big topic"
esports,3bvwbz,TLSN_Troyseph,2,Thu Jul 2 17:31:23 2015 UTC,"Ethics is a problem, but one that will probably solve itself over the next few years, especially as the industry matures. I think outsiders who have zero involvement in eSports besides an investment (people who never grew up really playing games) are going to do this. also slick people on the inside who feel they can take advantage of an immature industry, where things are still working themselves out. But These cannot be long term sustainable strategies, especially if they want continued backing in a close knit community that is paying attention to who adds value to eSports and who simply wants to make a profit"
esports,3bvwbz,maurosQQ,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:57:41 2015 UTC,"Can you elaborate? Is this player to player, team to player and vice versa, environment itself, tournaments, or companies?"

esports,3bvwbz,Heflamoke,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:02:12 2015 UTC,"Would you think guidelines, perhaps strict guidelines, would help?"
esports,3bvwbz,Heflamoke,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:07:18 2015 UTC,"Who would write the guidelines, who would enforce it, and who all would have to comply?  I think it could work for a completely top-down game like LoL where everything must go through Riot, but it wouldn't work very well for a game like say Quake where it's all community driven and each community might have their own guidelines.  It also depends on what problems you're trying to tackle.. whether its lack of professionalism, tourneys not paying out, teams not paying out, match fixing, unfair contracts, players not respecting contracts, other teams not respecting contracts, and I'm sure plenty of other issues.  Theres a whole lot of stuff to address and I don't think a blanket solution is the way to go."
esports,3bvwbz,Heflamoke,2,Thu Jul 2 18:26:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for writing this. I think the tournaments would need to have these rules and breaking of the rules would forfeit winnings (or partial forfeit), possibly title, possible ban, perm ban for subsequent problems.  Now to the issues you listed:   lack of professionalism   Not much can happen there unless tournament then this can be controlled due to penalties. I don't think the gave companies can help here, plus lots of players are very young which doesn't help.   tourneys not paying out   I'm personally working on this.   teams not paying out   Interesting, I didn't realize this was a problem. I'll check this out too.   match fixing   Tough to do but can you elaborate - does this happen in the larger tournaments?   unfair contracts   Hmmm, this is interesting too.   players not respecting    Isn't it a legal document or shouldn't it be?  I agree that a blanket solution wouldn't apply but I'm trying to see what problems can be addressed :]"

Then there are plenty of stories about teams conducting unethical behaviour and exploiting their players. Since I mainly follow LoL, you had the AHQ-Korea matchfixing last year, which resulted in an attempted suicid by one of the players.   Then there was the Kori and MYM incident, where the player manager threatened to file a suit against the players mom since she signed the contract and threatened to take her home, if the player would switch teams.  Then if you look towards China I dont even know where to start. The rules are broken on a daily basis. Last relegation tournament for the Chinese lol league LPL, team Gamtee knocked out SHRC. Then Gamtee was bought by another team, all the players were released and the players of SHRC got the spot in the LPL, even tho they lost to Gamtee in the 2nd round and were out.  And these incidents just were in the last year, there is happening so much shit in eSports its unfathomable."

esports,3bvwbz,hMJem,2,Fri Jul 3 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"I mean, a decent amout of corruption and shit happens in every sport. But I think the biggest point is that the the growth in eSports has been asymmetrical. The majority of the money goes to teams and organizations, while the majority of the players play under their value. That leads to very little player protection. There arent many agencys, agents or laywers that work for player interests that could provide a counterbalance against the growing power of owners and companies in eSports."

esports,3bvwbz,MooseBear,4,Fri Jul 3 15:57:12 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem IMO is that very few people interact with other competitors in real life, with the exception of maybe the fighting game community. Many players have their group of online friends that they met through the game, never meet up in real life, and spend multiple hours a night playing with/against others that often live right down the street from them without ever knowing it. LAN centers used to provide this to some extent but their use has gone down hill over the years.

Half the professionally produced documentaries and articles about esports play in to this pretend idea. You can feel it in this trailer.

I understand the decision, but I would have preferred that it helped the scene directly instead of having another betting site.    If it was some tech company, the positive PR among a mostly tech savvy esports crowd would be enough for a sales spike and name recognition for future sales.  These outside investors wouldn't benefit as much from sponsoring tournaments.  The only way I'd see an otherwise outside investor investing into esports would be some mogul buying a team for the bragging rights like they currently do with NBA, MLB, etc teams.  As much as I wish that they would help the scene grow directly, it just doesn't meet their bottom line goal: maximum profit with minimal investment."

I could understand objectively disliking fantasy eSports, or betting on games in general, but I can't understand why you would be tired of these popping up lately. If it's not something you're interested in, just don't partake in it.   It expands the entire scene financially, through free-press/advertising, and expands the appeal to new potential viewers."
esports,3bmd8d,theStroh,3,Tue Jun 30 14:48:27 2015 UTC,"To be honest, direct investment or sponsorship of players/teams/events would do better in the long term.  One of the things that I've found is that people who become very good at games sometime simply can't afford to come out for events. As an example, it was a while before Smug was able to attend events even though he had started getting known beforehand. There are events that, even as great as they are, could be even better with some more financial support. There are leagues that might not have gone bellyup if they had more capital.  There are a lot of different, and IMHO better, ways to invest in exports rather than making yet another fantasy/betting site because you only care about ROI."
esports,3bmd8d,tehrebound,0,Tue Jun 30 15:07:07 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree. I would much rather see direct investment in the competitive infrastructure.   I don't see the relevance of that opinion in this discussion though. The only way it would even be relevant is if you assume that Mark Cuban and the three other investors did not choose to invest in infrastructure because of the higher ROI from this fantasy/betting site.  If that was true, then sure, I would say you have a very valid point. However when these sites/services bring in investors who would otherwise see no point in investing within the scene at all, I cannot see how someone could be ""tired"" of it, because it's almost unanimously a good thing."

esports,3bmd8d,G2Wolf,-1,Tue Jun 30 15:19:51 2015 UTC,"See my other post for a more detailed response to a similar post.  The summary of it though basically was - how is that even relevant? No one with an interest in eSports (competitor or spectator) is going to deny that they'd rather see money go towards teams/tournaments/players/etc.   However that's not something Mark Cuban would invest in at this current stage. These investments aren't detracting from investments in the scene, they're just separate.   That being said, it's hard to not see potential for this to grow the scene up. If you have power-players holding stake in betting companies, they're not going to let the ""house burn down"" as Scoots said.   If Cuban or any other investor in these sites start seeing a significant ROI diminished by lack of support for the scene, you'd no doubt see them step-up and help fund the scene out.

esports,3bmd8d,jgamboa,-1,Tue Jun 30 20:41:26 2015 UTC,"If the scene just randomly collapses, then odds are it's due to something other than lack of funding. Therefore an outside investment into the scene would not have saved it from collapsing, and the entire argument is irrelevant. If the scene collapses slowly, as I already stated but you seemed to miss, earnings from investments in side-ventures can be invested into the scene. There's basically a 0% chance that any competent investor would see the scene failing, know his entire investment depends on the scene staying alive, and not back-invest into tournaments/players/etc.    This still all fails to forego the ever-so-important basic understanding that this wasn't a detracted investment from the eSports scene. Had betting/fantasy leagues not been created, there is no guarantee that any of these investors would have ever entered the scene.   Ignoring all of that, I am curious though - what would you have seen this money go towards? Keep in mind Mark Cuban is a value investor, so there better be a return.   Tournaments? No return under the current setup due to high production costs which viewers have become acquainted with. Under smaller setups like those used by the FGC you could see a return, but it wouldn't be proportionate to the investment at all.  Players? Sure, you could sponsor players and send them to events, however I fail to see how that would ever generate a substantial return for bigger investors.  Teams? Yeah if you invest in the biggest teams possible maybe you'll see a ROI suitable for someone like Cuban's portfolio - but it would take a decent chunk of time, and there's really not a place to throw money into already established teams. Investing in new teams is a very large gamble, and is incredibly likely to fail."

esports,3bjhq9,PeanutAlmighty,3,Mon Jun 29 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"Hey, so I think this is a great idea. Imo there is a lack of 'gaming talk shows' for dota. A few things (my opinion, feel free to ignore if you don't agree)...  1) Lighting - beginning of the video was dark. Keep a constant level of light throughout the video. Well lighted videos show professionalism.  2) Use visual brackets to show the results of tournaments/games. Animations always help but are not essential (scissors cutting the losers, melting team names etc etc).  3) It's cool that you are a cloud 9 fan. However, as you gain in popularity, dial it back a bit. Nothing can turn away viewers more absolutely then watching someone rejoice when their team lost.   4) Continue to have well known dota experts/guests on the show. (Make sure they are visible.. aka lots of light). Nothing boosts your viewers and followers like another well established Dota2 profile who likes your show. Getting this friendly endorsement is the easiest way to get new viewers and its usually a win win for both sides.  5) Your logo/stamp should be all over the video to prevent others from grabbing any content.  6) Why just youtube? If possible, it makes sense to do this on twitch for a live audience. Obviously this is your choice... imo you should be doing both.  7) Prior to TI, and after the final teams are determined, it might be a good idea to release a video on each team. Strengths, weaknesses, likely hero picks, predictions etc.  Ok. So besides those minor details, I really enjoyed the show. Continue to be yourself! That is essential. Looking forward to the next one."

esports,3bf77c,TLSN_Troyseph,7,Sun Jun 28 18:04:39 2015 UTC,A good observer (cameraman/woman) is more important to me than anything else. If the casters are bad I can listen to podcasts. If the production value is bad I can ignore it. But the observer is responsible for what your audience sees and that is by far the single most important thing when looking to make a small tournament enjoyable. Good luck with your tournament and the coming R6S scene.
esports,3bf77c,Bluu_Jayy,3,Sun Jun 28 20:53:51 2015 UTC,"Highly agree, also good admins and support staff to ensure minimal delays and smooth operation of the entire event. Down time kills audiences"

esports,3bf77c,G2Wolf,4,Mon Jun 29 14:28:09 2015 UTC,"If you want to start doing it the things you need for me will be:   Admins that can handle players/sing-ins/etc. (It has a great impact on delays/problems during the cups) A site where people can sing-in/see the bracket/results. (it can be done on the external sites.)  A good observer then can handle decent quality stream. As the game will be new, you will need some caster that has knowledge of the maps/tactic options/gear setups. So he/she/they need to study the game during betas/early after release.   A good option here is to look how Dirty Cup has done it. As they started very strong (for the size and popularity of the game) and the game is still in the beta."
esports,3bf77c,Warchawk,2,Sun Jun 28 21:17:57 2015 UTC,"Aside from the gameplay, for me it's because of the history and the length tournaments have been around for.    Edit: miss read the question some how. To answer it though, what I'm looking at must be significant to what's happening in the game. I don't want to be looking at someone not getting any action. What I mean by that is that you souls need a good observer that knows the game to a high level and will switch to relevant cameras when something is happening. Production value is second, if it looks good then it's usually dismissed and it isn't an issue. If it looks bad then people will complain. So make it look as good as possible but don't invest too much time into it as the observer would be more beneficial."
esports,3bf77c,xondat,-1,Sun Jun 28 19:55:52 2015 UTC,"I think he means an individual event like MLG's first tourney into CSGO, it was successful for many reasons but is not a historic CSGO tournament"
esports,3bf77c,aztechunter,2,Mon Jun 29 00:30:34 2015 UTC,"For the love of god, find a way to stay on schedule and account for possible setbacks. If the matches are Bo5's, assume they will go to game 5 every time. No one will be mad if you're ahead of schedule but you will catch words from players and spectators if you're behind on it.  Communicate with the players, team owners, media and crew. Make sure EVERYONE knows what's going on and that you're all on the same page, where to be, what they need, what they would like. Also, hold the players accountable for being punctual and being ready to play. The last thing you want to do is have each player leave for a bathroom break 5 minutes before the match and suddenly disappear for like 20 minutes. Most tournaments are bring your own gear so obviously it's a good idea to make sure they know to be prepared but also have backups on hand as a last resort because there's always going to be that detriment who just didn't feel like bringing anything.   On that note, as a general rule ""Anything that can go wrong, WILL go wrong."" So have backup Consoles/PC's as well, extra copies of the game, extra monitors, etc etc. A while ago there was a CSGO event where several computers broke down and had to be replaced which caused a pretty long setback.   Finally, regarding tournament rules make sure there is a code of conduct for players, add penalties for rowdy/disruptive behavior but don't discourage things like casual trash talk just make sure everyone knows how to stay in line. Also, as a side note when you have to make a ruling that wasn't covered by the initial rulings (EG things like replaying maps, rounds, advantage etc etc) STICK TO THE RULE FOR FUTURE INCIDENTS. Don't just vote one way once and then do it differently in the next instance in a single event. After the event, feel free to change it."

esports,3bf77c,OneElkCrew,-4,Sun Jun 28 21:21:11 2015 UTC,It is absolutely viable as a competitive game
esports,3bf77c,EastCoast2300,7,Sun Jun 28 21:38:57 2015 UTC,"But the community just gets split up because the franchise has yearly game releases and with that, new bugs, new game to learn, more money to spend for a new release.

esports,3bf77c,OneElkCrew,-3,Sun Jun 28 21:46:12 2015 UTC,"They yearly releases don't split up the community, the fact that games come out on 5 different platforms is what splits the community. The game is definitely competitive, the problem is the platform diversity and the fact that a quarter of the stuff in the game needs to be banned for it to be competitive."
esports,3bf77c,EastCoast2300,2,Sun Jun 28 22:00:32 2015 UTC,We all know the competitive and the most superior platform.  But the game itself is not really praised for competitive by the publishers and developers. The cost of the title is a big factor too.
esports,3bf77c,OneElkCrew,2,Mon Jun 29 08:49:13 2015 UTC,"What do you mean with ""banning stuff""?"
esports,3bf77c,Twooz,3,Mon Jun 29 01:22:12 2015 UTC,"So in competitive Call of Duty, you do not play with everything that you play with in public matches. For example, there is an ability that lets you become invisible, and another that lets you see through walls for a short period. These get banned in competitive/ranked play since they are obviously not fit for a competitive game mode. Also, only a certain subset of maps out of the entire map pool are used, and some maps may only be in certain game modes (ie one map might be awesome for search and destroy but terrible for uplink so it only gets played in Snd). If you have any other questions feel free to ask, I don't mind sharing some more info!"
esports,3bf77c,EastCoast2300,2,Mon Jun 29 02:04:40 2015 UTC,Well that might have something to do with lack of counterplay. For example in Crysis you could see people from stealth and you could get some cold blooded perk to not get seen by scans!
esports,3bf77c,Twooz,-5,Mon Jun 29 13:26:38 2015 UTC,If it's not played on PC it's not a competitive game. Console shooters are just silly.
esports,3bf77c,xiic,7,Mon Jun 29 02:08:44 2015 UTC,"Why is there such a stigma with consoles that if its on consoles it can not be competitive. Call of Duty and Halo are DEFINITELY competitively viable, despite what PC only players say to pad their own egos of their gaming machine being the best."
esports,3bf77c,EastCoast2300,-7,Mon Jun 29 03:10:39 2015 UTC,"I mean, I guess if you took them seriously enough potato sack races could also be competitive.   FPS games with a controller are just a joke."
esports,3bf77c,xiic,3,Mon Jun 29 03:28:06 2015 UTC,"Can we kill this stupid opinion already?  No one is denying that the precision is lacking in comparison to PC shooters, but to deny that console shooters are competitive and viable as eSports is ridiculous.   If they were a joke, everyone would be able to play at a competitive level - yet their is an insanely high skill gap between pros in Halo or Call of Duty and ""top players"" within the rest of the community.   If it were a joke, there would be no consistency since aim is so easy and gameplay is trivial (like people often say with aim assist) - yet Call of Duty has had franchises such as Complexity which have had streaks unrivaled in any other game in terms of championships. Individual players like Scump are consistent across every Call of Duty title in being top fraggers, with a KDA that outperforms most other pro players (consistently) - thereby killing the notion that aim is not important, difficult, or that it has a low skill ceiling because of aim assist.   Look, if you don't like console shooters, that's great. But saying they aren't competitive is absolutely ridiculous and the statement has no basis.   Yes, they are gimped in terms of overall competitive factors by using a controller with aim assist, but that's like saying baseball isn't competitive because of the use of wooden bats in comparison to aluminum bats. No one denies the differences in play, but that doesn't mean it isn't viable or competitive.  P.S. Have you played recent Call of Duties on PC and on console? The most recent releases feel horrible on PC, and I can't imagine playing them competitively with a mouse & keyboard. That's in comparison to CS:GO which I could imagine would feel similarly horrible on console with a controller, and in comparison to Modern Warfare, which felt better (to me) on PC with mouse & keyboard than it did on console with a controller."
esports,3bf77c,theStroh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:14:15 2015 UTC,"How would you format that kind of tournament?  CS games last 30-90 minutes and usually formatted as a best of 3 maps decides the winner.  Siege seems like a game wouldn't last more than 20 minutes per game and only have one side per game (as opposed to the CT and T halves on CS).  It's probably not impossible, but getting the game into a format that fits esports seems like a big task."

Buying an NACS team could be $20 000 - $75 000++ depending on their social media reach and skill.   Normally every NACS team has a gaming house and get a salary. There is a lot more than just a team which has managed to qualify for NACS.   $500-$2000 per player is an ok salary, you can easily use the gaming house to put the salary a bit down when negotiating. Sponsors doesn't really put big money on the table if it's an average NACS team with no reach.   A lot of organizations seems to go for 1 available key player and build a team around that player, but it's a big risk."

esports,3babqb,WickedMakoto,-5,Sun Jun 28 01:45:14 2015 UTC,"My point is that when you're in a position where someone is giving you a media credential, you don't see it as something ""cool"" or an ""opportunity."" You've already made journalism your job, and getting ahold of your credential is just a step you have to take to be allowed to do your job. The only people who think that getting a credential is cool are wannabes."
esports,3babqb,solomute,5,Sun Jun 28 01:58:31 2015 UTC,That's just like...your opinion man. Slow your roll and take a couple shots. You're too uptight.
esports,3babqb,WickedMakoto,3,Sun Jun 28 03:15:33 2015 UTC,"Really that is just bollocks. I know I'm not the only journalist in the industry who gets excited about going to new events and visiting new places. I mean, anyone working in esports who isn't passionate about esports is a) in it for the wrong reasons and b) unlikely to be successful.  You're telling me that just because this is my profession I don't get to think it's cool that my employer is going to send me across the world to go backstage and behind the scenes at massive events in crazy cool venues?"
esports,3babqb,cleslie92,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:31:21 2015 UTC,"Look at it this way: do any of the competitors think it's ""cool"" that they're flown out to an event and allowed backstage? Of course not, they belong there, they've earned the right to be there through their hard work and dedication to their craft, and the event exists in its current form because of the role they play in competing in it. As a journalist, you're there because you belong there and have earned the right to be there through your dedication to your craft, and the event exists in its current form because of the role you play in bringing it to a wider audience.  I'm currently writing this from the tour bus of the band I'm on the road with as a sound engineer. I know exactly what it's like to be paid to travel the country to put on shows as your profession. Back home I work for a company putting on large scale concerts and events. I've worked with internationally renowned musicians in front of thousands of people. I also work in professional sports broadcasting, worked on the sidelines of every major professional sport, in post-game locker rooms, inside multimillion dollar broadcast trucks. I don't say any of this to brag, I say this so you know that I know what it is like to belong backstage. It's my passion, it's my living that I wouldn't trade for anything else. But it doesn't define me as a person, it doesn't make me ""cool"" or better than anybody else. At the end of the day it's just a job. One that I'm very good at, and that's why I get to do it for a living in a very competitive industry, but still just a job."

esports,3babqb,cleslie92,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:54:35 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point I'm trying to get across. There's a fundamental difference between the wannabe attitude of ""oh man it would be so cool to be backstage and hang out with all of those famous people"" and the professional attitude of people who actually belong backstage because their job takes them there. It is a cool job, I'm not denying that, I'm saying there's a huge difference between wishing you could be somewhere you don't actually belong, and actually earning the right to belong there. Between deriving your importance from the importance of those around you, and actually being important."

When you are in a credentialed area, you are no longer a fan. Acting like a fan in a credentialed area is a great way to have your credential taken away.  And yes, media credentials generally get you into the entire event for free."

esports,3babqb,d3_crescentia,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:13:06 2015 UTC,"As someone with experience doing this kind of stuff before: see if there's a press room.  Generally, it's a good place to get away from the action to process photos or do other work, and the internet might be better there.  Also a good place to network with other esports media people if you're into that kind of thing.   Another thing I noticed is that no one there had a tripod, except me. It was really useful during the times I needed steady shots video, but it was also bulky and heavy on my shoulder when not in use. Is that why no one uses them?   Pretty much.  Between camera, lenses, laptop (for on-the-fly processing) it's already a lot to be carrying around on your own.  Monopods are a little more common if you're out on the floor; tripods are usually reserved for sit-down interviews."

esports,3babqb,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:15:53 2015 UTC,"Some advice, as someone who's dealt with his share of press passes, both in eSports and not.   Don't lose it. Duh. Keep it visible and be quick to show it to security, the earlier the better. Keep in mind passes can be revoked, so generally not being an idiot with the access you're given is a good idea. Set up Twitter via SMS when venue wifi is shitty, or you don't have access. MMS photos will attach as photos. Go shake hands with people and generally introduce yourself. This is a great time to hand out/get business cards, Skype usernames or Twitter follows. Each one of these can translate into opportunities down the road. Mingle with fellow photogs. Ask for advice, or just questions about your craft - they will remember you, and hopefully in a good way. Keep in mind the players are there to play (duh), and may not want to talk or be disturbed. Obviously it's your job to take photos/videos, but in my experience organizers are going to prioritize the comfort of their players rather than your job; like I said, you can lose your press pass if you're being dumb. Be careful with things like disturbing/recording strategy sessions. Show players photos of them! Generally they like seeing themselves look good. Make sure to tag them in photos or tweets - it's also a really easy way to get them to follow you or retweet you, which means more exposure. Save it, build a collection, get more!   Have fun, dude. We're around the corner at theScore eSports (and we have some people at WCS); hope you're having a good time."

esports,3b8rfl,mizerr,2,Sat Jun 27 02:52:58 2015 UTC,"Money is sports is ever a good thing?  Compare esports to soccer what do they both have?  World wide appeal, a younger fervent audience willing to spend lots of money, it's a relatively easy game to pick up and understand etc.  What does soccer have that esports doesn't have or has little of so far?... Corruption. Massive corruption to the point where other countries are effected and the US/UN needed to step in. FIFA is a mess, you'd like that same mess to come to esports? Money bring bigger problems than the occasional small time esports website not paying a winning team on time.  Big Money will step in and become gatekeepers to esports and choose who makes it big and who doesn't? They'll choose which games make it and which games don't.  Think about how money and influence already persuade our game buying habits. Big Money is only here to exploit gamers and make money.  They aren't here to improve the community or the scene beyond that one driving force.  It'd be nice to think that maybe gamers would be smart enough to recognize it and not fall prey to the influence.  Most of them will though, business types know A LOT about which strings to pull to get their money's worth."

esports,3b3em3,Dorazion,5,Thu Jun 25 17:24:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand what she means.  I read the whole quote and what I got from it was this:  Because esports is relatively new, money is scarce. Therefore, one person's success at obtaining said money necessarily means another person failed at obtaining the same money. As a result, unsuccessful people find it difficult to be happy for the successful people.  If that is indeed what she means, then isn't this a pervasive issue for society as a whole? In a world were resources are scarce, one person's successful attempt inevitably means another person failed.  So this problem isn't specific to esports per se (although, to be fair, she didn't say it was). Perhaps resources are scarcer in esports than in other industries thereby amplifying the resentment."

esports,3ay99g,evolutionx1,2,Wed Jun 24 16:49:36 2015 UTC,"But does Adderall (or other stims) really provide a competitive advantage in these types of games, live or in training? Enough of an advantage to be worth cracking down on players usage?"
esports,3ay99g,G2Wolf,5,Wed Jun 24 15:56:32 2015 UTC,"If it didn't provide a competitive advantage, people wouldn't be taking it for that reason.  http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/adderall-has-become-a-popular-drug-for-athletes-trying-to-gain-an-edge/   The potential lure becomes obvious when Dr. Gary Wadler, past chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency’s Prohibited List Committee, begins listing off the benefits of Adderall to an athlete.  “It masks fatigue, masks pain, increases arousal — like being in The Zone,” begins Wadler, currently an associate professor of medicine at Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine, in a phone interview.  “It increases alertness, aggressiveness, attention and concentration. It improves reaction time, especially when fatigued. Some think it enhances hand-eye coordination. Some believe it increases the mental aspects of performance.”  That’s not to mention possible increases in acceleration, speed, strength and power that accrue to Adderall users. It’s no wonder that Wadler calls Adderall “one of the quintessential performance-enhancing drugs. There’s no question it’s a performance-enhancing drug.”     http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-08-winners-might-use-drugs   Before, I'd suffered from nerves when competing in front of an audience. The atmosphere got to me.** But when I played on Adderall and I was only focused on what was in front of me. It made me a far better player.""**  As one StarCraft player wrote in 2011 on the game's official forums: ""Adderall is basically a stimpack for gamers.""  ""It was a significantly different experience playing in a tournament while on the drug,"" he says. ""On Adderall I would never freak out. Stress had no effect. Adrenaline can be useful in eSports, but the benefits of Adderall far outweighed them.""  Under the cover of anonymity, players appear more willing to admit taking the drug as a way to improve competitive play. One poster on Battle.net, the official forums for StarCraft, wrote: ""Adderall, dexedrine, methylphenidate are basically mind steroids. I know that I personally and many friends of mine play RTS a lot better when using any of those drugs."" Another agrees: ""I use addy and play StarCraft all the time. It helps. A strong 30 mg instant release pill will send me into overdrive mode for about 10 hours straight.""     And this is just adderall. There's a few other drugs that can be abused as well for esports."

There is alot of very open talk at CoD lans about adderall that I've heard with my own ears, although the Reddit community swears its not true. The best chance at any drug resulting in a dq would be through drug testing, which is very expensive, so that's prob not in the near future."

I can't think about anything but what's going on in the game as I play, my mind becomes one with the game practically.   Outside of intense games that demand 100% of my attention and daily life in general that's where I have problems.

esports,3ay99g,eSportsAgent,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"That this moment I would say no, like others have stated; drug testing is expensive but I also don't think many players consider doing this, mainly out of fear of being removed from the team/org, especially since they know they can be ""easily"" replaced.      Also a lot of the well known players and players within well known communities probably don't attempt it because they are always being watched in a sense; whether it be their teammates, team/organization personnel, or fans. Its too much of risk for the players especially since their gaming careers don't last as long as say a football or basketball player's does. Now they would have an easier time getting away with it but the amount they have to lose is also a lot higher."

Now whether the player does not or is up them, clearly. But if the player refuses to take the drug test, I am pretty sure the org has the right to remove the player. They may not mention that is was because of drugs, but I'm sure if the org really wanted to remove a player, they would find a way to get it done."
esports,3ay99g,G2Wolf,2,Wed Jun 24 15:41:12 2015 UTC,"I mean if the org suspects that a player is using drugs, they could always ask the player to take a drug test.   No org is going to do that. Drug Tests are expensive, and if it was positive they would have to find a new player to replace him. Why would an org attempt to shoot themselves in the foot like that and risk losing a player, disturbing team synergy, risk losing out on events, being called cheaters, negative publicity, etcetc?  If a team wants to get rid of a player, they'll find a replacement and get rid of them. I'd be surprised if a team doesn't have a clause in their contracts to sub new players in. They don't have to waste hundreds of dollars to do that."

esports,3awvnv,EmpDankness,8,Wed Jun 24 03:46:08 2015 UTC,"I had a client (who I will not name) who was a female competing at a fairly high level. She ended up retiring because of the incredible amount of hate she would receive. When trying to replace a player on the team, they would need to go through a screening process of which candidate were okay with having a girl on the team, a process that should not be necessary at all.   She also had a hard time streaming because of the large number of trolls. And I'm not talking like poke poke kappa kind of trolls. I'm talking direct messages with full on sexuality harassment threats that said they were going to assault her if she didn't give up trying to play at a pro level. It was really rough.   Whether we believe it or not, there is a lot of segregation in eSports when it comes to women. And it's likely a huge reason why there aren't more pro female gamers.   One of the absolute greatest mind on this subject is T. L. Taylor. I'd find her on twitter and get her thoughts. She's super nice, and I'm sure she'd love to chat about it."

esports,3awvnv,nolanrh,3,Wed Jun 24 16:04:13 2015 UTC,"Three primary reasons: 1) Lack of visible representation in the pro scene serves as a deterrent, whereas even token representation (good example here being Whoopi Goldberg and Uhura) can serve to drive participation and barrier breakdown. Real representation obviously even more powerful. Unfortunately, even people like Sjokz are kept off the casting desk. Soe and Pansy are good tho. Just not enough, and not in all esports. 2) Environmental and cultural norms for females tend to discourage both competitive attitudes and gaming-related hobbies. 3) Gender-related harassment that is more often than not sexual and violent in nature."

esports,3awvnv,tadL,2,Wed Jun 24 09:47:38 2015 UTC,"Like many men, some women - despite having the potential - just don't want it enough, others simply aren't good enough. It's a numbers game too and there's little doubt that men largely outnumber women when it comes to playing competitively, so when you consider maybe 0.01% of men will go ""pro"" (arbitrary number), if you apply that to your original question then it's an extremely small number, which isn't even a guaranteed number anyway, but a possibility. I don't believe in female only tournaments though, you have to play with AND against the best to improve and inevitably compete with the best. Thus to limit yourself to a specific gender is to limit not the skill ceiling, but the talent pool available to build from. There's also a bunch of idiots on the internet that would discriminate between gender, but the majority of those individuals will never be on a pro level themselves. As a competitive player, I would welcome any player that would fit in with my teams dynamic no matter what their gender - all I care about is having the right player to win. From personal experience though, I've only ever met a handful of women in the games that I've competed in, so here I am full circle."
esports,3awvnv,zronvc,3,Wed Jun 24 13:22:40 2015 UTC,"Just to provide a counterpoint: Female-only tournaments are indeed dividing, but do serve some great purposes in providing visibility and role models. Women's World Cup, WPGA, WNBA, etc, have all driven a rise in popularity for those sports that encourage female participation. This obviously creates difficulty in getting those females to participate in the ""primary"" tournament, but it does have some positive impacts that shouldn't be overlooked."
esports,3awvnv,AlphaFerg,2,Wed Jun 24 16:48:56 2015 UTC,"This obviously creates difficulty in getting those females to participate in the ""primary"" tournament,   Another thing to note is that just because female-only tournaments exist, DOES NOT mean that females are banned from any other event."

esports,3awvnv,Heflamoke,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:33:59 2015 UTC,"I've done some demo-graphical survey's in the industry if anyone is interested in the statastics. The average that I personally see for women who play eSport games (LoL, CS:GO, DoTA2, etc.) is around 35%. But the numbers for women that actually compete are much smaller. For example, the last time I worked with a competition for League of Legends they had 22 teams of 5, but only two players were female.  Being a female myself, my biggest struggle with competing is that I'm just not good enough. It's possible I could be better, but I don't want to put in the time that most of the professionals do. I also struggle with strategic decision making versus sudden decision making. But this is a personal reason of why I don't play competitively, not why all women don't play competitively. Could be  good information and insight, but don't take my word for it."

esports,3att3y,BuckeyeDay,3,Tue Jun 23 13:27:42 2015 UTC,"I think there are two ways: 1) Apply directly to companies/teams (https://twitter.com/esportscareer and http://esportscareer.org/) 2) Get involved in the scene: forum mod, admin, writer(wiki or news), learn the games yourself, help organize small tournaments or create content"
esports,3att3y,OneQuestionAccount22,2,Tue Jun 23 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"Pretty much best answer someone can give, in addition, be a leader and start your own path.  The industry needs a lot of different angles when it comes to business and just need to find your niche if you wish to be an Esports Entrepreneur.   If you do go that path, I recommend doing #2 above, get the experience by volunteering or just creating credible content that help build your knowledge of esports along with your brand and reputation."
esports,3att3y,peachpicker5000,2,Tue Jun 23 16:12:04 2015 UTC,"The career pool (aside from bein a cyber athlete) is pretty broad, the business of esports has its focus on brand promotion so depending on where your interests lie you can take on the following career paths: -Esports Journalism -Social Media/Community Management -Event Organization -Live Game Commentary -Media or Video Production -Team Management -Event Production -Liaison Staff between Organizations and Partners  Specific roles would vary for each path, a solid advice one can give for anyone who wants to go into esports is to start finding your groove and produce content. Not everything will pay at first mind you, for even with the ton of money pouring in the scene most have started with voluntary work, but once you've built up enough cred then that's when you reap them fruits of your labor."

esports,3apqbv,MattDemers,2,Mon Jun 22 15:32:13 2015 UTC,"Hey there. I work for theScore eSports as a Supervising Editor, but started as a journalist, and still write occasionally. I wrote an answer to this question to someone else a couple months ago; image of the message is here.  Condensed version is to start your own blog, experiment, use it to go up a ""ladder"" to bigger opportunities while remaining consistent and self-motivated. Be kind, help other people out, and don't waste peoples' time when it comes to asking them for feedback.   Also, what would each of you be interested in reading from the perspective of a lesser-known writer? Game coverage, player profiles, interviews, editorials, and publicity articles for smaller games & teams are all ideas I've considered.   What about what you know and love. Your obscurity and beginner status means that writing about what everyone else writes will make it harder for you to get noticed. Even if you don't think it's interesting to a large, mainstream audience, it's better to show expertise in something that other people can't get into as easily.  This is what makes people who obsess about stats so unique: it's not something anyone can just jump into without research and drive.   Do any of you have tips for networking, obtaining contacts, etc?`   Twitter. I've gotten 90% of my contacts, interviews and jobs from being present on Twitter, asking good questions, avoiding wasting peoples' time and participating."
esports,3apqbv,sang_,2,Mon Jun 22 15:39:57 2015 UTC,"When you say not to waste peoples' time, I assume you mean that I should avoid nagging people for feedback, being slow with responses, etc. Is that what I should take away from that particular bit of advice or am I missing some big points?   On the topic of twitter, I have a personal twitter that I've used for 5-6 years with 20k tweets. I'm hesitant to get rid of it and start from scratch, but if someone were to dig into my tweets, they'd see plenty of unprofessional stuff. Would you advise me to make a new one or just delete anything particularly bad in my past 1000-2000 tweets?   Similarly, what standards of professionalism exist in this field? It seems very inconsistent across the board and I don't want to block opportunities for myself with things I say and do.   Thanks a ton for the advice and time."
esports,3apqbv,sang_,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:11:39 2015 UTC,"Is that what I should take away from that particular bit of advice or am I missing some big points?   It's more just knowing your audience when asking for favors, and not being too greedy with what you think you're entitled to. Going to a Dota 2 personality with a big following and hoping he'll read/share your Hearthstone article is wasting his time.   Thinking that you're owed the help getting big also hurts you because you need to pay your dues and be good at what you do; there are people in this industry who got to where they are through years of working for nothing with no attention. They don't owe you an easier time getting to the same success.  Work hard, stay humble.   Would you advise me to make a new one or just delete anything particularly bad in my past 1000-2000 tweets?   Your options are to create a new Twitter, nuke your tweets or be prepared to stand by the tweets you've made. If someone hates you enough, they will comb through it all to find something to use against you.   Similarly, what standards of professionalism exist in this field? It seems very inconsistent across the board and I don't want to block opportunities for myself with things I say and do.   Again, it's about being prepared to stand behind the things that you do or say, and how much it means to you to express those things. Sometimes if your work is good enough, people respect that and will excuse you being... different?  I guess I'm just thinking about people who are outspoken about things they're passionate about that may be controversial - by attaching that personality to your eSports writing or your brand, you're potentially alienating audiences that may disagree with you, even if your work is good.  This isn't to say that you shouldn't stand for anything - people, especially writers, should. It's just that by making it public you have to be prepared to stand by your choices because it may feed into negative perceptions, reasons to discount you as a whole, or bias your work.  If you're independent, things like cursing tend to not be as big of a deal, but even though this is my personal Reddit account, I'm representing my company because I work there using my real name. So... this post originally had a lot more curses, but I have to consider that it may reflect badly on the company to be that casual.  It isn't a ""theScore is censoring me"" thing; it's part of being professional and treating your craft like a job. It's up to you to choose how deep you want to go into it, and it's up to you to be prepared for the consequences.  Hope this helps."
esports,3apqbv,cleslie92,2,Mon Jun 22 17:28:16 2015 UTC,This is exactly what I was looking for. Thanks again.
esports,3apqbv,cleslie92,2,Mon Jun 22 18:15:47 2015 UTC,"My biggest recommendation for people who are trying to get into esports journalism is to focus less about the tactical nature of what you are trying to do and figure out what are the stories you want to tell?  Journalism is by and large about storytelling - people implicitly understand stories and stories stay with people longer. Some things to think about:  What about the story you are trying to tell is interesting? Different? Important enough that you feel the story needs to be told?  Who is involved in the story you are trying to tell? What makes them interesting? Unique? Etc. People relate to other people. If your story doesn’t have people you can make your readers care about, it won’t be successful.  At some point you are going to have to decide what kind of writer you want to be and often times it comes down to whether or not you want to write boring crap a small audience may read or something you find compelling that perhaps less people will read. More than likely you are probably going to have to do a little of both. The trick is balancing what you do for exposure with what truly interests you.  Some more recommendations:  (1) As was already mentioned, start writing. You can’t learn to surf by just reading how-tos and watching videos. Writing is an art and the only way to get good is to keep doing it over and over.  (2) Related to that, read other good writing, especially stuff outside esports. Reading good writing provides inspiration and a base to learn from. I recommend finding a site or two you like and keep up with the writing they do. Places like Medium.com are also great hubs to read quality writing. Few of my recommendations:   Sex is Sex but Money is Money Confessions of a drug addicted high school teacher The toil of foreign SC2's King Beyond the Wall   (3) Do your research. There is a lot of resources out there for CSGO so use them. I’m making the assumption that you might write about CSGO because I spent 30 seconds looking at your reddit profile and saw you posted on the subreddit before. The internet is a wonderful tool so make sure you use it.  (4) I wouldn’t make a new Twitter. People change over time and everyone has that Facebook post or Tweet they would like to have back. Unless its something that is truly unrecoverable, I would just let it be.  (5) Standards of professionalism is very loose in the esports industry. I would recommend looking toward traditional journalism standards and going from there. Despite what some may say, Esports is still a very small industry and so burning bridges is not recommended. I’m not saying you have to placate everybody, but you can definitely dislike people but still respect them.   (6) Find a way to track your content. Whether it be through hard metrics via Google Analytics or comments, find out what people think of your work. You are producing content for an audience, and while you should always stay true to yourself when you write, don’t write in vacuum. And just because people aren’t going nuts over your content doesn’t mean people don’t like it. When I first started writing in esports my editor told me for every person who posts a negative comment to the article you write, there are ten more people who read it and enjoyed it. To this day, I generally believe that to be true.   If all this seems like a lot and overwhelming, don’t get freaked out. The simple truth is this:  Write compelling stories. There is an old adage that “game recognizes game.” If you write good shit, everything else will fall in place.  My background: esports journalist since about 2004. Wrote about a variety of games: cs, cod, quake, starcraft, dota, etc. Senior editor at Amped eSports and Gameriot. Former Content lead for Team Pandemic, head admin for CEVO, and managing editor at ESFI World."
