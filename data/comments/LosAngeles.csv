It's being marketed as something that most of us can agree upon, for now. Should a fire department be allowed jurisdiction over the immediate airspace near an active fire? Sure. However, other agencies with ulterior motives could push for provisions to expand the scope of authority by employing vague language. For example, legislation can be worded to allow for a drone to be legally taken down if it is perceived to be a threat to public safety, or something like that. What's the problem? ""threat to public safety"" or similarly vague wording is too open to interpretation for law enforcement to exploit. Would a drone filming at a protest conveniently fall under this interpretation? I know this is a straw man as I haven't read the actual proposition. Do they deserve the benefit of the doubt? I don't know, but something to think about."

That could potentially make a bad fire situation much worse.  Also, these multi rotor aircraft can be MUCH larger and heavier then the little DJI toy-copters you are probably thinking of.  They can easily get into the 50 lb range and could be a huge hazard for anyone on the ground that it may come down on.

Colonization and growth was the product of Americans like John Sutter, John Bidwell, John Marsh, and Thomas Larkin, among others, who loved California (generally speaking) and wanted it to be a part of the Union. The Natives here never exercised any claim to the land (by choice), and built no permanent settlements. The populations of these native people was so small, and the land so expansive, it was rare to even run across them.   What is ironic is that the original American settlers who came over the passes or through the Old Spanish Trail were deported by Mexico due to their lack of papers if they couldn't use their influence (bribe, persuade) with the Mexican authorities to allow them to stay. Relations between Californios, the Mexicans, and the new American settlers was actually good, all of them living in generally harmony despite their cultural diversity."

Too much breeding can create bad strains of animals and have more health and neurological issues that can lend to this. Unfortunately good training can't solve the problem. We don't completely understand the dog psyche to know the potential triggers for any dog.  Unfortunately due to their size pits can cause more damage than chihuahuas. If chihuahuas were bigger it'd be the same unfortunate situation. Chihuahuas have been bred poorly far too much as well and are quite aggressive, but since they are so small they don't as much harm. It's well known in the veterinary field and overall that chihuahuas are snappy and can be aggressively fearful.   However I do hope that this owner does get what he deserves, because anyone who has an aggressive dog that causes any harm to another living thing is not okay. The fact that he left speaks even louder volumes. I hope something is done for others' safety."

Limiting ownership of specific breeds has been suggested by some to reduce injuries (e.g., pit bull type, German Shepherd Dog) however there is no evidence that breed-specific bans reduce the rate or severity of bite injuries the community.      Furthermore:     Breed is a poor sole predictor of dog bites. Controlled studies reveal no increased risk for the group blamed most often for dog bites: ‘pit bull-type’ dogs.  Accordingly, targeting this breed or any another as a basis for dog bite prevention is unfounded. As stated by the National Animal Control Association: “Dangerous and/or vicious animals should be labeled as such as a result of their actions or behavior and not because of their breed.”     Have a read... from the American Veterinary Medical Association: https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/LiteratureReviews/Pages/The-Role-of-Breed-in-Dog-Bite-Risk-and-Prevention.aspx"

LosAngeles,3e0u71,Radiobamboo,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:46:23 2015 UTC,"You're fucking crazy it absolutely is the owner that trains the dog. Just like a parent teaches a child how to behave. Chihuahuas are way more aggressive than pitbulls and if they had the power behind them there would be countless more instances of hospitalizations by them then there would be pitbulls. The only reason pits do more damage is because of how strong they are but any little dog I've had or anyone I know has had has been more aggressive than any out I've ever known. Of course if you train them to be aggressive your going to have a monster on your hands but if you train them properly they're like little kids. I'm sure you've never even spent time with one, why don't you try finding someone you know who has properly trained their dog and maybe they change your pigheaded view. And don't worry about my grandma she loves her best friend as much as he loves her, oh and as for kids my little cousins love him and the most damage he's ever done to them is whip them with his tail because he was so excited to see them."

Chihuahuas are way more aggressive than pitbulls   So you're saying the breed does matter?  It's irrelevant whether chihuahuas are more aggressive than pit bulls, because as you said they don't have the size to back it up and are easily controllable.  How come pit bull attacks occur so disproportionately more often than other breeds of similar size?  All dogs have the possibility of suddenly turning aggressive. Pit bulls have simply demonstrated time and time again that they are more likely to do so than other breeds, and they have the mass and jaws to do serious damage when they do. Failing to acknowledge that makes you a tremendously irresponsible dog owner."

When the pay was better, being an Uber driver was an attractive option even for those who were already making pretty good money at their primary jobs. Nowadays, the pay is kind of ""okay"" for a gig that allows for flexible hours, but the reduced wages means drivers strongly have to consider the amount of wear'n'tear they'll be putting on their car. Many old drivers feel that it's no longer worth doing. However, there has been a surge of new drivers and Uber still might be an attractive option for college students just trying to make ends meet.  With fares being cheaper and drivers getting paid less, a lot of drivers have argued that the service has been ""cheapened"". On a rare occasion, passengers will tell me of their experience with drivers that speak little to no english and seem to blatantly ignore GPS. I've also read posts from drivers talking about an increase of younger passengers with bad manners. I didn't mind the changes until they removed the hourly guarantee pay. Ever since then, there's been no incentive for me personally to drive around low-income areas. Nowadays I find myself cancelling on lots of low-rated passengers just to avoid any uncomfortable situations."

It doesn't make sense to say ""black people are uncivilized murderers"" just because ONE black person was actually a murderer. Same goes for cops.

You're basically judging all of law enforcement (500,000+ people) because a few dozen actually are assholes.   It doesn't make sense to say ""black people are uncivilized murderers"" just because ONE black person was actually a murderer. Same goes for cops.

LosAngeles,3e2lkn,crabcosa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:52 2015 UTC,I found some really cool places in angelino heights/ echo park. I've been told the buses aren't that reliable though. Do you bus for daily commute? Any places to avoid? This was one of my top choices to explore on foot to find some deals since I love the look of those older homes!
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,pacifictime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:48:50 2015 UTC,"I've been told the buses aren't that reliable though.   There are so many buses running down Sunset, you'd be totally fine. Just use the Metro app (or my favorite, Transit) for real-time info."
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,crabcosa,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"^ Agreed. It's generally pretty reliable since there are two routes on Sunset with service every 15 minutes (theoretically). It can sometimes be longer than that between buses due to bunching, but it's usually not a big deal. I generally just check Transit once to make sure I'm not going to be waiting around longer than I need to.   I bus every day! Door-to-door Echo Park to Pershing is ~20-25 min. Afternoon can be a bit slower (especially with Dodgers traffic), but it usually doesn't take longer than ~35-40 min. Not as reliable as Metro, but certainly not bad."

LosAngeles,3e2lkn,Thighpaulsandra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks I figured that but I'm trying to find which lines are better. Is living along the gold line viable? Which neighborhoods are more walk able once you get off the metro. That sorta thing would be helpful to know prior to my initial visit.  Walking to the metro across large highway is vastly different from walking to the metro in a more dense neighborhood, ya know? are all lines equal?"
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,Thighpaulsandra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:22 2015 UTC,"I'm on the red line, about halfway between western and Vermont.  It's a 10 min walk to the metro and about a 15 - 20 minute ride to downtown.  Almost everything I want to do is either within walking distance or a metro ride.  My wife takes the metro home each day from NoHo.  Not sure about the gold line but I'm a huge fan of the metro system overall.  I would suggest renting an airbnb along one of the lines.  Give it a test run."
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,pcar773,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:19:58 2015 UTC,Thats the plan this august. Thanks for the tips!
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,Thighpaulsandra,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:02 2015 UTC,"If you look at a map of the Red Line, go to where you see the Vermont/ Sunset Station.   Between that station and the Hollywood/Western Station is a good start.  Stay above (north) of Sunset, so look on streets like Berendo, Edgemont, Vermont.  Don't look on Normandie, and don't look below Sunset.  The places on Fountain below Sunset look really reasonable on Padmapper, but I would stay away.  East of Vermont is ok, but stay above Fountain.  The commute on the Red Line is a breeze.  It won't take you 45 minutes to get from Los Feliz to downtown.  From the Vermont/Sunset station to 7th Street is about 12 minutes on the subway.  I know pcar773 said East Hollywood rocks and I do respect his opinion.  However, there is a bit more crime in that area than Los Feliz.   LA has pockets that are very different economically but also are very close together.   I live on Edgemont, one block up are million dollar homes, but 2 blocks down its gang territory.  It's nothing to be afraid of, but I was actually stopped by the cops walking up to my block.  They asked me wheat the hell I was doing walking.  I'm like, the bus dropped me off.  They told me to keep walking and don't be there again at night, this was at about 8:30pm.  Pcar773 is a dude with a wife,  (and he's a great person!  No issue with him or his comments!) but if you are a girl living alone, like me, I would stick to Los Feliz and maybe not East Hollywood.   I take public transit and ride my bike all over LA too.  But if you have a car, get a place with parking.  It's a must or thou life shalt sucketh."
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,jugaar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:41:51 2015 UTC,awesome advice. Thanks so much!  How do you like riding the metro later in the night alone? I'm coming from Philly but I tend to just grab a cab closer to 10pm when I'm alone. I'm assuming its similar. Your input is super helpful!
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,lawvas,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:33:44 2015 UTC,"I've ridden the subway really late at night and been fine.  I've also ridden my bike alone late at night and had no problems.  One night at about 2am, I rode my bike home all the way from Beverly Hills to Los Feliz.  Now, you still have to be smart, as I'm sure you know being from Philly.  Don't be on the subway with your head buried in your phone, pay attention to the people around you.  Don't go walking at night alone with your headphones on, head on a swivel always alert.  I've caught the bus at Vermont and Sunset at 3am to go to the Westside and been fine.  When I first moved here, I was on a waiting list for a parking space.  So sometimes I would walk blocks back to my place after parking my car.  The only people around would be 4-6 old Armenian dudes, smoking and shooting the shit on the corner.  They would give me a nod as I went by.  That's the ""informal"" neighborhood watch.   Hell, some Armenian dude in a silver car helped my get my bike back after some dudes tried to steal it at the .99 Cents Only Store on Sunset and Hobart.  My point, and I do have one, is just to be smart.  Go with your gut.  Every time you don't listen to your instincts, you lose a little bit of that instinct.  It's relatively safe here, just don't put yourself in a vulnerable situation.  You should be able to find a studio at a reasonable rate near the Red Line."
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,jitatime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:19:21 2015 UTC,thanks for the feedback. This is pretty much what I am expecting and I'm comfortable with that.

LosAngeles,3e2lkn,newacount,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:37:35 2015 UTC,It's funny how fast neighborhoods change.  I'd say anything north of Hollywood is alright though.  Lots of old Armenian grandmothers.  It's good to keep an eye out no matter what neighborhood a person is in.
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,cndoyle87,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"You are right.  But that corner of Santa Monica and Edgemont scares me.   At least 2 people killed there in the last few years, you know, shot after being asked where they were from.  However, someone ran over a pedestrian heading east on Santa Monica at Normandie a few years ago.  The driver was drunk and kept going, crashing at Santa Monica and Edgemont.  Driver jumped out of the car and took off. Some guy with longish blonde hair saw the crash and chased the guy down Edgemont and caught him!  Another car followed the 2 of them and helped bring the drunk back to the scene.  The news interviewed the guy who chased him and he was really humble.  I thanked him on his FB page.  I was glad he chose to get involved, even though it was a bit risky.  A bunch of us girls thought he looked like Thor with that blonde hair, all heroic and stuff, ha ha!"
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,gradschoolbound,2,Tue Jul 21 19:36:19 2015 UTC,Yeah. I live in Highland Park about a block from the gold and it's like 10 minutes or less to downtown. It's great.
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,LA_Metro_Operator,2,Tue Jul 21 15:13:54 2015 UTC,You could also consider living near a goldline stop in Pasadena or Highland Park.  You could definitely find something walkable in one of those areas where you didn't need a car.
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,pcar773,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:46:38 2015 UTC,"Wonderful part about working in dtla, do many buses/trains go into dtla. One hour in all directions? To the north noho/burbank, to the east south pasadena/Alhambra, to the south long beach/Disneyland, to the west culver/palms"
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,pcar773,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:00 2015 UTC,"I would say also add Pasadena to the list. The commute time is about 20 minutes to Union Station, and another 10 minutes from there to Downtown. If you hunt around, you can find a good 1 bed room apartment for around $1200 near Old town (specifically, near the Del Mar/Filmore Gold line station). Try staying South of 210 freeway, and West from Sierra Madre Blvd. Those are the spots which are close to old town and the Metro line.   Old town is really walkable and all and all a nice place. It is not quite dense as Downtown though, so looking for a studio in downtown is also a good option. I don't think that you'd find any thing for $1200 in DTLA, at least that was the case when I was looking around a year back."

LosAngeles,3e2lkn,pcar773,2,Tue Jul 21 18:34:17 2015 UTC,"Just curious, why is your budget so low? You could afford a decent to nice 1BR in Los Feliz or Silver lake on that salary. Especially if you are taking Metro to work, you have wiggle room to live pretty close to transit and still be in prime spots of the central city.   While it would be nice to save the money I personally can't see myself being truly satisfied and safe in the areas of LA where $1,200 is enough alone. I tried living super cheap my first year here and was bored/miserable.   There's some really good advise in this thread. Best of luck!"
LosAngeles,3e2lkn,jitatime,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:25:14 2015 UTC,"I'm trying to be frugal because I'm coming from a city (Philadelphia) where the COL is significantly lower. 65k is pretax. 65k after taxes is about 1700 per pay period or 3400 a month. I did the whole 30% of your monthly pay and came to around 1350 a month. I'm relocating without significant savings, just a lump sum bonus. Need to save for util/car so I can expand my neighborhood search next lease.  This is all still my pre-visit research so things will likely change once I see the neighborhoods where 1200 is getting me lol. I hear the rough parts of LA don't compare to even the niceish parts of philly so I'm ok with living in a neighborhood with a bit of litter. Hesitant about the homeless (panhandlers bum me out)  I appreciate all the advice. Thanks for the luck!"

The staff is friendly too.   Also small guns aren't best for lady shooters. Bigger full size guns are easier to shoot because their weight soaks up recoil really well. Small guns kick more because they are light.  I used to be a range officer and the guns women did well with were always full sized striker fired guns.   Get nothing smaller or lighter than a Glock 19. Try out a few guns and see which are comfortable for both of you to hold. You can also ""dry fire"" the gun to get a taste of the trigger. Gun World lets you do that. Ask first though."

I went from downtown Culver City to here, so I miss DTCC often, especially since so many new restaurants are opening there.    It's a somewhat safe neighborhood, although, like most parts of LA, at night it can be a little sketch.  With the metro nearby, there are always a lot of people, coupled with a ton of cars since La Cienega is right there as well.    It is nice being so close to the metro, though - and when it opens to Expo Phase 2 it should be even better.  There are interesting new developments at La Cienega/Jefferson at the old radio station lot and even more at the culver city stop.   Honestly, though, hoping for more gentrification."

LosAngeles,3dzf8f,Manning01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:47:33 2015 UTC,"The increase in value will most likely outpace the increase in taxes, due to Prop. 13.  Prop. 13 puts a limit on the assessed value of your home, meaning when the county assessor comes to put a price tag on your house to calculate your property tax bill, you will be paying as if the home were worth much less.  Prop. 13, when enacted, reset every property's assessed value to 1976 levels (until sold), set the tax rate statewide to 1% of the sale value (in 1976), and capped the annual increases to no more than 2%.  If you have owned your home continuously since 1976, you may theoretically be paying 1% on an assessed value of $30,000, when in today's market your home may actually be worth half a million."

LosAngeles,3dzf8f,kobenator,0,Tue Jul 21 15:22:06 2015 UTC,"So it's basically move to make room from the people who didn't want in their neighborhood forcing you to create a ""black Beverly Hills"" in the first place or suck it up and welcome the people who didn't welcome you in the first place because NOW it's desirable?  Cool...."
LosAngeles,3dzf8f,eightyeighther,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:56:36 2015 UTC,dont try and make this into some kind of social justice bullshit. we are now 3 or 4 generations removed from legal segregation. the people who 'forced' the creation of black beverly hills are probably dead and they certainly arent the ones who are trying to move back in.  im not trying to say there are not serious issues of racism and segregation that still exist. just that this is not one of them.  this is a situation of when a house goes up for sale more than just one ethnicity is interested in buying it. no one is forcing black people out. groups that were not okay in living in black communities now are and are choosing to do so. thats the exact opposite of racism.
LosAngeles,3dzf8f,kobenator,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:30:54 2015 UTC,Nothing racist about it. Never said it was. I think there's more to it then a house in a nice area becoming available though. I think it says a lot that even  historic black neighborhoods can't be just that. There's a sense of community in predominantly minority communities but that goes to the wayside to accommodate people with money.
LosAngeles,3dzf8f,eightyeighther,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:16 2015 UTC,"we moved to inglewood in the late 80s. in the early 90s we moved to north inglewood. north inglewood is/was like a more affordable ladera heights/view park. it was predominately middle class black families that just couldnt make it to ladera or view park. the only exceptions were the old white people who never left during the white flight.  there is and was that sense of community that you describe. lots of block parties on holidays, always welcoming of neighbors.  in the 00s and especially after teh financial crisis a lot of hispanics moved in to the neighborhood.  in the last couple years a lot of whites have moved into the neighborhood.  those block parties and sense of community are stronger then i have seen them in the almost 30 years ive been here.  so i strongly disagree with your statement. if the sense of community dissolves when new people move in, then it never really existed."

LosAngeles,3dzf8f,scrapsmegee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:32:04 2015 UTC,in regards to whats going on view park. definitely downplaying this whole race thing. the issue here is money. not community or african american history or anything else. its money.
LosAngeles,3dzf8f,kobenator,3,Tue Jul 21 17:39:50 2015 UTC,"When white areas get more minorities, it creates diversity. When minority areas get more white people, it is called gentrification with a negative connotation. The color of the skin shouldn't matter unless you are racist. What matters more is wealth. That is what creates real issues when rich people overtake poor areas. The media and the black population is looking at this all wrong."
LosAngeles,3dzf8f,Musingmike,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:58:11 2015 UTC,"The article states that some middle class blacks moved into that specific neighborhood because they were legally and socially not allowed to move into places like Beverly Hills.  So why is it okay for middle class whites (and its not only whites doing this) to decide that now it's a good neighborhood to move into after decades of neglect.  I usually don't like to make my opposition to gentrification revolve around race, but that is a reason why it has a negative connotation.  Ethnic communities such as this one exist for a reason, and its not okay for people to simply come in and break up the culture that has developed there.  That's why I don't like when gentrification happens.  For the most part the people coming in are trying to create their own communities, which will eventually displace the existing one."

Go have a meal at many places in Beverly Hills or near the Paramount Lot and you are almost sure to see some real celebrities. If not at least you get a meal out of your money.

LosAngeles,3e2uei,arffarffarff,3,Tue Jul 21 15:50:41 2015 UTC,"A lot of people ask me how to move to LA, how much money should they save up, etc. And the answer is always, more than you think. People need to plan this out.  You can use public transit as long as you live near a good hub, or at least near a solid bus line to connect you to one. Bike + Public Transit will do you well. A monthly pass is 100 bucks, good if you use it daily, otherwise 1.75 a trip with 2 hours of transfers is golden. For food, you'll be living on basic staples (rice, beans, bananas, cheap and filling) but might also get lucky through assistance of some kind to liven that up from time to time. The 99 cent store is an amazing place and sells legitimate food options.  Clothing. Goodwill, donations etc. Hopefully you're within straight sizes because otherwise that'll be a pain in the ass. As for living situation. You might get lucky and be able to stay in someone's living room for a couple hundred, or have a partitioned space in a living room with a few other people.    You won't be going out. You won't be very comfortable. You won't likely enjoy LA. I don't understand why you'd want to move here if you can't enjoy the city. There are better options for living frugally."

LosAngeles,3dy6qi,FadedAndJaded,2,Mon Jul 20 16:34:29 2015 UTC,were you driving like an asshole to deserve it? Hope you came out of that ok
LosAngeles,3dy6qi,somedudeinlosangeles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:46 2015 UTC,"Nope.  I'm not an aggressive driver at all.  Besides I was on the way back from the beach and was super relaxed.  A motorcyclist rode past me on the 5 freeway near Griffith Park.  As they rode by -- dude driving, girl on the rear -- the female put her middle finger up in the air.  So, I looked in my side view mirror to see  who she was flipping off.  I didn't see anyone that looked angry, so I kept driving.  About a minute later, a BMW pulls alone side me and I look over.  Some dude is there looking back at me.  He flips me off and I look back at him with a ""What?"" look on my face.  He swerves towards me and I don't react and then he cuts into my lane, brake checks me and takes off."
LosAngeles,3dy6qi,DTLAsmellslikepee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:55 2015 UTC,We're you doing 40 in the left lane or something? Odd that two people would flip you off for no reason whatsoever.
LosAngeles,3dy6qi,KukiMunstr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:54 2015 UTC,Negative. Probably 65-70 in the #2 lane.   Dude in the Bimmer was def the one flipped off by homegirl. I can only assume. After he took after from brake checking me he sped off darting in and out of lanes.

I'm saying all of this as an Apatow fan, but I'm not sure why Apatow has to shoe horn in a ticking clock/race against time for a character to get from one place to another in EVERY movie. A dash to the airport before someone gets on a plane! A chase scene to convince the love interest that he's not a pervert!  It was especially pointless here, but whatever. I'm glad Amy Schumer got this movie out of the way and that it was a commercial and critical success. Now she's A list and she can do what she wants. I'm interested to see what it'll be."

LosAngeles,3dv0b9,HeloRising,27,Sun Jul 19 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"Guess I could've been an unlucky victim last night.  Was picking up on Main st. in Santa Monica. Had to look around since the passenger put in the wrong spot (as usual). While making a turn I notice two girls (which I saw standing on the corner while passing by) try to get into a black car in front of me. I stick my head out the window and ask if one of them is X. They rush into my car and the first thing they say is that some crazed homeless guy is following them. I look to my left and see an odd, scruffy guy at my window....""CAN I GET A RIDE?"" No, get away from my car. He flicks me in the ear and I drive off. They said it looked like they had something sharp. I dropped them off at a very close corner with a police car so they can report it. Turned out they weren't the passengers I was looking though. They just happened to be pretty frightened by the guy.  This entrapment business is shady as fuck. I don't have automatic locks so I can't really prevent unconfirmed names from just stepping in. I always ask as they're approaching the car or just opening the door. In that situation I didn't mind helping them out especially since they seemed a bit shaken but definitely gotta be careful out there. Some people have no problems with stepping into your car even if you're not their driver. A couple of drunks in the area realized I wasn't their Uber as I waited for another person but wanted a ride anyways."

Is the competition really so fierce the other cab companies are fighting them so hard? Or are they just so much cheaper? I already know their employment structure is different, so wtf is going on there?"
LosAngeles,3dv0b9,Spokebender,3,Mon Jul 20 02:45:03 2015 UTC,They don't have to pay the same startup fees that regular cabs to.
LosAngeles,3dv0b9,Jimbozu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:54:18 2015 UTC,That's the same reason banks suck so badly. Because it's so expensive with the startup fees to compete with them.

LosAngeles,3dv0b9,Spokebender,2,Mon Jul 20 05:54:14 2015 UTC,"I believe the city of Los Angeles has about 2000 cab medallions, the cost of the medallion varies but can go upwards of $250k...to the highest bidder."
LosAngeles,3dv0b9,razmig,4,Mon Jul 20 02:49:28 2015 UTC,"NYC is six figures. L.A decals could go for about 70k at the highest (though not so much these days). Dues to the franchise company (which all L.A cabs have to operate through) are about $1000/mo, plus fees for insurance, the meter shop, and vehicle maintenance of a higher caliber than is required of Ubers (even minor stuff like cosmetic damage, dents, or a cracked side mirror must be fixed ASAP: you can't get away with anything not up to code on airport days, which often means immediately replacing a whole bumper or side mirror because you can't wait for what might otherwise simply require a small plastic part or switch). For lease drivers, the expenses of ownership, of course, get passed on, costing about $60-100 per day in lease."
LosAngeles,3dv0b9,PSteak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:17:32 2015 UTC,That's a pretty substantial reason for Uber's success then. Progress frowns on monopolies.
LosAngeles,3dv0b9,Spokebender,3,Mon Jul 20 08:14:33 2015 UTC,"They aren't technically a cab service (they are a ride sharing service) so the drivers don't have to have a cab or livery license. I don't know how much they cost in the US, but in the UK it costs something like 200k (I think its similar in New York, probably much cheaper in California, but still not insignificant."
LosAngeles,3dv0b9,Jimbozu,-1,Mon Jul 20 05:23:39 2015 UTC,"Ah, ok. Then the law itself needs an adjustment to cover them too.  Which would probably be fought over in court forever, huh?

LosAngeles,3dzt5p,wherestherain,0,Tue Jul 21 01:01:49 2015 UTC,Yes.  The cheapest option is using Uber Pool (1 or 2 people). It'll be under $30 each way if you choose that option and probably around $40-50 each way if you do UberX.
LosAngeles,3dzt5p,meepgiraffe,0,Mon Jul 20 21:54:06 2015 UTC,"UberPool is only for specific regions, isn't it?   OP, if you're taking a few people it's probably not bad. There is a bus from Downtown but it takes hours. I took an Uber home from Santa Ana once, the plan was just to get back to Disney and catch the last bus Downtown but my driver was totally cool with driving to LA. Maybe check with the Driver first.

I would bike up there almost every weekend if I felt safe, but every time I have it has felt like dying is a matter of ""when"" not ""if.""  As a metro area, we need to reassess every area that doesn't consider the most basic form of human transportation as a default, then build up. We got excited about cars for a few decades. I don't blame us. They're convenient. But now we need to tip the scale back toward balance, and we'll have to do it despite the surprising number of people who are still incapable of understanding what the problem is."

LosAngeles,3dwe0z,throwaway75647456,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:31:38 2015 UTC,You can thank prison realignment and prop 47 for the increased crime rate. Police can only do so much. Once somebody is arrested it is up to the DA/CA and the courts to put them away. Gang members get arrested now and are out 3 days later with summary probation because the voters have made the justice system toothless.
LosAngeles,3dwe0z,throwaway75647456,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:04:13 2015 UTC,"No, Charlie Beck, that's not the only problem here.  Beck comes on here often and uses a throwaway account.  LA had drug, gang violence and organized crime way before Prop 47, this is more about politicians engaging in corruption and people within the community who have money undermining and hamstringing law enforcement for their own gratification.  It's about the chronic, long term mismanagement of tax payer dollars and the failure by local government to provide vital social services, affordable housing and quality medical care that meets the publics' needs."
LosAngeles,3dwe0z,kobenator,2,Mon Jul 20 05:14:49 2015 UTC,"HA, I'm definitely not a fan of any LAPD leadership above divisional level. I agree with you on certain points but you have to admit that there has been a sharp increase in all around crime  which correlates directly with prop 47. All I am saying is that most (not all) LAPD street cops are doing their best to keep crime in check. Its very frustrating to see but most of the time gangsters are out of jail before the arrest report is even written. Then half of the time the DAs/CAs find a half ass reason not to file the case because they're allergic to actual work. If the case ends up going in front of a judge, the judge most often goes with some kind of probation or maybe up to 2 months in county.   All I'm trying to say here is that its very easy to blame the police but there is alot more going on there. If you want to throw blame around direct it at LAPD leadership, Mayor Garcetti and The City/District Attorney. Don't lump all cops in with them because most of them go to work and do the best they can with the ever decreasing amount of backing they get from command staff and politicians."

LosAngeles,3dwea1,MikeBigJohnson,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:21:21 2015 UTC,many are getting them back for free or almost free.. as the CHP found out what happened when people went to pick them up and jumped in..   this was a first for the CHP with that many cars were people just left them..   what really sucked is the people who blocked the emergency lane on the right shoulder..  that prevented any emergency vehicles from getting thru.. i wonder if the fire trucks in that area might actually start carrying sets of GO JACKS.. these are devices that can slip under the front and rear of a passenger car or pickup truck tire.. pump the lever and the rollers come in and lift the tire off the ground allowing the vehicle to be easily pushed.. only trick is.. if its on a grade.. you only use 3.. not 4.. and allow the vehicle to pivot on the locked drive wheel the emergency crews have selected to be the pivot point.  two will allow most cars to be moved.. just thoughts.. it probably won't happen again.. i would imagine that the CHP will instantly close that road with any possible fire nearby much faster than they did.  the last time this happened was in a malibu fire.. where people were escaping from the pepperdine road and managed to drive thru the fire crossing the road.. a lot of the cars actually caught fire as they drove thru the flames. many cars actually died from lack of oxygen. i think a few people died in that event..  hopefully caltrans and CHP will review both events and figure out a plan to share with local fire departments.

LosAngeles,3duslr,LAFD,19,Sun Jul 19 18:10:28 2015 UTC,"/u/ISBN_10_0441783589,   Merely as some background...   Television news helicopters often capture video from a great distance - and in a steady hover, thanks to their expensive telephoto lens and camera stabilization equipment.   If we understand correctly, the fire helicopters from allied agencies (LAFD was not on that fire) had top priority targets distant from the 'dramatic' images of the burning cars that were sadly already a total loss.   Firefighting helicopters are rarely used in the defensive operations you describe (placing retardant slurry on unburned vegetation distant from flames - that's typically a task for fixed wing air tankers) and instead are largely focused on high-speed sorties for precise low-altitude drops of water or water/foam on active fire.   While it's sad to lose a vehicle - and much can be speculated in hingsight, we must not overlook the most important factor in this fire: There were no serious injuries. Good and bad, everything else that happened is secondary to that important fact.   We don't have much if anything else to offer on this fire, as our agency was again, not a participant in the battle.   Respectfully Yours in Safety and Service,   Brian Humphrey Firefighter/Specialist Public Service Officer Los Angeles Fire Department  Yes, LAFD has an official subreddit at /r/LAFD"

I am just wondering what the specific SOPs of CDF's policy regarding drones are. Do they completely ground flights or stay a certain distance away? Regardless I am not blaming CDF for what happened I am just interested.

Depending on how you want to live, you can get a decent apartment in the valley or in the outskirts of DTLA and if you own your car, still have plenty of disposable income to vacation. Rents here are from 1250-3000 depending on the area and areas are vastly different from each other even in close proximity.

LosAngeles,3duzc1,jitatime,3,Sun Jul 19 19:03:31 2015 UTC,"HMM i didnt know this, i might try this now.   What happens if I do not load a pass before my previous pass expires?  For each ride between the expiration of your pass and the purchase of a new pass you will be charged the $1.75 1-Way Trip rate to the credit or debit card provided during the sign up process.

Why wouldn't Metro make this information a bit more accessible and promote it? What happened to trying to increase ridership?  The 7-day pass is $25. If you take two one-way trips (including transfers )for seven days paying the regular rate, that's $24.50. The 30-day pass without ""Zone 1"" is $100, which is less than the $105 you'd spend in regular fare if you took two one-way trips each of those 30 days so I guess there's that.  I wonder, does it make you purchase the 7-day pass at least once before it reverts to this pay-as-you-go system?"
LosAngeles,3duzc1,DIARY_OF_A_TRAP_GOD,3,Sun Jul 19 19:59:30 2015 UTC,"Id buy a pass just to not hold change. I see tons of people paying 2 dollars.

LosAngeles,3dx8b8,smbissett,16,Mon Jul 20 07:50:38 2015 UTC,"From a New Yorker who just moved to LA...   You will spend an insane amount of time in your car. Estimate the time you think you'll be in your car each day, and double that.  You think your commute is going to be 30 minutes each way? You are wrong, it's going to be an hour each way. You think it's going to take 20 minutes to get somewhere because it's 1am and no one else is out? Wrong, it's going to take you an hour because for some reason there is traffic at 1am. Trying to get to the store a mile down the street? Oh no, it just started sprinkling and everyone forgot how their vehicles work, that's a 20 minute drive.  My two suggestions are:  1) Get a car that you will be comfortable sitting in, ALONE, for 2-3 hours a day. I emphasize alone because in NYC, your entertainment on a commute can be the sights and sounds of the train or the city. That's not the case here. You are isolated in your car, you create your entire environment. Make sure the AC works, the radio works, there is plug for a phone charger (waze/Google maps drains your battery, and you will using these apps constantly, especially when you first arrive).  2) Get a car that has good city mileage. Hybrids are great (Prius' are everywhere) because most of the time, you'll be driving under 30 MPH and you can use the electric motor and save gas.  tl;dr: you're going to spend an insane amount of time in your car. Splurge a little now and do whatever it takes to be comfortable in your vehicle."
LosAngeles,3dx8b8,madproof,2,Mon Jul 20 08:31:16 2015 UTC,"This.  Great advice.  Had an 88 Camry, no AC for the first 7 years I lived here.  I sucked it up, but after a while it became unbearable.  Now I have AC, leather seats, nav, 6 CD changer.  Madproof is spot on, you will spend a lot of time in your car.  Not everyone lives within walking distance of where they live.  Plus, are you only going to work?  Lots of stuff to do and see in CA, get a decent car with good gas mileage, AC, and a decent stereo and you'll be happy.  If you do get a car, your apartment must have a parking space or you'll hate LA.  Good luck!"

I should just stop being friends with them and create a social life around my neighborhood instead?  My work should be a 20-30 minute drive. It's 7 miles away, and reverse commuting. It still takes me an hour a couple times a week. What can I do about that? I moved to this area because of the short commute. That doesn't mean it's always short.  I'm just trying to prep the guy as someone who just came from the same situation. NYC is completely different. Transportation there is 20-45 on a train to get anywhere you need to go. There are rarely variables. It's very tough to get used to sitting in a car alone, not knowing if you're 20 minute commute is going to be 20 minutes or an hour and 20 minutes today."

Instead of preparing a new resident for that, I'd do my best to make sure they aren't going to have to live that lifestyle.    Now, I'm not saying you're wrong for choosing to do things your way.  It sounds like you're happy with it, and at the end of the day, what else matters?

I once saw a man tap his breaks and a motorcycle slammed into his trunk like right next to me. Not to mention, weve got biker gangs, I live a couple houses from some mongols, I even know some, I've heard stories of them just backing a truck up to a bike, hoisting it up and driving off. Bottom line, people drive like shit in Los Angeles, everyone will agree with that. Get a car that's good on gas milage, you'll be driving a lot and for potentially lengthy bits of time.

With proper gear and training (get into a motorcycle safety course) you can keep yourself super safe. Obviously motorcycles are a riskier route, but what users like /u/fartgoblin420 don't mention is a huge amount of risk is shouldered by those who ride in a dangerous manner without the right gear and those who choose not to ride sober.   Another big misconception is that LA drivers are the WORST. People here love to complain about this but the reality is that we have a similar number of accidents compared to a lot of major cities.

Wear proper gear from head to toe. Risk is not some immutable ocean of dangers that you're forced to float in without agency.     I just didn't feel the need to check, because there's no need to.   This is a problematic mentality and lends zero credence to your argument.

That said b/w the 2500 rebate, lower insurance, no gas, right to use HOV at all times, and the fact that ppl congratulate you for doing nothing, an EV lease was my pref and roughly costs $5000 for 3 years."

They're new-ish to the market though so I think they're out of your price range, so my main advice is go as small as possible, with a hatch back for transporting some home goods for your apartment."

LosAngeles,3dta34,pcar773,16,Tue Jul 21 00:49:02 2015 UTC,I can't imagine the tow trucks were in that much danger.  Were they towing in the middle of the blaze?  Or once the fire fighters had it under control?
LosAngeles,3dta34,welostmagic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:13:14 2015 UTC,"The owners of those cars didn't have a say in the matter. They're getting slammed with a $2000+ charge for a service they never requested because a towing company decided to take advantage of an emergency situation to make a profit. If they're going to send a bill to someone for towing services in the middle of a wildfire, they SHOULD be sending it to CHP, who called them in, not to the owners of the cars who were told to evacuate."

LosAngeles,3dta34,jonovan,-15,Sun Jul 19 19:30:24 2015 UTC,"Who should pay for it, then? Someone has too. If you get injured in a freak accident, you still have to pay the medical bills, even if the injury was no fault of your own. That's life."
LosAngeles,3dta34,freethegeek,21,Sun Jul 19 10:49:43 2015 UTC,The area was secure and safe when the tow trucks came in. A fair price for a tow is around a hundred dollars. Storage fees are about seventy five per day. The tow companies charging anything more than a couple hundred dollars per car is price gouging.
LosAngeles,3dta34,Loch-Ness-Munster,-4,Sun Jul 19 15:04:26 2015 UTC,"What?  A-1, who was AAA certified and the police called for me, towed my car from the 118 to a storage, 1.6 miles away and kept it until the next morning.

LosAngeles,3dta34,wilkenm,10,Sun Jul 19 17:28:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, you got (legally) screwed.  The first tip off is the ""A-1"" name, a carry over from when appearing first in the phone book mattered."
LosAngeles,3dta34,voyetra8,4,Sun Jul 19 18:03:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with what you are saying, however, the citizens apparently didn't call the tow companies... CHP did.    So, it's likely the citizens didn't enter into a contract with the tow company, and I imagine aren't legally liable for the charges. However, these people need cars to live their lives, and will probably have to pay to get them out of the tow lots in a timely manner."
LosAngeles,3dta34,wilkenm,2,Sun Jul 19 17:00:49 2015 UTC,The CHP is allowed to have cars towed from a highway.
LosAngeles,3dta34,voyetra8,7,Sun Jul 19 18:00:49 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I am not sure they are allowed to have private companies do the towing with no controls in place over the charged rate.    Edit: Here you go. (PDF warning.) See Item 1B:   ""Within each tow district, the Area Commander shall determine [...] reasonable rates [...]""    Based on the article, it says the tow companies charged their ""standard"" hourly rates, so... bureaucracy in action!"

Regardless, growing up in south central I am aware that the two segments of the population are allies more than anything. We see that we are at the bottom of the social totem pole and I hope we strive to push for change together.

LosAngeles,3dtin7,SiirusBladestalker,6,Mon Jul 20 00:44:17 2015 UTC,"For the most part Latino, Asian, and White people know that there are horrible people within their ethnicity and when the criminals don't obey the law, become hostile and fight police officers there is a good chance they can get shot and killed. They accept the reality of the world that sometimes crappy things happen to criminals (even if the criminal is of their ethnicity). That's why when a Latino, Asian or white person is killed by police there aren't large scale protests and riots. On the other hand other ethnicity wants to play the race card even when shootings or use of force is found to be completely appropriate. They don't want to focus on their community so playing the race card allows them to place blame elsewhere.  Edit: Posted the same thing in r/racism and got banned for it.  No wonder there is no traffic there.  For a sub-reddit that is suppose to speak up for people of color they sure seem to want to shut down the voice of reason ."
LosAngeles,3dtin7,Roofio24,-4,Mon Jul 20 01:33:52 2015 UTC,"If you want people to take you seriously don't generalize millions of people and use a buzzword associated with dumb racists.

On the other hand other ethnicity wants to play the race card even when shootings or use of force is found to be completely appropriate. They don't want to focus on their community so playing the race card allows them to place blame elsewhere.   How is this not just the most tired of stereotypes? I grew up in a poor Hispanic and Black neighborhood - the amount of black people who I know that actually bitch and moan about whitey are miniscule. Most just live their lives. The amount that would riot and loot stores is even smaller than that. Also lmfao at that cowardly attempt at avoiding looking like a racist with that list of races and saying ""other ethnicity.""

LosAngeles,3dtin7,BoxerHits,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:05:26 2015 UTC,"White dude here. I think the death of anyone at the hands of cops is bullshit unless that person was actually threatening the physical well being of the cop. Unfortunately we now live in a world where the cops can use the South Park ""It's coming right for us!"" argument and shoot and kill anyone who they think is remotely threatening. It happened in Los Feliz recently and it happens all over LA. Historically it's been a race issue, and I think we're at a tipping point now where it's an ""everyone is a criminal until proven not"" scenario for the LAPD.   I'm not going to in any way dispute some of the points made by the article (Latinos may look at cops more favorably because ""it was worse where I came from"" or because the Catholic Church doesn't help like the Black Church's do with spreading the grass roots efforts - perhaps the new Pope will help change that), but I will say this: cops all over the USA have carte blanche to fuck you up, break your shit, and kill you because they ""felt threatened"" or you didn't do what the fuck they wanted you to do.   Join the good fight. Download the Mobile Justice app and keep it on your phone. Use it to record the police. It will automatically upload to the ACLU's servers. Fight back against the unchecked authority of cops against citizens who don't deserve to be assaulted or deprived of their rights.  Even if someone breaks the law they still have rights. Cops are not judge, jury, and executioner."

In ten years it will probably be a highly sought after area, just like Echo Park's transformation.  South Central (Watts, Florence-Graham, Jefferson Park- most blocks south of MLK and north of the 105) are still hood. Crenshaw is expected to get gentrification once the Crenshaw line is complete, but that's further in the future.  Long Beach has parts that still haven't gotten better since the riots.  Huntington Park is probably my favorite area that somehow hasn't been gentrified, likely because it's really isn't near anything, but holy shit that city has everything you need for a hipster colony.

Pretty much every neighborhood in the City of L.A. has seen home prices recover since the 2008 real estate crash. Even skid row values are booming. (I'd guess the reason there hasn't been much of a clean-up there yet is that there are a lot of redevelopment plans in place, and they don't want the yuppies moving in en masse and complaining about construction noise.)  For neighborhoods to really go downhill, there has to be a lack of demand, but when people want to live in L.A., that keeps the demand and prices up. When a completely generic home like this in Compton is selling for more than double the average American home price, you don't have to worry about degentrification."

LosAngeles,3dvnk8,havestronaut,6,Mon Jul 20 00:32:13 2015 UTC,Umami is overpriced trash
LosAngeles,3dvnk8,keepitonehundred,2,Sun Jul 19 22:53:24 2015 UTC,"I'm a burger lover. I have my personal preferences, and I can slum it with a Del Taco burger (about as low as I'll venture), move up to a Big Mac (as much as people shit on McDonald's, I do enjoy a Big Mac, but prefer the original found at Bob's Big Boy), and my pinnacle ends at my beloved In 'n Out.  I won't be as harsh as you, but I tried Umami twice. I gave it the old college try. I was hoping for something tasty, fun, and worth the coin. I'm the kind of guy who can love Taco Bell for lunch and then enjoy some sushi for dinner (I have eclectic taste buds, what can I say). My first visit I discussed my preferences taste-wise (I'm not a huge mushroom fan per se) and went with the truffle burger and tempura onion rings. Not impressed. The burger was greasy (which I would normally like) but the bun fell apart from the grease (which I don't like). The onion rings were fine but the fancy ranch was not good and annoying because I just wanted regular ranch (which they didn't have). Onion rings are perfect for absorbing ranch dressing. This is a fact for food.  So I wasn't impressed (especially when the bill came, almost $20 after tax and tip! I can get 3 #1's from In 'n Out for that!!). But hey, I love burgers, and maybe I just didn't order the right thing. It's a big menu. So I tried again a month later. Mind you, this is hard for me, because the Umami in Burbank is across from Bob's Big Boy. A place I've loved literally since I was a ""big boy"" of about 4 or 5 years old. But I'm also a chubby guy who loves burgers, and I'm always excited for something new (ok I'm a man child). I wanted the full ""umami"" experience so I went with the Manly burger. Bacon, cheese, onion strings, how can you go wrong? Well it was wrong. I also ordered the truffle tots (which it appears they no longer even have). I'm a tater tot fan (though they rarely end up in my cargo pocket) but the tots weren't good. The burger was so salty, and the tots weren't great. As I had been burned by the ranch dressing before, I tried their own ketchup. Didn't make the tots better. I rarely leave burger and a side on my plate without taking it home for leftovers. This time I did.  Perhaps I need an Umami sherpa to guide me, but if I'm gonna spend $20 bucks on a burger meal, I'll get 3 #1's from In 'n Out and feed me and 2 friends.   Hipsters and foodies are going to shit on me, but Umami is a no go for me. I'd rather save $12 and go to Del Taco. Seriously, at least I know I'll want to finish my meal."
LosAngeles,3dvnk8,EngineerinLA,3,Mon Jul 20 02:56:59 2015 UTC,"Aw man. I'm not discounting your experience not taste buds, but I love the Manly Burger (I'm a woman. It does make me feel awkward ordering it. But I'm awkward anyways). I'm bummed that you don't like it!"

LosAngeles,3dvnk8,nancyaw,4,Mon Jul 20 06:45:50 2015 UTC,"So glad they included In 'n Out. The ingredients are fresh, the employees well trained, well paid, and the customers are always legion. I know it's ""fast food"" and it has many locations (but no franchises, all are owned by the same family), but it is definitely a fantastic burger. They don't hide their kitchen, you can watch the burgers being grilled and the potatoes being cut into fries (some of the employees can really crank them out on that hand press cutter), and they will make for you whatever you want if they have the ingredients on site.  I'm no snob, but I get seriously pissed when out of owners (especially Texans, they act like they are born with beef knowledge) claim their hometown burger joint (Whataburger, etc.) is so much better than In 'n Out because they have onion rings, add bacon, and basically make it out to be an ingredient war. Give me your basic burger up against any other chain, and it's not even a competition. I've traveled and sampled the fare. A #1 Animal Style will always make me smile."

LosAngeles,3dqshy,domestipithecus,17,Sat Jul 18 17:25:27 2015 UTC,I was hiking in Griffith across from the Greek theatre and watched this storm roll in from the pacific. We watched it go across the westside then engulf downtown. Huge lightning strikes everywhere in between. We thought it was going to keep heading east but it circled back up silver lake and Los feliz heading right towards us. We were at the highest point of the hike when I saw a huge bolt strike a palm tree less than a mile away. I was legitimately scared for all our well beings at that point because there was nowhere to go. Luckily it turned towards Pasadena and continued out that way. Definitely a crazy adrenaline rush.
LosAngeles,3dqshy,dragoness_leclerq,5,Sat Jul 18 17:50:41 2015 UTC,"We were hiking up on the PCT via Cougar Crest above Big Bear. Never hiked/jogged down a mountain so fast in my life. Sweet baby jesus we were terrified. It got so close the lightening was nearly blinding and the thunder happened like 1.5-2 seconds after. We stopped in a grouping of trees for a little while, but really wanted to get off the crest. So we jogged in between lightening sightings. Not the brightest idea, but we're alive and had lots of beer when we got home."

LosAngeles,3drmuw,first_five-eighth,0,Sun Jul 19 01:01:11 2015 UTC,You usually more than make up for it with the mortgage interest deduction.   But it certainly played a factor when I was shopping for my first condo.
LosAngeles,3drmuw,midwescoast,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"At a 40% marginal tax rate and assuming that 75% of your mortgage payment is interest, your deduction is worth about 30% of your mortgage payment. That's pretty comparable to the condo fees I've seen in LA and elsewhere  And that comes with two huge caveats. One is that you haven't already included the deduction in your buy v. rent calculation. And the other is that the value of the deduction will go down over time (as more of your payment goes toward principal), whereas the condo fee will go up over time."

LosAngeles,3drmuw,doblinitus,4,Sat Jul 18 23:08:05 2015 UTC,"The infographic was made by a realtor, so most likely it is a bit fudged. They want to get people who are maybe just on the verge of being able to afford something, and aren't necessarily in this to reflect the actual reality of what is financially responsible.  I mean shit I make ~$40K, will probably be in the $60K range on my next promotion, but still cannot at all envision myself buying a place."
LosAngeles,3drmuw,aiko74,7,Sat Jul 18 23:28:42 2015 UTC,"I'd be remiss if I didn't address your generalizations about me simply based on my job.   Hi! I'm John. I live in Hollywood with my boyfriend of 9 years and my cute dog Cuthbert, the three of us are a bunch of homebodies. I've been in real estate for a little over 3 years now. Before getting involved in real estate I worked in politics and government for 10 years. I took a break from college to intern on a presidential campaign in Iowa. 2 weeks into the internship I was offered a job and that pretty much opened up a lot of work opportunities for me in the future. I always loved working in politics because I truly believe in the power of people to affect change in their lives. Once I started working for elected officials I was really able to cut through red tape for people and I was addicted to helping people. When it came time for me to change careers I decided on real estate because of a family connection to the industry and because I saw it as an area where there are a lot of bad actors that make everyone else look bad. Real estate is typically the largest expense anyone will ever make and it's a huge life decision. I take my responsibilities as a real estate agent seriously and I am passionate about helping people understand, feel informed and fully comfortable. The only way I can stay in business is by making people happy and successful so they keep coming back and referring their friends and family my way.   Not all real estate agents are shit heads. Visit my hood sometime and we can walk my dog together! Or join me at the Hollywood ArcLight or Canters Deli, you can find me both places on most Thursday and Friday nights, respectively.   <3"
LosAngeles,3drmuw,aaron91325,9,Sun Jul 19 02:03:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're a shithead. I just know that infographics are made to sell people on ideas. Realtors want to sell houses. Therefore real estate infographics tend to sell people on the idea of buying a house.   I'm sure you're a good and passionate person, and someday when I can actually afford to buy I will be on the lookout for a good realtor like you.  In the meantime, I maintain that $57K is probably not enough to comfortably afford a quarter million dollar home. Especially since I don't know a single person bringing in that income who owns rather than rents."
LosAngeles,3drmuw,aaron91325,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:13:47 2015 UTC,Just cause you can qualify for a mortgage doesn't mean you should take said mortgage. So yes the information is accurate.

For someone making $57k a year, assuming they have a 10% downpayment saved up they could afford a small condo at $288,000 also assuming 4% interest (which is a conservative assumption). Now finding a condo you like in that price range is another issue...  Edit: The figure also assumes a person with zero debt.

No one should misconstrue this infographic to be financial advice or a 100% accurate representation of what a specific individual can afford. This is meant to present some basic information in a clear and easily understandable way."

Add in HOA fees, you'd be paying at the very least 42% of your gross monthly income. Net, you're looking at far more than half of your income going towards housing. I'm no personal finance expert, but that sort of monthly obligation is putting you on very shaky ground."

LosAngeles,3dwmix,jonny360,3,Mon Jul 20 03:37:12 2015 UTC,"I use to work for the USPS. All I can tell you is, definitely get a camera cause most likely people are stealing your stuff.  Also, i knew a couple drivers that will mark your packages delivered before even delivering them so that they don't have to waste time scanning them at your door But they still have to deliver them. Also depending on the post office rules like every driver has to deliver every package when its on that route that same day. Even if they came back to the office with that package, they would have to scan it as undelivered and it will just go out the next day. Or he's putting it in the outgoing mail and thats why its taking a month for it to be delivered to your house.  I've scrolled down on here and somebody already recommended getting the signature, which that really does help because USPS drivers have to get that signature.   If you have a new guy, like a cca , most likely he's leaving it in the front desk so he doesn't have to go up to your door or he' just forgets about it and brings it back and then dumps it in the outgoing mail. I would just recommend to leave a note at your door that says knock on my door if you are delivering between the hours of so and so if not deliver to next door neighbor. Definitely talk to the post-master or the supervisor for the day you didn't receive your stuff. They have on record who delivered that day and will grill them regarding the package, most likely he'll be fired if he's a CCA.  But definitely attempt to get to know your postal workers, he'll watch out for your package when it has to be delivered. Cold water in your mailbox is a start, if he has a walking route.  Cause at this point he's probably like, ""why the fuck does this guy has so much shit being delivered. does he not know i have to deliver other peoples shit too and deliver mail within 5 hours!!!""  <--- most likely this is why he is putting your stuff in the outgoing mail afterwards. I think this is why its taking you a month to get your stuff. I just wanna go on the record that for three months at the postal office I worked almost 10 hours everyday so each and everyone of you can have your amazon packages and mail that same day. Eventually i got better and it only took me 6 hours. Some of them are good and they do their best to deliver your packages that same day. Sorry eventually I got to venting too."
LosAngeles,3dwmix,snackattackpudding,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:01:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight. I'll try contacting the post office. I contacted them the first time though and they were very unhelpful. I kept getting ""you have to talk to the manager/postmaster whatever, he'll call you back"" I ended up speaking to 3 different people and always being told i'd get a call back. Eventually I called a national number and was told that basically there is nothing for them to do once its marked delivered. But i'll try again."
LosAngeles,3dwmix,snackattackpudding,2,Mon Jul 20 07:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yea and that's what sucks. Even if you stopped the courier and asked for the supervisors number, they won't give it to you. But always try to get signature confirmation on everything and or tracking. If you have a screen door, open your door when your expecting your package but put your dog in the backyard or away from the door. You'll hear him come by and deliver your package."

LosAngeles,3dwmix,jitatime,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:39:21 2015 UTC,Someone recommended a camera. I think I might look into that. If nothing else it will tell me if its a thief or just not getting delivered.

Recently i started having packages be undeliverable yet i still get bills, go figure. Only advice i have for you is to place a camera out side your door or facing the mail box.  Some carriers will be jerks and leave it on top of your mailbox regardless of access to it.  Also you should probably just consider a PO box somewhere."
LosAngeles,3dwmix,morningmsmagpie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:54:21 2015 UTC,Camera isn't a bad idea. That would let us know if someone was stealing. I actually have a wireless webcam with auto record that might work for this. Thanks for the idea.
LosAngeles,3dwmix,morningmsmagpie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:09:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, getting a PO box is a great idea. We have a similar layout at our building, and because I also work at home, I rent a mailbox for work deliveries.

Turned out that a driver had smashed my package and shattered two bottles of balsamic vinegar sent from my mother (and packaged incredibly well.) It made a huge mess, and when they finally looked into it I ended up getting a garbage bag delivered with my soggy, destroyed package inside.  Not suggesting all of yours met the same fate, but I'd wager that my driver marked it as ""delivered"" to try to get out of taking the claim for putting a fragile package under heavy shit. Wouldn't put it past them to make a habit of marking stuff delivered and never actually doing it.  I'd consider just always requiring a signature if you're home as often as you say."
LosAngeles,3dwmix,TNinLosAngeles,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:18:34 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I suspect and getting a signature was also our idea but there isn't always an option for that when selecting shipping. I forgot to mention I used to have the best UPSP mailman in the world. He was always at my place by noon. Knew my name when he saw me walking the dogs. Great guy. Well we got a new guy right around the time packages started being ""delivered"" but not delivered. I think requiring a signature when possible and getting a camera is the best move at this point. That way I can eliminate a thief if nothing else."

As a seller myself, I'd advise you to contact your seller and notify them that you did not receive your package despite it showing up as ""delivered"" in the tracking and ask for them (or you could do it yourself) to also file a mail theft claim on the USPS website (Top bar, Help > File a claim) and report it to the local police if the seller requests for these documents so they can (maybe, depending on the seller.) file insurance claim for your packages to refund you / reship."
LosAngeles,3dwmix,MacArthurParker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:13:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion. Yes it does suck a lot. Sellers have not been very helpful. Generally they offer a small discount like 5% off our next order. Or they don't respond at all. I've filed a paypal claim on my latest missing order well see if paypal is at all helpful. I've been looking at security cameras tonight. I think that would be helpful to at least confirm if the package was delivered or if there was a theft. Its difficult to figure out how to mount a camera on the front of my rented apartment though.
LosAngeles,3dwmix,EngineerinLA,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:33:34 2015 UTC,"That is terrible customer service on their part. Paypal I know won't side with you because tracking shows up as delivered... however, with proper documentation (like police report and mail claim), they might. It would be best to call paypal and speak with someone to see what they can do provided that you are able to submit these documents to them to prove you really did not receive your order."

LosAngeles,3duf7q,Wazer87,2,Sun Jul 19 17:38:47 2015 UTC,"is that wireless or networked?  I get around 30 as well for wifi, but near 80 for networked.  Do you have a dual modem from them (5GHZ choice and 2.6)?"
LosAngeles,3duf7q,gnapster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:44:58 2015 UTC,You're welcome.
LosAngeles,3duf7q,gnapster,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:47:54 2015 UTC,Ethernet is always going to be faster. Don't feel dumb. Might be time to upgrade your hardware if you want faster than 30mbit wifi. 5ghz usually has less interference with neighbors and microwaves but doesn't go as far. Try getting any devices on your network on to wired ethernet and open up the wireless bandwidth.
LosAngeles,3duf7q,idreamincode,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:07:52 2015 UTC,I consistently get 215 mbit down and 22 up from a wired connection. My wireless connection will do about 115/20 on a 5 Ghz AC connection.  Do you have the correct modem that will get you over 50mbit? Which router are you using? It might not be able to push more than 30 mbps through.
LosAngeles,3duf7q,idreamincode,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:32 2015 UTC,"Your wireless gateway is more than fine, and actually one of our better devices offered atm.   If you're connecting onto the 2.4 band, you're really doing yourself a disservice, unless that's all that your wireless card is capable of.   Do me a favor. If you're on windows, open up command prompt (winkey+r, type cmd), then type: netsh wlan show drivers    , then copypasta the driver info and the radio info  If you're on a mac: https://networking.grok.lsu.edu/Article.aspx?articleId=17340  At the very least, you'll want a dual-band 802.11n card, but ideally you should have an 802.11ac card to utilize the best speeds across the 5Ghz band.   Just be aware of your AWG's surroundings, have realistic expectations based on speed loss over signal degradation, and do your best to use the right hardware if you want the speeds you pay for via wifi, otherwise plug it in(and have an ethernet card that supports your speeds as well)."
LosAngeles,3duf7q,twcthrowawayLA,0,Sun Jul 19 19:03:44 2015 UTC,"Looks like other people have issues with that router/modem combo.  Other people say they are only getting 30mbit via wireless on that modem. If you were to upgrade your hardware to an Arris SB6183 with a faster wireless router, I like the Asus RT-AC68u, you'll definitely be much faster.  Not a cheap solution, but you'll get way faster internets. Combos tend to be a problem."
LosAngeles,3duf7q,idreamincode,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:10:00 2015 UTC,What kind of modem do you have? Which router model? Did you upgrade from 30 to the higher speed? Sometimes you have to power cycle the modem. We paid for 15 Mb and when TWC upgraded to 50 I just had to unplug it for a minute to get the new speeds.

CAT 5e will get you up to a gig (1000mb). I swapped out my old CAT 5 cables for 5e cables and went from 80-90mb to about 260mb download on average.

Seriously, my roommate and I are pretty big power users. We got the 300 mbps package, which I even fully fucking acknowledge that we do not need. (BUT streaming MKV files to the Chromecast has absolutely never been easier, which I love. That shit was giving me a really hard time before.)  Anyway, yeah --  I think outages just happen. My Internet was down right around when you posted this, but I power cycled my router and it's been fine for the last two hours.  You're going to really dig your new, faster Internet.  ATT couldn't give me more than 12 mbps, and I was paying $65/mo.  For $75/mo, Time Warner is giving me 300 mbps. It's nuts."

This allows your pan to get hot enough to get a good sear when the steak hits the surface, whereas butter already in the pan will burn before getting hot enough. Sear both sides and remove when it's still rarer than you'd like, and tent in foil for 5 minutes on the plate."

LosAngeles,3dqus5,altonbrownfan,3,Sat Jul 18 16:02:17 2015 UTC,"Desano is super legit, it's right down the street from my buddy's place.  Amazing pizza, and I'm pretty sure they sell gelato also."
LosAngeles,3dqus5,Finglinger,3,Sat Jul 18 16:30:38 2015 UTC,"I fucking love DeSano, all things considered it's probably my favorite place in the city to get a pizza. I do find its significantly better if you eat it there, but either way never been disappointed. Also just tried Stella Barra in Hollywood and was pretty impressed."
LosAngeles,3dqus5,fingers-crossed,2,Sun Jul 19 02:40:01 2015 UTC,I feel like the only person who didn't like their pizza much
LosAngeles,3dqus5,455H013,2,Sat Jul 18 18:36:48 2015 UTC,Me neither. I prefer All Angolo's pizzas in k-town.
LosAngeles,3dqus5,a0kay,0,Sat Jul 18 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"I'll check that place out. I've been very loyal to Bravo Pizza in Hollywood for many years. Recently discovered Fresh Brothers, those are my two pizza spots at the moment"

LosAngeles,3dqus5,davidaaronstephenson,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:30:21 2015 UTC,Just curious what makes this pizza so great? Or do I have to be from new Jersey/ new York to understand
LosAngeles,3dqus5,heriman,2,Sun Jul 19 14:07:32 2015 UTC,"They have 3 wood fired pizza ovens. The place is huge and they have a lot of parking (bonus). We were there for a party and tried 6 different kinds, all good. Their dough is excellent. I wish this were the default pizza style in LA."
LosAngeles,3dqus5,Prequalified,0,Sun Jul 19 22:03:35 2015 UTC,"Larchmont pizza. Sounds like a weird place to get awesome pizza, but it's the best"
LosAngeles,3dre5s,eguy888,6,Sat Jul 18 18:52:44 2015 UTC,"But, bro, just wait till you see my super sweet aerial footage! It's such a unique perspective to see these days. I'm gonna be the next Roger Deakins!"
LosAngeles,3dre5s,voyetra8,5,Sun Jul 19 01:29:02 2015 UTC,"Officials say that ground crews had to find the drone operators and tell them to stop flying around the fire before aircraft were able to continue attempts to control the blaze. In all, the incident delayed efforts by roughly 26 minutes — valuable time as wildfires can quickly grow out of control.   I hope the officials took the controllers away from the douches and smashed it into little pieces. The cops should use the drones as target practice as well."
LosAngeles,3dre5s,Granadafan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:56:42 2015 UTC,Firefighters should utilize 2.4 GHz and 5.1 GHz jammers on helicopters and airplanes so that when they get anywhere near a drone did they will drop right out of the sky
LosAngeles,3dre5s,blackjackel,-13,Sun Jul 19 22:20:54 2015 UTC,Could you show me a report where a drone has damaged a helicopter/plane? Otherwise I'm going to assume this is like the warning to not use your cell phone near a gas station because you could blow everything up.
LosAngeles,3dre5s,jonovan,11,Sat Jul 18 23:27:03 2015 UTC,"Collision is the concern. Firefighting aircraft fly very low to the ground. A drone in the area presents a collision hazard, hence the suspended operation."
LosAngeles,3dre5s,cherokeesix,10,Sat Jul 18 23:57:04 2015 UTC,Are you kidding or just that dumb? Birds alone cause something like $400m worth of repairs to aircraft worldwide.   A low flying helicopter smacking into a drone could easily result in a crash or at the very least a very expensive repair.
LosAngeles,3dre5s,Sprinklys,-11,Sun Jul 19 00:27:19 2015 UTC,we need to start working on better helicopters
LosAngeles,3dre5s,CMDR_GnarlzDarwin,10,Sun Jul 19 00:53:38 2015 UTC,You need to understand the laws of physics.
LosAngeles,3dre5s,Kubi74,-13,Sun Jul 19 05:05:13 2015 UTC,You need to eat a dick
LosAngeles,3dre5s,CMDR_GnarlzDarwin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:41:17 2015 UTC,You should maybe learn how vulnerable aircraft can be.
LosAngeles,3dre5s,opking,0,Mon Jul 20 12:58:50 2015 UTC,I don't see how that's gonna help anyone make better helicopters
LosAngeles,3dre5s,CMDR_GnarlzDarwin,3,Mon Jul 20 21:41:37 2015 UTC,Aircraft aren't as tough as you think. Severe damage will occur if a drone smashes into an aircraft going 250 mph or gets sucked into an engine.   Even the smallest amount of damage can bring down an aircraft.
LosAngeles,3dulps,cyanpetals,4,Sun Jul 19 17:06:09 2015 UTC,what part of LA are you staying in? do you have a car? sundays are actually the best day to drive anywhere in LA because most locals just get up late and go to brunch and that's it.  And what have you already done while you were here?
LosAngeles,3dulps,wherestherain,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:14:26 2015 UTC,Watch the sunset over the ocean. Then make some joke about how its not as impressive as watching the sun rise over the ocean back home.
