TsundereSharks,3dty56,jesset77,18,Sun Jul 19 23:25:26 2015 UTC,"At first I figured that going toe to toe with a shark is a bad idea, but I guess if the shark is already going to get me, I'm probably in the water. Considering how I'm a bad swimmer (I can do the not drowning part, but God forbid you ask me to move from point A to point B in a timely manner) escape is probably futile. I suppose booping the snoot is a good last ditch effort to preserve my own life."
TsundereSharks,3dty56,Visser946,10,Sun Jul 19 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"I've heard the nose is OK, but the eyes are a better spot to aim for. Of course, if you're fighting off a shark, you probably can't think too rationally and will flail around in the general direction of the shark."
TsundereSharks,3dty56,Moonhowler22,26,Sun Jul 19 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"The snoot is the front of the sharkchan, it's probably easiest to boop.  I don't normally suggest voluntarily noticing sharkchan, but getting to the eyes means closerto the om nommers."
TsundereSharks,3dty56,ViggoMiles,2,Sun Jul 19 20:08:50 2015 UTC,"Snoot is a little close to chompers for my comfort. It's full of the Ampullae of Lorenzini, little jelly-filled vibration detecting organs, sort of like whiskers for sharks. They're for sure sensitive there. However, I'd boop the eyes or gills.   In general though? If it's big enough that it sees you fully (diving, rather than surfing or splashing at the beach) and still considers you prey, probably best to kiss your butt goodbye."

Make sure to back up your iPhone in iTunes first (on your hard drive- not in iCloud). After you're SURE everything is backed up, do a factory reset of your iPhone. Download the iOS 8.4 ipsw file from somewhere on the internet. Make sure you choose the right one according to your phone model and carrier. Apply that software update to your phone manually because jailbreaking doesn't work well if you updated your software over Wi-Fi.   Set up the phone as a new iPhone, DO NOT RESTORE FROM BACKUP YET.  Once you're at the phone's home screen, you can use TaiG to jailbreak your phone. When you're done, restore the phone from the backup you made in iTunes. Voila! You're done. Now go to /r/jailbreaking for all the latest and greatest tweaks for your phone."

This shark is a major drama queen who has beached herself because senpai never noticed her, and the weight of her heart has anchored her to shore. With the help of her friends and a sturdy tow rope, she gets back out there to find some other fish in the sea. Maybe a new senpai will notice her."

Looking at the edge of said boat there you get an idea of it being made of wood or construction foam.  Next look at the blanket it's all sitting on.  The water could have been frosting, but is much more believably also foam.  All in all there are too many things in contact with it that would be incredibly messy to consider it cake.  Also why would you put a baby in cake that's silly. I blame the photo (gif) quality."

Her mouth was agape as he continued rubbing her body, careful avoiding anything considered too... Private.  'S-senpai is touching me!! Senpai's hands! They feel softer and more caring than the water around us!' She though as his skilful fingers continued to dance on her skin. He rubbed the end of her nose and she was embarrassed beyond belief as her eyes rolled from the sensation.  ""Senpai... M-more...!""  Edit: corrections  EDIT 2: Yooo 100 upvotes! Thanks everyone!"

It reminded me of the famous copypasta...   I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it's a peach of cake."

Myth of article  Toyotama-hime:       Toyotama first met the hunter-turned-fisherman Hoori (a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu) when he was trying to find his brother's lost fishing hook beneath the waves. It is here he encountered Toyotama who sought her father's permission to assist him on his task. Shortly afterwards, the two both fell in love and soon enough the two got married and spent years together under the ocean. Eventually Hoori began to yearn for the surface world Toyotama who was pregnant with their child, agreed to settle in her husband's native environment for the time being. Late in Toyotama's pregnancy, Hoori built a hut for their family to live in by the sea and it was here that Toyotama requested her husband not watch while she gave birth to their child. Hoori waited patiently while his wife was in labour until Toyotama gave birth to a son named Ugayafukiaezu. Unfortunately, Hoori's curiosity got the better of him and he attempted to spy on his wife. To his surprise however, rather than seeing his wife as he knew her, he witnessed an enormous wani cradling his child. This creature was none other than his beloved Toyotama who had shape-shifted to give birth. After catching her husband spying on her, she was utterly ashamed that her husband broke his promise. Unable to forgive Hoori, she abandoned both him and their child by returning to the sea. Following her departure, she sent her younger sister, Tamayori to help raise the child, in her absence. As Ugayafukiaezu grew of age, he married his aunt Tamayori and their child became the first Emperor of Japan, Jimmu.

TsundereSharks,3ajb8d,Grim_Squirrel,5,Sun Jun 21 15:35:06 2015 UTC,"It's all about reproduction. This involves the transfer of DNA, which needs to be self replicating.   Viruses come into question because they only use RNA to replicate.  A theory in science is that spontaneous chemical evolution had to happen at least once.    DNA is very stable, however RNA is unstable, but is used to synthesize new DNA.  This brings light to another theory, that DNA eventually evolved from a self replicating RNA strand.   Life is about anabolism, catabolism, and reproduction. If it does not meet these things, it is far from considered a life form, unless proven otherwise"

So don't fuck with them.  Unless you're senpai."

Anyways, a couple of people have messaged me asking if I would post this on the subreddit and not just on the tumblr so I thought I might as well make a post about it.  I’m afraid this is the last one I’ll be posting here directly and from now on I’m going to be making updates on just ellorytheshark.tumblr.com  I love how quickly everybody here has embraced this comic. Honestly, this is the most positively-received thing I’ve made. But I’ve been thinking about the stories I want to tell and the character arc I have in mind and I don’t want to end up being the guy a few months from now who plugs his marginally-related shark comic and wears out his welcome.  But if somebody wants to make this comic its own sub, feel free.  If you want to post the comics from the tumblr onto here yourself, go nuts.  I’ll still love all of you either way.  …and th-thank you for finally noticing me (๑•_•๑)  EDIT: Eh, screw it, I made a subreddit, too: http://www.reddit.com/r/ellory .

It can be brought about in certain sharks by inverting them or grasping their snout.  One theory is that the response prevents injury to female sharks during mating.  Researchers make use of the response to temporarily pacify sharks while they are being handled for study.

TsundereSharks,36s2ig,HipsOfAViolin,19,Thu May 21 20:09:14 2015 UTC,I think you mean Hiragana. Romaji is when you write Japanese words using roman characters. There is literally no Romanji in that picture.

The う cause arigatō is a long sound.  Keep at it, kana was really fun to learn for me, picked it up in like a week :) I'm learning kanji with Anki right now, also helps with my Cantonese (I'm a canto heritage learner)"
TsundereSharks,36s2ig,RampantLight,0,Thu May 21 23:12:41 2015 UTC,Commas kinda don't exist in Japanese either. It's a beautifully simplistic language in that there's so little punctuation necessary.
TsundereSharks,36s2ig,thenickdude,3,Fri May 22 04:23:34 2015 UTC,"Uh, yeah they do."
TsundereSharks,36s2ig,pm-me-uranus,3,Fri May 22 08:37:41 2015 UTC,Take the Japanese Wikipedia's article on Japan as an example:  http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC  Look at all those 、in the first sentence alone!
TsundereSharks,36s2ig,Andarnio,0,Fri May 22 10:38:56 2015 UTC,But they aren't actually necessary. Traditional Japanese writing doesn't include commas.

TsundereSharks,36ajs3,derefr,11,Mon May 18 02:43:48 2015 UTC,I think mostly because your comics aren't depicting tsundere sharks; they're depicting moe sharks.

This means that when you post a comment, it shows up in our mod queue and we can approve it to make it visible to others, but otherwise nobody can see anything that you post.  This normally has to do with accidentally breaking one of the main Rules of Reddit.  The best course of action to resolve an issue like this one is to contact the Reddit Admins and try to find out how you may have displeased them, and see what you can do to make things right again.  Best of luck. :3"

Be aware that Admins are pretty good at spotting throwaway accounts, and ban evasion is just as bannable an offense as anything else.  Instead I recommend things like ""communicate with them to know what's the matter"" and ""endeavor to follow the rules in good faith"".  Or, alternately, just .. enjoy being kept in various bubbles forever incapable of really interacting with anybody. I guess however you prefer to roll, at the end of the day. xD"

TsundereSharks,35kl9x,Cerebralfish,6,Mon May 11 08:28:14 2015 UTC,"Basically, for the same reason that we encourage our children to dress up as (often fictional) horrific, murdering, bloodthirsty monsters, demons, spirits and beasts as a performance to solicit candy from strangers on All Hallows Eve.  It is in human nature to make light of communal fears which have been blown completely out of proportion. In the process, we can even grow to heal our communal empathy for the ""monstrous"" beast, and see through the terror of a ""monstrous"" spirit as both fictional and really, kind of goofy.  In this ""subculture"", the in-joke is to compare the dangerously unpredictable and bad for your health Shark to the dangerously unpredictable and bad for your health short temper of an emotionally immature anime character."

This normally has to do with accidentally breaking one of the main Rules of Reddit.  The best course of action to resolve an issue like this one is to contact the Reddit Admins and try to find out how you may have displeased them, and see what you can do to make things right again.

TsundereSharks,34inxc,jesset77,9,Fri May 1 21:26:53 2015 UTC,"Lol. Not to detract from the immense kawaii you've got going on already — but to really nail Tsundere, just focus on somebody who's heart has fallen in love but who's brain just can't stand the person.   Early in a narrative, they usually do not even realize their own infatuation, the only thing they really perceive is the confusion and frustration from their conflicted feelings. So, they are constantly annoyed and they look for things to blame for it. What's the perfect scapegoat? Well that moron/slob/deadbeat/showoff/pervert who always seems to wind up smack dab in the middle of their problems! It must be his fault, right? Kick his ass! xD  Later in a narrative — as they begin to realize their own feelings — they may remain a lot like this because of half-denying it, or because they are too frightened to behave honestly and just lump responsibility onto their paramour to somehow figure it out. To show them unsolicited affection.. but not too much! Not at the wrong time! Not in such a way as to be obvious in front of others! etc, etc. ;3  That's obviously not a story you have to tell in a gif. Instead, it's a story anybody who has watched at least 1 anime has seen played out a minimum of 3 times so all you've got to do is touch upon a single stereotypical reaction within that narrative arc, just like quoting a line out of futurama that everybody is guaranteed to have seen before. ;3"
TsundereSharks,34inxc,myfunnies420,3,Fri May 1 23:52:57 2015 UTC,"Whoa, thanks for the detailed reply.  After reading your reply, I guess I did capture some of the tsundere elements?   Shark-chan is initially mad and abrasive. Then she decides to oblige and perform the trick but she plays it off (denial) as it was nothing. And finally, the inner desire to be noticed. :3"

TsundereSharks,34inxc,Logan117,2,Sat May 2 03:37:51 2015 UTC,Wtf?! I thought Tsundre just meant it had cartoon eyes and said Japanese cartoon things. Why would you care to be so technical about it?
TsundereSharks,34inxc,jesset77,4,Sat May 2 12:23:37 2015 UTC,"Right, and in some parts of the US they call every kind of soda ""Coke"".  Even Pepsi. xD  Here is the TVtropes article on Tsundere.  Like Coke amongst soda, you're not going to get very far in almost any anime without tripping over this silly formula, somewhere. But that doesn't make the word Tsundere simply mean ""the way that Japanese cartoonists draw things"".  In any event, A shark just made to look cute (""Kawaii"") is nice. But a shark that gets a sympathetic personality out of it's anime trappings, and that personality can't tell if it hates or loves the viewer (and furthermore the viewer can't tell how horrifically painful either outcome would be!) is what is going to land maximal upboats. ;3"

TsundereSharks,33bdp9,JoshuMertens,2,Tue Apr 21 21:21:34 2015 UTC,Decapitated shark head mask is the next fashion trend.
TsundereSharks,33bdp9,foreveralone8,-5,Tue Apr 21 21:23:34 2015 UTC,This marks the fourth time I've come across a post from this sub from scrolling down my front page. Thank you yet again for letting me know I've wandered too far.
TsundereSharks,33bplq,Ryio5,2,Tue Apr 21 05:33:11 2015 UTC,That is definitely a gold crown zam-chan.
TsundereSharks,33bplq,Crjbsgwuehryj,2,Wed Apr 22 05:29:15 2015 UTC,What game is this?
TsundereSharks,33bplq,blacmombaa,2,Wed Apr 22 17:21:49 2015 UTC,Monster Hunter 4(U?). can't tell if it's the western or jap version
TsundereSharks,33bplq,pandaamongstmen,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:40:24 2015 UTC,Japanese version of MH4 or 4U.  I'm guessing 4U.  There is a Western version too.
TsundereSharks,33bplq,KairuGuddoIn,1 point,Thu Apr 23 17:01:47 2015 UTC,Late response but it's 4. There was an event in the summer that had a giant Zamtrios. It's ridiculous while inflated.  http://youtu.be/7qeLXkw21pE
TsundereSharks,338awq,InfinityLDog,80,Mon Apr 20 13:17:41 2015 UTC,That shark looks genuinely confused/disturbed.
TsundereSharks,338awq,EmoRabit,57,Mon Apr 20 13:33:36 2015 UTC,The sensory organs in its nose are pretty sensitive. Just doing this and turning a shark upside down can cause them to go into a trance and shit. It's creepy
TsundereSharks,338awq,PacoPenguin,20,Mon Apr 20 14:55:36 2015 UTC,and shit   can't tell whether or not that's a verb

TsundereSharks,338awq,PacoPenguin,55,Mon Apr 20 16:41:28 2015 UTC,"""Some scientists believe that tonic immobility displayed by sharks may facilitate mating, and consistent with this interpretation is the observation that female sharks seem more susceptible to tonic immobility than males.""  So basically, scuba-kun is (intentionally or not) literally putting the moves on shark-chan to which shark-chan is in fact anticipating some action."
TsundereSharks,338awq,Diodon,21,Mon Apr 20 17:45:45 2015 UTC,"Shark-chica, wowwow!"

TsundereSharks,338awq,Nichdel,26,Mon Apr 20 16:48:48 2015 UTC,I don't think we even need to edit this one to make it kawaii
TsundereSharks,338awq,RedDeadRevengeance,14,Mon Apr 20 18:44:33 2015 UTC,It looks like somebody gave this a go two months back. :3  Plus a couple of other contenders

TsundereSharks,338awq,DrShocker,11,Mon Apr 20 18:00:21 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned in the other thread, it depends on the type of shark. That's mostly true for larger shark species."

TsundereSharks,332lxq,SerCiddy,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:34:28 2015 UTC,"uh... I have a scenario in mind.  A visual novel - type game that focuses on the delicate balance between a marine biologist's fear of sharks and his delusions of tsundere sharks. To make it worse, he's hired at an aquarium to diagnose the pandemic the sharks are facing in their environments. Depending on his choices and actions, either the sharks become more realistic or tsunderistic to him. Possible endings could be, a) he lets them die because the fear of them turns to hatred and he let's them die.(skewed hate of shark in the spectrum) b) he ends up saving them by finding the cure but is only professional about them.(neutral ending) c) as an extension of the neutral ending, achieved by tsundere points (skewed love of sharks), he can no longer see them as just sharks, gets lost in his delusions and comes to be one with them. In his delusions he gets along with them, playing through a montage of life moments with the tsundere sharks. In reality he jumps into the shark tank and gets nobbed to bits, the ending having the water turn blood red. Also the aquarium's insurance isn't going to cover that. And it starts a controversy accross legal boards over the issue of shark domestication."

TsundereSharks,31ur8e,redsomething,3,Wed Apr 8 08:52:33 2015 UTC,It slightly bothers me that they take the time to draw the periodic table correctly but insist on using a really bad Mercator projection for the weather map.
TsundereSharks,31ur8e,milkisklim,3,Thu Apr 9 03:48:55 2015 UTC,Where is this from?
TsundereSharks,31ur8e,Reformingsaint,4,Wed Apr 8 23:01:24 2015 UTC,The character is Iara Dos Santos aka Shark-Girl. She's a student at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Her first appearance was in Wolverine and the X-Men #20. This picture is from Storm #10.
TsundereSharks,31ur8e,vivvav,2,Thu Apr 9 02:25:15 2015 UTC,Iara is also a member of Spider-Man's special class at the Jean Grey school in Spider-Man and the X-Men.

TsundereSharks,31pdtc,Forotosh,33,Tue Apr 7 03:57:01 2015 UTC,Do you get to put your Mii's into it or something? I could see myself getting this game just to set up awkward situations with friends and send them the results.
TsundereSharks,31pdtc,Urvilan,54,Tue Apr 7 04:18:32 2015 UTC,You do get to put your Miis in it but you can't really set them up together unless they ask you if you can set them up with someone. It's mostly all random events that happen with all the Miis that you put in the game.
TsundereSharks,31pdtc,Link1299,20,Tue Apr 7 04:20:20 2015 UTC,"But on the plus side if you've ever wanted a world where you have the potential to form friendships with Batman, your friend next door who keeps pinging your DS sensor, a rabbit man, and Hitler, this game is for you."

When we move, we give off some of these pulses from our nerves firing off.   So by rubbing his hands over the area where these organs are most dense (the sharks nose), he is sending a shit ton of signals that are being read by these organs. It puts shark into an overload mode where they just don't know what to do. Supposedly, it does feel good for the shark... it is sort of like an orgasmic feeling apparently."

TsundereSharks,30qq0k,ChildOfTwincest,3,Tue Mar 31 00:05:44 2015 UTC,"I think it would be cool if there was a shark-chan who keeps getting stuff stuck in her teeth (tires, plastic, a bowling pin) that Scuba-senpai has to remove. Whenever he does remove something, Teeth-chan  insists on treating him to dinner or a Clownfish stand-up routine or something. As Scuba-senpai progresses further through Teeth-chan's route it becomes clear that after a while she started getting stuff stuck in her teeth intentionally so she had an excuse to get his help and therefore go on a date-o (doki-doki) with Scuba-senpai.  I think this would be a great arc as it is initially just a running gag but later opens up, giving you room to explore some deeper themes (pollution of waters, eating disorders, and the need to be more honest about one's feelings) and potentially add an actual message to what is otherwise just kawaii-tsundere-shark-chan-desu. I guess maybe I've just been spoilt by Katawa Shoujo of late :P  Anyway, that's my idea for a heroine, let me know if you'd like me to try and come up with rough scenarios involving Teeth-chan.   PS: I was also kind of toying with the idea of a dolphin-chan disguised as a shark-chan so she can attend shark school (Scuba-kun would find out fairly early and a lot of scenarios would involve trying to keep her secret safe. Hilarity ensues)"

TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,Torgamous,87,Sat Mar 21 02:20:39 2015 UTC,Does it help you if you learn that sharks are shy?  If you don't appear as a threat or food to them then you can watch them hesitate in their approach of you.
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,duckmurderer,54,Sat Mar 21 04:41:44 2015 UTC,If I'm just swimming how do I not look like food or a threat? Genuine question here.
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,Xethaios,72,Sat Mar 21 05:01:28 2015 UTC,"Well, as long as you don't look like a seal or have an open wound, you aren't food. If you're fairly, relatively, still then you're rather non threatening. Not motionless, just not chasing the shark around and letting it come to you.  Edit:  Also, don't just go swimming looking around for sharks either. They're wild creatures and may bite or attack you for any reason they find appropriate. Hire a service so that if you get injured it's their fault and not your own!"
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,duckmurderer,80,Sat Mar 21 05:03:19 2015 UTC,So I should treat a shark the same way I would treat a tsundere. That is way too convenient to be true.

TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,ShallowBasketcase,26,Sat Mar 21 13:28:47 2015 UTC,Just out of curiosity what do sharks mean to you? (I'd like to know why tsundere and shark are connected)
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,sumphatguy,67,Sat Mar 21 13:47:18 2015 UTC,"The full origin was basically someone saying, ""What if sharks don't actually mean to hurt us, but they just don't know how to show affection?""  someone related that comment to the ""Tsundere"" trope in anime, someone else made a subreddit, and here we are."
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,IrrelevantLeprechaun,51,Sat Mar 21 01:04:45 2015 UTC,"Someone had a picture of a little shark and someone photoshoped cutsy stuff on it and gave it a Tsundere quote, it then became a subreddit full of this wonderful absurdity."
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,Moonhowler22,12,Sat Mar 21 01:44:55 2015 UTC,I think it was just a random idea some random person had that caught on to pair the two together

TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,Torgamous,107,Sat Mar 21 04:55:46 2015 UTC,"When American kids go to a Japanese school through an exchange program, the American students are so stoked to get to experience first hand what they consider to be a superior culture, but I bet all the Japanese students are like ""ah shit, here comes another one that doesn't know Naruto is for kids!"""

TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,Nekrag777,77,Sat Mar 21 00:45:55 2015 UTC,"Like don't get me wrong, I enjoy anime, but I watch it the same way I watch any other American live action TV show. I don't start going around calling things kawaii and calling people nee-san. Transpose that kind of behavior to any other non-American culture and it becomes apparent how silly it is.  I like this subreddit in a parodical satire kind of way, but that's it."
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,Simplerdayz,68,Sat Mar 21 02:09:15 2015 UTC,"I think this place is hysterical. But I'm like you - anime is just TV except in Japanese. Incorporating the vocabulary into your everyday speech is a bit strange. Not trying to knock on anyone who does it, because I really just don't care what anyone does, it's just a bit deeper than I ever intend to go.  But sharks with bows and blushing and sometimes skirts? Yeah, that shit is hilarious."

When you're watching/reading/playing a lot of content in any foreign language you'll start to associate words with concepts and you'll use them in your normal speech. For example: there's no German word for ""awkward"" so I, and a lot of my friends just started to use it. Same for French and Japanese. That's just how language develops when people can easily communicate and share content everywhere."

TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,neyev,37,Sat Mar 21 00:47:30 2015 UTC,the owners commercialized it too hard or something
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,GOOruguru,23,Sat Mar 21 01:45:42 2015 UTC,As far as I know japanese use 2ch via apps so apparently owners of 2ch decided to create their official app and filled it with ads and blocked access to the site from other popular apps.
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,PurpleWool,66,Sat Mar 21 02:50:04 2015 UTC,"Because I'm not good at English, I use machine translation.  A manager rejects certain application, and. The person who doesn't like us chooses the company which runs the business as an agency, and. I had that variously."

TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,captainjackl,29,Sat Mar 21 10:20:45 2015 UTC,Japanese to English auto translation is notoriously bad.
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,LeiningensAnts,19,Sat Mar 21 03:15:32 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, that's because translating between the two languages, even if you are fluent in both, isn't exactly easy. I think it's because their structure and perhaps other aspects of the languages make them very different from each other. Hence why translating something from say English to German would be much easier for a machine, at least for now."
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,Jimbyl,3,Sat Mar 21 05:41:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say it is hard for a person.  It is just that sentence structures aren't 1 to 1.
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,LeiningensAnts,4,Sat Mar 21 07:03:43 2015 UTC,Exactly. Translation isn't the issue. It's interpreting the meaning of the sentence. That's something that more often than not needs a human touch.
TsundereSharks,2zr4e0,buttmysteriously,21,Sat Mar 21 08:22:24 2015 UTC,Imagine Reddit suddenly is made so that all mobile apps and plugins like RES stop working. Then Reddit releases their own official app that is loaded with ads (and sometimes the ads are NSFW). That's what happened to 2ch.

The sarcasm goes completely undetected due to cultural and language-related barriers, and it makes me wonder how common this is around the world. The comment about furries really shows just how small a world it is, in that anything you consider to be abnormal in your own culture is immediately seen by people as weird, laughable, way more common than it actually is, and genuinely messed up.  People need to remember around the world that people just have different cultural expectations and while some things might seem really weird as outsiders, every country will have their ""weird"" people and hobbies... B-baka."

TsundereSharks,2w4ayf,jesset77,5,Mon Feb 16 21:30:28 2015 UTC,"That would be an amazing side effect of trundere-ing sharks! Scientists started collecting shark data in the mid eighties when there was a resurgence in shark fisheries.  From that data, it's estimated that all shark populations have, from 1986-2000, declined by 40%-89%. Comparing shark bycatch data from the 1950s to data from the 1990s indicates that oceanic whitetip shark populations in the Gulf have declined by over 99% in that time!      We must protect our shark-chans!"
TsundereSharks,2w4ayf,sumfish,2,Tue Feb 17 00:40:56 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm hoping that that's one impact. Impressing upon the next generation an alternate narrative to the ""incomprehensible, monstrous killer"" rep that they have had throughout the millenia.  Once you (badly) paste anthropomorphic qualities over them, it gets a lot easier for people to relate to their proper fishy existence, and even to get to understand that while a predator eats because that's it's lot in life that doesn't mean that it's not just a big fish that's capable of having feelings and making friends or just wanting to play it's part in the ecosystem and live a happy life.  Basically it's a jump start for our empathetic mirror neurons to kick in and start offering this critter it's benefit of the doubt and leaving it the room it needs instead of prejudicially trying to eradicate them.  It's on par with Halloween. Instead of really fearing ghosts and witches and vampires and beings that our modern society knows do not pose any actual, measurable threat to us, we play off of that fear to encourage children to dress in ""spooky"" outfits and win candy prizes for showing those off. :3"

TsundereSharks,2vkyf9,jewjitsu121,1 point,Thu Feb 12 19:54:23 2015 UTC,There are way too many articles of people getting speared by Marlins and getting maimed or killed so hopefully not often. I guess it's a risk if you're hunting/fishing an animal with a spear for a nose.

TsundereSharks,2vjpb0,MuricanPie,25,Wed Feb 11 16:11:14 2015 UTC,The Fruit of Grisaia had a female character who was nothing but tsundere. I'm sure you can find some good sound clips from her if you look.
TsundereSharks,2vjpb0,NarcissisticWaffle,10,Wed Feb 11 18:25:19 2015 UTC,"Checking it out right now!  Im guessing the character you're talking about is Michiru, and she is pretty spot on for what were looking for. Whats great is if we cant get a clean enough audio from the anime, we can see about the Visual novel (since music and sound effects can be disabled in most visual novels)."
TsundereSharks,2vjpb0,PurplePudding,5,Wed Feb 11 21:24:35 2015 UTC,I recommend going the visual novel route. It'll be much easier to separate the voices. And yes you can mute everything except Michiru in the VN.

TsundereSharks,2vjpb0,xRyanHatex,1 point,Fri Feb 13 19:28:07 2015 UTC,"Its a reference to the anime Oreshura. The main characters fantasy name is Burning Fighting Fighter and one of the girls met him in her ""past life"" where her name was Burning Pudding Princess. They are all delusional as hell.  Its just what came to mind when I saw Pudding, in a thread about Tsundere anime girls, thats why i begged for your forgiveness."

TsundereSharks,2vjpb0,SUPERKAMIGURU,1 point,Fri Feb 13 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"Think about it: her death sound would be from when she found her cat, dead.  This should severely reduce the amount of times that you'll be dying. Call it extra incentive."
TsundereSharks,2vjpb0,DrChayne,15,Sun Feb 15 05:28:02 2015 UTC,"Basically any anime with a character voiced by Kugimiya Rie will have what you're looking for. She's the tsundere archtype. Most notable tsundere character's she plays include Sanzenin Nagi from Hayate no Gotoku, Shana from Shakugan no Shana, Taiga from Tora Dora, and Louise from Zero no Tsukaima.   Another notable Tsundere character is Tohsaka Rin from the Fate/Stay Night franchise. There's also Matou Sakura from the same series who calls the main character ""Senpai"". If you want to get really clear sound clips, there's a Visual Novel associated with the franchise that you can download and grab them from the program files.   I have more tsundere characters but if you need more just ask. Otherwise we're getting into ""wall of text"" territory.   If you're looking for more diverse soundbites of ""senpai"" I would recommend finding some old school shoujo shows with yuri-undertones, there tend to be a lot of ""senpai""s being thrown around. Of course you're going to find the best where most of the action takes place at a school. Strawberry Panic is the one that immediately comes to mind, though I haven't watched in ages so it may be more -chan's than -senpais.   The classic ""uguu"" sound comes from the show Kanon and most other shows tend not to have it and if they do they're generally the type of shows that specifically target weaboos and make references to other anime or anime tropes. Lucky Star is one such anime that comes to mind but I don't immediately recall if it contains that kind of sound bite.   This should get you on the right track. Let me know if you require more."

TsundereSharks,2vjpb0,atomheartother,2,Wed Feb 11 21:22:18 2015 UTC,"It's not like I want to help you or anything, but you're so pathetic I guess I have to.  Here's a youtube clip with track 1 from this CD. It's full of great tsundere lines performed by Shizuka Ito, complete with the classic ""i-it's not like I like you or anything"" (around 4:53). No ""senpai""s sadly, but enough variations of ""baka"", ""I hate you"" and ""die"" to make up for it.  You can also see a full list of the lines with English translations here."

TsundereSharks,2vftaf,HolyRomanEmperor,42,Tue Feb 10 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"Not all sharks. Some have muscular gills which can keep water moving, such as here. You can actually see the gill slits move as the shark pumps water through them."
TsundereSharks,2vftaf,Galwa,61,Tue Feb 10 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"Some do. Not sure about this specific shark, but I have faith that the diver knows that the fuck he's doing.  Also that hand motion seems to be about the gills pumping so I think the shark is fine."

TsundereSharks,2vftaf,IamWilcox,5,Tue Feb 10 21:59:02 2015 UTC,I think sand sharks(not sure if this is one) can stay still for a few hours at a time. They can push water over their gills to get the oxygen they need to do this.

TsundereSharks,2vftaf,ebai,10,Tue Feb 10 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"Kindof.  Some sharks retract their eyeballs or cover them in a membrane (the ""eyelid"") while attacking so they don't get damaged.  This shark's probably doing it instinctively as a reaction to being touched on the nose.  Mammals blink to keep their eyes moist, and to clean off any floating junk in the air that might land on them.  Fish don't really have that problem."

TsundereSharks,2vc7rf,raziphel,12,Mon Feb 9 22:45:36 2015 UTC,"Tsundere means ""Hot and cold"", as in sometimes acting lovey and sometimes acting distant or hostile.. more often than not, they like you but they hate admitting it (often even to themselves) so they just bully you instead.  Yandere means more of a ""fatal attraction"" sort of scenario. They're always proud to admit their feelings of love for you but not too concerned if you get harmed in the process. Overly Attached Girlfriend, Misery, and a majority of stalkers fit this category. x3"

TsundereSharks,2uzh1x,autowikibot,6,Fri Feb 6 14:17:05 2015 UTC,"RIM-7 Sea Sparrow:       RIM-7 Sea Sparrow is a US ship-borne short-range anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapon system, primarily intended for defense against anti-ship missiles. The system was developed in the early 1960s from the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile as a lightweight ""point defense"" weapon that could be retrofitted to existing ships as quickly as possible, often in place of existing gun-based anti-aircraft weapons. In this incarnation it was a very simple system, guided by a manually aimed radar illuminator. Since its introduction, the Sea Sparrow has undergone significant development and now resembles the AIM-7 only in general form; it is larger, faster and includes a new seeker and a launch system suitable for vertical launch from modern warships. Fifty years after its development, the Sea Sparrow remains an important part of a layered air defense system, providing a short/medium-range component especially useful against sea-skimming missiles.

TsundereSharks,2uzh1x,rusticatedcharm,9,Fri Feb 6 14:54:04 2015 UTC,They don't hit the other missiles. They blow up in proximity and have the shrapnel hit the other missile. Some AA missiles have a destruction envelope diameter of a football field.
TsundereSharks,2uzh1x,dbx99,6,Fri Feb 6 15:43:29 2015 UTC,"These days they're so darn accurate that many times they actually do strike the target aircraft, though of course an enemy missile is a more difficult target.   Some AA missiles have a destruction envelope radius of a football field.   Beyond having a nuclear warhead I think that's a bit of a stretch, you really need to be within a couple of meters to ensure enough shrapnel density to actually down the target with a conventional fragmentation warhead."

TsundereSharks,2tle1i,DeviMon1,1 point,Mon Jan 26 04:24:38 2015 UTC,"The thing is they drop from cases that you open with keys, so you can be lucky to have one in top notch quality, or a battle-scarred one.

TsundereSharks,2tle1i,cameronabab,2,Fri Jan 30 22:30:56 2015 UTC,Real money.  There are some skins that can go for over a thousand
TsundereSharks,2tle1i,sessmaru,1 point,Fri Jan 30 22:39:18 2015 UTC,... O_O Why? On a virtual gun skin? That seems a bit outrageous.
TsundereSharks,2tle1i,cameronabab,1 point,Fri Jan 30 22:40:09 2015 UTC,"Various reasons.  The two most expensive ones are out of production and that definitely attributes. One you can still get through ludicrously expensive ways, the other had a DMCA takedown slapped onto it, meaning that no more new ones could be made.  Actually, I went onto the market just now to look up the M4A4 Howl (The DMCA'd gun).  The non Stattrak version (something that keeps a tally of your kills with the specific gun in game, and is a massive modifier for how expensive a gun is), isn't on there for it's most expensive form.  But even the cheapest iteration of the gun is $205"
TsundereSharks,2tle1i,sessmaru,1 point,Fri Jan 30 23:49:48 2015 UTC,"I've never played CS, as I said before. Are people really willing to drop that kind of cash on virtual guns? Is it one of those hardcore shooters that sponsered people play and what not? Just seems like that'd be the only reason people would be willing to drop so muvh money on in-game items."
TsundereSharks,2tle1i,cameronabab,3,Sat Jan 31 00:37:01 2015 UTC,"Yea, there's a fairly large professional scene.  I'd say the only games ahead of it are League of Legends, SC2, and it's pretty close behind Dota 2.  It's more that price because there's an thriving trading economy for the virtual skins, and because of that there's no surprise in the community when certain items go for upwards of a hundred dollars.  The most expensive skin I myself have is only 66 bucks"

TsundereSharks,2rn2jv,notevenbro,35,Wed Jan 7 19:01:09 2015 UTC,"You make a mod or skin retexure. The skin retexure would be easier and probably safer (doubt you would get VAC banned). If someone does this be sure to save a backup. When the game updates it may overwrite the custom texture.   Alternatively, find a good way to contact the devs (email,  forums, reddit, steam, etc.) And suggest they add it. The game recently ish released their 2nd game type, so I'm sure the Devs are still working on new features.  So, with that out of the way what would the desired gameplay be like in a mod or specific game type? The game itsself is an asymmetrical multiplayer shooter, so that needs to be kept in mind. In the time it has taken me to type thin on my phone I have so far: 1 sharks vs 5 divers with the divers having a slightly longer than  standard respawn rate for balance, where one diver is ""senpai"" and the shark is trying to get the senpai to notice her (by eating the senpai) so basically it's a ""protect the VIP"" game mode with some themes. The non senpai divers have to protect the senpai while the shark is trying to only target that player. Only the senpai's death counts as points. Make the victory requirement for the shark to get 3/5/some given number of points, otherwise the divers win.  Thoughts?  Sorry for any formatting, on mobile.  Edit: been debating with myself if I wanted to get this game anyways and been thinking about starting to mod/make games, so I just bought the game and remote installing. I will try to start a mod soon if I can.  Edit 2: Got confirmation from the mods that they're good with mods, and they are working on more tools for mods other than just the map editor API that they have out there."

TsundereSharks,2rn2jv,teuchito,12,Wed Jan 7 19:41:36 2015 UTC,"The shark textures for the game seem to be under:   C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Depth\DepthGame\CookedPC\Characters\Sharks   Within .upk files which I believe can be opened in the Unreal Engine which I am downloading. They can also be extracted with the Unreal Package Extractor which I found from here.  This gives you a .Texture2D file and some .material files which I am not sure how to open. I also don't know how to repackage everything. Edit: There is no repacker to go with the extractor.  I'll update if I find out more/finish installing udk.  Edit: Using UE Viewer from http://www.gildor.org/downloads (Same place as package extractor) I was able to get a few .tga files. These are for the great white shark: Images (converted to .png for imgur). There is also a material file, but I don't know how to open it.  Edit2: Added a slight annotation image to the set I linked. Still waiting for UDK to download (cpu had crashed halfway through).  Edit3: UDK is finally done installing and this is what I have so far. UDK apparently doesn't like to open .upk files created in another environment or something like that and whenever I try to import all of the files from the package extractor, I get a lot of failed to import messages. I'm going to keep trying, but I'm not sure where to go from here since I'm not an UDK expert.  Edit4: Can someone check out this form page: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1022851 It's linked from http://borderlands.wikia.com/wiki/Extracting_PC_resources (where I learned about the package extractor), but I don't have permission to view it (I think I need to have made at least 10 posts or something like that).  Edit5: There might be a way to import .upk files, but every single tutorial I have found seems to have a different file structure for udk than me."
TsundereSharks,2rn2jv,bobjrsenior,3,Wed Jan 7 22:33:28 2015 UTC,I did some research last night and apparently you can write code for the Unreal engine in Visual Studio (specifically 2005 was mentioned when I saw it) so I may try that and do some digging like you did after work.

One is a serial killa, Some seek justice on other sharks, One has a new bow which can distract senpai. Last shark gets the date ?  Guess you'd need some gender anonymity for senpai..  Like maybe he's wereshark."
TsundereSharks,2rn2jv,ViggoMiles,3,Wed Jan 7 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"So there's some interesting game mode ideas in here! Doing a retexture is a nice idea, but if you want this thing to really pop it has to have a hook that's something really unique and fun that people will play because it's a fun game mode, not just a chuckle-worthy meme transplant.  I like /u/The_dude_that_does's idea about:   ...the shark is trying to get the senpai to notice her (by eating the senpai)...   Run with that, that's good. Here's an idea: I dunno how the vanilla game works as far as equipment and abilities and weapons and attacks, but if the tsundere mode is about ""noticing"", then how about if it utilizes sight cones? If there's, say, a capture the flag mode with buried treasure or something, tsundere mode could incorporate that, too: Team senpai is trying to go about their day, finding sunken treasure. They have to capture the flag and bring it home to score. Team tsundere wants to be noticed! In order to score, they have to eat a member of team senpai while senpai is looking at them. Eating a diver from behind stops them from reaching the flag, but it doesn't score; instead you just get a ""Why won't senpai notice me?!"" message. Level design would have to create twists and turns for the divers to use to hide and try and reach the treasure while only looking at the sharks obliquely, and team size and weapon loadouts would have to be adjusted to balance the game. I'd really hope to create situations where a shark player would find themselves voluntarily avoiding eating a diver and hanging out around them hoping senpai will accidentally look at them so they can have an opportunity to score."
TsundereSharks,2rn2jv,VeryGoodKarma,2,Thu Jan 8 07:01:33 2015 UTC,"Good idea, but I feel you don't quite understand the game. I highly encourage you to look up some youtube videos of depth. Worst case scenario you get to see some youtuber in a bunch of jump scare situations.  The cone of sight isn't a bad idea except for a core mechanic of the game is when a shark attacks and eats a diver the divers camera instantly focuses on this giant shark head eating them and the diver has at most a few seconds to stab the shark to death (which isnt very effective) before fully killed. There is also a heartbeat sound played that gets louder and quicker as sharks approach. The core mechanics already involve other senses to detect people since the water is somewhat murky and vision is impaired. So each kill would be senpai noticing sharkun.  Also hate to be a mood killer but you also pretty much described the existing game modes (right now there are 2). In ""blood and gold"" 4 divers escort ""STEVE,"" a robot, and fend off 2 sharks while collecting gold to upgrade weapons and equipment. In ""Megaladon"" there is one shark who is just trying to kill divers, the divers are playing a gun game type mod where picking up gold eventually gets them the next tier of guns. Death removes the top tier of guns the divers have. If a diver kills the shark, they become the shark. So in both cases it's divers trying to collect gold and kill the sharks."

The membrane is a third eyelid that protects the shark's eyes from debris while still being transparent, a big advantage both when attacking and when being attacked.  Not all sharks have this membrane, some sharks merely roll their eyes back into their head.  Funny thing is, sharks have more than just the membrane as eyelids, but only use the membrane since the other eyelid (made for cleaning the eye) is practically useless underwater."

While 1/47 is not itself definitive, just be advised that VT is not made utterly and completely happy by this software package so proceed at your own risk.  Mebe somebody more skilled at evaluating these things than I am could try running this in a VM and confirm how it behaves, what it installs etc? :3"
TsundereSharks,2qkzmf,netnerd01,3,Sun Dec 28 18:14:57 2014 UTC,1/47 is nothing. The fact that it isn't detected by one of the big AV programs and that it's just listed as TSGeneric makes me think it's a false positive. Happens a lot; possibly just due to how the exe was put together.

Antivirus softwares come up with false-positives all the time; especially with some versions of Ren'py.  If 1/47 is really that big of an issue though, take it up with the developer and let her know. She likely had an outdated version of Ren'py that AVL didn't like. Personally, I played it to completion, it didn't ask me to install anything, my (admittedly weak) antivirus is happy with it, and I've done done scans with Roguekiller and Adw Cleaner just in case something installed in the background, and they're happy with it too."

It helps them find food hiding under the sand at the bottom of the sea.    That diver is wearing chain mail, which creates a strong electromagnetic field in the water and actually attracts sharks.  Some divers don't wear them around sharks for that reason.  Anyway, no, all sharks aren't always vicious murder machines, but they're not curious kittens, either.  This dude just happens to be wearing a literal shark magnet.  I don't remember the biology behind it, but I think there are some species of sharks that get in a really calm and almost trance-like state when you hold them vertically (has to do with the structure of their gills or something?  Maybe their circulation?) so that's probably also going on here."

TsundereSharks,2opt7j,Watafool,19,Tue Dec 9 08:00:01 2014 UTC,Nichijou. Highly recommended.
TsundereSharks,2opt7j,spicypenis,3,Tue Dec 9 08:07:29 2014 UTC,It looks like a quality anime. I had a feeling as soon as I saw the gif
TsundereSharks,2opt7j,Watafool,7,Tue Dec 9 08:10:18 2014 UTC,"It is a quality anime by the definition of animation. Frequently there's lots of movements and effects, often to the extreme to make a point. Pictures might indicate that the style is simple but it is anything but.   Voice acting, story and everything else is great aswell, but I must warn you that it can be a bit intense. I wouldn't necessarily recommend watching a lot of episodes in a row.   All in all a very good watch, but the style might not be for everyone."
TsundereSharks,2opt7j,Occi-,2,Tue Dec 9 10:34:28 2014 UTC,Wakamoto sound effects are all I need.
TsundereSharks,2opt7j,mewarmo990,0,Tue Dec 9 13:01:46 2014 UTC,Nichijou basically defines the slice of life genre.

On shrooms it was joy, excitement wonder. On Clannad it was heartache, pain, infinite sadness. I never really felt connected to Okazaki until AS and it was while I was watching what his life was becoming did I finally understand how very real this show was despite the animation style. Life is very real. It is fleeting, awesome, full of beauty and frail as fuck. Afterstory might change you but I feel it could very well be for the better."

That way those ""in the know"" have the possibility to connect to your network.

TsundereSharks,2ltt4x,ViggoMiles,2,Mon Nov 10 13:36:50 2014 UTC,I genuinely don't understand the animation.  Is it supposed to just not make any sense?  Why was she enjoying the Shark nibbling on her arm?  Why did the shark freak out and eat her?  Why was there even a shark in the first place?  Am I overthinking this?

TsundereSharks,2l6k38,Lockski,2,Mon Nov 3 20:58:40 2014 UTC,I would but I have no friends.
TsundereSharks,2l6k38,Proxystarkilla,15,Tue Nov 4 00:14:20 2014 UTC,I've  been watching Vinny from Vinesauce stream this game and it actually looks like a ton of fun even though the reason for the people and sharks fighting is kinda silly

TsundereSharks,2l6k38,Alenonimo,8,Tue Nov 4 04:23:13 2014 UTC,"Probably, but if you look at the shark closely, you'll see it's also full of scars and looks really old, to give the impression it's a scary menace of the seas."
TsundereSharks,2l6k38,Weekend_Gimp,2,Tue Nov 4 10:37:25 2014 UTC,"Well yes, but I meant real sharks not just the one on the game cover."

I had a friend from college with whom we shared a similar taste in humor, silly anime references where they just don't belong, I thought of it as our own little thing. I linked her a collection of the kawaii sharks right after I first saw it on reddit knowing that she'd love it and I was so right. She loved it enough to make one of the images in the imgur collection her Facebook profile picture. Not long after she did so, she died in a car accident along with two other people, including her girlfriend.   That profile picture of the shark will always be there since her profile will never change and as the years pass on, I get to be reminded of the little inside joke that we had between us.

TsundereSharks,2jmugq,jesset77,1 point,Sun Oct 19 16:01:19 2014 UTC,"Taiyaki:       Taiyaki (鯛焼き, , literally ""baked sea bream"" ?) is a Japanese fish-shaped cake. The most common filling is red bean paste that is made from sweetened azuki beans. Other common fillings may be custard, chocolate, cheese, or sweet potato. Some shops even sell taiyaki with okonomiyaki, gyoza filling, or a sausage inside.  Taiyaki is made using regular pancake or waffle batter. The batter is poured into a fish-shaped mold for each side. The filling is then put on one side and the mold is closed. It is then cooked on both sides until golden brown.    Image from article i     Interesting: Oyoge!

Scuba-kun was breathing heavily, clutching hard onto Nyanshark-chan's dorsal fin as they both flew through the starry night sky.]  Scuba-kun: ...what's happening? Shark-chan? Why are you wearing this pink square sandwich thing?  Nyanshark-chan: You looked like you were in trouble, senpai. Also, it's a pop-tart. *pouts*  Scuba-kun: ...why...  Nyanshark-chan: I didn't really want to, but it would have been impolite to leave you to die, senpai.   Scuba-kun: ...thank you, Shark-chan.  [Nyanshark-chan begins to blush. Another thought entered her mind.]  Nyanshark-chan: It's okay senpai.  [The rest of the trip continues in silence. The pair finally reach the shore, and Scuba-kun is dropped off safely. Before he has a chance to say goodbye, Nyanshark-chan about turns and shoots away into the sky, creating a rainbow behind her. Scuba-kun looks up and waves, confused and out of breath.

The ん in 先輩（せんぱい）(senpai) takes on the ""m"" sound because its in front of a voiced kana (p, b, z, etc.).  ""ng"" and ""n"" sound almost identical, so the only worry is ""n"" vs. ""m"".  ""senpai"" is ALWAYS romanized with an ""n"", just for clarity. Putting ""m"" into my IME gives me 背mパイ (back m pie), which somehow strikes me as wrong."

TsundereSharks,2i8utt,HumbleManatee,19,Sat Oct 4 15:14:28 2014 UTC,"Unfortunately, he might have killed it.  He did a really awful release.  If you catch a shark, don't just drag it back into the water by its tail. First off, it's a great way to get bitten - they can whip around and bite you pretty easily - and second, it's pretty damn stressful for the shark.  Ideally, don't haul them onto the beach at all, but if you must, keep them close to the surf and release them correctly.  If you get one of this size and you're with someone else, both of you grab it and pick it up.  Be wary of the head end, but if you have a good grip on it, it shouldn't be a problem.  Walk into the water head first to get some water moving through their mouth and gills.  Ever heard the thing where sharks can't breathe if they're not swimming?  It's not true for most sharks, but for most of the ones caught as sport, it is.  I know most of the people here love sharks (why else would we stick silly googly eyes on them?) so be sure to do your research before you go shark fishing.  Check with your local wildlife and fisheries regulatory office to see if they have any tips for you.  Don't be a baka, senpai!  Make sure that shark has lots of doki dokis left.  EDIT:  Forgot a few words."

Anything else?"
TsundereSharks,2gif9a,Erasio,20,Tue Sep 16 00:22:56 2014 UTC,"Keep in mind that these days 'tsundere' doesn't mean what it used to mean, and the older definition (which is the one you posted) is often referred to as 'classic tsundere' to distinguish from the current definition.    The basic difference is that a classic tsundere is essentially a character who starts out cold and warms up over time (i.e. a continuous monotonic function) whereas a current tsundere may switch back-and-forth from being cold/aggressive/violent to showing a warm/needy side (i.e. Dirichlet function).    Being very lovey-dovey and then suddenly going ""sempai baka!"" is very current tsundere. Classic tsunderes don't do that as far as I know, so the Wikipedia definition isn't actually the best."

Though it works as answer pretty much exactly as well and marks my point better than a self thought up one.   This post is fairly obsolete. There are even resources on the side of why this exists and links to examples.  The words can easily be looked up. That was my main point which stands better with a copied definition ;)

The word is derived from the terms tsun tsun (ツンツン ?), meaning to turn away in disgust, and dere dere (デレデレ ?) meaning to become 'lovey dovey'.  Originally found in Japanese bishōjo games,  the word is now part of the otaku moe phenomenon,  reaching into other media such as maid cafes,  anime, manga, novels, and even mass media.

TsundereSharks,2f852l,Odinswolf,10,Tue Sep 2 04:11:53 2014 UTC,"Err... Well. It's from an anime called Kodomo no Jikan. It actually has a pretty good underlying story with good character relationships and dealing with human emotions, but it's somewhat of a polarizing series. To put it bluntly, there is a lot of loli fanservice. There is more of it in the beginning of the series, but it gets more... intense as the series goes on.   I do recommend reading it honestly. I like the charecter dynamics, and I think it deals with a taboo subject well. but the main girl (Rin) is rather sexual (think Lolita) so if that bothers you I would steer clear."

TsundereSharks,2erbne,Achierius,122,Thu Aug 28 11:36:28 2014 UTC,My guess as to what is going on here is that someone took a video of a cat in a shark suit on a roomba and edited it to be a shark in a cat suit on a roomba.  Which is what we're seeing.  EDIT: found video source here. It's much more obvious here that this is CGI.  EDIT 2: Here is another video from the same guy. I have a feeling he is about to become very popular here.
TsundereSharks,2erbne,Phib1618,17,Tue Sep 2 04:17:14 2014 UTC,Thanks. That makes a lot more sense.

TsundereSharks,2edswh,cabothief,5,Sat Aug 23 21:55:33 2014 UTC,"To add what other's have said in case you're unaware, or others are:  -ちゃん (chan) is a suffix commonly added to names, usually girls and young children, and shows familiarity. It can also be cutesy.  -さん (san) is a general, I guess 'catch-all' suffix for names. It's commonly translated as 'Mr'/'Mrs'/'Miss'.  Uguu is just a cute noise. Here's a lot of it.  Someone else mentioned -くん (kun, pronounced 'koon'). It's basically a more male version of ちゃん."
TsundereSharks,2edswh,linksfan,15,Sun Aug 24 03:14:35 2014 UTC,"The japanese is wrong.  He writes   Watashi ha/wa same-chan![that's sa-me, not same]  Scuba-chan!!   It translates as ""I am [dear] shark!"", and ""[My dear] scuba [diver]!!""  The error is that when introducing yourself, you do not apply honorifics. It's more ridiculous than saying ""Hi, my name is Mr. duelistgamer"", and IIRC it's also wrong according to Japanese language rules.  He should have written   Watashi wa/ha [written ha, pronounced wa] same desu!  Scuba-chan!!   An informal ""da"" instead of ""desu"" would be a little weird sounding because you're removing the importance that it's your name, not just your species ""I am shark!"" vs ""I am a shark"". Omitting the ""desu"" might work, but it's still not as nice sounding as a desu for sentences like this."

TsundereSharks,2e54cp,KabanaBoy,3,Thu Aug 21 02:11:27 2014 UTC,"Good beginning effort, this would be an example of a Cartoon Character shark.  The sweet spot for our sub is that the cartoon style, including dialog and visual cliches need to be the type commonly found (and endlessly reused almost to absurdity ;3) in Japanese Animation (Anime and Manga).  And then to take it home the character needs to be acting in a foolish romantic fashion. Ideally a love/hate sort of mixture. Jealous over another character, or ashamed of feeling attracted to somebody and thus not wanting to admit it, that sort of thing.  The punchline is how this unbelievably common Japanese cartoon strategy, which strikes people as endearing and often times adorable if not frustrating or even unexpectedly violent (heroine drop-kicking her erstwhile love interest into orbit, for example) contrasts and plays against the visceral sense of dread one feels towards a vicious, popularly seen as hideously ugly, single minded maritime killing machine.  You let your guard down to ""aww how sweet, she really likes him!"" before reminded that she probably ""really likes him"" for dinner. ;3"

TsundereSharks,2dggsq,HBlight,2,Thu Aug 14 03:33:00 2014 UTC,"Tsundere:       Tsundere (ツンデレ ?, pronounced [tsɯndeɽe]) is a Japanese character development process that describes a person who is initially cold and even hostile towards another person before gradually showing their warm side over time. The word is derived from the terms tsun tsun (ツンツン ?), meaning to turn away in disgust, and dere dere (デレデレ ?) meaning to become 'lovey dovey'.  Originally found in Japanese bishōjo games,  the word is now part of the otaku moe phenomenon,  reaching into other media such as maid cafes,  anime, manga, novels, and even mass media. The term was made popular in the visual novel Kimi ga Nozomu Eien.

TsundereSharks,2bgu1z,senaya,2,Thu Jul 24 23:22:28 2014 UTC,"Gave you the value of a taco, yep. Can directly spend, yes: in contrast to reddit gold. But I didn't mean to infer it's every bit as convenient as a prepaid visa card or anything, though.  You either have to spend it at a merchant who accepts Bitcoin (the intersection of Bitcoin acceptance and Taco vending in particular is a little slim and influenced heavily by where you live) or buy a gift card to any of dozens of national restaurants (or other services, amazon gift cards are very popular) from one of many services who sell for Bitcoin (Gyft, eGifter, Giftcard Zen).. and $2.50 worth is too little for buying most gift cards all on it's own.  Or sell/trade the Bitcoin directly for dollars. In the US Coinbase is still the easiest way to do that, you hook them up to a bank account like you do with Paypal and then buy or sell Bitcoin when and however you'd like, even with amounts this small.  Even less effort is you can pay the tip forward to other people, if you read up on how Changetip works.  Bitcoin is just a fairly new thing. It's money to those who accept it, it's tokens worth money to those who don't normally work with it directly, it can be traded online is impossible to counterfeit or doublespend and doesn't rely on any single kind of company in the background. :3"

TsundereSharks,2alxrl,Threethumb,1 point,Mon Jul 14 01:25:52 2014 UTC,"Regarding 'n' in Japanese: ""Before an m, b or p, it is pronounced as [m]. It is written as m in some versions of Hepburn, but as n in Wikipedia’s modified Hepburn.""  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Japanese"
TsundereSharks,2alxrl,HviteKristsDod,4,Mon Jul 14 00:48:13 2014 UTC,"I know. I never said spelling it that way is wrong, I just don't like it. That up there anyway isn't a solid rule. You'll find that a heck of a lot of Japanese pronounce the ん sound as an ""n"" instead of an ""m"" when it comes to ""senpai"" and many other examples. To me it just looks better when we're consistent about the romanized spelling of ん and other (actual) syllables, regardless of pronounciation."
TsundereSharks,2alxrl,Threethumb,2,Mon Jul 14 06:32:19 2014 UTC,"To each their own, I guess. I am personally not so pedantically concerned when it comes to discrepancies like this, especially since there is a system whereby this is a legal romanization. If I had to pick which I prefer, then I'd agree that the romanization with 'n' looks 'better', but I have no adverse reaction either way."
TsundereSharks,2alxrl,BadLuckDood,1 point,Mon Jul 14 17:46:31 2014 UTC,"Well, I personally care a lot about looks. I don't feel right if something doesn't look right to me. A folded corner on a carpet, weird placement of an object, odd computer graphics, you name it. You could argue I should learn to not be so bothered with it, but until I do, I'll dislike ""sempai"" every day!"

TsundereSharks,2alxrl,pandafat,3,Sun Jul 13 22:43:53 2014 UTC,"I never said it was, either, it's just that I prefer romanization to be done consistently, regardless of pronounciation. If there's an ん in there, it should be written as ""n"" every time. If there's a は, it should be written has ""ha"" regardless of whether it's used as a topic marker or not. I just like it that way. I never said it's wrong, just that it makes my heart cry. Which it does."

I know my writing is not the best, this is unedited first try written with notepad. Enjoy. Tsundere sharks, script-  Part 1   WAKE UP! I groggily come to. I open my eyes and try to locate the voice that woke me.  It doesnt take long. My little sister, desu-chan, is staring at me with her big blue eyes 2 inches from my face. I recoil into the wall behind me with a thud, and books fall from the shelf above me. Well, goodmorning. Desu-chan~ You're going to be late for school oni-chan!! Hurry up! le moi~ No apology? Desu-chan~ For what? le moi~ For scaring me into the wall, what else? I am actually pretty annoyed. She could have woken me up from the hallway. Desu-chan~ Teehee, thats your fault! She rushes out of the room before I can utter a response. Whatever. I need to get ready for my first day of school.  Part 2   I walk out my front door into the bright town of tsundere-ville. Every time I go outside, I am reminded of how beautiful my coast line town is. I start to turn left and then remember... Im going to a new experimental school today. I turn on my heel and head the other direction. I wonder what my new school will look like? Will I be able to make friends? I will be completely alone. I don't have any of my old friends coming with me. I walk out of the suburbs and hit the beach. ??? I'm sure this is the right way. The woman on the phone said that I should just turn right out of my house and walk straight until I see the school, and that there would be someone waiting for me. I turn to go back, but some movement catches my eye. I turn back to the coastline, and then I see it. A Shark!! I've never seen a shark before so I run over to it. Then... It talked! Shark~Hey!! Over here! what. Shark~I SEEEEE youuu! what. Shark~Don't ignore me, Le MOI! Ah. I must be still dreaming. This whole morning has been a dream. Whatever. May as well go with the flow. I jog over to the shark. It looks about 5 feet long, and feminine.  Le moi~Uhh... hi. Yamada-san~Thanks for enrolling in shark high! I'm watashi yamada. Now that I can get a closer look, she's actually kind of... cute.  Le moi~Hey yamada-san. Yamada-san~ We're going to be late! Follow me! She swims away, and I jump in afterwards.  Part 3   I can breath underwater, so it is a dream, just as I suspected... but it still feels completely real. I swim along at a much faster speed then i'm used to, but it feels normal. Suddenly I hit something hard. Le moi~OW! what was th- Panties? Yamada-san~ YAAAAAAHHHHH!!!! B-B-BAKAAAAA!!! Le moi~ w- wai-! Chomp. My head was swiftly removed from my body by a razor sharp set of teeth.   I wake up to the sun shining through my window. I feel the warmth of the sun on my face, and smile. That was the best dream I have had in a while. Good thing it was just a dream though... the end? (fade to black)  I wrote this in like 10 min. Constructive criticism is helpful."

TsundereSharks,29pirm,JediMasterZao,65,Thu Jul 3 02:55:43 2014 UTC,T-shirts are nice but the name of the subreddit needs to go IMO. They'd be so much better with just the tsun shark meme.

TsundereSharks,29pirm,KamikazeJawa,3,Thu Jul 3 16:43:24 2014 UTC,Blue shirts were more expensive and we would have had to redo the design because how it looks on a screen is not at all how it comes out on a shirt. Though it varies with which process you use.

TsundereSharks,27kft5,Oscar_tehsharqslayer,3,Sat Jun 7 23:29:04 2014 UTC,Agreed. It was a decent season but I thought Shichimiya was kinda extra. That or I was tired of seeing the trope where a character who just jumped from the past and said surprise! I think I was watching Golden Time as well and they had a character like that as well.
TsundereSharks,27kft5,LordNero,2,Sun Jun 8 00:12:51 2014 UTC,Thank you.

The paradox is, no extraterrestrial life has made any attempts to contact us. No trace of them. In other words: where is everyone?  Now the comic makes an analogy to the ocean: you know there's lots of fish at the bottom, but they're all hiding. Why? Predators. Now if we extrapolate this concept to our galaxy...  ...and suddenly, sending out signals that are loudly looking for alien life doesn't seem that much of a good idea."

TsundereSharks,2746zt,p_iynx,16,Mon Jun 2 15:51:00 2014 UTC,"A brief history of sharkmoe (so I can link to this in the future instead of having to keep explaining myself):  Within a week of the birth of /r/tsunderesharks, and completely unrelatedly, I was drawing girls in the /r/animesketch google hangout and struggling with cute faces.   Onlookers kept giving me the advice to place the eyes further apart so that it would be cuter. Exasperated, I decided to follow that advice to its logical extreme.  The result was so hilarious I had to try it again, still hilarious (and kinda NSFW).  It got shared around some IRC chats and a few others saw my creations, reacting with a weird mixture of horror and humour. Still hilarious.   I decided it deserved at least a full page of content, so I focused that for a while, working it into my regular anatomy / figure drawing practice (it takes 5 minutes, tops, to add a shark head to a human figure that you've already drawn) and it was still hilarious.  The joke kept getting funnier every time someone new was introduced to the unexpected horror that ended each of my figure drawing sessions and eventually some of the other /r/animesketch regulars got involved. Even more hilarious.  And here we are, I've poured ruined countless hours of practice by making sure my handle is only known for the apparent sharkporn I create. Don't care. Still hilarious.  TL;DR: It's a joke that's gone on far too long. And I have no intentions of stopping.  EDIT: Yes, its actually super weird that not only are TsundereSharks and Sharkmoe 'things', they are things that spawned completely unrelated to eachother within a week. I didn't even find Tsunderesharks until a month or so ago."

TsundereSharks,2746zt,catrainbow,10,Wed Jun 4 16:56:01 2014 UTC,To be honest I feel that's because every shark is the same one and the relationship between Th shark and her Baka changes from tsun to dere.

TsundereSharks,2746zt,jnigo,15,Mon Jun 2 20:42:26 2014 UTC,"Well baka is most commonly translated as ""idiot"", so ending a post in ""...baka."" would work, as the shark would be trying to prove they don't care by insulting the subject. However, lots of posts here just spam the word."

TsundereSharks,2746zt,jnigo,6,Mon Jun 2 22:13:19 2014 UTC,"I agree. The selling point of tsunderes is the split personality of tsun and dere, the sadistic, beating senpai over with a wooden sword until he bleeds AND reluctantly bandaging him up so it won't leave a scar. Both are equally loved parts of the archetype.  But I think it would be too much to put on kawaii anime eyes on a shark chomping on senpai"

TsundereSharks,2746zt,CoolAsACucumber,8,Mon Jun 2 22:57:23 2014 UTC,"This is exactly why I was petitioning for some Street Sharks material earlier. They're just tough enough to properly convey the tsun, but slap some anime eyes and blush on there and they have just enough dere to satisfy that delicate balance of affection and malice."

TsundereSharks,2746zt,Travis-Touchdown,5,Wed Jun 4 02:26:40 2014 UTC,"Why not submit a post with your idea of a truer tsundere shark, instead of this? This kind of thing might discourage people from posting what might be funny content because now they're worried if their shark is sufficiently tsundere. Meta posts just invite drama and arguing, and once people start using them they tend to snowball and ruin subs. And I like this place...bakas."
TsundereSharks,2757vf,SerCiddy,5,Mon Jun 2 21:08:04 2014 UTC,In the way of 'hand drawn' - are digitally painted works valid? Just trying to pinpoint the hand drawn in that. I want to get in on this.

TsundereSharks,26woso,Punkmaffles,2,Sat May 31 03:36:32 2014 UTC,"yep. specifically it's a Wels from a river in spain. they got imported there to be fished and due to the warmer water/larger amount of food grew to enormous sizes.    those things are actually dangerous, they've attacked people in the past. one that size could do some serious damage if it wanted. similar sized catfish such as Piraiba and Goonch have actually swallowed people, so it'd be possible"
TsundereSharks,26woso,SovereignsUnknown,2,Sat May 31 16:08:13 2014 UTC,"I have not heard of a Goonch swallowing a whole person, a Piraiba i have though.

TsundereSharks,26woso,Punkmaffles,2,Sat May 31 20:05:14 2014 UTC,"man, Jeremy had stories of those fuckers swallowing whole cows in one of his Goonch episodes. there's also been a few recorded occurances of Goonch attacking children swimming in the river.    giant fish have been an interest of mine long before I got into river Monsters, but Jeremy is a top notch biologist and his show is a great resource of info.    but yeah, there were a series of attacks on humans between 1998 and 2007. this article is mostly about Jeremy's abnormally large fish, but does include several instances of attacks not mentioned in the show"

TsundereSharks,26btwg,SerCiddy,110,Fri May 23 21:05:35 2014 UTC,"the story behind this is actually quite interesting. Some how the Battlefield 4 community got it in their head that there was a megalodon in this level and went out to find it. The forums were all abuzz with where it could be. They ended up finding like 5+ other easter eggs including the titanic, but no megalodon. Then DICE released an update that included a megaldon."
TsundereSharks,26btwg,NDIrish27,49,Fri May 23 21:36:41 2014 UTC,"Pretty close! The original map that set off the hunt was a base map in Battlefield 4, Paracel Storm. People went crazy looking for it on that map, and eventually started looking for t-rex on rogue transmission. They found it too! Rogue transmission has the sound of a t-rex roaring, as well as shaking trees off the side of the map.   They also found a yeti sound on Golmund Railway!   The ship on Hainan Resort can be exploded as well.   Aaand as you said, DICE put the megolodon in the game after all the hype, on this level. The shark map is Nansha Strike from the Naval Strike expansion to the game. Pretty awesome!   :)"
TsundereSharks,26btwg,deathfromfront,6,Sat May 24 00:23:25 2014 UTC,thanks for enlightening me. I've never actually played battlefield but liked the story and mostly got it second/third hand from other people.

TsundereSharks,25n606,CoolAsACucumber,10,Fri May 16 19:04:05 2014 UTC,Sensei is for older teachers. Senpai usually older students.
TsundereSharks,25n606,Keksus_,5,Fri May 16 21:01:44 2014 UTC,Sensei is for teachers in general. Or people who are more experienced than you. A doctor is called sensei too.
