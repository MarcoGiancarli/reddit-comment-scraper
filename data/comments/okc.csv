It can be deadly for a puppy to be exposed to a dog park before they've completed all of their vaccinations (Parvo, I believe, is the big threat?).  Other than that, go and have fun.  Hefner's dog park is great, I'm much closer to Edmond's but generally go to Hefner because it gets far more small dog traffic (and is a bigger small dog area).  Not sure what size dog you have, though."

I'd search in these neighborhoods: Paseo, Edgemere Park, Jefferson Park, Mesta Park, Heritage Hills or the Plaza District. If you're open to having a roommate, the Deep Deuce District is a great option. Tons of young people live in that area and it's within walking distance of cool restaurants and bars.

okc,3do887,putsch80,3,Sat Jul 18 02:52:29 2015 UTC,"I very much doubt we will see Google at any time in the foreseeable future.  For starters, OKC isn't even on the list of 20+ cities that Google is focusing on. In most of those cities, Google hasn't even started laying fiber. So they've got a long ways to go before we would see any viable expansion of those services to OKC.   Also, OKC is not a very attractive market. When you have to lay fiber, a high population density is key.  The more people you can reach with fewer miles of line, the more profitable the operation will be. Due to OKC's massive sprawl, we have one of the lowest population densities of any of the top 50 metros in the country. Even the ""core"" of the city is pretty low density, with a relatively small apartment-dwelling population and most people living in single family homes.  To give an idea of popation densities, Kansas City is 1460 people/sq. mi. Austin is 2653/sq. mi. Atlanta is 3154/sq. mi. Even Provo, which has a small population overall, is 2600/sq. mi. OKC is 956/sq. mi.   Finally, in the first batches of cities, Google seemed to focus on attacking Comcast and verizon markets. I'm sure there are some cox and ATT markets in there too, but going into Cox/ATT territories didn't seem to be the thrust of their plan from what I remember."

One note: I think Ethiopian culture has a much longer/slower dinner time than Americans are used to.

After the bar there is a place on East 23rd, it's a shitty (amazing, literally catered my wedding) little food truck, they sell chicken wings. The wings are smoked, then battered and fried, and then covered in honey. It's wrong and horrible for you and delicious and I highly recommend it. Cash only.

As for Vietnamese food, if you want pho, either Pho Lien Hoa or Pho Cuong is really good. If you want more of entrees or family style meal, Golden Phoenix would be a great choice.

There is another place in Norman I am drawing a blank on the name, they get great reviews and I believe do a buffet on certain days.  Vietnamese, what are you wanting, sandwiches? Soup?  Classen area has amazing Asian style anything. The ""milk bottle"" sandwich shop shut down and the place across the street just isn't quite as good. There is a place called Cafe Bella on sw 89th and Penn, over priced but much better quality. Soup, on 23rd ""Pho Lien Hoa"" cash only, bring a twenty, bill averages 10-15, best Pho in town.  Szechuan? Grand house on classen has a great lunch special. Don't fall for the ""teriyaki beef"" trick, pick something else. If I'm not understanding what you're looking for let me know.  Did I mention I was married? See marriage changes things and one of the changes in my world was a move away from eating at places that have wheels. So disappoint, much sad tummy, very boo.

Aside from that some of the office parks have regular visits from a few, but I'm woefully unaware of current meals on wheels.

Nhinja and Tokyo Sushi are a couple of the better places, but remember that you'll be getting sushi from a land locked state."
okc,3dkyj2,beedubaya,13,Fri Jul 17 05:14:51 2015 UTC,I disagree.  There is a lot of garbage out there but there are some good Asian restaurants if you know where to go.  Tokyo Sushi is great and Nhinja is one of the worst in my opinion.

okc,3dij7q,OklaPie,5,Thu Jul 16 16:57:02 2015 UTC,We're not having the easiest time right now finding properties in our week of searching. I'm glad though your friends had success. Thanks for letting me know.
okc,3dij7q,threesifyouplease,2,Thu Jul 16 17:36:51 2015 UTC,I had a way harder time finding places to live in Norman rather than OKC.
okc,3dij7q,TeddyTenpickles,0,Thu Jul 16 21:02:33 2015 UTC,Definitely. I was pretty dead set on moving to Norman but couldn't find anything that fit what I needed and my budget at the same time :(
okc,3dij7q,highfivingmf,0,Fri Jul 17 01:35:55 2015 UTC,I wasn't trying to be rude. I apologize. I am just thinking okc is soooo big. I'm guessing you could find a place that's considerably closer than Norman.
okc,3dij7q,frazilator,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"Apologies as well. In the past hour I've found 4 properties that look great. Just that a few of the ""major"" listers have strict pet rules (declaw/outside only/30lb or under/2 pet max..) which is knocking out a slew of houses.   OR WORSE, we THINK we have a potentially good choice, only to hear that someone is closing on the lease or the application is pending. I imagine though this is just normal summer activity, as I'm sure folks are also accepting jobs in OKC or gearing up for school in the fall or whatnot.   Reminds me of when we were looking here in MS, except that the issue was that nobody believed in a fence, which was a fun adventure to find a fully fenced home (I see OKC firmly loves it fences!)    So ya know, we see all these properties in Norman and starting thinking ""well shoot...we can make a drive if we need to!"""
okc,3dij7q,threesifyouplease,2,Thu Jul 16 17:48:34 2015 UTC,Yeah it is actually kind of rare to find a non fenfenced yard around here now that I think about it. Just keep searching man. Check the different suburbs too.
okc,3dij7q,prefinished,2,Thu Jul 16 20:49:05 2015 UTC,"If you have a reference from your previous landlord about your pets being nondestructive it might help some landlords ease up on their restrictions. I was worried about them saying no with my dog, but my old landlord basically told them he's the best pet you could ask a renter to have. They had a weight limit of 50 and he's well over that.   I had decent luck driving around finding houses/duplexes in areas I liked, some landlords aren't as quick to put up internet ads as they are to put up a sign in front of the place."

okc,3dij7q,uknoikno,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:15:23 2015 UTC,It depends largely on where you are going in okc and what time you have to travel. Also location in Norman (proximity to the highway) makes a huge difference.

Going on up to 40 shouldn't be much worse and should be clear sailing to downtown.  But I'm on the outskirts; being deeper inside Norman would make it a lot worse.

okc,3dij7q,exit108,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:31:16 2015 UTC,I live in north okc closer to Edmond. There's tons of small rent houses and duplexes around here. I would suggest looking in this direction. I would imagine that it would be a much shorter drive to your job than Norman even if it is downtown. But who knows I could be wrong. Right now there is an insane amount of expansion out here. In the past year or two there have been at least 5 new apartment complexes just around my corner on rockwell and memorial and many new neighborhoods currently being built just north of here

I live in the area and it's a really nice neighborhood.  Lots of respectable people, and most of the homes are owned, not rented, so there are a lot of people that look after each other because they've known each other for years and years.  Not to mention the walk in the area is beautiful!  Lots of old, really tall trees that hang over the roads, and great lawns.  If you haven't searched out that area, give it a drive through :)"

Depends on where in Norman, but even so I have never made it in 30 minutes. Have you considered commuting to downtown OKC from any other part of OKC?   That said, the highway interchange by downtown (235/40) is not fun during morning/afternoon commutes ever.   Just saying, if there's a chance you could find something in another part of OKC, it's not worth living in Norman (which personally I prefer) if traffic is such a doozy."

There's a reason why we're chomping at the bit for the competition of all the MAPS trails. The newest addition from Overholser is nl nice and it extends your ability to ride unmolested by shitty drivers.
okc,3dftvl,k4ylr,2,Thu Jul 16 12:21:07 2015 UTC,"Ugh. I tried commuting by bicycle (and occasional bus) last year. I stuck with it for a year.  I felt horribly unsafe, the drivers are terrible. People would practically make a game of passing as close as they could. Twice somebody ran oncoming traffic OFF THE ROAD just to pass me more quickly.  I ride from Forest Park to midtown-ish. Not even that far, and a good portion is on Katy Trail."

Looks promising, but never ending and in areas that make little to no sense for anyone other than the casual dog walker.
