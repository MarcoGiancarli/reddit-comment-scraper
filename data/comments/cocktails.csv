I know this one was being filmed by a crew but not many of others where; so I guess you have to pay tales yearly to see them. I just did this with my iPhone because I'm a rum nerd :)"
cocktails,3e4u3l,Hazomg,2,Tue Jul 21 23:34:57 2015 UTC,"Easiest answer is to follow ratios rather than quantities in recipes. So for example a Last Word is a 1:1:1:1 combination of gin, maraschino, Chartreuse, and lime juice. You could make each part 1oz (~30mL), 3/4oz (~22.5mL) or use your 25mL jigger—in any case the resulting cocktail is going to taste the same.  Where you'll have to be careful is the question of loosely defined amounts: things like ""juice of a lemon"" or ""dash of bitters"" or ""absinthe rinsed glass"". Most cocktail books should tell you what they assume the yield of any given fruit to be, so that's not too hard: just find out what they think ""juice of one lemon"" is, convert to the same measurements as the rest of the cocktail, then recalculate the ratios. Dashes, splashes, and rinses are a bit harder. If you're making a cocktail that's smaller overall than its US counterpart then you'll want to make sure your dashes of bitters, for example, are correspondingly smaller so the whole drink remains balanced. That's a skill you'll acquire by feel after some practice, though, and it's a good skill to have because not every drinks recipe is perfect in any case."

Mamnoon has really fantastic cocktails that incorporate all kinds of different middle eastern flavors. /u/mydogtherapist recommended Re:public (in South Lake Union). I'd also recommend Single Shot in Capitol Hill. It's owned by some of the same folks and has a good atmosphere and food. I always get the Percussion Cap here.   If you end up in Ballard, I'd recommend Percy's and Co., Albatross (tiki drinks, if you like that sort of thing), Barnacle (back bar for The Walrus and Carpenter restaurant). Cocktails and food at Stoneburner are pretty good too. They have good punches. Lots of folks love Bastille - some days I find it overrated, some days I'm really into it. It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to end up there. The Gerald has good cocktails but also some of the worst service I've ever experienced in Seattle.   Elsewhere - Bathtub Gin is supposed to be good, but I haven't made it in there. Zig Zag is still really good. I think Murray is now at Queen City Grill (Belltown, near Bathtub) if you want to get a drink from him. Manolin in Fremont always has good food and cocktails. Radiator Whiskey has fantastic whiskey-centric cocktails as well.  If I had to pick one or two, I'd go with Mamnoon (because I'm biased by a love for middle eastern flavors) and Needle & Thread."

cocktails,3e2bgo,schematicboy,6,Tue Jul 21 12:23:57 2015 UTC,"1)well, i can definitely suggest  a good base. i like to use Tapatio Blanco 110-proof tequila. its high enough proof that it will extract flavors to infused into your base, its a lot more interesting than using vodka & it will yield a less abrasive everclear-based product. that tequila lends itself well to aggressive flavors. i use it to make a lapsang souchong cordial at work and its pretty knock-out  2) i would suggest a dark roast. something roasted for espresso. if youre looking for a ""turkish coffee"" flavor, youre going to want the boldest flavor imaginable.  3) i would be more concerned with using not enough than too much. proportions arent going to matter that much unless youre working more delicate flavors, or fresh flora. for a liter of base, i would probably use about 10 ounces of grounds  4) this somthing that youre just going to have to monitor, but i wouldnt start the next step for at least 2-3  weeks. taste it every 5 days to see how its progressing. i would speculate that the 4th week is going to be the sweet spot  5) im personally a bigger fan of more rich sweeteners, so my vote would be for demerara syrup. if you have gum arabic and want some more body in your finished product, make a demerara gomme syrup. that rich veg funk and malty flavor i think would be ideal for that flavor. i might try a couple of ounces with turbinado sugar also just in case demerara is too rich. i"

cocktails,3e2bgo,jayeedoubleeff,2,Tue Jul 21 21:33:41 2015 UTC,"technically, any 80-proof spirit will work the higher the proof, the faster the process works, which is why many people just use everclear to extract/infuse and then rectify with water later. everclear can strip out some of the less desirable and astringent characteristics though. i use the 110-proof tequila because the flavor of an agave distillate pairs nicely with smokey and bitter flavors...like coffee...and the high proof helps expedite the process.  that said, it definitely could work. it would take a little longer though. the difference of 30 proof could mean youre going to wait a few months though rather than one month. also, even cheap mezcal is still quite expensive. some mezcals can be more aggressive than others as well, so youre going to have another element competing with the coffee flavor.  i would say that if you have the time and are willing to roll the dice, give it a shot. i would speculate that youre going to get a very different end result though."
cocktails,3e2bgo,ozzmeister00,2,Tue Jul 21 22:03:23 2015 UTC,"I did a cold brew coffee liqueur for Christmas last year, here's what I did:   Overproof spiced rum or vodka bases (I was doing both for sake of comparison; rum is better) I used a dark roast coffee (because you're going to end up diluting the flavor quite a bit, and you don't necessarily need the caffeine), with a loose grind, soaked that in water over 24 hours, then strained out the grounds. Additional filtering will help your overall product. I should have done an extra pass through fine cheesecloth. Cold brew coffee takes less time than you'd think. You could also go find yourself a coldbrew concentrate, and adjust the ratios below accordingly. The final combination was 4 parts liquor, 4 parts cold brew, 1 part simple syrup. The sugar is another good place to play with flavor. I used table sugar, but depending on what you want out of it, you could get more excitement with different sugars.   In retrospect, I would have:  1) Bought better bottles for storage and transportation. Swing tops with good rubber stoppers are the way to go  2) Not used ""Hello my name is"" stickers for labeling. They slipped right off the second the bottles started to sweat.  3) Infused with vanilla bean for a little while to add flavor complexity.  4) Picked a better decaf coffee for the decaffeinated version."
cocktails,3e2bgo,ozzmeister00,2,Tue Jul 21 20:05:07 2015 UTC,Thanks for the detailed instructions. When my roommate and I make batches of coldbrew we usually give it 12 hours. Is there any particular reason you make the cold-brew in water as opposed to the booze?
cocktails,3e2bgo,saynotovoodoo,2,Tue Jul 21 21:35:13 2015 UTC,"It's partly because I'm more comfortable brewing with water. It's a known quantity, and if I make too much for the liquor production I've still got something drinkable in the morning. With my ratios, I end up with a product in the 20% ABV range, which is what I was shooting for to begin with.  It also means I don't lose any volume of booze getting soaked into coffee beans."

cocktails,3e3reu,scenny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:39:49 2015 UTC,"Well, once you put something else in it, it stops becoming a mint julep. Since the mint julep is the pinnacle of all cocktails, this is inadvisable. However, if you insist making such a mistake consider:   Fresh Rosemary - brings some woodiness into the syrup. Steep for a very short time, as there are bitter elements in rosemary that will ruin your already ruined drink. Cinnamon and cardomon - spice that thing up like it was a curry. Of course that is most likely gonna overwhelm your mint, but these are the choices you have made in life. Peaches - add some stone fruit sweetness to add a bit of extra summer edge to your drink. Cover up your cocktail sins by calling it sweet bourbon tea. More mint - the thing a lackluster julep needs is of course, more mint. Or a higher ABV bourbon."

cocktails,3dytgh,MONDARIZ,5,Tue Jul 21 07:42:47 2015 UTC,"Why, thank you! If you want to know exactly how much ice will melt, you can calculate the specific heat of the liquor you are mixing by figuring out the ratios of water and ABV. The S value of ethyl alcohol is 2.460 J/g o C and for water is 4.184 J/g o C. Figure out the volume of alcohol, water, and the starting temp. The amount of ice doesn't really matter as long as you have enough in there.  Ice to water takes about 335 Joules per gram. So, the amount of water that will be added is:  q=MSΔT  ΔT= 0 - Ti of liquid being cooled in Celsius   Qout=[{(mL of H20 in liquor (mL-(mL* ‰abv))(1 g/1mL)(4.184 J/g o C)}+{(mL of ethyl alcohol(mL* ‰abv))(0.789 g/cm3)(2.460 J/g o C)}]*(ΔT)  Qout=-Qin (heat into the ice) volume of ice to melt in mL =~ Qin/335 J  These numbers budge around a bit as temp shifts, so it isn't an exact calculation, especially since it doesn't account for anything else in solution and assumes spherical cows for your booze."

cocktails,3e05wm,ColonelTiki,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know of an online source handy, unfortunately. I've given talks/seminars about it (My method at least), and I've also given those who didn't know what they were getting into far too much information at events and gatherings. Here are some quick tips that influence a ""style"" of Rum:   What form of sugar is used? Anything from Fresh-pressed cane juice (Agricoles/Rhum) on through to the very end Molasses (Jamaica, Bajan, etc.) is used - this influences flavor. What culture colonized the island(s) - French Rhum distillation is different from Spanish Ron vs. English Rum, etc. This also influences flavor How is the rum aged? - you guessed it - another factor of flavor.   These 3 things get you into about 5 or 6 or 7? different styles that I use -- this is my own method to make sense of the rum world -- others may have differing methods:   Jamaica Rum (English) Bajan Rum (English) Virgin Islands / Santa Cruz / Spanish 'dry' (English, Spanish, American) Demerara (Guyana) Central American (Spanish) Agricoles/Martinique (French) Colonial (American)   Then comes the history to better inform. For example: JAMAICA RUM:  Jamaica was known for it's highly refined sugar. How did they do this? They had a technology to better drain out inmpurities in the sugar. Where did those 'impurities' go? Into the Molasses. This makes the molasses rich in complex chemicals, which when expressed in a Pot Still through the heads (and some tails) are responsible for the 'funky' rich flavors we associate with Jamaica Rum such as Meyers, Coruba, Wray & Neph, Smith & Cross, Etc.  This is also why the term ""Dark Rum"" means absolutely nothing without the context of a recipe or some history of the recipe for a cocktail. Which Dark rum? Whalers is v. different from Pusser's which is different from Goslings -- none of which are Jamaica nor do they taste similar. etc.  PS feel free to PM me with questions that I'll try to answer in a non-vague and wandery kind of way. :)  etc."

Regarding the Grand Marnier, I tried with cointreau and it just didn't taste right, and unless you shop online, you just cant get a decent curaçao in the UK from anywhere I have looked, plus I asked for orange curaçao for birthdays and christmas and I got Grand Marnier, so I have a lot of bottles to use up.

If this were a standard cocktail like the whiskey sour then your minor modifications to the base spirit and garnish would be of little concern but with the oft-bastardized mai tai, the devil really is in the details. As some have already mentioned, the mint and lime garnish really changes the experience of the drink, but the biggest defining characteristic of a true mai tai is the Jamaican rum. Sure, you can substitute another rum and have a nice drink but the real mai tai uses Jamaican rum (it also doesn't call have a float so don't go out of your way for that detail). The interplay between the richness of the orgeat, the sweet and tart combination of orange curacao and lime juice, and the funky fruitiness of the Jamaican rum is the heart of the drink.   As for rum combinations and types, much and more has been written on this topic, I'll simply say that you could do a lot worse than one ounce of Appleton V/X and one ounce of Barbancourt 5 star (8 year)."

If you go, don't stay in Monteleone! /u/everydaydrinkers is right, the elevators can be a mess."
cocktails,3dzdy8,JuliasCocktails,3,Tue Jul 21 01:00:03 2015 UTC,"I do end up at Monteleone every year, but I'm kinda lazy. I use the secondary elevators in the lobby that nobody knows about and get down quickly :) Sssh, just don't tell anyone (you'd think they'd see them, they're right beside the Carousel bar :) )   The main elevators are just an express way to the roof for events and promotions."
cocktails,3dzdy8,everydaydrinkers,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:40 2015 UTC,"Last year we stayed at the Monteleone but asked for a ""low"" floor, so we managed to use the stairway most of the time. Sneaky! Never tried Royal Sonesta, though I don't have a good reason..."

cocktails,3dzdy8,everydaydrinkers,2,Tue Jul 21 02:34:10 2015 UTC,"I work here in New Orleans at a restaurant with a ""celebrity"" bartender. TotC is a blast, it's extremely worth attending. So many amazing events, tons of great bartenders, and many, many opportunities to sample their genius. A time to taste limited edition/extra special products from different brands. Plus, since a lot the attendees of the event are bartenders/service industry themselves, it's just an overall resepectful, fun crowd in town!"
cocktails,3dzdy8,rawmaterial,2,Tue Jul 21 04:59:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not from New Orleans, so here's my take this year:   I went to two seminars (the cost of two covers a wristband for the tasting events). I love hearing David Wondrich speak, and saw Jeff Beachbum Berry as well in a World War two class that was interesting but a little useless. The second was a ted-talk,  where a bunch of speakers went on very different topics. 10/10 would do again   . - I went to two tastings. They are huge, the lines are long, so I went to one for funky indie spirits (I'm the purchaser for my bar) which was cool to see what other parts of the US are bringing in to my area soon. The second one of my reps (for an indie spirits company that holds some major brand pull) brought me to a private tasting on El Dorado 25, and all the expressions and marks used to compile it. Super spirits nerd-out. I recommend contacting your bar reps; they can pull strings and even sponsor you for classes. (If you work in a bar... which I'm assuming you do)   And I went to two major parties. There are almost 100 events I would have been running around trying to catch. I went to the Welcome Party hosted by Pernod-Ricard that had bartenders from all over shaking their contest winning submissions. It was badass. More badass was Bar Fight.  86co sponsored a few world wide bars to shake up (or not shake up with crazy molecular cocktails) in competition right there. Best event behind spirited awards, which I had to jet home before. I also went to a Cuttysark event and the USBG toast, but because I'm from Texas and we have to be bigger and better. Which we are.   However, I didn't want to get sucked in so I explored the city. I made friends with some locals who showed me around, and met up with some ToTC veterans who showed me around too. I've been to NOLA a few times, but even going alone I had a great time eating and drinking at local watering holes."
cocktails,3dzdy8,MsMaddison22,2,Tue Jul 21 14:29:27 2015 UTC,"Went for the first time this year. ""Worth going"" depends on your goal I suppose. I went to get content, knowledge, and industry contacts for future booze writing. Other reasons:   To drink a lotta free booze? Worth it. To eat really good NOLA food? Worth it. To learn about cocktails from the biggest names in the industry? Worth it. To party with your friends? Prolly not, you'll miss most of the seminars and you can buy a lot of booze for the cost of airfare and hotel and just be drunk at home."
cocktails,3dzdy8,simplecocktails,2,Tue Jul 21 17:53:22 2015 UTC,"I did a mix of party with friends and events. I didn't do any of the nightly big events, instead my co-host and friends crawled through NOLA (we did do the Daiquiri bus) and went to many of the big name bars to have a drink, although I did miss latitude and went to Tiki Tolteca instead."
cocktails,3dzdy8,everydaydrinkers,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:07 2015 UTC,"We did 2 of the night events (Pernod Ricard and Diageo). They were pretty fun, though I heard Diageo became a bit of a shitshow by the end (i.e drunkenness, brawls, drunken brawls).  Lol Daiquiri bus. Good on ya."

cocktails,3dy6h3,grfx,5,Mon Jul 20 14:28:54 2015 UTC,"Those laws are not enforced unless there is a complaint. Iirc, a couple of years ago there were several busts of NY and NJ bars for filling up premium liquor bottles with cheaper brands, or I think in one case, rubbing alcohol and food coloring. None of these were cocktail bars.  People come to places like The Dead Rabbit expecting cheaters and tincture bottles everywhere, that's part of he appeal, so no one complains."
cocktails,3dy6h3,paladinmantis,3,Mon Jul 20 19:05:31 2015 UTC,"It has to be beyond there just not being complaints. Your saying i could just call the SLA and file a complaint and get Dead Rabbit shut down? That cant be the only reason. I think it is a resources thing, SLA doesnt have enough resources to police the metro area, where if you live in a smaller area they have the resources to enforce every license."
cocktails,3dy6h3,paladinmantis,2,Mon Jul 20 21:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was being somewhat general. I know in the case of those busts they sent investigators in several times to order different liquors, and then sneak them out and lab test them. I'm sure out of the thousands of bars across the NYC metropolitan area there a only enough SLA agents to investigate the most serious accusations, and probably only after repeated complaints"
cocktails,3dy6h3,LumancerErrant,4,Mon Jul 20 22:55:44 2015 UTC,"As others have already said, the laws are probably just not being enforced, and the bar owners may not even be aware of them. That can change very quickly if the SLA decides they want to do so, as happened in SF a few years back. The upside is, the existential threat to small business & good booze this sudden enforcement posed was enough to get the laws ammended pretty damned quick in the SF case. I imagine NY's will pan out the same way, if it pans at all."
cocktails,3dy6h3,AbeFromanLuvsSausage,3,Mon Jul 20 18:12:30 2015 UTC,"I think they just do them anyway as no one checks in on that type of stuff. From my experience, no one advertises that they do it, they just do it anyway?"

Alcohol sucks flavor from juices, peels, etc. It's a great stabilizer and what you sound like you need is a great stabilizer. Get some blood oranges (if they're in season), maybe soak the peels in 20% of the bottle, and the flesh in the rest, and combine with some sugar and angostura bitters when you get there, with a dash of maybe a lime or lemon? Or sweeten it with a good bottle of grenadine (although most good grenadine needs to be stored in a fridge, you can bring an unopened bottle and finish it while you're there) :)"

If you're interested in making classics, etc. I would pick up some brandy or cognac. Germain Robin is inexpensive and delicious. Also, let's talk r(h)um. Jamaican: Smith & Cross or Appleton 12. Demerara: El Dorado 8 or 12. ""Gold"" or ""Amber"": Plantation 5 star. Big and fruity: Banks 5 Island. Rhum Agricole: Neisson (go young). Rhum: Barbancourt 8. Sipping rum: Plantation 20th Anniversary, Ron Zacapa 23....I could go on and on.   Also, maybe some Mezcal? Don Maguey's Vida Organic Mezcal is a fantastic way to start. Aquavit? Pisco? Cachaca? I'm noticing you don't have much in the realms of liqueurs. Some ideas:  Vermouths/Aromatized Wines: Carpano Antica, Carpano Bianco, Lillet Blanc (make some Corpse Reviver #2s), Cocchi Torino, Punt e Mes. Owning different vermouths helps you better understand its place in a cocktail.  Liqueurs/Amari/Etc. Fernet Branca,  Aperol, St. Germain (ketchup), Green Chartreuse, Luxardo Maraschino (Maraska is cool too), Benedictine, St. Elizabeth All Spice Dram, Rothman & Winter Creme de Violette, Ancho Reyes. I could go on.  If it were me, I'd get some decent rum and a bottle of maraschino. Then you could make plenty of new drinks: Improved, Kingston Negroni, Hemingway Daiquiri, Casino, Martinez (kind of), Bloodhound, etc."

cocktails,3dw3e4,LegiticusMaximus,4,Mon Jul 20 02:09:11 2015 UTC,"Pick up some aged rum, maybe a decent Jamaican like Appleton V/X or Appleton Estate 12 year.  El Dorado would be an even cooler choice, but it's less common than Appleton.  You should swap out that Bacardi with a different white rum when you've finished it off.  People like Flor de Caña, 10 Cane, sometimes Ron Matusalem.  I typically choose Cruzan because it's as cheap as Bacardi and much better."

I would suggest a bottle of Maraschino liqueur, or a bottle of Falernum (for those delicious Tiki drinks).  Edit: that being said green Chartreuse is a cool thing to have, and with the Maraschino you can make a The Last Word cocktail. Pretty darn good, if somewhat unusual in taste (it kinda tastes of everything).  Edit II: use your Tanquery if you are making The Last Word."

cocktails,3dw3e4,jsceva,3,Mon Jul 20 08:20:50 2015 UTC,"First, buy a bottle of orange bitters.  Second, as already suggested - get Maraschino, its needed for way too many great cocktails not to have.  Third, as also already suggested, get a brandy.  In China, probably easiest to go for a cognac, probably something like Camus or Landy VS for cocktail use. Of course, if you can actually get Germain-Robin or Osocalis, I am all for supporting the California producers.    Fourth, ignore the naysayers and get green Chartreuse sooner rather than later - it's delicious, really.  That should set you up for most classic cocktails...but I would also highly encourage you to dump the Cuervo in the toilet and buy a good blanco tequila for mixing - it might be hard in China, but you can probably get Herradura given the Brown-Forman marketing muscle.  If available, get something better - tell me whats available, I can give suggestions.  Alternatively, if you can get a decent Mezcal there's really not much better than a mezcal negroni..."

An orange-coloured orange liqueur is usually a curaçao, unless it's something like Grand Marnier, which is made with Cognac and isn't usually called a curaçao.

If you want to know more about it, Serious Eats has a good article about different types of orange liqueur.)  In any case, if your triple sec is a good one, you can use it wherever Cointreau is called for. And there are a million and one different recipes that use Cointreau."

No?  Also: Pierre Ferrand's dry curaçao is … a curaçao. As the name implies. The bottle also has the words ""triple sec"" on it but that doesn't mean that it is what any bartender would consider a regular triple sec, which in the industry is shorthand for 'either Cointreau or something very similar'. And to quote Camper English, ""The origin of the 'triple' is still up for debate, but the two leading schools of thought are 'triple distillation' versus 'three times as orangey'. Triple sec was also clear, whereas curaçaos were dark in color. Today, triple secs are usually still clear (made from a base of neutral spirits), whereas curaçaos may start that way and be colored orange, blue, and even red."""

It is more pungent and has much more of the cooling effect than its cousin the spearmint due to more menthol. Spearmint is sweeter and has a more interesting flavor (to me) You can make a mojito with either because Cubans (in Cuba) use a different species of mint all together from what I gather. That said, all mojitos I have ordered have been with spearmint. Try it with the peppermint, but I would look for a spearmint plant personally. Also,  with mint juleps spearmint is traditional there.  Edit: spearmint has clusters of serrated leaves where peppermint has individual oblong leaves."

You couldn't really get a white rum before Bacardi, but I'm sure rum, mint, sugar and lime is quite an old combination. It's only natural a company like Bacardi would suggest that people try the drink with their product.  Also, the bruised mint = bitter Mojito  is more or less a myth. I have muddled the fuck out of mint to try, but the difference was barely noticeable you just get mush floating in the glass (technically, I suppose it could depend on the type of mint). Go ahead and try it; even try to chew one and see if it's bitter. You can, however, over-muddle the lime, and that will make your Mojito bitter."

If you can afford 12-year rum, you can just by Kahlua. Second thought: Most likely, this infusion is not going to 'get better with age' considering you're not letting it sit in a barrel and do that sexy barrel dance. Third thought: Buy a decent amber rum (Plantation 5 star, Bacardi 8) and add some coarse coffee grounds of your choosing (maybe regional with the rum), and shake the bottle. This infusion shouldn't take more than a few hours -- a couple of days, depending on volume, but keep agitating the bottle. After the coffee is prevalent enough via taste test (might be gross, but in a good way), strain multiple times for sediment, dilute it with a rich demerara syrup (2:1), some caramel, and possibly some all spice or clove.  It's all an experiment. Just taste often and keep notes so you can refer back to them."

If I do go to places like this I just order something simple like a dry martini or whiskey and coke."

The quarter ounce doesn't make a huge difference in a whisky sour but it does in an old fashioned.  And for the quarter ounce you can try with 2 dashes instead of pour counting. it's way faster and in my opinion more precise.  Most of the high end bars must always use a jigger but when you're in a rush pour counting saves lives.

Also there's no such thing as a really expensive green chartreuse. It all comes from the same place.

However, I've had the same bartender make my friend and I the same drink (separate vessels) multiple times and have been able to taste the differences with ease. It's not a consistent place, it's just fun as all hell. Most of their cocktails don't have a delicate balance and are crafted that way (margin for error but still delicious). Also, free pouring cannot be a universal count, even if you use the same speed pours. Different spirits and syrups have different weights, and the amount of liquid in the bottle and angle at which is being poured all have effects on the outcome (think of a full bottle of bitters to a mostly empty one). I understand free pouring, but if you're looking for consistent quality of product and pour cost, jiggering is the way to go. Also, it doesn't even take longer if you know what you're doing. I'm pouring the jigger into the vessel while I'm grabbing the next bottle out of my speedwells. Sorry to rant."

If I have time to take the time, I'll measure it out. If I don't have time and it's something more simple, for example a Gin and Tonic, I'll use my pour counts. My pour counts are also very accurate, not to boast about my abilities, but it truly does depend on the bartender. Some drinks also walk a fine line in regards to flavor balances and following the recipe to a t is crucial in those cases. If you have worked at a bar long enough, you should know what you should and shouldn't count. And please do not be afraid to instruct your bartenders on when they should be doing this because you have had a poor experience, as we all have had, with shitty bartenders."

Anyway the syrup is pretty easy. I used a pound of basil for every gallon of (1:1) simple. Blanch the basil in boiling saltwater, immediately introduce to an ice bath. Blend the basil into the simple (with a commercial blender this is easy, without you may want to chop the basil up first.)  Then run the mixture through a fine strainer.   I was using it in ""Lawn Boy""  1.5oz Pear Williams  .5oz Yellow Chartreuse  .5oz Fresh Lemon  .5oz Basil Simple  Build over ice in a Collins, top with tonic. Garnish with a basil leaf.

If so, I can reassure you: in a cocktail, you'll definitely taste the basil, more so than mint IMHO. When a recipe asks for X mint leaves, you can use twice as many your cocktail won't be ruined, however with basil I can imagine a point where too much basil will become a bad thing.

cocktails,3dn1w7,phedre,7,Fri Jul 17 16:33:10 2015 UTC,"Are you looking for just plan tonic or more of the concentrate tonic syrups like Strong Tonic or even Jack Rudy Tonic   Regular tonic water, I find, Q Tonic does what I need it to do, but the tonic concentrates (just add to a cocktail with a main ingredient like gin and some club soda) offer more variety in a smaller size so you can have a party with 5-20 drinks in a bottle, instead of just 1 or 2."

cocktails,3dn1w7,hebug,3,Fri Jul 17 18:09:35 2015 UTC,"If you get some sort of tonic concentrate, you could try making one of Dave Arnold's most straightforward takes on the gin and tonic. First you mix the gin and tonic concentrate with water, then you stick it in the freezer until it just starts to frost over (I overshot and ended up supercooling mine which was exciting), then carbonate the hell out of it. The resulting drink is icy cold, crisp, and incredibly carbonated. I recall the gin and bitter botanicals being much more prevalent, but I imagine it would depend greatly on the ratio you use. Give it a shot, maybe you'll love it!"
cocktails,3dn1w7,MoviesAndCocktails,3,Fri Jul 17 18:29:29 2015 UTC,The only problem with this is that the sodastream is really difficult to clean. Anything besides clean water is not recommended for carbonation.
cocktails,3dn1w7,hebug,3,Fri Jul 17 18:41:54 2015 UTC,"If you're careful there's no mess. Apparently you don't actually have to fill to the fill line (though I do). When you carbonate, vent slowly. If you think of it like you're dealing with a shaken bottle of Coke, you wouldn't just tear the cap off right? Just vent it like you would one of those. When it foams up, tighten the cap until it subsides. After you're done carbonating and removed the bottle, maybe give the nozzle a quick wipe and vent to spray out any residual liquid.   The mess only happens if you're not careful and let it foam out of the bottle and up into the mechanism."
cocktails,3dn1w7,MoviesAndCocktails,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:59:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I guess I haven't been that adventurous with my sodastream yet. I haven't thought about a CIP protocol for the unit yet. I suppose one could use some sodium hydroxide, a dash of TSP, and a drop of diswasher detergent (or some other non-foaming soap.) Put that in one of the bottles with water and carbonate it. That would probably clean the nozzle well.  Are you saying that you leave the liquid level low enough that the nozzle stays out of the liqiud? If so, how long does it take to carbonate that way?    It would be fun to find a way to reliably carbonate things again. I ""borrowed"" my homebrew gear, including my CO2 stuff a while back when I didn't have the room for it and never got it back again."
cocktails,3dn1w7,hebug,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:12:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think anything significant should collect in the nozzle considering you're blasting gas out of it. IIRC, Dave Arnold carbonates with a bottle just 1/3 full or something since he doesn't want to be making a half liter of gin and tonic at once. I have a small half-sized bottle, so I just fill that all the way since it's more efficient. So I actually have no idea how long it takes to carbonate a partially full bottle.  I've not had any problems so far as long as I give the nozzle a quick wipe with a wet paper towel and then give it a quick blast to blow out any liquid."

I worked as a bartender for a while and the most important part of our job was to make what you wanted to drink, not what we wanted to show off.  Any bar with mint and limes can make you a Mojito, and since it's such a popular recipe I'm sure they're used to people ordering it even if it's not on the menu. If you ever get shit from a bartender for your order that's their problem for being a snob (and a bad service industry employee), not yours.  Plus, Mojitos are fucking delicious."

cocktails,3djx0z,lonelysamwhich,4,Fri Jul 17 03:25:23 2015 UTC,"My friend came up with a recipe that she called Beergria that's really good.  1 peach 1 nectarine 2/3 Cup peach brandy (apricot brandy works fine, too) 1 Cup peach nectar 750 ml chilled lambic (her favorite is lindemans pêche lambic) ice cubes (for serving) superfine sugar (optional)  Wash the fruits. Then, pit and slice. No peeling necessarily. NOTE: Any kind of peachy/nectarinely fruits work just fine. For this recipe, young (still hard) ones seem to work better.  Put them in a container and pour the peach brandy. If you have time, keep it in the freezer for a few hours or in the refrigerator for over night.  Just before serving, pour the peach mixture in a pitcher (or a large bowl). Add the peach nectar and stir. Set aside for 5 minutes. NOTE: If you cannot find the peach nectar, you can use 'a can of peach in its nectar or use any peachy nectar such as apricot nectar. Whatever you use, don't forget to cool it in the refrigerator.   Add the child lambic. Adjust the sweetness by adding more nectar or superfine sugar. Stir again. Serve over ice cubes."

cocktails,3djx0z,treitter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:55:56 2015 UTC,Good call. Raspberry sorbet might do well with this too.
cocktails,3djx0z,EmmetOtter,4,Fri Jul 17 20:26:29 2015 UTC,"There's so much going on with framboise lambic already that I'd focus on keeping it simple. I imagine if you add more than a few ingredients, the flavors will get a little too muddy and you wouldn't be getting anything more out of the lambic than you would with raspberry syrup + a small amount of light beer.  Tequila seems like it wouldn't mesh well with the lambic (though if you've got tequila and need to open some lambic to experiment anyhow, it'd be worth seeing how they work together).  Since you said rum, my first instinct is to try it with a rhum agricole which would have some really interesting flavors that could work well with the lambic. It could also easily be terrible but it probably wouldn't be mediocre. Only one way to find out :)  If you want to add fresh citrus, lemon should be a safe bet with the raspberry from the lambic and should work well with a cognac or other grape brandy. If you're going the r(h)um route, lime probably works best with that spirit but a combination lemon/lime like in Jeffrey Morgenthaler's margarita recipe could pull together the lambic and rum.  I'd love to know how any of these options work out and your final recipe!"
cocktails,3djx0z,rthmchgs,3,Thu Jul 16 23:52:21 2015 UTC,I'll definitely update with experiments when I do them. Though it might be delayed to next party since life has handed me a sudden crapton of errands to run.
cocktails,3djx0z,dreaday4,2,Thu Jul 16 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"You're probably going to have to experiment with this one.  A funky and cloying beer, such as a fruity lambic, is going to throw off the sweetness, sourness, and alcohol ratios of your standard punch ""formula.""    There aren't a lot of punches that use beer, so I think the easiest option is to find a recipe that already includes something tart and sweet, with bonus points for sparkling and mildly boozy.  Then start by replacing that ingredient with the fruit lambic.  I'm thinking things like shrubs (i.e., drinking vinegars), apple cider, ""medium-sweet"" wines like muscat or riesling, or a very dry champagne.  Maybe find some rum/cognac punches that might play well with the raspberry flavors and try a small batch.  Alternatively, you could start from the ground up and add ingredients to the lambic, but that way probably leads toward jungle juice instead of a ""punch.""  My favorite idea, however, is to reduce the lambic to a syrup and add just a bit to a fruity punch with complementary flavors.  Good luck."
cocktails,3dkdvr,phedre,5,Thu Jul 16 23:49:59 2015 UTC,"This is not an authentic OF, but one I tinkered with to make it a bit lighter on my low-tolerance self.   Place one sugar cube in glass (or sub simple syrup) douse liberally with peychauds bitters (used about 4 dashes from the bottle) add juice of half an orange (it was a small orange.. enough to cover the bottom of the glass) muddle the fuck out of it pour in a healthy dose of good bourbon (2 oz or so.) add a few cubes of ice add a splash of sparkling water for fizz (1 oz maybe? Enough to give it a little fizz) garnish with a luxardo maraschino cherry.    I also occasionally make this with gin. Skip the cherry, add a wedge of orange. It's delicious.  ETA: Damn, lots of fighting over this silly little post. I don't much do exact measurements, I find cocktails far too personal to the individual - I like more sour/bitter and less sweet than most people. If anyone wants exact measurements, I don't have them, but I put eyeballed measurements up top."

cocktails,3dkdvr,hebug,5,Fri Jul 17 16:20:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the updated recipe, I'm not sure what the huge fuss was, but the original recipe as given could be interpreted quite differently from your original intent. I was working on a reply expounding the details of why, but I accidentally clicked a link and now it is lost.   TL;DR version: ""Liberal"" amounts of bitters can range from measuring in oz (see the Angostura Sour or over 10 dashes (see the Sawyer). I'm no expert on oranges, but from experience, their size at the grocery store seems to vary greatly.    A healthy pour of bourbon in my mind would be greater than 2.5 oz. 1.5 or 2.0 oz is standard in the majority of cocktails I know.    I hate ""splash"" or ""top"" with soda water since it depends a lot on glass size/ice. Considering how much people obsess over avoiding overdilution and their ice, the relative lack of care over directly adding water to a drink seems backwards to me. Since I have the luxury of making drinks at home on my own time, I add sodas 0.5 oz at time when recipes don't specify, tasting as I go until I find a balance that suits me.   Anyways, thanks again for bothering to update. Sorry for the controversy, it is still the internet after all and people will get into fights over the silliest things. Cheers!"
cocktails,3dkdvr,ArtieEvans,2,Fri Jul 17 18:55:06 2015 UTC,I like the interpretation.  More in the season than the traditional.  How much bourbon did you use?  What kind is your favorite?
cocktails,3dkdvr,hebug,0,Fri Jul 17 03:47:11 2015 UTC,I just pour until it looks right - maybe 2oz? I'm not big on measurements.   Used Basil Hayden's tonight.
cocktails,3dkdvr,kaiser_xc,-10,Fri Jul 17 03:49:12 2015 UTC,"Discounting the fact that many wouldn't consider this even close to an Old-Fashioned, here are the problems with this recipe.   ""liberally"" is not a measurement. ""half an orange"" is not a measurement. ""healthy dose"" is not a measurement. ""splash"" is not a measurement.   I'm glad you enjoy it, but if you were more specific, more people might be able to too."
cocktails,3dkdvr,Killagina,0,Fri Jul 17 03:35:12 2015 UTC,"Whenever I'm not at work, and often when I am, I just eye ball stuff. Drinks should be fun. Also splash is a measurement. What do you think you'll get when you order a Cubalibre splash water? Exactly one ounce of water?  Now you could argue that this is more of a whiskey sour with orange than an old fashioned your attack on his measurements are mean spirited. Nobody measures cocktails with a pipette"
cocktails,3dkdvr,kaiser_xc,7,Fri Jul 17 04:07:39 2015 UTC,He wasn't asking for him to measure with a pipette. He was asking that if he posted a picture of a drink that maybe he would have some measurements so others could reproduce it. It is ridiculous he is getting downvoted.
cocktails,3dkdvr,Killagina,2,Fri Jul 17 04:34:41 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure, given the ""imprecise"" measurements, I could recreate a drink very similar to this. If you want to exactly recreate a a drink you'd have to use the exact same type of orange, from a similar vineyard, at the same ripeness, the same bourbon, the same type of sugar, and even ice from the same water that OP used. If you don't do this you'll get a different drink, but hell, it might even be better.   And this isn't even taking into account personal preferences. If my juice or bourbon is half an ounce off I'm still going to enjoy the drink. If there are 5 instead of 6 dashes of peychodes I'll sill enjoy it.  The problem with OP's recipe isn't that it's imprecise, it's that people get too caught up in their OCD. Relax and have a drink."
cocktails,3dkdvr,kaiser_xc,-2,Fri Jul 17 04:46:16 2015 UTC,"No you wouldn't. That is the most fucking ridiculous thing. Recipes universally call for the use of a certain amount of oz of life juice, or lemon juice, etc. Not lemons grown in the south of Italy. You are making an argument that doesn't exist. The only time I've seen specific citrus being brought up is when discussing grape fruit.   No one is asking for a perfect measurement. Give approximate measurements. He posted his unique take on a cocktail. He should provide general guidelines. As long as you use similar proportions you are going to have a very similar drink.   Something better would be:   1 sugar cube approx 3 dashes Peychauds approx .5 oz orange juice   muddle till sugar is dissolved   2 oz bourbon splash of sparkling water Garnish with a cheery   Still sounds like an old fashion to me. Though one I personally wouldn't enjoy a lot, and definitely not a whiskey sour as there is no egg white. Honestly though if you are posting your take on a recipe give some decent guidelines."
cocktails,3dkdvr,Killagina,2,Fri Jul 17 05:02:42 2015 UTC,"One of the first recipes:J.E. Alexander describes the cocktail similarly in 1833, as he encountered it in New York City, as being rum, gin, or brandy, significant water, bitters, and sugar, though he includes a nutmeg garnish as well. What does significant water mean? I don't know, but I'm sure it was delicious.   Also half a lime or lemon is roughly 1oz. so I would imagine that an orange would be even more. But you just made a recipe yourself so it obviously wasn't that hard to deduce what he meant.  and not to be too pedantic but a sour is any citrus, sugar and alcohol. Egg whites are awesome in them but hardly definitive."

cocktails,3diwnc,dilby33,2,Thu Jul 16 18:59:47 2015 UTC,I made my first Boulevardier over the 4th of July. I ordered one at a restaurant a week before and thought it was delicious; mine not so much. I used the same recipe as you (Rittenhouse) but sweet vermouth instead of Carpano Antico (because all I had was sweet vermouth). It just tasted like a really strong drink and didn't balance the strong bitterness and the strong flavor of the higher proof whiskey. Is this just an acquired taste that I will develop or does using Carpano Antico really change the whole drink and balance things much better than sweet vermouth
cocktails,3diwnc,ems88,3,Thu Jul 16 20:01:38 2015 UTC,"Carpano Antica is richer and more flavorful than most vermouths, so it stands up to the strong flavors of the Campari and rye well.  What sweet vermouth did you use?  How long had it been open?  How was it stored?"
cocktails,3diwnc,dilby33,2,Fri Jul 17 13:15:54 2015 UTC,"I believe it was Martini & Rossi sweet vermouth. Not going to lie, it is old... At least 4 months. It was stored in the fridge the whole time. I know vermouth goes bad pretty quickly, but what happens to it taste-wise when it goes bad?   Do you think the fact that I used old vermouth is the reason or do you think, when making it with a strong rye, it really needs the Carpano Antica?"
cocktails,3diwnc,atxcojo,3,Fri Jul 17 14:32:27 2015 UTC,"I think 4 month old Martini & Rossi isn't going to taste good in cocktails.  Nicer liquor stores will have some good vermouths in 375ml bottles (about 12 oz), so it's more likely you'll use it before it turns.  Store in the refrigerator and, if possible, vacuum seal (hand pump with a couple vacuum corks is <$10).  Like wine, vermouth oxidizes.  The flavor becomes flat and off flavors develop.  I love making Manhattans for people who have only had them with a neon colored cherry made with improperly stored vermouth (more likely than not shaken) because it makes me look like a wizard."

cocktails,3diwnc,whatzen,2,Thu Jul 16 20:44:28 2015 UTC,"1.5oz bourbon, generally Buffalo Trace 1oz Campari 1oz Vermouth, generally Carpano Antica 1 small pinch of salt OPTIONAL: 1 dash Fees/Regans orange bitters (I keep a dasher filled with a 50/50 ratio)    The dash of salt adds just a hint of savory flavor that, while subtle, really adds to the drink IMO.  It's a trick that works for a lot of drinks (try it in a Negroni as well).  You should never add enough salt that the drink actually tastes anywhere near salty.  A dash of bitters might be overkill but if you're ready for a bitter drink its a bit of additional flavor and complexity.  I wouldn't go from a sweeter drink to this but if I'm already drinking bitter cocktails I think it works."
cocktails,3diwnc,Submersed,2,Fri Jul 17 00:12:44 2015 UTC,"I haven't been able to bring myself to enjoy Campari, and I'm really not sure why. I've even had a few others try drinks I've made with Campari, and they just don't like them, even if I use only drops of it. People describe it as ""attacking"" the pallet, in an unpleasant way."
cocktails,3diwnc,BklynMoonshiner,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:54:35 2015 UTC,"I would suggest you try Aperol instead, it's more mellow. Campari can be an acquired taste but once you start to appreciate these bitters hardly anything beats it imo."
cocktails,3diwnc,tone-e,2,Fri Jul 17 12:36:57 2015 UTC,"Just to make sure I'm not screwing something else up, would you say Campari stays on the pallet for quite a while, and also resembles a more natural tasting Robitussin? Thank you for the Aperol recommendation, I'll give that a shot. I'm trying to get better at making cocktails but having a hard time combining better (and more classic) ingredients with what I personally enjoy. I'll continue to try Campari as well to see if I begin to appreciate it more."

cocktails,3djbwj,Mr_Fahrenheit_451,2,Fri Jul 17 02:02:58 2015 UTC,"Dried hibiscus flowers are easy to find.  I make mine very concentrated:  I start with a 1:1 simple syrup and add 2 quarts by volume of dried flowers to 8 quarts of syrup and bring it to a boil.  I simmer for 15-20 minutes.  Let it cool before straining, because a lot of the flavor transfer happens just by the flowers steeping as it cools.  I have never used more than a half ounce of this syrup in a cocktail and it always comes through."

I don't accept the Tommy's as a real Marg anyway, because the whole point of a Margarita is that it's a Daisy, meaning it has orange liqueur in it.   I'm being an asshole, but it's a weird claim to say things without orange liqueur are margaritas. It's like saying a sidecar is just sugar, cognac and lemon juice."

cocktails,3dfn9x,i_am_socrates,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:07:07 2015 UTC,"That ratio makes some sense, but it depends on a couple factors:    How sugary is the triple sec? Some things that are 15% ABV are way sweeter than Cointreau (which is 40% ABV); some are not, so it just depends.  How sweet is the lime juice that you're using? Even though fresh (or 4 hour old) lime juice is best, lime naturally vary in terms of sweetness. Sweeter, more flavorful limes naturally need less compensation.    This is all making me want a marg really bad."
cocktails,3dfn9x,not_thrilled,6,Thu Jul 16 19:14:24 2015 UTC,How is it? It seems like a totally absurd amount of lime juice compared to a real Margarita.
cocktails,3dfn9x,Tullimory,3,Thu Jul 16 00:04:30 2015 UTC,"I think it comes out great.  Alton recommends using 4 limes, which definitely seems absurd.  2 limes is about 2oz of fluid, more or less, depending on the size of the lime.  The Tippling Bros use 1oz lime juice in their recipe, but they also don't use orange juice, but a grand marnier syrup instead.  I think a good adjustment might be to use a little more tequila, ~2.5 oz, but I probably wouldn't scale back the limes."
cocktails,3dfn9x,The-Good-Doctor,5,Thu Jul 16 00:09:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ""standard"" margarita is 3-2-1 tequila-lime-triple sec so 4 limes seems like a bit of overkill. Honestly I prefer measurements in oz as the yield on some fruits can vary wildly."

There are a ton of recipes out there that talk about fruits as units, not always the best if you're trying to be exact, but at the same time maybe the recipe calls for some variation anyways?"
cocktails,3dfn9x,Tullimory,3,Thu Jul 16 00:28:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that one shouldn't too zealously stick to the recipe. Taste is always the ultimate criterion. I have just found that a very small amount of variation can really change the flavor of a drink. I'm not too familiar with Alton brown, but I was under the impression he was supposed to be a bit of a food science geek. I'm surprised his recipes don't reflect that."
cocktails,3dfn9x,Tullimory,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:36:34 2015 UTC,"But keep in mind that his background is video production, not food science. He found a niche and filled it - doesn't necessarily mean that he's the best at it. I'm a fan (or used to be, before he turned into just another Food Network face), but he's second tier as a food scientist behind Harold McGee, Shirley Corriher (who was on his show a few times in the early days), and Kenji from Serious Eats."

cocktails,3dfn9x,No1forCocktails,5,Thu Jul 16 17:51:13 2015 UTC,"Ah, for me 2 limes is typically closer to 3 oz., which inverts the usual ratio of tequila to lime. If he really said 4 limes, and if he's not talking key limes, then I have to consider him crazy."
cocktails,3dfn9x,ofthedappersort,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:33:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm still not entirely sure how he justifies 4 limes.  He claims you don't use the complete amount of juice from the latter two, since you're just muddling them, but that doesn't make sense since you're mashing them.  I bet you're right with regards to the amount of juice extracted from an average lime.  I've always hand squeezed, but as you could tell from the photo I recently got a plastic juicer so I probably netted closer to 2.5-3oz of lime fluid."

You probably don't really need any equipment other than something to measure the ingredients, a spoon, and maybe a knife if you're using any fruit.  Rather than using a shaker, you can just stir the drinks with ice in a separate glass and then pour them into the serving glass, holding back the ice.    Keep things simple and learn from this experience.  Then you'll know what you may want to try or do differently next time."

I've never tried it, but I think other people use a food processor and then strain out the fruit pulp and retain the juice. A masticating juicer is great because it really 'squeezes' the fruit without heating it up (some blade juicers heat  it up and eliminate flavours/enzymes in the process)."

Then drop into bath of water with a different chemical. So it's more time consuming rather than difficult. Wouldn't make on regular basis but for a party or special occasion definitely worth it.

Fresh sage goes amazingly well with bourbon, especially if you’ve chosen a bourbon with a higher rye content.

Purely conjecture since I haven't made it but I guess it would look something like:  1 1/2 oz malibu  1/2 oz vodka (do you really need it in there at all?)  1 3/4 oz cranberry  1/2 oz orange  1/2 oz pineapple  3/4 to 1 oz lime  It'll definitely be pinker but taste and see if it's good and if not just adjust the proportions to taste.

cocktails,3dava9,Reddit-Hivemind,12,Tue Jul 14 21:10:10 2015 UTC,"Angostura and Peychaud's (I often use the latter in place of the former) are musts, as is Orange. I like Fee's for gin and tequila drinks, Regan's for whiskey and brandy.  Others: Woodford's Spiced Cherry bitters are great in Manhattans. Bitterman's Hopped Grapefruit work well in a lot of gin and tequila cocktails. I haven't had any yet, but I keep hearing good things about Mole bitters."
cocktails,3dava9,raevnos,3,Tue Jul 14 21:20:57 2015 UTC,"I see the Xocaltal (sp?) bitters used in lots of recipes - what's the difference between these and the Fee Bros Aztec choc bitters, or the Bitter Truth ones?"
cocktails,3dava9,budgie93,10,Tue Jul 14 21:59:29 2015 UTC,"Bittermen's Xocolatl Mole are the best chocolate bitters out there. They have good heavy cacao flavor and good mole spice that is way more interesting than any others I've tried. Fee's Aztec Chocolate are super cinnamon-y, almost like red hot candies, and a bit sweet for my taste. Haven't had the Bitter Truth Chocolate, but I do like their other bitters."
cocktails,3dava9,tone-e,5,Tue Jul 14 22:58:49 2015 UTC,"The only chocolate bitters I've had are Scrappy's, which are very one note chocolate. The Mole ones are supposed to have more of a spicier and complicated flavor. It's just different brands going for the same idea, with different recipes.  Much like orange bitters, the best approach is try a few and find out which one you like. It'd be nice if more bitters companies did what Scrappy's does and offers sample packs of small bottles."
cocktails,3dava9,raevnos,2,Tue Jul 14 23:04:16 2015 UTC,"Chocolate or mole bitters are useful to add a chocolate element without adding the substantial sweetness of a liqueur.  I don't know of a better way to accomplish that flavor.  In terms of production the Xocolatyl Mole bitters were developed by Bittermen's in Brooklyn (who later moved to New Orleans) and the recipe was licensed by Bitter Truth from Germany (near Munich, I think).  The difference between the mole bitters and the Fee's Aztec Chocolate is the spiced chocolate element to the mole.  The Aztec bitters have a bit of a chalky flavor.  Think Hershey's Kisses.  Scrappy's Chocolate is more like rich hot chocolate, and also un-spiced.  Scrappy's, Bittermen's, and Bitter Truth are all alcohol-based.  Fee's is (mostly) glycerine-based.  I'm not nearly enough of a scientist to tell you how that affects the kind of flavors that are extracted, but I do feel like the Fee's bitters lack the depth of chocolate flavor of the others.  With the Bitter Truth and Bittermen's mole bitters, I find the BT bitters to be drier, with more emphasis on the spice than the chocolate.  BM's is a little more chocolate focused, sweeter, and overall more balanced.  Bittermen's comes in a dropper bottle instead of a dasher like the other three.  This allows for more consistent application but is also more time consuming.  My recommendation is to get the Scrappy's Chocolate.  If you want a spiced chocolate flavor you can pair them with Angostura or allspice dram (or a number of other bitters or liqueurs).  The mole bitters are less versatile, because they always bring the spiced element.  Side Note: Angostura, Peychaud's, and Orange bitters first.  Then branch out.  Even with a wide array of bitters, I still use those three bottles more than almost anything else."

Met a few just yesterday at tales of the cocktail too.
cocktails,3dava9,stgabe,2,Thu Jul 16 19:15:49 2015 UTC,Get Angostura and then Regan's orange bitters.  Those will do you for most drinks.  If you want to get a little more fancy grab a bottle of Fee's orange bitters.  You can try those against the Regan's to see what you like or you can do what many of us do and put together a mix of half Regan's and half Fee's to get some of the best characteristics of both.  Any other bitters are just drink dependent.  If you like Manhattans and Old Fashioneds then you'll probably love a Sazerac and you'll need Peychaud's for that.  The other stuff is more specialized.  I'd branch out more when you find a drink you really want to try that uses a different bitter.
cocktails,3dava9,stgabe,3,Tue Jul 14 22:58:12 2015 UTC,Love sazeracs but I don't plan to buy absinthe for the rinse. Workaround? Otherwise I'll just treat myself to it at bars. Thanks for the tips btw
cocktails,3dava9,stuph,8,Tue Jul 14 23:05:33 2015 UTC,I use Herbsaint which is gets very close IMO and is more affordable.  I might upgrade to absinthe at some point.  You use so little per drink that one bottle effectively lasts forever (I think I've been working on the same bottle of Herbsaint for 4 years and it's still half full).

cocktails,3dava9,hellomcfly13,2,Wed Jul 15 00:03:08 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned, at least a few absinthe brands have tiny bottles which will last for quite a few rinses.  If you want to make your little bottle of absinthe last FOREVER, spend $3-4 on an atomizer (little spray bottle).  A few sprays of absinthe will coat your glass without needing to dump out any excess.  You may not think you'll use it much, but an absinthe rinse is just a step down from the versatility of most bitters in terms of its ability to add that finishing touch to a cocktail."

cocktails,3dava9,Booler,4,Wed Jul 15 11:41:41 2015 UTC,"I'd go with Angustora and orange bitters. Peychauds is great but its not as widely used.  Fees is not really bitters, but flavoring. IIRC a lot of their products aren't even alcoholic. If you want an aromatic orange I'd go with straight up Regan's orange bitters or Angustora orange. I've heard some people mix regans and fee brothers 50/50 to give it more of a citrus pop."

cocktails,3da13f,ajcfood,3,Tue Jul 14 21:27:39 2015 UTC,"I listened. First of all, great job and congrats. Starting something new like this is a big deal. I have several critiques which I hope are all constructive. A lot of these are personal in nature so take it with a grain of salt.   Like /u/Spike_Dougan said below, I wish your voice was more natural. I wouldn't say your voice was strained or forced, but it felt like a voice over (at times) for a personal piece on an evening news segment. In fact, one time during the interview you started speaking and I thought it was narration, but in fact you were responding directly to the interviewee!   On a personal note regarding the voice, I like the host(s) to be conversational, bounce off one another. Now, if it's just one person, I prefer their narration to be relaxed, at ease, but natural to the personality of the person, and to be honest, more concise. It's a hard balanced to have your script polished while not coming off as forced. Maybe like NPR.   I would give a listen to ""Mystery Show"". There is something about that style I love from a single host, and I wonder if you are going for that format. Your thoughts interspersed with interviews.  I found that there was a lot going on, so I lost focus after a while because it took a while to get to a topic. I relistened to the ""In Defense Of"" segment. I feel like it took a while for you to get to the point, and I was waiting for specifics. I feel like you were saying a lot about conclusion of your thoughts without really laying out the topic. I would have wanted to first hear about details of flavored whiskey. You did get to some examples, but it came after I lost focus from your introduction. Plus, you did not go into detail about the flavored whiskeys that much. So I think that coherence was missing in this section.  On a personal note: I was definitely not convinced that flavor whiskeys deserve any defense, especially after you ended with Fireball. I would suggest you know your audience and realize that when the topic is introduced to them, they will indeed scoff at the thesis (flavored whiskeys deserve some respect). Go with that, and talk about the details of the flavored whiskeys and give credence to WHY they are shit upon. But then, slowly, give us insight into why these are actually not that bad, sprinkled with examples. I would have liked to hear your personal discovery of why and how you came to defend flavored whiskey's instead of hearing your opinion right away.   Another point: it seemed that you ended the In Defense Of segment, but then continued with the topic. That transition was not clear to me.   The music at the end was too loud over the ending quote. I mean, I couldn't hear the last few words at all. And there were a few instances of a stutter which could easily be edited out.  On a last personal note: I would want to hear about recipes. About specific liquids, whether it's a new liquor, a new distillery, a line of bitters, etc. Or the history of a classic cocktail, or a reconstruction of a drink.   So, I would polish up how clear and coherent the script is, and figure out what you want to do with your narration style. I cannot imagine preparing a script or outline for a blog if I was doing it by myself. And while it seems easier to bounce back and forth with a co-host, I could see that turning into just two people dicking around (the only instance that works is the comedy podcast U Talkin' U2 To Me? ... which is the best).   I say listen to more podcasts, see what you like from those, think about how they are structured, how they describe their topic, how they convey personality and personal opinion while also informing the listener. I would think about those things first before figuring out how the heck to make it entertaining, which seems really hard.  Hope this helps. I will listen to it again in the future, maybe a few episodes down the line to see how it has changed. Best of luck."

In short it makes for a great old fashioned since its aromas are generally quite sweet expected from any bourbon but its rye content gives more spiced notes on the pallette, so the sugar and bitters just extended its character and the dilution brightens the whiskey."

You have to put the youngest as the age statement, so bottles will begin to be ageless while they catch up with demand.  Rittenhouse 100 changed their labling from the original black label to a more trendy modern-looking maroon label.

If you like rye a lot (and I do) try instead a ""improved whisky cocktail"" in the PDT cocktail book with it.

Incredible bourbon with a great price and works amazing with a simple old fashioned (one that is just bitters sugar and whisky-if you are putting seltzer in there then personally you are doing it wrong)  Good luck on your whisky journey- I up voted anyone who said anything about high west cause that stuff is the shit.

cocktails,3d9yjc,AlcoholicWomanizer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"We always stir our martinis in a metal tin, as metal can cool very quickly, which helps us reach the right temperature at the right point of dilution.   Chemical Engineer here. The cooling effect is due to ice melting, not from anything coming from the container. A metal tin conducts heat much faster than a glass. (This is why the outside feels cold. It is extracting heat from your hand.) So the ice will melt faster.   Regardless of container, getting to the same condition for the martini will require the same amount of ice melt, the same dilution. It will just happen faster in a metal tin."

Bulleit is my go-to mixing bourbon especially for experiments like this because it is affordable and I personally appreciate the rye-forward mash bill when mixing a drink that may risk running sweet.  Also, I'd warn against using an old peel for this, most of the flavor is going to come from the citrus oil which is best from as fresh as possible. Also, if you harvest the rind from a whole fruit you can avoid the pith as much as possible because it may add an unpleasant tinge. Especially from grapefruit."

cocktails,3d6gam,tone-e,5,Tue Jul 14 04:11:57 2015 UTC,"Saw this at work earlier and realized I had a grapefruit in the fridge so I replicated the recipe as best I could.  I wish I used more brown sugar, normally I like my drinks less sweet but now that I've tried it I think I wouldn't mind the brown sugar sweetness as much, and the flavor is really nice with the bourbon. I went with Fee Bro's aromatic bitters - I'm normally not big on them but it's really cinnamon forward and I think it worked well with the brown sugar. The grapefruit rind is a great touch, I think, and not something I would have expected to go so well with brown sugar.  Mine didn't look as nice as yours, but I thought it tasted great. If you ask me this is a really awesome take on an old fashioned, different enough to be creative, but close enough to not feel like you're messing up a good thing. I'll probably steal it sometime when I have friends over."
cocktails,3d6gam,AlcoholicWomanizer,2,Tue Jul 14 03:00:30 2015 UTC,Oh good! Happy it wasn't a fluke.

cocktails,3d6iek,PeterPanPulse,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:32:53 2015 UTC,"I second this Clement and Vida decision. However, do note that Vida, although delicious, is not technically traditional mescal. Ron Cooper and several bartenders worked with the farmers in San Luis Del Rio to create a certain blend and distillation process to get a specific flavor profile (more smoke, less astringency) at a much lower price point. However, it is the most affordable mescal that actually has flavor integrity and quality...Alipus is grand too, but I don't think you can get that in the UK."

Going lighter on the booze doesn't just make a drink less alcoholic, it can also create balance issues.  For an example, others have mentioned problems with a 1:1:1 Margarita ratio, which I believe would bury the tequila.  A good rule of thumb is 2:1:1 on a lot of classic cocktails.  These are all preference though, and if your friends (or customers) enjoy the drinks you make then keep on with it, but if you ever find something too cloying the solution may simply be to kick up the main ingredient a notch."

For a traditional 5 element punch you start with sugar and aromatic (oleo-saccharum) and add a sour element (lemon juice) to make rump sherbert.  The addition of a weak element (water) gives you an old-fashioned sherbert.  With the addition of a strong element (alcohol) this gives you a classic 5 element punch.  I've only seen sherberts made for punches at Dead Rabbit in NYC. I originally kept thinking they were grabbing some frozen sherbert from the grocery store to make drinks so I had to ask.

Pomegranate syrup makes a great sub for grenadine, lime obviously works for Sweetened Lime, and they usually also have a plain syrup that subs perfectly for simple.  Also, while it would reduce the potency of your drinks, the syrups can also replace sugar-laden liqueurs, orange syrup for triple sec, peppermint for mint schnapps, etc etc.  Really so far the only drinks I've found that I can't recreate are ones with orange juice (syrup just can't replicate the texture and real flavor of the juice, it tastes like the artificial orange in liqueurs) or ones that use sugary liqueurs with flavors too complex to be replicated in a syrup.  EDIT: I just realized you asked about -bars-, sorry, this really only helps for making drinks at home."

Let's just say 0.5g/ml, for simplicity. 1 tsp of granulated sugar is about 4g, so you're going to want 8ml of simple syrup, so 1.6 tsp or so. Or, for simplicity, 0.25oz, which is about 7.4ml."
cocktails,3d2k2v,Scrofuloid,4,Mon Jul 13 06:20:36 2015 UTC,g/oz is a fucking weird measurement and water measured at 0.93 g/ml make me highly suspect.

cocktails,3d2k2v,OrangeCantRhyme,3,Mon Jul 13 23:01:04 2015 UTC,"If it's unflavored simple syrup, then I'd suggest using a bit more than if you were to use granulated or cubed sugar. Even at 1:1, a tsp of simple syrup is going to contain less sugar than a tsp of pure sugar."
cocktails,3d2k2v,eaglefort91,2,Mon Jul 13 05:52:43 2015 UTC,am I missing something or wouldn't you just want 2 tsp's of simple? I know the extra water will dilute the drink a bit more but wouldn't that be pretty negligible to the average tongue?
cocktails,3d2k2v,PuckDaFackers,3,Mon Jul 13 06:13:23 2015 UTC,"Due to air in the sugar, 1 tsp of sugar and 1 tsp of water add up to being a bit shy of 2 tsp.   At any rate, it's best to make your syrup by weight then do substitutions based on weight too."
cocktails,3d2k2v,OrangeCantRhyme,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:54:58 2015 UTC,"Yes but no. When things dissolve into water they don't simply displace the water. This is evident by the increased density of simple syrup, which we can interpret as more ""stuff"" for a given volume. That said, weight is indeed the best way to be accurate, but I've found 0.25 oz to replace 1 tsp reasonably well. I'm surprised nobody has done a precise measurement of 1:1 simple syrup by weight and calculated this before, maybe I'll just do it at work tomorrow."

Adding their bitters to a cocktail is basically just adding a single flavoring (lemon, cherry, mint, etc), as opposed to classically styled bitters which add a bunch of different complex flavors that don't overpower or announce themselves in a cocktail.  Couple that with the extremely low alcohol content and the huge gap in quality in the ""copycat"" bitters they produce (Aztec Chocolate bitters are nowhere even close to xocolatl mole bitters), and I just don't see how any educated bartender could possibly want to keep them in their bar.

Granted, neither sell that well in our store either but for mint I use mint leaves and for lemon I use actual lemons.  Then, when I need a bitter in a cocktail with lemon juice, I usually bring in a bit of a hopped grapefruit from bittermens or scrappy's grapefruit or a complimenting citrus bitter like Hella bitters as it brings some nice clove notes."

cocktails,3cz9bf,little_fatty,3,Sun Jul 12 03:20:29 2015 UTC,I like a very flavorful classic juniper-forward London Dry. The export strength (47%) Beefeater works well. I found that regular-strength Sipsmith did not hold up well against the other ingredients in the classic equal parts recipe.
cocktails,3cz9bf,wartzilla,2,Sun Jul 12 10:11:35 2015 UTC,"In my own quest for discovery, I've found that American Dry Gin works best for this cocktail. The drink demands an assertive flavor in order to cut through the other hard hitters in this drink. Blue Coat, Junipero, St.George, Cardinal etc... Blue Coat is my pick though. Tanqueray does a good job too if London Dry is more accessible for you."
cocktails,3cz9bf,SLOWchildrenplaying,10,Sun Jul 12 04:28:24 2015 UTC,"You're spot on that assertive gins work well in a Last Word.  I particularly like Junipero and St. George Terroir.  More subdued gins can be overpowered by the Chartreuse, lime, and Maraschino.  While some of its subtleties get lost, I really like the saffron notes that Old Raj brings to the table (when I'm feeling particularly fancy).  However, I'd like to offer a quick correction in terminology:  London Dry Gin is defined by production method rather than location, and I believe that all the gins you mentioned meet the criteria.     London Dry must be distilled after the juniper and other botanicals have been infused (or vapor infused during distillation).  Pretty much, this means that you can't infuse vodka with juniper berries and citrus peel and call it a London Dry Gin.  Gins like that are referred to as Compound Gins.  Hendrick's also doesn't qualify because the cucumber and rose essences are added after the final distillation. Only natural ingredients (I don't recall the definition of natural, but I think it's something like unprocessed botanicals) can be used to flavor Lodon Dry Gin.  No flavor oils. London Dry starts off with a neutral base.  This separates it from Genever (Holland) gin, with starts with a malty whiskey-like base.  Genever is often barrel-aged. London Dry is unsweetened.  This separates it from Old Tom, which is also often barrel-aged. There is a subcategory of gin, most of which qualify as London Dry gins (though some don't, Hendrick's for example) that are sometimes referred to as New Western Dry gins.  Gin is required to have juniper as a dominant flavor.  New Western Dry gins have other flavors that either share the spotlight with Juniper or even rival it for dominance.  St. George Terroir (Alameda, CA) is a great example, with its Doug Fir forward profile.  Aviation (Portland, OR), Venus Spirits Blend No. 1 (Santa Cruz, CA), Hendrick's (Scotland), and G'Vine Floraison (France) are other examples.   I'd call Tanqueray an assertive gin, and I find it's flavor to be most similar to Junipero compared to just about any other gin.  I find recipes that work well with one to work well with the other.  Even Tanqueray isn't made in London, it's produced in Scotland.  There are very few distilleries in London itself.  Up until just a few years ago the only one was Beefeater.  Sipsmith was the first new distillery to open in about a century, and I believe there have been at least a few others since.  Please reply with any corrections if I am in error!"
cocktails,3cz9bf,ems88,2,Sun Jul 12 07:01:38 2015 UTC,I make a variation on the Last Word that replaces Green Chartreuse with Strega called a Bewitched. A less assertive gin like Hendricks shines through better.  1 part Strega 1 part gin 1 part lemon juice  1 part Luxardo  Lemon juice pairs better with Strega than lime juice.

cocktails,3cvpds,xMCioffi1986x,10,Sat Jul 11 04:13:25 2015 UTC,"Before spending up on a fully stocked liquor cabinet, I'd recommend going out to bars and trying a few different cocktails to see where your tastes lie. You can then use the results of that experimentation to inform your shopping list. There's no one-size-fits-all liquor cabinet—some people prefer whiskey-based drinks, others aperitifs, etc. And if you go out and buy up before you know where your tastes lie, you'll end up with some bottles you'll eventually hate or wonder what you were thinking when you picked it up. (Like that UV Salty Watermelon.)  However, if you're after some hard and fast recommendations:   You've got a tonne of hard spirits and not much else—look into picking up some vermouths, fortified wines, or liqueurs to soften these. (If you do buy some vermouth or fortified wine, learn how to treat it—keep it in the fridge at a bare minimum!) For liqueurs, a bottle of Luxardo maraschino will last forever (you usually only add a bar spoon to a cocktail) and it adds a really delicious and unusual flavour. You could also look into picking up some Bénédictine or green Chartreuse—both of these are used in many classic cocktails. You'll need bitters! Angostura at the very least, and if possible an orange bitters (I love both Ango's orange bitters and Regan's no. 6). Peychaud's is used in a handful of classics and no other bitters will do in its place (except for The Bitter Truth's creole bitters which are a Peychaud's knockoff). These are really the only three bitters any home bar needs—the millions of varieties beyond these all have much more limited uses. u/SASColiflowerz has already mentioned a lack of gin. Even one bottle will open your cabinet up to making a bunch of cocktails. For cocktails, go for a classic London dry like Beefeater over a new-style gin like Hendrick's or Gin Mare—you want a team player, and a lot of those fancy new gins like to hog the limelight. You also don't have much in the way of whiskey—one Scotch and one Irish. For mixing, you're better off with American whiskeys, which are used in many more cocktails than either Scotch or Irish whiskey. A bourbon like Buffalo Trace and a rye like Rittenhouse or Old Overholt wouldn't be a bad investment. If you're interested in brandy cocktails, get a cheapish VS or VSOP Cognac. I love Courvoisier's entry level blends for mixing. If you like bitter flavours, investigate the world of Italian amari—start with Aperol (light, bright, not super-bitter), move on to Campari (the classic amaro), and once you've tamed that you can tackle just about anything you like—Montenegro, Lucarno, Ramazotti, etc. Fernet-Branca is like the end boss of Italian amari—it's big and tough and once you've conquered it you know you can tackle anything the booze world throws at you.   Good luck!"
cocktails,3cvpds,chadparkhill,2,Sat Jul 11 07:32:18 2015 UTC,"What an excellent answer. I would just underscore the ""ish"" part of ""cheapish"" when talking about cognacs--the really cheap ones are pretty horrible in my experience."
cocktails,3cvpds,eliason,2,Sat Jul 11 08:39:21 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of good non-cognac brandies at the price point of cheap cognac that are much better, IMO."
cocktails,3cvpds,raevnos,2,Sun Jul 12 08:08:41 2015 UTC,"Depends where you are and what you value in a brandy, I guess. Certainly for very cheap Cognacs it's caveat emptor—there's a lot of shit Cognac out there. And yes, you're likely to get a better value for money brandy if you avoid Cognac and look at other areas. I guess I'm just a sucker for that inimitable Cognac flavour—nothing tastes quite like it."
cocktails,3cvpds,chadparkhill,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:53:00 2015 UTC,"I really wish I could upvote this more. Thank you so much for your input, this is exactly what I was looking for when I made this topic!  It's kind of interesting that you mention the UV...I didn't even spend a dime on the stuff. It was brought over by a friend of my SO's for a get together we had and it didn't go over well. She asked me if I wanted it, and I said yes, why not, it's free? I will likely leave it behind when I finally move out of this place.  I was actually thinking of picking up a bourbon, but wasn't sure about brands. I was reading up on cocktail recipes and tried a whiskey sour with the JW and the Jameson before realizing that they're made with bourbon. The JW was actually quite disgusting for my tastes with lemon flavors but the Jameson wasn't too bad. I've also had Jack and Cokes at bars before and I do like those. I'm not really familiar with Buffalo Trace. What are your opinions on Jim Beam, Jack Daniels, Maker's Mark, Knob Creek? These are brands I'm more familiar with.  Beefeater gin will always remind me of my grandfather, whose drink of choice was always a B&B on the rocks or Beefeater gin on the rocks. I'll look into it."
cocktails,3cvpds,chadparkhill,2,Sat Jul 11 09:06:58 2015 UTC,"Your grandfather sounds like a classy guy!  Re: Bourbon brands, again it depends on your taste and what you like in a bourbon. I like a smooth and well-rounded bourbon with a hint of spice, so my favourite is Woodford Reserve. (Too expensive for everyday drinking though—that's why I suggested Buffalo, which is pretty great for the price.) Maker's and Knob Creek are both fine products too. I personally can't stand any Jim Beam-branded product—too thin and astringent for my tastes—with the exception of their yellow label rye, which is pretty decent and what I'll go for in a pinch if I can't find another brand. (Australia, so not a lot of rye gets over here, and what does is relatively expensive—$70 or so retail for Rittenhouse, for example.) A small pedantic note: Jack Daniel's is actually Tennessee whiskey, not technically bourbon, but it will work wherever bourbon is called for if you like the taste. (I'm not crash-hot on it myself, but I'd take it over Jim Beam white label any day.)  But, as ever, it all comes back to figuring out what you like. Pop over to a bar with a good range of bourbons and sample some. Chat with the bartender if it's quiet. Learning's half the fun."

It's really musky and funky. The St. George High Rye Gin is the closest gin to a genever, at least that I've tried. The High Rye Gin's musky taste is much mellower than a real genever, but it's closer than a London Dry or something. Anyway, you should get your mitts on some genever. It's worth it. Cheers!"

cocktails,3ctvzn,Quinnna,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:25:45 2015 UTC,"Hell I think I have to try this just to see what it tastes like. Never heard of the lychee Soho so I looked it up, apparently it has tasting notes of ""parchment, palm oil, flowers and sealing wax"", but the same reviewer really liked it. If you've tried it, how similar is it to lychee berries themselves? Have to admit that it'd be cheaper to try to infuse some vodka with lychee, or make a lychee syrup than it would be to buy the bottle. Obviously I wouldn't want to screw up the cocktail because I'm being cheap though."
cocktails,3ctvzn,smitty73100,2,Sat Jul 11 02:17:09 2015 UTC,Haha lychee is a love hate flavour but it mixes exceptionally well with those flavours. That cocktail recipe has been one the largest sellers in my bars over the past 8 years. Infusing your own if you have the patience would be a great alternative as well And I'm sure it would taste equally delicious if not better.

cocktails,3cq0o2,hgmanifold,2,Thu Jul 9 21:14:42 2015 UTC,"Pernod in an anise liquor that was created because Absinthe was banned for many years.  Absinthe is anise and wormwood.  Basically at this point Pernod (the anise kind) serves no purpose.  However, absinthe is expensive as hell.    Any of the other absinthe brands are probably fine subs (but they will mostly be just about as expensive) or another absinthe sub (Herbsaint comes to mind)."
cocktails,3cq0o2,EtherCJ,2,Fri Jul 10 03:19:00 2015 UTC,"True, but here are 2 Pernod products available on the liquor store shelf, which is what hgmanifold is referring to. One is the anise liqueur and the other is the more expensive true absinthe product."
cocktails,3cq0o2,kylegwyn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:48:00 2015 UTC,"My point is most of the ""anise liqueur"" on the market that isn't absinthe were pretty much created to skirt the absinthe laws.  A few traditional liqueurs are not in this category like Ouzo, but otherwise I feel like since absinthe isn't illegal anymore might as well get the real thing.  Or at least I would feel that way if absinthe wasn't so insanely pricy."
cocktails,3cq0o2,EtherCJ,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:13:25 2015 UTC,"B) Absinthe'll get you pretty close, though it's not necessarily gonna be more affordable unless you find a mini."
cocktails,3cq0o2,simplecocktails,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:32:42 2015 UTC,"Depending on the recipe, I would suggest Herbsaint as a pastis that is very forgiving, complex and can replace Pernod for cocktail modification.  Specifically, if you are making Tiki or Tropical Exotics, I would suggest using Herbsaint exclusively.  This is, of course, if you have Herbsaint available at your local."
cocktails,3cq0o2,ColonelTiki,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:49:09 2015 UTC,"I just read that. It's a gin based drink but the anise was very prominent. I'm still unsure of the difference between the two kinds of Pernod. If Herbsaint is similar in price to the less expensive kind, I'll just bite the bullet on Pernod. Maybe? Ha."
cocktails,3cq0o2,RyyML,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:53:54 2015 UTC,"Pernod Pastis, the 35 dollar one, is sweeter, thicker, lower abv, and more heavily reliant upon the anise, whereas the 75 dollar absinthe they offer is more or less true, old-timey absinthe, whose hallucination-inducing qualities have been overstated, and also includes wormwood and other botanicals.  If the recipe calls for pernod they probably mean the  cheaper one unless they specifically ask for absinthe."
cocktails,3cq0o2,kylegwyn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:42:33 2015 UTC,"K, so here's my 2 cents. I debated on buying a bottle of absinthe because I had a few cocktails I wanted to use it in. Not particularly because I wanted to drink it straight. And I tried finding a 50ml bottle with no luck, and there weren't any decently reviewed 375ml bottles available at my stores. I ended up buying a full bottle of St. George for about $70. Excellent product. But I have to admit my bottle is still quite full.. I just don't use it often. Typically drinks that call for absinthe call for a rinse which is like the equivalent of a few dashes of bitters.  Unless your drink was primarily absinthe, I would recommend buying the cheaper liqueur. Something like the cheaper Pernod, or Herbsainte. It's typically only used in such small amounts and is more or less just providing that anise essence to your drink. Save that extra $50 for another bottle, or two, of something else."
cocktails,3cq0o2,PeterPanPulse,0,Sat Jul 11 05:58:52 2015 UTC,"What was the cocktail (name/other ingredients besides gin)? Are you attempting to recreate this bartender's cocktail? No matter what, a 'splash', albeit a pointless term, will make it prevalent in the drink. Anymore than a few drops will do that(the small amounts used in some Tiki drinks are generally there to lengthen the drink and add that 'potion' element).   What's the difference? Pernod Superior ($75), as of 2013, is made with the original recipe as the Pernod absinthe that rose to fame in the early 20th century. Pernod anise ($35) does not contain the additional herbs (e.g. wormwood, etc.) and has additional sweeteners. Superior is 136-proof while the Anise is 80-proof.   Difference in flavor: Anise is much sweeter and bright, viscous, almost oily, and should never be served as traditional absinthe or used in larger quantities in a recipe calling for a lot of absinthe; it will do for a spritz or to bring out solely anise notes, but that's all it has going for it. The Pernod Superior is thinner, packs more heat, develops quite a beautiful louche, and is much more aromatic, vegetal and complex.   Substitutes: I highly recommend Herbsaint (a rearrangement of the letters in 'absinther') or St. George's Absinthe (not cutting out the price point here though), or a decent anisette (Meletti). It just depends on the application. Also, think of it this way: If this is just to make drinks at home, why not make a one-time investment on something of good quality? The bottle could last you years. Big deal."

""The Farmer's Daughter"" - Spilanthes infused gin, fresh lime, simple syrup and a splash of Pernod.   Are you attempting to recreate this bartender's cocktail?    Yep. It was effing delicious and I'd love to play around with it a bit and since I may be moving, I won't have the opportunity to visit and have one there! :(  As the cocktail had a really unique flavor it was a bit difficult to really assign the flavors. - I should note: I'm not a huge drinker and usually stick to Tom Collins/G&T's so my palette isn't great and I'm not really qualified to ""map"" the flavors to the different ingredients. - It smelled more like anise than tasted... so I think I could sufficiently replicate it with the standard Pernod, based on your amazing breakdown.   Thank you so much for your reply.    Also, think of it this way: If this is just to make drinks at home, why not make a one-time investment on something of good quality?

For anyone in recovery reading this there's going to be a very small amount of alcohol present and it's not strictly non-alcoholic. I've heard of relapses from people not realizing the presence of small amounts. Same goes for cooking with beer etc, cooking doesn't entirely remove alcohol content.

My guess is that you can probably keep the falernum for a month or two, probably even longer if stored in the fridge."

cocktails,3cmog3,jayeedoubleeff,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:19:52 2015 UTC,Sounds about right.  I work at a bar with a heavy rhum agricole selection and we did some side-by-side comparisons between agricole and cachaça.  You should definitely be able to find something that approximates the flavor.
cocktails,3cmog3,overtOVR,2,Thu Jul 9 17:15:29 2015 UTC,"Death & Co. makes their mai tai with demerara rum (along with jamaican) and only uses a small amount of rhum in their mai tai.

cocktails,3cmog3,bitcheslovebanjos,2,Thu Jul 9 05:18:07 2015 UTC,"The black Jamaican is rich, and the gold is strong, both have high esters, so they're more funky then Smith & Cross.

cocktails,3cmog3,jotaylor,2,Thu Jul 9 15:29:49 2015 UTC,"The barbencourt (available at the lcbo) can be substituted for agricole, as it's made in a similar fashion, though you might not like the rubbery flavour it brings (which I actually like).   I've been experimenting recently though due to my dwindling supply of clement vsop (thanks to my brother in Calgary), and though some might find it sacrilegious, I've had surprisingly great results subbing in a nice sweet aged Cuban-style rum for the agricole (like Flor de Cana 5yr), while keeping the funk factor alive with appletons. I find most people really can't tell the difference due to all the other strong flavours in the drink.   Basically my advice is don't worry too much, experiment, and if all else fails plan a trip to montreal and pick up some real agricole!"

cocktails,3clyj4,trippca,11,Wed Jul 8 23:04:03 2015 UTC,"Do Trader Vic's and you won't need falernum or grapefruit juice. IMO all you need is the 2 rums, lime, Cointreau, orgeat, simple syrup. In terms of rum, a safe choice is a rhum agricole and dark Jamaican, Rhum Clement VSOP and Appleton Extra being great choices. You can switch out the dark Jamaican for something funkier like Smith & Cross, or something smoky like El Dorado 8 (or 12/15).   As for batching, I wouldn't do it a day in advance, the sharpness of lime juice will probably dull if mixed with all the other ingredients and left to sit. You could probably get away with doing it in the morning/afternoon. All it would take is pouring together 4 ingredients and juicing limes so unless you're expecting a huge crowd, it shouldn't take that long.  PS it is ""Mai Tai"" or Maita'i if you want to get technical, but it is not Thai."

cocktails,3clyj4,kylegwyn,2,Thu Jul 9 04:36:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, so liquid ingredients aside, what's your plan for ice? It really makes the drink to have crushed or pellet ice. Do you happen to have a Sonic drive in nearby? You can order bags of ice for like $2.25 or something. Pretty worth it to pick up a few bags. Everybody loves the pellet ice, and it makes for an improved tiki drink presentation.  Did you find a good orgeat, or are you planning to make it? BG Reynolds makes a good one, but I've only seen it in a few stores nearby (it's made here in Portland, so might be more local) but I think you can buy it on amazon. They also make a falernum for your DB version. I haven't tried it, or the DB Maitai, but I'm sure the syrup is authentic if you can pick some up.  The recipe on the bottle of orgeat call for •¾ oz B.G. Reynolds’ Original Orgeat  •1½ oz dark rum •½ oz Orange Curaçao •½ oz Wray and Nephew •¾ oz fresh lime juice •1 lime shell  I often use either 2 oz of Appleton VX or 1:1 Appleton and Barbancourt. And Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao. And a mint sprig!  For batching, you could just look at each measurement as a cup rather than an ounce (for instance, instead of ¾ oz, do ¾ of a cup.)  Lastly, it may interest you, I found this video a while back for making the (updated) classic 1944 TV Mai Tai."
cocktails,3clyj4,likelydrunk,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:14:06 2015 UTC,"So, re: Batching  I could literally combine everything that morning (even the booze) and then just instruct people to pour, shake and strain over crushed ice?

Re: ice   We rented out a hotel with a kitchen, so I am banking on them having an industrial sized ice maker. as for crushing, maybe a lewis bag the size of a potato sack and a sledge?"
cocktails,3clyj4,cocktails13,2,Fri Jul 10 12:34:32 2015 UTC,"Last summer I made it my goal to get (somewhat) competent at making Tiki drinks. I've made a bunch of different recipes. Here's, IMO, the real Mai Tai:   1 oz. fresh lime juice 1/2 oz. Orange Curacao 1/4 oz. Orgeat Syrup 1/4 oz. Simple Syrup 1 oz. dark Jamaican rum 1 oz. aged Martinique rum.   Shake together, add one half of the spent lime shell, slap some mint and throw it on top.  I think you could bath all of this together, although I would highly recommend not adding the lime juice the night before. I think it'll tarnish the flavor and you'll end up with something tasting a bit funky. Everything else though, you can mix together the night before. Great idea from kylegwyn about the Sonic ice...definitely makes a difference! For the lime juice, I'd press the day of, and maybe measure out 1oz into small disposable plastic cups or something. That way people can pour in (roughly) the amount into their glasses, and then they add a shot of lime juice, the shell, and the mint.  Also wonderful idea from hebug about using the El Dorado. Great suggestion. Maybe have a few types of rum and allow people to mix in the lime and rum together? But have all the other syrups and curacao pre-mixed. Depends on how much customization you want to allow for.  Hope some of that helps! Sounds like a great party! You should think about ordering some of those little umbrellas off of Amazon..."

cocktails,3cizuq,eNonsense,2,Thu Jul 9 04:54:13 2015 UTC,"That's a great start since it's a very simple drink. Just bourbon, sugar & lemon juice (people often add an egg white for texture). Don't use sour mix and fresh lemon juice is preferable. I also prefer a reaming juicer rather than the hand press that people more frequently use in a bar. If you go that route you'll probably want to double strain through something like this though.  A variation of the whiskey sour that I really like is the Frisco. You're swapping out the sugar for a 1/2 oz of Benedictine, which is a liqueur that I think kind-of tastes like spiced honey (Benedictine is popular in this sub). Most people use Rye with this drink rather than Bourbon but you can use either. I do recommend buying a bottle of Rittenhouse Rye though."

At first I just focussed on technique and proportions, then once you develop a palate for how you like your ice, how sweet you like it etc. you can start exploring different base liquors and experimenting with modifiers.   Soon enough you'll learn that if you swap out your base liquor and tweak some other basics you've got a whole new cocktail! It's only a hop-skip and a jump from the Whiskey Sour to the Margarita. The trick is giving your palate enough time (months) to really develop a taste for subtle experiments. Good luck!"

For glassware, have coupes, rocks glasses, collins glasses, and maybe snifters.  I second the buy-as-you-go approach for liquors, and be careful with perishables like vermouth.

From the small amount I've read, Aquavit is a Scandinavian liquor with caraway or dill as the main herbal flavor, while Sambuca is Italian and anise-flavored. Might not be a dead ringer, but I feel like Sambuca is probably pretty close."
cocktails,3ch1he,mcleif,3,Tue Jul 7 21:47:41 2015 UTC,"I would consider Sambuca and Aquavit very different from each other. Aquavit is a spiced vodka most commonly spiced with fennel, anise and citrus flavors. Aquavit is often used as a dram at a Swedish tradition called midsummer.  But back to the taste, I personally would not recommend that you switch out Aquavit for Sambuca. If you can not get your hands on any aquavit you should instead try to infuse vodka with flavors like dill, anise, fennel, coriander and cardamom."

I've been experimenting with cutting the sugar in my grenadine and adding other flavours such as orange peel and cinnamon into the recipe.   doing this requires using a bit more grenadine per drink to get the sweetness balanced properly. but this works great in a cocktail like a tequila sunrise because you get more grenadine flavour in the final drink without over-sweetening.

It sounds crazy, but it works fine. (you want to end up with about a cup of juice). Clean an orange. Peel off 3 or 4 long thin pieces of zest and put them in the juice. Heat the juice up over low heat on the stove. Do not boil it! Stir in about 1 cup of sugar. Stir in about an ounce of pomegranate molasses.

cocktails,3cfpf1,culb77,2,Tue Jul 7 18:31:25 2015 UTC,"Short answer: It's not going to spoil, but it might change flavour.  Long answer:  If energy gets into a mixture of substances, molecules will absorb this energy and move about a bit. Some molecules that are not very heavy will evaporate out of the mixture. These are ""light"" ""top note"" flavours disappearing. Sometimes, enough energy will get into two molecules that they might react with each other and form a new molecule. Or, a molecule might be unstable and split into other molecules which are also unstable and in turn form into other new molecules. It's one great big chemical clusterfuck.  So things in your mixture WILL change over time. The alcohol will stop some nasty little organisms getting in there and changing it at a relatively fast rate, but it can't stop slow-ass reactions. The answer to your specific question just depends how much time those reactions actually take. There is a reason some liquids say ""Keep refrigerated"" on their packages and others only say ""Store in a cool, dark place away from sunlight."" Some things need not only to be in a dark box, but also to have all the surrounding heat energy sucked out of the environment.  To cut this story short, I don't believe you need to keep your infusions refrigerated. The chemical change that will happen first to your liquids is that you'll lose those ""top notes"", and you're probably doing a good job of stopping most of the evaporation by keeping a lid on the bottle. You might lose a little of the top notes through chemical reaction but that shit is going to take a long time.  What you definitely should do is keep some in your cabinet and some in your fridge, and taste them side by side every time you go for a drink of one. That will tell you how much the flavour changes with the difference in temperature and ambient light. You might like the refrigerated one more. Maybe you won't. But you'll know."

Sorry to all if this is bad form, but I'll throw in a follow-up question:  Homemade liqueurs, consisting of fruit-infused liquor, sugar and water.

cocktails,3cfpf1,MedullaOblongAwesome,4,Tue Jul 7 17:10:52 2015 UTC,"Not true. Alcohol is a preservative, it'll actively prevent decay. You're actually supposed to keep spirits somewhere warm during infusion, as lower temperatures mean a longer infusion time."

The argument for using certain infusions quickly is that certain flavour compounds are chemically fragile enough that alcohol would break them down making the drink taste ""off"". Not the same thing as decay, though."

cocktails,3cf0di,sarahmedlin,11,Tue Jul 7 12:00:33 2015 UTC,"The pith gives more structure, so your twist holds its shape better. The bitterness of the pith is only really a concern if you're making oleo saccharum or other kitchen applications, it won't have the time to be released in a cocktail.  Use a speed peeler and you tend to get a good amount of pith without cutting through to the flesh."
cocktails,3cf0di,JimmySinner,6,Tue Jul 7 13:03:53 2015 UTC,Structure is the key here. I find a bit of pith also allows you to get a nice 'snap' when expressing a peel over a drink.
cocktails,3cf0di,IanHoolihan,3,Tue Jul 7 13:46:13 2015 UTC,"I've found that to be the case as well. I personally try to minimize the amount of pith I get, but it can definitely be challenging.   If there is a vein (?) of pith, I do find it helps a lot with expressing oils, especially for a flamed twist. However, I typically do not drop a twist w/ significant pith into a drink, as I believe it adds to bitterness as it steeps.   If I get a twist with minimal pith, I have no qualms about dropping it into the drink after expressing, as a fair amount of the oil ends up coming out on the back side of the peel."
cocktails,3cf0di,hebug,3,Wed Jul 8 03:24:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean. If I'm flaming oils over a drink I just use a knife to cut a thicker round piece about the size of a £2 coin (I think a dollar coin is a comparable size?) and discard it after rimming the glass. The extra pith helps with squeezing a lot of oil out in one motion over a flame.  For twists I've used a speed peelers for the past 10 years and other than the occasional batch of shit lemons or a grapefruit that's past its best I think they give enough pith.  I do use an actual zesting knife when I need a nice thin spiral (twisted over a straw, then slid off the straw into the glass). It looks great in a flute. A zesting knife won't give you any pith whatsoever but they express loads of oil while cutting. Citrus oils destroy foams instantly so you can't use them to cut the zest directly over a glass, but if you want plenty of citrus flavour in a Martini or another drink served up with a lot of surface area, they're an excellent choice.  Also I totally nerded out when I saw that hebug replied to my post! You're an invaluable resource here my friend."
cocktails,3cf0di,JimmySinner,5,Wed Jul 8 03:59:54 2015 UTC,"I have not noticed any added bitterness. But I also don't notice it if/when I muddle the crap out of mint. So either my palate is off, or these are just urban legends."
cocktails,3cf0di,peterlcole,2,Tue Jul 7 12:27:10 2015 UTC,I tried the mint thing after reading a Mojito writeup here (maybe it was you). Didn't taste any difference either. The only reason I gently muddle my Mojito mint is to prevent having tiny bits of leaf-mosh in the glass.
cocktails,3cf0di,MONDARIZ,3,Tue Jul 7 13:25:43 2015 UTC,You can clearly taste it if you take one or two mint leaves and start chewing on them. First you find the good mint taste you know from the mojito but then it changes to a more bitter (and plain bad) taste. This is an extreme example of what happens if you grind your mint to a stew in a mojito but it can definitely change the taste of the drink as well.
cocktails,3cgv3q,euthanatos,2,Tue Jul 7 20:27:04 2015 UTC,"Hi! Long-time lurker, first-time poster here.  tl;dr: It's delicious as heck and absolutely worth a try.  Longer version: I came across Casa Mariol vermut negre on a design blog just before I was about to go on a trip to Spain and was really struck by the bottle design, so I made a mental note to try some while I was in Barcelona. Went out to the Mariol shopfront near La Sagrada Família to sample it and basically had my mind blown by how good it was. (The huge pour size helped!) When I got back home to Melbourne, Australia, I found out that a local importer had just picked it up, and around the same time I was offered a job at a bar an acquaintance of mine was starting up. I suggested Casa Mariol to the managers and after trying some they put it in as their house vermouth (one of three sweet vermouths we stock). We now sell tonnes of the stuff, apparently more than any other venue in Australia, so I'm pretty intimately familiar with it.  I've sampled a lot of different vermouths, but I can't think of any other sweet vermouth I'd rather drink on its own. It's really delicious: a nice mild bitterness, loads of Christmas spice character, not overly sweet, a nice bright acidity on the palate that a lot of other sweet vermouths lack. Serve on the rocks with an orange wedge and some olives as a garnish, plus a dash of soda water. Perfection.  The only thing is that the qualities that make it so good on its own also mean it's not always great in cocktails. For example, a simple Negroni (1:1:1 with Beefeater and Campari) tastes pretty awful—something about the acidity of the vermut clashing with the Campari, I think. (An Americano with Casa Mariol and Campari also didn't taste great.) For this reason we stick to another vermouth, more of a team player, when making cocktails at our bar. But it could be excellent in other mixed drinks—you'd just have to get a bottle and experiment with things like Manhattans, Rob Roys, etc."
cocktails,3cgv3q,chadparkhill,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:28:51 2015 UTC,"Very cool; I'll definitely give it a try. I'm sad to hear that it doesn't work well in a negroni, but I guess I can pick up a bottle of something cheaper for mixing as well.  Thanks for the info!"

Make sure it's dark colored fabric or, if you're going with leather, make sure that you read up on leather care and treatment.  If you're working in a bar that does any kind of volume, the leather's gonna get covered in a variety of acidic and sticky ingredients that are probably going to stain it.  Yeah, come to think of it, leather apron is a bad call.  Stick with a dark cloth one that you can easily throw in the wash."

cocktails,3cadtz,hebug,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:11:52 2015 UTC,"I remember reading an article about cocktails in Taipei a while ago, but the best I could find today is this video of a cocktail using Kaoliang from Fourplay link. No measurements, but it looks kind of wild pairing it with absinthe, vanilla liqueur, honey and lemon. I would love to learn more about cocktails using Kaoliang, I'm sure it'd be a huge hit with my parents. Maybe your best bet is to go to one of the better cocktail dens in Taipei and ask for their recommendation."
cocktails,3cadtz,hebug,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:09:09 2015 UTC,"So I have never tried baiju so I can't exactly say how similar their tastes are but kaoliang is made from sorghum which is in the same family as sugar cane, so maybe it is more similar to cachaça than baiju. (Taiwanese caipirinha ;D)  Kaoliang is really sweet which allows it to be enjoyed straight despite being nearly 120 proof. It is also made at 38% abv which I think would be much easier to stomach straight (though I have yet to try it), but the 58% is more popular.   I am definitely going to experiment with it, so I'll let you know the result haha."

cocktails,3ccgty,MissSteakVegetarian,5,Mon Jul 6 20:54:29 2015 UTC,"There are some nice cocktails that you could use with Curaçao.  One from the 1950s is the Leatherneck Cocktail.    2 oz. Whiskey .75 oz. Blue Curaçao .5 oz. Lime Juice Garnish Lime Wheel   Shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with the Lime wheel.   Another interesting one was created by the famed Japanese bartender Kazuo Uyeda in 1995. He frequently used Blue Curaçao to affect the color palette for his creations. This one is called a Sumidagawa Boshoku.   1 oz. Vodka 1 oz. Sake  1 oz. Rosé Vermouth (I'm sure sweet vermouth would work) 1/2 tsp. Blue Curaçao   Stir with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.   Lastly I'm recommending the Blue Reef which is a Tiki drink created by Jeff ""Beach Bum"" Berry.    2 oz. Light Puerto Rican Rum .5 oz. Galliano 1.5 oz. Blue Curaçao 1.5 oz. Lime Juice   Shake with ice in a mixing glass and strain into a snifter or double rocks glass filled with crushed ice.   I don't have much for the Watermelon Pucker unfortunately, but you can also use the Blue Curaçao in any recipes that call for regular Orange Curaçao. Hope you enjoy some of these!"

China Blue   0.75 oz curacao 2 oz lychee liqueur (Soho is popular) 4 oz grapefruit juice   Shake together and strain into a highball with ice, or one of those really tall triangle ones (name escapes me).

cocktails,3ccgty,sixner,-1,Tue Jul 7 02:28:14 2015 UTC,"The idea is good, but the execution lacks finesse.   Personally, I think highly recommending OP to upgrade their ingredients is a good thing. I get that everyone starts somewhere, and most people don't have money to blow on a bottle of Cointreau. The issue is your drink is only as good as your worst ingredient. If OP is just mixing evan williams with watermelon pucker, then whatever. If Op is mixing watermelon pucker with a nice single barrel, then it's really tainting a quality spirit.   I guess moral of my point is it's good to push people to up the ante, we just don't have to be a dick while doing it."

I also chose the recipes to post that I did because many well respected bartenders/authors have used Blue Curaçao as a legit ingredient.

Another answer:  You can't copyright a recipe (as covered recently on this sub) so it's all just a Wild West frontier of cocktail creativity. Including names.  If you use those ingredients at home, in proportions that make you happy, you can name it any damn thing you like!

cocktails,3c6n14,an8hu,9,Sun Jul 5 09:46:49 2015 UTC,"Beautiful. I love finding ""exotic"" ingredients for cocktails.   What fruit has the closest taste to Jamun?"
cocktails,3c6n14,ajcfood,5,Sun Jul 5 12:00:20 2015 UTC,"How to describe its taste... It has acid in it so the flavor profile has  astringency, you'll get that on the first bite which gives way to the sweetness of it. Its not overly sweet and its taste linger in your mouth long after you have eaten it. Can't think of any fruit for comparison."
cocktails,3c6n14,highbrowalcoholic,7,Sun Jul 5 13:33:33 2015 UTC,Acid doesn't cause astringency. Polyphenols caused astringency. Is the jamun sour and acidic like lemon juice? Or does it dry the mouth out like a cup of black tea?
cocktails,3c6n14,highbrowalcoholic,3,Sun Jul 5 14:45:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah my mistake, its both acidic(as in sour grapes)and astringent(as in mouth-feel after cup of strong black tea). Looked it up its full of tannin."
cocktails,3c6n14,highbrowalcoholic,10,Sun Jul 5 14:58:25 2015 UTC,"Cool! I did a bit of bullshit armchair chemistry and found a research paper called Volatile flavour components of jamun fruit.  The abstract says that the major compounds are two variants of the Ocimene (Tropical, green, terpy and woody with vegetable nuances), Myrcene (Terpy, herbaceous, woody with a rosy celery and carrot nuance, vegetative, citrus, fruity with a tropical mango and slight leafy minty nuances), and α-terpineol (pine terpene lilac citrus woody floral). These compounds are tepenes, which in general are the green/piney/beanstalk/grass flavours, loads of volatile top notes to the palate. The characteristic flavour of Jamun is from the compounds dihydrocarvyl acetate (Floral, green, fruity, vegetative, camphoreous and piney with bean nuance), geranyl butyrate (Sweet, fresh fruity, waxy, raspberry, peach, apricot, tropical notes with a green nuance), and terpinyl valerate (fruity floral).  So, lots of top notes, predominantly green and floral moving into light fruit. This explains why I've read Jamun to be described as a ""delicate"" flavour underneath all that green astringency and sourness.  What if you add some milk? Or puree then strain it into a coulis, add milk, let it curdle, and then strain out the solids again in some sore of crude milk-wash? You might be able to get the astringency out of it and use it as a sour element.  Again, this sounds easy from the comfort of my Sunday off."
cocktails,3c6n14,Slapthatbass84,2,Sun Jul 5 15:23:08 2015 UTC,"Wow mate I'm floored, will read up on it and try it on my day off, but won't the curdled liquid have after taste to it, what it all being whey and full of proteins."
cocktails,3c6n14,gorbachev,8,Sun Jul 5 15:30:58 2015 UTC,"When you curdle milk in an astringent liquid, the tannins that cause the astringency connect with the proteins in the milk. These clump up and cause the curdling.  After straining the curdled liquid away, you're left with a mixture of the leftovers from the milk -- the fat and lactose sugar plus a little bit of other things -- and whatever your original liquid was, minus its polyphenols.  I'm actually not sure how acidic the final product might be. It may be that the acid from the jamun juice also cause the milk to curdle, and so the acidity is diminished.  At the very least, in theory, if you ""milk-wash"" (strain, add milk, let curdle, strain again) Jamun juice, you ought to diminish the ""green""ness, leaving more the delicate fruity floral notes, and have a subtley creamy-sweetness added to it.  Also you can stick ""milk-washed Jamun juice"" on a cocktail menu and some bartender somewhere will probably get a raging hard-on."

cocktails,3c4qcj,thewombbroom,2,Sun Jul 5 00:04:57 2015 UTC,its actually not red bull.  its a SE Asian red bull knock off called M-150.  its actually more potent and way cheaper.
cocktails,3c4qcj,mewchantwo,6,Sun Jul 5 04:14:22 2015 UTC,"Actually it's not the knock-off it's actually the original formula. It wasn't until Dietrich came over, bought the formula and redid to suit western tastes more that it became the red bull we all know and love today.  I think part of the deal Dietrich made with the original that inventor was that he gets 1c  of every red bull can sold. So he must be richer than the entire GDP of Thailand by now haha.  Source: vaguely remember what the red bull rep was saying when he came over."

cocktails,3c67nu,bitcheslovebanjos,3,Sun Jul 5 05:28:51 2015 UTC,"Went to Calgary, Alberta recently and found this. I have never seen it in the States, so I had to pick up a bottle when I happened across it.   Lochan Ora is a Scotch based honey liqueur, with less sweetness and more smoke than Drambuie. It's flavor is more delicate. So where I usually like a rusty nail:   2 oz Scotch 3/4 oz Drambuie 1 barspoon Islay Scotch (Laphroaig)   I found the Lochan Ora to be a less assertive flavor than Drambuie and worked better as   2 oz Scotch 1 oz Lochan Ora 1 barspoon Islay Scotch (Laphroaig)   Overall I feel the Lochan Ora is a great substitue and creates a less sweet, more complex Rusty Nail. It almost has a medicinal taste, but in the best way possible, and a slight lingering peated finish.   Here is a good article comparing Drambuie and Lochan Ora.   A rusty nail is a great simple classic cocktail that is really only remembered by old timers, and hasn't quite found the love of cocktail resurgence i think it deserves. Try one out with Drambuie or Lochan Ora if you are lucky enough to get a hold of some.   Man I really should have done a NCotW on the Rusty Nail."

cocktails,3c6egk,randomacc435,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:12:21 2015 UTC,"Hi, fellow Norwegian here. I feel your frustration. I think your best bet is to get a neutral spirit under 22 % like Kalinka 22 (21.9%) from Vinmonopolet and try to substitute this for rum in a mojito recipe. It is probably the closest you can get without 'breaking the law'. It definitely won't be the same tough, but probably drinkable."
cocktails,3c6egk,cyanboy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:47:04 2015 UTC,"Mojito allows for a lot variations, like a margarita or daiquiri. So I'm not worried about the cactus blossom thing, even though I don't have any idea how it could taste like.   However, what makes a mojito a mojito is muddling your lime and mint (or even another kind of herb)  in the glass using sugar as an abrasive. As soon as you use pre-made simple syrup and/or lime juice, it's nothing more than a daiquiri with mint in a long glass.   I understand your issue but if I were you, I'd rather find someone who can make the purchase for me and use the real deal instead. It'll make a hell of a difference."
cocktails,3c6egk,Asshai,2,Sun Jul 5 08:36:14 2015 UTC,"ehh - as soon as you dont use fucking rum its not a mojito. And never muddle mint, it turns it bitter. Treat it gently and it will treat you gently. And rather use simple syrup than give me a mojito with undissoweld sugar in it, i find it dissgusting."
cocktails,3c6bia,kamakaro,3,Sun Jul 5 06:25:44 2015 UTC,"Like you, I find the standard serving of Maraschino to be way too much. Just like yellow chartreuse, it's something I'm having trouble wrapping my taste buds around. The Last Word, for me, is an OK cocktail. An interesting sub is to use Fernet as opposed to Gin. That completely changes the drink."

cocktails,3c6bia,highbrowalcoholic,2,Mon Jul 6 02:31:54 2015 UTC,"The Chartreuse Swizzle is a strong start. Difford's Recipe looks pretty good, I haven't made one in a while.  Bijous are Gin, Sweet Vermouth and Chartreuse, originally in equal parts, and a dash of orange bitters. I don't like equal parts, I think it's incredibly unbalanced. Try 6:2:1 or if you need more Chartreuse, 3:1:1, and start out with something bitter for the vermouth like Carpano Classico or Punt e Mes to balance the sweetness."

cocktails,3c6bia,Westcoastbiased,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:40:09 2015 UTC,"Don't apologise. Punt e Mes is just another brand of vermouth, like Martini is. Martini is quite bitter itself, very thyme-ey, strong herbal notes. Punt e Mes has deeper dark fruit and wine notes, and has a strong round bitterness to it. If you like Martini vermouth but think, ""man, I want something with body that slaps me in the face,"" grab a bottle of Punt e Mes."

cocktails,3c66he,321wfsn,6,Sun Jul 5 05:12:35 2015 UTC,Just make a simple syrup. The sugar is not going to dissolve without a decent amount of agitation/stirring.

cocktails,3c66he,CWinthrop,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:32:37 2015 UTC,Yup. Buy or make simple syrup. The only thing I use granulated sugar for is making sugar rims :)
cocktails,3c66he,UnripeCocktailMachin,2,Sun Jul 5 10:26:12 2015 UTC,"Hmm, what's your exact method?  Usually I douse a cube in aromatic bitters and water, muddle it down until it forms a paste, then add the spirit.   If you're having issues with that method, simple syrup will yield the same drink."
cocktails,3c66he,Kittykathax,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:19:25 2015 UTC,"I measured out the sugar, then added the bitters (varying amounts as I've been trying to get this to work for a while now) and made it into a paste. After that, I added the bourbon and wound up with a layer of sugar at the bottom. Looks like I'm going the simple syrup route."
cocktails,3c66he,AdmiralMoonshine,3,Sun Jul 5 05:31:53 2015 UTC,Water?  You gotta add a splash of water with the bitters.
cocktails,3c66he,Kittykathax,2,Sun Jul 5 06:01:10 2015 UTC,"Do you stir it after you've added the bourbon? I know that seems like a stupid question, but sometimes I'll make the paste with a little less water, add the bourbon and ice, stir it to dilute, then strain into a proper glass."

cocktails,3c66he,red-gloved-rider,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:51:55 2015 UTC,"It's easy. Dissolve the sugar first. When alcohol is added (bitters are alcohol), it doesn't allow for the complete blending of sugar and water. Dissolve first, then add bitters."

cocktails,3c66he,Nosterana,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:48:38 2015 UTC,"Minor detail, but 1/4 ounce of 1:1 simple syrup contains the 1 teaspoon of sugar that a sugar cube has."
cocktails,3c66he,Scrofuloid,3,Sun Jul 5 16:12:55 2015 UTC,"1 cl of simple syrup contains around 6 grams of sugar and 6 grams of water. 1/4 oz is .75 cl, which is 4.5g of sugar. Sugar, depending on granularity, usually clocks in on 9g/cl, which would mean a teaspoon of .5cl weighs 4.5g. Math checks out!"
cocktails,3c66he,cookmundo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:37:38 2015 UTC,"Based on some Googling, a sugar cube weights 3-4g. For example, the brand I usually see in the US (C&H) has 3.6g sugar cubes. 0.25oz of syrup will likely be a little sweeter than one cube of sugar, depending on exactly how you make your syrup. I think a teaspoon is the right ballpark for 1:1 simple syrup in an Old Fashioned or similar drink -- but I like mine a little on the dry side."
cocktails,3c66he,kylegwyn,2,Mon Jul 6 01:13:29 2015 UTC,"I was using considerably lower-level math where 1 part of sugar with 1 part water yields 1.5 parts simple, so  reverse equation 1.5 teaspoons (1/4 ounce) has 1 teaspoon sugar. I was using Texas Imperial 4g cubes but you're right Old Fashioneds are good with just a teaspoon of simple."

I work at a local distillery, we just opened up and the only spirits we are allowed to serve are the ones we produce. For the past couple of months its just been vodka, we launch our white whiskey today though(Yay!). Having only type of spirit has forced us to get creative, even breaking some norms in cocktail culture. I have serveral drinks on our menu that I'm proud of and get frequent postive feedback from, and I will share one with you random stranger from the internet.   I call it 'HoneyHUE Vojito' (HUE is the name of our vodka and its a Vojito because we use vodka whereas a traditional Mojito would use rum). Its a refreshing cocktail that features honeydew, mango, and mint.   To make it you'll need a shaker and a highball glass. In the shaker glass muddle 2oz of Honeydew puree(or 4-5 nice chunks of melon if youd rather not make a puree) and 4 mint leafs. Add 2oz of mango juice, 1.5oz Vodka and ice to shaker. Shake and strain (I double strain but you dont have to) into a highball with ice. Garnish with a mint leaf and a thin slice of honeydew.   Serve with a smile."

I would add at least a half cup per 5 gallons of whatever spirit, whiskey, gin, or whatever higher proof stuff will be in your to the barrel to kill everything... Bung it roll it around a couple times over the next day.  Whenever you are ready to barrel age your next, take the bung out and you're ready to age again.  Remember, you will still have some residual flavor from the Negroni.  (Barrel aged negronis are so good!)   I guess a rule of thumb would be to leave alcohol in the barrel, it will keep it moist and less likely to fall apart and it will keep it sterile.  That work?  Good luck!"

cocktails,3bzio6,p0dde,16,Fri Jul 3 12:21:22 2015 UTC,"The reason that bourbon overtook brandy was that cognac became too expensive due to the grapes being killed off from disease. So, going back to cognac is a fine thing to do - I definitely prefer it with cognac. For a good history, see http://www.drinkingcup.net/sazerac-cocktail-truth-behind-nola-favourite-drink/  For bitters, it should classically be peychauds and I see no reason to change - it's great that way. One of the key variances I see is in what to do with the absinthe. At Milk & Honey (the New York branch, when it was at flatiron), they used to rinse with absinthe and then give you a shot glass of the remains on the side. I've seen a couple of places just use atomisers to give that hint of absinthe. I'm not a fan of absinthe, however it's absolutely necessary in this drink. So atomisers or just throwing it away works for me :).   Find a brandy that you like and just go with it."

cocktails,3bxxsy,chrisjdgrady,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:24:16 2015 UTC,I don't know. I like the walnut for whiskey cocktails and the grapefruit for a death in Venice. Different folks etc.
cocktails,3bxxsy,debussi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:58:06 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I have the walnut and it is pretty good here and there. They just lack depth and ... bitterness?
cocktails,3bxxsy,kosmo_theoros,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:01:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, they don't have a lot of actually 'bitterness' and don't have a ton of depth as they're half the price (or less) compared to other small batch bitters.  However, they sell much faster and in much higher volume than other bitters (taken from my own experience as an online bitter retailer). More bars use them than any others from my experience. Best craft bars? No, but ...at the same time, if a bar uses Rhubarb bitters from Fee vs. just making instant margarita's with crappy Jose Cuervo Gold, I'm not gonna trash 'em! At least they stepped up their game."
cocktails,3bxxsy,everydaydrinkers,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:15:52 2015 UTC,"the only bitters that compare in volume would be Regan's and maybe Peychaud's.

cocktails,3by7ny,kaiser_xc,4,Fri Jul 3 07:23:41 2015 UTC,"Bartending is a field where Bro Science dominated for a long time.  The internet is slowly changing that.   The amount of retarded shit I heard on just ""ice"" ... but then articles such as this one finally put all the nonsense to rest.  There's still some of that crap floating around but the geeks have taken over.  Alcohol doesn't burn sugar.  But. Sugar doesn't dissolve well in alcohol. Which is why you should use syrup rather than granulated sugar or sugar cube in an old fashioned. I mean you can use granulated sugar; but at best you'll achieve the same exact result as with syrup [but with ridiculously more labor and wasted time], at worst you'll have a drink with granulated sugar floating around."
cocktails,3by7ny,mambouli,-1,Fri Jul 3 13:42:04 2015 UTC,I know. And I hated people who get caught up in the process. If I can make a drink just as well wine twice as fast I don't care how it was originally done.
cocktails,3by7ny,kaiser_xc,3,Fri Jul 3 14:00:35 2015 UTC,"Well I wouldn't go so far as to dismiss how drinks were originally done.  But dissolving a cube of sugar in an old fashioned was probably done because all bars didn't carry syrup. So you'd make your instant syrup by dissolving the sugar in water and then creating your drink on top of that.  But yeah, if you achieve identical result but faster and with more consistency; by all means."
cocktails,3by7ny,mambouli,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:48:14 2015 UTC,Yeah. Certainly some methods are there for a reason but others are antiquated. Also since we are having this discussion what do you think about not muddling mojitos and instead just shaking the mint with ice to get the flavouring. Personally I think it tastes the same and cuts down on time quite a bit.
cocktails,3by7ny,kaiser_xc,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"Well I think you have to muddle the lime anyways, so just throw the mint in at the bottom with syrup and lightly tap it to release fragrance without shredding the leaves. Then put in your lime and muddle a bit.   Then rhum. Then shake. Then top with soda."
cocktails,3by7ny,mambouli,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:41:37 2015 UTC,I like to put the mint in first so that the like acts as w buffer. Although if you're just using lime juice you can just shake it and let the ice bruise the mint for you.
cocktails,3by7ny,kaiser_xc,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:27:53 2015 UTC,Would it have originally been loaf sugar which is much easy to dissolve anyway?

Red = 1/2 shot of grenadine  Blue = 1 shot of Magellan Gin  White = 1 shot of Ricard and a few shots of water  Look at it for a while to appreciate the fact that it's actually technically red white and blue (kinda), and then mix them together. Ricard + water + grenadine was already a favorite combo of mine, and the gin didn't hurt it at all.

You are totally right, but forget whiskey for a minute (never thought I'd say that).  What about water? If the drink needs more dilution than that little packet, like a simple vodka & cranberry, what can they do? Make quarter sized drinks I guess.   For fizzy drinks, they could add some Alka-seltzer type deal. And for tonic water just fizzy stuff and quinine.   I'd never buy this thing, but if they had 6 reservoirs (whiskey and flat water being added), I think they could make almost any drink the average schmoe would want.   Edit. Oh god.

cocktails,3bv7e2,McSology,15,Thu Jul 2 12:34:32 2015 UTC,"Dude, this is right up my alley, as I graduated college with degrees in Chinese and Gender Studies, lived in China for a while, and now run a classic cocktail bar.   I like some of your observations (particularly the connection between femininity and unaged spirits, and the very creative visual of the masculine elements of a barrel), but very little of your sociology stands up to academic scrutiny. Fertility goddesses are very common creator deities - we still talk about ""Mother Earth"" - and the grunting assertion that man hunt, man protect dainty woman, woman gather is a stereotype that has not been well supported anthropologically. And it is my opinion that there were many more important factors influencing ""what early American men drank"" than ""Manifest destiny! Manly barrels!"" - import troubles, phylloxera blight, Johnny Appleseed, the list goes on.   I was also hoping for more about Chinese drinking culture, especially as it relates to the concept of ""nanzi han"" - I think gendered drinking is an even bigger issue in China than the U.S.  That sort of leads in to what bothers me the most about your piece. I was hoping would end on a stronger note of ""all this history is silly and you should drink what you want."" I felt more pressure to be ""girly"" in China - it took a very short amount of time for me to pick up sa jiao, adding bei or ne onto every sentence, giggle with my hand over my mouth... The first time I was in China was 10 years ago and I remember my roommate getting harassed by a large crowd of people in Nanjing for smoking a cigarette while woman. In my opinion, drinking culture needs to have the playing field (ie expectations) leveled, not hear a pseudoscientific explanation of why things are the way they are.   The global cocktail revolution is awesome and I'm glad to be a part of it, however if women are not explicitly encouraged to be a part of it, we're losing half of the potential creative minds and customer base. The cocktail world has an incredibly strong male bias - if your article was about the male domination of bartending and the history of cocktails, I'd be 100% behind you - but that bias is quite invisible, and I think the best way to fight it is by actively encouraging women to be a part of it and actively supporting their efforts.   This is long and rambly, and I'm on mobile, but I would love to discuss further."
cocktails,3bv7e2,lisomiso,3,Thu Jul 2 15:57:47 2015 UTC,"First off, I'd like to sincerely thank you for your comment! Everything that you have said is completely legitimate, and I will wholeheartedly apologize for not treating this subject with a little more 'due dilligence'.   That said, please let me pontificate a little bit on my role as an operational bar and 'mixology' consultant.   My primary responsibility is to make sure that these guys understand the logistical needs of running an ambitious bar project in a challenging market. This takes up about 85% of my time.   Secondarily, I provide content and programming for the menus, promotions, etc....  Thirdly, I write copy like this for the wei shin audience. For the uninitiated, it's called 'we chat' in English. It's actually a really fantastic social media platform and I highly recommend it.   I completely feel your criticism about the academic scrutiny issue. Unfortunately, at the end of the day, this is an outreach piece. This content is designed to convince people to buy a product... in this case, a high-end, well constructed cocktail... an affordable luxury.   So, If I could be more of a contributor to the canon of industry literature I would love to someday be that... ala Dave wondrich, et al.   However, for today I'm pimping the project I'm working on, and doing what I can to provide a little perspective on something that may be entirely foreign to an uninitiated audience. A sub-100-level introduction if you will... and it is part of a series of similar ramblings.   Perhaps, if you'd be cool with it, I could collaborate a little further with you and someday produce something that will be a little more honorable in every context. Or, even better, maybe this will inspire you to take up the task yourself and you can do what I currently can not. I'd love to chat with you, share a drink if possible, or quite literally learn anything I can from this experience.   Thanks agan,  Mike  p.s. I decided to rename the post to 'an introduction to gender issues in drinking culture from gender issues in drinking culture. Perhaps a better title given the scope."
cocktails,3bv7e2,lisomiso,5,Thu Jul 2 16:11:20 2015 UTC,"I would love to chat more sometime, as this is really the perfect intersection of three of my pet academic interests. Ha.   I do get that it wasn't meant to be an academic piece, but I would still strongly recommend you consider a revision that doesn't alienate women. Like I said, you're excluding half your customer base, and that's the most pragmatic reason to make some edits. What about pulling in something about women holding up half the sky? Or maybe making it less about reaffirming masculinity, and more about strengthening yang energy? Frame it not as a manly luxury, but a luxury that has a proud history of strengthening vital energy. Just a couple thoughts that could play to your audience.   I will say you've perfectly nailed the tone I would expect to see from Chinese propaganda ad copy... whether or not that's a compliment is up to you. ;)"

cocktails,3bv7e2,flea1400,2,Thu Jul 2 13:38:40 2015 UTC,"It is also interesting to consider that the main group that fought to enact the prohibition laws was the women's suffragist movement. In their attempts to ban drinking altogether, they succeeded in setting the stage for the a future where women would no longer feel any pressure to drink things that were perceived as acceptably feminine!   I'm not sure where you are going with that.  Many historians will tell you that the Prohibition movement gave rise to support for women's suffrage.  Basically, it was thought that women disapproved of drinking and therefore if given the right to vote they would vote in favor of alcohol prohibition.  Though as we all know the 18th Amendment (prohibition) was passed before the 19th (allowing women to vote).  But from the standpoint of ""women's rights,"" the idea that suffragists actions would ultimately give rise to the idea that a woman might enjoy drinking whiskey without approbation isn't surprising.    I will tell you from my own experience that as recently as ten years ago I'd get funny looks for drinking straight whiskey.  I'd go to WhiskeyFest and be one of the very few women there who wasn't working a booth.  Now, it's much more normal. I think this has more to do with changing tastes in general."

cocktails,3bv7e2,kanakari,2,Fri Jul 3 02:03:44 2015 UTC,"I would consider rewriting that section as follows:  ""The main group that fought to enact the prohibition laws enlisted the help of the women's suffrage movement.  Due to cultural norms regarding women's attitudes toward alcohol consumption, supporters of the prohibition movement rightly believed that if women were allowed to vote they would vote in favor of probhition.  Ironically, by using women's attitudes toward drinking in furtherance of their attempts to ban drinking altogether, they laid the groundwork for a future in which women would not feel constrained by gender-based expectations on their drinking habits.""  Also, a few other errors: cocktails were not just a hangover cure prior to the middle part of the 20th century.  In fact some of the cocktails you mention like the French 75 are clearly from the WWI era.  And of course Jerry Thomas' cocktail book was published in 1862.  Similarly there are many literary descriptions of women consuming cocktails in that era, but at home, at private parties, not in public bars.   In my opinion, you should rewrite this whole article for clarity and accuracy."

cocktails,3brydi,hebug,24,Wed Jul 1 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"Not Cocktail of the Week #117: Water Lily Apologies everyone, it’s been a while since my last NCotW post, but work has been pretty chaotic lately and I haven’t had the time to find any new cocktails worth writing about. Since my last post on the Kingston Negroni I’ve acquired some crème de violette and wanted to find a tasty cocktail using it to write about. While the go-to standard cocktail for crème de violette is the Aviation, I actually found it a little disappointing as the crème de violette seems to be included primarily for its color and the end result tastes to me like a hollow off-balance Last Word with the combination of gin and maraschino liqueur. Later, a friend looking for recipes using crème de violette came across the Water Lily cocktail and shared it with me. Ultimately my friends and I found the Water Lily much more agreeable, so I decided to write about it for NCotW.  Background The creation of the Water Lily is attributed to Richard Boccato in 2007, during his tenure as bartender at Little Branch in New York City. Described as a “floral variant on the venerable Corpse Reviver #2”, it uses equal parts of gin, Cointreau, and lemon juice, but replaces the Lillet for crème de violette and omits the absinthe. According to the blurb in The PDT Cocktail Book, it is named after “a dear friend of Richard’s whose middle name is ‘Lily’.” While I’m sure many cocktails created on a nightly basis and named after a woman, few make its way into a notable tome of cocktail recipes.     Recipes The PDT Cocktail Book, Jim Meehan, 2011 * 0.75 oz Plymouth gin * 0.75 oz Rothman & Winter Crème de Violette * 0.75 oz Cointreau * 0.75 oz lemon juice Shake with ice and strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with an orange twist.    Bartender’s Choice app, Sam Ross, 2012 * 0.75 oz Gin * 0.75 oz Crème de Violette/Yvette * 0.75 oz Lemon * 0.75 oz Cointreau Add all ingredients to shaker, fill completely with ice and shake vigorously. Strain into glass.   Links and Further Reading Recipe via Kindred Cocktails Article via cocktail virgin slut     Results The Water Lily really highlights what crème de violette can bring to a drink. It starts with a perfumed aroma of sweet flowers and citrus oils. In the mouth it has a full-bodied texture that opens with the bright and tart citrus flavors of lemon and orange. It then transitions to the sweet flower notes of crème de violette and mild citrusy Plymouth gin in the body before finishing with gin botanicals, a heady floral note and orange oil. Something about this combination of flavors evokes candy in my mind at first, but becomes more complex later. This is one of those sour style cocktails that is really best enjoyed while fresh and ice cold from the shaker. I could tell that by the time I finished the drink, its balance had shifted, tasting sweeter and more floral which, while preventing palate fatigue, could easily become overwhelming.    Crème de Violette It’s been a while since I’ve picked up a new ingredient to write one of these special sections, but I wanted to learn a bit more about crème de violette and figured I might as well share my findings. Crème de violette is the generic term for a neutral spirit or brandy-based liqueur flavored and/or colored with natural or artificial violet flowers. I’ve always wondered why certain liqueurs are prefixed with “crème” and why they didn’t seem to be cream-based like Kahlua or Bailey’s. According to The Straight Up blog, the term “crème” is in reference to how the added sugar gives it a creamy texture but then why aren’t all liqueurs considered crème? As far as I can tell, crème liqueurs have a much higher sugar content, but I’m not sure if there’s any strict rule defining it. Crème de violette is flavored with the violet flower or Viola odorata and for the Rothman & Winter offering specifically, the Queen Charlotte and March varieties are used. Violets are not widely grown any longer, though many years ago they were commonly sold in flower stalls as nosegays (the world was once a lot stinkier). These flowers get their unique aroma and flavor from the chemical compound ionone which a minority of people experience as a soapy flavor rather than floral (much like the oft-mentioned unique experiences of cilantro haters). You can read a little more about violets and their use in cocktails in Amy Stewart’s The Drunken Botanist. While relatively scarce ten years ago, the modern cocktail revival has yielded a surprising number of options for crème de violette though the Rothman & Winter offering seems to be the standard for cocktails. Previous offerings such as Crème Yvette and Parfait Amour have some violet flavor, but are blended with a variety of other flavors ranging from berries, citrus, vanilla and spices. Additionally they do not impart the striking color that is expected of a crème de violette. Check out a comparison between Rothman & Winter crème de violette and Crème Yvette courtesy of The Straight Up here. Tempus Fugit and Bitter Truth now also offer a “violet liqueur”, but I can’t really see the advantage of using one of these over Rothman & Winter. Still, if you are interested, there is a comparison between the two found here.     Cheers! If you’ve gone to the trouble to get the ingredients for an Aviation, then you definitely shouldn’t have any trouble putting together a Water Lily. You may even find you prefer it over the Aviation, like I did. Again apologies for the relative infrequent posts recently, I’ve regrettably found myself with fewer opportunities to drink new and interesting cocktails, but NCotW will still continue! I still have much to learn and hope to continue sharing it here with you all. As usual any feedback or discussion is welcome in the comments section below. In particular, feel free to share other favorite recipes utilizing crème de violette or any cocktails you’d like to potentially see in NCotW. Until next time friends, cheers!

cocktails,3brydi,Packin_Penguin,4,Wed Jul 1 17:44:45 2015 UTC,"Is this not more an Aviation than a CR#2, just with Cointreau in place of Luxardo? I see the CR#2 similarity due to the ratios but absinthe is something that radically sets a drink apart.  If I created a riff of a classic and removed absinthe, I wouldn't consider it linked to the original.   What are your thoughts on the relationship of the drinks?   I'm currently debating myself by thinking a Negroni and Boulevardier are related but Gin and Bourbon are wildly different."
cocktails,3brydi,Packin_Penguin,3,Wed Jul 1 21:07:05 2015 UTC,"In this case, comparing them to the Aviation and Corpse Reviver, they both switch out one ingredient, but the resulting cocktail adheres to the Corpse Reviver ratio. That and the ""floral variant on the venerable Corpse Reviver #2"" quote is from the Milk + Honey app, where Richard Boccato spent time working at after Little Branch. I'm no definitive expert, but I ultimately would defer to words presumably referenced from the drinks creator.  As for drink relationships, ultimately the vast majority of cocktails boil down to either aromatic or sour, but other than that distinction, they're all related to one extent or another. It seems foolhardy to try and quantify the qualitative trait of ""relatedness"" beyond that."

cocktails,3brydi,lisomiso,9,Wed Jul 1 18:22:22 2015 UTC,Grand Marnier being brandy-based and having a richer sweetness probably would not work as well. Cointreau has a much cleaner citrus flavor that I think works better in light/botanical/floral cocktails.

The one from Tempus Fugit is too expensive to justify (although it is just lovely and if money was not an object for me I'd keep it around), but I think The Bitter Truth's is worth the couple extra bucks for a change of pace.   The Water Lily is probably my favorite modern classic and I'm glad you featured it this week! Great write up as always."

I find Creme Yvette makes a more balanced/well-rounded Aviation, whereas I feel like each individual ingredient is fighting against each other rather than working together with Creme de Violette, jumping out to me one at a time.  Maybe I should use a gin with less juniper thus not Beefeater or maybe I'm just not a fan of a drink where the Maraschino Liqueur is in the spotlight. Otherwise it's always good to have more recipes calling for Creme de Violette, because God knows when that bottle will ever be finished."

I would suggest a majority of white vinegar with a couple ounces balsamic. If you use a majority of balsamic, it will overpower whatever fruit flavor you are trying to bring to the table.   Berries work very well with balsamic. I have a mulberry shrub sitting in my fridge now that is wonderful.

cocktails,3bq9wl,agusohyeah,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:02:21 2015 UTC,25% of the fernet imported to the U.S. is consumed in SF.
cocktails,3bq9wl,wartzilla,2,Thu Jul 2 16:12:26 2015 UTC,"Copying an older comment I wrote:  Many times when Fernet is brought up in this sub people comment about its consumption in Argentina, so I'll beat them to the chase in what I think might be an interesting bit of trivia. Fernet is insanely popular here. Like top 3 consumed alcohols in the country. Yeah, we produce world-renowned wines, many people drink wine, beer is the first or second choice for most people as in the rest of the world, I assume, but Fernet is a solid third and in many cases second or first. Why is this? well, we had a massive massive italian inmigration wave during 1900-1920, and our culture is pretty much 45% italian 45% spanish, and that's where the tradition of drinking ""el vermú"" (vermouth) might have arose, with local distilleries producing their own version of vermouths and bitters. But as to why Fernet Branca, and not, say, Averna Amaro or Cynar, well I don't know. (Another curious thing is that Cinzano is very very popular here, the go to vermouth, yet when I was in Italy I couldn't find it, and some shop owners told me they don't produce it anymore, that nobody drinks it. Could it be that they don't in the area I visited? (tuscany and the north)  Anyway, Fernet goes with Coca Cola. Not Coca Cola Light (some people do it and they're despicable), never ever with Pepsi. Fernet Branca Menta (mint) also exists but it's much less popular, it's marketed as going well just with Sprite. Never a knockoff brand, at least not in the same price range and a couple ranges below (it's somewhat expensive). It's Fernet and Coke.  People drink it as an aperitif, some during dinner (almost exclusively ""asados"", barbecues) and as a pre-going out, for the road and Club drink. Many people drink only this in pre-clubbing and Club situations. Not so much in Bars, though it's not unheard of. Usually in a 2 part /4 parts ratio, though some people take it up high enough as equal parts.  What is rather unique is that the highest classes, the wealthy, kids that go to the most expensive Unis will drink it on a friday night, but so will the poorer classes. Even from the same ""jar"", which is a big coke bottle with its top cut off and burnt with a lighter to smoothen the jarred edge, used for drinking on the way. There are also (though cheap and considered paint thinner) knockoff brands that come pre-mixed, which ties to the Fernet Branca or nothing I mentioned a couple lines back, it's like the meter goes 0-30% stuff like this 30%-100% Branca.  Fernet Branca isn't really used much in cocktail bars, I haven't seen it myself at least and I usually go mostly there. I've seen many people order a Fernet con Coca in the most expensive, specialized, exclusive cocktail bars. Other amari are gaining terrain, Cynar is quite used in cocktail bars, you see it in supermarkets alongside Fernet Branca, but nothing is at the same level as Fernet in terms of social phenomenom. Alfred drinking it in the final scene of TDKR was very mentioned here (although, of course, he drank it wrong, no Coke?)  I just thought it might result in an interesting read for liquor enthusiasts, since it is something so inexplicable."

My advice would be to be honest with yourself about why you bought this - is it so you can make your favourite drinks at home? Are you planning to get in to this as a job? Do you just want to make some fancy stuff when people come over? Perhaps your reason is a mixture, or it's something else entirely - but once you know WHY you have that, it's a lot easier to know what your next step is.  If it's for you - then teach yourself your favourite drinks. Simple, easy, good times to follow. (And then once you know them, invite friends over to try them!)  If it's to have people over - then whenever you have people over, take stock of your liquor cabinet, figure out one good drink PER base spirit (Vodka, Rum, Gin, Tequila, Whiskey) that you have the ingredients for.  If it's to get started in a job/career, then start with the above, and expand. Your goal here is to develop a working repertoire, but (in my opinion) it is NOT your job to know every drink under the sun. Know many, but know how to say ""I don't know that drink, what can you tell me about it?"" and know how to give a suggestion for something else.  And of course, the most important tips (to me, in order of importance):  Always have fun, always taste what you make (1-2 drops on the back of your wrist, if you're working check local laws), and remember to talk to people!"

cocktails,3bnmjv,Inoko,3,Tue Jun 30 20:23:53 2015 UTC,"Awesome! In that case, have a blast and welcome to the wonderful world of Bartending. There's an entire warren* of things you can expand on once you're more comfortable with what you've got, which is why my recommendation stayed so simple! I think mastering what you and your friends like will be the first step, and then you can start expanding both your own and their tastes.  Looking forward to more fun questions from you in the future~!  *(Yes, it's a warren, because ""let's see how deep this rabbit hole goes"" ;))"
cocktails,3bnmjv,Inoko,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:33:12 2015 UTC,Oh I'm sure I'll have a few currently writing a shopping list of basic things I'll need to get started with basic recipes. thoughts?
cocktails,3bnmjv,hebug,3,Tue Jun 30 21:43:08 2015 UTC,"That depends a lot on what you drink, but here are some basic things that are very flexible (no measurements included, sometimes ingre diets, but I'm on my phone chaperoning some drunks at a party - I mean working the dance floor beer bar);  Vodka - actually one of the harder to plan for as a new bar tender despite how versatile it is. Perhaps because of how versatile it is. While it's easy to do a ""vodka and ..."" (or really anything and ...) I'm going to avoid those. Vodka cocktails are more about the liqueurs and other ingredients. For style and awesome the Moscow mule goes a mile (crushed ice, ginger beer, vodka, lime juice) and the black and white Russian are standards that will serve you well.  Rum - okay, so vodka can be hard but rum has enough flavor it can be the star of a cocktail. If you like dark rums, then you can work on the dark and stormy (bonus - ginger beer doubles up with the mule above), or Mai Tai (strong). Otherwise daiquiris are a great way to go, such as the hemingway way daiquiri (making a resurgance, but uses some specialty ingredients like luxardo). Basic daquiris are a skill that will serve you well anyways.  Whiskey - the Manhattan is a staple but not for everyone. Whiskey sours with egg white are a pain but will teach you an entire class of drink (like daquiris, sours are a drink class or species). Also try the old fashioned, but realize that many whiskey cocktails are pre prohibition or in that style - they are very strong! Whiskey has a lot of flavor and is often in a cocktail just with other liquor. This is probably a spirit that benefits from some liqueurs with a backbone (campari, vermouth, etc.). Bonus - learn the difference between bourbon, rye, Irish, scotch, etc. Whiskeys (whiskys). Generally you can mix anything but scotch in a normal cocktail. Cocktails that ask for scotch generally demand scotch.  Gin - gin is my jam. One thing to note is that it comes in two broad categories - masculine (juniper forward) and feminine (botanical forward) [others might call them something else, that's just what I learned them as]. I recommend learning which one you prefer. I keep one of each but spend more on feminine gins which are what I prefer. Okay now what? This is the only place I'll mention x and y drinks - the tonic you use makes a big difference. (Just kidding, I'm a gin addict) okay moving on. Gin pairs well with other herbals, such as campari and vermouth. Learn how to make a martini (dry, dirty, etc.) And add something like a Collins to your repetoire. Always fun and goes over amazingly on a hot day. Bonus - if you learn a mojito, try a gin mojito with  cucumber.  Tequila - the bastard spirit. Everyone's experience of tequila is mixtos. Okay what does that mean? Well - low end tequila has a dosage - basically they're allowed to top them up with non-tequila. This can be fine but usually results in a horrible hangover. Skip the low end and get 100% blue agave tequila, the difference is worth it. For cocktails - tequila sunrises are fine, but generally the juice masks crappy tequila so use it that way. Otherwise margaritas are crowd pleasers and easy if you've learned daquiris above. Alternatively get and nice aged tequila and enjoy it on ice - not kidding, the better stuff is sippable. Beyond that you're ready for the bastard of all drinks: long island iced tea. It's four of the above spirits (rum, vodka, gin, tequila, - the ""white"" spirits) and triple sec. By the way get triple sec. It's used in a lot of drinks ( and can replace blue curacao, grand marnier,etc.- although not perfectly.)  Hope that gives you some ideas!"

And as /u/StraightoutaBrompton mentioned its like cooking in that its an art more than a science. sure there are some drinks that are codified recipies but dont be afraid to play with it if you like something a little more X or Y.

I actually don't bartend anymore. I was lucky enough to get a bartending position while I was in college. Now I just do it for fun, and man bartending with the craft movement has changed. No one was making these types of drinks even five years ago. That's why I think I can give amateurs some decent advise because even though I did it professionally for a few years I feel like amateur now and I'm starting over.

cocktails,3bnmjv,Sevran,3,Wed Jul 1 08:14:43 2015 UTC,"If you like/are going to do mojitos, my best advice is muddle the limes with sugar, add a dash of soda, then add the mint leaves and muddle them.  Many people muddle the mint leaves with lime and it just results in a drink with shredded mint leaves in it :)  Other than that, get to know how does every ingredient taste, it will give you good ideas to later come up with your own recipes. A lot of people come to me and say ""do something sweet/sour"". Myself, loving sour but not keen on sweet cocktails, make horrible sweet cocktails IMHO, even though no one ever complained...  Good luck!"
cocktails,3bnmjv,slavicswimmer,3,Tue Jun 30 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"I prefer shaking the whole thing (using simple syrup) and straining on crushed ice. It's a less ""interactive"" drink as there is not to muddle, mix or whatever but as least it's consistent from the beggining to the end."

Add the rest of the ingredients and shake with ice. Double strain into a collins glass filled with ice. Top with club soda and garnish with a mint sprig.  And yeah, I don't use crushed ice. Imo you really don't need it this recipe still taste delicious. And unless you have an ice maker that spits out crushed ice (my fridge's crushed ice broke), it's kind of a pain in the ass to make it imo. You need to get a lewis bag and hammer or go crazy making a homemade version of one."
cocktails,3bnmjv,TheFlintSkinny,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:53:01 2015 UTC,What about the limes? And mint leaves give out more flavor if you press them carefully :o

cocktails,3bnmjv,concretepigeon,2,Tue Jun 30 21:53:40 2015 UTC,I find spanked mint is best.
cocktails,3bo60e,SASColiflowerz,10,Tue Jun 30 20:01:42 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that you can over muddle mint to the point of bitterness. This really appears to be a myth propagated by the cocktail community. Here me out.      I just read Jason O'Bryan's blog about the perfect mojito, which prompted my research and own experiment. In it he writes:       ""I muddled the silly fuck out of that mint, then shook it, and still there’s not a single off-putting note in the drink. You cannot overmuddle mint. Please, someone, prove me wrong.""          So I took a few leaves off my mint plant, put them in a shot glass with 1/2 oz. of water and muddled the hell out of them for 30 seconds. Not a single note of bitterness! I don't claim to have the most sensitive palate, but I know bitter, and found none in this sludge of ""over-muddled"" mint. Further, I can't find any legit, peer-reviewed describing chlorophyll as bitter. The closest I found was this old lab manual from 1922 which looks to be a school experiment. And all it says is:      ""FIELD TRIP 111    Thus we should not say that all of these are bitter and hence animals will not eat them, because some animals eat plants for the bitter taste, and we also know now that a bitter taste is always asso-  ciated with chlorophyll. We also know that plants must have chloro-phyll in order to make starch. So that the real reason that plants are bitter is because chlorophyll is bitter.""   Uhhh... yeah correlation ≠ causation. Also, in the EU, chlorophyll is an approved natural color for a wide range of food products, including sweets, baked goods and other things people really don't want to be bitter. I'm siding with Jason on this one.           Oh yeah, mojitos. The other thing he mentioned was not bothering to muddle the mint at all. Instead just shake the mint leaves with the other ingredients (sans soda) and double strain it. The agitation inside the shaker fully extracts the mint flavor. Top with 1-2 oz. soda over crushed ice. The aeration from shaking plus the soda keeps the cocktail light and ice cold. Slap a mint sprig for garnish. This is how you make the best mojito:        2 oz. light rum (rec: Flor de Cana 4 yr - can't beat 1.75 L for $23!) 1/3 oz. gum syrup 3/4 oz fresh lime juice 6-10 mint leaves.       Shake and double strain into a highball filled with crushed ice. I had room for 1.5 oz of mineral water and it was perfect. If you don't have gum syrup, well of course I'd be grateful if you bought ours for $7 here!"

cocktails,3bo60e,eeu890,2,Wed Jul 1 04:21:04 2015 UTC,"Before I had a proper muddler, I tried using the end of a wooden spoon and ended up tearing the mint, leaving me with a green-tinted drink that was completely overpowered by the mint. It was gross. Perhaps not bitter, but I don't recommend tearing or shredding mint or other herbs. I think it makes drinks worse."
cocktails,3bo60e,TheFlintSkinny,2,Wed Jul 1 01:54:29 2015 UTC,"I did the same experiments after reading O'Bryan's blog, and was shocked to find out he was spot on. I couldn't taste the difference between shaken and muddled. One exception was when I used smaller ice cubes and there was too much dilution before the mint flavor was fully realized."
cocktails,3bo60e,eeu890,3,Thu Jul 2 14:54:36 2015 UTC,"Properly muddled mint adds much, much more of a mint flavor than what you will get from slapping them on your hand. I tend to do that only when I'm using it as a garnish. Proper muddling doesn't involve tearing the mint up, so you avoid the bitter or extreme flavors.  Personally, I put in my mint and my sugar, and muddle those. Once I have a nice mint smell, I add my ice, then pour lime juice, rum, and soda in, and stir gently. If a few mint leaves float to the very top, I occasionally will pull those out. I also use a mint sprig as a garnish."
cocktails,3bo60e,dagurb,2,Tue Jun 30 22:20:36 2015 UTC,"I usually do them the way you describe. That way there are no mint leaves floating about in the drink. You didn't mention garnish, but I alway garnish mine with a couple of mint sprigs and maybe a dash of Angostura on top."
cocktails,3bo60e,keefe_town,2,Tue Jun 30 21:58:21 2015 UTC,"Grab a 10.5oz Collins glass  1 sugar cube and .75oz simple syrup at the bottom and muddle. The gritty undissolved sugar gives a nice texture to the cocktail and also changes the flavor over time.  Throw in about six to ten mint leaves, expressed *smack them in your hand. If you muddle mint it becomes bitter from the chlorophyll.  .75oz fresh lime juice  Ice and stir, add 2oz white rum, more ice and stir. Top ice, finish with soda. Should be about 1.5-2oz of soda.   Fresh expressed mint sprig garnish. Simple and very balanced."
cocktails,3bo60e,Moglj,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:23:44 2015 UTC,"From my personal experience, it's dependent on the mint size and species, we commonly use Vietnamese mint (in western Australia). I was trained to slap and stir this drink, rather than shake or muddle, to minimise the bitterness of the stems (both the veins along the leaf and the stalks themselves). I accept the extra mintiness for more aggressive treatment of the leaves, but offer a simple demo (works best with bigger leaves) suck vs chew. Sucking gives a gentle menthol flavor, where as chewing gives a bigger menthol but leaves a bitter finish."

Walmart has larger buying power than either you or your distributor.    H1N1 problems with pricing and availability for eggs, processed eggs and mayonnaise?  What problem? Walmart is still cheaper than anyone else.  I shop my own salesmen for availability and price.  But, there is always that fallback.   Fresh fruit juices or any sort of dairy products?  Always cheaper.  Buying power.  I do the ordering and pricing for a very high volume resort.  We get an across-the-board discount from the big name distributors.  I can always buy commodity products for less from Walmart.  I don't, but our purchasing power is great enough to demand and recieve discounts.  Most places cannot do this.    Tomatoes I buy locally, because they are better.  Milk and OJ?  I do indeed buy those from Walmart.  The savings are drastic.  Most mainstream bitters?  Sure, those small bottles last a long time.

cocktails,3bmwn5,gremy0,8,Tue Jun 30 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"This. This is the answer. Nothing else. The craft movement started with food, then beer, then cocktails; now spirits. Gin is easy to make.

Gin did not increase supply that created its own demand, it's just the most economical product."
cocktails,3bmwn5,highbrowalcoholic,4,Tue Jun 30 20:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, there have been a lot of distillers using gin as a ""quick cash"" product because it takes years to see a return on your whisky.

Having a sideline in gin is a great escape from that potential tight spot."
cocktails,3bmwn5,ithika,54,Tue Jun 30 19:16:35 2015 UTC,"It started in the US with the revival of prohibition era cocktails. Gin is common to that era because people would use the botanicals to mask poorly made bootleg spirits. Gin is also a great cocktail ingredient because it's complex but subtle. Cocktail culture in major cities in the US is exploding. Even generic bars are starting to throw classic cocktails on their menus. Gin is an extension of that boom.  All of this has been part of a general food and drink revolution in the US in response to years of mass produced, bland food and drink that started in the 1950s."

cocktails,3bmwn5,terpichor,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:33:46 2015 UTC,He has a fair point. Gins are a neutral grain spirit with botanicals and citrus steeped in. Vodka is a neutral grain spirit.
cocktails,3bmwn5,NocturnoOcculto,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:38:47 2015 UTC,"Well right. Some gins are certainly made with a vodka base. He yelled at me, in a restaurant, when another friend asked me how gins were made and I told them they were used with a neutral spirit like white whisky or vodka"
cocktails,3bmwn5,terpichor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:53:45 2015 UTC,"White whiskey isn't a neutral grain spirit. They are made from a combination of grains like regular whiskey, just bottled and sold unaged. They are distilled with the result of having a flavor.   Vodka and other grain alcohols are distilled to not have a flavor other than ethanol. To make gin, you add a step to the vodka process by infusing it with other botanicals and citrus. Even the cheap gins, like mccormicks are created by adding artificial flavors to what is essentially vodka."
cocktails,3bmwn5,NocturnoOcculto,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:48:36 2015 UTC,"There are definitely gins made with white whisky, which I just think of as more neutral than aged whisky, my bad for wording. Regardless, gin is delicious and generally the crowd who likes it is a good one. Cheers!"

cocktails,3bmwn5,Chanfan98020,7,Tue Jun 30 20:57:26 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen in the UK it's a lot to do with the craft aspect of it. Craft beers/cheeses/jams/coffee and ""organic""/super nice vegetables etc.  People starting to care about and taste all of their food and drink like win connoisseurs have been doing for years.  I think gin fits the bill well here, because it's easier to come up with different flavour profiles than it is with whiskey/rum etc. So that craft/experience market is covered.  Also, and from a different crowd, you've got people who have spent a lot of time getting fucked up on ""rum/vodka/whiskey"" and coke. Those people have now started to grow up and are looking for something more sophisticated and something to distance themselves from the student masses. So they're heading ales and gins. Something that the students aren't drinking.  tl;dr part pretentious douchbaggery, partly because gin tastes varied and good"
cocktails,3bmwn5,withabeard,12,Tue Jun 30 15:45:55 2015 UTC,"Another note on the craft bit. Gin is easy for new distillers to make because it doesn't require any aging like whiskey or rum. For a brief bit, a lot of distillers marketed ""white whiskey"" or unaged whiskey. The stuff was not good, I drank it mostly for educational purposes.   Gin is just as easy to make, but actually tastes good."

But in general, I think everything just has to have its turn in the spotlight while we go through the cycle, and right now it just happens to be gin's turn as Mad Men is no longer on the air and the bourbon old fashioned has worn out its welcome. Who knows? Maybe rum will be next.  Every summer I peel and seed an English cucumber, chop it up and drop it in a bottle of gin (the larger size). I shake it daily for 12 days, then add a bunch of basil. That stays in for another two days. Strain it and enjoy. By far my favorite infusion."

cocktails,3bmwn5,murrayhenson,2,Tue Jun 30 15:08:30 2015 UTC,"Gin and whisky are both wildly popular right now, although rum, brandy, and tequila are doing plenty of business as well.  I don't think that it is gin and whisky that are popular but spirits specifically and cocktails to a somewhat lesser degree.  I'm not sure where in central Europe you're at, but where I am - Poland - people are starting to tire of the same goddamned lager (Tyskie, Zywiec, Lech, Okocim) and want something - anything different.  We're seeing a variety of craft beer pop up, but this is early days and people - and brewers - are finding what works and what doesn't after the lager dark ages.  Mixed in with the beginnings of the beer revolution, we're seeing some cocktail places pop up.  Again, very early days for this sort of thing though some places have clearly got the right mix of chemicals and a timely bolt of lightning to jumpstart stuff because they're reasonably well-evolved.  Most bars/taverns/pubs though will struggle with anything more complicated than a GNT - I once asked for a whisky sour at a decent-looking place in Krakow and had to explain what went in it.  A GNT, tho, is tough to screw up although - give them credit where it is due - plenty of places have tried their best.  As far as availability goes, there are more brands of gin than rum here but about an equal number of types.  We can pick up genever, London dry, and shove-something-improbable-in-it like Hendrick's cucumber gin and Gabriel Boudier's saffron gin.  I was at a big box store over the weekend and can recall maybe 12 brands of gin, about half or so being bottle shelf, and the rest mid or middle-upper shelf (Beefeater, Bombay, Martin Miller, Hendricks).  I've never seen old tom, plymouth, or sloe gin sold here.  Rum-wise, we mostly see Bacardi and Captain Morgan but usually can find Havana Club as well.  Most places sell regular unaged/NAS rum and some kind of spiced rum.  I recall seeing some Sailor Jerry along with some very expensive stuff (200-250 PLN aka 55-67 USD) that I don't recall the name of.  Alma tends to be good about stocking a reasonable selection of rum."

cocktails,3bmwn5,stgabe,5,Tue Jun 30 16:44:26 2015 UTC,"I believe the trend started on Spain.  I'm traveling there now and every city we've been to has had several Gin & Tonic places all with 50+ bottles of Gin and lots of different techniques for adding stylish garnishes.  I can you tell for sure that the Spanish G&T is its own thing, very different from what you'd expect from a G&T in the U.S. (at least the west coast).  In the U.S. A G&T is usually a simple affair: gin poured into an old fashioned glass with a little bit of tonic splashed on top and a wedge of lime, possibly squeezed.  The Spanish version (for those who are unfamiliar) is served in a very large cup with a lot of ceremony, including mixing the gin with a bit of tonic, pouring almost a full glass of tonic in after and garnishing with a citrus twist or two, dried or fresh fruit and possibly some spices like cloves or crushed peppercorns.  The garnishing is all done with rapidly snapping tongs.  I've even seen orange peels flamed over a G&T.  It's also more common to offer better quality / flavored tonic such as Fever Tree.    IMO they're tasty but some if the craft that goes into them is wasted as most of the garnishes are more visual than flavorful and lot of the selection of gin seems to be more based on brands than flavor.  Still it's awesome to see a cocktail culture that takes itself very seriously and doesn't mind spending a few minutes for one drink.  IMO other cocktails will probably get picked up by this trend and I hope that in 10 years Spain has a really vibrant and varied cocktails scene to match its amazing food.  The only place I've seen that style of G&T in the U.S. was at a Spanish place in Vegas run by Jose Andres."
cocktails,3bmwn5,gnark,2,Wed Jul 1 10:14:15 2015 UTC,"Uff... people here (inb Spain) need to learn when to say when to their garnishes. I don't want a G&T soup, I want a liquid beverage that doesn't need a mate-mate strainer-straw to drink. But yes, gin is huge over here, mostly because vodka is seen as a drink for alcoholics and there isn't much to do with single malt scotch (and whiskey is for old men anyways)."

cocktails,3bnc5s,treitter,6,Tue Jun 30 16:32:27 2015 UTC,"My own answers:    What's your process for coming up with new recipes? How often do you start from scratch vs. modify an existing recipe?    Often, I will have one or two ingredients that I want to experiment with, so I work out what's missing (base spirit, sweetness, sourness, bitterness), fill in what seems like it'd match (or contrast very well), then try it out. I'll often put everything in the tin and take a small sip before adding ice. If it's bland or featuring too many flavors at that point, ice isn't going to fix that.  I probably create new drinks about 5% of the time I make drinks but when I do, I probably start completely from scratch about 75% of the time.    What's the hardest part about making a new recipe?    Coming up with recipes that taste amazing, are relatively simple, repeatable, and haven't been done before (as far as I know). It's hard to get into that intersection but it's always a great feeling when I do.    Does it take you multiple sessions to finalize a recipe?    If I want to really perfect it, yes. It's hard to perfect anything in just a few attempts and it's easy to overwhelm my tastebuds even if I'm just taking a couple sips of each attempt.    Do you try your recipes out on other people before finalizing them?    Usually, but not always. I should probably make this a rule of mine.    Have you made a drink, loved it, forgotten to write it down, and not been able to make it again?    Yes, early into my interest in cocktails. The upside is they probably weren't as good as I thought they were at the time :)    How do you write down your recipes? Notebook? Recipe cards?    Early on, I used a paper notebook but I've done everything in Evernote for a while so I always have access to them anywhere (on my phone) and don't have to find and carry a notebook around.    Have you gotten recipes on your bar menu? Did anyone help you on the final version or did it go on without edit?    I haven't worked professionally as a bartender.    How do you name drinks?    I've got a massive list of drink names I add to whenever a short expression comes to mind and this list grows way faster than my list of recipes, so I tend to pick the best fit whenever I make a new drink. Occasionally, I'll come up with a name on the spot though.  I love for names to hint at the theme or ingredients but it's usually hard to do that without being too on-the-nose or re-using a name that's already taken."

Always multiple iterations, some fruitful, some not.    Other opinions are very valuable.    No, I write everything down, even known recipes. It all goes into notebooks.    Someone asked to put one of my originals on a bar menu somewhere, I don't remember which one or where.    Usually a play on the original drink name that I'm using as a template. For example, right now I'm on the 4th or 5th iteration of a drink using St. George spiced pear liqueur as the primary ingredient.

cocktails,3bnc5s,kanakari,3,Tue Jun 30 22:22:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly hate coming up with something from scratch. My mind goes millions of ways at once. When i first started and i had much less exposure to ingredients and styles of drinks i found it easier because i just thought of simple combinations.   I prefer filling or rounding out a menu, say you need a long drink or we want a stirred gin drink or we want something to be ordered en bulk in a coupe we can sell to groups of ladies. From there it's a much narrower window (with still nearly endless possibilities). After that i'll look at what flavours we are missing on the list and what ingredients are seasonal. If nothing really goes anywhere from there i will look through a database of recipes to see what other people have done.   Hardest part is getting the perfect balance, there are always 5ml adjustments here and there and it comes down to peoples preference so a big tasting panel is good for that. Things to take into account are who you want this drink to sell to, sereotypes can be your friend. For example if it is my quaffable ladies drink i'll err on the side of sweetness, if its my stirred bitter drink i will skew the drink to that taste. These specs can always be changed in the first few weeks if your finding the drink isn't being well received.   Always taste with some friends or try it on a trusted customer (if this is ok in your bar), we normally have a meeting with all the bartenders to present their drinks and finalise tasting, almost always this leads to improving every drink presented.  If i wing a drink completely i often forget exactly how it went but i'll remember what was in it close enough to be able to replicate with a few tries. Only times this fails is if produce is especially variable (berries, melons, stone fruits).  Evernote and phone apps. Scribbled paper at the bar.  A few times.  Naming drinks is either the easiest or the hardest part of the drink."

When the mix is 40% alcohol and 60% water (0.4 x 0.789)+(0.6 x 1), the overall density of the liquid is just over that of ice so it should stay fully submerged at first, though the ratio of alcohol to water will continually decrease as the ice is melting."
cocktails,3bp7tp,anti_climax,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:00:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks again! I'm planning on getting the Wintersmiths so the cubes should be fully clear (no air). Although I feel that the cubes created by Wintersmiths are a tad bit small (edge of 2""). Won't really work with a Double Old Fashioned glass of 13-14oz.  It's preferred to not let the drink fill above the single ice cube, right? That's kind of sad with a 2"" ice cube since you will never get to have a drink where the liquid is more than 1.5-1.75"" high regardless of glass volume (minus cube volume)."

I do this with Palomas and Margaritas as well.  Adds complexity and can get people into Mezcal.  Use Del Maguey Vida or any Joven Mezcal for best results.

In addition, it is a variation of a Boston classic, the Ward Eight -- a drink I have both had out and made myself several times but have yet to blog about. Excerpting from an article in DrinkBoston about it, Brother Cleve described its inception as, ""I wanted to create a drink for the event that would have some sort of New Orleans and Boston connection... So my idea was to take the Ward Eight, the best-known drink created in Boston, and turn it into a tropical cocktail for New Orleans."" The post also goes on to describe the swapping of the Ward Eight's grenadine and lemon for falernum and lime, as well as his reasons for the addition of the St. Germain liqueur and Peychaud's Bitters (and some further colorful commentary about New Orleans and Dorchester, MA)"

But if you're looking for validation for a drink you invented, this seems like it's about as good as you'd get. And if it's for your grandfather, then I don't think it matters if it's real.

One of my creations I call the ""West Coast Negroni""  0.5 oz gin (juniper-dominated London Dry)  0.5 oz Campari  0.5 oz lemon juice  0.5 oz 1:1 simple syrup  1 dash Bitter Truth grapefruit bitters   Shake with ice and strain over fresh ice, then top with 2.5 oz of really hoppy IPA."

cocktails,3bfuxb,dregan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:18:50 2015 UTC,"Nice!  I'd love to hear about the results, and which gin/IPA combination you use.  At my bar I serve it with Junipero gin and Uinta's Hop Nosh IPA.  I like keeping the gin at low levels because it makes it a sessionable cocktail!  You can knock back a fair few of these in one sitting, and for a party could certainly make them by the pitcher."
cocktails,3bfuxb,ems88,2,Mon Jun 29 00:24:34 2015 UTC,"I tried it with your ratios (didn't register that there was only 2.5oz of beer before) but doubled everything. Pretty tasty, I could definitely see this as a nice summer brunch cocktail. I used Grand Teton's Pursuit of Hopiness (Imperial Red Ale) and Hendricks Gin. I think I'm gonna play around with this. I'm imagining a version with a rye IPA, Old Tom Gin and maybe Cynar instead of campari for a more herbal take. Maybe I'll try a rye IPA with a more herbal hop profile than citrus.   EDIT: I have to say it looks absolutely beautiful in the glass with the pink rose colored campari/gin/lemon mixture at the bottom fading to the amber colored beer at the top."

I'll have to go take another look."
cocktails,3bfuxb,dregan,2,Mon Jun 29 05:04:48 2015 UTC,"This is actually very similar to a drink I make and call a Hopflower:  1oz Aperol 3/4oz Saint Germain 3/4oz Lemon Juice    Shake and strain into an old fashioned glass with ice and then top off with 2 1/2 oz citrus-forward IPA.  I use fresh Sculpin.  The idea started with the Jasmine cocktail, which can taste very grapefruity, and then noticing that St Germain both accented that and sweetened it.  Adding a grapefruity IPA was a natural conclusion.  I've made it with compari as well but prefer the Aperol version.  I also have a hoppy Negroni but for that I use hop-infused gin.  I also swap Aperol for Compari in this one.  In both cases the hops add enough bitterness that the compari is overkill.  Other than that it's a standard Negroni."
cocktails,3bfuxb,stgabe,4,Mon Jun 29 00:35:33 2015 UTC,"I call this ""Runner in the Garden""  2 oz Rye Whisky  1 oz Duchesse de Bourgogne or any Flanders red/brown, or Oud Bruin  1/2 oz Campari  1 tsp of Simple syrup  2 dashes of bitters  Stir with ice, strain into coup glass, garnish with a orange rind."
cocktails,3bfuxb,See_Em,3,Sun Jun 28 22:32:00 2015 UTC,"Since it's summer, I love cheladas (or micheladas as they are more commonly known to the kids)   1 can modelo or similar  1/2 to 3/4 ratio of clamato  Squeeze up to one good lime or two disappointing limes  Maggi seasoning, or other salty chile seasoning  Dash Worcestershire and/or soy sauce   Dash of hot sauce. Some people say Tabasco, but I did sambal oloek and a dash of apple cider vinegar and it was off the fucking chain.   Maybe some more salt sprinkled on top for good measure or salt the rim.   I only ever make them when I'm hung over, really, so sorry for the sloppy recipe. You just have to futz with the balance between the beer, lime, and clamato, and the umami stuff can tie it together a little.   Made right, they are basically a refreshing bloody Mary that doesn't taste like shit, and are a truly magical hangover cure. As you can see, you can approach these with variations like a bloody Mary, but definitely have a Mexican make you one sometime.  If I went to brunch and they had these made right, I would be ecstatic."

cocktails,3bfuxb,raevnos,2,Mon Jun 29 02:12:41 2015 UTC,"I once worked with a renowned bartender who told me some really great advice for beer cocktails: don't forget mouthfeel.  Often beer tends to water down drinks and make them unpalatable. Use something with body to help balance out the lightness of the beer, be it a higher proof spirit, rich simple syrup, or a concentrated juice.   After tinkering I came up with:  1.5oz Haymans Navy Strength Gin  .75oz Zucca  .5 oz Lemon  .25oz Rich Demarrara Simple  Shake with ice, pour 3 oz of Tecate into the shaker and pour into a Collins glass filled with ice. Top with pickled Rhubarb ribbon."

cocktails,3bg64i,chjmor,2,Mon Jun 29 02:59:40 2015 UTC,Definitely a perceivable difference. Prosecco is notably fruitier.  Cava is a much better option
cocktails,3bg64i,ems88,2,Mon Jun 29 01:56:17 2015 UTC,"Right now the sparkling wine I use for cocktails at work is Poema Brut Cava.  Generally it's easier to find a decent Cava or Californian sparkler at cocktail-mixing prices than a true Champagne.  With sparkling wine, there's also a wide array of nicer producers that sell half bottles or even splits (single-glass bottles)."

cocktails,3bdbaz,hamfast42,5,Sun Jun 28 03:30:43 2015 UTC,"Right now I am drinking a Julep with Old Grand dad. My personal feeling is that you should never use a sipping Whiskey in a Julep. Some suggestions:   Rebel Yell - Wheaty bourbon, so mild. $10 a fifth. Surprisingly good. Weller 107 or 12 year - Another wheater, quite easy drinking. Old Grand Dad - More robust, drier bourbon $17 a fifth. $20 For the 100 proof which is certainly with the dough. Wild Turkey 101 - More Rye, a bit spicier $20 Jim Beam Black - Even spicier that the Wild Turkey $20 Buffalo Trace - More balanced, rich and full $23   When I make these for a party I usually offer two choices: a mild bourbon like Rebel Yell, and stronger bourbon, both in booze and flavor, like Wild Turkey 101."
cocktails,3bdbaz,antiwittgenstein,4,Sun Jun 28 06:50:39 2015 UTC,I agree with you. I usually use Old Grand Dad or Evan Williams.

Then, add 4 large block cubes, shake for another 20 secs. Double strain into chilled coupe (or juice glass in my case). Top with 4 dashes of peychauds and make cool design.

cocktails,3b744o,bclan11,7,Fri Jun 26 16:08:26 2015 UTC,"When you turn this into a flip, the egg dries things out and more sugar is needed.  More sugar also helps to keep the egg from beginning to stink as you drink it."

I always use angostura in my bourbon flips but I don't know jack about what's traditional.

cocktails,3b744o,twitch1982,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:40:05 2015 UTC,the whole egg including Yolk? Sorry I'm a noob.
cocktails,3b744o,post_with_the_most,7,Fri Jun 26 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"Sours vs flips:   Nogs and flips both use the whole egg. The difference is that eggnog (and its cousin, the Tom and Jerry) generally also uses milk and/or cream. Flips can contain cream, beer, or other ingredients but don't require those elements, whereas nogs, by definition, contain dairy in addition to eggs.   Sours and fizzes can be made either with or without eggs. A sour is simply a drink with citrus juice in a starring role, adding a sour component to the drink. A fizz can have similar ingredients, but it's topped off, just prior to service, with soda. (I'm oversimplifying somewhat here so that I can focus on the eggs and not the other components of each drink. For a fuller and more complete discussion, refer to Paul Clarke's Tippler's Taxonomy.)  The egg components of each drink are pretty straightforward:  The sour never uses a whole egg, only (in some cases) the white. The pisco sour is the best-known example. The fizz can use the white alone (in which case, it's a Silver Fizz), the yolk alone (Golden Fizz), or the whole egg (Royal Fizz). In the modern bar, however, the Golden and Royal Fizzes are almost entirely unheard of. The best-known variant today on a Silver Fizz is the New Orleans classic, the Ramos Gin Fizz.

Liberty in Cap Hill is fun, and they have sushi.  Suite 410 is kind of a bartenders bar, but it isn't my favorite.  Witness in Cap Hill has fun southern style cocktails.

If you wanna be more fruity, you can just ask for a mix of juices: orange + pineapple is a decent one, and maybe even add some cranberry for color / sour.   sky's the limit, really... one speakeasy I like serves ""siphon water"" which is just soda with angostura and a slice of cucumber. I like to change mine up by using both angostura and orange bitters, though.   good luck!"

cocktails,3b3r40,The-Good-Doctor,3,Fri Jun 26 13:26:09 2015 UTC,"Depending on where you're drinking, just ask for a garnish. Or, ask for whatever you're ordering in a Collins or a rocks glass (instead of a pint glass, which basically zero cocktails get served in). Even if it's just water, soda/tonic/sprite with a lime wedge, etc., it's going to look like a glass of booze if it's in a glass that booze gets served in. It's dead easy for a bartender to do, they (should) understand what and why you're doing it immediately, and they won't give a damn. If you're there to have fun and can do it without booze in settings where everyone else is boozin' up, more power to ya.  OR, if you're somewhere where the cocktails are proper cocktails (as opposed to, say, collegey shots and things with Red Bull in it), ask your bartender for a mocktail. They won't mind (in fact, many will enjoy the challenge of preparing something that doesn't contain booze), you get something that's nearly as interesting to drink as something with alcohol in it, and you get to drive your car home at the end of the night.

Even in places that have menus, they only show the bar's popular drinks, and even then they don't always show a price for anything. Can someone explain to me how to guess at how much my drink will cost when I go to a bar? Or am I supposed to not ask, and just take a gamble?"
cocktails,3aydw2,CrazyPlato,11,Wed Jun 24 16:38:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on what the bar pays for the ingredients and their markup. For instance an old fashioned shouldn't cost more than the whiskey it's made with, because everything else in the drink costs pennies to the bar. Something like a last word is trickier (the most expensive thing in there is the half shot of Chartreuse) and is likely to have a dedicated button in the POS. Aside from that, at least where I've worked, it's a bit of bartender discretion, and we have generic $7 (and so on) cocktail buttons in the POS.  Feel free to ask how much something costs, it's a pretty normal concern."
cocktails,3aydw2,beermanbarman,11,Wed Jun 24 16:49:23 2015 UTC,"For instance an old fashioned shouldn't cost more than the whiskey it's made with, because everything else in the drink costs pennies to the bar.   You're forgetting labor.  A whiskey on the rocks takes, let's say, 10 seconds.  An Old Fashioned maybe a minute from start to finish.  That's the reason for an upcharge.  Also, depends on what all is going in it.  We use demerara syrup that we make in house so I don't know the cost, but the cane syrup we buy costs something like 45 cents an ounce for us.  So, with a drink that gets a half ounce of cane syrup, I should charge another dollar to hit my marks."
cocktails,3aydw2,Spodyody,4,Wed Jun 24 17:47:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, labor is a consideration, but let's not kid ourselves, that's at best just kind of fudging a number. For instance your dollar for the labor of making an old fashioned in a minute comes out to 60 dollars an hour. Does it really cost the bar that much, even including training and bar spoons and opportunity cost of making other drinks? Probably not. I'm willing to stomach a dollar up charge for a nice old fashioned with a big fancy ice cube and fancy sugar, but much more than that verges on predatory in my eyes. But the base truth of the matter is bars can charge whatever their clientele will let them get away with."
cocktails,3aydw2,beermanbarman,6,Wed Jun 24 19:25:36 2015 UTC,"Opportunity cost is exactly why it's reasonable to charge more for Old Fashioneds (and cocktails in general). That extra minute that the barman is spending on making an Old Fashioned (ignoring the theatre certain customers come to expect from the drink leading to the whole 5+ minute debacle), rather than a Bourbon on the rocks, is time he isn't making other drinks. On busier nights in my bar it definitely wouldn't be outrageous to assume an extra £60 could be taken from making Spirit mixers over a cocktail.  Where I disagree is when Old Fashioneds are more expensive than other cocktails without using better ingredients. There is a place near me that charges £2 more for a Old-Fashioned than it does for a Manhattan, using the same Whisky, that makes no sense to me"
cocktails,3aydw2,tryan3181839,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:52:45 2015 UTC,"I'm still a bit dubious, honestly. Yes, there are scenarios where you might lose some sales if you can't serve customers fast enough due to making time consuming drinks. But they should not be common. If service is so slow at a bar that people are consistently leaving instead of buying more drinks , that's a bar that has a much bigger problem (staffing or training most likely). You could argue the opposite direction even, that higher prices on drinks can contribute to selling fewer of them, thus hurting the bar.   At the end of the day, I'm not going to knock a bar too hard for adding a surcharge for 'labor' to certain drinks, and I even employ it myself when it seems appropriate, but it is at least half an illusion."
cocktails,3aydw2,beermanbarman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:38:53 2015 UTC,"For the most part I agree, certainly is service is slow slow that people are leaving or even getting annoyed at the wait time, that's part of a bigger issue. But form a simple economics point I know that in the say 1 and a half minutes it takes me to make and serve (including payment) one £8 old fashioned I could have done orders for say 6 or 7 spirit mixers (£35-£49), and that's being quite liberal as we don't have soda guns so have to pop bottles for mixers.  Yeah it's all hypothetical and chances are the order I'd get instead of the one cocktail would probably end up being a ""soda water and fresh lime"" but still, makes sense to have that surcharge for cocktails, it would almost beg the question as to why nowhere has tried charging extra depending on the variety of an order.

cocktails,3aydw2,MileyCylon,11,Wed Jun 24 20:36:04 2015 UTC,I was at a speakeasy style bar in Atlanta and asked how much a lagauvlin was and bartender told me if I have to ask I can't afford it. So I just left and went next door to another bar. I've paid as little as $12 for 2oz of lagauvlin and paid as much as $28. Sorry I was just curious.

However, on one of my trips, when I was waiting for my friends, I asked for a cocktail to be made on the weak side. The bartender got really flustered, I explained that I didn't want a lot of alcohol, and in the end he poured me something in a big glass that contained about 50% tequila. I love booze - especially tequila - but this was strong. So I don't know how well the concept works if the bartender can't follow simple instructions."

cocktails,3aydw2,MsRhuby,12,Wed Jun 24 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"The reason why cities like NYC and London, etc., have so many bars without signs or obvious entrances is because there's no problem attracting customers. It also makes the job a lot easier because you don't need a lot of security on the door. Plus, prevents overcrowding the bar, which is a much bigger issue than potentially having an empty one."

It forces you to read your clients that much closer.

I soaked a pound of it in 2 cups of Everclear, along with the peel of one orange and one grapefruit, a stick of cinnamon, and some crushed green cardamon pods. I let that soak for 15 days before straining it. This is the first cocktail I made form it!  The cocktail consist of 2oz Victoria Gin, 1/2oz lime juice, 1/2oz simple syrup, 1/2/ rhubarb bitters. Shaken over ice and served in a chilled glass with a lime peel.   The bitters seemed to have developed a lovely floral note that really complimented the gin, as well as the smallest hint of spice.   This was my first attempt at making homemade bitters and it was a success! I am probably going to give orange bitters a try next!  Here is a picture of the rhubarb bitters.

cocktails,3awe7p,thatguy8856,6,Wed Jun 24 01:16:02 2015 UTC,"My guess is, the blueberry syrup realm is not yet saturated."
cocktails,3awe7p,stonedcoldwasted,3,Wed Jun 24 01:44:25 2015 UTC,"same, Death & Co book has a recipe for the syrup and like one or two cocktails that actually call for it. (Fun fact banana syrup in their book only has one drink that calls for it, but the syrup is a lot of fun to use). Anyway, I made the blueberry syrup once and it went horrible wrong, ended up boiling out too much water and made blueberry jam and had to re-dilute it. besides the final result being kind of shit for me I found difficulty using it, it wasn't very versatile over-dominated a lot. I decided between the pain in the ass it was to make and the lack of ways to use it I will never make it again.  Anyway looking at the picture I'm guessing OP's blueberry syrup came out much better, but the drink recipe looks off balanced too me, I'm guessing this is shaken that's the vibe I get from the ingredients (muddle mint and ginger mostly, but even the blueberry syrup given the amount), and it sounds like it's really sweet and some of the ingredients from my experience feel like they wouldn't go well together. Imo I would drop the St. Germain altogether and get some lemon juice in there. Instead of muddling ginger you might consider looking into make ginger syrup, you can grate ginger and then there is two options. 1) bring water to boil, set aside add the grated ginger and steep for an hour, strain to a cheesecloth. about 1cup ginger to 10 cups water should give a large and solidly spicy yield. At this point you basically have ginger beer. Then just take what you need and 1:1 with superfine sugar and just like regular simple. or 2) take the grated ginger and strain through a cheesecloth, then take the strained ginger liquid and combine with superfine sugar in a 1:1 ratio.   I would recommend option 2) will prob be nice and spicy and .25 oz should be enough I think.  Just my $.02 from looking at the recipe take all this with a grain of salt, but it might be nice to try it out."
cocktails,3awe7p,thatguy8856,2,Wed Jun 24 06:53:31 2015 UTC,"If you boil the blueberry syrup, you could probably just incorporate the ginger juice into that while it's hot.  Then you can just use one syrup instead of two in the cocktail.    And I totally support dropping the St. Germain.  That stuff tastes like perfume.  Lemon juice is a good call.  Or even lime.  Lime and blueberry are quite nice together.    Cheers!"
cocktails,3awe7p,terpichor,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:58:55 2015 UTC,There's also domains de cantons which is a ginger liquor.. Haven't worked with it personally so not sure of the taste.  The point of the ginger is to cut the sweet profiles of the mint and st germain. But gin and st germain go together like penut butter and jelly   The banana syrup sounds like it's next.
cocktails,3awe7p,kanakari,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:08:10 2015 UTC,"Im not sure how your blueberry syrup came out, but mine came out quite tart and very dominating. St Germain is very sweet and dominating. Thus from my experience I would think the two would clash. Unfortunately can't tell how your drink tastes.   My reasoning for making two syrups is that now their are two different usable syrups in your bar stock, making a blueberry ginger syrup becomes very drink specific.  I'm curious to know how you made the blueberry syrup if you don't mind sharing."

Is there any value in these bottles?... They are all sealed with high fill levels except the Ararat 3 year which may have evaporated a bit even though the seal is in tact. I ask because my grandfather's intent is to sell them if they have any significant value, if not we will gladly mix with and drink them as my roommate and I already have quite an extensive home bar.

Depending on the storage conditions - light, temperature, sealing, etc. - they may or may not taste all that great."
cocktails,3aw9e3,Jeikobu1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:24:43 2015 UTC,"Cool dark basement cellar... I've had other bottles from this cellar that are 30+ years old: a Harvey's Bristol Cream (just like the one pictured) which tasted great, and an opened bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label from the early 80s which had been opened long ago. Both tasted great. I have no doubt then since the seal is perfect that light and temperature were not an issue."

cocktails,3aw9e3,RabbitRaver,3,Wed Jun 24 07:25:46 2015 UTC,I know it's pre 1988 because there's no government warning on it. The UPC code means it has to be late 70s at the earliest. Wondering if you have any idea what a US market bottle from that era would be worth.

I do. When I say it has no value vs what it currently sells for it is an informed opinion. Is yours?  From my perspective it seems like pure speculation.   Edit: whoops thought we are talking about Harvey's. Sorry for being an ass.
cocktails,3awajg,thedanzadude,2,Wed Jun 24 00:41:12 2015 UTC,"Two weeks ago I took a week long vacation in Rome. While I was there I fell in love with grappa and figured there must be some decent cocktail applications for this stuff. I figured if I took a basic sour recipe and made a few Italian adjustments I might have something characterful and delicious. Good news, it worked!   2 oz. aged grappa 1 oz. limoncello 1 oz. fresh squeezed lemon juice 0.25 oz. simple syrup."

cocktails,3awajg,Kittykathax,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:47:09 2015 UTC,"For this one I used Berta Monpra Invecchiata. I found it to be a bit uninspiring to sip, but the flavours pushed through the cocktail well."

cocktails,3awajg,Kittykathax,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:44:21 2015 UTC,"If you have access to a more complex and rustic limoncello than the one I used, do it. Preferably something less neon yellow. It's a refreshing cocktail as is, but a brighter tasting limoncello would lift it.  I'm thinking next time I might throw in a couple dashes of Galiano to see if it adds another layer of complexity to the cocktail. The grappa invecchiata I used already has some vanilla and anise qualities, so it should mesh well."

cocktails,3au03l,thedanzadude,3,Tue Jun 23 19:54:52 2015 UTC,No clue. Maybe certain parts are stainless and others nickel over brass?
cocktails,3au03l,tarunteam,3,Tue Jun 23 19:59:00 2015 UTC,It's the traditional way to serve a Mint Julep.
cocktails,3au03l,thedanzadude,2,Tue Jun 23 18:31:20 2015 UTC,"Glass is a great insulator, while metal is an excellent conductor and therefore chills much more quickly when ice is added to it. The metal cup also forms a layer of frost on the outside of the glass and helps keep the julep cold, longer. There's a little lip on the base of the cup that you can hold onto which keeps your fingers from getting too cold."
cocktails,3au03l,hebeykikeburga,4,Tue Jun 23 18:14:35 2015 UTC,Shit someone really put thought into this cup.
cocktails,3au03l,tarunteam,3,Tue Jun 23 18:20:11 2015 UTC,I'm no rocket surgeon but wouldn't the insulating effect of glass keep a drink cooler longer? Metal is a conductor therefor would wick away heat/cold from the beverage right?
cocktails,3au03l,hebug,2,Tue Jun 23 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"Cooling a drink is heat transfer, therefore by using metal, which is a conductor, the heat in the drink is very quickly transferred (conducted) from the inside of the cup to the outside. Once the heat is transferred to the outside of the cup it dissipates into the surrounding medium (the air on the periphery of the cup) thereby maintaining the chilliness of the julep."

cocktails,3ar0rg,hebug,7,Mon Jun 22 21:23:06 2015 UTC,"Posted some reviews of the cherries themselves in another comment.   The bar I work at uses the Griottines exclusively. They're pretty unique, and no cocktail bar in the area has them. Also, they're cheaper per unit than Luxardo cherries (~$0.15 per cherry vs ~$0.50 for Luxardo), and go well with almost any cocktail. The liquid the're packed in is much thinner than Luxardo syrup so you don't get much of it in your drink unless you want to add some with a barspoon.  As for specific cocktails for each, it really depends on what you like. I've had the Griottines with everything from bourbon old fashions and Manhattans, to Last Words and Aviations. They're really versatile. They are quite subtle and will work with just about any cocktail. That last sip with the cherry and the kirsch/syrup that sunk to the bottom is just heavenly.  Luxardo are of course the the top cocktail cherry for a reason. Obviously great with Aviations ect. There really is no substitute when you just have to have that velvety goodness.  The Fabbri Amarena are pretty close to the Luxardo though, but the velvetyness just isn't there and the tartness might be overwhelming in certain cocktails. I'd probably use them as a complement to more citrus based cocktails, I'd try whiskey sours.  I already mentioned in the other post how the Prada a Tope Guindas en Aguardiente go really well with some spiced Manhattans, so far haven't tried them in anything else.  Don't plan on buying Jack Rudy's again. They aren't bad but I'll make my own bourbon cherries next time to get some real deep flavor out of them. Obviously these go best with bourbon cocktails."
cocktails,3ar0rg,baumpop,5,Tue Jun 23 01:19:33 2015 UTC,Fun note the luxardos are the remains from after they pit them to make luxardo. The luxardo family has owned the same orchard since the 18th century. Probably the same cherries Harry craddock used.

cocktails,3ar0rg,SenorDing_Dong,3,Tue Jun 23 13:18:58 2015 UTC,"Posted some Luxardo vs Griottines in another comment, I'll try the rest here.  The Framboisines: Tasty, similar to the griottines in preparation. It has it's downsides though. They are very fragile and mine came over 50% destroyed during shipping, just a raspberry/alcohol mush on the bottom of the jar. And the seeds are kinda hard, get stuck in your teeth. I use these for pancake topping now :)  The Amarena Fabbri: Similar to Luxardo, packed in a rich velvety syrup. These are brighter and more tart than the Luxardo, with the cherry being a little softer as well. Nice alternative for the price, as it comes with about 50% more for the same price.  The Guindas en Aguardiente: Very different. Unpitted, somewhat bitter with a soft texture.These are packed in spiced aguardiente, infused with cinnamon, mint, anise, and coffeebeans. Great choice for a spiced up Manhattan with strong bitters and maybe an absinthe rinse.  The Jack Rudy Bourbon: These are nice firm cherries, stem on. The cherries themselves have a hint of bourbon taste to them, though it could use more. The liquid they are packed in has even less bourbon flavor. I'll have to try the Woodford Reserve brand bourbon cherries next time to compare, or maybe make my own for stronger bourbon flavor.  The Trader Joe's Dark Morello: Very tart, very soft cherries. Packed in a much lighter syrup than Luxardo or Fabbri. They are very cheap too, $4 at the physical store (amazon reseller are super overpriced)"

cocktails,3ar0rg,dregan,2,Mon Jun 22 22:29:12 2015 UTC,"Not exactly no. They each have a very different flavor profile/mouthfeel.   The Luxardo are quite velvety, sweeter and tarter than the Griottines.   Their liquid is also different. The Luxardo are in a thick rich syrup while the Griottines are packed in alcohol mixed with Kirsch and sugar which is tasty, but has a slight astringent quality to it being alcohol based vs being sugar based as is Luxardos.  The Luxardo cherries themselves have a more candied texture. The Griottines are smaller, and they are softer on the inside with a more composed skin.  All that said, both are wonderful in cocktails and tied for my favorites."

cocktails,3arzb7,DontUseThat,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:29:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on the ABV. If you need it to last an extra long time, don't pre-dilute it. Although even diluted, if it's an all booze cocktail (ie manhattan - whiskey, vermouth, bitters) they should last months as long as they don't get too warm. Vermouth will oxidize after a while (weeks), so they will definitely taste different, but they won't go bad. I'd be wary leaving something with fresh juice more than a few days, as the brightness of the citrus will fade fairly rapidly."

cocktails,3arxz7,thatguy8856,2,Tue Jun 23 15:49:06 2015 UTC,Personally I like to use simple syrup with ice tea as to blend the sugar I'm better. Actually might make a batch soon. Gonna do a blend of teas. The rule I follow is cold brew so 2tsp to 8 oz water and steep with cold water 8-12 hours. Green teas are supposed to get a lot of sweetness from a cold brew hence my suggestion of a blend. I'm also gonna do a tea simple syrup this batch.

cocktails,3ap6kz,cocktails13,13,Mon Jun 22 11:06:49 2015 UTC,"So many horrible Caipirinha recipes being posted these days. You put the sugar on the lime before you muddle everything. Also, a whole lime for 2 oz. of Cachaca is too much IMO. You're better off just using half a lime, center pith removed, cut into quarters.  If you want a decent recipe, this one has always served me well."
cocktails,3ap6kz,dagurb,3,Mon Jun 22 14:33:07 2015 UTC,"Great recipe, I love Chris McMillan videos. However, traditionally, the caipirinha is not shaken. Just stirred on the glass.   Yes, of course, you can break tradition and shake it (even in Brazil, many bartenders do) to get the sugar, lime and cachaça evenly distributed, but personally I prefer to prepare it the traditional way.  ps. goddamnit OP, don´t ever suggest putting soda in a caipirinha as a variation. If you want to fuck up the drink, do it like brazilians do: mix it with an assorted mix of fruits and replace cachaça with vodka or sake."
cocktails,3ap6kz,fabio1,2,Mon Jun 22 17:01:58 2015 UTC,"Well it depends on your taste, the posted recipe is my favorite one..!  In my opinion 1/2 lime is certainy not enought for 2 oz. of Cachaca, 3/4 is the absolute minimum, I prefere a whole one for a good balance of the ingredients (I tried different variations and thats also what almost every cocktail guide recommends..!).  If you like the taste of the lime peal (which fits very well with Caipirinha, gives some extra tropical touch..) then add the cane sugar before muddeling. Be aware that you should use untreated limes or wash them at least under hot water. You can add the cane sugar after muddeling, thats fine too..  Try it out..!"

Mojito is composed of brown rum, only 1/2 lime, mint, cane sugar and lots of crushed ice (my favorite version, some people prepare it with white rum, ice cubes and a dash of soda). If you like Mojitos you certainly like Caipirinhas too, both are very famous and tasty summer cocktails which go down well with women and men.

cocktails,3amq61,Sabu113,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:01:02 2015 UTC,You appear to dry shake without any of the other ingredients? Any reasons for this? I ask as someone who has always shaken all ingredients without ice then with ice for Clover clubs and indeed all egg white cocktails.
cocktails,3amq61,Duke_Silver,2,Sun Jun 21 23:16:37 2015 UTC,"I dry shake just the simple syrup, lemon juice, and egg white, usually using a milk frother (super helpful, super cheap, highly recommend it). http://amzn.com/B00MJFH9KS  One thing is that I don't want to run my milk frother through the seeds of whatever I'm muddling into the drink, so the raspberry has to come in after that.   The other is that I think dry shaking all your ingredients gets the drink too ""equally aerated"" (i'm bullshitting at this point, this is just a guess of mine as to why I've always done it this way, because it makes sense to me) and so when I froth the other ingredients, the amaretto and the bourbon (which I don't like SUPER aerated) can form more of the body of the drink, even when everything cools down. I think it helps promote a more clean line between the drink and the foam, basically.   I dunno, really. I guess besides wanting to avoid getting seeds in my handy dandy milk frother, I guess I just wanted to blend the most basic ingredients together."

cocktails,3anpy6,kbakermemphis,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:16:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I forgot to get back to this. Maybe I'm misunderstanding you. You said, does an amaro have to be redistilled so I thought you meant make an amaro (add sugar, macerate with botanicals) then redistill it (run a second distillation) to remove sugar, and most of the flavor you added and add more botanicals to the tun.  Liqueurs, as far as I understand them, are sweetened, flavored spirit. The sugar is the main component in them that differentiates them from say, apple whiskey. Maybe you could run a second distillation with botanicals in the mash but it seems like a lot of work when you could just macerate it."

How did you make the old fashioned you tried??  And no, the cherry isn't essential at all. I prefer 2:1 whiskey to vermouth, or even a little more whiskey. Taste the vermouth and see how you like it, it might take some time to adjust to the taste. I didn't like manhattans much at first so I used less vermouth than most people recommend, but over time I've upped it to the normal 2:1 and I love it now. Typically stirred with ice and strained into a chilled glass is best, but I enjoy it on the rocks as well (one big cube). A lemon peel is a nice touch, too."

cocktails,3aotyh,Whatsthisplace,2,Tue Jun 23 01:06:50 2015 UTC,"The cherry is not essential, though it's a nice touch if you have some good cherries handy. I'd rather skip it than use one of the bright red jarred cherries. You could also garnish with a bit of lemon or orange peel (make sure to avoid the white pith), or omit the garnish entirely.  At least to start with, yes, you do want to measure the drink. A jigger is convenient, but you can use any measuring tool. You probably at least have a tablespoon handy; one tablespoon is 0.5 oz. A good ratio to start with is 2 oz whiskey, 1 oz vermouth, 2 dashes of bitters. If your whiskey is lower proof (80-86), maybe use a little less vermouth. Stir with ice and strain into a chilled glass (put it in the freezer).  I'm not familiar with Prichard's, but since the Midwinter Night's Dram is port-finished, it'll make a less standard Manhattan. So if the Prichard's is a pretty standard rye, I'd go with that.  Other vermouth-based cocktails include the Martini, the Negroni (and many variations), the vermouth cocktail. Here are a few more. Good vermouth can also be enjoyed on the rocks, or with club soda. A twist of lemon or orange won't hurt."
cocktails,3aotyh,jeremyjack33,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:08:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the garnish info!  I have a cocktail jigger but I don't know what volumes it holds. How much is a dash? How long do you chill the glass and is a martini glass ok? Is there an order I should mix it in? The Prichards (86 proof) is a standard rye and while the MWND (98.6 proof) is delicious neat, its probably too sweet for this. If only I could procure one of the BTAC ryes....  I appreciate the link! Can you drink vermouth neat?"
cocktails,3aotyh,Worst_Lurker,2,Mon Jun 22 20:54:10 2015 UTC,"If you really want to get into cocktails, you will have to get a book or two about technique like Jeffrey Morgenthaler Bar book.   A dash, is just a dash... like a dash of hot sauce or whatever..  For the glass, their are many ways to chill a glass, put it for a minute in the freezer or put a few ice cubes in it, even with some water, or even use liquid nitrogen if you have some (and know how to use it... don't do it). A martini glass is ok, for my taste the nicest manhattan are served in cocktail coupe, but that's only a matter of looker.   You don't need a BTAC rye for a manhattan... i'm all for quality ingredient but a decent rye or bourbon is more than enough...   Generally you should mix your ingredient in your mixing vessel (glass, shaker, mixing glass) from the cheapest to the most expensive. Eggs must be the last ingredient.   Vermouth is delicious neat, a bit sweet for my taste though, but a lot of people drink it neat (but chilled) or with a few ice cubes."
cocktails,3aotyh,countbase,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:32:15 2015 UTC,"I'll give that book a look.  So a dash is smaller than say a shot?  Don't think I have a coupe glass, so I'll use the martini one for now. Freezer seems optimal.  Yeah I know I don't ""need"" a BTAC rye haha. I was just imagining what a BTAC Manhattan would taste like.  So bitters, vermouth, rye, ice, stir, serve? Eggs?!!  Just tried it neat! It's like a dessert wine but with a bitter finish (sort of gin-like?). I enjoyed it!"
cocktails,3aotyh,countbase,2,Tue Jun 23 01:55:24 2015 UTC,"No eggs in a Manhattan. Some people use an egg white in a whiskey sour and similar cocktails, to give it a rich mouthfeel.  A dash is what comes out of a bottle of bitters when you give it one firm shake. It's like an eighth of a teaspoon.  You can drink vermouth neat, straight out of the fridge. (Yep, vermouth goes in the fridge.) At room temperature, I imagine sweet vermouth would be a little cloying, and dry vermouth a little astringent.  Most jiggers hold 1.5 oz on the larger side, and 0.75 on the smaller side. They also make them in other sizes, though, e.g. 2 oz and 1 oz. You can measure with a tablespoon.  The order of ingredients is not critical if you are measuring everything; people use the cheapest-first so that if they screw up halfway through and have to toss it, they haven't wasted the most expensive ingredients. Not usually an issue when you're making yourself a leisurely drink at home, but a good rule of thumb in a high-throughput bar where they don't measure stuff."
cocktails,3aotyh,countbase,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah but he said ""eggs are the last ingredient"". Unless he meant when the recipe called for it?  Oh it comes out in a dash? Like its not a continuous flow?  I didn't know you need to store it in the fridge! I had it neat at room temp and I wouldn't call it cloying per se.  Good to know about the jiggers.  So is bitters, vermouth, rye, ice, stir, serve a safe order of operations?"
cocktails,3aotyh,5rc8t,2,Tue Jun 23 06:59:31 2015 UTC,"Yes. Eggs are the last ingredient in recipes that call for eggs. A Manhattan never contains eggs.  Yep, bitters bottles are designed for dashing. If a recipe calls for a dash of some other ingredient (absinthe, curacao etc.), then it's kind of up to interpretation, but you probably want a small fraction of a teaspoon.  Yes, that order of operations is fine. The order really doesn't matter for this drink if you measure things carefully and stir well.  You might want to watch some cocktail videos on YouTube; it'll clear up a lot of these kinds of questions.

Who knows how accurate Google was in categorizing American English vs British English books but unless you actually have data to the contrary your point has no merit. It' is however pretty clear the word whiskey and whisky were both used often in books of both dialects until fairly recently which would seem to correlate well to actual usage during those times. I would think a hypothetical book on scotch from the 1700s using the word whisky but written in American dialect wouldn't happen often enough to significantly influence the data especially considering the large sample size

cocktails,3ajiri,WhatWouldJohnWayneDo,5,Sat Jun 20 20:27:05 2015 UTC,"It's a very different, and IMO much better, drink with Old Tom gin.  My recommended recipe:  2oz Old Tom gin (I use Ransom) 1oz Sweet vermouth (I use Carpano Antica) 1/4 oz Maraschino 1 dash Ango 1 dash orange bitters (I use a Regans/Fees mix)"
cocktails,3ajiri,stgabe,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:20:13 2015 UTC,I will have to try.  How does  Old Tom compare with Tanqeruay or Plymouth?
cocktails,3ajiri,stgabe,3,Sun Jun 21 05:28:51 2015 UTC,"Try Old Tom and Tanqueray/Plymouth side-by-side if you can (and throw in a taste of Genever) as it's well worth tasting the difference directly.  I'm sipping on some Ransom Old Tom and Plymouth while I write this.  Ransom Old Tom brings a much richer, more complex flavor.  The nose is very herbal.  That continues through to the initial taste then breaks out into the juniper-forward flavor that you expect from Gin and continues into a dry, lingering finish.  The mouthfeel is also a bit maltier and thicker, though not quite what you'll get from Genever.  In comparison Tanqueray has a direct and bright juniper and citrus flavor that I love for some cocktails but, IMO, clashes a bit with the vermouth and maraschino in a Martinez, which want a little more time to settle on the palate.  The Old Tom version of a Martinez has a more lingering and complex flavor that I prefer.  Tranqueray is a better fit for cocktails that are going for a single, crisp flavor; something that needs a big citrus/juniper punch.  FWIW, Old Tom is also what the drink was first made with historically."
cocktails,3ajiri,chernoboggy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:57:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.  I'll have to give it a shot.  I typically only keep one gin on hand (usually Plymouth).  I had some Tanqueray on hand because I like it in my dry martini's.  I'm just starting to like gin, honestly the big juniper'y ones turned me off to it for awhile but I'm open to try them again."

cocktails,3aka4e,on-the-line,5,Sun Jun 21 07:52:38 2015 UTC,"Should try adding an egg white. Bourbon, lemon juice, syrup, and egg white in a shaker (NO ICE).

cocktails,3aka4e,DistinguishedSpirits,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:56:01 2015 UTC,Does the egg white diminish the intensity of the other flavors?  I'm guessing I'm going to have to add more lemon etc?
cocktails,3aka4e,PeterPanPulse,2,Sun Jun 21 17:43:16 2015 UTC,"I've found that with some drinks it just works, and others you need to add more of the other stuff. My recipe is 2 oz bourbon, 5/8 oz lemon juice, 3/4 oz simple syrup, 1 egg white, so pretty close to your quantities of the other ingredients. You might want to add a little more bourbon and lemon juice (probably don't need much more sugar)."
cocktails,3aka4e,geoalgon,2,Sun Jun 21 17:56:22 2015 UTC,I never use more than .5 simple but upvotes for egg white in a sour all day.
cocktails,3aka4e,Indesertum,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:56:26 2015 UTC,"I second the egg white. It doesn't really change the flavor, it's there for the texture. It gives the drink the creaminess of a Guinness.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWeCefJj-T0"
cocktails,3aka4e,PocketNicks,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:28:21 2015 UTC,"That's a Gold Rush, technically. But, that's a stupid rule anyway.   Egg white does not change the flavor of a cocktail (if fresh), except that it can add a little extra dilution if not prepared properly (no need to overdo it). Considering the booziness of your build, if that's your taste, you'll be fine. But, if I were making it, I'd bump the lemon to .75 (or adding .25 lime instead (more depth in the citrus profile)) and the Honey-simple to .5. Is there a specific reason you use Boker's? The cardamom and eucalyptus notes of Boker's do indeed like playing with honey and lemon, but would drastically change the flavor profile.   Try 2:1 demerara sugar for something a bit deeper."
cocktails,3aka4e,dagurb,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:11:27 2015 UTC,"I use bokers because I like how it tastes in the drink. :-)  I've tried demerara, prefer honey syrup."

cocktails,3agprb,TableTopJosephine,4,Sat Jun 20 01:27:47 2015 UTC,"On the very top of the drink, I layered Bacardi 151 Rum and it lit it. Just make sure the rum is warm or hot. It lights waaaaaaay easier that way."
cocktails,3agprb,treitter,3,Sat Jun 20 01:52:55 2015 UTC,The minimum proof to light a drink on fire is surprisingly high. I made Charles Dickens Punch which involves lighting a tablespoon of high-proof rum (I used 151 as well) and dropping it into the punch to light it on fire. It took many tries and I think it only worked in the end because the strength of the punch had gotten high enough.
cocktails,3agprb,BarBug,3,Sat Jun 20 14:24:10 2015 UTC,80-proof liquor will light as long as it's 79°F (26°C) or hotter. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distilled_beverage see flammability.
cocktails,3agprb,treitter,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"I thought I tried lighting navy-proof rum a come times before giving up and switching to 151 as the ""starter"" but maybe not. Obviously, the punch was much lower than 80-proof to start, so it made sense that some flaming liquid dropped a few inches into it had trouble igniting it."
cocktails,3agprb,BarBug,2,Sun Jun 21 01:00:57 2015 UTC,"Also, it's rare that your 80-proof drink is that warm to start with. That's why the Blue Blazer has to be boiled before it will light. (Don't attempt a Blue Blazer without insurance)"
cocktails,3agprb,Getpucked,2,Sun Jun 21 01:53:17 2015 UTC,Anything 90 proof or more should light
cocktails,3agprb,MaxPecktacular,2,Sat Jun 20 15:51:51 2015 UTC,TBH. I dont know that I've ever lit anything besides 151 on fire for a drink. I also can still count the number of times I've done it on one hand.  We had exactly one night in college where my buddies and I decided to be pyros lol.
cocktails,3agprb,Meltz014,2,Sat Jun 20 06:45:35 2015 UTC,I've lit a few things on fire because I was trying to get more familiar with flaming cocktails.

cocktails,3ab8r1,ykraiina,8,Thu Jun 18 18:17:08 2015 UTC,"Balance is key. For sours the formula is 1.5-2 oz of strong, .75 sweet, and .75 to 1 of sour. Mix and match within that formula, and add modifiers to make different drinks (like bitters, campari, muddled fruit, herbs, etc).  Most other drinks are derivative of classics, like manhattans, old fashions, negronis, etc. Just learn the base recipes and experiment from there.   Oh, and buy quality shit. No matter how solid a recipe may be, a drink with something like Taaka is gonna taste terrible."
cocktails,3ab8r1,Tiajuana-trashbag,2,Thu Jun 18 18:50:44 2015 UTC,"Right on. I thought I'd add this in support of your comment, /u/tiajuana-trashbag:  I use 2 ratios of sweet:sour:strong to start with -- 1:1:2 and 1:2:3 -- in each of those, notice that the sour/sweet total amount and the alcohol total amount are balanced, but the the sour-to-sweet (favoring sour at one end and balance on the other) can change. If you then take this whole amount/ratio and then add an equal amount of weak, you get the generic Punch ratio: 1:2:3:4 (though sweet/sour are inverted). There's the secret to base any math on. Mix that math with knowledge of what flavors go well together and how flavor theory works and bam: you're a 'mixologist.'"
cocktails,3ab8r1,ColonelTiki,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:56:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tips! Are there a list of bitters I should have?
cocktails,3ab8r1,Indesertum,2,Thu Jun 18 23:58:28 2015 UTC,just start with the basics.   cocktail bitters - if you drink a lot of sazeracs and vieux carres get peychaud's. if you drink a lot of martinis get some fee's orange bitters. but since you're just starting out you could just get angosturas and use it for everything.  digestif bitters - get campari. try any kind of fernet at a bar and buy if you like.
cocktails,3ab8r1,Tiajuana-trashbag,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:07:52 2015 UTC,"The only must have is Angostura (which can be added to almost anything) and arguably Peychauds. Its just personal preference beyond that.   Think of bitters as the spice of a cocktail...not all dishes need them, but adding the right one can take your meal to another level. They're fun to make too (especially if you have a SO to do it with or friends to gift them to). Pick up the book ""Bitters"" for recipes."
cocktails,3ab8r1,agusohyeah,4,Fri Jun 19 11:48:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, this is a very broad question. I'm sure the sub's community (and myself) would be glad to help you out, but maybe if you did a little research on the sub (there are threads like this popping up every few days) or tell us the type of cocktails you like or think you like, or what you're aiming to do. Maybe you wanna do cocktails for yourself, your SO, classic, tiki, or maybe you just wanna experiment everything, all over the place, and that's fun and great too but the answers to your questions will be different depending on that."
cocktails,3ab8r1,agusohyeah,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:04:27 2015 UTC,"Sorry about the broadness of the question. Didn't know this sub existed until recently and have just been lurking around. Thanks for the pointers. Im just looking to experiment everything, I am a fan of adventurous cocktails."
cocktails,3ab8r1,Indesertum,4,Thu Jun 18 23:59:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, cool, just to know what you were looking to get out of this. So, if you wanna experiment I think you'll have to start by the classics and then venture into other areas. I started like that, with the classics, then bought bottles one by one, experimented with them, finished them or kept them for the one or two cocktails I liked, rinse and repeat. Might not be the best option though.  What I think you should do is start with the basics then. A bottle of dry gin (beefeaters, bombay, tanqueray, whatever your budget allows) and maybe if you can spare it a more herbal gin (hendrick's, botanits, st george). If you can't afford a herbal gin just yet it's ok.  vermouth rosso and  dry are musts for classic cocktail making. Dolin, Noilly prat, Carpano if you can afford it. You can buy 375 cl. bottles instead of the big ones. Even Martini, or Cinzano (martini gets a lot of hate here, you can do your own experience. Vermouth in particular is pretty cheap so you can go for the more middle shelf stuff more easily than other spirits). By the way, vermouth is basically fortified and spiced wine, so once you open the bottle you should refrigerate it, if not it'll go bad sort of like wine that spoils and turns to vinegar after a couple days. A vermouth bottle in the fridge will be good for 4 months, easily. You should also buy a bottle of rye, bulleit is cheap and good in my opinion. bourbon too, thing with them is that they are pretty much substitutes but bourbon is sweet and rye is dry and spicy. Any recipe that calls for one can be subbed (substituted) for the other, but it'll be a very different drink, although still enjoyable. I think campari is a must, basically because you need it for a negroni, which is a classic drink. It's an acquired taste, many people find it too bitter. If you do, drink it with orange juice or tonic water until you understand it. You also have Aperol, very very similar to campari but sweeter, but if you learn to love campari you're well on your way. You can also buy a cheap and good white rum (flor de caña 4) and maybe another rum (flor de caña 7 maybe? i don't know that much about rums). That should get you pretty covered for a very first purchase, like absolute first.  another key ingredient is bitters. You might've seen them, very small bottles, used in short dashes or even drops. they are very concentrated reductions, very very strong (and alcoholic, althought they are used in such small doses that their alcohol content doesn't influence the drink, it's more about the taste). The first bitter you should absolutely get is Angostura bitters (other brands sell angostura knockoff as ""aromatic bitters"", angostura is the brand here and is the one you should get). Once you've started experimenting you can get a few more, orange is the second bitter any beginner should get (Reagan's Orange Bitters is really good) and then just go crazy. The bitters either enhance or complement a flavour. You can do a Manhattan with bourbon and a chocolatey or vanillaey vermouth, throw in a few dashes of chocolate bitters and it'll be like a liquid dessert, or you can use a herbal gin in a gin and tonic, throw in a couple dashes of say lavender bitters and it'll suddenly become really complex.  now for gear. You'll need a jigger, the little measuring cup. They usually come in a 1 oz - 1/2 oz combination. The thing you need to know is that recipes many times give you oz. measurments, but the thing is that you should use that as a guide in proportions. For instance, a classic manhattan is 2 oz. rye (or bourbon) and 1 oz vermouth (plus 2 dashes of angostura bitters). This doesn't mean you have to do it like that, a 3 oz cocktail. you can do 1 oz and 1/2, or 2 buckets and 1 bucket, 2 swimming pools of rye and 1 swimming pool of vermouth, the thing is always to maintain the proportion. You'll find recipes in fractions or ounces. I find it easier to always convert them to fractions (12.5 cl of X thing and 5 of y? 2 1/2 x and 1 of y). You'll also need a shaker. You can get one of those that has two main pieces and the top that can be sort of unscrewed and you have a strainer there (basically just a lot of holes). You can use one of those and avoid buying a strainer (for now). If you can't/don't wanna buy one, just use a jam or mayonnaise jar. seriously, it's just as effective. You should get a good spoon though, a long spoon that's flat and rather big, but mostly that feels comfortable. The basic movement is doing a circle with your thumb and index or major finger and keep it loosely inside the cirle and stir. the spoon should move freely and feel it can move inside that circle. If you can get good or varied glassware, cool. One martini glass, one whisky glass, one tall glass, etc. If you can't just yet, it's cool.  Now for techniques. Basically you have two: shaking and stirring. Whenever the recipe calls for just spirits (I'll consider bitters spirits for this) you just gotta stir. What's stirring? you measure the ingredients (proportions!) with the jigger and pour them in a mixing glass (another thing you should get, basically a ver big, open glass, but if you can't, the big ""glass"" of the shaker is good enough), you dump 3 4 ices and stir for 20 seconds or so. then you strain it (you can use a strainer, if you bought one, or something that makeshifts as a strainer, you basically don't want the ices falling on the glass). That's it. Now, if you're gonna use fruit juices or syrups, or eggs, you wanna shake. This will help the liquids with different densities mix well. If you shake a cocktail that only has spirits and no juice two bad things'll happen: they'll get ice shards and they'll get too much oxygen, becoming cloudy and won't taste well. However, if your recipe calls for juice and liquor, shake it. No particular technique for shaking, just feel that the ices are moving as much as you can inside the shaker.  Glasses can either be chilled, or filled with ice. That depends on the drink. some drinks are poured stirred and pour on an ice filled glass, some shaken and poured on an ice (or crushed ice) filled glass, some are on a chilled glass. A good cheat code for chilling glasses is coating them in water and putting them in the freezer for a couple minutes. When you pour the cocktail in them it'll keep cold for a long time without being diluted by ice.  That'll be in the recipe (e.g. ""strain into a chilled glass""). Some cocktails benefit from the ice, in the sense that as they become more diluted more flavors open up or they become more ""drinkable"" (like the Old Fashioned), others would taste good the first minutes and then with the dilution would taste bad (e.g. if you poured a Manhattan in an ice filled glass).  As far as books go, I only have the Death&Co book. It's really good if you wanna know how to run a bar and learn techniques, but uses a very wide variety of spirits, so I wouldn't recommend it just yet. What I did when I began was going to www.diffordsguide.com and sort cocktails by spirit and rating. So I'd see a bottle of amaro averna, buy it, and go there and see good recipes, try all of them, write down the ones I like. You can't try a full cocktail of all of them, but since you know you need to use proportions you can even use spoonfuls (going back to the manhattan, just 2 spoonfuls of rye and one of vermouth plus 3 drops of bitters is good enough of a parameter).  Now, you mention you like ordering cocktails. Go up to the bar, sit there if you're alone, excuse yourself if you're with someone, and watch. You'll see how the barman measures, shakes, stirs, how he garnishes a drink, etc. Ask him, in my experience barmen are always willing to explain, and even more if you say you're an amateur. don't be afraid to ask dumb questions, you can explain why you ask them (for instance ""I learnt you should only shake cocktails with fruit juice, why are you shaking this one?"" and they'll answer ""because it has egg white, and it needs to be shaken"", for instance). YOu can learn a lot just watching, especially in terms of garnishes, stirring and shaking techniques.  Another piece of advice is try the cocktail at every step. Imagine you're gonna prepare a Negroni. You start with 1 oz gin. You can smell it, taste a spoonful, whatever. Then you add 1 oz of vermouth. Stir it a little, or use a straw, and taste it. Straight into your mouth or swipe it in the flesh fold that forms between your thumb and index, and lick it. Try to taste what has been added. Then you add 1 oz of campari. Stir, do the same thing, try to taste what's new. Usually it's a very gut instinct, you'll taste it and say ""sour"", ""bitter"", ""alcoholic"", ""wood"", and that's good! it sort of boils down to that.  Finally, don't be discouraged by anything. This sub is really polite and helpful, but even here (although mostly outside) you'll find people being elitist about some subjects. Many craft cocktail bartenders will look down on you or refuse serving you a strawberry daiquiri, or something with red bull. are they right? I don't know, I think they are, but whatever. depends on what you wanna get from the hobby. If after a long day at work you wanna whip up a strawberry daikiri, and most importantly you have fun doing it then it's cool!. However, you should try to keep an open mind in understanding stuff that has a physical/chemical/whatever basis behind it. For instance, you might say ""I love my Negronis shaken"" but somebody might tell you ""hey, ok, but negronis are made with 3 spirits, no juice, no syrup. if youshake it you'll get ice shards in it, you'll get it aereated and cloudy, and the drink will take poorly"", and they'll be right, so you'll might have to accept that some things are made some way. HOWEVER, if you love shaken negronis, they make you relax, enojy your return home, etc. by all means do it. if you're not gonna bartend, explore and enjoy. if you have any question whatsoever hit me up or ask here, I've learnt a ton in this sub."
cocktails,3ab8r1,agusohyeah,2,Fri Jun 19 04:47:46 2015 UTC,"great information   but you're being elitist about shaking vs stirring. in the 1800s the manhattan was regularly ordered both stirred and shaken. Jerry Thomas for example said to shake the manhattan. The cloudiness dissipates after 30 seconds. also cloudiness, tasting bad, and preference for ice shards is pretty subjective and more of an aesthetic preference. You can also double strain to get rid of ice shards just like you would with any other shaken drink. neither is a more correct method, but one is a more popular one  also bourbons aren't sweeter than rye. FWIU the distillation process leaves sugars behind so the all final products of distillation contain no sugar"
cocktails,3ab8r1,Indesertum,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"Hm I didn't know that, maybe I shouldn't have said it but I figured as a rule of thumb and for someone doing his first steps it'd be better. Out of curiosity, do you shake any cocktail that's traditionally stirred?  well yeah, it might not have sugar but I think it does taste sweeter."
cocktails,3ab8r1,agusohyeah,2,Sun Jun 21 07:29:04 2015 UTC,i like manhattans and negronis both shaken and stirred. shaking is a lot easier initially but cleanup is more annoying. i think they're different (predominantly the texture) not better or worse.  i've always wondered where the sweetness perception comes from cuz it's not from sugar. maybe it's one of the types of alcohol.
cocktails,3ab8r1,Indesertum,2,Sun Jun 21 20:36:48 2015 UTC,"yeah or maybe the flavors, like I often find banana in bourbons (along with vanilla and caramel), so even if it isn't sweet per se I make a connection with sweet things.  I'm open to everything so I'll shake my next manhattan and see what comes of it."
cocktails,3ab8r1,shitcock55,2,Sun Jun 21 21:00:04 2015 UTC,"fwiu ethanol itself has a slightly sweet taste to it. i wonder if the different types of alcohol in rye vs bourbon makes bourbon taste a little sweeter even without a little sugar (especially in people have sugar sensitive palates). so i guess you could actually be tasting sweet even if there is no sugar  if you want to try jerry thomas's manhattan (i can't say definitely that it's the oldest known recipes, but it's for sure one of the oldest) it's:    2 dashes curacao or maraschino  30 mL rye 50 mL sweet vermouth 3 dashes bitters shaken with a lemon wedge as a garnish   he also says if the customer likes it really sweet you should add 2 dashes of gum syrup which also helps a lot with the texture especially when shaken  imo the recipe is a little too sweet for my taste. i also like it shaken with classic proportions (like 3:1) with a dash of maraschino liqeur. heretical by today's standards.  watch this hess video on the subject (he prefers it stirred)  i do have to say i was being rather impolite and pedantic because i'm only aware of like 1 or 2 other ancient shaken recipes. everybody else says stirred, but i guess my point was some people used to like it shaken 150 years ago too"

I've found in general that dried is easier if you're trying to get the floral flavor into a syrup, but it can be a little overpowering and bitter when done through a NO2 gun infusion. However, fresh lavender usually gives me the opposite results, a more bitter and vegetal tone in syrups, and a much lighter and fully floral character when infused."

Note that the way drinks are counted in the films on this site varies slightly from the way that they are on the infographic: for instance, one credits Bond with drinking port, the other with red wine (looking at the scene I can't tell, but after dinner one would expect it to be port...), and nor does the infographic count the champagne, despite the fact that Bond gets to use possibly the snobbiest line in any of the films to emphasise the fact that they're drinking it..."

A vodka martini, assuming a UK double (50ml: slightly less than 2oz) and 40% vodka, and 12.5ml of M&R Extra Dry (15% ABV) is 2.1875 units. (1.2 US standard drinks).  Thus, at a conservative estimate for how much Bond drank, he consumed 6 units. If he'd had 2oz of vodka in his martini instead, and scaled up the vermouth accordingly at 4:1, he'd have drunk 6.5 units.  If he drank more than half the champagne, or if the vodka was stronger than 40% (Smirnoff was 40%, but e.g. Stolichnaya was available at 50%ABV/100 proof), especially if he had more vermouth in his cocktail, he could easily have broken 7 units.   But most of the confusion comes from the fact that the unit is a UK measurement of alcohol, which is 10ml of pure ethanol.  A US standard drink is 80% more, and in fact the only country with a standard drink smaller than a UK unit listed on wikipedia is Austria..."

cocktails,3a7nm5,caeciliusinhorto,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:22:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, what counts as a ""standard drink"" (and what the terminology for describing it is) varies massively across countries.  A Japanese standard drink contains 25ml of pure ethanol, an Austrian one contains only 7.62ml.   So a single 500ml can of Heineken (at 5%ABV), for instance, is 1 Japanese standard drink, 1.4 US standard drinks, 2.5 UK standard drinks, and 3.2 Austrian standard drinks..."

cocktails,3a8f8c,jeremyjack33,3,Thu Jun 18 03:32:09 2015 UTC,"This is a tough one, and I'll let you know I'm answering as a working bartender.  Definitely make your preference known. There are few motivators stronger for whomever does purchasing than ""people are asking for it"".   Also the good news here is that even good quality vermouth is blindingly cheap. I'd be surprised if you could find anything that costs more than $20 wholesale, so it's not that big of a outlay for the bar.  The other side of the coin is that it's hard for you to know everything that goes into purchasing decisions for the bar. There's a whole host of reasons why bars might carry certain products (price and preference being big ones), and it can sometimes be exasperating when guests lecture you that you should carry this one stupid thing they like (no I will not pick up Beck's Sapphire, Jim Beam Red Stag, or that artisanal small batch tequila that you tried one time but can't remember the name). And of course, it might not even be up to any of the bartenders at all!  So definitely say something! Make your preferences known! But keep in mind that there are lots of factors at work here and don't guilt trip your bartender about it."

cocktails,3a8f8c,Antilon,7,Thu Jun 18 02:06:01 2015 UTC,"This is a perfect example of an uninformed opinion. More than 90% of the cherries we use at the country club I work at go into ""kiddy cocktails""(bastardized Shirley Temples). There's no reason to put expensive authentic maraschino cherries in these drinks.   Vermouth is another subject altogether. At the end of the day if you don't use vermouth liberally throughout your cocktail list or have a high volume of Manhattan drinkers its just gonna go bad and there really isn't a large difference between a spoiled expensive vermouth and spoiled cheap vermouth. Big distributors don't sell small bottles either so its kind of a difficult situation to work around."
cocktails,3a8f8c,jeremyjack33,2,Thu Jun 18 03:29:16 2015 UTC,I actually disagree. Even kids LOVE Luxardo cherries. You'd be better served by adding them and charging the extra $0.10. I think using quality ingredients in everything you do also leads to a general attitude of quality and will lift the other things too.
cocktails,3a8f8c,funnymaroon,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"You're just explaining why a bar would use shitty ingredients. That doesn't change that a bar using shitty ingredients is going to make shitty drinks.

Spend $15 bucks on Dolin  and gift it to the bar. Ask the bartender to make a Manhattan with the shit vermouth and with the mid grade Dolin. For some extra punch bring a jar of Luxardo cherries and let him taste the difference. It might be worth it to spend $30.

Then steep some chopped rhubarb and let it cool while steeping. By the time the syrup has cool the infusion should be sufficient. I definitely wouldn't expose the rhubarb itself to boiling temperatures. You're right it would definitely change the rhubarb's flavor in the liqueur.  Another alternative is to infuse the Rhubarb into whatever spirit you choose to make the base for your liqueur. Good luck my friend, let me know how it comes out."

I juiced the pea pods in a Vitamix with a bit of water and a good measure of effort. The added syrup and schnapps are to restore some of the consistency and sweetness lost in this process.

The main thing is that the cocktail should be served with the same ice that it's shaken with.  For this drink I wouldn't even use cold draft if I had the option, instead opting for softer ice that will break up more easily.  Cobbled ice would work well if you really wanted to strain it over something; but authentically speaking, you should muddle, shake, and then pour everything into the glass you are drinking from.  You want shards of ice, all different sizes, bits of lime pulp floating around....really makes the drink!"

I keep a bottle of Cruzan Blackstrap around. It has a very distinctive molasses flavor that is crucial to that drink as a balance to the Campari. Having tried it both ways, picking up a bottle of blackstrap is definitely worth it."

cocktails,39zxlo,little_fatty,2,Tue Jun 16 14:55:52 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid that my comment will be seen in a negative light - but I wanted to point out that ""Dark Rum"" doesn't really mean anything. I would dissuade you from using that term or the idea that there is this ""thing"" called ""Dark Rum"" as a style or type of rum. It is merely descriptive.  Most times, when a recipe calls for ""Dark Rum"" they mean aged Jamaica (depending on the recipe).  For example, A Skippers ""dark"" is from demerara rum and it tastes completely different from Pussers. Either of them are completely 'different' rums than a Jamaica Rum.   When rums are blended, it is for the characteristics of each rum and the color/appearance can be in conflict.  I would suggest you think of rum mixes that already exist if you want to get into a custom mix for your house rum, and understand when which recipe calls for which rum. Dark Jamaica = just use Coruba, except for the Coconaut - use Meyers for that and only that.  For mixing, look into the Jamaica(funk)/Demerara(spice/wood)/Cuban-VirginIslands(Florals, heat) mix of a Navy Grog - Coruba, El Dorado, Cruzan."
cocktails,39zxlo,Wh1msey,2,Wed Jun 17 00:00:32 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with anything you've said, and mostly I was trying to keep the rum discussion simple, but it seems that is causing the most questions, so I'm happy to dive in.  The rum blend I'm using is 4:2:1:1 - Appleton 12yr, Barbancourt 4yr, S&C, Cruzan Blackstrap. It keeps the dryness of the Appleton while filling out the profile with molasses and funk that I feel like is missing with all the oak in the 12yr. It's a slight variation on my 1:1 - Appleton 12yr, Barbancourt 8yr that I typically use in Mai Tai's, and I feel like it's a bit more flexible.   Mai Tai - This rum was in part built for the way I drink this drink. I love dry drinks, and between the dryness of the Appleton 12yr and the Pierre Ferrand Curacao, I can control the exact sweetness w/ simple while layering on flavor w/ the S&C and blackstrap.  Painkiller - I should get Pusser's. There's no argument here, and I might as well use it as an excuse to get a bottle. (I think cream of coconut kills most rum details, personally)  Jungle Bird typically gets Black Seal if I'm making it for myself, because I like the Campari to cut through strong (thus the 3oz of pineapple instead of 4). The blend works solidly, because the extra molasses from the blackstrap cuts through as suggested above, but the dryness of the Appleton 12yr works well with the sweetness from the pineapple and Campari.  In BooLoo, I'd love to have Coruba to add a different brown sugar note, but sadly no distribution on that. Without the blend, I'd probably go w/ either Blackwell (vanilla/light molasses) or Black Seal. The other rums would be El Dorado 5yr, Cruzan 5yr dark, and Lemonhart 151 btw.  Coconaut doesn't really care what rum you throw at it, as the cream of coconut eats most of the complexity. Nothing w/ too much vanilla, but Coruba (brown sugar) or Goslings (molasses) would both stand up fine, especially w/ a punchy ounce of Cruzan blackstrap. I'm probably overkilling by using the blend in it, and will honestly grab a bottle of black seal to throw at it, depending on how many are requested."

A well-made whisky sour is always fabulous. You could probably try it with the peach whisky too, though I'm not a fan of flavored whisky, so that might also be terrible. That's the joy of exploring new cocktails, though. Sometimes you make things and they're shit, but then you can improve. Also, how you're drinking the peach whisky now sounds good.  Anyway, you can also start trying out different things to mix with. If you're liking the whisky, bitters are fun, and you can try different vermouths with things. /r/bitters is a good starting point, and there are some cool online shops where you can buy sample sets of different kinds.There are also tons of great things to mix with gin - shrubs, liqueurs, different kinds of simple syrup."

I saw someone on here made falernum recently, so I looked it up and the site I found listed Mai Tais as a cocktail that it can be used in.  Slow cookers are the ""theme"" of the party, so everything - appetizers, sides, main dish, dessert, and drinks - need to be made with a slow cooker in some capacity. The drinks don't have to be served hot - I'd prefer them to be cold! -  but a slow cooker/crock pot does have to be involved at some point in making it, so I am racking my brain trying to figure out how to use one here."

cocktails,39y5ej,TacosAreJustice,2,Mon Jun 15 21:24:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with kosmo_theoros, why are you doing something that is traditionally used for northern cold weather months for food (a slow cooker) for a cocktail. It makes no sense, and I'm in Chicago and was just in Texas a week ago.  You need cool and refreshing drinks, although I've never used a slow cooker to prep them.  All I can think of that I use heat for is a simple syrup, you can throw mint (or basil, for more savory at the end for something Bloody Mary's and let it steep).  Another of my favorites is basically a summertime punch of lemon or lime juice and sugar with a puree of mint, strawberries and lemon/lime juice. Mix it to your booze/fruit/sweetness level and it's fantastic. It's basically a good  Strawberry Mojito mix that you can mix up before hand,  Throw that mint syrup into some mojitos or juleps."

cocktails,39y5ej,anifail,2,Mon Jun 15 20:48:30 2015 UTC,Make a simple syrup in the slow cooker. Then you can use that in a variety of cocktails.   One idea (based off of Jeffrey Morgenthaler's recipe) . Heat a cup of water in the cooker. You don't want to boil it. Take 2 packets (6oz each) of raspberries (or similar fruit) and put it in the water until the colour of the water is the same as the fruit. Strain out the fruit through a coffee filter. Then while still warm mix in one cup of sugar with the water.

You could always booze it up with some gin, white rum, or vodka, essentially giving you a variation on a Tom Collins.  Another option: a Mojito with some cilantro in addition to the mint.

The idea behind the banana is purely phallic. Its supposed to be some sort of aphrodisiac, because trying to drink a beverage with a whole banana is overtly sexual and also hilarious. If you can't laugh at the fact that you're trying to maneuver around a penis while drinking the drink, then you ""aren't a suitable mate"".  Also, its actually delicious. The acidity from the wine cuts through the eggy custard of the (egg liqueur / dessert, depending on what you use) and makes a shockingly tasty pairing. Traditionally the egg mixture is egg yolks beaten with sugar and chopped walnuts. The protein is to help you perform. The liqueur works well if you don't want to go through the effort. You can probably do without the banana as well, and it'd still taste good.  Here's a photo I found."

Not necessarily reviews or critiques, but see which ones are successful to get an idea of what people visit.  Constructive feedback: I would be wary of a 23 year old judging cocktails for me. This is a generalization without knowing anything about you, but several factors would lead me to be wary of your opinion including not many years of actual drinking, the assumed amount of money you make in order to have experienced quality alcohols, plus the assumed drinking culture a 23 year old has lived in. Now, great taste and better writing can negate all of these things, but from my perspective, you have these things stacked against you with your age. Just being honest.  For your site, I'd like a guide based on specific drinks (which bar has the best Manhattan) which uses the freshest ingredients, the most varied ingredients, most innovative ingredients, etc. A bar may have a huge collection of whiskeys, but hardly uses any fresh ingredients and they have no interesting bitters on the shelves. What does that mean to you? To the audience?  I'd want descriptive vocabulary. I want to learn new ways to articulate my drinking experience, from the taste obviously but also the smells, the texture of the liquid, and then the ambiance of the bar.  It's a fine line between making judgement and sounding pretentious. If your reviews sound unfair/biased/not grounded in balanced analysis, readers will notice that right away.   I say go for it.

It so happens that I am no stranger to ageism, being in the tech industry and working with people much much my senior has always proved difficult as most judge age before character.   Comparisons between bars regarding specific drinks is a very good idea. Maybe someone makes a sub-par negroni but makes the best whiskey sour in town, you never know.   Inquiry regarding ingredients is also a very good idea. Although it is very important to me that my food is local, I've never truly thought about drink ingredients being local (aside from always trying to find local bitters and spirits for my home experimentation).  I have red countless books and blogs regarding cocktail making, history and critiquing but I do think my ability to paint a palatable picture could improve with more.

Maybe if you gain a following, then you can start to ""warn"" people of bad bars.  The thing is, people want to hear good things. You will alienate yourself from the bartenders and bar owners if you write poorly of them when you're first starting out. Plus, people who are looking for bars to try care more about good bars than they care about bad bars.   I think a lot of people who blog/critique/whatever just want to throw their negative opinions around. Its the same thought behind the addage that people who have a bad experience are more likely to leave reviews places.   Be happy. Be positive. Have a good photographer."

I realized most people aren't curious in the same ways I am (not asking questions) and would never know that they can get an excellent drink right buy their place. The city currently doesn't have a ""Go here for a good cocktail"" website and requires a lot of trial and error which can discourage new comers who aren't as resilient or have as much free time and energy.

This doesn't seem very effective; air is a poor conductor of heat, so the ice is only going to cool the bottom of the glass by melting slightly. Wouldn't it be better to add some water along with the ice? (And then toss it and add fresh ice before pouring in the cocktail.) Or just throw the glass in the freezer for a few minutes, coated with a wet paper towel if you're in a rush."

cocktails,39ud3a,Guazzabuglio,3,Sun Jun 14 21:28:29 2015 UTC,"Bourbon and rye both work in a lot of the basic whiskey cocktails like the Old Fashioned or the Manhattan.  A rye sour is a little weird, but can be nice.  Keep in mind that the drinks are going to be really, really different, as bourbon and rye have quite dissimilar flavor profiles.  You should get better gin.  Gin is my favorite spirit, but I am not a fan of Namsterdam.  Beefeater and Tanq aren't too expensive and are such a step up.  Shakers are pretty essential for a lot of drinks.  Even when they aren't totally necessary, they can still help - for example, dry shaking a White Russian really helps integrate the cream and prevents any congealing.  You'll probably want to shake just about anything with fresh citrus.  Go for a Boston shaker and Hawthorne strainer, they're simple and effective.  A slight price bump goes a long way when it comes to vermouth.  Dolin is just a couple bucks more a bottle than M&R where I live and makes such a better martini/manhattan.  The Bar Book by Jeffery Morgenthaler is a fantastic resource for people new to mixing drinks.  You'll learn a lot about proper technique.  Best hobby ever, have fun and experiment!"
cocktails,39ud3a,sultanofswag69,4,Mon Jun 15 01:05:20 2015 UTC,"2nd the gin and vermouth upgrades. Upgrading both of those ingredients will make such better cocktails. I like beefeater as my go to gin, and I use Plymouth for aviations. Dolin is my favorite vermouth too."
cocktails,39ud3a,PuckDaFackers,3,Mon Jun 15 03:45:18 2015 UTC,"Get a peeler or bar knife so you can take the skin off citrus fruits.  I only use a shaker and it's top when I mix drinks.  I do not use a strainer because it almost always leads to ice shards in the drink(like the martini)  Bourbon:  I stock Blanton's, Bulleit and Jefferson Reserve.   Vodka:  Chopin Potato Vodka(for martini's), Imperia, and Stolichnaya 100 proof   For vermouth I tend to favor Dolin.  The only other spirits I would pick up are    Another Gin brand.... like Bluecoat or Nolet's  Tequila---I love Milagro  St. Germain  Aperol  Chambord  A single malt scotch(your choice.... see r/scotch for taste reviews)   EDIT:   Oh got to mention Herbsaint, so you can at least make the famous Sazerac."

cocktails,39ud3a,thatguy8856,3,Mon Jun 15 06:09:02 2015 UTC,"try entering what you have into CocktailBuilder.com, and it'll populate a list of drinks you can make. it will then give you a short ""shopping list"" of the top 5 ingredients that you could buy that would allow you to make the most other cocktails in addition to what you have. It also makes a large list of what cocktails you are very close to being able to make. Be sure to enter simples as well (water, sugar, simple syrup, eggs etc. to give a more accurate list)  Now that that's over, if you wanna mix you'll need a shaker eventually- I always recommend a simple Boston shaker (1 or 2 metal cups, depending on type). But for what to stock, start with your own curiosity- what flavors interest you? What textures? You don't need to be able to make EVERY drink, and not every 'famous and essential' or 'top ten' cocktail  will be to your liking, or your guests'."

cocktails,39ud3a,zeke333,2,Mon Jun 15 13:18:38 2015 UTC,"Bourbon and rye are NOT interchangeable.  Sure they will often produce a nice drink (I enjoy both in an Old Fashioned or a sour) but it will be two very different drinks.  Scotch sour would be drinkable but odd.  Scotch isn't that popular in cocktails, it doesn't play well with others.  For books it's a great time to be alive. Consider Morgenthaler's ""The Bar Book"" for technique.  Yes you need a shaker."
cocktails,39ud3a,BSRussell,2,Mon Jun 15 15:02:58 2015 UTC,"New Amsterdam is a good cheap and tasty gin, and I enjoy it with soda water, but it's not the best for cocktails. If you want to stick with the same price point, try Gordon's. If you want to spend a bit more, Beefeater or Tanqueray are good picks. Personally, I always have New Amsterdam (for gin and sodas) and Gordon's (for cocktails), in addition to a few ""fancier"" gins (favorites are Uncle Val's and Farmer's) for when the mood strikes... but I do love gin.   As already mentioned, yes you need a shaker, but a shaker tin and pint glass are very cheap and easy to use.   A tip for experimenting: learn ratios, not ""recipes"" necessarily. Learning that a martini and a Manhattan are essentially the same drink, or a margarita and a lemon drop, or a Brandy Alexander and a White Russian, etc etc, will both help you remember how to make drinks as well as give you tried and true guidelines to base your own experiments off of."
cocktails,39ud3a,lisomiso,2,Mon Jun 15 16:24:40 2015 UTC,"Bourbon and rye are interchangeable in the sense that you can grab a recipe that has one of those and sub it for the other and in the same proportion, you'll get a drinkable cocktail but it'll be really different. Bourbon is really sweet and rye is usually spicy. It isn't a bad thing, where I live I can't get rye so for a couple years I did everything with bourbon until I could get a bottle of rye from outside.  There are few scotch cocktails, the only two I can remember doing are rusty nails (2 parts blended scotch 1 drambuie) and scotch, honey, lemon and ginger. Sometimes islay single malt scotch is used, it's a very very smoky scotch (category of scotches, rather, there are more or less 9 distilleries in islay) and you use a spoonful or 1/4 oz. Penicillin is a great cocktail that uses islay single malt and blended scotch.  I have Death&Co's book lots of recipes (but you'd need a huge bar, in each section they use a different brand for every cocktail or so it seems), but has a good section on  shaking and mixing techniques, ice, glassware, and it also details the daily life in a bar that's really fun, if you like bars. Liquid Intelligence is next on my to buy list.  Rule of thumb is you need shakers for anything using simple syrup and/or fruit juices and stir anything with only spirits. If you don't wanna buy one a jam or mayonnaise jar can do the job. When you do anything with egg white you should, usually, first dry shake (that means just the ingredients, no ice) everything, and then add the ice and shake for a second time. This will emulsify the cocktail, meaning it'll be creamier and frothier.  I'd suggest buying a white rum (flor de caña 4, cheap and really good) for daiquiris and mojitos, having a dry gin and a gin leaning towards the herbal, softer flavors (I've never had new amsterdam so idk what category it's in), st germain as someone mentioned (it goes well with pretty much anything it's in, mostly gin but vodka and fruitier things like that pear liqueur you have would really work, you could experiment as a first cocktail created by yourself something gin or  vodka based, st germain and pear), and campari (or aperol if you've never had campari, although i'd really suggest you start trying it to develop the taste. I loved it instantly but many people find it hard to like. However, a basic drink you need to know, and excellent to experiment on is negroni: 1 part gin, 1 campari, 1 vermouth. You can then sub the gin for bourbon, rye, genever, the vermouth for regular wine, half rosso half dry, campari for aperol, it's a really good cocktail to understand what you said about ""teaching about the flavours"".  Finally, for the next step, once you're done playing with the basics, look into buying green chartreuse and benedictine DOM, those could be good for intermediate cocktails.  You had really good adivce given here but hit me up if you wanna know anything else."

You two have been together for a while now, the initial infatuation has worn off, and while you don't love each other any less, your relationship with cocktails is just maturing, and now you two are getting comfortable; sounds like you need to spice things up a bit. The solution? Just like any other good marriage: bring in a third. You don't have to limit your love to just cocktails. Branch out and get to know other, less popular or more obscure ingredients. Sake, soju, baiju, or Noilly Prat Ambre are a few. Or, dive into Tiki. There is a whole subculture there that has a ton of history and lots of research and information to discover; it's not just about overly sweet drinks, faux polynesian cuisine, and loud hawaiian shirts. Making your own ingredients and really getting down into the nitty gritty is a good idea, also. Not only will it give you even more control over your drinks, it also shows you what goes into making a quality product and, I think, gives you more of an appreciation for all the quality producers out there."

Think of a cool name and base a cocktail around it, create a backronym of ingredients from a name and use those ingredients to make a drink, try something that you think is ridiculous, buy a new serving vessel that expands your options - you just might surprise yourself."

I think the one thing that's been annoying me a bit also is that I can taste the sweetness in everything! I had a gin/yellow chartresue drink the other night and it was sickly sweet, not good. I fell back to a martini the other night (my staple!) and it just tasted way too sweet again. Maybe my taste is a bit disjointed at the moment also."
cocktails,39soqs,AldermanMcCheese,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:41:53 2015 UTC,"I find it interesting and exciting to do things that revolve around cocktail making but not the cocktail itself. For instance, have you tried doing syrups? and I don't mean simple, I mean a shit ton of syrups. It's crazy easy to do and you can do it with anything. Lemongrass, ginger, lavender, habanero, earl grey tea, cardamom, whatever can be syruped and, while it won't be usable in many cocktails, it's fun to build a cocktail around it.   Another thing is barrel aging. If you can't afford or don't have space for a barrel, look into buying oak spirals on amazon, they are surprisingly good, as are oak chips. I've been aging negronis non stop for the past 8 months in the same barrel and I they still come out incredibly good.  FInally, you could try infusions. Rye and gin are my go to's, but vodka should work. I've been infusing with tea mostly, but you can do rye (or bourbon, rather) with bacon, gin with lavender, etc. The other day I infused bourbon with chai tea (with cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, pepper) and did a manhattan with that and cardamom bitters. It was weird, not what I'm used to and probably won't do it again, but once the idea hit me it was really exciting."

cocktails,39re9h,jakielim,6,Tue Jun 16 20:02:12 2015 UTC,I was mildly disappointed there wasn't a second passable drink. Super entertaining read.

cocktails,39rf7t,eNonsense,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:26:20 2015 UTC,"According to ""The Savoy Cocktail Book,"" this recipe comes from an American engineer who nearly died of fever while working in the Philippines in 1924. In appreciation, he gave this secret recipe to the doctor who saved his life."
cocktails,39rf7t,_wob_,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:04:35 2015 UTC,Some story about a GI giving the recipe to the doctor who saved his life in the Philippines. The usual cocktail lore type things.
cocktails,39rf7t,ExaltedNecrosis,2,Sun Jun 14 18:07:53 2015 UTC,Sounds nice.  But I'm deducting points because you're one of those people that likes spotty bananas.  Nasty.  ; (

cocktails,39rf7t,kylegwyn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:42:21 2015 UTC,"Will try this tomorrow when I have company over.  How do you get your egg white so thick & foamy?   I know people recommend dry shaking it before adding liquid ingredients and shaking with ice, but it seems like it always gets watered down after that and it defeats the purpose of dry shaking."
cocktails,39rf7t,TheKingOfGhana,2,Sun Jun 14 06:38:16 2015 UTC,"It's often recommended to pull the spring off a Hawthorne strainer, if you have one, and toss that in the the shaker. Acts like a whisk to help froth up the egg. Takes a little extra time though to get it set back up for the pour."
cocktails,39rf7t,kylegwyn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:20:41 2015 UTC,I'm really confused what you mean by this.
cocktails,39rf7t,TheKingOfGhana,2,Mon Jun 15 00:11:51 2015 UTC,"This is best example I could find.. around 2:10-2:15 he demonstrates putting the spring in the shaker and explains the reasoning a bit.  If you're unfamiliar with where the spring came from, it's from a hawthorne style strainer. The spring part can easily be pulled off, then reattached when finished. (This is what I meant about it taking more time. You'd need to clean off the spring, then reattach it to the strainer so you can use it to pour the drink.)  ...To be honest though, this isn't really necessary. Personally, I don't add the spring or do a dry shake. I've seen it done, and it's obviously a thing. But, if I'm shaking a whiskey sour with egg white, I typically find I get a decent froth from just a quick, hard, regular old shake over ice."
cocktails,39rf7t,HankSc0rp10,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:22:45 2015 UTC,Ooo okay gotcha. Interesting. And in essay I've found. I just dry shake really hard and get a similar results. Leave it to Hess to always weird it up a notch.
cocktails,39rf7t,nebrija,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:25:57 2015 UTC,"You can also do a reverse dry shake. Where you shake over ice, strain and then dry shake. This prevents the foam from being broken down by the ice after its formed."
cocktails,39rf7t,Scarecrow1779,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:17:13 2015 UTC,"for a whisky sour I dry shake for 3 seconds with the liquid ingredients, then shake with ice. It works perfectly for me."
