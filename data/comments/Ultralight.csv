Ultralight,3e6qy4,HyperliteMGear,7,Wed Jul 22 11:34:10 2015 UTC,"I would totally disagree with this.   The battery life sucks.   The phone should also be your ace-in-the-hole as far as emergency help goes, so if you kill the battery for GPS and then end up in trouble, you are fucked.   Dedicated GPS units have way better battery life, usually are a lot more rugged and quicker to get a lock on."
Ultralight,3e6qy4,biotech9,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:21:16 2015 UTC,"Your point is valid, but I've found a strong preference for my phone over the dedicated Garmin for a couple of main reasons:   Maps are trivial to get. Even if I've forgotten to deal with it, I can usually grab them over my phone network on the way to the trailhead. They're up to date, and with Backcountry Navigator, I can select quite a variety of sources (not all the trails I take show up in all map sources.) Using the data after the trip, or keeping a database of my data is far simplified on my phone.  It automatically backs up the GPX tracks and I don't have to really think about getting data out.   Additionally, my phone has a halfway decent camera on it, and as much as I hate to admit it, on one trip it was the sort of don't-want-to-leave-your-sleeping-bag cold, so I hid and watched Netflix on my phone before bed (and was fortunate enough to have service, which I usually despise having.)  Leaving your phone on Airplane mode and then switching on the GPS only works to extend my phone to ~1.5 days of life.  I usually record tracks of my entire trek in.  Replacing a dedicated camera and GPS unit with a backup battery (what I have isn't made anymore, but sort of similar: http://www.ianker.com/product/A1209011 ) means I can recharge it nightly.  Usually I turn my phone off over night so it's not unnecessarily drawing energy, but it also means I have my emergency communications anyway.  I've had this setup last me on a 5 day trip, and still had juice remaining in the backup battery - and the battery I linked is 25% larger than what I currently own."

Ultralight,3e6qy4,mntlover,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:40:53 2015 UTC,"I think you really point out a key issue - from what I've seen, your experience with using your device this way can vary WILDLY based on several factors - your device, your carrier, your specific location, weather/surroundings..  Just have 2 people with 2 different devices walk side-by-side and compare.  Any time I've done this I've seen oddities.  Run Google ""My Tracks"" and see how your stats compare to someone who was right along side you.  Now, compare that to someone with a different carrier too.  I'm not saying the difference will always be substantial, but if I was relying on it for my life/safety, I'd be VERY concerned.   It's my understanding that a solid, stand-alone GPS is MUCH less likely to have such variance in experience.  But..having a budget and not wanting to carry an additional device (plus loving the other features of my smartphone) I can certainly understand why most people opt out of a dedicated GPS."

The only use Ray Jardine had for the light hiking boots he sometimes wore was in the Sierra in early season to facilitate kicking steps into snow. Apparently they did this better than the NB running shoes he typically wore, but when the lingering snow was gone he'd switch back and send the hiking boots home.  The basic ultralight principle is that you only need boots for ankle support if you're carrying heavy loads (over 30 pounds/ 14 kg) over rough terrain. When this fellow told you about wearing boots he probably had no conception of your tiny lightweight pack."

Personally, I believe that one should condition their joints to a point where they don't need to rely on boots to prevent injury.  Sharp rocks etc can bruise the soles of your feet also, perhaps consider a hiking shoe instead of a hiking boot. They are sort of in between boots and trail runners and are a good compromise of durability, weight and protection.

Ultralight,3e2gwd,bentmccorndick,2,Tue Jul 21 23:31:16 2015 UTC,"I really think the best compromise for you might be the HMG echo 2. It's basically a tent built around a tarp, with the closed foot end and especially with the beak. Together the setup is light (with lots of ability to go lighter), well-protected, and kinda fits right in with your 2 person bivy-that's-not-really kind of mindset, especially when you stake out the inner tent and get that sense of floor and wall shelter that's comforting about a tent. There's definitely plenty of room for the both of you since I'm 5'9 and have shared it with people from 5'6 to 6'1 and have honestly been swimming/sliding around in it with so much space. With the whole shebang you're looking at one person carrying tarp/beak/stakes for about 15oz-1lb and the other carrying the inner for about the same, and it is a little pricier than the alternatives you've listed, but it's for sure worth considering. Note though, I'm a lanky 5'9 and the ""mid"" part of the beak/tarp is not roomy enough for me to stretch out in this shelter. I can dress, cook, read, stretch, and even break shelter- all with a partner as well- but it is not spacious or remarkably comfortable until you're laying down.   If you were asking about the pct/cdt, where a considerable amount of trail is above treeline or kinda alpineish, I'd say a trailstar would be totally perfect for you, but I think it's kinda specialized for weather you wont really have to fight that much on the AT.  Another option I could throw you might be an UL big agnes style tent in fast fly mode, but I've honestly never used a tent in that style.   Lately I've been playing with a poncho/tarp, but it seems the right tarp size:body size ratio makes too small a shelter and too long a poncho, but I kinda want to think using the buddy system with a dual-half-pyramid setup is promising, but one half-pyramid is not enough in a hard rain on its own.  Edit: Don't forget to relish the fact that you have a girlfriend willing to do the AT with you, tarp or no. That's a special girl you have, and an even better bond, and that alone will take enough off your shoulders to not worry about what you pitch for a shelter. Happy trails amigo"

Ultralight,3e0f1p,VicetheWarrior,5,Tue Jul 21 00:15:10 2015 UTC,"I thru hiked the Long Trail with the Osprey Exos 48 and it held up fantastically, I have been using it for about three years since as my overnighter bag. I have no complaints. I feel it is the perfect balance of comfort / weight. The mesh in the back is the selling point, very comfortable on the back and the webbing makes it such that you have great airflow on your back, which is very nice. I would buy it again. I havent used any of the other bags on your list mind you. Good luck."
Ultralight,3e0f1p,wwdillingham,3,Tue Jul 21 00:48:59 2015 UTC,"I have the Exos 58 and have used it on many 3-5 day hikes. It has served me very well, although as I begin to cut down on gear, weight and bulk I suspect it will be too big. I love the mesh backing - it keeps me nice and cool. My only complaint is that because it uses a thinner fabric to cut weight, it may not be very durable in the long run. I don't throw it around on rocks and such, but when putting it down I am very conscious of how and where I place it.  I love the pockets on the side of the pack. I can put stuff like bear spray or water bottles in there and reach them while I'm hiking. I also like the hip belt pockets which are probably becoming standard on packs nowadays, but this is the first pack I've had with them and I'll never go back. I haven't used the trekking pole loops yet since I don't have any, but if and when I do get them, the quick on-the-go storage option will be neat.  Overall, I'm very happy with it and I would recommend it. Make sure you try them on with weight because I've heard from others that sometimes it doesn't fit well which would force you to look at other options."

Ultralight,3e0f1p,laughter95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:38:05 2015 UTC,"So you have used the arc haul, then, and found it to be more comfortable  than the circuit? At what base weight?"

Ultralight,3e0f1p,generationfourth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:58:57 2015 UTC,I'd take a look at the Granite Gear Crown VC 60. That's what I settled with. Although it might be on the bigger side for your base weight. I wouldn't use anything over 2.5 pounds especially in your case. For me it came down to the Circuit vs. the Crown 60. I went with the 60 because it fit well and had a couple of design features I liked over the circuit.   I used to be a sucker for the mesh back design but I found that your back sweats anyway and it ruins your center of gravity. I find that loosening the load lifter straps on easier terrain helps vent.
Ultralight,3e0f1p,generationfourth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:00:09 2015 UTC,That last bit about the mesh is really interesting.
Ultralight,3e0f1p,mrcrontab,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:23:09 2015 UTC,"To clear things up I think it really depends on where you plan on hiking. In the Sierra where the temps are consistently 60-70 degrees I find the mesh back to be overkill. Could be more useful in warmer climates.  I used to really like deuter packs which have really good vent systems. My trusty old ACT lite 65+10 has an air channel system. It was good for venting but I found that I was always tightening the straps and trying to get the weight as close to my body as possible. If I didn't it would start to hurt my back.   I've noticed that all packs will make contact with your upper back, and lower back (where the shoulder straps and hip belt meet your body). With a mesh design you're only really venting a small portion (center) of your back. Most frameless/regular packs have a little bit of space for air to flow naturally."

Ultralight,3e0f1p,fieldsofkale69,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:28:29 2015 UTC,"I was looking at the Granite Gear Crown VC 60 vs ULA Circuit for the PCT.   Went with the Crown VC because of the perfect fit to my stocky frame (5'9"" 170 lbs), fell in love with it's low weight and removeable frame (35 oz w/frame vs 29 oz w/o). Expands quite large which was useful for times when went 7-10 days between resupply, and easily fit my BearVault 450 canister. Love the straps on top for bulky items, mesh pockets worked well, shoulder strap mesh pockets held smartphone and sunscreen for quick access while hiking. Had plenty of backsweat, but cannot imagine any pack would have been different. I used it for mountaineering all winter (carrying heavy loads with helmet, ice axe, snowshoes, crampons, trekking poles, etc) and it is amazingly durable, but it definitely wasn't designed for carrying much weight -- over 25 lbs, need the use the frame; over 35 lbs digs into shoulders. Got new mountaineering pack this spring, will keep GG Crown for UL hiking only.  That said, I saw more ULA Circuits than any other pack on the PCT, by a long shot. Never owned one, but every thru hiker I talked to loved theirs, so I cannot imagine you would not also love it.  With such a low base weight no need for framed pack, imo. Only section hiked parts of the AT, but can't imagine you won't be drenched in sweat regardless of your pack..."

Ultralight,3dyl4y,ianmeister,2,Mon Jul 20 18:35:34 2015 UTC,"That's my problem...I think that Kelty really overestimates the size the tent packs down to.  The bag in comes in is 12x15, and if I can squeeze the tent and fly to about half that size...so separating the fly and tent into two bags I'm thinking roughly a quarter each...and I'm having a hard time finding sacks that small that still compress."
Ultralight,3dyl4y,realslacker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure why you would want compression sacks for both components after you've already split them.  Why not just get two lightweight stuff sacks that are the size you need?  I'm pretty sure you don't see Compression sacks that small for a reason- the difference a compression sack will make on a small sack is minimal, compared to a large- there isn't very much compressible space (typical construction also presents some size limitations.)  There are diminishing returns regarding compression vs weight.    What about small vacuum pouches, like these? http://www.zappos.com/eagle-creek-pack-it-compression-sac-set-m-l-clear?ef_id=VSNwvQAABI5NUniN:20150720190250:s"

It'll be easier to find a dry sack that is smaller than a compression sack."
Ultralight,3dyl4y,realslacker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:37 2015 UTC,"Is compressing these really the solution?  Why compress them before they go into your pack, when you can just put them in an appropriately sized sack, then compress them by putting other things on top of them?  You'll save weight this way, and you won't be losing the space in the end.    Or- make your own compression sacks? get a cam strap or two around the stuff sack then really wrench that sucker down."
Ultralight,3dyl4y,b_rad_ical,3,Mon Jul 20 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"Forget the sacks. Put a trash compactor bag (thicker than other trash bags) in your backpacks.

Also, helps to fill all the nooks and crannies."

Then again, I haven't done this regularly in about ten years (and a few weekends ago was the first trip I've done since around 2005) so I'm not completely closed off to trying a different method.  I'll look into this, if anything for water protection.  I've only heard of ""compactor bags"" since I started reading a few (modern) books on backpacking...never encountered one.  Where do you find them?  I backpacked pretty regularly (at least once per month) all through high school, but not only has it been around ten years, I also didn't have a real focus on shooting for ultralight when I did it.  I'm trying to strike a happy medium and slowly replace my older gear...so please pardon my relative ignorance."

They are a hold over from the 80s and early 90s when people thought it better to smash their garbage than to take it out... Pretty rare these days to see an operating trash compactor.  Anyway, I like them because they are thicker and don't get holes easily. I've been using the same one for two, almost  three seasons now.  I don't put EVERYTHING in the bag though. I hammock so I usually do something like quilts in the bottom, then Hammock, then clothes in a loose stuff sack, then Tarp on the top or outside.  I don't like small stuff floating around so I usually opt for an oversized stuff sack so I can still cram it down well.  Hope that helps!"

Instead of turning on the car and plugging in I decided to break out my hand-crank.  It took 15-20 minutes to even get my smart phone to turn on.  Then, I couldn't really make a call because the phone kept dying unless I constantly cranked the generator.  You would not be able to take pictures this way.  (I used a charger that looks exactly like the first link in your OP.)  Caveats: older cell phone with typically terrible battery life.  If I had nothing better to do (which I didn't but I guess I get lazy in civilization), I could have sat there for an hour or more and just charged, THEN turned on the phone--perhaps that would have worked.

Ultralight,3dxd6i,CesarV,5,Mon Jul 20 09:04:18 2015 UTC,As someone looking into perhaps replacing a synthetic heavier bag with a lighter down bag. This post hasn't really helped sway me one way or the other.
Ultralight,3dxd6i,oxhands,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:03:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry.  Thought it was worth fleshing out what I see as a central issue when it comes to choosing one insulation over the other.  Clearly I've not communicated it very effectively based on the harsh downvoting this thread has gotten, and as you've pointed out it's not helped you at all.  But what I would ask you is what kind of backpacking you are going to be doing in general?  If it's going to be more hardcore trips in wet conditions, then go with synthetic.  If it's hiking on marked trails in more or less ""normal"" conditions, ask yourself if you are willing to do a bit of upkeep on your bag from time to time on the trail.  This means airing/sunning it when it gets a bit damp as needed.  Is this more helpful?"
Ultralight,3dxd6i,oxhands,2,Mon Jul 20 11:16:32 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, your post was definitely helpful as you've given your opinion with hindsight on the advantages of both. I just haven't made up my mind whether to stick with the synth bag I have, which has served me well in previous trips. Or too spend a bit of money on a new Down bag, lighter, smaller but ultimately useless if it gets wet. I've never had a problem with keeping my pack dry, it more just comes down to money.   The point I was making is that you've given advantages to both, and not said why one is far superior. As a sidenote I actually upvoted the post."
Ultralight,3dxd6i,oxhands,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:38:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback and kind words!  I intentionally left out the whole ""far superior"" thing because I don't think either is--I think that there is a superior choice based on the given trip.  Going to do a thru-hike of say an isolated trail in wet and cold conditions?  I'd say synth might be best, and even then I'd still want to know more information and context before making up my mind.  What I would say, however, is that from what I am able to gather about the majority of backpacking trips that most people go on and/or discuss, is that down is usually the best choice so long as the backpacker is cool with a bit of maintenance.  Mos def for section hikes and weekend trips on marked trails (which is what I do most of the time), a good down bag I think is the better choice.  Just make sure to keep it protected with at least two layers of water cover, like a silnylon/Cuben stuff sack plus rain poncho or pack cover for instance."
Ultralight,3dxd6i,coolhandluke45,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:29:51 2015 UTC,"Much appreciated. Yeah I mostly do section hikes, weekend trips too, but being based in the UK I'm very aware that it may well rain for the entire weekend without relenting. Saying that I've never had a problem with any of my gear getting wet, I have a poncho with a bag extension bit and a liner for my pack, that combo has always done well. Only reason I'd be upgrading is to save space in my pack and lose a bit of weight. I've considered investing in a Cumulus lite line sleeping bag in the near future. Any experience with them?"
Ultralight,3dxd6i,haroprease,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:44:19 2015 UTC,"Glad to help :)  No experience with Cumulus.  I have two Zpacks down bags and love love love them both.  But I also have a MYOG summer bag that is silk/Argon 67 with Apex 2.5 synth insulation that I also love, and that has gotten good use this summer.  If you go the MYOG route and want a great, fairly light and not very bulky, an Apex bag is a great option.  Plus mine only cost about 40 bucks total, including shipping costs to Sweden.  I have found it works great for low temps down to around 12-11C."

If they invent a new type of synthetic insulation that is lighter than down, this might be the nail in the coffin for this debate.  Obviously such a material would have to be tested in the field before the nail gets hammed all the way down, but yeah weight is the elephant in the room here.  Though synth is generally a bit bulkier too, but I would imagine that a new synth that is less in weight may also be less in bulk."

The fall works best and you are able to get a full bag to filter. In a stream I can usually get 2/3 full bag. Don't waste your time with the 16oz bag, it's a headache."

Ultralight,3dv823,Afin12,3,Sun Jul 19 22:14:27 2015 UTC,"Like others here, I own both and prefer the regular; mini's flow is a bit too slow, especially if filtering into a clean bottle for gatorade or electrolyte tabs.   I don't like the bags, I just find them hard to fill up without a good little waterfall, whereas bottles are easy to fill even in stagnant water. Any water bottle will do, I like the SmartWater 1L bottles because of their shape, fit well in my pack's side pouch. I like having 1 for dirty water, 1 for gatorade/electrolyte/instant coffee.  Just don't let the Sawyer filter freeze, or it can ruin the filter. In cold areas, I put it in my sleeping bag at night.  Also, I often screw the bottles on too tight, and end up crushing the white rubber washer causing leaking (which can cause dirty water to drip into clean water bottle if you hold upright while filtering). This guy has a brilliant idea, which I haven't tried yet, but basically take a $0.25 hose prefilter and put on top of the white washer: http://iris.backcountry.com/image/view/c89502/900/900    Prefilters really rough water and protects the white washer from damage. Definitely going to try this trick."

If you e-mail Sawyer and ask for another O-ring, they'll send you one for free. I just keep having issues with the O-ring getting wrecked in only a few trips. I may be the only person having this problem though...  EDIT I think in the future I may carry both. I do carry a 3 liter collapsable bladder that I fill up when I get to camp and add drops to purify.

Backpacks might be problematic if your parents have health issues that make it difficult to wear a loaded backpack. UL backpacks tend to not have frames which makes them ultralight (obv) but carrying loads in a frameless backpack can be more uncomfortable than a heavier backpack with a frame. Non wheeled suitcases share the same issue as dufflebags and are heavier. Wheeled suitcases are the heaviest option but most comfortable for most people to tote around a big airport.   What are the weight restrictions? Are they going to check baggage or go carry on only? And if they're doing carry on only and flying the most budget of budget airlines, might as well spend a little extra to check the bags or fly a proper airline. Most of the time, the savings you get for flying an ultrabudget airline isn't worth it after all of the add ons & pain. And what would their budget be for getting the ultralight gear?

Ultralight,3ds7xb,b_rad_ical,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:33:29 2015 UTC,"I was torn between the  Crown and Blaze.   Blaze is heavier and more rigid, so higher weight load capacity which is really nice for mountaineering and climbing, with the weights of rope, harness, quick draws, helmet, ice axe, crampons, snowshoes, etc, on top of base weight and food.   For the PCT, I went with the Crown, which has the removeable frame bringing weight down to a pound, and love it. That said, over 25 lbs and I prefer to use the frame, and even then over 35 lbs and it cuts into shoulders and hip. Friend uses the Blaze, says it works well up to 40 lbs, and he has gotten away with 50 lbs.   I don't use the Crown much for mountaineering, but I don't mind having specialized gear for different activities, as opposed to one-size-fits-all multi-use gear."

Ultralight,3dqpky,dandydandy,6,Sat Jul 18 16:38:47 2015 UTC,"Glad to see REI offering quality at a good price, definitely a step in the right direction for a box store. Will help a lot of my friends lighten their load, and maybe extend their seasons and comfort a bit, which helps me get them out more often when it's less crowded.   Being a hammock camper, I can't find many things that are light and/or inexpensive in stores, or even on Amazon these days. The only things that I can pick up in these places are cookware (and i'm beginning to start experimenting with stoveless trips due to fire restrictions in California) and clothing. Everything else in my gear list is pretty much cottage industry by now."
Ultralight,3dqpky,dandydandy,2,Sat Jul 18 16:57:26 2015 UTC,"I think we'll have to see how the quality is on this new line of products. I generally trust that the products REI sells are pretty good.

Ultralight,3dq77j,JohnReggae,3,Sat Jul 18 11:14:19 2015 UTC,"I have done parts of it, specifically from the New York border south through PA via the Allegheny National Forest what questions do you have?  EDIT: Here are some pictures of the trail section in question: Camp on an offshoot of the Allegheny Reservoir Camp on the reservoir #2 Campfire at Handsome Lake Osprey resting on a boulder Blue Blazes mark the NCT The trail"
Ultralight,3dq77j,snail-eyestalks,2,Sat Jul 18 11:23:24 2015 UTC,"Awesome; thanks for the reply. The route you suggested is the route that I am looking to head out on. Just a few questions, if you don't mind: 1. How was trailhead parking--safe? 2. Did you start the trail in Allegheny SP on the New York side and then walk through to Pennsylvania, or did you start at the trailhead on 346 (?) and then hike solely in PA? 3. Water sources--I have read scattered reports of fracking having fucked the water in Allegheny. Is water frequent along the trail, and/or drinkable? 4. Bugs this time of year? 5. Overall safeness of the trail. I am from the PNW, where national forests = Robin Hood-type, confederate hold-outs. Not that I mind terribly, but is Allegheny (the NCT anyways) a safe place to pitch my tarp?  Thanks!"
Ultralight,3dq77j,snail-eyestalks,4,Sat Jul 18 12:10:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah no problem, I actually do that part of the trail a couple times of year, it's pretty close to where I live.    I park right off the road on a little parking lot, it is right across the street from the PA trailhead. I have the GPS coordinates in my Garmin, I can send them to you if you like. I've left my car there for days on end and never had any issues.  I always start at the trailhead on 346 and hike south into PA, only because the NY section is so short and there isn't much to see.  There are plenty of little streams and rivulets coming down the mountain so you will never be far from a water source. The first campsite you come across is right on the little offshoot of the Allegheny Reservoir, so plenty of water there too. There is a stream that comes down from the mountain and dumps into the reservoir there, that's where I always fill up. No chance that fracking has effected the mountain runoff. I have a MSR water filter.  Count on black flies in the day and mosquitoes at night.  Perfectly safe. The only other people you might run into are fellow backpackers and day hikers. I have never had an issue.    Other tips: It's a hilly hike. Lots of up and down low mountains so it can get tiring, especially on hot days.  The trail is well blazed and easy to follow so you shouldn't have any issues. Definitely have to hang your food at night, there are a lot of black bears. When you're near the reservoir keep an eye out for bald eagles, there are tons of them!"
Ultralight,3dq77j,snail-eyestalks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:21:45 2015 UTC,Thank you kindly. This was a nice twist of fate to have you respond.  It looks like the NCT runs for about 93 miles south into Allegheny: how far have you gone on the trail? And how many miles per day do you comfortably cover?   Thanks again for the info!
Ultralight,3dq77j,snail-eyestalks,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:09:56 2015 UTC,"Sure, no problem. It's pretty hilly terrain, the first ten miles or so especially. I would say you could do 10-15 miles a day without killing yourself. I think the furthest I've gone is about 30 miles south."

How are the camp opportunities? Because it is national forest, is it just the standard ""camp wherever,"" or are there heavily regulated, designated spots?"
Ultralight,3dpd5d,snoop37,2,Sat Jul 18 04:05:10 2015 UTC,"I slept in it the other night. Apparently you just need to do the footprint into the poles first and then the tent. Also, never knew people didn't know this until this past trip but don't just stick your stakes into the tent loops. Use cord and do a tautline hitch or truckers hitch to secure the tent. You get a much sturdier tent this way."
Ultralight,3dpd5d,flouride,2,Sat Jul 18 06:56:17 2015 UTC,"I have this tent and footprint, and have never had issues with the footprint. Fits the way it's supposed to: slightly smaller than the tent floor, to stop water pooling. I just had to make some small adjustments to the length of the straps, lines, etc. the first time I set it up, to get a nice taught pitch. I really like the convenience of those plastic clips at the corners."
Ultralight,3dpd5d,_spreadsheets_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:58:11 2015 UTC,"If you want to set it up in fly-only mode, you need the BA footprint due to the design. So if that's a big deal, you don't have any other options regarding the footprint :("
Ultralight,3dpd5d,chacochaco,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:52:46 2015 UTC,"I have both a UL2 and UL1 with footprints. The footprints themselves are smaller in surface area than the tents (so rain runoff hits the ground instead), but with where the grommets are placed on the longish straps they still tend to come loose unless you clip the rain fly to them and then cinch the straps. For me this works fine except when I'd rather not use the rain fly - then I am forced to pull the corners taut, which isn't always easy to do in hard/rocky ground.  All in all I think they're fine and having the rain fly clips makes them better than using tyvek or window film."

Ultralight,3dqrcs,abagofit,4,Sat Jul 18 15:28:27 2015 UTC,"One can actually do some pretty good stuff with recipes that merely call for boiling water.  A base such as instant couscous or minute rice, some sort of dried sauce, a little olive oil or butter, and some sort of vegetables or meat or beans -- which for you can buy on the road so they don't even have to be dried or preserved.  My favorite meal which I recently made while backpacking:  Knorr instant pesto mix (comes in a small envelope, add water and olive oil and boil for a minute or so), minute rice, and smoked salmon from one of those foil packages (so the salmon wasn't dried, but didn't require refrigeration).  Took only minutes to make, all in a single pot, and highly delicious."
Ultralight,3dqrcs,mkt42,2,Sun Jul 19 09:20:02 2015 UTC,"A stove like a windboiler/jetboil is really just for boiling water and making rehydrated meals, which tend to be expensive. For a solution that would let you do more cooking and keep you out of restaurants, I would steer you towards a remote canister stove like a whisperlite that will let you use real cookware and have some temperature control and let you cook more traditional meals."
Ultralight,3dqrcs,DontWorry-AboutIt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:26:37 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I was wondering about. Dehydrated meals don't sound appealing. If I can't cook properly I might as well just go without all together.
Ultralight,3dqrcs,DontWorry-AboutIt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:24:49 2015 UTC,"Your other option is to have a lot of foods that don't need to be cooked like nuts, cheeses, and salami, maybe supplemented with an alcohol stove for hot drinks and just-add-water stuff.  Actually, come to think about it, one of those grills that attaches to the exhaust and cooks wienies and burgers while you ride could be fun."
Ultralight,3dqrcs,hispeedzintarwebz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"Just a note about the whisperlite - I love that stove, but it only has two settings - hot, and fucking afterburner.  You can definitely do more than you can with a jetboil, but if you want to do anything using the word ""simmer"" you'll have to get creative as to how you suspend a pot/pan over it.  I'm not knocking it - that's why I will always carry it over something like a jetboil...I value the flexibility in both what I can cook and what fuels I use...but that thing cranks out heat.  Cooking eggs, for instance, is a nerve-wracking 20 seconds or so on mine.  Not unusable by any stretch of the imagination...just might take some tinkering.  I would make a few meals in the backyard to get a good handle on it.  Anything water based (pasta, couscous, rice, etc.) will be much easier than something like eggs or sauces.  Then you can make a pot stand out of something like coat hangers or metal pieces that elevates the pot a few inches, or rig up some kind of tripod that hangs a pot from a bale...but that's just my experience.  The pot being about 3 inches from where it rests normally really changes the dynamic of using that stove...so don't get the impression that you have to hang a pot a foot above the burner like it's a campfire or something.  One time on a car camping trip I used one of those things that pizza places have that hold the pizza above the table...probably less applicable for something like backpacking or motorcycle trips, but that might give you an idea.  That's why I usually end up just using it to boil water...but again I like the flexibility, I'm stubborn, and it's familiar to me.  It is a great deal heavier than something like a jetboil...but compared to the Coleman Peak 1 stove I carried for a long time it's a good step in the right direction.  But that's just based on my experiences...someone else might have more/better/different things to say.  Also, FWIW, I was really skeptical about meals like Mountain House, but they're delicious and some you can add water, stir and eat out of the bag, which means that you don't have to wash out the pot and you also don't have to worry about a bowl/plate to eat out of.  I know that's less applicable to your situation, but if a portion of your trip is a little more remote and you can buy these somewhere, I think they're worth a try."

The west is an entirely different matter. Alpine areas can turn bitterly cold in a flash and snow is possible during any month.  I suppose for a weekend trip it would work, but not for thru-hiking because you don't have a forecast."
Ultralight,3dp09h,Thexorretor,2,Sat Jul 18 04:58:27 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the weather. Most cases of hypothermia occur a bit colder than that, but not at extreme temps; 30-50 degrees.  Like u/gtbuzzed said, 60 degrees and raining can feel like 40. Then the sun sets and it gets really cold.   On the other hand, if it's 85 the rain might just make it a little more comfortable, while rain gear will just make you hot and sweaty, so you're getting wet either way. And if you're in Florida it's just going to be hot and rainy."
Ultralight,3dp09h,mrjowee,2,Sat Jul 18 11:37:52 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, really depends on which trail/region you are hiking. Have only done stretches of the AT, but on the PCT and CDT I brought rain gear and am very glad I did. That said, I passed plenty of hikers with no rain gear, and a few that didn't even have tarps (just foam pad and sleeping bag).  On CDT I got rained on sporadically, but very heavy storms, sometimes with major temp drops and hail. Most times it would dump rain, then clear up and I could dry out fairly quickly. But often the storms had lightning, so I would avoid trees and look for open fields, getting fully drenched.  On the PCT I had good weather overall; roughly 4 days of rain in North Cascades, 3 days of rain in central OR, and 2 days of rain in CA High Sierras (both good storms with hail and temp drop), 1 day of good snow in Sierras.   So out of ~100 days of hiking PCT, I only had 10 days of rain, so I could see arguments on both sides. I appreciated being dry in the rain, especially around the South Sister and High Sierras where it was quite cold. I had a long sleeve cotton shirt on top of my base layer, and found it does a good job of sucking the moisture out of the base layer keeping my skin generally dry despite sweating.  If you didn't bring a rain jacket, I would at least make sure your sleeping bag is in a dry sack, worse case you hunker down under tarp in dry warm bag and wait out the storm."
Ultralight,3dp09h,b_rad_ical,2,Sat Jul 18 17:47:18 2015 UTC,"I've seen winds well over 60 knots on Mt Washington, NH.    Rain hail and freezing rain, round rocks coated with 3/8ths of an inch of ice. That was later in the year than most thru-hikers, but the AT rolls high in that area.    Walking on all fours to get off the higher elevations is funny, fun, people falling left right and center is hilarious when they try standing in the wind.   (No one hurt themselves much!)   So yes to rainwear of some kind."
Ultralight,3dp09h,Marc-le-Half-Fool,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:42:25 2015 UTC,"The very short answer: rain gear is not necessary except in certain extreme situations (cold and wet, long periods of inactivity, extreme wetness such as wave action on fishing vessels)  WPBs, although toted as breathable are entirely dependant on the DWP and won't last the length of many thruhikes.  More, DWP degrades from abrasion, sweat, chemicals, and just regular wear.  PU-lined or fully waterproof raingear is great when the price of being wetted by external water is much worse than sweating it out from within.  Boating, fishing, winter climbing, etc.  Or for periods of rest or in areas of constant moisture... Better to be protected.  I can go into more detail on thermal gradients, dew points, moisture transfer, wetting out, nano technology, etc. but you get my point.  TL;DR: yes, I use a SUL windbreaker doubling as my raingear.  I wear moisture-wicking clothing under it and maintain elevated body heat through activity to maintain warmth.  The windbreaker blocks heat-stealing wind and sheds the majority of the rain.  In heavy storms I seek shelter or bring more appropriate gear."
Ultralight,3dp09h,summiter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:26:16 2015 UTC,"As others have said, rain drags your core temperature down like nothing else, leading to possible hypothermia and definite misery. Even if your legs are damp from sweat in your rain trousers, it'll be a warm dampness, which is far better than being cold. The weight of a few hundred grams is not worth the danger of being soaked to the skin in the cold with night coming and no way to light a fire.  Obviously though, it depends on where you are and what time of year it is. The southern US in the summer? You can probably get away with it. The same place in the winter or mountainous areas in the summer? Always bring rain gear."

Ultralight,3dp09h,generationfourth,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:42:47 2015 UTC,"I think it's a horrible idea. Yeah you may only need it a few times through out your trip but all it takes is a quick soaking and the temperature to drop to put you in a deadly situation.   On my last Sierra outing a Helium II rain shell (borrowed from a friend), and REI e-vent pants (bought last minute) saved my ass. Coming down from a pass in a rain/lightning storm I needed to book it 4 miles down to a safer spot. I couldn't put my shelter down, and without changing into the rain gear I would've been in deep shit as the temperature dropped drastically. Had I kept the rain soaked pants on I could barely move. The thought of being shirtless in this situation makes me laugh.  I wore a light base layer underneath the shell and was basically running. Surprisingly the layers breathed very well. Even if you get stuffy it sure beats being soaked. To offset the weight of the pants (11 oz.) I didn't bring my base layer bottoms and just wore the rain pants almost as a second pair of pants. The rain technology has come a long way, trust it! My base weight is still 16 lbs with a bear can and 1 lb. camera."
Ultralight,3dnbt0,not_a_relevant_name,3,Fri Jul 17 17:46:34 2015 UTC,"this should be easy. pull tight on the sides and tight at the apex of the mini a-frame and it will spread. the tension pulls the carbon fiber poles down, which spreads them. if you pull at the apex where the trekking pole is toward the side stakes while pulling on the side guy line, that will promote tautness across the top ridge line and give you a little more length to pull on the side guy line.   one thing i consistently have trouble with is when i'm done putting all four stakes down, i always have to restake one or two because it's not aligned perfectly across the other end."

Ultralight,3dn89a,Ilium_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:21:12 2015 UTC,"Have you looked at Cumulus? Some bags like the Panyam 450 are for people up to 190cm. They are really cheap compared to most other options available in Europe. A lot of their stuff is only up to 185cm though, but maybe they can hook you up with a custom one, since you still have some time before your hikes. If you're willing to pay more, there's PHDesigns. There's other, bigger manufacturers out there, that you'll find in more mainstream stores, but their stuff is not as nice as PHD and will cost you the same. Can't help you with the rating unfortunately. Well, I can tell you that August in Japan is indeed very warm and humid, so I'd prefer a quilt over a sleeping bag for easier venting. Personally I'd get a 20° quilt and then adjust clothing as required. That's just a general approach though, since I've not been either of those trails."

Which, if you're taking a set of warm clothes anyway and aren't camping up at high elevations, i'd recommend with a liner instead.    But especially for august, that 30 degree bag would be a killer in the heat, and i'd imagine still to hot for September/October too."

I guess I will try and find a 20 degree sleeping bag or quilt for the PCT and I might not even take that to Japan, but just use a liner there and bring some of my warmer gear from the PCT to sleep in.  How does that sound?"
Ultralight,3dn89a,bobbyfiend,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:49:49 2015 UTC,"I'm 6'4"" and I've found that quilts are much better than bags.  Quilts are both more comfortable and warm (for the dollar...or euro...).  But more importantly, to me, they provide a way to regulate the ""heat.""  I have a 0 degree quilt that I've used in Southern California without being too warm.  I also have a 35 degree Western Mountaineering bag (not a quilt)...in my opinion the rating is a bit generous, it's more like a 45 degree bag.  So if that's what you want, then (if you're like me) you won't be too hot in Japan.    Many of us here on r/ultralight love Enlightened Equipment quilts...you may want to check them out."

Importing will add close to another $100 so I am looking for ""local"" products.  I came across this quilt from Cumulus (as mentioned by /u/NumberslnSnow) who also take custom orders to extend the length). Do you reckon I will be okay with this in the Sierras? http://sleepingbags-cumulus.eu/uk/categories/sleeping-systems/quilt-450?gid=53&vid=7  The website rates the comfort level for this quilt at -1 celcius and the limit at -7.  Another option would be an extended version of the http://sleepingbags-cumulus.eu/uk/categories/sleeping-bags/panyam-450?gid=59&vid=6  The sleeping back comes in at about 200 grams extra.  I'd love to hear your opinion on this. I am quite skinny but usually do pretty well in cold, but I don't want to freeze my ass of in the Sierras.  I figured that if I decide to go for the sleeping bag I could always unzip it and use it as a blanket in Japan, but the quilt definitely looks appealing."

Ultralight,3dmf0n,xxse7en,3,Fri Jul 17 15:35:21 2015 UTC,Me too. It has replaced my R1 and is incredibly versatile. At full retail price I said no way. But it soon went on a very steep discount that made it very accessible.
Ultralight,3dmf0n,life-goes-on,2,Fri Jul 17 16:14:53 2015 UTC,"I've never had an R1, but it was on the table when I was trying to replace my mid this year. How does the deviator compare to the R1 in terms of packed bulk?"
Ultralight,3dmf0n,xxse7en,2,Fri Jul 17 16:17:10 2015 UTC,"I think it's a wash. The fleece portions of the deviator are thinner than the R1 (hood, sleeves, and back) but the chest and shoulder insulation adds back some bulk. Also, the large deviator is slimmer than the large R1 which may reduce the bulk of the deviator in comparison."
Ultralight,3dmf0n,life-goes-on,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:21:04 2015 UTC,How's the warmth compare to the R1 I'm guessing more in the core but less in the arms ect?
Ultralight,3dmf0n,makinbacon42,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:14:49 2015 UTC,"You're right on. The hood and sleeves are not as warm on the deviator. For me this is an improvement as I find the R1 too warm for an active layer but not warm enough for the weight to be a resting layer. The chest and shoulder insulation on the deviator makes these areas about as warm as the R1 but I think they breathe better. Overall, the R1 is warmer, which may or may not be good for you."

For around town, traveling or when pack weight/bulk isn't as much of a concern, I'd say go with merino."
Ultralight,3dmf0n,cwcoleman,4,Sat Jul 18 16:02:07 2015 UTC,Icebreaker Quantum Long Sleeve Zip Hoodie is a killer mid-layer. The Ibex Shark is also popular (although I've never owned it).
Ultralight,3dmf0n,cwcoleman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"The quantum looks like the best option I've seen so far. If the warmth is decent and it packs down it could be the winner, particularly if it doesn't wear down and develop holes like really lightweight merino tends to do."
Ultralight,3dmf0n,brehew,2,Fri Jul 17 22:17:48 2015 UTC,"Both the GF and I have one. Worn it many seasons with great performance. Depending on how hard you are - holes are inevitable with wool. GF has a good size hole forming near the wrist, I don't have any.       The full-zip is key. Good to vent, then tighten up and get toasty. It's thin enough to hike in, but warm enough for layering in camp. An ideal mid-layer."

Ultralight,3dlf90,ranchomofo,2,Fri Jul 17 16:58:28 2015 UTC,"Backpacking is not primarily weight conscious.  UL and weight-consious purchasers are a small subset of a much larger 'I want something that will be comfortable, last a long time, and be functional' crowd. If enough items (as a percentage of total sales) are returned due to 'not as advertised: weight' you can bet the seller will be more conscientious to list the correct weights.  It is the free market and how buyers influence sellers. Of course if only a small number of total sales are returned the seller simply absorbs the loss as normal cost of during business. In the meantime, as traditional in unregulated markets, the consumer experiences temporary frustration."
Ultralight,3dlo3v,nordicul,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:30:44 2015 UTC,"I tried the Boreas Gear Topaz 18 at a local store when it was on discount. It's a very sturdy but light daypack. Salesperson claimed it was waterproof.   However, the reason why I didn't get the Topaz was because of the roll-top closure. I realised that unless you're carrying a full bag to the brim, the roll-top folds tend to come undone with a bit of movement. It causes the opening to 'flap' out a bit and it doesn't feel so secure with the clip. Since I come from the tropics, I didn't want to risk my stuff getting wet.  Other than that, for the price, it's decent."
Ultralight,3dlo3v,stray-stride,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:28:07 2015 UTC,"Odd that the salesperson said it was waterproof, the tag (and the eyes) make clear it isn't. Haven't yet encountered any trouble with the roll-top coming undone, but thanks for the heads up. With a good bit of weight in, it did well (i.e. I didn't feel the weight), so better than my Fjällraven rucksack on that front (though much less durable/waterproof).  Definitely one to avoid for wet weather though, as I can see water/humidity worming its way in. Also, there's obviously limited room for rain jacket/trousers (too cold/windy to use an umbrella unfortunately)."

Ultralight,3dixha,mrjowee,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:15:16 2015 UTC,"When people use single wall shelters, do they only pitch them when there's a definite chance of rain? Or do they provide warmth as well? Seems like if there's no rain and no bugnet you might as well cowboy camp (but still bring it, obviously)."
Ultralight,3dixha,mindftw,6,Thu Jul 16 18:28:53 2015 UTC,"If there is no rain and no bugs, you have no reason to pitch a double walled shelter either, right?"
Ultralight,3dixha,cwcoleman,2,Thu Jul 16 19:06:11 2015 UTC,no rain and no bugNET   NOT 'no bugs'. changes the question considerably.
Ultralight,3dixha,mrjowee,3,Fri Jul 17 02:41:56 2015 UTC,"Rain is definitely the primary purpose of a shelter like this. Although they also provide protection from wind and dew. Plus the whole 'privacy' thing (if you are in a popular area like the JMT). They still give some relief from flying bugs, especially if you pitch it low to the ground like in OP's picture.           It's really not that different than a double wall shelter. Just takes some getting used to. One of the things that 'once you go' you'll never look back.      There are always nights when you skip the shelter all together - going cowboy style. The encouragement to sleep under the stars more often is another bonus in my eyes."
Ultralight,3dixha,mrjowee,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:15:29 2015 UTC,"I didn't even consider privacy. Good call on that. But it most certainly is something people will try once and not like; I'm one of them. Single wall shelters are just too stuffy and collect too much condensation in a hot, humid environment."
Ultralight,3dixha,cwcoleman,2,Fri Jul 17 11:22:30 2015 UTC,My tarp is so much better for hot/humid nights then my tent ever was. Having the ability to pitch it higher and get more airflow is amazing.  You can also get a system where the tarp and bug-net/bathtub floor are totallly separate and can be pitched independently - then you get the ultimate flexibility based on your trip and trail conditions.
Ultralight,3dixha,irish_shindig,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:10:46 2015 UTC,"Why use a tarp when you can use a hammock? Or are there hot, humid mountain tops I don't know about?"
Ultralight,3dixha,cwcoleman,2,Fri Jul 17 13:23:11 2015 UTC,"General consensus I've seen is hammocks end up being heavier.  Personally though? I had never considered sleeping out in a hammock while I was buying my UL kit. Also it's a polarizing way to sleep. I went out with two friends and did a trip where we slept in hammocks (Eno's, nothing super fancy) where I slept great and they didn't sleep for shit. So some folks just don't like it. I also take a dog or two with me, and they need shelter at night during buggy/rainy times just like I do. And one of them won't cuddle up and is too big to get into a hammock with me (the other one weighs ~15 lbs and would love it though).  But yeah, fair point. Something folks should consider when building their kits."
Ultralight,3dixha,hupo224,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:31:36 2015 UTC,"Same here, I can't sleep comfortably full night in a hammock and take a dog that needs to be 'closed up' to calm down at night.

I don't see maps or any sort of databook on your list?  might consider bringing an extra water bag for the dry sections, depending on how fast you plan on hiking. or just grab an empty soda (or whatever) bottle at the last resupply before the dry sections.  there are plenty of sections of the ct where you'll be above treeline and unable to bear bag. including nearly a 40 mile continuous stretch in the san juans.  not sure your hiking pace, or planned schedule or where you are used to hiking, but you'll probably find the hiking much easier than where you usually hike and thus able to hike longer days.   fyi, if you haven't seen it, this page is invaluable for ct planning: http://www.pmags.com/colorado-trail-end-to-end-guide-2 that + the data book is all the info you need."

Ultralight,3dipvj,mvmntsofthemind,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:40:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is true. You can account for this by looking up the elevation of the weather station you're getting data from, and then adjusting for the elevation difference between that point and where you'll be on the trail. http://www.onthesnow.com/news/a/15157/ask-a-weatherman--how-does-elevation-affect-temperature- tl;dr: 5.4F per 1000' (sunny) OR 3.3F per 1000' (w/ precip)  That being said, site selection will arguably affect temperature almost as much. If you have flexibility in selecting sites, you can hedge against colder weather. Or, if you know that you will be on an exposed site and have to camp there, (because it's designated for example), you can adjust accordingly."

Ultralight,3dipvj,mindftw,2,Thu Jul 16 20:41:00 2015 UTC,"A general UL philosophy is to take what you need and nothing more.  I feel like an ultralighter is much more likely to push the lower limits of a bag to save weight.

Do you plan on hiking in your down jacket and BOTH the long and short sleeve shirt?  Some of the clothing needs to be unchecked as worn and proper weights included.  Same for the solar charger - weight needs adding.  What about sleeping/spare clothing?  It's not listed, this will add to your pack weight.

Also, i don't like sleeping with layers at night (only planning on wearing shorts), so I was hoping a lower rated quilt would be a better alternative to more layers (and maybe shave a few oz?).  I think i will take your advice regarding the Bandana over towel.  Already updated the load out to reflect that.  Thank you!  Also, i have read the same complaint about the Sawyer Mini elsewhere.

Ultralight,3dc7zz,generationfourth,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:14:06 2015 UTC,Problem I have isn't so much the threading as the white gasket in the mini is compressible. If you crank the platy bag on to tight it will ride down outside the gasket and deform it (leaks). If you really tighten it down it will pop up inside of the platy bag neck and not seal at all.  Takes about 24hrs for the gasket to come back to the original shape.  Just replace it with a standard black rubber one and you're good to go.

Not for weight but for comfort. It failed. I was cold and bent and miserable. Thought I would go back to the ground, but found a lot of people praising longer hammocks, so I bought one. They were right, an 11 foot hammock is far more comfortable. But then you still need a tarp and a wide pad or underquilt $$$.   I really like the idea of just a tarp from a weight standpoint. But we are back to the uncomfortable (for me) ground.  I would suggest if you sleep well in the tent keep it.

I've camped all over the US, hot and cold weather, and only gone to ground when it was brutal cold.  I'll still do that.    Anyway, these are the salad days for hammock campers.  Stuff I used to invent on my own I can buy on Amazon now, in better quality, and have it delivered to my doorstep.  :)  OP, if your partner is a lover, go with the tent.

Ultralight,3da8uq,rverma87,3,Wed Jul 15 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"Is a hammock setup lighter or cheaper? Well, that's like asking ""how long is a piece of string?"". For about $230 you can have a really nice 11' hammock with a tarp and bugnet, including all the neccessary suspension, that's around 2lbs. Insulation is a bit more, if you want an underquilt (otherwise you're using a pad which is the same cost and weight as sleeping on the ground). A 3/4 length down underquilt is only a couple ounces more than the popular Thermarest pads.   Everything else is an advantage to the hammock. Site selection is much more varried. Comfort is obvious. They set up faster and easier, doubly so in the rain. Muddy, rocky, rot filled ground on a slope doesn't matter. A hammock doubles as a camp chair. You're more connected with nature because you wake up and immediately feel like you're outside, rather than in a tiny nylon house. If it rains you get to remain outside while dry instead of running into a doghouse. They're more customizable, which is kinda cool. The advantages in the Deep South during the hot months make hammocks the only option; tents are just too hot.  Someone is going to chime in about needing trees or being above treeline. People who hike in these areas are in the minority. Most people hike and camp around trees. In fact just about anything east of the Mississippi is suited well for hammocks."

The site selection sounds like a really big advantage. Nothing worse than a slanty, root-ridden campsite. And the rain too (PNW)."
Ultralight,3da8uq,AFlemeister,2,Wed Jul 15 16:13:39 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of a tarp from a weight standpoint, but having slept in my warbonnet black bird and underquilt, I will never willingly sleep in a tent again. I can't overstate how comfortable it is... I would set it up in my bedroom if my girlfriend and I could sleep in there comfortably.  However, to get it set up properly is quite expensive - ~330 for hammock and tarp, ~$220 for underquilt. The weight savings vs a tent and sleeping pad... minimal, if any for my hammock and tent setups (WBBB hammock and hubba hubba nx tent with thermarest neoair xlite) if you don't get an ultralight hammock."
Ultralight,3da8uq,AFlemeister,2,Wed Jul 15 16:04:29 2015 UTC,"Haha! Well excellent, I have yet to try a night in a hammock, I'm excited for it now!  Okay - have you ever used your NeoAir in your hammock? If yes, does it provide enough insulation or would you still go with the underquilt? In my mind, I would imagine the NeoAir helps flatten out the hammock for a more level sleep which seems like it would be advantageous!  Okay - so no real big advantage in weight savings, mostly comfort? I'm guessing an ENO doublenest doesn't qualify as an ultralight hammock."
Ultralight,3da8uq,mrjowee,3,Wed Jul 15 16:17:16 2015 UTC,"I may have misled you slightly... I actually used a self-inflating thermarest in the hammock before deciding to go for the underquilt. In 3 season camping, it was more than enough to keep me warm with a good sleeping bag (i used a down one rated for -7c). Probably a little overkill but better to be warmer than necessary. The main issue with a pad in a hammock is that it can move around, so unless you are comatose when you sleep, you may find you slip off your sleeping pad, opening you up to getting chilly or bitten by bugs.  The underquilt was a huge quality of life improvement from multiple standpoints. It'slighter than the self-inflating thermarest. It's warmer by a large margin. And the best part... it doesn't move at all when you move inside the hammock. If you're going to be a serious hammock camper, save up and get an underquilt, or investigate making your own for a little less money. They're well worth it. As an added bonus, I cut down on my sleeping bag weight because the underquilt is so warm - I use a lighter synthetic sleeping bag.  EDIT: I can't comment on the ENO because I'm unfamiliar with it but there are ultralight hammocks that weigh less than 12oz but this weight doesn't include a bug net (mandatory during most times when I can camp in Canada) or a tarp (you may not need it on most trips but you'll be glad to have it if you do so I always bring it anyway). I haven't crunched the numbers yet but I think if there are two people using a lightweight tent, it may work out to less weight per person, but the hammock is so much more comfortable I would gladly carry the extra weight."

They have some 3 and 4 person options which may suit having two of you plus a dog, but I don't have experience with any of them.  Would your dog be happy tied up under a simple tarp for a shelter?

I prefer cowboy camping, and tarping when necessary, but have accumulated various (non-ultralight) tents which are nice for buggy season (and spider proof). Love my MSR Hubba which is pretty lightweight, and Kelty Trail Logic TN, which is heavier but roomier (has a 3 person model), great views while keeping the bugs off, and you can put on the fly while still in the tent if it starts to rain (or full moon wakes you up). The 2 person is pretty large, and can fit 2 people and a dog as long as you leave your packs and gear outside (where spiders will crawl in them during the night?).  Lightweight is not generally as durable, and I don't think UL would work well with my dog. That beast ends up sleeping on top of me, no matter how much room she has, even when I bring her a nice, warm comfy bed. And she has torn multiple screens scratching because she wants out to potty in the middle of the night. I find it best to bring her a small bed and put it under the vestibule, but she often wonders at night, and still scratches hoping she can get in. My single wall tent is much better with the dog, thicker walls and no screen, but too hot most of the year. They call them 4 season tents, when really they are only good for 1 season?  In no way was my answer really relevant or helpful. So, stick with 3 season tent for great spider proofing, don't go too lightweight unless your dog is a saint, and most tents will be a major improvement to what you have. Look at outdoor gear clearance sections, sales and used gear."
Ultralight,3d7ra3,b_rad_ical,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:13:15 2015 UTC,"I'm a hammock person, but for tents in general: A two person tent will fit (surprise!) two people, with a little bit of space on the end to stow your packs - unless you're really tall. So definitely get at least a 3 person tent if you take the dog. Make sure the tent is tall enough to sit up in. Getting dressed when you can't sit up is frustrating at best. Dual and side entries are also nice to have. Makes it easier to get up without disturbing the other person. With ultralight tents the floor is not as durable and I'd be worried about punctures from the paws. So, if you want to take your dog inside, cut a CCF pad to size and put that down first. Though I guess you'd do that anyway for the insulation.    I think the Hubba Hubba NX might be too small for both of you and the dog. Do you always take the dog? If you do, you could either go up one size to the Mutha Hubba NX or - and this is what I would do - get a Hubba Hubba NX and the Hubba Gear Shed. This would give your dog plenty of space and you could leave it at home if you don't take the dog with you. For that to fit in your budget you'd have to get them on sale though. We paid $300 for the tent. No personal experience with Tarptent, but the Cloudburst 3 seems like a good choice also. Plenty of space and quite a bit cheaper, too.    Now, hammocks I will recommend to everyone, but try it out first. Get a net-less one from Dutch or make a tablecloth hammock and take a nap. I rarely sleep in my bed anymore, but not everyone likes it. There's also enclosed hammocks like this beauty."
Ultralight,3d7ra3,NumberslnSnow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:51:56 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of hammocks that come with fully enclosed bug nets. Warbonnet and Dream Hammocks are two good places to start, although there are many others. I also don't think it's true ""most"" people use hammocks, although us hangers are a growing percentage.   That being said, I don't recommend hammocks for folks with dogs, most find that it doesn't work out. Plus, you don't have the budget for two hammock setups. (For each person you need the hammock, suspension, tarp and underquilt)."
Ultralight,3d7ra3,mvmntsofthemind,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:47:31 2015 UTC,"I have camped in both a hammock and a tent with my dog (australian shepherd, ~50lbs) and SO. I'm from Canada as well, but prices are in US and do not include shipping.  The hammock I use is a Warbonnet Blackbird with the edge tarp and that will cost you around $330 for the hammock and tarp for one person. I typically will leash my dog to the hammock strap unless it's really buggy in which case I'll bring him into the hammock with me. I use a light weight sleeping bag and put that on the bottom to prevent his claws from going through and it works decently. I also use an underquilt underneath it (appx $220 from hammockgear) and it gets damn hot with the pooch in there which is why he and I both prefer he sleep outside. You can use a sleeping pad inside the hammock to keep you warm (some form of insulation is required even in summer for bugs and convective heat loss, research it before buying a hammock) and I don't think having the dog and a sleeping pad in the bottom of a hammock would work well, so hopefully he's fine to sleep outside if you decide to get a hammock and wait on the underquilt. The hennessy hammock is a cheaper option for hammock camping because it comes with a tarp (smaller than the edge tarp). I found the Blackbird to be more comfortable by far.  My girlfriend has a hubba hubba nx (she already had it when we got together so I don't know how much it costs off the top of my head) and we've both spent a couple trips this year camping in it so far. The dog fit in the tent decently, provided you don't mind having some part of the dog sleeping on you. There is a little room at the bottom of the tent, but my dog is a cuddle monster and has to be touching us in some manner so he doesn't use the space effectively. The vextibule is another option but I don't know how I'd solve the issue of keeping him leashed without ripping out the peg keeping the vestibule open when he gets restless, or how to leash him in the first place from inside the tent. It probably depends on the dog. The tent is actually amazing (I'm a huge fan of hammocks but this is the only tent I have really liked for backpacking). A tarp would be lighter but would not offer bug protection unless you got a bivy or bug net. A bivy would be required for a tarp in my opinion, at least to protect your sleeping pad."

If it's paracord you can remove the kern and take only the mantle to save weight. use the kern strands as guylines (see #4) 6) a minibic is better than matches.  waterproof and even if empty can use the flint to light a busted jetboil"

No no, the 50 ft. of 550 paracord is for bear-bagging, the rope is for the tent. Would the mantle be sturdy enough by itself? Point taken."

Your choice of water treatment will cause you to carry extra water since iodine takes time to work. A Sawyer squeeze will allow you to carry only the water you need to drink between streams. On AT, water is plentiful except for a few 10 mile dry ridges. Do your research and identify if any of stretch has those.  I would look around the house for a large daypack. You might be able to get all of your stuff in it. It's far nicer to do the AT with a frameless, hipbeltless pack as you get far less sweatier.  Finally do you have benadryl or some other anti-histamine? An epipen only works for a short time. Talk to your doctor about a more complete solution.  I would also hike with a cotton dress-shirt. It's much better suited to the climate than a 100% polyester shirt.  Treat your clothes and backpack with permetherin to minimize ticks.  Consider using trail runners or plain running shoes that you already own; they'll breathe far better than gore-tex boots. You should be more concerned with how you will deal with the heat and humidity."

Putting compressible things such as sleeping bags into stuff sacks may help with the issue... or just carrying less/more compact crap.   From the looks of it on Amazon, the central frame is similar in design to the Kelty Redwing and Exped Lighting series. The Redwing gets around the burrito effect by having a hard sheet of plastic on the back panel. So, you could grab a piece of spare plastic and cut it to shape.  There is a similar technique that many UL frameless packs have to take. You can fit a foam pad into the pack closest to the pack to help retain form. Something like this: http://www.rei.com/product/829826/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sol-sleeping-pad or http://gossamergear.com/nightlight-sleeping-pad-torso-length.html .

Ultralight,3cy22c,Gcobb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:06:59 2015 UTC,"It really depends. If you are a ""violet sleeper"" you might try Synmat. The Synmat's outer baffles are slightly larger that the ones in the middle which can help keep you contained a bit. I actually bought a Synmat UL7 and returned it. I didn't like the vertical baffles, felt like sleeping on a pool float. Ended up buying a NeoAir and find its horizontal baffles much more comfortable. I'd suggest trying before buying or ordering from a place with an easy return policy to be able to try both styles out and seeing what you find the most comfortable."
Ultralight,3cy22c,AdventurousAtheist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:53:54 2015 UTC,My husband and I love our exped ul7s.  There are extremely comfortable. Get the schnozel pump bag for them.
Ultralight,3cy22c,thesneakymonkey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:01:17 2015 UTC,"I've used the Synmat UL7 forever. I have never had any real issues with it, If you decide to get it and don't mind spending a little extra get the waterproof bag they sell with it.. totally worth it I can set mine up in about 45 seconds. I do know that one of the complaints about it is that partitions inside will break if the get too much pressure. But like I said I haven't had any real issue with it. Another plus over the Neo Air is that its not made out of the same crinkly material as the Neo Air. So it doesn't sound like you are rolling around on a bag of potato chips all night."
Ultralight,3cy22c,uptillious_prick,0,Sun Jul 12 20:58:47 2015 UTC,"The neoair isn't actually 25"", if that matters."
Ultralight,3cy22c,mvmntsofthemind,0,Sun Jul 12 00:44:20 2015 UTC,"I did a lot of research and bought a couple sleeping mats only to return them. The one I finally settled on, which ultra lighters will scoff at was the thermarest neoair camper at 1 pound, 14 oz you get a size large which has the 25"" width. Its a heavier pad, but as a side sleeper I needed something that will save my hips/shoulders. A lot of these thicker/more comfortable pads is that they are just so god damn loud. I'm talking it sounds like you're rolling around on bags of potato chips. Anyone camping within 500 feet of your tent will hear you all night long. That isn't the case with the camp. Most comfortable pad I've ever slept on."
Ultralight,3cx916,mrlich,3,Sat Jul 11 16:15:30 2015 UTC,"Well, if you already have most of the gear, try packing your bags and see if it fits. If it doesn't then you know where you need to improve.   I do think it's possible, because for backpacking I obviously only have one 45 liter pack. I've taken it on planes before without a problem. And then you can have a second one for business/casual clothes and other things you need for normal life."
Ultralight,3cx916,paleal3s,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:27:34 2015 UTC,"I don't have most of the gear yet, but it does sound like it should be doable."
Ultralight,3cx916,4amPhilosophy,2,Sun Jul 12 04:25:36 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's very doable. A carry on suitcase is roughly the same size as a backpacking pack, have all your camping stuff in one and all your normal stuff in the other. Tent poles might be tricky depending on the tent, but I think most should fit in just fine though. Cheap tents, sleeping bags, and sleeping pads tend to be very bulky so that's where you might run in to problems. You can definitely find less bulky options without breaking the bank. If money isn't an issue then you can absolutely can get a small set up and have room to spare likely."
Ultralight,3cx916,Thexorretor,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:01:10 2015 UTC,"Well, I won't say that money is NO problem, but it likely won't be the limiting factor. Thanks for the response!"
Ultralight,3cx916,alexstepka,2,Sun Jul 12 04:26:50 2015 UTC,"Size-wise, it seems like it would work. I would avoid cubed-fiber stuff as the material doesn't pack that well. Sil-nylon will stuff to a smaller size. My tarp-tent uses carbon fiber poles that should pass TSA muster (very small, lightweight, not at all a possible weapon). You might run into trouble with the stakes though. I might bring cheap stakes that I wouldn't mind losing. You could also add ~8 ft of accessory cord instead of stakes. Tie off to roots,bushes, rocks with a truckers hitch. Often I'll just wrap it around a rock a bunch of times and then move the rock back to get tension. For an even stupider trick, just put large rock inside the tent at the tent corners. Stupid, but works."
Ultralight,3cx916,alexstepka,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info! I'll look into the sil-nylon and carbon fiver poles. I often don't bother staking my tent unless I'm in a high wind area. My gear is usually enough to weigh things down, but I like the cordage ideas!"

Ultralight,3ctdag,mvmntsofthemind,6,Fri Jul 10 16:50:16 2015 UTC,"Light and fast, and shoulder season temperatures and conditions in late November don't make the best bed mates.    In particular, remember that the days are going to be extremely short- 9.5 hours between sunrise and sunset.  10 miles a day with only 9.5 hours of daylight to do it in doesn't leave you much wiggle room.  The elevation gains and losses on top of the distance will further slow you down.  You'll have to be up and hiking well before sunrise every day, and breaking down camp in those temperatures isn't something that one can do efficiently and quickly.    Honestly, without more experience in these conditions, I think that there is a good chance that you are biting off more than you can chew.  I would strongly suggest picking an easier alternative that will let you gain shoulder season experience in the backountry, which will better enable you to decide for yourself weather a trip like this is feasible for you in November in the future."
Ultralight,3ctdag,DSettahr,3,Fri Jul 10 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"Well, fast n light is all relative. I was merely stating that I am posting it here because I share common goals and style with folks here, as opposed to other camping and hiking subreddits. I am aware of the shorter days, I neglected to list that information, but it's part of my environmental conditions report.  I agree about not biting off more than I can chew. That is what this trip is for. I have more ambitious hikes saved for the future, like the Presicat loop, etc. You reach a point where you have to go and do and that is where I'm at. The mileage is a tad ambitious, but that is by design based on good circumstances. It is a loop hike, with many intersecting and alternative routes, bailout points, etc and my first night camp will be just a few miles up trail, so that if things are FUBAR, I haven't overcommitted. If I need to adjust for mileage or weather, I can turn back early, branch off, go to a basecamp/out n back style, etc.   I've hiked in shoulder season before, and I've hiked over snow. This is just a bit colder than I've seen previously, so I'm looking for blind spots in my gearlist/skillset. I'll be researching the area more in the months ahead and reviewing a lot of winter hiking trip reports to acquire and refine my skillset."

Ultralight,3ctdag,DontWorry-AboutIt,2,Sat Jul 11 00:01:56 2015 UTC,"Are you sure about hammocking up there?  I've hiked most of that route in pieces and the forest at high elevation tends to be krummholtz - not the type of tree that will support you.  I'm not a hammock user though but it would be worth asking around to plan your campsites out a bit.  Are you planning on descending down for camp each night, like to thirteen falls? If so that would work.    The biggest challenge in shoulder season in the whites is footwear - not cold enough for boots and too cold/wet for trail runners alone.  Neoprene socks and knee length gaiters can add a lot of warmth to your altra's (I'm wearing lone peaks right now...) but they will likely freeze at night.  A way around that is to use some hard sided small nalgenes with boiling water to thaw them in the morning. Fill the bottles and stuff them in your shoes while you eat breakfast.  Down booties can be nice for the mean time. You can sleep with the shoes too but I think that would be kind of weird in a hammock, maybe try it out first in a backyard test?    The other challenge is wet hiking clothes.  It's pretty hard to hike in the whites and not sweat out your hiking clothes, definitely bring a plastic bag to sleep with them so those don't freeze.  If your sleep system is significantly warmer than the environment you can sleep with them on but your bag will be damp, ok for 1 night not so great for 2."
Ultralight,3ctdag,DontWorry-AboutIt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:16:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the very specific advice, that is going to be a huge help.  Site selection will be one of the unique challenges of this route. I have done some research, enough to know it is possible, but not enough to know all the details. Several folks on hammockforums have done the loop, including Sintax77 who posted a video gps track which shows where he found spots to hang. I will be looking into the region more in detail and coming up with a plan for how to approach the loop and where to camp. I will likely be going down and up each night.  It looks like I am going to be sleeping with a lot of crap in my hammock, which I have done before. On my last trip I had a slew of electronics, spare clothes, water filter, etc that I kept within my quilt, and while it's not ideal, I had no issues sleeping.  I think I will bring a few grocery bags or something of the like, and keep them loosely closed so that they can stay warm and hopefully vent a little moisture during the night as well. Not enough to dampen my down too much.   Glad to hear from a fellow lone peak wearer! I was fortunate enough to pickup a hardly used pair in my exact size on FB for half price. I am not 100% sure I'm going to use them, but my test runs so far look promising. I am definitely getting heavier gaiters, and will look into neoprene socks as well, not too familiar with them.  I am loathe to bring along a nalgne, but I did it last year, and it would be a good hedge against the cold again as I'm learning.  Last year I found that the smartwool 200 baselayer + cap4 hoody + wind shirt was a tad too warm for me hiking in 30-35F during the day, so I am thinking it may be perfect for the conditions I am going to encounter, but I'm still tempted to switch out the cap4 for a heavier R1, but maybe that's not wise."
Ultralight,3ctdag,zygozephyr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:28:13 2015 UTC,"Glad to help, looks like you're checking into the hanging situation.  3 days for that loop is plenty of time if you're coming in prepared so descending to camp isn't make or break either.  I hike in the whites year round, including single digit daytime temps and usually stay warm while moving in just a baselayer and glove liners while going uphill, it's the stopping and hanging out or the windy ridges that will get you or descending in wet clothes.    If there's snow on the ground and sub freezing daytime temperatures I would take softshell pants + gaiters, a thin long sleeve top, glove liners, heavier waterproof gloves, a hard shell and a 12-16 ounce puffy for stopping, plus sleeping clothes.  Wear the hard shell if you're cold while moving and the puffy for stopping more than a few minutes.  No snow and I'd take regular hiking pants, no gaiters and the same setup for the same temperatures.  I think you're over thinking it with all the cap4/R1 stuff, I don't find those layers useful for moving since they'll get wet.  A shell will get damp but still be warm.  Since you'll be above treeline quite a bit definitely look into full face coverage balaclava and possibly goggles if the higher summits forecast is for sustained winds more than 30 mph or so with sub freezing temperatures.  If the forecast is cold and windy you can get frostbite to exposed skin in a few minutes.  A shell with a really good hood that cinches around your face is key as well.    The neoprene socks and gaiters add a lot of warmth, your feet will get wet but they'll stay warm with the gaiters too.  Plastic grocery bags will be fine, they won't dry even if you leave them open so don't worry about it.  Sometimes you can hike things dry if your pacing is good."
Ultralight,3ctdag,returno,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:14:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure on some of your gear (brand name and product name are kinda hard to tell if something is a rain shell, micropuff, etc).  What I can say, having done the pemi loop a few times (even ran it in an ultra) is that the exposed sections can get brutally windy. You're going to want to have a good wind/rain shell for that. Worse case there are descents down off the ridge relatively frequently."

Ultralight,3col0c,gorlami44,3,Thu Jul 9 18:02:58 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna reply here since there's more comments than /r/bicycling.  My favorites are:    Stow spare cables in my handlebars. Just pop out the bar ends and thread them in there looped a couple of times. They stay put and are there when I need them.    Neat trick, I'll have to start doing that.    A tennis ball canister fits in a bottle cage, too, and can be used to carry CLIF bars, a windshirt, spare tubes, trail mix, or anything else you’d like. Keep tools in an empty peanut butter container instead, since the plastic is burlier and won’t crack from a rattling multitool.    Why didn't I think of this before?!    There are more libraries in the US than there are McDonalds. A library is a safe, warm, and quiet place to take a break, watch a movie, plan out a route, buy a used book, or escape the rain.    If this is true, there may yet be hope left for humanity.   40-49. Ditch []   Lol.    Wear cycling gloves even if you don’t need the padding. They make thin gel-free gloves. Every time I’ve crashed, I’ve scraped my hands on the ground, and I was only wearing gloves about half the time.     So true. Last time I decided to forgo gloves and fell sideways trying to clip out. Nasty, deep cut across the palm of my hand (luckily wasn't infected).    Brace your wheel between your legs, put a sturdy piece of wood like a 2×4 on your cassette’s left side, and hit it down with a rock to release the cassette without a cassette wrench. You’ll still need the little lockring tool, but an auto parts store will have an adjustable wrench to grab the lockring tool.    I would like to see a video demonstration of this.  Here are a few I've learned myself (not from touring, only bike commuting). If I think of more I'll add them:   Floss makes for some strong, inexpensive sewing thread. I usually put a few small needles and needle threader (hate threading by hand) inside the floss case (take the top cover off). Get loctite and anti-seize in glue stick form instead of liquid/paste. Much less messy to apply and saves waste. You can wrap your own DIY tape rolls (Gorilla, electrical, leukotape) around some cotter pins found at H/W stores. Cheap and you can wrap a lot of tape that in small amount of space. Gorilla tape makes some great improvised spacers when you need to increase your bar/tube diameter (to mount something onto). Strong and relatively waterproof, and for the life of me I can't find any stores that sell rubber straps/webbing."

Ultralight,3cp4at,kenrubin,2,Thu Jul 9 17:18:01 2015 UTC,I don't understand. The Arc Blast is an external frame too. I have one. There is frame structure and it is outside the pack.
Ultralight,3cp4at,Thepher,1 point,Fri Jul 10 09:36:24 2015 UTC,The difference is how the frames are used.  The Arc Blast frame is not really carrying and distributing the load or at least not to the same extent.  The Arc Blast frame is attached to the bag.  The Vargo bag is attached to the frame.
Ultralight,3cp4at,Thepher,2,Sun Jul 12 14:16:40 2015 UTC,"Guess that depends how you use the gear. I ordered my Blast so I could wear how I like: 99% weight transferred to hips, and shoulder straps attach above shoulder and just keep it stable.  So for me, it's a solid, framed pack. It relies on the frame. The frame gives it its shape and transfers as much weight as you want. The frame creates a nice gap between the pack and your back, so you don't get a huge sweat spot on your back.  So... I still don't get what you're getting at."
Ultralight,3cp4at,Thepher,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:34:17 2015 UTC,"Just mixing it up--not picking favorites.    Perhaps I'll never use the Vargo again.  Perhaps I'll find the extra rigidity is worth the 300g.  The only way to know is to give it a try.  Though, I don't think you're giving the extra structure of the Vargo its fair due.  Did you go to the site and check it out?  It really is orders of magnitude more significant.  You can pick up the pack, fully loaded, by one corner of the frame and it does not flex.  The bag literally hangs from two top support-rings and straps to the frame along its length.  The welding is quality work, the titanium is beautiful, and the suspension system is (heavy, but) vastly superior (I have a feeling that most of the extra weight is in the suspension).  Another difference between the bags is the zippered entry on the Vargo.  I like the ability to place the pack on the ground and be able to see all the stuff in there rather than rummaging around the bottom of the pack through a roll top.  So, if that turns out a plus, perhaps I'll get an Arc-zip and give that one a try next.  All that said, I can't imagine its worth 300g (as I am a card-carrying gram weenie).  But in the end, I just like to mix it up and try the different products out there for myself.  My last big hike I took a Duluth Isle Royale, which is definitely not UL!  That monster was >4lbs of waxed canvas goodness and I'll never do that to myself again.   Take care."

Ultralight,3cp4at,Thepher,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:41:14 2015 UTC,Ive been switching back and fourth my last few trips between a 10oz MLD pack and a 30 oz REI internal frame pack. Im still on decided as to which I prefer.   Certainly if I am carrying less than 12lbs or more than 20lbs the choice is very easy but more of the time my actual pack weight with food and all falls in that range. I haven't had the internal frame one for very long but I think at the moment it is my preference because it is more comfortable and I can use the hipbelt to transfer the weight.

As such, I never pack much water, just filter and drink as i go. depending on where i am, i may top up my 1l HDPE bottle, or just fill the(swayer mini) 16oz bag up a little and carry on.  on the pack frame. your not carrying very much weight as is, i always go frame-less(HMG summit pack) no comfort problems. its all about how you pack the bag.  bundling your pad/clothing/sleeping bag correctly will provide you with a solid (and comfy) bag shape."
Ultralight,3cmxie,mmm_migas,7,Thu Jul 9 03:49:12 2015 UTC,Why the cot?
Ultralight,3cmxie,Kaiuk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:22:44 2015 UTC,"I'm open to options so I'm not attached to it by any means. But in any case, it's super comfy and ergonomic. I may consider a quilt and pad down the line."
Ultralight,3cmxie,mindftw,8,Tue Jul 14 00:08:47 2015 UTC,"I""m sure you're aware of this, but the cot isn't going to be a popular option around here - looks like it weighs almost 3 pounds by itself (that's half of some folk's base weight). But I say hike your own hike - if that's your thing then cool. You can still save weight on your shelter and be light enough to enjoy yourself.  As far as shelters go, I have the Six Moon Designs Haven Tarp (two man tarp, similar to the Deschutes best I can tell) paired with their two man bug net and I love both of them. Having the flexibility to leave the bug net at home during the winter/during high altitude camping is really nice and it has held up to some strong winds over the past few trips.  For footprint/ground cover the Gossamer Gear Polycro works great - I use one when it's just me and two when there's two folks in the tarp."
Ultralight,3cmxie,Thexorretor,2,Thu Jul 9 16:00:55 2015 UTC,"Interesting choice. I would think the cot would ruin the groundsheet very quickly, especially something polycro. I might stick with tarps without floors for that reason. The bathtub floor is less important as you are already raised off the ground. You probably also need a sleeping pad as it'll get cold without one."
Ultralight,3cmxie,Gcobb,2,Thu Jul 9 14:59:46 2015 UTC,Personally I prefer a simple rectangle tarp because it's more versatile. You can set it up in dozens of configurations. The polycro is an awesome groundsheet and will give you plenty of protection. A bathtub floor is overkill for most situations and so is a full bugnet. I prefer a headnet and just curl up under my EE quilt.
Ultralight,3cmxie,Gcobb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:13:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, I love the versatility of tarps and how you can create modular shelter. I'm still undecided at the moment but I'll certainly start with a simple tarp and go from there.   Speaking of your EE quilt, that's another thing I'm looking at as an alternative to my UL cot. Which bag do you have and which pad?"
Ultralight,3ckkaa,Mattho,7,Wed Jul 8 17:08:50 2015 UTC,"Appears to have a high vent near the head, which should help reduce condensation, but overall amount of ventilation seems quite limited, making condensation a concern after all. If you look at the video the door underneath the fly appears to be solid, not netted. They call it a vestibule, but that is beyond generous given how tiny it is, so space for gear and for not feeling claustrophobic is very limited.  I worry about getting a tent that seems to have very limited reviews, at least in English. Especially given potential concerns about condensation and space.  The six moon designs skyscape scout is a similar weight and price and is generally well regarded. It is in stock on their site and I believe they do ship internationally, but you probably can't find it at a retail store even in the US.  http://www.sixmoondesigns.com/tents/SkyscapeScout.html"

I heard of some folks having trouble with the Protrail early in the season on the AT. I'd just say to try to keep the wind direction in mind when pitching, look for any natural cover you can, and try to double up stakes and lines.   If the lines are slipping in the linelocs, maybe try wrapping the free end like this: http://www.zpacks.com/images/backpacks/arc_haul/arc_knot_l.jpg  If you're using shepherd's hooks, either be sure that you're smashing both the long and short end of the crook into the ground, or upgrade to something burlier like a y stake.  Best of luck, the wind is always a challenge!"
Ultralight,3cjpzs,pshyeahrightbird,2,Thu Jul 9 00:33:25 2015 UTC,"Tie off to a stake or dead branch and then put rocks on top of the line to get your tension. The wind gust may lift up the rock, but when it dies the rock will return to the ground and stay taut.  This also takes a lot of pressure off of the stakes and allows for give without failure.  Another point - maybe just take down the tent if it isn't raining?"
Ultralight,3cjpzs,generationfourth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:56:09 2015 UTC,"Guy lines help a lot, also the direction of the tent vs. wind direction. What I've done with other tents is where the rain fly meets the ground I block the opening with 5-12"" tall rocks to prevent wind from entering underneath the fly.   Are you using the extra guy line at the head of the tent? This worries me as I just ordered a protrail yesterday!"
Ultralight,3cjpzs,shreddykruger,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"I had one of these before getting my hexamid. As mentioned paying attention to which direction the wind is coming is pretty key. I always would point the foot or head towards the wind depending on how much condensation I was expecting so I could get more airflow if needed.  I always pitched it with 6-10 stakes depending on the situation. More wind = more stakes. The extra tie outs will help strengthen the tent quite a bit, as well as give you a ton more room inside (I've had a second person in there once after a rainy afternoon and we were fine!) You should really see the catenary ridgeline tighten up if you have it right.  I supplemented the easton nano stakes with some MSR groundhogs. I have ti shepherds but wouldn't use them for this tent since you need good holding power and tension I think.  Hope this all helps, those are pretty bomber shelters.

I don't think an ordinary uninsulated stove gets quite that hot...not that anyone should breathe the vapors....do the first burn outdoors for sure.    I appreciate the open-source plans, and I'm tempted to like that stove....  Maybe you could make stove that in an hour if you had all 9 of those metal working tools handy.  If not, it might be a simpler to just drill holes in the bottom of a soup can, or steel box of some sort ( like the ones they use in packaging certain teas, etc.)  since it ought to do basically the same thing.  Yeah it's not collapsible, but maybe that makes it more rugged, and maybe you use that space to store dry kindling or something."

Ultralight,3cip3t,tinkerer13,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:34:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at higher temperatures, the Zinc would have to react with something, if nothing else, to zinc oxide.  I guess what's dangerous is that it makes such a fine dust.  Zinc is an essential mineral, so I'm not used to thinking of it as toxic, but I guess it's more of a micro-nutrient.  It looks like when the dose gets up to > 1 mg/kg of body weight it can start to cause issues.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_toxicity#High_levels_of_intake_by_humans  For some reason, if you throw zinc in a fire, apparently the zinc doesn't just oxidize (and flake off as a ceramic), as one might expect a metal to do, but rather, enough of it goes into the air to be dangerous to breathe.    Zinc has a very low boiling point for a metal, and maybe this has something to do with it.  I don't know, maybe boiling is a process by which it ""atomizes"" the zinc and makes it an ""aerosol""?  Or maybe there's just something about the way it oxidizes that is dusty. Basically, I guess a galvanized surface contains [grams] worth of zinc, and the nature of dust being what it is, and the lungs being what they are, I can see how even one good whiff of dust could move 100's of mg of zinc into the body.  Mechanically it's a trivial amount, but biochemically it's a huge amount.  Nasty!  This is a lot more dangerous than I realized!"

Ultralight,3cduvt,THE_BOKEH_BLOKE,3,Tue Jul 7 12:14:18 2015 UTC,I made a supercat stove and picked up a titanium mug.  Much better than the jetboil.  I'd even say it's charming.

Ultralight,3cduvt,jbBU,3,Tue Jul 7 12:46:53 2015 UTC,"On a short trip, an alcohol stove is much lighter. After several days the weight savings aren't as great because they use more fuel, however the length in which they are advantageous varies from stove to stove (and what you're comparing it to). In this case even the old style brass Trangia would come out on top, and it's considered hefty in the alcohol stove world. At 11.9oz for the entire cool kit including the stove, and about .75oz of fuel per day, you'd only be saving a couple ounces. But if it where a two day trip it would be much more. Again, according to several redditors it's a bad idea, because you're going to burn down the forest if you use one.   Of course if you're actually cooking, and not just boiling water, it's a whole different story."
Ultralight,3cduvt,tecneeq,2,Tue Jul 7 13:11:46 2015 UTC,My best estimate is that I use about .25oz of fuel per meal with the jetboil.  So .75 isn't too bad.  I've also been thinking of trying stoveless.  There's also this thing: http://www.vertexoutdoors.com/

Get a portable solar panel and charge it as you go. If you want pace/heart rate probably a GPS watch, would do. Many will last 14 hrs before a recarge, otherwise larger handheld GPS have a more robust batt life."
Ultralight,3cbg3m,Ageless3,2,Mon Jul 6 19:22:00 2015 UTC,"Suunto Ambit 2S GPS watch can do what your after, only lasts 2~2.5 days on lowest accuracy setting though. Battery isn't very big (240 mAh) so a small portable battery recharges it quick and easy. Full charge well before I go to bed at night if I hook it up when I'm setting up camp.    It gets you within 25m which is fine for pretty much anything, unless you're relying on Elevation for something.    Very Very easy to record a POI/Waypoint. Can get heart rate chest strap. Only way to count steps would be Distance / Average stride (i.e. not good.) But the watch can do that for you and display it. You can pre-load (and navigate to) Waypoints, as well as have tracks loaded (very basic display) but only a max of 100 waypoints.    Biggest down side is the clip for download/power. People have reported them failing a bit. I've taken my cord on probably 50 days of hiking so far and haven't had a problem with it. It sits in a 'safe' place in my pack though (with phone etc.)    This watch might allow you to get away without a chest strap for heart rate, it's worth watching the add either way"

There is a substantial decrease in performance associated with making something wearable... the convenience is good when you are in town, but out in the wilderness you are already going to be carrying all of your supplies with you.  If your #1 focus is battery life, you do not want a wearable.   What I do is I use a Garmin eTrex 30, and put it in a MOLLE pouch attached to my shoulder strap, or put it in one of my hip belt pockets (but I normally use the shoulder, since that means i can put more snacks and stuff on my belt). Then, when I come to a crossing or similar navigational question, I pull it out, power it on, and read it, before turning it off again. All without having to take off my pack! Battery life on 2AAs should be sufficient for a week, but I would carry at least 2 more AAs, just in case. I use rechargeable batteries so I don't pollute.  EDIT: eTrex 30, like many other GPS models, supports waypoint creation, both at home with a computer, and on the trail using the shitty interface.   Have you considered just buying 2 or 3 extra batteries for your phone and using a GPS app?"
Ultralight,3cbg3m,Keldoclock,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:30:37 2015 UTC,"Going to recommend a Spot tracker also. They aren't wearable exactly, and are suppose to have a clear view of the sky, but there aren't many other GPS tracker options out there.   In the Bikepacking community (among other ultra racing scenes), they are used to track people to ensure they are on course, find out who is in the lead, etc. There are a couple races still going on that you can check out here: http://trackleaders.com/  Battery wise, mine will last 2+ weeks without a problem. They are pretty durable and waterproof. Downside is that you have to pay a subscription (150$ for a year or 15$ for a month). There is also no 'mark location' feature, but the gps tracks that you can look at afterwards have timestamps, so you can mark down timestamps and look them up afterwards. Hey look, they have a OK checkin feature that will mark locations.   Edit: Do note that for disposables, you HAVE to use lithium batteries."

Are you sure the pack is too big? A lot of ""ultralight"" packs people use for the Sierra are ULAs and they are pretty similar in size. A lot of UL packs don't have the support to be comfortable either with a 15-16lb base weight + bear can.   How many days of food are you carrying at a time? For instance I agree the Mariposa is a nice pack, I'm using it on my PCT hike, but it gets uncomfortable fast if you have to load a lot of food in and have a lot of stuff you need to fit your bear can around.   What hike are you doing in the Sierra? JMT? High Sierra Trail?

Aside from having to get a lot stronger, I really need to shave off a couple more pounds from my base weight for SHR cross country. I am having all the questions you're having so I'm thankful for your reply!  I pack the deuter by leaving the lid off of the bear can and packing in and around it. Deuter's are very conservative with their ratings. My older 35l deuter is more like a 45-50, and the ACT Lite 65+10 is definitely a 75-80l pack. For the first part I will need to carry around 7 days worth of food. After that it will be 4-5 at most.  With 5x worth of supply there is extra room up top and around the sides. I felt even with 2 more days worth of supply the pack would still be on the larger side. I nearly cinch the top lid all the way down the front strap after a couple of days passes.   This is what I brought: http://lighterpack.com/r/7elk21  I'm making adjustments to it, namely the sleeping bag will be replaced with a 20 oz. quilt.

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your goals), that general sort of pie-in-the-sky speculation is about where the similarities end.    My goal as a backpacker isn't just to go into the outdoors and survive. My goal is usually to cover some certain distance, see some of the natural sights, and have a non-suffering experience. So, I carry what I need to accomplish the goals of that trip.   So, I carry a shelter because I don't want to stop hiking halfway through a day and go through the long, arduous process of creating a shelter from natural materials for the night. If I don't bring a sleeping mat, I'd need to harvest pine boroughs to make one--again more time, and also limiting your campsites, and (if I can't sleep for multiple nights in a row) it's a matter of  increased suffering. So I bring a mat.  It can go on and on. Everything you bring has a weight and a utility. You balance those aspects to go the fastest.

Ultralight,3cd5sr,WhitleyStrieber,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"I enjoy using a medium-ass knife like a mora or izula. They make a great companion with a small woodstove and can process damp deadfall into good firewood with relative ease, and I get a big kick out of practicing these more traditional skills vs firing up a canister stove. However, it can take up to an hour in poor conditions to get the thing up and running and water boiled, so I would never consider it for a thru hike of any sort."
Ultralight,3cd5sr,DontWorry-AboutIt,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:30:03 2015 UTC,"Fear, rather than know-how, drives much of the activity on r/survival. If you enter the wilderness with fear, you are already at a disadvantage because you are in opposition to your situation rather than in harmony with it. Fear tends to lead to self-fulfilling prophecy, where you create danger from your tunnel vision and invite trouble through your reactivity and lack of groundedness. Fearful people tend to be more destructive, as they seek to eliminate the sources of their fear but usually only muster the will to face off against weaker beings.  A big, heavy knife doesn't belong in ultralight backpacking gear. For the most part, a big, heavy knife isn't necessary in wilderness travel; but in situations where it might serve you better than a modest bushcraft knife you wouldn't be carrying ultralight gear, you'd be using the full apparatus including hunting gear and/or a bucksaw or axe.  I carry a Mora, as with it I can perform almost any bushcraft task I might need to perform. I'd carry a lovely bushcraft knife if I were going to use it for much more than prying peanut butter out of a jar; but then the grip and blade would each only be as long as the width of my palm.  Not only are big knives not necessary, they can put you at quite a disadvantage:   The thickness of the blade makes it more difficult to slice shingles or baton kindling from a thick branch. The ability to shave multiple fine curves on a feather stick (which in dire cases could be critical to survival) is severely diminished by a thick double-grind (rather than Skandi) blade. Big blades tend to have more of a shoulder in the blade, which gets lodged in wood you're trying to cut through, and which doesn't allow fine angles of work. The depth of the blade and the double grind makes woodcraft much more difficult. It will be harder or impossible to cut certain notches in wood to fashion tools. The weight of the knife if worn on the hip can lead to imbalance in walking, and therefore injury. If not tied down, the knife can rub or cause bruising, or at least annoyance. The hiker is carrying extra weight for little useful purpose. A knife that protrudes away from the body can lead to dangerous snags, and depending on how it's rigged (e.g., hanging down from the waist, tucked in the small of the back, attached to a packstrap, etc.) can be an impalement hazard if you fall. One area where a large knife is superior is in hacking operations, like chopping down saplings. But the movements required for these operations are broad and fatiguing — not a good combination when wielding a blade. The potential for injury is much higher than making a single cut on a smaller sapling or finding other ways to gather the materials you need."
Ultralight,3cd5sr,Askii,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:39:27 2015 UTC,"I carry a big-ish knife, a Buck redpoint.  My trips usually involve fishing, and I like to have a sharp knife that is easy to hold to clean fish.  I like to be somewhat minimalist in my purchases and the amount of gear I have.  I'd rather have one knife, that is light enough for ultralight trips, but large enough for other uses, rather than having an array of specialized ultralight knives.   This knife is what they had in a local store, it seemed ok.  I use it car camping, canoeing, packrafting, day fishing trips, around the house, in the garden, and yes, on ultralight backpacking trips.  On most ultralight trips I've found a blade to not be necessary, but I like to bring one anyway, to clean fish if nothing else.  I've tried the razorblade in a tiny tyvek sheeth, and honestly, I found it a bit of a pain in the ass."

I had to use a lot more fiberglass to make up for that gap between the cans so it had a higher resistance that forced more pressure to build in the main chamber causing a huge jet to shoot out the single pressure hole. I added three more to help equalize pressure better and for better heat distribution because of that. I'll have to do a another stove that is completely in-line with Hiram's design."

I could go to every AT shelter in the area and find a scorch or burn mark on the floor, not all from alcohol stoves but I'll bet quite a few of them are.  This is money and time being spent by the local trail organization to deal with carelessness-while you may be super careful and respectful of the environment not everyone else is.

Ultralight,3bvkfi,guindon30,3,Thu Jul 2 23:59:56 2015 UTC,"I've had a hubba hubba since 2009. I've used it in some pretty bad weather and without a footprint.

Ultralight,3bvkfi,tchomptchomp,6,Tue Jul 7 22:54:52 2015 UTC,I would take a hard look at Henry Shire's 2-man TarpTents. In particular the stratospire 2.   http://www.tarptent.com/stratospire2.html
Ultralight,3bvkfi,Tmblackflag,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:08:13 2015 UTC,"I've got the Stratospire. It's tough and rugged enough for the rocky terrains OP intends to travel with it. However, the amount of area needed to pitch the Stratospire is massive, which can be a problem in rocky areas where it's difficult to find a large area of smooth, flat ground. Just double-check the ground dimensions of it on the TT site to get a realistic idea."
Ultralight,3bvkfi,Docano,2,Mon Jul 6 21:49:28 2015 UTC,I have the older Hubba Hubba. It's been pretty reliable as a car camping tent and I haven't had any issues with the floor ripping. On rocks you might have more issues.  Like /u/WinSomeLoseNone said though... definitely not worth $200 for the older model with no poles. I would maybe offer $50 if you are trying to start out cheap. If you want something good that will last and be light /u/Tmblackflag's suggestion of looking at the Tarp Tents is good.

Ultralight,3bvkfi,iamda5h,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:35:19 2015 UTC,"I picked up a new Hubba Hubba (NX, the red one) in May and have since spent 11 nights in it. I do not use a footprint, am pretty hard on my gear, and I recently spent 7 days in rocky Canadian shield country with barely enough moss on the rocks to put the stakes in.  Not so much as a scuff on the fabric yet, and it has held up to inches of rain and intense straight lying winds.  As long as you choose your tent area somewhat carefully, I would have no reservations about running the Hubba Hubba with no footprint/groundcloth.  For the old version (green in color I think), 200 with no poles is not a good deal. For the NX it is approaching a better deal, but finding replacement poles could be tough and set you back $100.   I'm a huge fan of the Hubba Hubba already. Takes seconds to set up, and it is easy enough to set up by yourself.   I would see if you can source a new set of poles before committing to buying it. I got my NX brand new for $300 (USD) so if finding poles is challenging or expensive you might be better off buying new."

Ultralight,3bqgdj,THE_BOKEH_BLOKE,3,Wed Jul 1 19:45:49 2015 UTC,"Good advice here already, but certainly try a hammock for multiple nights before investing too much.    It is not automatically comfortable for everyone."
Ultralight,3bqgdj,ViagraAndSweatpants,2,Thu Jul 2 02:42:53 2015 UTC,"A standard sleeping pad/sleeping bag will work instead of an underquilt/quilt. So, the only weight difference will come from the shelter. The hyperlight hennesy hammock weighs 1.5 pounds, so within a pound of the zpacks shelter (which will require additional stakes.) Especially if money is not an issue, I would swap out the skimpy sil-nylon fly on the hyperlight for a more generous cuben fiber one. More rain protection, less weight.  Make the final decision on which one will give you a better sleep at night, not the difference in ounces."
Ultralight,3bqgdj,Thexorretor,2,Wed Jul 1 10:40:18 2015 UTC,The Hennessy ultralight is not ultralight. It's suspension system also is one of the worse options for hammocks in my opinion. Look for a cottage hammock you can suspend with Dutchware straps or whoopie slings.
Ultralight,3bqgdj,7629,2,Wed Jul 1 14:21:05 2015 UTC,"You're going to want to skip Hennessy stuff, it's heavy and has crappy features (skimpy tarp, fiddly suspension, etc). Fact is, sleeping on the ground is always going to be lighter, but not that much so. You are comparing a high end zpacks shelter to a bottom tier hammock. Look into better cottage manufacturers. The best place to learn about hammocks is on http://hammockforums.com  I haven't tried it, but the Half-Wit hammock from dutchware looks promising if you're looking for something ultra light weight that has a bug net. I am going to try it this winter (in Florida). Otherwise, I'd recommend something from Warbonnet or Dream Hammocks. Whatever you pick, don't shortchange yourself on the length, if you're near 6', get an 11' hammock, it's much easier to get a comfortable lay. Get your suspension from Dutchware. Pick a tarp you can afford, cuben if you can. Warbonnet, Hammock Gear, ZPacks, etc all make good tarps. Don't get a full length underquilt, they are nice but you can easily get away with a half length like the Warbonnet Yeti, or something a little longer like the Hammock Gear Pheonix. Get your topquilt from a place like Hammock Gear or Enlightened Equipment or Underground Quilts. If you are going to get a 20F quilt, skip the snaps and just get it sewn, you'll probably never use it unsnapped. Something like this would get you to about 4.75lbs. Easily worth the small premium to hang in a hammock every night, no question."
Ultralight,3bqgdj,mvmntsofthemind,2,Wed Jul 1 14:44:05 2015 UTC,"As a man with a Hennessy, skip it. You're only going to want to upgrade and then you'll be out the cost of your Hennessy.

Synthetics are a little more reliable when wet, but aren't worth the extra weight & volume, especially now that treated down is available.  A normal down bag ould be used in conjunction with a dry bag. You will just have to make sure you baby it. If it gets wet it won't work well.  A quilt, versus a mummy bag, will increase breathability and decrease weight at the expense of some comfort and protection from the elements.

I did this last year and we aimed for being at the top for sunrise (4 am ish) which is worth it IMO. In this case you will need a headlamp. You may want one anyway just in case something weird happens.   Also, bring money (coins) for bathrooms and you may want to get your hiking stick stamped.  I started without long underwear but by station 8 I needed it. Even at the end of July it was in the low 30's and sometimes the mountain can get very crowded and you aren't moving very fast at all. And it can be very windy. The only time I was cold was at the top because we had to wait 3 hours for a slower moving person in my group. But at the top there is food and beer so it wasn't that bad. Have money for a bowl of hot soup at the top.  Also, just to warn you, I thought the walk down was way worse then the walk up. It's super dusty and all loose gravel. Seemingly endless switchbacks and not very interesting scenery. I sort of question shoes instead of boots to keep the stones out of your shoes.  Here is a an example of how crowded it can get. I took this pic when I was almost near the top."

Ultralight,3bllsb,veronique_m,0,Tue Jun 30 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"I hiked JDF a couple of years ago!   I found that I didn't need a sleeping pad - your tent is pitched either on the beach where the sand is soft, or on the relatively soft forest floor (depending on which sites you use - I did it in 4 nights). You probably know this but definitely don't cut the gaiters, and make sure they're well buckled along the bottom - I would have lost a boot if they hadn't been, after sinking into knee-high mud! Bear spray isn't necessary (nor is a bear bell in my opinion, but if you feel you need that for comfort then fine. I'm pretty sure not a single person I encountered had one though). I don't know how familiar you are with black bears (are you from the Island?), but they aren't aggressive. We did encounter a mama bear and cub while we were on the trail (rounded the corner and there she was - the baby was up in a tree). She was mostly preoccupied with getting away from us as quickly as possible. Bear spray is quite heavy, and the scenario in which you might benefit from using it is one in a million (i.e. it's as likely to be useful on JDF as a space blanket is) Do you need a battery pack? Is it for your phone? You're not going to be getting signal out there anyway, just turn it off. What's the knife for? I can't think of a use unless it's for food prep, but you shouldn't need that with your pre-prepared meals. This isn't deep wilderness we're talking about - there are even outhouses everywhere along the trail. I would never bring a frisbee, but that's just me   You'll encounter lots of people on the trail - especially Sombrio Beach which has road access and lots of day trippers. If there's anything general you want to scrap (mainly that knife!) I'm positive you could mooch things."
Ultralight,3bllsb,veronique_m,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:34:32 2015 UTC,"That's why I mentioned it - it's ostensibly the worst case scenario, but really the bears just want to run away from you. In this case, the mom was a little agitated because she wanted to scamper away, but had to wait until the baby climbed down the tree first - they were communicating to each other and kept looking over at us, but I never even once felt in danger. As soon as we could get by without looking like we were walking toward them, we kept on walking past to leave them in peace. I can't imagine using bear spray - it would only have severely escalated an otherwise peaceful scenario. Maybe a bear bell would have avoided the situation entirely, but I was with a group of 4 people and we were chatting away - mama bear was just too busy chomping on berries to notice us until we were 15 ft away.  I grew up in British Columbia and have encountered too many bears to count - brown and black bears are indeed super docile. We used to get them in my backyard because it backed onto a forest, and they would just walk through as I was sitting out in the yard, and just keep going even when my dog would try and sniff after them. Grizzlies are apparently another story (I've never met one), but they're not going to be on the west coast of Vancouver Island."

It is a lot of criss-crossing straps and can be unflattering in sweat spots, chaffing from clothes moving. The front pockets do work as feeding pouches. Mine are a lot smaller than 12L at 3L though. I keep a bottle and water purification stuff on one side, snacks go on the other. At about a 1.5L pouch, I can fit like 1500 calories worth of food in there.   So at 12L, I could see myself being able to carry a weeks worth of stuff. It may be a bit weird where my cook kit ends up in the front... along with my quilt? I'm not sure how I would position things, but it would probably work."

These packs are our bread and butter, I can't compare them to the ULA packs but I think the comfort is pretty awesome compared to other packs I have worn.   They are on the heavy side though. The mountain magic is tempting for the weight but it lacks a real hipbelt which limits it's load carrying drastically.  If you can deal with the weigh, the featherlite freedom is pretty awesome.   Make sure you don't get an old one though. The lime green is the current model and the older ones had some issues.   I'm happy to answer any questions you have :)"

Id say the MM could carry upto 12-13kg, but i think above 10kg the FF is going to be the better choice. The MM doesnt have a full length stay or a real hipbelt so when you increase the load above 10 ish you will start to feel the weight on the shoulders more."

Ultralight,3b8whd,Minsc-and-Boo,3,Fri Jun 26 22:42:29 2015 UTC,"The thing about glacier is that the trails/terrain can be incredibly diverse. Everything from sinking sand/mud where boots are necessary to paved trails better met with sneakers.  For the most part even the trails by the campsites tend to have exposed roots/rocks on them, and some of the trails by Lake McDonald can get very hilly (and these are considered the easy/moderate trails).  I know that people who wear the trail gloves and other ""barefoot"" style shoes are very partial to them. Considering how light they are, bring them with you, but I would probably suggest something with better sole protection in case you decide to go wading in the thick grass or go pretty much anywhere off the beaten path.  No matter what though you're going to have a trip of a lifetime. Glacier was one of the highlights when I lived in Montana and I hope I can make it back there again sooner rather than later."

Ultralight,3b8whd,noworriespete,2,Sat Jun 27 02:30:09 2015 UTC,"Glacier is amazing. I've been twice and want to go again.    Random advise: Make sure you look up their requirements on bear canisters, they are specific and rigid. Some of the trail heads have 40 miles of gravel roads, make sure your tires aren't bald (a sharp rock punctured my tire and we lost more than 12 hours trying to fix that)"
Ultralight,3b8whd,FlammablePie,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:23:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for the advice. Bear spray is on my list to get. As far as the tires go we will be renting a car so usually fairly low mileage vehicles/tires but thanks for the heads up.
Ultralight,3b8whd,blankedinmyblank,2,Sun Jun 28 01:56:22 2015 UTC,A lot of places in Glacier rent bear spray to hikers. That might be a cheaper option to look into if you haven't already.
Ultralight,3b8whd,weatherwar,2,Sun Jun 28 10:43:08 2015 UTC,"Trail runners for sure. You can get tons that are both lightweight and very protective.  The Saucony Peregrine's are the highest rated trail runners available, as tested by Outdoor Gear Lab (trustworthy source). I have owned three pairs.  Another set that I like alot is the Inov-8 Trailroc 245's. They're even lighter, albeit less durable. Also have a rockplate while being very light.  So those are two of my favorites, but I would 100% suggest trail runners. They can do everything, and are basically hiking shoes but better. The alternative would be full hiking boots, but those aren't used very often anymore. They're too clunky, and you won't need that level of protection unless you're planning to carry more than 30lbs, and/or will be in pretty bad conditions (like knee height snow or very very heavy rains). For normal wetness, these trail runners will dry up and shed water within 10 minutes."

Ultralight,3b30wg,tangbang,6,Thu Jun 25 15:42:27 2015 UTC,"For dessert camping, the problem with a bug bivy is that sand(more like grit particles) gets blown into your face through the mesh if there is wind(which inevitably migrates to your ass via some gravitational pull). So you'll probably also carry a tarp to also block the sun and wind.  It can also get pretty muggy inside of a bivy when it is hot. Sleeping almost naked always feels weird to me because of how the bivy clings to my skin. In colder wetter environments, there is the condensation problem.   I do own a couple bivy/bivy tents and do love them though. There are just tradeoffs to be aware of."
Ultralight,3b30wg,dummey,2,Thu Jun 25 15:54:31 2015 UTC,"I usually camp with a hammock, so I typically would carry a tarp anyways. I'm sure i could rig it up somehow with hiking poles to stand over the bivy sack.  What would you recommend for desert camping if not a bivy bag? Or alternatively, what features should I be looking for in a bivy bag that would do well in the desert?"
Ultralight,3b30wg,dummey,3,Thu Jun 25 16:12:32 2015 UTC,"My current go-to for desert (well at least it would be my go to if I was still living close to deserts) would be the Protrail from Tarptent. Pitch the leading 2 edges low to help keep the sand and grit out. Bring extra stakes for the midpoints. And if it is really bad, I will use my stones, my pack, etc to weigh down the edges. I have only done this up to about 40ish mph winds, so some conditions would destroy my setup.  But let's say you don't want something so heavy. The bivy is perfectly fine combined with a low pitched tarp. Something like a half pyramid style pitch will protect you plenty from most conditions. Keep a towel/rag with you to do a quick wipe down if condensation collects on the inside. And open up the bivy to throw on some more layers at night. Bivys work for a lot of people and could work for you."
Ultralight,3b30wg,alienhacker,3,Thu Jun 25 16:34:19 2015 UTC,"If you order one, I would buy the the Long/Wide version to have a little extra room. And be careful when you open the USPS box. It gets delivered in a small USPS box so don't open it with a knife."

Ultralight,3az86i,CesarV,2,Wed Jun 24 18:09:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you again for your contribution, this time as this very interesting blog post.  I've been researching and brain storming about making my first myog shelter for a while now and this post is definitely another interesting information. As of now I'm considering either doing something similar to your Zpacks Cuben Flat Tarp plus MLD Silnylon Serenity Combo or even your Six Moon Designs Skyscape X Hybrid Tent since I like the idea of using my hiking hiking poles.  How do you think do these two options compare weather-resistance wise? I don't have a Golite poncho tarp, so I would maybe have to use a little bigger flat tarp.  If you want to I would be really interested in your ideas, what do you think would be a great feature to have in a myog shelter? Thanks!"
Ultralight,3az86i,mgn5,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:04:35 2015 UTC,"Glad you liked it, and thanks to you again for your kind words.  Generally I like modular shelters more than tents, and love a good flat tarp.  So if I had to pick only one of my shelters, it would be my Zpacks tarp and MLD Serenity.  That being said, my Skyscape X has also been a remarkable shelter.  I've used it in the rain a fair amount of times, a few times quite heavy rain, and it's always kept me dry as far as weather resistance goes.  There was even one time recently there was moderate to heavy rain all evening, night and early morning on a trip, and I thought that this would be the time that rain spray or leaking might happen.  It didn't, I was dry and warm all through the evening/night/early morning inside the tent.  But I've been through more rainy/snowy days/nights under flat tarps of various kinds, and heavier rain/snow too, and I think because of all my experience with flat tarps I've never had one fail completely on me.  Size is important too.  I've used smaller tarps and had some rain/snow make its way inside a bit, but never with tarps that were properly sized for my body.  As I note on my blog, I find a 6ft X 9ft tarp to be just about the perfect size for me.  So if I were to do a MYOG shelter, here is what I would try and build:  A 6 X 9 tarp out of either high quality silnylon or .75 or 1.0 Cuben.  A silnylon floor inner net tent with the same length and width of the MLD Serenity solo, but with a bit more head room, and with solid fabric walls after the bathtub silnylon floor (around 25cm or so) to block wind more effectively, and the same solid silnylon ends as the Serenity.  There are no UL net tents that I am aware of that have solid walls in addition to noseeum fine netting.  And ones that do custom work either charge a lot of money for it, or have issues with long waits for gear in general (and extra long for custom stuff).  As a hiking pole user you can choose to use your poles with this shelter system, nor not if you find the right spot (which is what I do).  A nice poncho/tarp is good to have for both rain gear/pack cover, and also to use as a front door.  Highly recommend them!  Get a Sea to Summit or MLD, I've read good reviews on both.  I'm pretty sure that MLD's poncho/tarps are larger than the Golite.  Anyhow, hope this helps.  Make sure to show us all pics of your finished MYOG shelter, whatever you choose to make!"

Ultralight,3az86i,mgn5,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:05:19 2015 UTC,"No problemo!  What I should have added BTW, is that there are some breathable nylons out there (perhaps you already know this) that are just as heavy or lighter than netting fabric.  For example, Argon 67 fabric.  I am a big fan of that fabric.  I used it for a MYOG summer sleeping bag and really like the way it feels and of course the weight is great.  However it is tricky to sew with if you're not familiar with UL fabrics."
Ultralight,3az86i,mgn5,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:36:15 2015 UTC,"Argon 67   Do you know of an European supplier for that fabric? And can it really be strong enough at that weight?  The only thing that I could find that was close to that fabric is Ripstop-Nylon, downproof, ultralight, 7den, 22g/sqm, it's about 7grams heavier per square meter, but from what I understand in a way similar. It's similar in weight to an ultralight mosquito net.   For the tarp I would probably take either Cuben fiber laminate, 25g/qm, altough I'm worried a bit about abrasion, or probably Ripstop Nylon tentfabric silicone coated, 20den, 36g/sqm, since it's 2,5x cheaper and only 11 grams heavier per square meter. Which would mean 53 grams more, which is ok I guess.   For the floor I would probably use Groundsheet, Nylon, PU-coated, 90 g/sqm, it's a bit lighter than the heavier version.   Very excited to get started!"

It's pretty thin but seems to be holding up just fine on my sleeping bag, and I know that there are thru-hikers that have made MYOG sleeping bags out of it (Joe Brewer comes to mind, check out his video here ) and made it the whole thru-hike with the bag seeming to be just fine.

I like the look for casual use.  They would likely prove to be too warm for high output activities in the middle of summer; the fabric isn't super thick but it's not exactly thin, either (my pair is a size 34 and weighs 365g).  The fabric is a wool/cotton blend and the weave is fairly tight, so it will retain moisture more than pure wool or a wool/nylon blend.  Could I hike in them?  Sure, but I doubt that they would be my first choice if I'm expecting temps >85F."

If you are looking for a pair of light cargos for hot summer hiking, not exactly cheap but the closest to my ideal are the arc'teryx rampart shorts.  I actually wear the rampart pants on most of my summer backpacking trips and just roll them up into shorts as needed - the fabric is quite thin but highly durable/breathable, while also maintaining a degree of water and wind resistance due to the tight weave of the fabric."

Sometimes you can find them at the REI outlet as well (check their website).  It slept me (5'4, 130), my friend (5'5, 150) who forgot her hammock bug net, and my Kestrel 48 pack with room to spare.  If it's just me, I don't bother staking it - but if you want the extra room, you'll need to stake it out.  Ultra light weight, dries quickly, lots of mesh, held up nicely in wind and rain.  I haven't had it in temps lower than 65 yet (I'm in Texas).  If you can find it on sale or pony up the extra $50, I think it would perfectly suit your needs.  You can also look around Craiglist and Steep and Cheap to find some awesome deals within your price range."

Weight-saving might be worth ditching the free-standing ideal.  If I had to do it again I'd go Tarptent, the contrail or whatever it is now. Super light, in your budget, stupid easy setup. They've got optional tentpoles if you don't use hiking poles."

Ultralight,3b17wq,despalicious,2,Sat Jun 27 06:45:02 2015 UTC,"Arrgh, mobile.  It's on sale for $299 vs $499 for the latest model which merely adds gimmicky LED lights for a 2oz penalty. Double side doors, high rain tub, and tons of mesh for good (IMO great) airflow. Free standing with simple two-piece pole design: >-|--<. Plenty of interior and vestibule room, and much more usable than the 1-door UL1 I also have that makes me keep the gear outside to bring the dog in and also forces tough placement choices for best ingress/egress at less than perfect sites on slopes or with obstacles nearby (as all single door tents will do, especially front-loaders - keep that in mind)."
Ultralight,3b17wq,despalicious,-1,Sat Jun 27 06:53:13 2015 UTC,"$300 is a TIGHT budget for a backpacking tent. If you're going to get stakes, a groundsheet, swam sealer, that's another $50 on top of whatever tent you purchase. I also had a $300 budget and I settled on the Tarptent Protrail. It's 26 ounces and CAN be set up with hiking poles, but it can also be purchased with tent poles that only weigh 5 ounces. It's a bit fragile and it probably won't stop extreme weather (heavy snow, below 0 degrees, torrential downpours, hurricane winds), but for a cheap, ultralight tent, it's hard to beat. I've seen reviews that prove it to be a roomy 1 person tent which could hold 2 people in a pinch. It's also SUPER easy to set up. You can buy a Tyvec groundsheet from them. I think for a completely ready to camp tent package, I paid $250. I have yet to test the tent on a campout with adverse weather, but with a couple nights of staying outside  in the Tennessee summer heat, I can say that this is a very breezy, open tent. Definitely consider it."
Ultralight,3b17wq,Dracoflame14,-1,Thu Jun 25 15:47:50 2015 UTC,I have the Big Agnus Seedhouse 1 which mostly meets your criteria. I can put it up in less than 5 minutes and it has a small vestibule. Perhaps a bit too small depending on the size of your pack. Inside there is lots of room. Amazing amount of room actually. It is narrow at the feet but quite wide at the shoulders so it feels big. Great in all weather too.

Ultralight,3b17wq,generationfourth,-1,Fri Jun 26 16:12:09 2015 UTC,I'm in love with Sierra Designs right now. they are doing innovative things with their tent designs. I like their Flashlight FL 1.   I love how they use an awning instead of a vestibule. You'll still be able to keep the 'windows down' during rain. The fly and tent body are one piece so setup should be stupid easy.
Ultralight,3azmab,troyKc,19,Wed Jun 24 19:55:13 2015 UTC,"You only need one shirt. And if you can acquire a pair of zipoff pants, you can eliminate your trousers and trackshorts. You probably only need one pair of pants anyway. Since from the thermal gear I'm assuming you're going someplace pretty cold, I'd say bring one pair of long pants and plan on rolling them up if they get too hot. If your thermal gear is heavy, invest in some merino wool stuff, it's really warm but also light. If it's still not enough warmth wise then just bring more layers- it'll still be lighter than one thick jacket/vest/pair of gloves and several thin layers gives you more warmth and versatility overall.   Sunglasses might not be necessary- will you be in the desert? Otherwise they're probably an unnecessary luxury. Packing light is about what you need, not what you want. How thick's your book? If it's for reading, consider getting a cheap kindle (charge lasts a month), if it's for writing get a pocketsized moleskin style. You probably don't need more than 2 pens. Cheap ones will be lighter.   Why the calculator/ruler? You've got a phone. If you really need to measure something, mark it out with sharpie on your rope beforehand.   You don't need two flashlights. Especially if there's one on your phone. Bring the smaller one and maybe 1 set of spare batteries. You don't need a spare cell phone. If you're worried about failure, invest in better primary items. When you're carrying everything on your back redundancy is not usually worth it. You also only need one charger, if you really need the phone in the first place.   Consider sticking to one method of firestarting. I like to bring flint/steel, matches, and a bic just in case shit's wet or something, but if you're worried about weight and you won't be out long enough to run out of fluid, I'd say get a bic and call it a day.   You don't need two knives. Pick the one that's lighter, probably, unless you're actually going to use the extra features of the big one.   50 ft of paracord will be more than enough. I promise.  You don't need the bungee or the clip, unless it's for something specific. You've got a knife, so lose the scissors.   You don't need that much lighter fluid. If you're going to be out for long enough to need that much, you'll need to resupply food sooner, so you can get more fluid then. If you're good at starting fires the old fashioned way, don't bring it at all.   Unless you're going to another country (in which case leave the knives and firestarting gear at home), you don't need the passport. ID is enough. USB is not needed. Pliers not needed.  Deodorant is not needed. You will be outdoors. You will smell bad, deo or no. If you absolutely must have it, why 3 cans? Get a single travel sized.   500ml is a shit ton of antiseptic. Get a tiny bottle, maybe 20-30ml. Or, wait, you've got cream. Just use that. Or wait, better still, don't get antiseptic. Get a small bottle of GermX, use that for everyday sanitation. If you get cut, use it as antiseptic- it'll hurt like hell but it does the job.   If you're cut bad enough to need 2 boxes of dressings, plasters, plus the cream and spray plaster, you're fucked anyway. Bring a half dozen bandaids of various sizes, keep the tape, drop the nail clippers (again, you have a fucking knife), call it a day.   1L of water is a good amount. Consider getting your meats/proteins in plastic packaging rather than tins. Look for stuff that is not packaged with water, the more dehydrated the better- that's assuming you have access to water on the trail. You probably don't need 50 tablets, although the weight there is probably negligible. Don't bring the spare flint and wick- just get new ones to bring, make sure they work.   Other than that, your ""big 3"" of pack, sleeping bag, and tent can most likely get smaller if you spend money on upgrades. But I bet you can cut your load by more than half if you follow my suggestions. Hope it helps, happy hiking!"

Ultralight,3azmab,ProudCatLady,3,Wed Jun 24 20:30:23 2015 UTC,"OK, taking you seriously. This is typically a place where people discuss recreational outdoor adventure hiking and camping. We focus on taking as little as possible and choosing very lightweight equipment. I don't know how much that will help you, but I'll respond as I would with anyone else asking for this kind of advice.  There are two ways to reduce the weight of your pack, carrying lighter items and carrying fewer items. Before you really begin to reduce weight, you need to understand what's really making your pack so heavy. To do that, you'll need to weigh all your gear and then decide what you can leave at home and what you can replace with lighter options.  Here are suggestions for both from your list:  1 sleeping bag - How much does it weigh? 1kg/2LB is about the upper end of what you likely need 2 shirts - why 2? take one instead 2 trousers - why 2? take 1 1 pair of tracksuit shorts - why shorts and trousers? just take one or the other depending on weather 2 pairs of socks - that's fine 2 pairs of underwear - also fine 1 balaclava/scarf thing - reasonable 1 pair of thermal gloves - reasonable 1 thermal vest - how much does this weigh? for 3-season use your insulating layer can be less than 1lb/500g 1 pair of thermal leggings - fine 1 beanie hat - do you need this and a balaclava 1 waterproof coat - again, how much does this weigh. I use a 7oz/200g poncho most of the time and a 12oz/340g coat when needed 1 small towel - weight? aim for less than 2oz/50g, consider a bandana 1 pair of sunglasses - fine 1 book - fine various pens - why do you need more than one? 1 calculator - what is this for? remove 1 ruler - useless 1 large torch - take just one, and make it small 1 small torch - how small, a cheap headlamp at 3oz/75g is plenty various batteries - for what? If you're going on a longer trip, take one spare for each battery you're using, that's it 1 smartphone - fine 1 spare cell phone - I'm trusting you're not joking here, please leave this at home 2 mobile phone chargers - useless, leave these at home 1 flint and steal - fine 1 box of safety matches - fine 1 swiss army knife - fine 1 spare small spare knife - why? remove this 85 feet of paracord - why? remove 1 bungee cord with clips useless, remove 1 spare clip useless, remove 1 pair of scissors you already have a knife, remove 1 and a half bottles of lighter fluid what is this for? remove 1 passport fine 1 ID card - fine 1 USB stick - useless, remove 1 pair of pliers - not necessary, remove 3 small cans of deodorant - remove 1 500ml bottle of anti septic take 10ml instead 2 boxes of assorted wound dressings eliminate, get yourself to medical help instead 1 roll of micro-porous tape - remove 1 set of nail clippers - remove 1 small tube of anti-septic cream - keep it very small 1 set of spray on anti-septic plaster - remove 1 liter of water - fine 3 tins of meat and fish - fine 1 packet of beef jerky - fine 1 packet of wasabi nuts- fine 1 box of breakfast crackers- fine 50 water purification tablets - why 50? 1 spare flint and lighter wick - remove"

Ultralight,3b0f81,evanthepineapple,11,Wed Jun 24 23:35:34 2015 UTC,As a Japanese-American hiker the pretentious Japanese mysticism Nihonjinron mumbo jumbo in this article makes me want to retch.    Also the rhetorical structure of the article reads exactly like so much writing I've read in Japanese intended for a Japanese audience but I think it conveys a very weird attitude in English (not to mention the fact that the indirect structure that seems so reasonable to my Japanese brain seems pointlessly roundabout to my American brain).

I guess my feeling though is more about all this really expensive gear which is in my belief cool but as someone who grew up in the outdoors much of my own gear was modified personally. This is something I have always had an affinity for particularly in my dealings with the outdoors. Even now I design my own hard backpacks for carrying camera equipment.

If you want an integrated bug net hammock, the top of the line is considered to be the Warbonnet Blackbird. Hennessy is mostly just convenient because it's kind of an all in one, which eliminates a lot of the confusion for noobs.   I assembled my own system out of mostly DIY parts. My tarp, bug protection, and hammock suspension were all homemade by me, and it's considerably lighter than anything commercially available.

Ultralight,3au1nz,flaneurJacques,2,Tue Jun 23 15:08:40 2015 UTC,"Rating vs. Comfort level is completely different. I'd never take a 40 degree bag into the sierra. Even during the summer. 30 would be pushing it, and usually I take my 15. I'm a warm sleeper also."
Ultralight,3au1nz,Jsf42,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:33:01 2015 UTC,My style is to wear a lot of clothing when I sleep to get away with a lighter bag. I wore a jacket and my rain pants in my 30 degree bag in the Sierra in June and was more than comfortable.
Ultralight,3au1nz,Wonkbro,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:47:12 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response. I have a quilt that is rated 20 degrees. Haha so it is way warmer than the intended temperature.   Hmmm. I am an early riser and that is when I like to go out and about taking pictures. Maybe if I keep moving I won't get too cold? Or maybe my buff is also enough to add some warmth.
Ultralight,3au1nz,GoNorthYoungMan,2,Tue Jun 23 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"I mean with that quilt you won't be in any danger. If you can get up and moving, maybe a warm beverage, the worst I imagine the morning being is slightly uncomfortable."

Ultralight,3arvs8,cwcoleman,3,Tue Jul 14 06:27:49 2015 UTC,Have you considered Hyperlite Mountain Gear? They have some very durable/light packs that sound like you (although I don't actually own one). https://www.hyperlitemountaingear.com/
Ultralight,3arvs8,cwcoleman,2,Tue Jun 23 03:11:41 2015 UTC,"I've been looking at the 3400 Windrider. Compared to the Haul it's 8oz heavier, 5L smaller & slightly more expensive with less bells & whistles. It does seem to be designed for the way I'm expecting to (ab)use the pack whereas I worry about breaking the carbon fiber frame of the zpacks haul..."
Ultralight,3arvs8,TheLibertyTree,2,Tue Jun 23 03:45:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm curious on the comparison of the 2 materials. 50D Cuben/Polyester Hybrid for the HMG and 4.8 oz/sqyd Dyneema Ripstop for the ZPacks. I think with either you should be prepared to do field repairs (cuben tape is easy to pack in a repair kit).          The size is slightly misleading. HMG quotes their internal size only (55L), while ZPacks includes the pockets in their quote (60L). With external space the HMG pack is 65L (47L to 55L internal comparison). Weight (8oz heavier) and cost ($15) are both things to consider.            Really not trying to convince you one way or the other (especially since I own neither). They both look quality."
Ultralight,3arvs8,AmorphousForm,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:02:08 2015 UTC,You make a good point about the size. And the cost/weight are close enough for the most critical piece of gear.  Does anyone have reason to prefer either material?
Ultralight,3arvs8,Thexorretor,2,Tue Jun 23 04:23:08 2015 UTC,"I have packs in both materials. The HMG hybrid fabric is slightly stronger/thicker/heavier than the Zpacks version. I'm not sure how to best quantify it, but the difference is noticeable but fairly slight between the two. The HMG packs are also reinforced on the bottom with a little extra fabric to resist abrasion.   I wouldn't drag either over rock and expect them hold up very long. If you have plans to ""abuse"" your gear, I'd stay away from anything this delicate. If you just expect a little more contact with granite, I'd go with the HMG."
Ultralight,3arvs8,kybishop,3,Wed Jun 24 19:44:25 2015 UTC,I'd buy two packs. If you were carrying 9kg rope on top it would be worth having a super comfy 2+ kg pack imho.

Ultralight,3arvs8,Afin12,3,Tue Jun 23 18:13:56 2015 UTC,Check out the Patagonia ascentionist series. It has a pretty good carrying capacity. It was designed with Steve House for a minimalist alpine pack. Hyperlite gear makes more climber focused packs as the main guy is a ice climber.
Ultralight,3arvs8,vikingengineer,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"I hadn't seen these before, looking into them now. Thanks for sharing"
Ultralight,3arvs8,Afin12,2,Tue Jun 23 01:16:50 2015 UTC,"I heavily recommend against the Patagonia Ascentionist series for hiking; there are no external pockets, nor even a port for a water bladder. Yeah you can use the brain on top . . but it is quite unideal for needing to grab anything quickly. These babies are certainly sick for alpine and multi-pitch climbing, but really are extremely specific to that need.  In my experience, you don't want to have to stop and take your pack off every time you want to grab your water."
Ultralight,3arvs8,xTragx,3,Tue Jun 23 04:27:01 2015 UTC,"If durability is one of your priorities, you probably want to avoid cuben fiber packs. It's a really strong material and will work great for a while, but every long-term user I've spoken to says that it tends to break down from abrasion way quicker than nylon or nylon-like materials (somebody please correct me if this is outdated information), which isn't an issue for tarps or tents but is unavoidable for a backpack."
Ultralight,3arvs8,jtridevil,2,Tue Jun 23 06:45:27 2015 UTC,"Cuben fiber packs used to have this issue. As manufacturers came to understand the material better, they started using different material blends (cuben fiber/polymer blends) as well as slightly more thickness, such as 2.5ozs/sq yard as opposed to 1.5ozs/sq yard weight material. Good cuben fiber packs are held together through sewing/taping/sealant now. Earlier models used to separate at the seams, especially at the shoulders when put under stress.  From a statistical point of view, CF packs from cottage industries are holding up better now that initial models have been put into production. The manufacturer has a greater sample size from which to gather failures analysis. From this they can make minor design tweaks so that their product is more rugged. Gossamer Gear is on like its 4th iteration of the Mariposa and it continues to evolve.     EDIT: I would argue that a pack should last through one thru hike of a given triple crown trail. If it goes beyond that, great, but designing a pack that is going to last over 6,000 miles or something ridiculous means to me that it is overengineered and probably heavier than I would like it to be. But that is just my two cents."
Ultralight,3arvs8,rext12,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:31:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information, I didn't know the fabric itself had changed that much. I agree that anything which can last a whole thru-hike should be considered reasonably durable, so if cuben fiber packs can consistently do that now I guess I have to withdraw that complaint."
Ultralight,3arvs8,TheLibertyTree,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:11:44 2015 UTC,"Cuben fiber is interesting from a materials science point of view. Its strength and resiliance increases exponentially when its thickness is increased, and its properties are ideal for tents and packs from what I have researched.   Will ""Redbeard"" Wood gives a great review of the Zpacks Arc Blast 52L after a thru hike of the AT. He says somewhere in a different video prior to his current PCT thru hike that Zpacks has made improvements to the packs and are continuing to re-engineer their designs.  I will say that while cuben fiber is good for packs or tents, it isn't as good for rain jackets - the rubbing of shoulder straps on the shoulders of the jacket will wear through the material."
Ultralight,3arvs8,TheLibertyTree,3,Thu Jul 9 02:17:58 2015 UTC,"Finding a pack that does both might be difficult. A 20 lbs rope is about  the same weight as my 4 day full load out including food and water.  Maybe buy a pack for hiking  and a pack for climbing?  Anyway I would recommend the ÜLA CDT (trim some useless stuff) as a cheap, very durable hiking pack. But I am not sure if it comfortably carries  a multi-day load including a 20lbs rope.  Stay away from cuben packs. Cuben is great for tarps, but to fragile for packs."

I've bought a nice down quilt (that I plan to use as an under/overquilt with my hammock), a set of Ti pots (that I've received a few days ago), some lightweight Y stakes, drybags, and other minor stuff/  I only had an issue with a rain poncho (was supposed to be silnylon at about 200+ grams, and it was actually PU coated nylon, at about 240 grams). I've used the 'dispute' button, and I've got my money back (I preferred to keep the product in the end, and pay just a small amount of money, and the seller agreed - so all was fine).  I did not expect the same quality as the more expensive brands, but I was actually (nicely) surprised by the quality of the products, so.. I will probably buy again (at least smaller, cheaper things).  For lighter tents (and not only), I've found this store http://www.aliexpress.com/store/1302938 . I was actually looking at the same tent from your first link; it looks interesting, but I am not so convinced about the height at the feet end - but it can probably be fixed with a stick or something to raise it a little if necessary."

Ultralight,3aqkkp,leparanoid,2,Tue Jun 23 17:04:34 2015 UTC,"I just weighted it now, and quilt + stuff sack was exactly 540g (40g the stuffsack) . It also comes with a larger storage bag (and yes, it's a pain in the arse to fit it in the stuff sack).   about warmth, I didn't test it on the field yet (surgery, can't move too fast for the next 6..7 weeks), but at home with open windows and 13..15C outside I was warm in just a t-shirt (a bit too warm, actually, but I have no idea what temp was inside) .   As a small review:   weight matches specs included storage bag minuscule stuff sack; I don't use it anyway zipper goes all the way around, and it opens completely (you get a blanket) (could be better quality, but it does the job) stitching is good, even, no loose ends the baffles are sewn through (but no surprise here) the materials are a bit plasticky somehow , shinier on the outside and more matte on the inside. They don't feel bad, but I am not sure how breathable  and durable they are. fill quantity and quality seem true (compared to a 300g 750fp sleeping bag); it lofts up quite nicely, and I expect the temperature ratings to be ok it's shorter, they mention that in the description (183cm). I'm 178cm high, so I have to sleep a bit on the diagonal if I want to stretch and be fully covered.  it was a bit smelly when I got it, but was ok after airing it for a couple oh hours.    You'll have to weight for yourself the +es and - es, but for the price and overall impression, I am very happy with it. I can't wait to give it a try in the field.

Ultralight,3arvo2,stoned_geologist,14,Tue Jun 23 00:32:18 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't risk it.  At temperatures that low, you're looking at possible hypothermia and/or frostbite if you miscalculate even a little bit.  Sleeping out in 0 degrees F isn't something to take lightly.  Something to keep in mind is that many with many bags/quilts, the given rating is the survival rating, not the comfort rating, and it's often best to assume that the comfort rating is at least 10 degrees higher than the survival rating- meaning that a 30 degree quilt may start to feel uncomfortable below 40 degrees.  Also, while you can get more mileage out of a sleeping bag in colder weather with more layers of clothing, it's also worth remembering that adding layers of clothing is much less efficient than adding insulation to your sleeping bag.  With less clothing, warmth from your core will travel to your extremities not only through blood flow, but through direct radiation, conduction, and air convection within your bag/quilt.  Adding clothing insulates your extremities from your body, meaning that heat will only travel through blood flow, which is less efficient.  Also, in colder temperatures, you need to start thinking about moisture management, particularly for longer trips (3+ nights).  In cold temps, moisture from your body tends to build up and freeze in the insulation of sleeping bags.  This can have a significant negative impact on the bags ability to keep you warm.    I own a sleeping bag rated to 35 degrees.  I carry a liner with me that will lower the temperature rating by 10 degrees.  I've used the setup on 25 degree nights in the past, which worked, but it wasn't the most fun I've ever had camping out.    If you're serious about sleeping out in cold weather, then you should be serious about getting a proper cold weather sleeping system."
Ultralight,3arvo2,DSettahr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:14:30 2015 UTC,"I am trying to do this on a budget.  I currently own a MountainSmith Poncha 35 degree sleeping bag.  If I used both, do you think I would be better off?  The bag is about 3lbs but it would save me some money."
Ultralight,3arvo2,DSettahr,3,Wed Jun 24 22:50:38 2015 UTC,"Doubling up on sleep systems will help, but not as much as you might wish... unless one is significantly larger than the other, the insulation of the inner system ends getting compressed more and losing efficiency.  If you used the quilt as the outer layer it might not be so bad, but it is still less than the ideal of having a sleeping system that designed for the temperatures you're out in.  I hate to break it to you, but you don't do cold weather camping in the temperatures you're talking about on a budget.  It's also not something you do ultralite.  At best, you're going to be pretty uncomfortable.  At worst, you'll be putting yourself at significant risk for hypothermia and/or frostbite.  There's a lot of other things to consider than just your sleep system- mode of travel (skis/snowshoes), method of obtaining water (extra fuel for melting snow- chemical treatments are slow and unreliable in cold temps, and purifiers will break if they freeze), type of fuel (canister stoves are generally unreliable in below freezing temps), clothing system (if you're not familiar with it, read up on layering)."

Even with all my layers on I wouldn't want to push my system below 10-15 degrees.    One thing you can do to add warmth is put boiling water in a water bottle and sleep with it in your bag.  Don't drink that water though if you're concerned about plastic leeching."
Ultralight,3arvo2,DSettahr,4,Tue Jun 23 01:17:44 2015 UTC,"You have to be careful with the boiling water in a water bottle, as it can leak if you're not careful.  It is a good idea to let it sit for a few minutes, then crack it open to let the pressure equalize, and re-seal it tightly.  I've found that the pressure build up right after you add the boiling water can cause water bottles (even nalgenes) to leak, especially if there is some ice in the threads of the cap.  Letting it sit for a minute before tossing it in your bag also gives any ice in the threads time to melt before you re-seal it."

Dual hot water nalgenes - one for the feet, one for the crotch.  Stick both feet in a stuff sack and slide the nalgene inside like a hot pocket.  Fleece balaclava...  protect the neck from drafts.  And mittens - even simple ones - but not gloves as they isolate fingers.  Never had to wear insulated trousers to bed.  Now, the pad is more important, in my experience.  Used to stack Therm-a-Rest RidgeRest Deluxes but now carry just an XTherm and maybe a blue pad to double as camp seat.  But always be aware of your abilities and the weather.  I always go to bed hot (hot meal, hot water, exercise activity, hot nalgenes).  If I wake up cold I drink from the crotch nalgene until warmed.  When I wake, I have the foot nalgene to at least have warm water.  And I save enough to melt snow/ice for a warm drink immediately - sometimes before even getting out of the quilt.  It's very important one knows his own abilities before relying on the internet for advice."

Focus on the extremities: head, neck, hands/wrists, feet. It seems like the down beanie will work great; maybe add a buff/balaclava for your neck/nose. Make sure your socks aren't too tight as to restrict blood flow. I would definitely ditch the flannel in favor of fleece.

My take is that the Duplex is clearly much smaller than the Duo and the difference is definitely noticeable. That said, I've also found that on long hikes when you're trying to make miles, the size of the tent doesn't really matter much. You just get in and sleep.   The weight difference between the Duplex and a non-cubed shelter is significant.

Ultralight,3aprcy,unfixablesteve,5,Mon Jun 22 14:43:06 2015 UTC,"Getting caught in snow without the ability to travel on it is a serious situation. The biggest challenge is how will you travel on the soft snow. Basically, how not to posthole. You'll need snowshoes or skis. Snowshoes will work perfectly fine with trail runners. Your feet will get wet (which is fine with mine that always run hot.) Skis are more efficient, but require more skill and are more a pain to carry. I suppose you could figure out how to make a makeshift snowshoe from a tree branch. Not sure how that would work out, but I could see that as a very important skill.  Given that you probably won't be carrying this bulky equipment, you'll need to use your intelligence.  Can you detect the storm ahead of time? Steady afternoon rain will often turn into nighttime snowfall. barometers, weather radios, sat phones can all provide useful information. It's helpful to understand the weather patterns in the area. For example, you have a few days of warning before a storm in the Sierras.  What is the best route to quickly lose elevation? If you can get below the snow line, you'll be fine. This could get a bit tricky in the Winds as there is a quite a bit of flat area. Anyways, bring a good overview map.   In terms of gear, there is no replacement for skis/snowshoes. Next after that I would have a satellite communication device. And then extra food to wait out the storm. More fuel wouldn't hurt. Maybe a bit of accessory cord to make snowshoes?"
Ultralight,3aprcy,Thexorretor,2,Mon Jun 22 17:15:26 2015 UTC,"I've carried snowshoes on my pack before on the off chance that I would end up needing them later on during trip, even though the conditions at the outset didn't warrant them.  Sometimes I ended needing them, other times I didn't.  It was worth carrying them for all the time I didn't need them because not having them for the times I did need them would've majorly sucked."
Ultralight,3aprcy,DSettahr,3,Tue Jun 23 12:28:17 2015 UTC,"That much snow in the Wind River Range isn't unheard of, though fairly rare that time of year. Make sure you check the forecast before you go.  Any amount of extra gear that you bring will obviously increase your pack weight. Heavier boots and gaiters would be a good choice, but since you're in ultralight I would recommend heavy duty garbage bags, zip ties, and use your microspikes over those.  Your average 3-season tent won't hold up to 2 feet of snow on top of it. You would definitely need to shake the snow off the tent every now and then if you were to get stuck in a blizzard."
Ultralight,3aprcy,brianlpowers,4,Mon Jun 22 15:04:34 2015 UTC,"Snowy adventures add serious complications to a backpacking trip.      Snow means low temps. Staying dry is paramount in below freezing conditions. Finger tips and toes need special protection. Snow at near freezing temps means wet and slushy - have your goretex cleaned and prepped so it does not wet out.      I personally always wear waterproof boots in snowy conditions. Not always insulated, but keeping my feet dry in winter is critical for my fun factor. I drop the trail runners when snow hits the ground. Plus gaiters.       I use snowshoes and ski's, depending on the terrain. Anything over 6 inches and they really make the difference, especially if it is on top of old snowpack.       Avalanche education is also important. 2 feet overnight could cause seriously dangerous conditions (although early season it is less likely than on top of an established snow base). Check local avalanche forecasts and know the basics of reading avalanche terrain.       3-season tents don't handle the weight of snow very well. Obviously some better than others. If you awake often to clear off the top/sides it could work - unless it is blowy and they snow could make it into your tent. The problem is that snow is silent. It's the most odd effect - once the smallest layer of snow is on your shelter you don't hear anything. It insulates you from the storm which I love, but can be scary for a tent that is not designed to hold much load. You go to sleep thinking nothing is happening and wake up with the top of your tent touching your face."
Ultralight,3aprcy,cwcoleman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:33:59 2015 UTC,"I got caught in 2 feet of snow in the Smokys with trail runners (Salomons) and had to push 3 days through it. The trail runners themselves were fine and boots would have been no better, but I was worried about too much exposure so I used a couple spare plastic bags to make a vapor barrier. Looked silly but I kept my toes.  I hike with a single staff and that was enough, needed it a few times during some ridge walks. Was lucky enough to have shelters so I didn't have to deal with the tent collapse, but that seems pretty common if you get dumped on with the wet stuff."

A foot of snow isn't bad to walk through - just switch off with the leader/trailblazer every couple miles.  Slide plastic grocer's bags into your shoes help with any meltwater.  Bring a tarp and affix 'lean-to'-style above your tent to offload the snow.  This isn't a blizzard, right?  Just heavy snow?  Obviously gloves and hat.  If the temps don't remain below freezing post-dump everything will be really wet so rain jacket and maybe rain pants (or at least knee-high gaiters)."

The ""2 feet of snow"" scenario is obscuring the more dangerous (and likely) scenario of several days of cold wet rain with wind.  As long as you have some duct tape you will be able to make your boots dry enough to get out - the Winds are narrow enough that a long day can get you out from almost anywhere.  What also matters is what's your plan if you get the snow - continue your trip or bail?  The Winds in September is great - no bugs, you'll have it to yourself.  Have fun."

Ultralight,3aprcy,TheDude--Abides-,0,Mon Jun 22 20:27:55 2015 UTC,This is not true. Only the very small area under a tree (the 'tree well') will have no snow. Once the branches get heavy with snow - they dump it. Camping under trees with heavy/wet snowfall is often more dangerous. The piles of snow come down like bombs - really doing damage to weak tents.        It really depends on the type of snow (temp/weather) and type of trees (pines don't shield well for example). Plus lots of other factors... but in general... sheltering under trees is not a solution for winter camping. It also isn't a solution for traveling in snowy conditions (where snowshoes are key).

If you're fine with dairy, dried cheese is a fantastic addition. Pringles are great. I throw them in a ziplock, but if you don't like them all messed up you can just take a can. Oh, instant mashed potatoes. You can buy a bunch of different dehydrated vegetables relatively cheap on Amazon. Throw the potato powder, vegetables and a vegetable bouillon cube in a ziplock. Add hot water and some olive oil, done. Beans and rice also work pretty well. I soak them over the day in cold water or broth, dump the excess throw in seasoning and heat it up.

Ultralight,3aorkx,arabchic,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:06:02 2015 UTC,"You can cook, most recipes are add hot water only. There are lots of recipes out there and good suggestions here so I'm just going to toss in a few ways to add a few calories to what you have.  Rice flour: thickening sauces into gravy. 2 tablespoons is like 60 calories and doesn't alter the flavor much like some other flours.  TVP: add it to all soupy stuff, few calories and some protein. Makes it more chewy which makes it much more palatable for me as well.  Every time you order a sandwhich anywhere or salad ask if they have oil or dressing packets. They are tons of calories. Add oil to anything that doesn't want dressing. If you make cold couscous do dressing, maybe pine nuts and cran raisins, that is a ton of calories.  Tortillas as far as you can take them. 110 calories each.  If you eat cheese grab some single serving chunks at like world market, add to everything that it makes sense on.  One heavy calorie meal you might not find pre packaged is refried bean and rice burrito mix. You can grab Santa fe brand instant refried beans and minute rice. Just Chuck in some spices and zip lock that. All it takes is some how water. I dunno how veggie you are but that's a favorite vegan thing for me, in the tortillas with a ketchup size pack of tapatio and the secret ingredient if you have it ""true lime"" which is like pure lime seasoning and makes it taste all fresh and great. Without tortillas I like a backpacker's pantry red beans and rice, and you can kill one of those all on your lonesome.  By the way, powdered hummus exists and some is great, especially with tahini powder."

I recently went on a backpacking trip and I never went hungry or got sick of the food that I brought.  If you're OK with the dehydrated meals, there are some pretty decent options from any of the major brands. There's even some organic ones! Every day for dinner I'd have one of those. As for breakfast I would eat and a whole apple (just to cut down on waste), a cliff bar, and coffee. Lunch was normally very quick so I brought hummus in a baggie and clipped the end off to spread it on a pita pocket. Then I had some trail mix to fill me up from there.   All in all, I found that it wasn't as hard as I thought and really enjoyed what I brought along."

Pack tortillas and you've got burritos!  Make a lil' hobo stove, get a cheap grease pot, and bring a bottle of denatured alcohol. Boiling water's all you need.  Jellybeans for raw calories.  Play around with making your own trail mix from the bulk bins at your supermarket, you can throw some pretty satiating mixes together.   Hard cheese keeps well for a few days. Put it on everything. Cornmeal (polenta), instant potatoes, ramen noodles, and instant rice are staples. Add olive oil for flavor and calories.  If you're only going out for a few days you can pack fresh veggies and steam/roast them. Tofu dogs also last a while out of refrigeration if you're cooking on fires.  Pretty sure I eat better in the woods than I do at home."

Ultralight,3ap6eb,storunner13,7,Mon Jun 22 18:42:16 2015 UTC,"First let me say I know very little about the Bob Gross drama, but thought it was worth mentioning in the OP, as that's the latest going on over there right now.  Part of the point of this was to find out what happened with that whole thing.  I liked Bob's contributions from time to time, though I admit I don't read BPL forums that often anymore.  Anyhow, here's my general take on BPL:   If you want to learn about UL backpacking, you don't need to buy a membership there.  I never did, and in the past 5 or so years that I've been a student of UL, I've found the forums there to be useful sure, but other things like blogs and Youtube even more useful. I am generally against websites charging for information, period.  So you can guess how I feel about BPL's member's only texts, videos, etc.  I firmly believe that this kind of content should be free, and put my money where my mouth is regarding this with my own blog/vlog.  I have no adverts on my blog/vlog, and make no money off of it.  Of course they are free to do as they please and charge whatever they want for whatever content and freedom, liberty, etc. and all that.  Not saying otherwise, just to be clear.  But I'm also free not to buy it. The forums are clunky and outdated.  I get that the whole minimal design of the forums are consistent with the whole mindset of UL (whatever that means), but I have posted less and less there due to it being a PITA to post pictures, links, find old posts, etc. The gear swap on BPL is one of the best places to buy/sell UL gear.  I've bought a lot of gear on there and sold some as well.  It's worth it to pay the minimum forum fee of 5 bucks just for gear swap--though as I said I don't like that one now as to pay in order to use the forums. Perhaps I've missed it, but I haven't really seen much response to criticisms from the staff and/or authors of the content at BPL.  Off the top of my head, last year or so (maybe two years ago?) there was a members only article on UL tents.  I noticed on the forums that several people were not that happy with the text, and very little (nothing?) was said in response from staff/author.  There was one time when I told a moderator there (Roger) he was being condescending to me during a discussion (which he was), and he just denied it rather than say sorry or try and see things from my perspective.   Just some thoughts off the top of my head.  I hope no one at BPL takes this personal or anything.  Discourse is a good thing, right?"
Ultralight,3ap6eb,ArchdeaconWeasel,2,Mon Jun 22 11:26:19 2015 UTC,"I think you've made some good points.  The forums are awful, gear swap is a fantastic resource, and god forbid you hint at disagreeing with some of the original members.  Paying for content is definitely outdated.  I'm not an expert on the history, but when BPL was in its infancy and information on the internet wasn't as widespread, operating as a subscription periodical was probably the best route--mimicking backpacker magazine with a strict Ultralight / push-the-envelope focus.  Contributers were compensated for their writing, and subscribers funded the content.  Now that there is so much free, easy-to-find information on every topic imaginable, it is difficult to create content that is worth paying for (i.e. exclusive, well written), and even harder to do that consistently.  I do love lurking in the forums and watching members throw the gloves off over minute details.  Also, I can only imagine that Bob Gross is still using his Apple II with Netscape.  In case you were wondering, Bob Gross takes everyone's wording and phrasing in the MOST literal way, and always corrects you tactlessly.  If you mentioned ""It was raining cats and dogs"", B.G. would reply ""were there animal corpses all over the place? That must have been  quite the mess."""

Ultralight,3ap6eb,ArchdeaconWeasel,4,Mon Jun 22 15:55:24 2015 UTC,"My opinion, Compared to other forums, you get better advice and discussions on BPL than your will get on any other backpacking forum, including Reddit.  BPL tends be active with real long distance hikers as well as people who engineer and test backpacking gear.  There are far less trolls, curmudgeons and advice from inexperienced outfitter salespeople than on the other forums.  Any of the bogus posts quickly get shot down be the experienced people.  I used to follow White Blaze, because a lot of backpackers recommended it, but it didn't take long to figure out that the advice was usually not very good and the discussion seemed to be coming from people who only do car camping, or short hikes.  Reddit also suffers from this. Most of the people giving advice seem to be against light backpacking or are inexperienced."

Ultralight,3ap6eb,Mr-Yellow,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:26:40 2015 UTC,"I found some great DIY/modification etc. discussion in the forums. Found some interesting people pushing ultralight to a radical, experimental extreme that neither industry nor I are likely to approach, which can be an insightful boon to the hobby. Found some politics and infighting and some strange attitudes from the mods.   I seem to recall some interesting articles, but when they went to a subscription model the articles were not sufficient to make me interested in paying. if I were a high-end gear junkie, more of the articles would be relevant to me and the subscription fee would be negligible relative to cost of the latest, greatest gear; but that's not my approach. And paying for a forum seems odd when there are a million free alternatives. Does a pay gate filter for those who are serious and informed? Maybe, but I'd bet there are a lot of serious, informed people who can't be bothered with paying to use a website.  I'd probably spend a bit more time lurking there if a higher percentage of their articles were freely available, but mostly I've faded because my gear setup is in ok shape for my needs right now and I don't feel like paying the fees.  Oh, and their search system suuucked every time I used it. Been a while though, hope it's fixed."

It's quite slow, but back flushing often does help with this (I didn't use the syringe just a smart water bottle top). It leaks on the dirty side, especially if you over tighten it. Took me a few days to find the sweet spot for no leaks. One time the whole filter popped off the dirty water bag dousing my water bottle with dirty water. I used chlorine dioxide tabs to re sanitize, I highly recommend taking some. I used msr brand ones and I carried ~20 and weighed less than a wet nap.  I'm going to get a gravity bag type filter for my next trip. If I used a Sawyer again I would get the larger size just for the flow rate and lower clogging potential. It kind of sucks standing in the rain/bugs squeezing a leaky bag trying to prevent cross contamination for 20 minutes to get 3 L of water."
Ultralight,3anhst,0ptyc,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:47:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the comment. I had never heard of the smart water bottle to backflush. I will get one for this purpose. Thanks.
Ultralight,3anhst,slowtreme,2,Wed Jun 24 00:04:42 2015 UTC,"Depending on your water source you'll need to flush it every couple days or sooner, some times every source if it's dirty. IMO as an owner of a mini, get the Squeeze. It's a tiny bit more weight, but the flow rate clean and ""dirty"" make up for it. I was trying to be cheap and it just made my water chores take longer."
Ultralight,3anhst,publicharmony,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:36:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment. I have the mini and asked the question about failure due to my concern that it may fail early. I love the mini so far. What is the ""Squeeze"" though? It sounds like I should get that."

Ultralight,3anhst,BadderBanana,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:36:59 2015 UTC,"I also recommend getting the full size Squeeze.  I got the Mini first, was mostly satisfied with it, but was disappointed with the flow rate and how often I had to back flush it (nearly every water source).  I recently bought the Squeeze, and it is worlds better than the mini.  Much higher flow rate, and I haven't had a need to back flush it while out in the woods yet (2-3 day trips usually).  It can wait to be back flushed until I get home."
Ultralight,3anhst,slippery_hippo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:20:46 2015 UTC,Great. Thanks for the advice. I do this already. My worry was about early failure. I have had the mini for a couple of years without a problem but I had a lifestraw fail very early and I was worried about having only one method of water purification.
Ultralight,3anhst,BadderBanana,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:10:24 2015 UTC,I agree with  you. I like it so much better than my pump MSR filter...and about 1/8th of the weight.

I always think that I can settle down with one tarp or one underquilt, and I always end up selling and buying two or more specialized pieces down the road. Took me two years to realize that if I'm buying something new, to just buy the best item for the trip, and get something else for different conditions in the future. YMMV."
Ultralight,3akjdc,SkyShadow,3,Sun Jun 21 15:49:33 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'm the opposite. I tend to favor versatility. I would rather have one kit that I can adapt to every situation than have to break in something new every season.

Ultralight,3akjdc,jcrocket,3,Sun Jun 21 20:54:05 2015 UTC,"Go ultralight where you can, but don't forgo a few luxury items on principle. For me, it's the double-wall coffee mug. Yeah, I could drink instant from the cook pot, but I like the ritual of making and enjoying a real cup of coffee in the morning. And also bring a book... and bourbon... and my big goofy Crocs. I could get my base under 11 pounds, but it would be at the expense of comfort. I'm happy carrying around 15.   http://lighterpack.com/r/11l7sg"
Ultralight,3akjdc,WindowShoppingMyLife,3,Sun Jun 21 22:55:40 2015 UTC,I suppose we should add that going with a good 100 proof bourbon is more effective for its weight than a standard 80 proof variety as well. Every gram counts.
Ultralight,3akjdc,alpinepete,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:35:06 2015 UTC,"I too like the double-wall mug. I tend to burn my tongue on hot liquids, and burning my tongue would put a damper on my outdoor fun."
Ultralight,3akjdc,scfoothills,7,Mon Jun 22 00:47:00 2015 UTC,"While buying a lighter pack, tent and sleeping bag are definitely the highest impact changes, I find that for most people I hike with the easiest and cheapest way for them to carry less is by bringing different clothing.  Examples:   heavy fleece jacket vs. down sweater Driducks vs. goretex jacket Two pairs of socks vs. four Heavy softshell hiking pants vs. running shorts and wind pants  The other thing I'd offer is that many people pack sleeping bags that are way too heavy and fail to utilize their clothing as part of their sleep system.  Do you really need a 20 degree bag in the summer? What about a 40 degree bag and wearing that down sweater to bed?   One good ultralight LPT is to select and bring clothing that can all be worn at the same time. So that when you need it, you can wear everything you brought.   I like to extend that thinking to include my sleeping bag. At the coldest point in my trip I aim to wear all my clothes insides my sleeping bag/quilt. That way I know I packed all the insulation I need and nothing more."
Ultralight,3akjdc,alpinepete,5,Wed Jul 1 06:58:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I totally disagree with down wearables in ultralight backpacking, they have their place. However I've been coming to find that a fleece is just way more versatile, easier to maintain and in some situations a lot nicer to have. Down jackets have become so damn trendy in the past few years, that there's this assumption that you absolutely always need one."
Ultralight,3akjdc,WindowShoppingMyLife,2,Sun Jun 21 17:59:25 2015 UTC,"I agree, there is a place for fleece...I especially like using it in the winter. I just see a lot of people carrying multiple layers, including heavy fleece, in dry summer conditions and I don't think that makes a ton of sense. I'd also say that I think synthetic puffy layers also have a place in the UL quiver and I find I'm using those more as well.   Still, for a beginner, I'd try to make sure they consider a down sweater as lightweight option for around camp and as part of sleep system instead of a fleece that weighs more and insulates less."
Ultralight,3akjdc,BarelyAnyFsGiven,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:06:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah man. My old GoLite synthetic puffy vest is one of my favorite pieces of gear. I can sweat into it, I can wear it under my drysuit kayaking, I can sit by a fire and not worry about it burning, I can trad climb in it without worrying about ripping it open in squeezes or chimneys. It's fantastic and well worn."
Ultralight,3akjdc,WindowShoppingMyLife,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:00:38 2015 UTC,Very well put. I often tend to focus more so on gear and less on clothing and sleeping (i work more with the hardware). Revisiting and revising my insulation pages thanks for the help!! cheers!
Ultralight,3akjdc,alpinepete,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:59:24 2015 UTC,This is great advice. In the winter I always end up wearing my jacket to bed anyway. Probably better to just plan on it.
Ultralight,3akjdc,s_s,6,Sun Jun 21 20:42:05 2015 UTC,"The quickest way to lighten the load is by addressing the Big 3: Pack, Shelter, and Sleep system. Here is a link to my ultralight backpacking gear list.  http://www.ultralightbackpackergear.com/ultralight_gear_list.html"
Ultralight,3akjdc,scfoothills,3,Sun Jun 21 23:29:13 2015 UTC,"I'll add that reducing VOLUME should be a huge consideration when trying to reduce the impact of the big three. It isn't just the weight of down that is helpful, it's the compressibility. Then think about packing items so they nest. For example, the stove in the cookpot. The pack itself can be a huge contributor to weight, and reducing volume is what allows you to take a smaller and therefore lighter backpack."
Ultralight,3akjdc,draftymcbuff,2,Sun Jun 21 04:25:27 2015 UTC,Yes unfortunately they have redesigned all their packs and as a result the weights went up and the names changed. Zpacks has a line of ultralight backpacks that start at 4 oz. http://www.zpacks.com/backpacks.shtml
Ultralight,3akjdc,mvmntsofthemind,3,Sun Jun 21 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"I haven't even checked the link, but that just blows my mind. I'm pretty sure my boxer shorts weigh more than that."

Ultralight,3akjdc,scfoothills,2,Sun Jun 21 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"-Don't carry more water than you need. Obviously this comes down to a personal assessment, but so many hikers feel compelled to top off their carrying capacity at each source. Every liter is 2.2 lbs, and that often gets overlooked in the UL world as everyone focuses on base weight. Ditto for food. Food and water are going to be the heaviest things you carry.   -Don't waste space/weight on camp shoes.  -You really only need 2 pairs of socks. One pair to walk in, one pair that stays dry for camp. Every time I've taken a friend on a first hike, they pack more socks than I own.   -Make a spreadsheet to keep track of base weight. It's the only way you'll get a handle on where you're heavy and what needs improvement."

Ultralight,3aejgi,isaidDONTPANIC,3,Fri Jun 19 14:01:59 2015 UTC,"So you have the double layer 1.1, correct?  If you don't mind me asking, how much do you weigh?  I've lost a lot of weight over the last couple of years and, just last week, decided on the much lighter 1.1 single layer from my heavy as balls 1.7oz double layer.  I also lightened my suspension by swapping out the Amsteel whoopies for Dynaglide whoopies.   Your tarp's heavy, too.  Don't get me wrong, that's a terrific tarp, but if you have the budget, consider going cuben.  I have the cuben tarp with doors from Hammock Gear and it comes in at 6.5oz, versus your current 19oz.  Leave the quilt liner at home - no need.  Have you considered going 3/4 length UQ instead of full length?  Dropping the Incubator for the Phoenix 20, you'd shed another 8oz.  Definitely don't take the 2nd pair of leggings, redundant.  That DriDucks will be destroyed in a month - the seams are shit and they don't hold up for long, especially with the miles you'll be crushing.  I dropped a few quid on the Montbell Versalite rain jacket.  Other than going cuben/silnylon, this is one of the lightest on the market - and it has pit zips.  Big knife, leave it at home.  Have you considered the much smaller Leatherman Style CS multitool?  Great gear list, we share a lot of the same choices for pack / hammock, etc.  Here's my Lighterpack link if you want to take a peek:  http://lighterpack.com/r/5r50nu"

I hammock-camp too, and I made a hammock with Dutch's poly fabric... my hammock, bugnet, and all the rigging weighs 16oz... and I am making a hex tarp that will weigh about 12 oz.  (maybe 15oz with line/stakes?).  So keeping a hammock, but making a lighter one could be considered :)"
Ultralight,3aejgi,you-vandal,2,Fri Jun 19 14:09:33 2015 UTC,My hammock is so heavy! How much would you estimate you will spend in total to make yours? I don't know if I could justify spending more money when the BB was so expensive in the first place...but it would be nice to cut that weight in half.
Ultralight,3aejgi,kimchi2525,2,Fri Jun 19 14:18:21 2015 UTC,"I started out with a 1.1 Single Layer Blackbird, with whoopies, which is something 18 or 19 oz. according to their site. We actually have a very similar gear list, and in my quest to lighten my hammock, I've recently come to the conclusion I will build my own hammock. I was initially really stoked to get a DreamHammock, but by doing it myself, I can use 1.0oz fabric, size it to me and remove excess, but keep things like a bugnet, footbox, etc. After all my math, it seems like this might save me 4-5 oz over the BB, and keep all the features I want. I'd love to share resources, as I've found a lot of instructions online recently. Should come to around $100. Point being, you have lots of options, and by posting a BB on /r/geartrade or /r/hammockcamping , you will get it sold immediately if you're worried about cost.   If you can justify spending the money, a cuben tarp would certainly cut a lot of weight, but I'm still saving up for mine. The HG tarp with doors I want will save me 6oz over my current Silnylon tarp, a MacCat Deluxe.  A lot goes into clothing also, but I hesitate to make assumptions, as that's a personal preference."

Ultralight,3ac1w1,beansancoffee,0,Fri Jun 19 01:28:48 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I am wrong but aren't some products sold thru REI outlets different than normal.   Someone said the REI 2 person dome tent was a lb heavier.   That might not matter to some people,  but beware of what you're buying."
Ultralight,3ac1w1,BadderBanana,3,Fri Jun 19 17:47:02 2015 UTC,"Last year's version of the half dome is on outlet, and it is about a pound heavier than the updated version. Outlet is usually old items that have since been updated or discontinued. Sometimes the update is a full design change and sometimes all they do is change the color, so it is worth it to do a little comparison of last year's vs. this year's version because you can save a lot if you don't mind having last year's color of an otherwise identical product."
Ultralight,3ac1w1,relig_study,5,Thu Jun 18 22:49:57 2015 UTC,Rei outlet is typically just items that aren't selling well so they are marked down to get rid of and make room for new product.
Ultralight,3ac1w1,PotatoCasserole,4,Fri Jun 19 15:43:41 2015 UTC,"There have been some cases where this was true. For instance, the Big Agnes Seedhouse a while back was a slightly different, and heavier, model made specifically for REI outlet."

Ultralight,3adctc,Muadibz,3,Fri Jun 19 04:56:37 2015 UTC,"Cold and wet = fleece/synthetics Cold and dry = down  Example, ice climbing benefits from synthetic (not necessarily fleece because it is heavy compared to something like Primaloft One)."
Ultralight,3adctc,summiter,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:53:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  And I also think the subject of this post should have been more specific to include ""base layers""... because as it reads now, it is just an open-ended question... it could also apply to sleeping bags, quilts, jackets, etc. that are often ""synthetics vs down"" and not ""fleece vs down"".  But, to answer the question in my own way... you have down base layers such as the crazy popular MH Ghost Whisperer and the Patagonia Nano Puff.  Putting them up against the Patagonia Cap3Hoodie or the Arc'teryx Fortrez Hoody or the RAB vapour. Honestly, I think it just call comes down to personal preference."
Ultralight,3adctc,abela,3,Fri Jun 19 09:55:48 2015 UTC,"""Puffy"" kind of indicates that it's a garment."
Ultralight,3adctc,swampwalker906,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:24:46 2015 UTC,I've also heard fleece is better insulation while moving.
Ultralight,3adctc,roboconcept,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:35:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, its hard to for anyone to give a judgement on this.  I hike in freezing conditions with a 100wt fleece, but when I stop and dry off I want a puffy.  Really depends on this conditions, your level of exertion, etc.  Best way to learn is to get out there and learn yourself."
Ultralight,3adctc,supernettipot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:32:20 2015 UTC,"Fleece and wool don't compress like down/primaloft does, so I like wearing it to bed so that my back isn't colder than my front.  I don't see why you wouldn't at least bring a lightweight fleece (100 wt.) at all times because it is very versatile.  It works well both as active wear and sleep wear.  Primaloft and especially down are much more situational/tempermental.  Only bring those if it will get below freezing, imho."
Ultralight,3abmtv,vingt_et_un,6,Thu Jun 18 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to go item but item but a few observations.  1) you don't need to include the weight of a full water bottle, your base weight doesn't include liquids and food  2) Your sleeping bag and backpack weigh a ton. If you're gonna cut weight fast - do it there.  3) I feel like you don't have a lot of stuff listed. carried clothes, rain gear, first aid and you have a lot of duplication. 2 flashlights, spork and a spoon, you are carrying a hammock and a chair which is the beauty of a hammock - it is a chair.   Just a few thoughts to get you started, but you're on the right path and that path weighs a lot less!"
Ultralight,3abmtv,beetbear,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:11:21 2015 UTC,"thanks for the advice!  Any other weighing advice you have? I guess I figured to weigh the nalgene bottle as full, as that's usually how I carry it.   Thanks again for your input!"
Ultralight,3abmtv,beetbear,2,Thu Jun 18 20:13:44 2015 UTC,"One thing I did for a long time was going out for weekend trips and take an excel sheet with me. I'd mark each time I used something and then remove stuff that I never used. You'd be surprised how much you bring and never actually utilize. This let me get my kit down to essentials, then I actually added in a few comforts to get to where my kit is now."
Ultralight,3abmtv,jr12345,5,Thu Jun 18 20:33:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sure some people will ring in with ""Not Ultralight"" and thats okay. I don't think anyone got into this hobby with ultralight gear anyhow.  With that said, theres room for improvement all over, which I'm sure you already know. Just remember to upgrade your pack last!    Get a Sawyer Mini/Squeeze and shave ~7 oz. off SnowPeak MiniSolo will shave another ~3 oz. off Ditch the chair, use a log or a rock(or a bear canister if you ever have to use one) No need to have both a flashlight and a headlamp Getting a different sleeping bag(or a quilt) could save you up to 40 oz. Getting a different pack(once you've upgraded everything else) could save you up to 40 oz. as well Why do you have two tarps? I'm sure you could get a sil-nylon(or cuben) tarp and shave some weight off as well"
Ultralight,3abmtv,beetbear,2,Thu Jun 18 20:18:17 2015 UTC,My only note here is that the Standard Sawyer while weighing a tiny bit more works a million times better. I have both and I kick myself for buying the mini although I keep it in my car kit as a JIC SHTF option.
Ultralight,3abmtv,cleggett,2,Thu Jun 18 20:31:37 2015 UTC,"I wish more people knew this! Everyone hypes the Mini, but the flow rate is sooooo slooooow. Go with the Squeeze!"
Ultralight,3abmtv,summiter,3,Thu Jun 25 20:49:43 2015 UTC,"Go through each item and ask,   ""Do I need this?""  ""And I mean really NEED this?""    ""Like, if I forgot it at home I would have the WORST time... I may even cancel the trip""  And then go over the items you decided you ABSOLUTELY NEEDED and ask,  ""Does this seem heavy?""  ""Like, is there something lighter I could use?  And is it worth the cost?""  ""And again, do I really nneeeeedd to bring this?""  That's the essence of the practicing UL'er  Example:  camp chair.  Not needed.  Also, lighter options available. Example:  bug netting.  Are there bugs?  Maybe not needed.  Also, 1lb for a bug net?!"
Ultralight,3abmtv,mrjowee,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:22:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's correct for that bug net. The ENO hammock, net, and atlas straps are extremely heavy. Similar products from cottage vendors are the same size (or bigger) and about half the weight. The same goes for the Doublenest hammock. Lots of people dip their toes into hammock camping with ENO products because they have market recognition and you can walk into a brick and mortar store and buy them, or get them from the same place you buy all of your other hiking essentials.  Oh, and his hammock can double as a camp chair, even if it's just for lunch. A hammock by itself can be deployed in maybe a minute, depending on suspension type. Some are small enough to be used for only this purpose and taken as a luxury item for those weirdos who prefer tents."
Ultralight,3abmtv,Almostcomatose,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:57:42 2015 UTC,"I was looking at that hammock weight thinking, what the hell, 4.2 lbs to sleep in a hammock? Why are people doing this?"
Ultralight,3abmtv,paleal3s,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:20:04 2015 UTC,I am a weirdo who loves tents and hates hammocks. Yes i have used hammocks and hated it. I have back problems and hammocks just suck for me. But my tent is only 26 oz so it's probably just as light as a hammock.
Ultralight,3abmtv,mrjowee,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:41:16 2015 UTC,"Most people switch to hammocks for other reasons besides weight. They're not much lighter, if at all."
Ultralight,3abmtv,paleal3s,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:00:43 2015 UTC,Why then? I don't really understand why people would choose a hammock over tent.

Ultralight,3abmtv,mrjowee,2,Sun Jun 21 02:20:03 2015 UTC,"I should probably note that I am a novice hiker and enjoy some luxuries.   You will also notice the fact I have 2 tarps, 200' paracord, 2 water filters and 2 utensils. All of which I could cut down on, but I am more curious on anything else that jumps out at you.   Thanks in advance for any help!"
Ultralight,3abmtv,buddboy,2,Thu Jun 18 20:08:34 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge fan of the Trangia Mini stove kit, and I've been noticing people seem to favor isobutane. It's an easy way to drop several ounces.  If you have to have extra cordage, you might want to look into Zing-it. It's a 450lb line but much slammer than parachord, not as stretchy (not stretchy at all, in fact), and slides better when bear bagging.  Why the extra tarp? You already have one.   I'd ditch the chair as well. I like my hammock more than any camp chair I've tried.  When the funds are there, you can save a good deal of weight by swapping out the ENO hammock, bugnet, and suspension for a cottage vendor equivalent. Dutchware hammocks are about 10oz lighter, bugnets are 9 or 10 less as well. A Dutchware hammock with suspension is like $75, but will probably be too long for your bugnet. A full coverage zipper entrance net is close to $80. You could go Fronkey stile for like $50, and it's even lighter."

Ultralight,3aazbq,Yellow_Rain,3,Thu Jun 18 17:08:35 2015 UTC,What is smart water cap in regards to back flushing sawyer?
Ultralight,3aazbq,evandena,5,Thu Jun 18 17:41:01 2015 UTC,"I got the idea from Joe Brewer in this video. Basically the flip-top cap fits perfectly into the little spout on the filter, so you can just squeeze the Smartwater bottle with clean water to backflush, rather than bringing the syringe!"

Ultralight,3aazbq,Simco_,2,Thu Jun 18 18:25:47 2015 UTC,"Heading on the Bruce Trail for the first time this weekend. I got my base weight down to 10.22 lbs including camera gear (cell phone, extra batteries, and a lightweight Gorillapod. Total weight is 19.71 lbs which includes food, 2L (67oz) water, and canister fuel, and first aid ice packs (I know, don't ask).  Friday (after work): driving to Niagara Falls (2hrs), hiking 12km. Saturday: hiking 20km Sunday: hiking 8km, then driving home  Feel free to critique or ask questions!  More comments are here on my x-post to /r/backpacking"
Ultralight,3aazbq,GetMentalGetWeird,2,Thu Jun 18 17:08:43 2015 UTC,You seem to hit a few redundancies.   A liner and a cover.  A rain jacket and a wind shell.  Two compasses.  Extra batteries for both a phone and a flashlight on a 48 hour trip.    Have you found all of these to be necessary in previous trips?
Ultralight,3aazbq,Simco_,2,Thu Jun 18 18:06:15 2015 UTC,"I sure do.   I carry two compasses because the Suunto Clipper is only 6g (0.2oz) and I like the peace of mind. I've read that in situations where people are lost, they stop trusting the needle on their compass. Having two would be reassuring.   The cover is for keeping things dry in the outside mesh pouch. Also, a wet pack is heavier, and at 42g (1.5oz) I decided it would be worth it (since a wet pack probably soaks up more than 42ml of water).  I bring the wind shell to hike in if it gets cold. At 58g (2.04oz), it's hard to leave at home. It's not very comfortable hiking in a raincoat, but the wind coat feels like you're wearing nothing and adds a surprising amount of warmth. I also decided not to bring my Patagonia Nano Puff, so my only ""insulating"" layers are my Patagonia Cap2 long-sleeve shirt, wind shell, raincoat, and merino wool Buff.  The extra AAA battery for my flashlight weighs 10g (0.35oz), and doubles the burntime from 15 to 30 hours.  The extra batteries for my phone will probably not be necessary. But I do plan on taking some timelapses with my phone, as well as using it as my GPS, so I decided to bring them. I plan on taking a lot of video and posting it on my YouTube channel."
Ultralight,3aazbq,abela,2,Thu Jun 18 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"The cover is for keeping things dry in the outside mesh pouch.    Maybe I'm missing something, but doesn't the outside pack cover negate the need for the liner?"
Ultralight,3aazbq,ultralightdude,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:10:38 2015 UTC,"Well, a liner is far more effective than a cover, but yes. It's a redundant system that I can't seem to convince myself to remove. Maybe it's a habit from canoe camping."
Ultralight,3aazbq,mrjowee,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:46:49 2015 UTC,You seem to be equating necessary with not that heavy on some of these.
Ultralight,3abh8v,ukuleleben,2,Thu Jun 18 19:18:23 2015 UTC,"I love hiking in my Koi cargo scrubs. I have them in grey and tons of people ask me where I got my ""fancy hiking pants"".... I find they wick away outside moisture pretty well (versatile for both urine/blood at work and rain outside on the trail :p) would recommend :)"
Ultralight,3abh8v,1palepacific,2,Thu Jun 18 21:52:34 2015 UTC,They make running pants.
Ultralight,3abh8v,brewyet,4,Fri Jun 19 10:46:52 2015 UTC,"Never tried them. Spent enough years wearing scrubs, the idea of wearing them out on the trail... nope :-D  There is no doubt they would be lighter and less expensive than the very popular Columbia Convertibles that a lot of hikers wear these days.  Another option would be to go the windpants route. Just having something to cut the wind from your legs while wearing shorts. I have been doing this for the last 1600+ days out on the trail and it is still working out for me.  I wear a pair of shorts and then wind pants, and if it gets really cold I will slip on a pair of next-to-skin baselayer pants (patagonia cap 1, for example - something really lightweight, very little bulk/volume inside your pack, and just enough warmth to cut the chill on your legs) is almost identical to the method you are talking about.  One interesting aspect (and my days in the medical field, I never paid attention to this) would be how heavy the scrubs get when/if they get wet from rain/creaks. I am thinking they would get pretty water logged and thus pretty dang heavy, maybe even heavier than a pair of Columbia's (??).  Anyway, interesting idea @ukuleleben  -- if you give it a go, I would love to hear how it works out!"
Ultralight,3acf6a,Mambo_5,4,Thu Jun 18 23:40:20 2015 UTC,You can't wear waterproof pants all the time. They do not breathe and you will sweat your balls off

Ultralight,3acf6a,matthewrozon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:41:00 2015 UTC,I guess I never really considered they would be so hot in shorts form.  I was really hoping to shave off 9oz from my pack.
Ultralight,3acf6a,turn0,3,Fri Jun 19 14:45:34 2015 UTC,Look into rain skirts
Ultralight,3acf6a,travelinzac,3,Fri Jun 19 15:25:37 2015 UTC,"As /u/matthewrozon has pointed out, you may want to try a rain kilt/skirt.

Ultralight,3acf6a,supernettipot,2,Sat Jun 20 20:40:38 2015 UTC,"Why not ditch the zipoffs for a pair of 2-3oz trail running shorts and carry the waterproof ones? Then you have your bases covered, no need for the zip off other pants really. If it's cold wear thermals under the shorts. If it gets wet you can just put the waterproof ones on over the shorts. I wouldn't want to wear a waterproof pair of shorts though, I'm sure even as a woman you're susceptible to swampass; and that just takes your hike to a whole new level of fun."
Ultralight,3a6uw9,vlitzer,5,Wed Jun 17 18:12:43 2015 UTC,"I have one of these I carry now and then... it's cheap and very light, and I doubt it's worthwhile for stargazing with just an 18mm aperture, but it's great in the daylight for squinting at faraway birds and stuff.  Edit: if you get it, and the image is terrible, send it back.  I thought it was just an awful product, but after I got it exchanged, the replacement was tack-sharp."
Ultralight,3a6uw9,raygundan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:23:48 2015 UTC,"So what (if any) is the difference between a monocular and a telescope? Is it size, or focal distance?"
Ultralight,3a6uw9,seanomenon,2,Wed Jun 17 22:11:14 2015 UTC,"I think technically, ""monocular"" is just a word we use for small telescopes.  Both binoculars and monoculars are commonly (though probably not always) either roof- or porro-prism optics.  A lot of the common telescope designs we think of when we hear the word (refractor designs, newtonian reflector designs, etc...) produce upside-down images and are bulky for the same magnification-- while prism designs are compact and light and produce right-side-up images.  So... although they're technically telescopes, it kinda-sorta seems like we use the words ""binocular"" and ""monocular"" to refer to small prism-type telescopes, at least informally."
Ultralight,3a6uw9,raygundan,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:47:21 2015 UTC,"That makes lots of sense, thanks."

Ultralight,3a6uw9,WindowShoppingMyLife,2,Wed Jun 17 22:46:21 2015 UTC,"I think technically, monoculars just are telescopes you use with one eye, and binoculars are just telescopes for both eyes.  But what they call ""binoculars"" and ""monoculars"" at the store are usually prism-based optic designs-- so I think it's kinda just come to mean that.  If you buy a monocular, you're getting half a pair of binoculars, by which they mean a prism-based telescope design."

Pushing the gear outside its limits is where the concern would be (ie. if the loops can withstand holding skis for significant periods of time/multiple trips (assuming they're just pole/ice pick loops?), material durability, etc.)  It's been nice transferring UL to more a philosophy (as elitist as it can appear sometimes); I've found myself evaluating possessions across multiple hobbies (fishing, as mentioned, or woodworking and such).

Ultralight,3a16u0,Yeah-BUDDY,12,Tue Jun 16 12:42:03 2015 UTC,"PCT 2013 Alumni here. After a quick look at you gear list my first impression is its pretty solid.   Lots and lots of PCTers use ULA Circuit (Lots use the Catalyst also depending on their load) and almost all I talked to about the packs were happy with them (though you can always go lighter i.e. zpacks, six moons, etc.). You can go lighter on that sleeping bag too if you are willing to spend the money.   I'd say the one thing that sticks out is that camera. Totally personal preference. If you want to take some nice pictures I don't blame you. You will be in some of the most beautiful places on the planet. There were a couple hikers I knew carrying SLRs like that and they had some amazing images from the hike. BUT maybe just consider a smaller one.   My base weight leaving the boarder was around 12 lbs and I had an amazing hike. I don't think your 15.25 is too far off. There will be hikers leaving the boarder with WAY heavier packs. I met a lot of them. And a lot of them finished. On a hike like this one, 5+ months, you have to decide what are the compromises you want to make, weight vs. comfort. It's totally up to you."
Ultralight,3a16u0,Ping_Pong17,2,Tue Jun 16 16:35:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I did a decent amount of looking at other peoples PCT kit lists, so had help in putting it together.  The Catalyst is bigger, but costs about 40% more and adds 300 grams, so I reckon I'll stick with the smaller bag. Carrying the bear canister as well is a slight concern though.  I understand the camera comment. With just one lens and charger its adding 800 grams, so would be an easy way to cut weight, but I reckon for me its worth it as a luxury item. If I can get save enough though I am considering a far lighter option for that."
Ultralight,3a16u0,kid775,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:08:28 2015 UTC,"Try going with a GoPro if you just want to document your journey and not so much take photos. I don't want to sound like a snob but the kit lens won't suffice in the nature, and getting a better one requires some serious $$$ and weighs more. In my experience a point and shoot is often better, more compact and lighter than the 'amateur' DLSRs.   Obviously it's more fun to shoot DSLR, but I'm just talking from experience. I have a 60D and an ok lens, a Tamron 17-55 and I almost never take them out because holy shit that is heavy. I prefer my old film camera instead. It's light, no need to charge the batteries (nice in the middle of nowhere) and you can send off the film to a friend when you're done with the roll. Best part: you'll end up actually looking at the pictures once you're done with PCT.  So maybe consider a point and shoot, a GoPro (you can time it to take a photo every minute or whatever if you want!) or even a film camera instead of that DSLR."
Ultralight,3a16u0,dmnsavage,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:29:28 2015 UTC,"PCT '13 alum here - had great happiness with the ULA Circuit, though I have HAPPILY switched to the Osprey Exos 58. The weight is comparable, but the suspension on the Osprey carries a load much more comfortably. Plus, you will never suffer from swampback and the accompanying chafe.   You could skip the PEAK capture kit - get some zcord and double-gated s-carabiners, and you can lash the DSLR to the front of your shoulder straps for mere grams (and a much-reduced cost). I use the sternum strap to stabilize the camera against sway, and have a Ultrapod II permanently fixed to the bottom of the camera body (better use of the weight saved from the camera mount). When the tripod legs are stowed, you can use that as a lower stabilizer by tucking it into the waist belt. With the counterbalance this setup provides, you'll notice the weight less. Plus, the camera is always right there. I have a small sea-to-summit silnylon dry bag on a shock cord right next to the camera for donning/doffing quickly in wet/dusty conditions.  I didn't have my DSLR on the trail when I thru-hiked - I used a Canon S110. Great camera, but not the same. When I hike again I'll have the big camera.  For my bride and I, we had the Caldera Tri-ti system. I now have Jetboil Sumo Ti, and would never go back. You're not sauteeing on a thru-hike, you're boiling water and eating quickly, something that the jetboil does with ease. It is also MUCH more fire-safe, and finding fuel is no problem. As other posters have mentioned, you start getting to a break-even point in total system weight beyond a couple days.   No need for a rain jacket and an umbrella in the desert. Send your rain jacket forward to where you'll need it and hike with a DWR-treated wind shirt in the desert.   Skip the kindle and load ebooks to your phone. Similarly, you can take notes/trail journal entries straight to your phone.  You could double down on smartwater/gatorade bottles instead of platypus bladders. Modular=add/subtract as conditions call for.   A polycryo groundsheet will trim some grams, but tyvek is generally more sturdy (esp. for the desert). The polycryo will last, but you may go through them more quickly.   Watch out for the Ion headlamp - since the switch is electronic, it requires a certain threshold voltage to turn on/off. I've had that thing crap out on me in the middle of the woods, in the middle of the night, after turning it off for a few minutes (ironically to save batteries) more times than I care to acknowledge. Also, the 'lock out' feature never functioned properly for me. Again, far more times than I'd care to admit, I'd open my bag and see it glowing away merrily, wasting precious battery life. I would have returned it if the batteries hadn't exploded and fried its internals. I recommend something with a mechanical switch.   Chromedome is pretty clutch, but for the first 700 miles you really don't need a rain jacket if you have an umbrella. A wind shirt (I used the mont bell tachyon) in combination with the umbrella works just fine in the dry climate if it starts to rain. As long as you have something warm and dry to get into, you'll be fine. Rain skirt, too, could be sent to Kennedy Meadows without much concern.   A towel seems like a luxury to me if you're carrying a Buff, too. I'd swap that for another pair or two of socks (which you will definitely need).  In terms of 'dry bags,' everything inside your pack can just go in a trash compactor bag. They're cheap and extremely effective. Plus, they can be used as foot-covers for your sleeping bag in damp conditions to keep the condensation on the inside of your tent from wicking onto your sleeping bag (though the igneo should stave some of that off).  Generally, though, I'll echo the sentiments of the other posters and say that you've definitely done your homework and are in great shape with what you have right now. Whatever keeps you going will ultimately turn out to not be a 'luxury' item. I hiked with mini-binoculars so I could glass all the birds and other critters along the way, and had a suntactics scharger 5 to power up my toys. Food, footwear and rest are paramount. Happy trails!"
Ultralight,3a16u0,Simco_,4,Wed Jul 15 02:23:59 2015 UTC,"First, I would post this to /r/PacificCrestTrail  if I were you since it'll target more people who have experience with that trail.  The big 3 and the Jetboil are the biggest culprits, but you're looking at quite a bit of money to replace all of them.  I assume you'd have until at least next year to get it all, though."
Ultralight,3a16u0,Randyraycyrus,2,Tue Jun 16 14:32:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I'll post it there as well. Maybe wait until I have had a chance to update it first to not be spamming both groups.  I haven't yet bought any of the big three - will be updating all my current (old and very heavy) gear soon to use this summer and on the PCT next year, so very open to advice on alternative options."
Ultralight,3a16u0,Ping_Pong17,4,Tue Jun 16 19:11:24 2015 UTC,"Aside from the pricey big items, do you need the umbrella and rain jacket? If you left the umbrella you'd lose half a pound.   But really 15lbs isn't bad, and as you move along you will start deciding which things you really need and which ones can be sent home. Good luck have fun"
Ultralight,3a16u0,murphyw_xyzzy,8,Tue Jun 16 17:23:57 2015 UTC,"My umbrella in the desert was an absolute life saver. Provided shade while I hiked in exposed hot areas. Clipped it to my pack with two of these for hands free hiking. Probably one of my favorite pieces of gear I hiked with.   That being said, I shipped it north for the rains in Washington. After the desert and didn't carry it for The Sierra, northern Cali, or Oregon (although the year I hiked there was a heat wave in northern cali and I probably could have used it)."
Ultralight,3a16u0,Randyraycyrus,4,Tue Jun 16 18:48:48 2015 UTC,"About 1/3 of the time my umbrella rode indifferently my pack. Another third of the time I thought it was dumb and a waste. The latest third of the time it was so good I could compose songs about it.   I'll put up with the dumb and indifferent days in exchange for the days when it is 110 and I brought my own shade. Those days there are hikers crawling under rocks looking for shade. Feels pretty not-dumb to have my umbrella those days.   That said, it might ship home from kmed. From there till you're north enough to get lots of rain, I could get along without it. And having taken two poles and an ice axe and an umbrella through the sierras had me counting my arms and cursing for bringing too much."
Ultralight,3a16u0,kid775,3,Wed Jun 17 02:31:27 2015 UTC,"As /u/ping_pong17 said, the umbrella is primarily for sun and UV protection in the desert, so may end up ditching it at mile 700 or shipping it north for Washington. Cheers for the feedback!"
Ultralight,3a16u0,dmnsavage,2,Tue Jun 16 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"Right on, sounds like a good plan"
Ultralight,3a16u0,kid775,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:32:01 2015 UTC,"I was thinking that maybe you can even use your rain jacket and some other ninjaism and just rig it on to your backpack to go over your head to provide some shade? That's what I would do, because well, I'm cheap."
Ultralight,3a16u0,outdoor_md,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:31:38 2015 UTC,"Save the rain jacket for rain! The UV will prematurely wear out the rain jacket in the desert, when it really isn't needed anyhow."
Ultralight,3a16u0,mustbeaguy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:50:45 2015 UTC,Good to know. I remain suspicious towards the umbrella.
Ultralight,3a16u0,Thexorretor,3,Wed Jul 15 02:23:36 2015 UTC,"I hiked in 201. As Ping_Pong notes your gear list doesn't look too bad.  Things that stick out are the Jet Boil, the Big Three, your Luxury items, and battery pack.  Alcohol stoves are lighter if used for shorter trips. At a certain point (around 4 days for me) the weight of fuel makes the alcohol stove heavier than the Jet Boil. If you plan on rehydrating a lot of food or making hot drinks I would stick with the Jet Boil. If not, consider an alcohol stove.  The big three are heavy for true ultra light but are not out of line for hiking the PCT. It would be a pain/expensive to get these down. I personally cut my mat down but that might be excessive for you. Either way it is an easy modification to make while on the trail.  That camera is heavy. Are you a huge photographer or just someone who likes to take photos? If you are the latter I would reconsider taking that camera and opt for something smaller....like your cellphone camera as you are already bringing that.  Do you need that battery pack? What is it for? You already have usb cords and what not to charge your gear.  I personally thought I would read on the PCT and ended up not reading at all. If you are traveling by yourself/leaving at a date when there won't be many other hikers I would bring the kindle. If you are going to be in a pack of people (Leaving kick-off weekend through mid may from the south) I would not bring your kindle. If you are really dying for books, towns like Idyllwild (170ish miles in from the South) have plenty of used book stores.  Repeating Ping_Pong again but your pack is light for the start of the PCT compared to others. When I started I didn't even know what a base weight for a pack was. I was probably at 30 ish pounds. I got smarter really quickly and finished in 4 months.  Best of luck to you. Have fun out there!"
Ultralight,3a16u0,Thexorretor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:36:09 2015 UTC,"The issue with alcohol stoves is that they may be banned in a few of the California sections, where gas stoves are allowed. I already have a jetboil and the efficiency and ease compared to the Pocket Rocket for example make it worth the extra couple of grams for me.  I haven't bought any of the big three I'll use on the PCT yet - will be updating all my current (old and heavy) kit this summer, so very open to advice on alternative options.  Yeah the camera. I am still not certain about taking it, but I know I would be annoyed not to have it when I'm out there. Its something I could always send home if I find I'm not using it enough to warrant the extra 800 grams.  The battery pack is just a general usb power source to keep the phone working, and also the kindle and camera. They have a very useful torch built in for general use as well. Can probably save 100 grams by taking a smaller capacity one if I need the weight saving. Did you find just charging in towns was enough to keep things working?  Very interesting comment on reading. I am planning to start far earlier than most - April 10th ish, so maybe it is best to bring it. Can always send it home if I am not using it.  I did a decent amount of looking at other peoples PCT kit lists, so had a lot of people to copy in putting a list together. What base weight do you reckon you were at by the end, and what did you get really wrong in bringing?  Thanks so much for the feedback! Can't wait to get to the border - next April seems such long away and so far away from London at the moment!"
Ultralight,3a16u0,mustbeaguy,2,Tue Jun 16 19:20:13 2015 UTC,I've been on the fence about a jetboil vs a MicroRocket + titanium pot. Can you expand on why you made the jetboil decision?
Ultralight,3a16u0,Thexorretor,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:07:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't owned my Jetboil (I have the Sol Titanium one) that long, but here were my main reasons.  For me its mainly about ease of use and reliability. For sure, the Jetboil is the more expensive option and slightly heavier, but its effortless.  On the trail I typically only want to boil water for hot drinks or for a pasta style meal, not proper cooking. I can get the jetboil out of the bag, and have it set up and burning in 20 seconds. The burner, stand, cup lid and gas cylinder all pack away inside the pot, which is super convenient and also adds protection in your pack. This is not only protecting the stove, but stops your other things from getting sooty or stained.  Having it all pack away inside itself is good as well for non hiking things - I'm off to Glastonbury festival next week, and wouldn't dream of taking a normal stove, but will probably throw the jetboil in the bag for a morning brew just because its no extra effort.  Also the name gives it all away. These things boil ridiculously quickly. Like crazy fast. And typically you don't need to worry about a wind break as you would with a MSR style system.  Hope this helps - The best thing to do would be to see if a camping store will let you get a few different stoves out and have a play with them, or borrow friends units for a day or so to see for yourself which suits you. I would have absolutely no qualms about recommending the jetboil though."
Ultralight,3a16u0,AussieEquiv,2,Tue Jun 16 20:23:45 2015 UTC,"The kindle app works well. I've read several books on my phone. The circuit is a classic choice, but in my opinion too big for most of the trail (but too small for the high sierras with the extra clothes, bear canisterz, food)."
Ultralight,3a2v7t,ultralightdude,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:12:38 2015 UTC,"looks really good.  no rain jacket? houdini is fine for light rain, but for a heavy rainstorm or continuous rain you'll be soaked. 2 t shirts?  if it were me, i'd skip the extra undies, the xtra tshirt, skip the soap, skip the sunscreen, skip the bug dope, skip the plastic cup, skip the second pot that comes with the cookset.  plenty of water on the sht, so might ditch one of the extra water storage bags, your call.  i just bring a cookpot- no cup or second pot needed. i eat out of the cookpot.  i always bring a warm hat on every trip.  what are the safety glasses for?"
Ultralight,3a2v7t,throwawaypf2015,4,Tue Jun 16 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"skip the sunscreen   With you on most of the advice, but this one could backfire. Not worth getting sunburn."
Ultralight,3a2v7t,kungfulkoder,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:53:09 2015 UTC,"Fun little experiment from today: I put on the Houdini and went into the shower for 5 minutes.  Stayed dry where the Houdini was covering.  Not too shabby.  That being said, maybe an Umbrella is in order for the downpours.  I wish Go-Lite was still around for that.  Do you, or anyone else, know where the next best ultralight umbrella option is out there these days?  I've been considering ditching one of the water storage bottles, but who knows how dry the conditions will be when we go.  The cup is more for making sure the right amount of water goes into rehydrating.  It wasn't there until late today, and was added at the last second for cooking purposes.  I have this hat in yellow.  It's down, warm, and my wife makes fun of me for it.  i love it anyways.  I may bring it just in case.  The safety glasses are actually tinted as sunglasses.  They are light, shaded as sunglasses are supposed to be, and most importantly, cheap.  Thank you for your feedback!"
Ultralight,3a2v7t,AussieEquiv,2,Wed Jun 17 00:35:13 2015 UTC,I added Reverse-volume marks to my water carrier. Sharpie lines on it. So I can easily tell just how much water I'm pouring out.
Ultralight,3a2v7t,shut_the_fuck_up_don,2,Wed Jun 17 02:51:55 2015 UTC,"I have that same cook set (mine comes in at 5.5 oz on the scale though), and I always bring the pot and cup. I like having the cup for a warm drink in the morning or at night and having a warm meal at the same time. It's worth the 2 oz. Also, bring the sunscreen."
Ultralight,3a2v7t,laughter95,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:46:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the same umbrella. If you need one now in silver, I think anti gravity gear has one Swing Liteflex left in stock. Looks like all other retailers are still oos. I just bought mine from them. Otherwise if you order directly from the company, Euroschirm, it's a little more expensive. Campmor had them for the lowest price but have been oos in silver."
Ultralight,3a2v7t,laughter95,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:40:49 2015 UTC,"Idk if you already bought the poles but if you can buy the old version over the new, do it. Not only will they be like half the cost of the new but I think their grips are nicer to hold as they don't have the ridges of the new poles.   Are you cool with not being able to adjust the height of your pitch? Otherwise BD sells the adjustable version, BD Distance Carbon FLZ. $125 at backcountry edge. They're expensive but nice to use! Although the straps already started to fray after 10 miles of use, it's really not a big deal. They already sent me replacement straps and backcountry edge is willing to take the poles back for a refund or return, up to one year from purchase.  I find plastic bottles are more convenient to use and fill than soft sided bottles, also prefer the peace of mind that they're not going to break. Personal preference.  Probably should add a water scoop. Like a deer park bottle cut in half, take the bottom half."
Ultralight,3a2v7t,slothsnraptors,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:39:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  I'm lucky in that my poles are the exact height needed for both me, and my tent.  Any taller or shorter, and it might be awkward.  I have looked at the adjustable version, but having already bought these, I couldn't justify the expense when these poles work so well.  As for their use, they have been up and down about 25 14ers, and they are still in great shape.    I am also looking at the plastic bottles for convenience.  I think that using extra strong Velcro (or maybe one-way, and sticky Velcro to the bottle?), I could add two simple bottle holders to my shoulder straps for solid bottles.  I very well could post pictures of this addition in the next couple of days.  I also forgot the dirty water bottle for taking water in for the filter.  Adding now."

I store the tent, pole and stakes all in the stuff sack that the tent comes with. I then put the bottom of the tent in the left hand water bottle pocket of my pack and slip the top end under some of the side compression straps. I also wedge my Thermarest Z-Seat in that same pocket, which fills it out pretty nice.  I've never had a problem with this set up, tent doesn't come loose even when I have the pack open and I'm digging around in it. I would recommend being gentle when tightening the compression straps if you go this route. I doubt you'd actually break a pole or anything, but I try to hold the strap off of the tent bag when tightening so I don't slowly abrade the fabric.  I wouldn't get into removing the end support poles. I think they come out, but it's always seemed like such a hassle that I haven't bothered. And, honestly, they give you a nice solid shape to roll the tent fabric around when packing - no more kneeling on the wet ground to fold up a wet tent, you can do it standing!"
Ultralight,39y44v,Mambo_5,5,Mon Jun 15 19:08:31 2015 UTC,"You're base weight is the more important number: 13.5 pounds. That's not too bad. In your consumables, you list 3 liters of waters which is bit much for the Adirondacks. Plenty of water there. My default water carry is 2 liters, with less if I know I can find water along the way.  You could knock the number down a few pounds by getting the 1 pound equivalent of the base three (tent,sleeping bag/quilt, backpack) but that would be expensive.  I would also leave the bear mace (just a single baby has been killed by a black bear in new york in the last 100 years.) It's more likely to explode inside your car on I-87 and cause you to drive head on into a tractor-trailer.  The eTrex is unnecessary. You have map, compass, iPhone GPS, and another GPS in a highly trafficked area. I don't know exactly which mountains you'll do, but Mt. Marcy is a well worn trail. Not saying it's crazy to carry a GPS, but more of a techno gimmick.   Furthermore, the ursack is designed to be tied to a tree branch, not slung up as a bear hang. No p-cord needed for it."
Ultralight,39y44v,Thexorretor,2,Mon Jun 15 21:12:06 2015 UTC,"3 liters isn't too much if you're doing a Great Range Traverse.  It really depends on the itinerary.  For shorter trips of 1-3 peaks, then yes, 3 liters is probably too much.  Ursacks are not approved for use in the Eastern High Peaks, and you can be fined for using them.  You need an approved Bear Canister."

As for a good hike, you can hike into one of the lean-tos not too far from the garden parking area (about 3 miles) in Keene Valley and set up a base camp. Tons of great hikes to go on from there. Marcy, Little Haystack, Basin, Saddleback, Gothics, Armstrong, Lower Wolf Jaw, Upper Wolf Jaw, Yard and Big Slide are all right there.   Oh, and like a few other people have said, the Daks are generally wet. Carrying 1 liter of water is usually enough because the trail is next to/in a stream.

I agree, that there are a lot of differences and nuances between factories in China, after all, they are over a  billion people. Maybe I should've phrased my concern more focusing on the working conditions at that specific location. For example I own a phone that was manufactured in China, but parts of the profits go into a social fund and the workers are paid a fair wage. I think that's a good idea and a step in the right direction. That's for example something I would like to see at this project as well. And yeah, I also try to make local made products my first choice, but that's just not always possible."
Ultralight,3a1wzs,laughter95,5,Mon Jun 29 07:33:37 2015 UTC,Perhaps you could compare your product to some of the brands that are popular in the ultralight community? I'd say the most common brand I see on gear lists in ExOfficio. I'd also suggest that ultralight folks one of the most important features is how fast the fabric dries...because many of us end up handwashing boxers and air drying them during our adventures.
Ultralight,3a1wzs,Captin_Obvious,3,Thu Jun 18 08:56:51 2015 UTC,"once i bought calvin klein's micro modal boxer briefs. the fabric is really soft and very stretchy. they pilled and rode up. they also absorbed sweat very readily, but they didn't dry very quickly. i can't imagine this guy's (or tommy john's) modal to be nearly as quick-drying as ex-officio. definitely, the ex officio fabric is not nearly as buttery soft as modal, and while rare, it is actually possible to get sack chafe while hiking with ex officio boxer briefs. you are probably least likely to get any chafing with modal, which very easily sits next to skin. but part of that is because it's very thin. so anyways, i'm not sure that it would be as super-long lasting as ex officio, nor would it dry nearly as quickly as ex officio.  appears that reddit is a tough crowd. it's tough to penetrate this market, OP. there are tons of options out there already, and i think the vast majority of people would prefer to feel the fabric and check the fit instead of buying sight-unseen. i only did that with exofficio because the entire western world was proclaiming that it was one of those buy-it-for-life, best possible technical underwear available for use in everyday and outdoor situations."

You have the intensity of the hike, the duration of the hike (each day), the duration of the hike (total), the weight on your feet, the weight on your back, your weight, your fitness level, etc. I'm getting closer to getting it ""right"" but it's still not perfect.  One thing I missed for the first few times: It takes about 2-3 days for my appetite to match my energy requirements. I was invariably bringing too much food for the first few days. It's just dead weight.   For argument's sake, if my base calorie needs are 2,500 a day, and on a hike I'm using 5,000 calories per day, I will only be able to consume the full amount starting on day 3.  Day 1 and Day 2 I will need to force myself to eat to get above 3,000. I force myself the last bits, since I'm still using the energy.  By Day 3, my hunger usually matches my energy needs. This 5,000 calorie ""hunger"" will last ~2 days after the hike has ended (but luckily, you don't need to pack for that)."

It is also possible the odds of a spring being contaminated with giardia or some other microorganism is low enough that the risk is relatively negligible.  I own a few outdoors books from decades past and up until recently water drawn from the source of the spring was considered safe to drink without boiling or treatment of any kind.

Looking back, I misspoke in assuming there wasn't food grade bleach. I imagine food grade bleaches would still be rinsed off after long enough wet contact time for sanitation, because bleach salts can rust metal equipment. At the very least I imagine bleach would be fairly damaging on a person's microbial biome. It'd be cool to see a study on it."

Ultralight,39qmjr,summiter,2,Sun Jun 14 04:20:44 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, that just does not seem to be my experience.  I use reflectix as a pot cozy...I can hold a hot Ti pot (in the cozy) in my hand with water at almost boiling temperature.  And it definitely helps to retain heat in the pot.  Also, the ""reflecting"" may contribute to heat retention without affecting R value.  (To be honest, I don't really know how R value is calculated).  An R value of 0.125 seems so...small.   Edit: thanks for the links. I notice that the reflectix web site has a bunch of info on R values and reflectivity."
Ultralight,39qmjr,7629,7,Sun Jun 14 05:18:32 2015 UTC,"R-Values are tricky.  They're not linear, they are affected by all the forms of energy heat loss and everyone's experience is subjective.  But at the minimum, let's take a look at the construction and materials...  Reflectix is air-filled bubble wrap sandwiched between two thin mylar sheets.  As a [rough] comparison, the Therma-a-Rest neoAir has air-filled chamber(s) sandwiched between 7-denier* fabric.  The NeoAir is 2.5"" thick and rated at 3.2 R-Value.  The Reflectix is 1/8"" so if we take the properties of a commercial air pad and scale down we're looking at an estimated R-Value for Reflectix of 0.16.  But again, R-Values are not linear...  Someone with a degree in thermal somethingorother can fact-check me.    So then the question comes up about the Mylar reflectivity and how much R-Value that provides.  Now, realize Mylar reflects radiation but does not insulate.  Without an airspace between your body and the pad there is no radiation - that is, all energy is in the form of conduction.  The reason the Therm-a-Rest XTherm is so fucking awesome** is because the reflective surfaces are internal and the baffling creates an airspace between the outer fabric.  If you laid something like the Klymit Inertia over Reflectix you'd benefit from the reflective Mylar.   I think 7-denier, maybe 14 ** Best winter investment I've made   EDIT:  I should add the convection factor on the pad thickness.  In a 2.5"" pad there is ~2.5"" of airspace in which to mix the brutally cold ground air and relatively comfortable butt-warm air.  In a 1/8"" pad, provided my boney butt doesn't touch the ground to begin with, I only have a sliver of airspace for this epic battle of WARM v. COLD to duke it out.  The thermal gradient is very tight."

Your (excellent!) analysis seems to suggest that if I put the Xlite on top of the Reflectix (to create an airspace), then the R value will indeed be bumped up.  I'll just add a piece big enough to fit under my ""core.""  The only question now:  Will the increase in R value be enough to justify the added weight?  Again, thanks for the analysis."

I've slept in it in a tent, on a pad in below 50 degree weather, I only wore boxers and socks but if I wasn't so drunk I probably would have been pretty cold. BUT if you wear long underwear, thick wool socks, a skull cap and a sweater or Hoodie you could easily take that down to the low 30's. Not only is this system cheaper, it is also much lighter, more versatile, and more packable. As far as warmth goes, 5 lbs of could lot he's that hug your skin will go a lot further than 5 lbs of sleeping bag. Plus a clothes based system is more versatile because you can layer the items and use them in multiple circumstances. Also they are easier to clean and maintain.

Ultralight,39qmjr,rafiki530,0,Sun Jun 14 10:51:06 2015 UTC,That's just stupid. I'm guessing you've never used an alcohol stove in the wind. It's not a candle that blows out in the slightest breeze.
Ultralight,39qmjr,mrjowee,1 point,Sun Jun 14 07:03:50 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for him but I wouldn't consider 30mph winds to be a ""slight breeze"". The problem with wind isn't the stove going out, it's with the flame reaching and or heating the pot you are using to cook with which is why you carry a windscreen for your stove. Alcohol stoves in general, are made for high altitude and cold temperatures, gas stoves are so small and portable that I really don't see the savings in weight/space. But that's just my opinion.   EDIT: Your stove can also blow over in winds, which would spill liquid fuel all over the place possibly burning you, your equipment, or the forest."
Ultralight,39qmjr,rafiki530,2,Sun Jun 14 14:53:12 2015 UTC,"gas stoves are so small and portable that I really don't see the savings in weight/space. But that's just my opinion.   Then your opinion is wrong, because it's a fact that alcohol stoves are smaller and lighter.   More on point, I don't see his stove use is hindered by using a hammock. If it's really so windy that my stove can be blown over (which anyone who has used al alcohol stove knows is pretty ridiculous) I could probably set up my tarp low enough to tough the ground. If someone is using a tent, they're not going to cook in the vestibule. Or are animals of no concern?"
Ultralight,39qmjr,mrjowee,1 point,Sun Jun 14 21:02:10 2015 UTC,"I'm referring to things like This vs this   Gas stove + canister vs. alcohol stove + whatever your carrying your alcohol in. space is about the same and the weight difference is minimal, I can boil my water much quicker, turn off the flame quickly, and if for some reason my stove gets knocked over by say the pot getting kicked I'm not going to have a bunch of fuel ignite all over the place. Not to mention pouring in to much alcohol or having some on your hands when you light it, I only use alcohol stoves when I have to and I certainly don't use those ""penny"" stoves after seeing first hand what can go wrong with them.   I don't see a lot of difference except one uses a more unstable fuel source which is harder to control. In both situations you need a wind screen for wind regardless of the stove you use when there is wind, both alcohol stoves and gas are subject to being put out in strong wind."
Ultralight,39qmjr,steveflinn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:53:57 2015 UTC,"the weight difference is minimal   Depends a lot on how far you're going.   That canister set up is 11.2 oz, including fuel.   The Mini Trangia and included windscreen are 5.7oz., and this is hardly the lightest option out there. Add an ounce for a Vargo fuel bottle. I burn through about 1/2oz per meal.   The alcohol stove is 4.5oz lighter, so to equal them out I'd have enough fuel for 9 days. So the weight advantage goes to the alcohol stove until you're out for 10 days or more. My usually trips include only two cooked meals. 7.7oz for the stove, wind screen, and fuel.  If I was in a rush, I wouldn't be backpacking.  The flame snuff out as quickly as I can toss the flame snuffer onto the stove. I've never knocked over this stove. If I did, I'd imagine that a 1/2oz of alcohol (a tablespoon) would burn out pretty damn quickly and hardly be a disaster. I don't think it's possible to pour in too much fuel. The size of the cooking flame is the same no matter if the stove is completely filled or about to run out. The trangia allows fuel to be stored in the stove rather than cautiously poured back into the bottle. The fact that it can be snuffed out, fuel can be stored in it, and the pot, lid, wind screen, and dove all work as a system is why I use the slightly heavier Mini Trangia over other alcohol stoves (11.3oz, not including fuel).  Oh, and I used my alcohol stove below sea level for about a week. So there's that.  I'm still curious as to why hammocks were brought into the conversation."

Ultralight,39koz6,HyperliteMGear,2,Fri Jun 12 12:01:52 2015 UTC,"The narrative that I've heard on cuben fiber is that it's more fragile and puncture-prone than other UL fabrics. No personal experience with it, but from playing with cuben fiber products it seems like a reasonable assertion. If someone was to plot the various shelter fabrics on a graph, I would expect cuben fiber to be an outlier with respect to cost vs weight/durability.  But maybe prices will come down as it becomes a more prominent fabric, or maybe people will start experimenting with coated cuben fiber - an ultra-thin layer of urea would be a nice touch."

Ultralight,39koz6,anything_here,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:04:00 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, are you willing to share why you predict that?   Mostly from watching the market over the last few years.  CTC (Cuben Tech Corp) is a pretty small company with very few employees, trying to supply a massively growing industry. Over the last two seasons we have seen every manufacturer that uses CF facing issues of backorders from CTC.  We have already seen prices increase on many of the higher end CF hiking products. Mostly it has been small percentages here and there, but also a few times $100+ here and there.  These companies are having to place larger and larger orders in order to attempt to keep the fabric in stock. This results in massive Purchase Orders and up-front-money being put out by the cottage makers. And, because they are all being forced to do this now, it is making it even harder and harder for CTC to keep up with the orders on their end of things.  Anyway, as I said, it is just a prediction... but it seems like CTC is in a tough spot, and they own the market, so if they want to grow and be able to keep up with orders, it stands to reason that they will have to build more manufacturing on their end of things... and that is probably going to mean their product price will go up in order to pay off the bank loan they would likely have to get.  Unlike, I am guessing here... Unlike big box stores that can just throw money at a new location to keep prices down, these small cottage companies (be it CTC/MLD/ZPacks/SMD/etc) are usually forced to increase prices, no lower prices in order to grow from one stage to another... and... well, my guess, my prediction... is that CTC is now at that point where they are going to have to start throwing lots of money at expansion in order to keep up with the demands... and that will trickle down the ladder to the end-customer.

Ultralight,39koz6,abela,1 point,Tue Jun 16 00:56:27 2015 UTC,"Actually, the strength of cuben fiber totally depends on what type you get. Not all cuben fiber is created equally. Cuben Fiber has gotten a bad rap because some companies use the lightest possible CF fabric available. We don't use the lightest fabric available because we want our products to be durable. I'm going to work on a blog post that explains this in more detail. If you are interested I can send you some samples of our materials, and you can try your hardest to puncture them. WIth our CF11, you can put a tear in it with a knife, but you won't be able to rip that tear further with just your hand strength. Send me an email and your address to lizzy@hyperlitemountaingear.com, and I'll send you some scraps of material."

I've used that thing everyday since for commuting, hiking, biking and climbing. It is a fantastic pack. Probably the best I've ever owned.   Some key feedback if you're interested:   The polyester face is remarkably abrasion resistant. Love the reinforced bottom. The pack loads well - up to around 28kg is my limit, remarkable for what the pack is. Your sizing chart works well. The Y strap over the top is a great feature for stowing bulky items (ccf mats, rope, duffel bag etc) Would love it if the top pocket was removable. Its a great size for all my key bits, but sometimes gets in the way. Also, can be difficult to get things out of when the pack and top pocket are FULL. Would be cool if the clips for the ice axe heads had one reversed buckle, so they could clip together forming a larger strap."

Ultralight,39lhyw,shuddertostink,5,Fri Jun 12 17:26:46 2015 UTC,"Always do your homework. Steep and Cheep is basically a dumping ground for items from Backcountry.com.       Normally the items listed are last-season, off colors, or off sizes. Not always.      You likely won't find cheaper deals on these items other places, but sometimes equivalent prices (because other sites are also going to have these items discounted). the % off number is skewed because it's unlikely anyone is going to pay full retail for these items any longer.      The benefit is that often 'last season' is just as good or exactly the same as a brands current offering. Colors are sometimes the only thing that changes. You just have to research to know if the up-to-date model has a feature that you really like, which would make paying slightly more for the current version worthwhile.      SAC tries to trick you with the countdown. They encourage impulse buying which hinders research. That's why I don't like it. I was addicted for a long time. Know what you 'need' and wait for it to show up. If you watch that site all-day every-day you are guaranteed to buy some shit you don't need. That's how they get you."

Other brands I've seen using leather linings are Scarpa and Asolo (specifically the 535).   If the terrain is manageable, then as the others have said trail runners are probably your best bet.

They don't have enough padding for extended walks on hard/packed surfaces, offer no support, and force you to walk on the front of your foot - heel striking isn't good for you, but these things will murder your foot and ankle if you do, and generally cause foot discomfort if worn too much consecutively because of the enforced gait and lack of padding.  I will say a dayhike I took in them had an inordinate amount of muck, and they were surprisingly pleasant/non-foot-destructive when wet and dried quickly.   I do use them for being light and small when travelling, nothing like being able to stuff a second pair of shoes into your luggage for variety/in case your bulky pair gets wet, in less volume than a pair of pants."

I was half asleep but in a dream phase of consciousness. I had to take the biggest piss of my life but did not want to get out of my tent. So me being half awake, I started designing your pee tube in my head and how I was going to fully integrate it into my tent wall through a grommet hole for future hikes. I literally thought about this idea for like 3 hours and was convinced that I was a genius and that I was about to change the backpacking world with this invention. Later on in the morning, I was confused as to why i thought I was so brilliant in the middle of the night. It sounds like we should collaborate on some aftermarket pee tube kits"
Ultralight,398mwe,laughter95,6,Thu Jun 11 07:27:38 2015 UTC,"now how about a poop strategy?   i wake up at like 3:45am, feeling shitty, realizing i probably need to shit. then i try to fall asleep for the next 30 mins, then give up and finally get out of my tent to go find a shitty area.   then it's like 10-15 mins of digging the fucking hole, maybe tons of mosquitoes around me. then i have to take off my pants completely, do the shit, then cover up. then walk back. if i am in an overused area, i am looking for someone else's shit so I don't step on it, or dig it up.   that whole ordeal took me 45 mins just to shit.   next day i feel so shitty because i had poor sleep."

Ultralight,398mwe,laughter95,2,Wed Jun 10 02:04:42 2015 UTC,i complained about this to my friend today. she suggested the same. she also suggested that i sling up a mosquito canopy over my hole.   i will try the future hole strategy this weekend.  only problem is that this hole is sorely wasted if you end up not needing to go at all.
Ultralight,398mwe,RockyShea,7,Wed Jun 10 03:04:09 2015 UTC,Just put up a sign and pass it on to the next hiker. Put your name on the sign so they know who to thank for the handiwork!

Ultralight,398mwe,IncendiaryGames,2,Wed Jun 10 04:21:20 2015 UTC,I dig the hole before it gets dark the night before.

Ultralight,398mwe,lo_dolly_lolita,6,Wed Jun 10 01:31:45 2015 UTC,"Eh, I doubt it, predators will avoid a site if you pee around the perimeter or so I've heard. I think deer or similar animals might be attracted to it because of the salt, but I don't see those neurotic fuckers coming into an occupied campsite.   And it's just pee. It's not like I'm advocating dropping a deuce in the middle of the fire ring.   As for future visitors, I am a big proponent of camping off trail in a non established campsite not visible from the trail. Chances are no one has ever camped there and never will again. IMO it's the true LNT way to camp."
Ultralight,398mwe,SherpaLali,4,Wed Jun 10 01:48:07 2015 UTC,"Camping at a site where you are not upsetting any vegetation will always be a little less destructive than even a responsible non established camp, because good use at an established campsite will leave it perfectly unchanged. This is nearly impossible in most natural areas. I camp at non established sites occasionally (if they aren't fragile) because it's an awesome experience, but I recognize that it has an impact, even if it's a slight one."
Ultralight,398mwe,m0untaingoat,2,Wed Jun 10 01:49:46 2015 UTC,"I suppose if you're camping in some super fragile tundra or something I can understand your position. But most of my camping is done in dense temperate forest. The spot where I put my groundcloth recovers before I have lunch the following day, I assure you. And in a few days time even CSI Miami wouldn't be able to tell I had ever been there.   Here are other benefits of camping in a non established site as well, the biggest being you almost don't have to worry about bears or rodents visiting your site at all. If you don't cook, or build a fire (which I never do) there is absoutley no reason to worry about hanging food. Which I absoutley despise."
Ultralight,398mwe,tikcuf12,3,Wed Jun 10 01:59:09 2015 UTC,"might attract unwanted visitors   In Australia at least, generally opposite is true. A bit of piss around the campsite informs all the scent based animals that you're in the area and no one gets surprised and startled. Doesn't really scare anything away, maybe some things take a b-line around camp instead of straight through."

Once you're done you can just put a snowball over the hole you created to cover any smells. You can hassle-free piss without even getting out of your bag!"
Ultralight,398mwe,mvmntsofthemind,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"As others said, I buy a large Gatorade bottle empty it and rinse with rubbing alcohol (to prevent Gatorade pee smell while using).  When using, I lay on my side so the bottle can be mostly vertical. It's worked like a charm for years with no spills. Remember though, you can't fill it more than 75 percent or you risk spilling.  It's an awesome luxury to sleep soundly after 5am"

I keep my Keen sandals placed appropriately where i swing out of the hammock. When i used to tent, it seemed a more difficult process and i would try various methods from the Gatorade bottle to (not my best moment) ziploc bags. Commercially available products probably work better, but i think the best solution would be just to learn to like getting out to pee at 3 am (turn that frown upside down! ). You can stare at the stars and see what your ancestors saw!  I like to pretend that if i spend a few minutes meditating/ruminating on various things (gunshots, hunting, agressiveness, general things that animals might fear) it might have an effect on the pheromones in my pee, scaring away unwanted nighttime visitors. I then proceed to set up a perimeter about 5 to 10 yards away. I haven't been pulled out of my hammock by a bear since i started this ritual!"

Ultralight,3975gw,rafikiswish,8,Tue Jun 9 19:10:19 2015 UTC,"Not a ton of overnight hikes in the 1-2 hour driving radius around the city - and the hikes that do exist are, in my experience, very crowded and overused.   A great place in the spring time is Henry W. Coe State Park, though it's probably getting pretty hot there by now. Big Sur is nice, but most of the trails are covered in poison oak. Tahoe and Desolation Wilderness are great, Mendocino Nat'l Forest and Snow Mountain Wilderness are great, too.   Trinity Alps is currently my favorite place to spend the night, but it's a good 5 hours from SF.   There's also /r/norcalhiking for inspiration.  What types of hikes are you looking for? How many miles, what kind of elevation gain, etc. What types of hikes are you used to?  Gear-wise: A 40° bag should be fine for almost anything. I rarely need rain gear in the summer, we don't get the daily thunderstorms like CO. Might be different this year though, May was pretty wet. Water should probably be treated, maybe less so in the High Sierra. Water will also be pretty difficult to come by on some trails by the end of August. Sometimes there are fire bans, so no wood or alcohol stoves or the like.    P.S. People make fun of people who say San Fran. Most people refer to it as SF, the City, or the Bay Area."
Ultralight,3975gw,r_syzygy,3,Tue Jun 9 20:15:16 2015 UTC,"lol, I'll avoid using San Fran, sure wouldn't want to get made fun of...  Thanks for the info, I'll have to check out those hikes.  I'll really only have weekends free, so i'm mostly looking at doing a couple overnighters during the summer, 20-30ish miles, nice views, loops or out and back would be nice so I can solo and not bother anyone to pick me up."
Ultralight,3975gw,emosapien,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:30:06 2015 UTC,"I live in Reno, can confirm Tahoe/Sierras as your best bet.   I have Bay area friends who do trips out to Tahoe just to ski for the day, so I would assume driving out here isn't too terrible.  If you do come up the hill, you might want to consider a slightly warmer bag. Lake Tahoe is approx 6500', if I remember correctly, and hiking around, hitting 8-11k feet isn't out of the ordinary and makes for a potentially chilly night."

Ultralight,3975gw,courageousmango,5,Sat Jun 20 17:07:59 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the Bay Area!   I'm from San Francisco as well and love it because of how close we are to many great places for hiking.   Point Reyes, Henry Coe,  and Big Basin (look up the Skyline to the Sea trail) are all relatively close and are large parks adequate for multi day trips.   As far as climate goes, it's fairly mild all year. More rain and somewhat colder in the winter months, with on average more sun and warmer days in the summer. The fog can tend to roll in quick (year round) and with it bring a drop in temperature along with some wind and heavy mist (a wind shirt is a great piece of gear to have).   During the summer I would say a 40* bag would most likely be fine as long as you checked the weather forecast. During the winter it definitely can get chilly, but of course there isn't really any snow. I usually pack a 30* EE quilt as it gives me flexibility with venting and combined with layers I can use it year round.   Will you freeze to death with a 40* quilt in the Bay Area? No, might you be a little uncomfortable if there was a cold snap? Sure, but there wouldn't be any danger."
Ultralight,3975gw,Thexorretor,3,Tue Jun 9 20:01:32 2015 UTC,"California is very dry during the summer. Rain is rare. You can get away with a lot if you check the weather just before you leave. The flip side, and especially this summer, is you need to be very fire conscious. Probably not worth having one except on a beach. No Mosquitoes are also pretty rare, but they do accumulate in astonishing proportions in Yosemite around this time of year. So, a simple tarp would work well.  The east side of the sierras falls dramatically to the desert floor. It's in a rain shadow and gets really cold at night. I've had 17 degree nights and 80 degree days. Down is your friend."
Ultralight,3975gw,blasphemybagels,2,Tue Jun 9 22:25:46 2015 UTC,"Close by, there's not so much for overnight hikes. You could hike the Ohlone Wilderness Trail.   For day hikes, I recommend these two websites for suggestions: http://gurmeet.net/hiking/ http://www.bahiker.com/"
Ultralight,3975gw,ElSinestro,2,Wed Jun 10 07:56:31 2015 UTC,"Here's a dumb idea I've been toying with. There's a ~32 mile hike you could do:  http://gurmeet.net/hiking/hikes/East_Bay_Skyline_National_Recreation_Trail.html  Each of the segments is pretty nice on its own, but what makes this one entertaining is that the third section (Sibley) has a campground very roughly in the middle, and you can take bart to either end. This turns it into a hilarious quasi-wilderness thru-hike you can get to via public transit. Some sections can feel remote, but I don't think you're ever more than a mile from civilization.  More seriously, there's a pretty good book which documents a couple of nice hikes:  http://www.amazon.com/One-Night-Wilderness-Convenient-Backpacking/dp/0899976239  Not in the book but in the same ballpark are Butano, Forest of Nisene Marks, and Pescadero Creek state parks."

I actually just bused over to Spencer Bus Pad then hiked in to Hawk. Need reservations for both but entirely free.   I went during the week and I had Hawk camp all to myself the first night which is great because there's only three campsites. I'd originally planned to stay there two nights but the rangers messed up my reservation. Thankfully there were spots open at Haypress which is more of a group campsite.   During the week these camps were pretty quiet. On the weekend though, oh shit everyone comes out. All the Marin beach lots are packed with families and day hikers/trail runners. There was a 30+ boy scout group that took over Haypress on thankfully they day I left.   A little further north is also Pantoll and and the less popular Bootjack.   Mt.

Like others have said, in the Bay Area, there aren't many, and what we do have gets crowded. If you want more wilderness and more seclusion, you'll have to go farther. The wider you open your radius, the more (awesome) options open up. Desolation Wilderness, Granite Chief Wilderness, Tahoe Nat'l Forest, Yuba River, Cache Creek Wilderness, Big Sur (holy poison oak, batman), Pt Reyes (gets busy), Henry Coe (in the spring), Trinity Alps, any section (or a thruhike) of the Tahoe Rim Trail (the NV side is gorgeous, but not a lot of water, I liked the Southern section, too)."
