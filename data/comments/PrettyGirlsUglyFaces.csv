PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,3aaj3t,SnideOctopus,7,Thu Jun 18 15:07:57 2015 UTC,"This is such an awesome app idea. Wish it was on Android. I gotta say though, the new design looks kinda ugly compared to the old one. Bubbles, shines, and that ""plastic"" look are fading out in the app world and most are moving on to flat, bold, sleek designs.  Nevertheless, good work!"
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,3aaj3t,SamFuchs,4,Thu Jun 18 18:27:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! From what we've observed, Android users (like yourself!) are much more used to/prefer sleeker designs, and iOS users still prefer the flashy one we've moved to here. Don't worry - once we move to Android, we'll make sure to match the industry standards in design. Thanks for commenting!"
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,3aaj3t,DrBob3002,2,Thu Jun 18 18:55:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for understanding. There's way too many developers out there who don't understand Android design philosophy and just copy paste their design.

I don't understand why people would make horrible assumptions about someone's body and say them to that person.... fucking internet, man. People forget that they are  talking to an actual person and act like cowards behind their anonymity. Most of you aren't adults, but at least try to act like one. Don't say anything to anyone online that you wouldn't say if the person was standing right in front of you. Make yo mamas proud.  I await the ""shut up, fatty"" and other clever and unique comebacks you all may have, hope you grow up soon.  OP, you're totally gorgeous and your brows are strong.

PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,36t35w,Professor_McBeetus,-1,Fri May 22 04:33:00 2015 UTC,Stating the truth is being an asshole?
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,36t35w,Professor_McBeetus,-11,Fri May 22 05:25:00 2015 UTC,"Tired of the double standard and excuses. If someone went on another girl's picture and said she was too skinny no one would care. Heaven forbid though someone points out that someone else is fat. If you're working towards getting in better shape and improving your life, that's great keep it up. But do not blatantly lie and pretend you're something that you're not."
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,36t35w,Professor_McBeetus,-12,Fri May 22 07:04:50 2015 UTC,"Yet which one is accepted? I'm not arguing that it's going to upset people. It is. The problem is, it sometimes is necessary. Too many people worry about hurting someone else's feelings and it's made us grow complacent. We should hold everyone to a certain standard in regards to their body, because it's important to be healthy. 2/3 of the US population is overweight does that not sound like a problem?"
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,36t35w,Fesuasda,-11,Fri May 22 17:26:07 2015 UTC,"You read too many biased articles. She's fat. End of discussion. No one is born fat. Yes people have different body types, for example I have very broad shoulders and a barrel chest. You mentioned that you have a thinner physique, that's normal. No one has a body type that is fat though, it is not biologically or physically possible for that to happen. Let me ask you, if you had the chance to date someone that is more physically fit or someone who is fat which would you choose? Ignore how they are as a person and focus strictly on physical characteristics. I guarantee you would choose the person that is more physically fit, because that is what as humans, we deem to be more suitable mates. It's science."
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,36t35w,canyeh,2,Fri May 22 17:40:27 2015 UTC,"You can tell someone they're overweight without being an ass hole. Also, if they're overweight, they already know it. Finally, it is absolutely not anyones job here to point it out. Shaming people behind a god damn keyboard is not where solving this problem you speak of starts. Not one person who fat shames on here would go up to someone in public and say ""wow you're really a little piggy""."
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,36t35w,WastingOurYouth,8,Fri May 22 17:47:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, stating truths can make someone an asshole. No contradiction there.  Some may argue that it's easier to be an asshole by saying blatant and unnecessary truths. (Not saying it is true in this case.)"

PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,36t35w,Professor_McBeetus,-2,Mon May 25 07:15:31 2015 UTC,"BMI sucks as a measuring tool. Too many variables are missing in the equation. It's easier and better to use this comparison site if you are curious. No, these women are not obese at 170lb.."
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,36t35w,Fesuasda,-2,Fri May 22 10:38:32 2015 UTC,exactly
PrettyGirlsUglyFaces,36t35w,mattychanbitch,6,Fri May 22 09:15:19 2015 UTC,BMI is actually quite accurate for the general population. It's really only abnormally high bone mineral densities or muscles that could throw it off. However muscle is about 25 percent denser than fat; so you'd have to have A LOT of muscle to throw off the calculation. At 25.5 you're not obese. But technically you are still overweight.
