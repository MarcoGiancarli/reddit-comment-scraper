I had initially put them back where they came from but their momma never came back.  So I ended up raising them. When they were fully feathered it was apparent that they're sparrows, not robins.  Two of the babies did end up dying about 9-10 days later.  I don't know what happened.  And this fat guy broke a foot learning to fly.  But he's happy, he flies extremely well now, and he finds his own food.  I still bring a few fresh berries and dried worms just in case, but he's totally independent now."

cute,32zo2c,DaOsoMan,1 point,Sat Apr 18 17:40:42 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it is because small children take off their pants a lot at the age of two. Especially when potty training.

She has gone through quite alot for only being 4yrs old, so we setup a YouTube channel to upload videos and pictures. Something to help us, her, and possibly other parents. Just maybe there are other parents that are expecting a child or have a child with a cleft lip/palate and we reach out and relate to them in some way.  ......Well, as I was going through all our photos, I realized how many pictures we have of her randomly napping. It was so cute and funny! And so for fun and practice, I made this little video montage or her! It always brings a smile to our faces when we watch it and hopefully yours as well! :)"
