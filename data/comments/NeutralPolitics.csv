The negative liberty (freedom from government action) is upheld in these cases, because the 14th Amendment prohibits government violation of the equal protection clause.  It is silent on whether there is a freedom on the part of a putative homosexual petitioner to be 'free from' a difference in treatment by a private entity, such as a business (unless explicitly handled by the anti-discrimination provisions in the Civil Rights Act, operating from 'protected classes'), or a membership organization (private clubs may indeed refuse membership for whatever reason they choose).

NeutralPolitics,3dyogs,JumboChimp,14,Mon Jul 20 18:04:20 2015 UTC,"I think something that wasn't mentioned enough in the debates about same-sex marriage is what marriage really is when you strip away the religious and romantic aspects: a civil contract between two consenting adults that defines each spouse's rights and responsibilities with regard to things like fidelity, community property, inheritance, custody and care of children (natural and adopted), and medical decisions in situations where one spouse is incapacitated.  The more hyperbolic slippery-slope arguments against same-sex marriage (what's next? people marrying an animal/a child/an inanimate object) are nonsense for the simple reason that those things cannot enter into contracts.  With regard to your first two bullet-pointed questions:  Since a marriage is a contract and minors cannot generally sign binding contracts, states can set a minimum age of 18.  Nebraska and Mississippi set the age at 19 and 21 respectively. All 50 states and DC allow minors to marry, though parental and/or judicial consent are required.  (Slightly non-neutral aside from a Massachusetts resident: what the hell Massachusetts?  Twelve year old girls can get married, but boys have to wait until they're 14?  I'm don't know if I'm more horrified that 12 year old girls can get married or that you make boys wait two more years.  Not cool Massachusetts.)  Polygamy and other forms of plural marriage were one of the other examples cited in the slippery slope arguments but I don't think it's as easy to argue that you have a right to multiple spouses as it is to marry someone of the same sex.  The marriage contract between a same sex couple is the same as the contract between and man and a woman and the rights and responsibilities each spouse has under that contract are unchanged by the fact that it's a same sex couple.  What would a plural marriage contract look like?  If a man has two wives, does he have one marriage to each, or does a single marriage contract exist between the three of them?  Is the marriage to the first wife considered senior to the marriage to the second?  If so, the second wife has fewer rights in her marriage than the first.  If not, the first wife's rights under her marriage contract were reduced by the second marriage.  One husband with two wives is pretty much the simplest plural marriage arrangement, but there could be marriages with any number of husbands with any number of wives.  There doesn't seem to be a way to either extend marriage to multiple partners without major changes to the law, or to claim that the right to plural marriage exists because it's something legally very different than marriage between two people."
NeutralPolitics,3dyogs,JumboChimp,6,Mon Jul 20 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"Supposing it were no different than joint ownership of property?    It is contractually possible to have two people consent to ownership shared, then a third entrant then a fourth, etc, all the while the first two owners may cede ownership, etc, and all parties are equally represented.    I don't see why the same couldn't be true for marriage.    After all, when Bob marries Sally, but then divorces and marries Francine, if Joe and Sally marry, Bob isn't party to it, just as Francine isn't either.    Seems to me that Bob and Sally and Francine could marry, and down the road, Bob could divorce one or both of them, either Sally or Francine staying, or both Sally and Francing having to sign the papers (much as divorces now do, up to an including court requirements to comply), and go get married to Joe, or those two go and marry Joe.    Handled like the property and financial contracts you're talking about, there's actually a great deal of well fleshed out contract law available for us to create for marriage or simply default to using if there was Federal/State nationally recognized polygamous marriage, just as same-sex marriage."

I'm not saying it can't or shouldn't be legal, rather that it will be difficult to claim any form of plural marriage as a right under equal protection or any other legal theory, and that formalizing plural marriage in a generalized form will be far more complicated than advocates acknowledge.    The argument in favor of same-sex marriage is straightforward: under the 14th amendment's equal protection clause, same sex couples should be able to enter into the same type of existing, standard, state-recognized marriage contract as opposite-sex couples, as the gender of the parties is not an essential part of those contracts.  Poly groups of any sort can get together and write their own marriage contracts if they wish (just as regular couples can, subject to the limits of state law, personalize their marriage contracts with a pre-nuptial agreement), but there is no existing standard, state-sanctioned contract comparable to any form of plural marriage that they are being denied access to, and hence no claim to a right to plural marriage under the 14th amendment."

Husband and Wife 1 have a contract, Husband and Wife 2 have a contract, but Wife 1 and 2 won't have one between them unless they choose to do so. Multiple parties can have a contract with a business without having any other relationship between each other. One party would also be advantaged in any breach of the contract (divorce, custody issues, etc) decided by seniority or their level of involvement/interest in the issue at hand. When a business goes bankrupt, seniority rules when 2 parties have equal debt to collect and the party with the most debt gets preference.  It could work but to would require a massive effort to rewrite marriage laws but it is possible.  That said, it would destroy any notion of ""marriage"" in law.

I'm actually one of those against Obergefell. I agreed with Roberts; marriage was a word defined as a union between a man and a woman in the United States since its beginning, and any changing of that definition would have to be done through the normal legislative process. I thought a much better outcome of the case would have been if the SCOTUS had mandated all states to offer civil unions.

As indicated in my response, the examples I cited were clearly absurd hyperbole that opponents of same-sex marriage cooked up for the press.  At the government level, civil unions vs. marriage, is a distinction without a difference.  As for 'marriage' the word, it's often tossed around as though the word's meaning remains unchanged since time immemorial, but that's not true.  Marriage has meant many different things throughout history, even within the relatively short history of this country.  But, here in the US, the Constitution nominally guarantees equal protection under the law, and there are sometimes surprising consequences of that.  Like, if you let a man and a woman enter into a standard, state-approved contract, you have to let a same-sex couple do the same.  You even have to let the same-sex couple call that contract by the same name the mixed-sex couple does:  Marriage.  I'd have agreed with you once.  I was opposed to Goodridge when that ruling came down, and wished the SJC had let the legislature catch up with the times through the normal legislative process. They started letting the gays marry in Our Fair City at 12:01am on my birthday in 2004, which was upsetting at the time.  Do you know how many times I've had to deal with gay marriage since then?  Zero.  Do you know how many times I've been aware of gay marriage in Massachusetts since then?  Zero.

Supporting polygamy in state, local and federal law would require a VAST rewrite of those laws, either to write in rules for polygamous unions or to eliminate references to monogamous unions at all and treat all relationships the same regardless of marital status.

As I understand it, there is law only to formally codify societal practice widespread enough and significant enough that dispute over conduct has some weight in the real world.  There's not much law written about when it's illegal to regift, for instance, because there are no consequences so serious or widespread that we need any framework outside of property law to address it.  Marriage, I think, is an outgrowth of a basic human desire for interpersonal union and perpetuity. That seems like it really does need good book keeping in a modern society."

I think the major moral opposition to allowing polygamy is that it would validate an institution that, throughout much of history, created a power structure where men ruled over their many wives. Wives were relegated to home- and babymaking, because that was a prime incentive for those relationships to exist in the first place.  Given that the state should have the best interest of its citizens in mind, especially those who are historically oppressed or disadvantaged, that presents a strong reason for staying away from polygamy/polyamory."

I think a better reason for the government being able to avoid this issue is that ""being polygamous"" is impossible to define. ""Being straight"" or ""being gay"" is easy to define, and promoting the rights of people in both classes to benefit from marriage is doable. This is not the case with polygamy, since there is no way to justify why you are discriminated against if you cannot marry two separate people. Marriage includes you the same as it does anyone else: you can marry one person at a time, and that's it."

If plural marriage were legal, there'd be nothing to stop a company's board of directors from all marrying each other, engaging in illegal acts, and, when it comes to light, oops, nobody who knows anything can be compelled to testify.  You could remove the privilege from everyone's marriage, or you could remove that privilege from plural marriages, but both of those solutions involve changing the privileges associated with marriages. Enabling same-sex couples to get married didn't do that: Opposite-sex couples still have precisely the same marriages they've always had, and same-sex couples now have precisely that kind of marriage as well."

This seems like a strange point to make but I've been curious to see if that statute would lead to roommates and friends getting ""married"" to skirt paying for insurance until they needed it.

There's a tendency in human nature to mistake attempts to explain a phenomenon with attempts to excuse or justify a phenomenon. You see this all the time, for example when it's pointed out that the military has a rape epidemic because young testosteronal males with no sexual outlet and limited female access in a hierarchical institution are going to do awful things when one or two hot young women join.

There's no doubt that the United States and Europe have far greater ties to the power structures in the Middle East than Russia has ever had, so to build connections between Russia and the ME would require a lot of time and effort that may not pay off. I could only see that happening if a catastrophic power shift occurred (I'm talking Arab Spring with A LOT more militant revolutionary movements) or if the U.S. and Europe began withdrawing its ties, which would probably imply that the Middle East isn't as profitable then which raises the issue of ""is it worth it?"" again for Russia."

I'd look for bases or anti-missile brigades mapped around Russia, as well as a few new NATO members rolled up onto their doorstep.

Russia is a nuclear power, for one.  So out-and-out war is unlikely.    Proxy wars, yes.  Again, its not worth going to war over in terms of what it would cost in human life, much like when tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia under Khrushchev and the USSR.  The US and the west's policy has been to roll up NATO right to Russia's doorstep, despite any rhetoric that might suggest otherwise.  I would look for Ukraine to likely be split, with part going to Russia, and the rest to NATO, unless Ukraine (with covert aid, I'm sure) manages to fend off ""Russian separatists"" AKA Russian soldiers.  It is entirely possible that they might fight them off, because Russia can't afford to openly commit full mobilization.  I'd look for more economic war, honestly, as tensions flare, more sanctions.    If Europe finds an alternative to Russian natural gas, its likely Russia will be more and more isolated, especially with continued border aggression.  All out war?  No, not likely at all, really.  Lots of hueing and crying, and stamping of feet.  Sanctions that cripple the economy, Saudi's and Iranians (and Iraquis) pumping more oil into a sodden market, and condemnation from many nations.  Look to the long game, the long process of US foreign policy towards the Soviet Union, and now carried towards Russia.  Containment, encirclement, perhaps choking off the economy to an extent.  But not outright war.  That serves nobody's purpose.  Putin would be exposed, the US would spend a lot of money for no gain...nobody wants it.  And, of course, there is the problem of two heavily armed nuclear powers slugging it out.  Nobody wants it.  Putin wants to nibble at the edges and rally his people with jingoism.  US wants to bottle up and contain the threat where it is.  Compromises will be made and people will talk tough, a few areas will change hands.

Not only that, we're seeing China attempt to acquire raw materials by themselves, without the help of Russia, through its mining infrastructure in Africa.  Right now I believe China sees closer ties with Russia as an ill-advised move at this stage of its development. China has come a long way in a very short amount of time and we've seen how quickly this growth can crack (the recent stock plummet) so the current Party is mindful of its precariousness.

Suddenly you need to increase the price of your manufactured goods to offset the losses. Now if China gains control over these raw materials i.e. they mine metals in Africa for use in manufacturing, that will go a long way to ensuring the viability of their current export strategy.  I'm not implying that China will get to a point where they don't ever have to trade, that's absurd. But it's what they're trading and where they get the materials to then make the goods they trade that is concerning.

I think you can expect something very similar for Russia, although the failing of Russia will be much faster, and much worse due to its size.  I think that the only way this is stopped would be if Putin recognizes the political changes occurring in China, and tries to block out the notion of converting to a different political system.  This is very likely, too.  Putin does not, and will not, want Russia becoming a democracy.  Recognizing the fact that China's government is becoming less totalitarianistic, and more democratic and transparent will be vital to Putin easily staying in power.  Otherwise he will be in for a PR fight of the ages.  He's been able to paint western civilization, like the US, UK, France, Germany, etc. in a very negative light.

NeutralPolitics,3dp4rg,putin_bot_0012345,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:13:15 2015 UTC,"The way you write that is exactly why I'm generally wary of Russia.    Russian society had great, untapped potential  ... Would still be a true power  I really hope he starts playing on the global scale again   I get the distinct impression that internally, culturally, the Russians just want to rule things. It isn't about ideology or outcomes for the world. It's just about exerting some level of control. I listened to a thing from a Russia correspondent back when Ukraine was boiling, and he described basically that - that the people in Russia aren'T as upset about the economic hardship or the political isolation... They just hate being irrelevant and weak. That's a scary place to start thinking about international action from.  And frankly, that, beyond anything else, is what's going to keep Russia isolated and economically depressed. The world has lost its appetite and tolerance for imperialism."
NeutralPolitics,3dp4rg,jokoon,0,Sat Jul 18 11:27:30 2015 UTC,"a global threat   I think you are using a very unusual definition of ""global"" or ""threat"". Because at the moment I can think of only one country that could be called a global threat (in the sense that in most parts of the globe, it has the capability to topple a weak government, kidnap or kill another nation's citizens, cripple a national economy or bankrupt an organization, strong-arm others to adopt its legal and cultural norms, and project the sort of kinetic power that could overcome any military alliance in the region); and that country is not called Russia. Russia can only afford to be a threat to parts of its immediate neighborhood.  Or perhaps you are confusing Russia with the old Soviet Union?"
NeutralPolitics,3dp4rg,Stacksup,7,Mon Jul 20 07:38:50 2015 UTC,"well, from your point of view, it seems that there is only one country on the list of global powers... not sure if that's very accurate...  however much you'd like to believe that"

As usual I cant tell if Putin is a canny geopolitical manipulator or a jack booted thug with more guns than brains. Probably somewhere between the two.

NeutralPolitics,3def2o,Kazmarov,41,Wed Jul 15 16:59:20 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone. Thanks for the goodbye thread.  NeutralPolitics has always been an experiment- a community like /r/AskScience has people of many different fields and specialties working together. But divisions in political thought are a lot different than the division between biology and chemistry. When this sub was made, there were no truly cross-partisan political communities of note. The main community, which was so wretched that it was delisted from the default set, had scared off a lot of different ideologies long ago. People concentrated in partisan communities and generally didn't interact much with those who are different.  I'd like to think that NP has done much to stitch together the realm of political debate on reddit. It is good to see liberals, conservatives, libertarians, socialists, radical centrists, and everyone beyond and inbetween still participating in the same discussions. NP has proven that Eternal September can be averted if a framework is upheld.  If you've been around for a couple years, you'll notice that our rules and guidelines shift often, and reflects the reality that some ideas fail and other are due for their turn. NP has on several occasions picked being principled over being popular- we once canned the most popular thread the community had ever had because it couldn't meet standards. If you ended up here, there's probably an interesting reason how you found out about NP, and why you stayed.  Thanks to people who have come to understand what neutral politics means, and how it's different than moderate politics.  All I know is, my gut says maybe."

NeutralPolitics,3dh0mw,CoffeeLovingGamer,14,Thu Jul 16 05:09:31 2015 UTC,"If you have the money, I would recommend subscribing to some intelligent news source, and just making a habit of reading it whenever you can. You will inevitably get fed whatever bias the publication tends to, but as long as you recognize that a good and regular news source is a great way to learn about it.  Personally, I'm going to channel my inner shill and recommend The Economist. Besides their regular weekly publication which covers news from all over the world (rather than the domestically centric topics that many American sources provide), and also releases a short summary of the day's news every morning on their Espresso app. They have what some would call a ""neoliberal"" bias, but it's all very intelligently written, and I enjoy their articles even if I sometimes disagree with their opinions.  I've heard good things about FT and WSJ, among other publications. In my experience, such ""financial"" sources are generally higher quality, as their audiences  often have a lot of money on the line in investments, so they need accurate information to make their financial decisions. Looking at the ads of a publication can also give you a good idea of who reads the publication and thus the quality of the writing and opinions, though that's a much more subjective method."
NeutralPolitics,3dh0mw,haalidoodi,3,Thu Jul 16 19:02:24 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the suggestions, I will look into the publications.  Your thought on adds and how they reveal the publication's audience makes sense, I will pay attention to that from now on."
NeutralPolitics,3dh0mw,MrFuffin,4,Thu Jul 16 19:57:38 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind, in politics (anything really) you really can't trust anyone (even me). The sources he gave you have quality and are well constructed but they have their agenda too. Economist and WSJ are going to give you a very business minded point of view.  The best thing you can do is learn to identify bias in any source. You may not be able to trust anyone, but rarely is anyone going tell a 100% lie. When reading anything try to find the author's angle. It will help you to find why he wrote it and what he used to do so. This can help you find more sources.  The more perspectives you can identify and understand the closer you can get to something approaching truth. Moreover, the most important bias to spot and see outside of, is your own."
NeutralPolitics,3dh0mw,teknobo,2,Fri Jul 17 20:41:17 2015 UTC,"As a finance and politics news junkie, I agree the Economist and FT are generally very solid publications. The Economist leans center-right but not overly so. The FT is great and about as neutral as they come IMO.  The Wall Street Journal is good as long as you skip their editorials. 99% of the criticism of the WSJ comes down to their editorials. They're usually garbage, but more relevant to this sub and thread, they are definitely not neutral, or even mildly-biased. They're often a full-throated defense of the current mainstream conservative position.  Especially since the WSJ was acquired by News Corporation in 2007.   That said, those three are all very finance and economics focused publications. Those subjects heavily overlap with politics, but they're still not quite politics in and of themselves. For more politics-focused reporting, you can usually use the newspapers of record as solid starting points, so the New York Times and/or the Washington Post. The Hill, CQ, and National Journal are also very well-respected for their neutral political coverage.   Staying informed is hard. You will eventually start to find publications that appeal to you more through their ideology or their writing style, and you'll want to read those more often. That's totally fine, just be aware of biases -- both yours and the journalists' -- and make sure you check their facts against more neutral publications."

NeutralPolitics,3dh0mw,haalidoodi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:30:55 2015 UTC,How do you define neoliberal?
NeutralPolitics,3dh0mw,Stone_Conqueror,6,Fri Jul 17 02:19:21 2015 UTC,"The reason I put it in quotes is because it's not really a proper political term, but more of a derogatory label applied to a range of people by others opposed to those people.   If I had to slap on a definition for the word, I'd say something similar to the Washington Consensus, though I'm still rather uncomfortable with the position, as it's really a synthesis of a range of various opinions from various fields, including economics, political science, sociology and so on, and even those that accept the Consensus can vary in opinion on its specifics by a fair bit."
NeutralPolitics,3dh0mw,caesarfecit,2,Fri Jul 17 02:28:44 2015 UTC,"Not OP, but in the context of the Economist's slant, neoliberalism is generally pro-deregulation, pro-privatization, pro-free/unregulated market, and pro-IMF/World Bank. I don't agree that it's necessarily a derogatory label, although many on the left certainly view it as a bad thing.   The specifics of what ""neoliberalism"" means are certainly debatable, but that's more of an academic discussion than anything else IMO."
NeutralPolitics,3dh0mw,Tullamore_Who,9,Fri Jul 17 18:26:54 2015 UTC,"Read and debate. It's that simple.   Step 1: sample news sources to help define your political leanings. Go on Fox News or Drudge. Like their offerings? You're probably somewhere on the right. Like HuffPo and WaPo/NYT? You're probably somewhere on the left. The key is to understand your leanings and your interests, and what you don't understand. Any learning process must start with some self-examination and breaking the ice.   Step 2: Read about ideas, thinkers, and history. Read about classical liberalism, the French Revolution, socialism, capitalism, Marxism, the progressive movement, the Cold War and everything in between. Browse some wiki articles on people like: Thomas Paine, Hobbes and Locke, Rousseau and Burke, Karl Marx and Ayn Rand. The more you understand the tree of political thought, the better you'll be able to navigate it and other people's views.    Step 3: Look into the lives and careers of famous leaders to understand what drives political success. What you're looking for is what made them stand out as political figures, and how they reacted to their times. Politics is ultimately about people, and what causes some people to rise to the front. Suggested research with an eye to modern politics would be: Start with FDR in 1932 and go forward to the present day. Don't forget to look at other leaders from other countries like Churchill, Thatcher and Blair of the UK, Trudeau and Harper from Canada, Putin, Stalin, and Gorbachev of the USSR/Russia, Hitler, Adenauer, and Merkel of Germany, De Gaulle of France etc.   Step 4: Debate. Develop both a circle of real people to talk politics with, and participate in Reddit debates. Ask questions, put ideas forward, and get your feet wet. Only the opposition shows you where you are weak.   Step 5: Develop an understanding of your political values. All politics boils down to this, and most people don't go this far but it's important. Nobody is a true perfect moderate unless they're totally ignorant of politics. And you can't argue clearly unless you understand your own biases and accept them. Everybody has them, the key is to be aware of them. Politics is the art of the possible and that means priorities. Nobody can hold every political end at equal value and have it mean anything.   Step 6: Read Henry George. I'm kidding. No I'm not. Or am I?"
NeutralPolitics,3dh0mw,SqoishMaloish,3,Fri Jul 17 03:16:39 2015 UTC,"Great points here.  I'd like to add that love/hate the site, everyone should at least check Drudge's headlines at least once a day.  Even Matt Drudge's greatest detractors acknowledge that he drives the daily news/debate cycle.  And NEVER accept one source.  If you find yourself rigorously agreeing with a certain article or editorial... That's a warning sign:  force yourself to hunt for legitimate editorials from the ""other"" perspective.  And even if you disagree, fight to understand that honest people might disagree with you (don't make piñata caricatures of them).  You'll find MSNBC to be just as mock-worthy as Fox, etc.  For world affairs, don't be afraid to read the BBC and seriously, Al Jazeera.  Americans will mock the foreign press without applying the same scrutiny/sometime mockery toward US press outlets.  Somewhere along the line, you'll find nuance.   Good luck!"

There is no better sign of a person who has no confidence in their own opinion.  It's one thing to disagree with a news source or opinion- that will always happen...

That is quite different than picking up on a meme that you just need to ignore ________ because _______ is evil and wrong all the time and so you should never watch _____.   One involves doing the work to determine what parts of a story are accurate and what parts are not... and can lead to a constructive conversation between you and a person you disagree with because you are able to hold the discussion using facts and see the argument from multiple sides... and one involves blind faith in a meme. It develops an opinion that becomes static rather than open.   The former is an example of looking at facts to determine an opinion and the latter  very quickly risks being ""Us Vs.

Although I don't have sources, so take it all with s grain of salt I guess."

From the interview i heard on NPR yesterday it seems like there is a 24 day window between the request and access which isn't exactly ""snap"" inspections, but I'm no nuclear scientist  so I can't tell exactly how hard it is to hide a lab but I think that's just too long.

According to critical mass limits, 15 kg  U233 or 52 kg U235 are enough for a sustained fission reaction.

Don't forget, the US and Britain were actively enforcing the 11 year-old no-fly zones over Iraq while the inspections were going on, including dramatically increased offensive sorties. That's a pretty good degree of leverage. If I governed a country where a foreign power was conducting regular bombing raids on my facilities and preventing any of my aircraft from flying, I'd certainly want to negotiate a stop to that.  It's also worth noting that Hans Blix, the UN weapons inspector at the time, whose team was in Iraq up until three days before the invasion, found no evidence of WMDs and calls the war a ""terrible mistake."" He disputes that it even had anything to do with the inspections.  This view was supported by the UN Security Council's refusal to back the war and many news organizations (mostly foreign, except for McClatchy) disputing the whole argument that inspectors were systematically prevented from doing their jobs."

The deal allows inspectors to also go to any other facility not mentioned in the treaty, but iran gets 14 days to negotiate with inspectors before it goes to the p5 countries and another 10 days to negotiate with them before sanctions are snapped back.   Ofcourse I can't comment either on how difficult it is to build nuclear weapons under these conditions, but I imagine its significantly harder than it was under the sanctions but no limits or inspections  The relevant part of the wiki   The IAEA will have multilayered[28] oversight ""over Iran's entire nuclear supply chain, from uranium mills to its procurement of nuclear-related technologies.""[29] For declared nuclear sites such as Fordow and Natanz, the IAEA will have ""round-the-clock access"" to nuclear facilities and will be entitled to maintain continuous monitoring (including via surveillance equipment) at such sites.[30][29] The agreement authorizes the IAEA to make use of sophisticated monitoring technology, such as fiber-optic seals on equipment that can electronically send information to the IAEA; infrared satellite imagery to detect covert sites, ""environmental sensors that can detect minute signs of nuclear particles""; tamper-resistant, radiation-resistant cameras.[31][17] Other tools include computerized accounting programs to gather information and detect anomalies, and big data sets on Iranian imports, to monitor dual-use items.[28]  If IAEA inspectors have concerns that Iran is developing nuclear capabilities at any non-declared sites, they may request access ""to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities or activities inconsistent with"" the agreement, informing Iran of the basis for their concerns.[30] The inspectors would only come from countries with which Iran has diplomatic relations.[32] Iran may admit the inspectors to such site or propose alternatives to inspection that might satisfy the IAEA's concerns.[30] If such an agreement cannot be reached, a process running to a maximum of 24 days is triggered.[30] Under this process, Iran and the IAEA have 14 days to resolve disagreements among themselves.[30] If they fail to, the Joint Commission (including all eight parties) would have one week in which to consider the intelligence which initiated the IAEA request. A majority of the Commission (at least five of the eight members) could then inform Iran of the action that it would be required to take within three more days.[33][34] The majority rule provision ""means the United States and its European allies—Britain, France, Germany and the EU—could insist on access or any other steps and that Iran, Russia or China could not veto them.""[33] If Iran did not comply with the decision within three days, sanctions would be automatically reimposed under the snapback provision (see below).[34]"

NeutralPolitics,3dgkbt,JoseJimeniz,3,Fri Jul 17 00:02:45 2015 UTC,You could use the results of their inspections in Iraq as a guide of past performance.  UNSCOM said there was no WMD's in Iraq. Five years later the US military went in to check for themselves and confirmed the findings.
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,Hypna,54,Tue Jul 14 17:59:24 2015 UTC,"People have addressed the quality of the deal, so I'll talk about the mechanics. Congress can negate the deal with a 2/3 majority (to avoid the veto on what would be a new bill), but they don't have to vote up or down to approve it. When the sanctions were initially placed, George W. Bush was president. In what was probably a political misstep, a Republican Congress gave the president unilateral power to remove most of the sanctions. That means that Congress doesn't have to actually approve the deal, since the American part of the deal only involves lifting the sanctions the president directly controls."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,definitelyjoking,23,Tue Jul 14 20:16:21 2015 UTC,It's also important to note that the removal of US sanctions is only a small part compared to the removal of international sanctions (which congress has no say in whatsoever).
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,red_nick,8,Tue Jul 14 20:51:45 2015 UTC,Absolutely true. I have a hard time believing that the deal goes through as-is without the US sanctions being removed though.

NeutralPolitics,3da34g,red_nick,14,Tue Jul 14 21:06:17 2015 UTC,"They should. The US is the largest market in the world. Additionally, the present deal places the US as a member of a panel responsible for making future sanction decisions, like re-lifting sanctions after a lapse. This panel is balanced so that Russia, China and Iran can't sway the panel on their own. If the US weren't participating in sanctions relief, that whole arrangement would be thrown into disarray."

NeutralPolitics,3da34g,gordo65,161,Tue Jul 14 21:25:07 2015 UTC,"It's an incredibly good deal for the United States in that it concedes several major points that were sources of major contention between Iran and the other parties.   Firstly, IAEA inspectors will (theoretically) have almost unlimited access to Iranian facilities, something that the Iranians have been resisting for years by limiting access to many sites. Secondly, sanctions will both be lifted gradually over time as the program is conformed to, and will immediately snap back in the case of a violation (Iran had been pushing for immediate lifting of all sanctions and no automatic mechanism in the case of perceived violation). A major victory for the US and on the outer boundary of what could have been peacefully negotiated, and I'm appalled to hear people claiming that it doesn't go far enough.  While I have heard people claiming that this deal simply buys Iran more time to develop its bomb, but I have to disagree: the significant concessions made suggest that a nation led by Rohani's relatively reformist government, and struggling with high unemployment and inflation, is finally looking for a way out. In the long run, I would hope that this is a first step in a rapprochement between Iran and the US, leading to normalized and eventually, perhaps even friendly relations. While not a perfect nation or government by any means, they are certainly more democratic than our traditional ally, Saudi Arabia, and advocate what is certainly a more moderate version of Islam than Saudi Wahhabism. Given the right encouragement, they may prove to be a powerful force for stability in the region. And I'll admit this is my opinion, but all else held equal I believe Iran to be a better potential ally than the Saudis."

It helps open the country up to the world, and it will bring the country a lot of much-needed oil revenue.  You know who this is a really bad deal for? Putin. The West doesn't need Putin to help them deal with Iran anymore, and the price of oil will fall as a result of this deal, putting further pressure on Russia's already strained economy.  It's also a very bad deal for fundamentalist Islamic terrorist organizations, which are partly dependent on donations from oil-rich states.  Finally, it's a very bad deal for whichever Republican will run against Hillary Clinton. With the economy doing well, the Republican will probably try to fall back on foreign policy as an avenue of attack. It's not easy to launch a foreign policy attack against the de facto candidate of the status quo during a time of easing tensions."

I don't understand. If another oil-rich Arab country starts selling their stock, doesn't that mean that fundamentalist Islamist groups will have one more source of funding?  I know Iran is largely Shia, but there are Shia and Shia-friendly terrorist organizations - and Iran has made it clear that it has no qualms of funding them. It's still listed as an active terror sponsor, due in no small part to the amount of militants and equipment that move through it.  Won't this mean that it's a good deal for Islamist extremists?"

There is a gigantic qualitative difference between groups like Hezbollah and groups like Al Qaeda. Also, when the price of oil goes down, there is less overall money being spent on oil. Since Middle Eastern terrorist groups of all kinds depend largely on oil revenues, that means less money overall for terrorist groups in the region. And if some of the money goes to Hezbollah rather than to Al Qaeda, that's also a good thing."

The sanctions on Iran never made sense in the first place, Israeli PM said in 2012 that Iran would have a bomb in a year... its been 3 years now and no bomb. Meanwhile Israel itself has a nuclear program that it hides and refuses to let IAEA inspect its facilities and has even refuses to sign the NNPT. Why have they never been questioned about this? where is their sanctions?  Iran hasn't attacked a country since their invasion of Basra in Iraq which took place in 1798. That is 217 years ago and yet everyone is buying the propaganda for all these years."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,perihelion9,2,Fri Jul 17 01:55:11 2015 UTC,"I wish you were right. Iran facilitates and funds AQ. Even without direct funding, Iran shelters the Bin Laden family and transports AQ militants and materiel, and you don't need to reach far to see plenty of historical examples of more of the same.  Iran supports AQ. It's not a matter of Sunni/Shia, it's a matter of what's convenient to Iran; because even while they support AQ affiliates in the east and west, to their south they actively enable the Houthis to battle AQY. It's chess, not an ideology.   Meanwhile Israel itself has a nuclear program that it hides and refuses to let IAEA inspect its facilities and has even refuses to sign the NNPT.   You don't know that, no public knows the truth of that. Israel has made veiled references that they won't be the first to introduce nuclear weapons, but it could be a bluff - some would even say that given how long they've maintained that line, and how zero evidence of its backing has emerged, that it probable is a bluff.    Iran hasn't attacked a country since their invasion of Basra in Iraq which took place in 1798.    Military strength against others is not always waged by a sovereign nation. You must understand, Iran's army is purely to protect the sovereignty of Iran, not as a weapon to defeat its enemies. For that, it funds terrorism and proxy wars. And it's not particularly secretive about that."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,gordo65,2,Fri Jul 17 02:35:52 2015 UTC,"Alright the first part I agree, I've read into it that.  About Israel though. Is it not one bit unusual to refuse the IAEA inspections? We know that because it was talked about all the time in the past year. They clearly have a nuclear program and, peaceful or not, they do not let anyone go in there. How is that allowed? Cause from what I read this is pretty hypocritical. Iran can't be trusted, even though they haven't officially done anything aggressive, while Israel has had conflicts with its neighboring countries for decades.  And yea yea... Iran funds terrorists like every other country in the region and just like the US, Russia, China and all other big countries. I mean France just randomly decided to send weapons to rebels in another country, isn't that funding terrorism?  I know plenty of Libyans and Syrians. They didn't love their government but now they've lost everything. One of the waiters at the cafe I work in was telling me how war made things a thousand times worse in Syria.  These funding terrorism statements sound very hypocritical. Iraq was funded by the West and Gulf nations to invade Iran.   I think they're misunderstood more than anything."

But that makes the ""bluffing"" argument that much stronger. If they were bluffing, they obviously wouldn't let someone reveal that they're playing poker with no trump card. Until there's any sort of evidence that they've ever had nuclear weapons, or something more than suspicions, I don't think it's intellectually honest to say they do have nuclear weapons. In fact given their behavior and for how long they've maintained the same line, i'd say it's improbable that they have them. Secrets like that have short shelf lives, and it's been a long time.   Iran can't be trusted, even though they haven't officially done anything aggressive, while Israel has had conflicts with its neighboring countries for decades.   Iran openly funds groups which target civilians, whereas Israel has been invaded by its neighbors for the last few decades. This goes back to how military force is used; Israel has a powerful standing army to protect its sovereignty, while its enemies have resorted to proxy wars since standing armies have had little success in slaughtering Israelis.   I mean France just randomly decided to send weapons to rebels in another country, isn't that funding terrorism?   The main thing about terrorism is ""targeting civilians"". Sending weapons to militants is not necessarily terrorism; especially when those militants are aiming to fight another military force. There is no conflict where ground is gained or lost without civilian casualty, but there's a big difference between targeting civilians and having them caught in a crossfire.  Blowing up a bus or kidnapping little girls for political ransom is terrorism, but seizing a town from your enemy military which has some straggling civilians who are killed during the struggle is not terrorism.   Iran funds terrorists like every other country in the region and just like the US, Russia, China and all other big countries.   As an addendum to the point above, you might be better served by taking a quick survey of just how much civilian targeting the various labelled-terrorist groups do when compared to West-backed militants. Take a stroll through the histories of Hezbollah, AQ, IS, Houthi, Boko Haram, the Taliban and the Muhajadeen - can you even begin to count the number of civilians they've targeted? Contrast that to the Kurds, or FSA, or the post-invasion Iraqi army. How often are they bombing civilians?  You're right that civilians die at the hands of both sides, but you're out of perspective when it comes to the intent, scale, and frequency at which different groups make that happen.   I know plenty of Libyans and Syrians. They didn't love their government but now they've lost everything.   We're getting a bit off-base here, but bear in mind that Libya, Syria, and Yemen only became unstable because of the Arab Spring. Widespread protests allied moderates with radicals against the dictatorial governments at exactly the time when caliphate-driven Islamism was most influential, and now we've a soupy mess of three-way civil wars. To credit the West with kicking that off is stretching credibility pretty far."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,GTFErinyes,2,Fri Jul 17 06:58:19 2015 UTC,"Both of which have been funded and aided by Iran.   There's very little evidence that Iran has been funding Al Qaeda. There have been lawsuits against Iran for their supposed involvement in attacks against the US, but they typically involve specious evidence that goes unchallenged because the Iranian government refuses to participate in the trials.   How does Iran getting richer mean that fundamentalist groups will have less money?   As I've already said, lower oil prices means less total money flowing to countries that are sources of funding for terrorist groups in the Middle East."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,smokebreak,6,Fri Jul 17 07:20:47 2015 UTC,"A major victory for the US and on the outer boundary of what could have been peacefully negotiated, and I'm appalled to hear people claiming that it doesn't go far enough.   I'm with you here: I consider it a major victory. Iran has been isolated for far too long - and, I might add, by choice of their top brass, not their people - and this is a huge step in the right direction (admittedly, at the right time as well, if not a a bit late - Rouhani deserves a lot of credit for pulling through on Iran's end).  I don't necessarily agree with the pessmism of the likes of Ray Takeyh or Richard Haass, but I do think this excerpt from the latter's interview sums up the legitimate reasons (not the ones peddled by the likes of fearmongering, rabble-rousing politicians) we have to be wary of this agreement:   You don't think over the next ten years or so we can woo Iran into our Western bosom?  There's clearly a hope or belief on the part of many in the administration, apparently reinforced by the Iranian foreign minister, that this agreement has the potential to do just that. To use [former U.S. diplomat] George Kennan's term, some believe this agreement has the potential to lead to a ""mellowing"" of Iran. I call that wishful thinking. I can't rule it out, I hope it's true. But I for one don't see it. If anything the flow of resources will work in the opposite direction. Iran believes it's on something of a strategic roll. So I doubt that will happen. But in any event since we can't know, I would simply say it would be a mistake to in any way defend this agreement on the basis that it will lead to a change in Iran's character or behavior. At no point over the duration of this agreement ought we cut Iran any slack on the details of the agreement, which affects capabilities, in the hope that somehow its intentions evolve. That would be a real mistake.  I had assumed that there is such a build up of interest among the Iranian middle class that this would lead to a warming with the United States, and that once the current ayatollah passed from the scene that there would be a new opening in Iran.  I can't say you're wrong. And I hope you're right. But we do have the likely succession at the ayatollah level. You have political succession in the course of this agreement. You have the powerful interest groups in Iran: clerics, the Revolutionary Guard, bazaaris, and others. You have class divisions in Iran as we saw in the so-called June [2009] revolution. So I would again think yes, it is quite possible that some elements of Iranian society in the Iranian political space will try to run with this agreement and to reintegrate Iran with the world. And I expect others will push back. I don't think we can be confident that we know how this will play out. It is even possible in the short run that many in Iran's leadership will need to do radical things simply to demonstrate that they haven't somehow sold out the revolution by signing this agreement with the ""Great Satan."" So everyone should be careful about predicting or assuming in any way that this will lead to a moderating of Iran's behavior towards its own citizens or toward its neighbors.   Philip Gordon makes the very good point that this was the best deal we were going to get - Haass disagrees, but I'm inclined towards Gordon's argument - and the fact remains that despite the sunset provisions, it's a good deal. I think the fact that even Cato's Justin Logan praises the deal is quite telling.  There is one very, very real concern that Gordon discusses in the linked podcast: that the Iranian people themselves are a wildcard. They have been - in my opinion - the driving force and sole reason that we have been able to come so far with Iran. Despite Iran's theocratic government ability to strangle the public's political power, Rouhani was elected to office to save them from the poverty that sanctions have caused, and now that Rouhani has made this monumentous first step, there's this massive expectation that something will change.  But it's going to be a gradual process, which our leaders here in the West have made abundantly clear, that will hinge on ""verification, not trust"", and in the interim, as the world waits for the IAEA's a-ok to move ahead with lifting sanctions, Iranian public opinion, I think, and how the story plays out in their media is going to be a decisive factor in how this works out in 15 years.  Hopefully, if this agreement goes south, we're not the ones that send it there. Hopefully, the story in 15 years is that we tried."

Given the right encouragement, they may prove to be a powerful force for stability in the region. And I'll admit this is my opinion, but all else held equal I believe Iran to be a better potential ally than the Saudis.   Let's not go so far there just yet.  The Iranians are a democracy in that people vote, sure, but actual government power is not in the hand of the voters. The crackdown on the 2009 Iranian protestors after the election are a good example of the government getting what it wants, with force if necessary.  The other problem is that people are conflating Saudi citizens with the Saudi government on the issue of terrorism and human rights.  The Saudi royal family gives Wahhabi clerics a lot of leeway in their country on domestic affairs because they use them to legitimize their rule over the country, despite their oft-reported less-than-hardline-Islamic doings in the world. Indeed, the founding of Saudi Arabia came about with House Saud allying with the Wahhabi Ikhwan to carve the territory that is today Saudi Arabia in the 1920s.  Of course, Saudi Arabia has gotten rich in the last few decades due to its oil wealth, which has allowed a lot of Wahhabi clerics and followers to gain financial wealth to be used to fund mosques and organizations around the world.  The Saudi government itself has had problems with Islamic extremists - the 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque, coinciding with the Islamic Revolution in Iran that same month in fact, shook the Saud family to its core. They allowed Wahhabi clerics more leeway in enforcing their strict Sharia law to relieve pressure on the monarchy. Indeed, a big impetus for them sending their citizens - like Osama bin Laden - to Afghanistan was that it would get the militant citizens out of the country.  Keep in mind that Osama and Al Qaeda didn't just declare war on the West - they declared war on the Saudi government as well for hosting US troops in Saudi territory during and after the Gulf War of 1991. Saudi territory, which includes Mecca and Medina the holiest sites in Islam, is considered holy land to many Islamists and that was a sin too great to forgive.  Meanwhile, Iran's government has actively supported terrorist groups in the region and around the world. It doesn't enforce the same strict Wahhabism on daily life as Saudi Arabia, but it still enforces religious law and theocratic rule and that doesn't look like it will be changing anytime soon. It is an actual governmental policy to support said groups - now whether that is reined in or not after the deal remains to be seen. From my experience though, geopolitical considerations often trump all other considerations.  Keep in mind that Iran is far more rural and undeveloped than the Saudis are - and poorer as well, meaning the average hardline citizen has less ability to influence the world. Yes, there is an educated urban population in Iran - but they exist in Saudi Arabia too, and are far smaller in Iran compared to the majority of the population.  If and when that changes, all bets are off that Iran is going to suddenly be a major force for stability in that region, especially since their geopolitical rivals - the Gulf countries - have their own agendas and certainly do not trust Iran. An arms race is as likely as the sides suddenly deciding to go for peace."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,tankguy33,15,Wed Jul 15 04:34:43 2015 UTC,"Given the right encouragement, they may prove to be a powerful force for stability in the region.    I am curious about this statement, given that Iran's Shi'ism is directly at odds with all of the other (Sunni) countries in the region.  Is it simply because Iran's population is so much larger than the rest of the region combined?  Do you think peace can exist without large, stable Shi'ite and Sunni leadership, i.e., that both sides must agree to work together, i.e., that there is an end to this that doesn't include an outright war between the Saudis and Iranians?"
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,haalidoodi,18,Wed Jul 15 04:14:58 2015 UTC,"When it comes to Iran, it's usually good not to overestimate the depth of the Sunni-Shi'i divide.    The key argument when it comes to this deal eventually translating to stability is that it provides Iran with a way out of diplomatic isolation.  Almost since the revolution, Iran has been diplomatically isolated from the region, which has caused it to be artificially weakened in economic and military terms and has forced it to develop strategies that allow it to project power through alternative, mostly soft power channels.  With Iran moving closer to the United States, Iran would be able to (slowly) become more comfortable doing less of this sort of thing, theoretically contributing to less open sectarian conflict.   If the United States weren't ""picking sides"" between the Saudis and Iranians, that makes war between them extremely unlikely.  With a more neutral US in the Gulf, neither nation should* feel the need to escalate the cold war to a hot one, because they'd both be provided a buffer that wouldn't tolerate open conflict between them.  Obviously the proxy conflict would continue, but it would be a less essential element of Iranian policy when it's less threatened.  The Sunni-Shi'i divide, while important, is not the key root of the Iran-Saudi conflict.  Just because they have religious differences doesn't make conflict inevitable, and both sides have been willing to work with other sectarian groups when it suits their national interests."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,PubliusPontifex,19,Tue Jul 14 18:45:44 2015 UTC,"The Sunni-Shi'a split isn't what is keeping Iran from making peace with the Arab countries or vice-versa. There are plenty of Sunni in Iran and plenty of Shi'a in other countries.   The issue is a long and complicated history of tit-for-tat conflicts that have raised whole generations of leaders who have nothing but hate for one another. This deal has a lot of potential, as /u/haalidoodi mentioned, to temper those tensions.  It would be way too naive to think that Iran is going to play nice after one deal on a very specific topic. HOWEVER, it has established diplomatic ties that have not existed since the 1950s. Iran and the US have a lot of similar ambitions in the region, and hopefully mutual benefit can persuade Iran to stop funding murder and chaos from Syria to Yemen."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,haalidoodi,6,Tue Jul 14 19:12:54 2015 UTC,"I understand this is not a completely accurate parallel, but you could certainly look at the current situation in Christianity for that answer. When the Protestant churches began to split, Europe saw massive conflict--I've heard estimates that during just the Thirty Years War, which started as a conflict over faith in the HRE, between a third and half of the entire German population died. And this is not to mention events like St. Bart's Day Massacre and all the other religious violence of the period. But eventually things were resolved between Catholics and the various sects, and today conflict between Catholics and Protestants is virtually nonexistent. My hope is that the same can be achieved in Islam eventually, if less fundamentalist interpretations are promoted and accepted and the other causes of conflict (poverty, ethnic strife, the aftereffects of colonialism) are dealt with appropriately."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,GTFErinyes,7,Tue Jul 14 18:53:37 2015 UTC,"The rapprochement started years ago, this is simply the first tangible result.  We should be closer to Iran's educated urban population than we should be to KSA's brutal religious population, as should Israel."

That's not a very accurate assessment though - Iran's educated urban population is the minority in Iran.   Most of Saudi Arabia's population is actually urban and actually well educated as well - the Saudi Arabian population is far from a bunch of Wahhabi nomads. Where Saudi influence comes into play is the fact that they have very wealthy members that do hold hardline views, something that the relatively poor Iranian population does not."

NeutralPolitics,3da34g,Ewannnn,5,Wed Jul 15 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"I think the most important point you made here is that this could lead to a shift, or at least some modest change, in how the United States deals with the Middle East. It's a shame that we count the Saudi's as an ally and the Iranians as an enemy. The Saudi's have access to a nuclear weapon. They fund terrorist organizations, too. And their human rights record is far more atrocious than Iran's. They're not even democratic! (Iran is at least more democratic than they are). And regarding the cause for the rift in American - Iranian relations, is it really surprising how they reacted? We supported a brutal dictator in their country and they were reacting to their violation of sovereignty."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,mcollins1,3,Fri Jul 17 02:44:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly my point. It's a real shame that we give the Saudis any sort of support at all, and in the long run I'm sure it has caused more problems than the alliance has alleviated. You are right that Iran is more of a democracy than SA, and more importantly has better potential for democratic reform than the obscenely oppressive Saudi regime.   America did lots of nasty stuff during the Cold War in the name of pushing back communism. It was so easy back then to divide the world into those two ideologies, with all other ideologies nothing more than cover or a vehicle for the enemy. And after a half-century of international brutality the Americans wonder why they encounter so much hostility...I don't mean to single out the US, the Soviets were just as bad and the leaders of both nations were simply products of their time, unable to really understand the third world and instead applying the standards and conflicts of the West upon the entire Earth. Now we're seeing the consequences of this old paradigm."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,skidmarkeddrawers,2,Fri Jul 17 16:48:14 2015 UTC,"Iran needs a lot of democratic reform, it's still essentially entirely run by the Supreme Leader Khamenei.

This doesnt even include all of the other covert support given to paramilitary groups that lead to coups."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,haalidoodi,2,Wed Jul 15 02:52:03 2015 UTC,all else held equal I believe Iran to be a better potential ally than the Saudis.    What really helps this case is the fact that both nation states will have to deal with the greater diplomatic tension which this accord allows.  That means the international community will have a major bargaining chip to force the Saudis to increasingly compete: by this I mean they would be less able to use oil against the global community as a kind of bribe for whatever they want to do in their region of the world.
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,yep45,3,Wed Jul 15 15:21:49 2015 UTC,"will immediately snap back in the case of a violation   Isn't this contingent on whether Europe, Russia, and China will join the US in snapping back sanctions in that event? I.e. it's very unlikely to happen?  I think the major thing going for this deal is that it is better than the alternative of not doing anything. International sanctions can't hold much longer - if this deal were to be scuttled, the Europeans, Russians, and Chinese would probably begin to drop theirs anyway. It would be a major defeat for the US and the Iranian economy would improve one way or another.  Maybe it is better to save face, get a deal that has a structure that we can somewhat work within, and that gives the US some legitimacy in case Iran breaks the treaty and maybe it can convince the others to reimpose sanctions.  But ultimately any easing of sanctions that will improve the Iranian economy will certainly lead to increased capabilities in fomenting strategic disorder around the Middle East. Absolute best case scenario is that an improved economy will further moderate or even liberalize the regime over time, but it would be naive to assume that is going to be the next step."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,tootie,4,Wed Jul 15 17:27:54 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned in a discussion with another user, American snapbacks are by far the most critical because of American control of the international financial system: the US can make economic life very difficult for pretty much any nation, making it very difficult to finance debt, conduct international trade and move and store assets. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if economic hardship caused by American sanctions was a primary driver for the concessions Iran made during the negotiations.    Absolute best case scenario is that an improved economy will further moderate or even liberalize the regime over time, but it would be naive to assume that is going to be the next step.   Absolutely agree with this: while the sanctions may have pushed Iran to the negotiating table, they also serve to radicalize the population against the West. As the revolution and the events that led up to it fade into the past, the only practical reason the average Iranian has to dislike the US (besides, perhaps, its alignment with Saudi Arabia) is the economic hardship it causes. Not to mention that by increasing economic relations with the West, cultural exchange will also be facilitated, encouraging the further development of democracy."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,Blooregard_Q_Kazoo_,2,Wed Jul 15 17:56:41 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that the snap-backs are automatic, meaning once the IAEA finds them to be in breach, none of the signatories have any decisions to make.

Firstly, IAEA inspectors will (theoretically) have almost unlimited access to Iranian facilities,   Totally 100% unequivocally false. They have to request access from a counsel that Iran sits on which can take up to 24 days for approval. WAY more than enough time to move anything they don't want seen.    Secondly, sanctions will both be lifted gradually over time as the program is conformed to, and will immediately snap back in the case of a violation   False, a lot of the sanctions are lifted day one. The ones in 5 years are a major problem in that they can now get conventional weapons and ballistic missiles which will end up in terrorists hands. The idea that China and Russia will agree to ""snap back"" (hilarious use of admins talking points) is very naive. Also what is the time frame to ""snap back?""   A major victory for the US and on the outer boundary of what could have been peacefully negotiated, and I'm appalled to hear people claiming that it doesn't go far enough.   This isn't a reason to take a bad deal. This is a bad deal.    While I have heard people claiming that this deal simply buys Iran more time to develop its bomb, but I have to disagree: the significant concessions made suggest that a nation led by Rohani's relatively reformist government, and struggling with high unemployment and inflation, is finally looking for a way out.   This completely ignores Iran's history of deal making and their entire ideology.   While not a perfect nation or government by any means, they are certainly more democratic than our traditional ally   What in the world are you talking about? Their president is a figure head. They have a supreme leader, a religious fanatic.   Given the right encouragement, they may prove to be a powerful force for stability in the region.   Again, this is totally naive.

You want to get into specifics, fine.   I would not have taken any deal with inspections predicated on a 24 day heads up to Iran. That alone makes the deal a complete failure. I would never take a deal that allows Iran to supply terrorists with conventional weapons, which they 100% no doubt will do. Even Obama admitted it today in his press conference with the added fallacy that it was this deal or they get a bomb.

That's not how long the IAEA has to get access: that's how long Iran has, once the IAEA finds discrepancies, to prove they're not hiding something. The deal itself - if you read it - moreover, makes multiple stipulations for the IAEA to have unfettered access to numerous facilities, and may inspect them at their discretion as frequently as daily. See, e.g. Annex 1, H-51, P-71, also:   If the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities or activities inconsistent with the JCPOA cannot be verified after the implementation of the alternative arrangements agreed by Iran and the IAEA, or if the two sides are unable to reach satisfactory arrangements to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities or activities inconsistent with the JCPOA at the specified locations within 14 days of the IAEA’s original request for access, Iran, in consultation with the members of the Joint Commission, would resolve the IAEA’s concerns through necessary means agreed between Iran and the IAEA. In the absence of an agreement, the members of the Joint Commission, by consensus or by a vote of 5 or more of its 8 members, would advise on the necessary means to resolve the IAEA's concerns. The process of consultation with, and any action by, the members of the Joint Commission would not exceed 7 days, and Iran would implement the necessary means within 3 additional days.   Snap backs are also implemented immediately: in the occasion of any violation, UN sanctions are immediately reinstated, pending UNSC approval to lift sanctions once more.  As for the rest of your sentiment, it seems that you would've preferred nothing versus this deal: and to you, I ask, why? This is a region of the world where we have zero credibility, zero political capital (save for Israel, and given how much Bibi likes his bully pulpit, we're rapidly losing there as well), and zero influence. This deal is a way of giving us all that. We've long since exhausted the soft power we had there: this gives us a chance to get it back."

The main thing that was repeated was that it was ""too much risk for us, and too much reward for Iran"". Lifting sanctions immediately (which by the way many of the sanctions being lifted were put in place for Iran's human rights abuses and reasons that don't have to do with Iran's nuclear program) will give Iran a huge flux of cash, which we can pretty much guarantee some will be used to finance activities against the west, whether it be funding the shia rebels in Yemen, backing President Assad in Syria, backing Hamas in Gaza, they have been pretty friendly to Al Qaeda, and an entire branch of their army call the Quds Force (pls google them) has been labeled a terrorist organization by the US and Canada (as most recent as 2012 for Canada). Iran is almost (with the exception of ISIS) on the opposite side as the West on almost every diplomatic mission we have in the Middle East. I agree with many who believe that their goal is to keep the east destabilized so that they can get gov't in that are more friendly to them, since crazy Syria is really one of the only countries on their side. And here we are about to give one of our biggest enemies a giant influx of cash that is going to travel to all these places of conflict.    Also we are going to give them the ability to trade arms after 5 years, which is crazy since they will have the ability to gain inter ballistic missiles that can reach the united states. All while allowing them to continue to enrich uranium and keep the infrastructure of their nuclear program in place.   So here we are let's say 7 years down the road, and we will have a much more economically stronger Iran, an Iran that has a much bigger arsenal of weapons to attack the US, Europe and other countries in the middle east, and a nuclear program in place where they can reach a break out point of most likely under a year. Our situation with them really hasn't gotten any better, in fact I believe, it has gotten much worse.   Now what happens? Does Iran use their new arsenal of weapons and use their small break out time window to gain a nuclear weapon? Probably not, but they will be in the position to gain even more traction in the Middle East, continue with their human rights violation (which by the way is killing tons of Sunnis, some Christians, jews, suppressing or killing gays, suppressing women, etc) they will continue funding their attacks against the west, and basically being a big bully with a bad agenda that creates instability. For all the good things I've read about Iran in reddit, I'm seriously shocked that the people don't realize that we are promoting a government that is seriously backwards when it comes to human rights.   Yea, I'm not saying WWIII will break out because of this deal, but it is seriously not good for us to allow one of our largest enemies to become significantly stronger without really gaining anything. I mean the whole point of this deal is to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and it doesn't do that. It just slows them from getting one. The Obama Administration is clearly coming from a position of trying to contain a nuclear Iran. I think they have already conceded that Iran is going to gain a nuclear weapon and are just trying to slow the process. The difference between them getting one now and them getting one in 5-10 years, is that in 5-10 years they will be a MUCH stronger Iran with a nuclear weapon."

What they have to ask permission for is for other sites that they deem suspicious. This makes sense because why would Iran give up all of it's sovereignty and allow the IAEA to go wherever they want? Only under the most extreme situations (e.g. losing a war or being occupied) would any country allow that. Especially considering our history of abusing the power in Iraq.  But they still get access to these site and being denied access  (after 24 days or something like that) would be considered a violation of the agreement.   Nvm literally every single deal ever made with Iran where they completely ignore the rules.   And the deal has in place the ability to revoke the easing of economic sanctions if the IAEA even suspects that they are breaking the rules.
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,EatMiTits,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:10:06 2015 UTC,"Because there is absolutely no way Iran will think to develop nukes at another site.   The agreement allows for a ""long-term IAEA presence in Iran"" to monitor materials and nuclear development that wouldn't be used in weapons. Inspectors will have continuous monitoring capabilities at known nuclear facilities like Fordow fuel enrichment plant and the Natanz enrichment facility. For other areas in the country, including military sites where there is suspected nuclear activity, IAEA inspectors will have to request access.  If inspectors have concerns that Iran is developing its nuclear capabilities at any of the non-official nuclear sites, they are allowed to request access ""for the sole reason to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities or activities inconsistent with"" the agreement. They must also inform Iran of the basis for their concerns.  Iran, in response, can propose alternatives to inspection that might satisfy the IAEA's concerns, the deal says. But if they can't come to an agreement to satisfy the inspectors within 14 days of the original request for access, the issue goes to a joint commission that consists of representatives from the P5+1 powers (the U.S., China, Russia, France, the United Kingdom and Germany), Iran, and the European High Representative for Foreign Affairs. They have another seven days to reach an agreement that must be supported at least five of the eight members. If they decide inspectors should get access, Iran has three days to provide it.  Sharon Squassoni, the director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Proliferation Prevention Program, told CBS News.  Squassoni said Iran does have a lot of room to ""wiggle out of things"" if they don't want to give inspectors access. They could also take advantage of the 24-day delay to pave or paint over evidence of building the components needed to produce a nuclear weapon.  And the deal has in place the ability to revoke the easing of economic sanctions if the IAEA even suspects that they are breaking the rules.   So they might be able to roll them back if China and Russia agree and Iran goes back to where it is now."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,blipblooop,2,Wed Jul 15 18:31:28 2015 UTC,"Because there is absolutely no way Iran will think to develop nukes at another site.   Part of the inspection agreement is that it is from top to bottom. The idea is to closely monitor all steps of the process (from extraction to enrichment to study to storage) to make it extremely difficult to divert nuclear material from their legitimate chain to some illegitimate one chain used for weapons development.  To do this, they would need an entirely new chain. . .which would take a long time and be difficult without shifting their best people from the legitimate chain to the illegitimate one, and the latter would definitely draw some suspicion.  Is it absolutely fool proof? No. But if that is your metric for a ""good deal"" then it is obvious that no deal short of Iran totally giving up all of its sovereignty would be considered ""good.""   So they might be able to roll them back if China and Russia agree and Iran goes back to where it is now.   Part of the agreement includes a lot of things that Iran must first do before sanctions start being lifted. They have to reduce their stockpiles (by 97%), give up 75% of their enrichment capabilities and have to keep all of their enriched uranium well below levels they can easily get to now. Once the sanctions get lifted, they will be much further from a bomb than they are now, so ""going back"" to where they are now would take a significant amount of time."

However, if Iran attained nuclear weapons or appeared close to attaining them, this could prompt Israel to bolster their own supply. This in turn would only reinforce Iran's desire to attain more nuclear weapons. Not really sure what's unclear about my original question. Perhaps ""arms race"" was the wrong terminology, but as /u/joatmon-snoo summarized  eloquently, this an already unstable and hostile region where the people of different nations hate and distrust each other on principle, and throwing nuclear weapons into the mix is a dangerous proposition."

It requires escalation and paranoia on both sides. My concern mainly lies with the fact that this could further deteriorate relations between Israel and Iran and could have catastrophic results. It could very well be the start of a new age of diplomacy with Iran that opens the door to a peaceful, stable Middle East and we should all hope for that. But given the current political climate that seems dubious at best."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,blipblooop,2,Wed Jul 15 05:34:50 2015 UTC,"Academics are noting this possibility as well, primarily because a long persevering problem in the Middle East has been a proclivity not for cooperation, but for competition and subterfuge.  One big concern that the Council of Foreign Relation's Ray Takeyh has noted is that this deal confers legitimacy upon Iran's nuclear deal, which critics consider a very dangerous message. Considering, moreover, how poorly nuclear energy is doing in the West in the wake of (largely unwarranted) safety concerns in the wake of Fukushima and the wealth of many Middle Eastern countries, I think it is a salient concern.  I don't think, however, that an arms race is likely in the slightest, for a couple reasons - and here, I ask for people to double-check, because this is far from my realm of expertise - for a couple of reasons. Iran's nuclear program been as successful as it is (not very) because it acquired a solid foundation for its nuclear infrastructure in the heyday of nuclear energy (src) bolstered by cooperation with other nuclear powers, namely, NK and Russia.  Other countries in the region largely don't have the former advantage, which means that they'd have to somehow obtain the necessary technology to do so. This isn't impossible, but it's an extraordinarily difficult - existing technology is incredibly heavily regulated, to say nothing of the import/export regulations on it - and expensive task to do so. Saudi Arabia may well be the only nation in the area with the wealth needed to accomplish something of the sort, and they aren't exactly best friends with Russia - I doubt Putin is willing to go that far just to piss the West off; at least, I see little tangible benefit for Russia to do so - nor NK, to say nothing of how much that would jeopardize their relationship with the US. If that wasn't enough, S.A. also lacks the brains for something like this: their education system focuses more on religious indoctrination rather than actual science, and combined with other factors, has resulted in a massive brain drain.  EDIT: I just found this discussion by arms control experts which I haven't read, but is probably a very good discussion of the salient issues."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,EatMiTits,2,Wed Jul 15 06:51:31 2015 UTC,"Saudi Arabia definitely has the technology and wealth to build a nuclear weapon and have been a financier of Pakistan's nuclear program. While we don't know either way, they could have a nuke with their name on it in Pakistan that just needs to be transported when they say so. Other countries that could pursue nuclear weapons are thought to be Egypt, Turkey, UAE and other gulf states. What's stopping them from doing so is the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the real danger here is the treaty completely falling apart."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,blipblooop,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:14:09 2015 UTC,"I would be more worried to see how Israel (who already has nuclear weaponry) will respond to this. Not that I believe they would use it preemptively, but I have seen it suggested that they could use traditional missile and airstrikes to attempt to cripple Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran would then insist that their facilities were meant solely for peaceful purposes, and that Israel's unprovoked and unwarranted attack was cause retaliation. From there it would be a slippery slope towards a large scale conflict between various Middle Eastern states and their allies around the globe. I guess my concern is that however peaceful Iran's intentions may be, Netanyahu clearly doesn't see it that way, and he could very well make the first move."

Or in other words: Israel knows what kind of shitstorm it would bring down upon itself if it were to attempt anything in the league of hostile military action.  Bibi has proven quite well, I think, that he's a lot more bark than bite when it comes to truly self-destructive stuff, and that he's well aware of his limits  For more, I turn to Brooking's Shibley Telhami (emphasis added):   [W]hile Netanyahu had been counting on Arab Gulf states who are genuinely concerned about rising Iranian power, the Obama administration outmaneuvered him in neutralizing strong Arab public opposition to a deal, helped by the Saudi entanglement in Yemen that rendered them more dependent on Washington, and by a sense that their faith that Bibi could stop a deal was misplaced."

I wouldn't be surprised at all either - I would expect, even - to see Israel actively antagonize Iran, not only at the bully pulpit, but in international forums and negotiations.  Personally I hope that this leads to Israel alienating every political ally it has, both at the nation-state level and at the individual diplomat level, and finally coming to its senses and realizing that it has to get its crap together.

The JCPOA is akin to Neville Chamberlain’s peace pact with Adolf Hitler, a delusional “peace for our time” moment. It rewards the transgressors of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Iranian hardliners.  There will be no peace. The JCPOA will only fuel the Daesh’s (the Islamic State) recruitment of extremist Sunni muslims to do battle against Iran’s export of extremist Shia muslim ideology and this battle will not be confined to the middle east.  According to the U.S. Institute of Peace, 60% of the Iranian population is under the age of 30. Without this JCPOA, the old guard hardliners of the Iranian revolution will either be dead or out of power in 15 years.

Whether something is a good deal depends on your perspective, so let's assume our primary interests are those of the American and Iranian people, rather than say the Saudi royals or US defense contractors.   I admit, I have not read that entire document. I did however try to search for the word ""Inspect"" and ""Inspection"" and ""Military""... and amazingly none of these words exist in the document. The word ""Verified"" is used twice.  So I guess, for anyone industrious enough to read the legalese, Can you determine how this applies to military installations that Iran has previously vowed would not be inspected?  This NYT review of the deal is all I have read;  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/15/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-deal-us.html?_r=1   Mr. Obama will be long out of office before any reasonable assessment can be made as to whether that roll of the dice paid off. The best guess today, even among the most passionate supporters of the president’s Iran project, is that the judgment will be mixed.  Little in the deal announced on Tuesday eliminates Iran’s ability to become a threshold nuclear power eventually — it just delays the day. To Mr. Obama’s many critics, including Henry A. Kissinger, the architect of the China opening, that is a fatal flaw. It does nothing, Mr. Kissinger wrote recently with another former secretary of state, George P. Shultz, to change “three and a half decades of militant hostility to the West.”   So far i haven't seen anything that indicates that the Iranian military will work with the IAEA, and I am still amazed that the words ""Inspect"" or ""Inspection"" or ""Military"" are never used one time in the document you linked us to.  EDIT: From your edit summary:   INSPECTIONS Monitors will be given extensive and regular access to Iran’s major nuclear sites for the next 25 years. Secretary of State John Kerry said that in some instances, the access is permanent. But Iran can delay requested inspections for 24 days, more than enough time, critics say, for Iran to clean up any evidence of illegal nuclear activities.   Yeah. This doesn't really seem to be anything but a feather stuck in the Obama Administration's cap."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,joatmon-snoo,-1,Wed Jul 15 07:58:48 2015 UTC,"Odd. I seem to see that the word 'inspect' is used seven times in the document in different forms like 'inspection' and 'inspector.' No 'military' however.  I haven't properly read the document either, but if you search for IAEA, most of those sections relate to inspections and verifications. There are 117 instances of IAEA in the text."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,Gnome_Sane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:10 2015 UTC,"Annex 1, section H, item 51:   The IAEA will establish a baseline for the amount of uranium legacy from past enrichment operations that will remain in Fordow. Iran will permit the IAEA regular access, including daily as requested by the IAEA, access to the FFEP in order to monitor Iran's production of stable isotopes and the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities at the FFEP for 15 years.   Annex 1, section P, item 71:   Iran will permit the IAEA regular access, including daily access as requested by the IAEA, to relevant buildings at Natanz, including all parts of the FEP and PFEP, for 15 years.   Here's where the 24 days stuff comes from:   If the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities or activities inconsistent with the JCPOA cannot be verified after the implementation of the alternative arrangements agreed by Iran and the IAEA, or if the two sides are unable to reach satisfactory arrangements to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities or activities inconsistent with the JCPOA at the specified locations within 14 days of the IAEA’s original request for access, Iran, in consultation with the members of the Joint Commission, would resolve the IAEA’s concerns through necessary means agreed between Iran and the IAEA. In the absence of an agreement, the members of the Joint Commission, by consensus or by a vote of 5 or more of its 8 members, would advise on the necessary means to resolve the IAEA's concerns. The process of consultation with, and any action by, the members of the Joint Commission would not exceed 7 days, and Iran would implement the necessary means within 3 additional days.

But American officials also acknowledged that after the first decade, the breakout time would begin to shrink. It was unclear how rapidly, because Iran’s longer-term plans to expand its enrichment capability will be kept confidential.  For example, it is not clear whether the inspectors would be able to interview the scientists and engineers who were believed to have been at the center of an effort by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to design a weapon that Iran could manufacture in short order."
NeutralPolitics,3da34g,cp5184,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:02:50 2015 UTC,"You say empty victory, I say substantial victory. International law and deal negotiation at this level, especially when dealing with an issue as thorny and with as far-reaching consequences as the one at hand, is incredibly difficult - it was a big victory when everyone agreed to stay at the table in the first place, to say nothing of the fact that at the end, we managed to stand up with a very long, very precise document.  Yes, it's unfortunate that we didn't get more concessions and that despite the agreement explicitly stipulates that the IAEA is allowed to inspect numerous nuclear facilities as frequently as on a daily basis, there are details that were missed. But how significant are these details: are you saying that because the agreement does not expressly discuss who the IAEA might interview and how, despite the powers it gives it to study Iran's nuclear capacity, we shouldn't have consented to it?  Regarding penalties for noncompliance, I turn to Vox (which has proven itself in recent times to be a remarkably astute source):   What happens next is that the United States, or one of the other countries that signed the Iran deal, can notify the special eight-member commission that supervises the enforcement of the agreement that it believes Iran has ""significantly"" violated the deal. (The commission includes the deal signatories: the US, UK, France, China, Russia, Iran itself, and the European Union.) That commission has 35 days to try to resolve the problem internally. But if it doesn't resolve it to everyone's satisfaction, then any of the parties to the Iran deal can send the violation to the UN Security Council and begin the ""snapback"" process that reinstates sanctions.  Once it's at the UN Security Council, there's a very unusual way the violation gets dealt with. To prevent sanctions from returning, the Security Council would have to pass a new resolution declaring that sanctions shouldn't be reinstated. If no resolution passes within 30 days, then the UN sanctions would ""snap back"" into place. In other words, the five permanent members of the Security Council have to all agree that Iran didn't do anything wrong — if just one thinks Iran broke the deal, sanctions will automatically come back.  This makes it really easy to reimpose sanctions if even just the United States thinks Iran is cheating on the deal. And it means that Russia and China — which have tended to support Iran's interests — wouldn't be able to block the return to sanctions.   Moreover, there's very little good reason for Iran to attempt to cheat: as Brooking's Shadi Hamid points out, this deal is something the Iranian people have been clamoring for for years now, and now that Rouhani's pulled through, it's highly unlikely that the theocracy will attempt to kill such a momentous deal - which, as CFR's Ray Takeyh aptly notes, legitimizes Iran's nuclear program - simply because of the internal backlash it would cause.  Frankly, because any violation on Iran's behalf would only bring us back to the status quo, I think the concerns that Richard Haass raises are much more significant.  Returning again to the point about an empty victory that you make, I invite you to think about it this way:  We have spent over a decade keeping Iran economically and politically isolated from the rest of the world in an attempt to pressure it into deweaponising. Not only has that policy failed, but it has also accomplished what everyone feared would happen: the Iranian people would be punished for the stubbornness of Iranian brass. This deal not only marks the redemption of this policy of isolation, as it proves that the US understands that the stick can go so far before using the carrot, but also that in the Middle East, where the US has proved itself utterly, absolutely, and fantastically incompetent time and time again, we can still make progress, and what's more, we can make progress with a nation that we've been openly and actively hostile with for years.  This is huge, precisely because of what it symbolizes. It isn't just that we signed a deal with Iran: it's that we signed a deal with Iran. We stayed at the table for over a year, and when we got up, no one was flipping tables or chairs, but we were shaking hands and smiling for photos. It's the Middle East, a part of the world to which no one has any good answers, a region to which most politicians are absolutely incapable of discussing apolitically and intelligently, and the fact that there's hope we can get an answer, an answer that we've proven we're willing to work and fight for, means the world is, quite literally, finally moving forward.  That's why it's significant."

NeutralPolitics,3da34g,overzealous_dentist,2,Thu Jul 16 01:55:58 2015 UTC,"This is long, because I'm actually addressing all of your arguments - something that I hope you can start doing, because believe it or not, I really am interested in figuring out your viewpoint - so bear with me:   An agreement that uses the words ""Inspect military programs"" for starters.   In what capacity? Are you arguing that in your hypothetical deal, Iran would have sacrificed its own dignity by allowing a foreign power to assess its military, one of the most fundamental aspects of sovereignty? I point you to Annex 1, Section Q (emphasis added):   74. Requests for access pursuant to provisions of this JCPOA will be made in good faith, with due observance of the sovereign rights of Iran, and kept to the minimum necessary to effectively implement the verification responsibilities under this JCPOA. In line with normal international safeguards practice, such requests will not be aimed at interfering with Iranian military or other national security activities, but will be exclusively for resolving concerns regarding fulfilment of the JCPOA commitments and Iran's other non-proliferation and safeguards obligations   Unless, of course, you're suggesting that we shouldn't be treating Iran as a nation, that we should shed ourselves of all pretense of civility and treat the country as little better than a savage dog to put down, and tell the international community we are so unambiguously arrogant that Iran should know better than to not prostate itself before the greatest country in the world.   That's right! Why should they? Obama was so desperate to sign this deal and claim victory, he is willing to not mention military inspections, give Iran 14 days to prep a site for inspection, and only interview the people they give permission to interview...   OK, now you're just straight up ignoring my comments. I'll quote the text of the agreement again:  Annex 1, section H, item:   51. The IAEA will establish a baseline for the amount of uranium legacy from past enrichment operations that will remain in Fordow. Iran will permit the IAEA regular access, including daily as requested by the IAEA, access to the FFEP in order to monitor Iran's production of stable isotopes and the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities at the FFEP for 15 years.   Annex 1, section N:   67. Iran will permit the IAEA the use of on-line enrichment measurement and electronic seals which communicate their status within nuclear sites to IAEA inspectors, as well as other IAEA approved and certified modern technologies in line with internationally accepted IAEA practice. Iran will facilitate automated collection of IAEA measurement recordings registered by installed measurement devices and sending to IAEA working space in individual nuclear sites. 67.  Iran will make the necessary arrangements to allow for a long-term IAEA presence, including issuing long-term visas, as well as providing proper working space at nuclear sites and, with best efforts, at locations near nuclear sites in Iran for the designated IAEA inspectors for working and keeping necessary equipment   Annex 1, section P:   71. Iran will permit the IAEA regular access, including daily access as requested by the IAEA, to relevant buildings at Natanz, including all parts of the FEP and PFEP, for 15 years.   Annex 1, section Q (emphasis added):   78. If the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities or activities inconsistent with the JCPOA cannot be verified after the implementation of the alternative arrangements agreed by Iran and the IAEA, or if the two sides are unable to reach satisfactory arrangements to verify the absence of undeclared nuclear materials and activities or activities inconsistent with the JCPOA at the specified locations within 14 days of the IAEA’s original request for access, Iran, in consultation with the members of the Joint Commission, would resolve the IAEA’s concerns through necessary means agreed between Iran and the IAEA. In the absence of an agreement, the members of the Joint Commission, by consensus or by a vote of 5 or more of its 8 members, would advise on the necessary means to resolve the IAEA's concerns. The process of consultation with, and any action by, the members of the Joint Commission would not exceed 7 days, and Iran would implement the necessary means within 3 additional days.   You say Iran has ""14 days to prep a site for inspection"": this is not the case. 1-Q-78 gives Iran time after inspections turn up something fishy to prove that it isn't cooking the books, it isn't giving Iran time to cook the books. As the agreement makes quite clear, inspection stipulations are quite clear.   No, you didn't. No one reviewing this on any side of the isle says it has any teeth... only you.   Evidently you don't consider snapbacks sufficient teeth: what would count as teeth, then?   Well of course we do.... Acording to president Obama if Iran cheats they get the flow of cash from easing sanctions and they reach ""breakout status"" within 1 year. This is from Obama himself. What do we have to lose by not taking this agreement?  But again - what is the harm in no deal and leaving sanctions in place?   The harm is that there's simply no way to move forward. Sanctions are a very dangerous card to play, because they're quite literally a trump card: once you play it, you can't play it again. If you can't use sanctions to make them fold, then keeping them up simply aren't going to work. Iran has demonstrated incredible resilience against sanctions - notably, with the help of powers such as China and Russia, who, as you've already aptly noted, have little good reason to side with us on the issue - and has proven, time and time again, that ""increased"" sanctions have absolutely no effect.  Power, at an international level, is generally classified twofold: soft and hard. Soft power is diplomatic isolation, economic punishment, blacklists; using sanctions exhausts all soft power. Hard power, by comparison, is everything that soft power is not: actual military force.  The longer we keep sanctions up, the longer Iran has to figure out how to thrive under the sanctions, which leaves hard power as the only option on the table - something that I don't think is exactly viable, given our track record in the Middle East. This deal allows us to recoup the soft power that we spent applying sanctions.   Well of course we do.... Acording to president Obama if Iran cheats they get the flow of cash from easing sanctions and they reach ""breakout status"" within 1 year.   And that cash flow is also exactly what we can expect will keep Iran from cheating: as I think you're aware, opening trade barriers doesn't mean we're funneling cash into the coffers of the Iranian government. It means goods and services crossing the Iranian borders in exchange for cold, hard cash, which the government can siphon from in the form of tariffs, taxes, and whatnot: and once you get this much money moving across international borders, you find interest groups springing up everywhere to ensure the status quo, to make sure that Iran doesn't do something as absolutely boneheaded as burning the agreement, the only thing which is keeping its borders open."

Why? Because traces of uranium, traces of any kind of fissile material are traceable and are very, very hard to get rid of.  If they are afraid of us having entry because we might find something years later, I can assure you our intelligence community is completely comfortable that 24 days is not enough time for them to be able to evade our technical means, our capacity to observe, our ability to be able to know what is happening.   While Kerry makes some sense... the idea that everything related to developing nukes - the drawings and computers and data and development of delivery systems... the idea that all of that is always in contact with uranium and leaves a trail is laughable at best.   as I think you're aware, opening trade barriers doesn't mean we're funneling cash into the coffers of the Iranian government.

The idea that you give someone everything they want in hopes they do what you want is not just bad strategy...   It is far, far from giving Iran everything they want. Now you're just being facetious.   It doesn't matter how toothless or bad the deal is.   I ask again: what counts as teeth?   Right - it's 24 days...   OK, I'll concede this one, but as Kerry also points out in the article you link:   An example -- and nobody's paid enough attention to this -- we will have television cameras and live tracking of their centrifuge production for 20 years. We will have tracking of their mining of any uranium whatsoever in Iran for 25 years, from the mine, to the mill, to the yellow cake, to the gas, to the centrifuge and to the waste.  We have unprecedented ability to see what they are doing. And our intelligence community tells us that, for them to have a covert path, they would have to have an entire fuel cycle that is covert, and that is impossible to do so with the regime that we have put together.   You also say:   While Kerry makes some sense... the idea that everything related to developing nukes - the drawings and computers and data and development of delivery systems... the idea that all of that is always in contact with uranium and leaves a trail is laughable at best.   Have you ever done any hardware development work? It's an impressive armchair expert who can claim to know better than an international negotiator, armed with the wealth of the United States and its nuclear resources, and argue that it's possible to develop any kind of technology, let alone weaponised nuclear resources, using only theoretical work.  Hardware development is fucking hard. You have to constantly iterate, constantly unit test, constantly prove minimum viable product and proof of concept. I don't know what kind of work you do, but let's say Iran's goal, instead of building a nuke, was building a car engine. Your argument is that although Iran isn't allowed to perform any physical work with the aims of building a car engine, that it's possible for them to develop a digital model of all cylinders, of all pistons, of all fluid seals, of all lubrication, and all the interacting static and dynamic forces without even the slightest idea of how well any individual parts might work.     as I think you're aware, opening trade barriers doesn't mean we're funneling cash into the coffers of the Iranian government.   No. I don't agree with you here at all either.   This isn't a question of whether you ""agree"" or not.

NeutralPolitics,3d99hg,teerre,17,Tue Jul 14 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"As someone with some academic training in economics, I believe I can provide some insight into the issue. The costs of regulations tend to be thinly dispersed over a wide number of people, usually in the form of slightly higher costs, prices etc. Meanwhile, the costs on non-regulation are typically more concentrated or at least much more visible: industrial accidents and injuries, food poisoning, financial meltdowns. And it's simply much easier to rally around more visible and seemingly more powerful incidents, even if the cumulative cost of the regulation is greater than the harm it would prevent.   This is not to say that regulation is a net bad, as certain people would have you believe: there certainly are plenty of cases of regulation that is a net benefit. But you can't get people to rally around getting rid of, say, some excessive food regulation that costs the average consumer $10 per year dispersed over most food purchases (the estimated cost of sugar subsidies and import restrictions, according to this story)--it simply isn't noticeable at all."

NeutralPolitics,3ck1hi,CC440,20,Wed Jul 8 16:49:18 2015 UTC,FactCheck is mostly neutral with the exception of a few topics but PolitiFact is straight trash.  I see bias in the way FactCheck frames the fact in question. They reframe the wuestion as a strawman and point their answer towards that interpretation instead of the core issue. PolitiFact does this with practically everything so FactCheck shines by comparison but it's still there depending on the author and subject matter.
NeutralPolitics,3ck1hi,designated_shitter,21,Wed Jul 8 18:14:29 2015 UTC,"The other problem I have with them is what I call the ""NPR ruffle no feathers, view from nowhere"" aspect.  They stick SOLELY to the fact check, in very milquetoast terms of ""So and so said this, and it is not true based on x.""  They rarely contextualize things concerning why someone would say x, and what the stakes are—because sometimes whether or not someone is lying isn't as important as why, or what the content of the lie is."
NeutralPolitics,3ck1hi,CC440,20,Wed Jul 8 19:04:14 2015 UTC,"Good point, they also emulate NPR in the way they ignore certain questions of great importance to the topic at hand. They'll fact check the presentation of objective data and ignore the context in which it's being used. I've seen this used (but I can't think of a direct example on FactCheck) when facts surrounding the issue of gun control are brought up. A general example would be correlating the total number of gun deaths in the context of violent crime. That's ""untrue"""" IMO as it misleads the listener to believe the problem is more than twice as large as it is in reality. A deeper look at the data woukd show that suicides account for 60% of all gun deaths in the US. That fact would be left unchecked by FactCheck or checked against face value and said to be true if we're talking about PolitiFact.  While we're on the topic of NPR's ""ruffle no feathers"" approach, I about punch through my radio every time a Defense/Security Agency official is interviewed on one of their shows. The host/journalist always soft shoes the topic, refusing to press obvious lies with follow up questions. I remember one where an official was asked about spying on their congressional oversight board, responded with a flat ""no"", ending that topic of discussion. This was not long after it was proven that they had accessed the board member's computers. Frustrating."
NeutralPolitics,3ck1hi,designated_shitter,17,Wed Jul 8 19:30:52 2015 UTC,"Great point about the cherry picked data.  Sometimes you need to throw a bunch of other stuff in to make the fact check worthy of being checked at all, and they don't always do that. Building on your criticism of NPR, what kills me is how they have fallen into the he said/she said style of political reporting in order to be ""balanced,"" but they never give any fucking context to WHY they're both saying what they're saying.  I don't give a shit what Lyndsey Graham or Harry Reid have to say about any topic, ever:  what are the actual policies they are crafting, what are the games they're playing, why, and what is the likely outcome?  Christ."

For instance their article on the Clinton Foundation as it relates to Charity Navigator at http://www.factcheck.org/2015/06/where-does-clinton-foundation-money-go/  If you just read the factcheck.org article you'd assume the matter was concluded but what they're not showing you is this:  http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/clinton-foundation-battles-charity-watchdog/article/2564332  Notice that Charity Navigator came out with it's statement about the CF trying to strongarm them on 5/12 and yet factcheck didn't include that in their analysis dated 6/23!  That's the kind of subtle non-neutrality that you have to watch out for with factcheck. It often doesn't completely invalidate their conclusion but it does make you wonder what else they're conveniently leaving out.

In the link you posted.   ""We had previously evaluated this organization, but have since determined that this charity's atypical business model can not be accurately captured,"" Charity Navigator wrote of the Clinton Foundation, which it reportedly added to its list of suspicious philanthropies March 13.   That isn't the full quote from Charity Navigator. This is the full quote:   We had previously evaluated this organization, but have since determined that this charity's atypical business model can not be accurately captured in our current rating methodology. Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity. We reserve the right to reinstate a rating for The Clinton Foundation as soon as we identify a rating methodology that appropriately captures its business model.

A sourced claim by someone who would know that the C.F. attempted to strongarm their way OFF the list...information vital to understanding that was left out of the FC analysis.

On the otherside if Obama said the sky was blue they'd mark it as ""Misleading"" and give counter examples of when it isn't blue, while if Romney had called the sky pink he'd have been labeled as ""Somewhat True"" because in some cases the sky can be pink.

Or a biased readership for those that take suggestions on what to fact check?), then justify that by pointing out that they hand out more ""bad"" ratings to the one they check more, so obviously they need to check him more because he's a bigger liar.  When the first guy might get a pass based on the initial sample.  Not saying it happened in the Romney/Obama race (though I'm of the opinion that the only way to tell if a politician is lying is whether his mouth is moving), but it's very possible for selection biases to form an echo chamber."

Some issues have many more than two sides. Some issues have multiple sides but one of those sides is so accepted and dominant that there is really only one acceptable opinion for all intents and purposes.   Anyone who asks if a factchecking service has a bias is doing their due diligence. Anyone who asks for a specific left/right bias probably has an agenda and more to the point one side of the political spectrum is a lot more likely to see a political bias than the other.

Your own internal bias is shown by referring to felons coming out of prison as high risk individuals in general, with only a subset looking to turn their lives around. Changing only housing rules in a vacuum would not be a solution because the felon still has substantial deprivation of rights. He has trouble working since he has to disclose the prior conviction. He cannot vote.   What this comes down to really is ""Are felons high risk people to have participate in society after release from prison?""  Answering that question should lead to answers to subquestions, including about housing."

The success story cited in the article is about an organization slowly convincing the local community to support them, and getting them involved.   Conversely one of the largest hurdles stated, is communities as well (along with the local governments that appeal to them, and provide laws to help keep convicts out of their neighborhoods).:   Even if funds were readily available and organizations had the skills it takes to build and/or manage reentry housing, local opposition poses a continual problem to siting facilities. Even within ex-offender home communities, fear of increased crime and decreased property values keep potential neighbors from wanting to house ex-offenders in their backyard. This has driven many local governments to legally prohibit arrangements most conducive to reentry housing by zoning out multifamily buildings, group living facilities and/or social services. Furthermore, strong redevelopment pressures within gentrifying cities make it difficult to access land and site facilities. Government has little motivation to cooperate with nonprofits serving ex-offender populations when private developers are clamoring for permits for projects that will bring upper-income residents and businesses into historically declining urban cores.   IMO getting communities to vote against the zoning laws mentioned, would be easier than convincing them to accept more housing facilities for ex-convicts."

Under the Martin-Quinn method, justices receive a score on a one-dimensional scale that runs from liberal to conservative, with negative values representing liberal justices and positive values representing conservative ones.       Researchers have carefully analyzed the judicial rulings of the Supreme Court – the votes and written opinions of the justices – as well as their upbringing, their political party affiliation, their speeches, editorials written about them at the time of their Senate confirmation, and the political climate in which they are appointed, confirmed, and work.[3] From this data, scholars have inferred the ideological leanings of each justice and how the justices are likely to vote on upcoming cases.  Using statistical analysis of Supreme Court votes, scholars found that an inferred value representing a Justice's ideological preference on a simple conservative–liberal scale is sufficient to predict a large number of that justice's votes.   Their job is to interpret the constitution and confirm that laws passed by congress are compatible.

Check out this quote:   Most dramatically, of course, in back-to-back decisions last week, the Court dismissed another legal challenge to Obama’s health care reform law, and declared that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. But in other important cases as well, liberals prevailed. The Court found that the Fair Housing Act prohibits housing policies that adversely affect racial minorities, even when there is no discriminatory intent; ruled for the Alabama Black Caucus in a challenge to racial gerrymandering; upheld Arizona’s independent redistricting commission, designed to limit partisan districting; protected speech rights on the Internet; sustained campaign finance restrictions in judicial elections; and eased the standard for victims of excessive force in the nation’s jails. And in cases that did not even present these issues, Justice Kennedy wrote an impassioned separate opinion denouncing prolonged solitary confinement, and Justice Breyer wrote a forty-page dissent laying out a powerful case against the death penalty. Both opinions invited future constitutional challenges.  The conservatives did win several notable cases. Among them, they rejected a challenge to Oklahoma’s lethal injection execution regime, and ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency has to take costs into account in assessing whether to regulate power plant emissions. But these decisions do not come close to the term’s liberal outcomes in their significance.   All these seem to me like focusing on the political spectrum rather than judicial."

The privileges or immunities clause, particularly, was largely read out of the constitution by the reconstruction-era court. But if you're really interested in the original meaning of the 14th amendment , it strikes me that the Obergefell decision is quite consistent with that original intent to protect citizens against injustices done by the states (though not with Jutice Taney's deliberate misreading). That said, you can see why the court would be more split--in terms of basic legal reasoning--over whether the constitution protects gay marriage than interracial marriage."
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,eamul,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:09:52 2015 UTC,"Before Roberts was a SCOTUS justice, he worked pro bono on Romer v. Evans, a landmark case in which an anti-gay law was struck down under the 14th Amendment.  So that clearly isn't his position - his arguments are far more nuanced and, frankly, far more tenuous than that.  He agrees that there is a fundamental right to marriage under the due process clause, but says that it doesn't apply to gay people because reasons.  He agrees that the equal protection clause precludes anti-gay laws unless there is a good reason for them, but thinks that merely wanting to discriminate against gay people is a good reason for doing it (when it comes to marriage at least).  I don't really understand why people are so desperate to defend the dissenting opinions in this case.  Sometimes judges just want to impose their own political views on people and write opinions that are nothing more than flimsy excuses to do so.  It is extremely difficult to square Supreme Court precedent on marriage and discrimination with the view that states can ban same-sex marriage (though to be fair to Thomas, he does disagree with much of that precedent)."

Additionally, the 14th amendment intended for protecting blacks, but that isn't how it was written. I'd guess the vagueness was at least somewhat intentional.   No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,thebhgg,2,Tue Jul 7 08:54:56 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't judges be removed if they have strong political leanings?   That's a value-based question, and I'm curious why you have imbedded the presumption of ""Yes, they should"" into the wording.  I'd say judges who can't accept laws passed by legislatures because of their partisan perspective are bad jurists.  So perhaps we are in complete agreement.  However, my first reading of your phrase ""strong political leanings"" lead me to think about what a jurist without any political leanings would look like.  I'd guess that would be someone who doesn't really read or care about history or political science, which would make understanding the context of the words used in the laws hard to interpret.  I mean, on face value the phrase ""all men are created equal"" has the (laughably inapplicable) meaning ""men are fungible""; after all, equal objects can be substituted for each other in mathematical equations.  A little context helps dismiss that interpretation.   The system has worked for a little while in the US (we are only 226 years old) and probably still has some legs in it.  We have not really celebrated jurists who have had no political impact in the past (have we?) so I kinda think you should try to justify excluding jurists who do have political interests.  Though, to be clear, I don't think political justifications for judicial decisions have much merit.  Even Scalia doesn't use justifications like, ""this court's finding supports the Democratic Party, and so, despite it's compelling logic, I cannot support it""  (though you may find a distinction between partisan and political useful in telling me I've just used a strawman.

If you define marriage as a male and female thing, then only, by definition, can a male and female get married (it is the only possible state within the definition).

Now, if you change the definition to ""the union of any 2 consenting adults regardless of sex"" and then the gov't makes a law that only recognizes heterosexual unions as marriage, then you can make the argument of sexism against this law because, in this scenario, the question ""why can't Bob marry Jon?"" makes sense (it is an actual, possible thing to happen within the definition of marriage). Bob can marry Susan and not Jon, that's sexist because both scenarios are possible within the definition, but one is being made illegal."

One of the main arguments in favour of same-sex marriage is that sexual orientation should also be regarded as a suspect or quasi-suspect status (if you accept that, then it becomes extremely difficult to argue against SSM).  The factors that the court uses to decide which classifications are suspect are:   immutability history of discrimination and stigma political powerlessness the trait does not prevent people from being valuable members of society   It is very difficult to argue that those points apply to religious minorities more strongly than they apply to sexual minorities."

How any concludes from an *ahem* originalist reading of that that it might not plausibly pertain to all persons, regardless, I can't imagine.  I mean, I can fully understand that argument that there was oppression of blacks in the 1860s, so that must have been considered an exception, and for whatever reason was just not mentioned in so many words -- because, I don't know, 'duh' maybe?

It is not the business or proper right of courts to invent new laws, or new interpretations of laws -- one of the very things that Scalia and I consistently agree on. But the court that ruled Loving interpreted existing law to defend a fundamental right to marriage, and so did the majority here. To follow Scalia's own reasoning, if The People disagreed, they've had more than ample opportunity since 1967 to clarify that through amendment. That they have not would appear to prove adequate popular support for the earlier finding, and that must inherently also defend this one.   It should be an open and shut case.   I had [this](It should be an open and shut case.) in the back of my mind the last few months. (Warning: Strong language.) It seems silly, even a bit immature, but I can't help wanting to share it now.  I certainly hoped for a unanimous ruling, but knew better than to predict one. I figured the conservative wing of the court would grudgingly see reason. Or at worst, would offer some thoughtful criticisms about the majority's approach.

It's fine to be judicially conservative but it's hypocrisy when that only applies to laws and cases they oppose on a personal political level. They've also seemed completely oblivious to predicting the real world implications of their decisions, see also Citizens United where everything opponents of that decision said would happen have and then some all while continuing to deny it was happening.   On another note, it takes a whole special case of cognitive dissonance for Clarence Thomas to rule against this case considering his own marriage is only legal because of the Loving ruling. You'd think he of all people might notice the similarity of the two cases.

So much so that it might be rather intrinsic to the property of being religious—most religious claims are exclusive: adherence to one disqualifies one from adherence to another—even if they aren't an intrinsic trait.  There's a good pragmatic reason for freedom of religion: it is a useful way to keep angry religious nutters in check. If you can say to the Baptists ""hey, look, you can do your Baptists thing so long as you let the Catholics and the Methodists and the Jews do likewise"", that is a reasonably good way to stop religious conflict.  The broader point though—that religion is a lot easier to change than either race or sexual orientation (as both Rachel Dolezal and the ineffectiveness of pray away the gay camps prove)—is true. Like, people will change religious adherence for all sorts of bullshit reasons like they've gotten married to someone of that denomination, or that to succeed in business in some small town in rural America, you need to go to the right church to get the right connections."

That there's a long history of people we'd now describe as GSMs is no more relevant to the point than that there's a long history of people we'd now describe as PoC. Similarly, the genetic, epigenetic, and other developmental factors that correlate with identifying as / being considered gay in the US make it no less intrinsic than the genetic factors that correlate with identifying as / being considered Asian in the US.  Besides, I think parent's point is mostly orthogonal to that debate because the public at large certainly perceives sexuality as less innate than race."

Though not referenced immediately there, the long and the short of it is that the notion of sexual orientation as an identity was originally promulgated by gays, but first emerged as a paradigm as a means to be more effectively oppress them.  In both cases, a major motive was political: It's much easier to act in respect to people than acts. (E.g., a person who kills is a murderer, one who rapes a rapist, one who steals a thief, and so on. These identifying terms are not essential to laws against acts, but socially vital labels telling us how to regard and treat others.) In our own time, there's a slowly growing movement towards eventual deconstruction of sexual orientation as identity -- one I welcome and support, personally, but also recognise as irrationally anathema to critical milestones such as this recent ruling. In some ways, the majority ruling is compatible with the deconstructionist view, but politically it's still very hard to simultaneously argue that gays deserve equal rights and are not really gay people as a discrete identity. Gay identity is a predominantly political concept, formed for political purposes, and in some ways must remain so for as long as political conflict over it exists."

NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,qpdbag,2,Tue Jul 7 04:47:27 2015 UTC,"There's no definitive genetic set that would be the ""black genes"", ""white genes"", ""middle eastern genes"".  There's some things which are common within certain races more than others, but it definitely wasn't the case that races were defined by genetics when we first constructed the term and we've never taken the time to re-evaluate our definitions to conform to genetics.    If it were based on genetics, we would probably have a better consensus as to how many races there are.  Is Asian a single race?  The genetic differences between Koreans and Indians is huge, and so's Indian and Thai. This happens with every race.  Don't get me wrong, race as a cultural construct suffers from these issues as well.   But that's okay, culture can be loosey goosey like that.  Genetics?  If it's based on genetics we should be able to point to a set of genes and say they're the genes of a certain race, and we can't.  And the more globalized we become, the muddier things will become.  Brazil has already mostly integrated three-four races in just a few generations."
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,PoopyToes,9,Mon Jul 6 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"Nothing you have said is false except your inferring that a lack of distinct gene sets equals that genetics is not a factor. Of course there are no such ""black"" or ""white"" genes or even a subset of such genes. The vast majority of biological functions are tied to, not one or a few, but a large network of interacting genes and variation in expression levels of said genes.  Genetic history is absolutely tied to how we biologically function and appear. That's kind of what the field of genetics is.  Maybe I'm being pedantic but to state that race has nothing to do with genetics implies a misunderstanding of biology or some other facet I'm not considering."

It's unimportant, and exists only because we're describing living things and attributes of their being aliveness.  Its relevance begins and ends with the fact that we're discussing sexually linked communities and genetics happens to be how this reproduction occurs.  I feel like it's as important as sex -- race is all about sex, c'mon man without sex there's no race.  At the most human base of it all, it's all about sloppy, sweaty sex and if it weren't it wouldn't be about genetics.  But race isn't about sex.  When people talk about ""race"" and what it is and why it's a thing, no one's talking about doing it.    When people say ""race"" and they're not talking about a competition, they're usually talking about cultural traits or a very non-genetic-based set of physical traits.

NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,SlimSlamtheFlimFlam,10,Tue Jul 7 01:14:01 2015 UTC,"Whereas race has nothing to do with genetics.   I wouldn't go so far as to say nothing, I mean, there aren't any significant genetic differences overall, it's more differences in the expression or commonness of certain gene variants. A great example: the relative distribution of blood group A versus blood group B. Research is still very much in its infancy, though we have already discovered how certain blood types can affect susceptibility to various diseases and other things (examples: Rh blood group, Kell antigen system, Lewis antigen system, ABO blood group).   Another (perhaps more obvious :) ) example is skin color, which, when darker, reduces the amount of UVB light absorbed (and resultant damage), which is particularly beneficial for populations living near the equator. The converse is also true, with lighter skin, more UVB rays are absorbed. It's natural selection at work. (One cool exception to this are the Inuit, one hypothesis as to how they get away with having darker skin while living so far north is that they obtain most of their needed vitamin D from their traditional fish-rich diet).  All this has more to do with populations than race though (so I guess my wall of text is for nothing! ;) ). Case in point: sub-Saharan Africa has more human genetic diversity than anywhere else on the planet.  This can have implications in medicine, too. For instance, males with African heritage are more likely to develop end-stage renal disease as a complication of high blood pressure compared to other groups having the same blood pressure. There is some evidence that certain classes of antihypertensive medications are more effective in people with African or Carribean heritage, to the point where certain classes of medications (calcium channel blockers) are recommended as first-line treatment in UK guidelines over other classes of drugs.  Plus, expression of certain drug-metabolizing enzymes can vary widely between populations (example: CYP2D6, which metabolizes roughly 25% of all current pharmaceuticals), which can have a huge impact on both effectiveness, side effects, and toxicity of those medications.  Didn't mean to go on for so long, but felt it would be useful to share. Here's an interesting Wiki article for those interested: human genetic variation.  The more you know★"

Sexual identity and classification, both by oneself and by the society one is embedded in, closely tracks the presence and absence of certain of physiological traits.

Some people say that gay identity is solely defined by sexual orientation. But there's more to being gay than just being a dude who likes dudes. What about gay culture? Sure, not every gay person is into gay culture.  But lots of people are. There's lots of people who are writing and thinking about this now: why exactly are gay men so fascinated by drag queens and by Judy Garland and Madonna and Lady Gaga and Mommie Dearest and Grey Gardens? Or opera or The Golden Girls or Beyoncé? Just why are the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy guys so fucking queeny and annoying?  You don't have to like gay culture to see that it's a thing.  As is gay identity and the gay/queer scene. I was shocked when I found out that my now-ex-boyfriend had lived in London for four years and had never been to a gay bar here.

Sexuality is a basic attraction, we as humans simply want to get off, over time we develop particular ways to get off based on our personal experience, but to say that one has the genetic programing of attraction to men, women, fat people, skinny people, animals or whatever is simply illogical. We cultivate our sexuality over time by either actively or passively pursuing it.  beside that I think there is a great argument for banning racial discrimination whilst preserving sexual discrimination ability. Specifically because race is a social construct, or a lie that has been propagated over time, it is a meaningless thing. Sexuality is an action, we actively pursue our sexuality. Discriminating based on ones actions seems perfectly fine in a society that condones free speech, freedom of opinion/thought and freedom of association.  We cant control the color we were born, and it has no bearing on anything. We can control the actions we make and good or bad our actions actively have some affect on the world around us, thus discrimination based on actions is a viable way to discriminate."

Today’s decree says that my Ruler, and the Ruler of 320 million Americans coast-to-coast, is a majority of the nine lawyers on the Supreme Court. The opinion in these cases is the furthest extension in fact— and the furthest extension one can even imagine—of the Court’s claimed power to create “liberties” that the Constitution and its Amendments neglect to mention. This practice of constitutional revision by an unelected committee of nine, always accompanied (as it is today) by extravagant praise of liberty, robs the People of the most important liberty they asserted in the Declaration of Independence and won in the Revolution of 1776: the freedom to govern themselves.    So essentially this is an argument against a supreme court that ...in effect... took an issue out of the public discourse and the governing processes that govern it, and settled the matter. Nine unelected judges unaccountable to the people decided what should and shouldn't be law via this decision. I think most would agree thats not exactly in the spirit of democracy. He says as much here:   Until the courts put a stop to it, public debate over same-sex marriage displayed American democracy at its best. Individuals on both sides of the issue passionately, but respectfully, attempted to persuade their fellow citizens to accept their views. Americans considered the arguments and put the question to a vote. The electorates of 11 States, either directly or through their representatives, chose to expand the traditional definition of marriage. Many more decided not to.1 Win or lose, advocates for both sides continued pressing their cases, secure in the knowledge that an electoral loss can be negated by a later electoral win. That is exactly how our system of government is supposed to work.    Now more to your question. He talks about the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, and how it applies here. Keep in mind that the 14th Amendment is in large part the basis for what the majority opinion argued.    When it comes to determining the meaning of a vague constitutional provision—such as “due process of law” or “equal protection of the laws”—it is unquestionable that the People who ratified that provision did not understand it to prohibit a practice that remained both universal and uncontroversial in the years after ratification. We have no basis for striking down a practice that is not expressly prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment’s text, and that bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use dating back to the Amendment’s ratification. Since there is no doubt whatever that the People never decided to prohibit the limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples, the public debate over same-sex marriage must be allowed to continue.    What he is saying in the preceeding quote is important. There are many examples in constitutional law (actually law in general) where there may be vagueries in the interpretation of particular statutes or phrases. In these cases we look at the evidence of how the people who actually wrote the law interpreted it as a standard for what they meant. The federalist papers are a famous example, where the intents of the founders for what made it into the constitution is supposed to mean. In other words, since the people who wrote the 14th amendment didn't interpret this to include issues relating to marriage, then there is no historical or legal basis for such an extension of the law. By this argument (which, in full disclosure, I find persuasive), then the LEGAL BASIS of both interracial marriage and gay marriage bans are not legitimate, and should not be based off of the 14th amendment.   He makes the argument that these laws instead should   (essentially) be based off of other lawful provisions layed out in the constitution like amending the constitution, or leaving it on the legal basis of the 9th and 10th amendments.   He says   But the Court ends this debate, in an opinion lacking even a thin veneer of law. Buried beneath the mummeries and straining-to-be-memorable passages of the opinion is a candid and startling assertion: No matter what it was the People ratified, the Fourteenth Amendment protects those rights that the Judiciary, in its “reasoned judgment,” thinks the Fourteenth Amendment ought to protect.13 That is so because “[t]he generations that wrote and ratified the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment did not presume to know the extent of freedom in all of its dimensions . . . . ”14 One would think that sentence would continue: “. . . and therefore they provided for a means by which the People could amend the Constitution,” or perhaps “. . . and therefore they left the creation of additional liberties, such as the freedom to marry someone of the same sex, to the People, through the never-ending process of legislation.” But no. What logically follows, in the majority’s judge-empowering estimation, is: “and so they entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning.""   So there he just made the argument that instead of being legally based on the 14th ammendment, it should instead be legally reserved to the processes of either constitutional ammendment or to the 9th and 10th ammendments. This is an important distinction, because in the former case it takes power away from people and the states in a way that sets a legal precedent, and in the ladder cases it reserves these powers and liberties to the normal political processes through voting and legislation. let me say that again, thats a very important distinction.   Futhermore, then why did the original court decide on interracial marriage 9-0, while this one was only 5-4? This is actually simpler than you would think. As other have pointed out, today's court is more ""conservative"", whereas the court that decided interracial marriage was much more liberal. (I wont repost others links on that, check it out yourself in the other comments). This forms the basis of why there was any dissent in the first place. ""conservative"" justices have a legal philosophy where they interpret the law literally and as it was intended. You may sometimes hear about ""originalist"" interpretations of the constitution sometimes in the media. This is what they are talking about. Opposite of that is a legal philosophy proposed by liberal justices that is colloquially known by the phrase ""a living breathing document"". This philosophy is characterized by not being necessarily being constrained by the letter of the law or the intents by those who wrote it, but rather by the ""changing needs and conditions"" of society. It basically means that as society changes and moves forward, justices have the privilege of ""reinterpreting"" the law to fit society as they see fit. The orginalists of the court hate this, and the Warren court that decided interracial marriage was the last time we had a strongly liberal supreme court. Hence the discrepancy.  TLDR: basically the original court that decided interracial marriage took a liberal interpretation of the constitution, and it also happened to be populated almost entirely by liberals at the time, whereas today you have a conservative...but more balanced, court.   Edit: I should probably also add in full disclosure that I also support gay marriage. I'm a libertarian kind of guy, and I think that prohibitions on gay marriage is the exact sort of thing that illustrates the problem with the ""tyranny of the majority"". However, I also believe that the majority opinion based their legal arguments on unfortunate grounds since IMHO as well as the dissenting opinions, it takes sets a dangerous precedent that displaces the power from the people and the states to settle these matters (through the 9th and 10th amendments), and instead places it purely within the purview of the unelected and unaccountable supreme court (in the sense that they don't face the voters). On top of that, it does so by expanding the ""legal"" authority of the government through a very shaky ""reinterpretation"" of the 14th amendment to discover a right that the authors clearly never intended. Simply because they did it for a laudable goal does not mean that it is ok to have done so in this manner since it harms the integrity of the constitution, which is clearly an important side effect of this type of judicial activism that can lead to unintended consequences."

NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,sylban,22,Wed Jul 8 09:09:13 2015 UTC,"he officially is on the record as not having much of a problem with gay marriage in and of itself.   He's also lying when he says this, unfortunately. He's very smart and clever, and it takes some time and study to realize how much he bends and twists the truth -- a lot more often than is at first apparent -- to suit his immediate purposes. I leave it to you to do your own research on things he has said in the past about gays,  homosexuality, and gay rights, but they are commonly ugly and very demeaning. He does have a problem with it. This statement is a lie. Stating it as boldly and shamelessly as he does is part of his rhetorical wizardry. Unless you've made a study of him, most of what he says is immediately convincing for its confident tone alone. But if you read enough of what he's said, you won't fall for it.  Scallia has been on the anti-gay side in every single Supreme Court case regarding gay rights. Every. Single. One. How is it that the law always falls that way for him? It's probably not because it has no personal meaning to him.  The next bit you cite is hysterical hyperbole so over the top that it would not be out of place in cringe forums. You'd think we'd just re-enacted slavery from the way he's talking.  Again, I advise reading a lot more about him, and especially by him. He never raises these garment-rending concerns when he's in the majority.  More pointedly, perhaps, the most logical conclusion to draw from this bit of panic is that there should be no Supreme Court, or perhaps any courts. But I must have missed the story about him submitting his resignation from that high office.  In the third cite, curiously -- and a little troubling -- he seems to be arguing that as long as there is a political process in motion, no judicial action is merited (or justified). By that logic, though, as above, no judicial action is merited ever, since the political process never stops being available. From my perspective, this particular bit is carefully calculated as an attempt to differentiate the Court's (presumably appropriate) intervention in 1967, after no more states had repealed antimiscegenation laws since 1948. It argues that the court should (or must) wait out the political process. How long? He does not say.  But this is not a legal argument in any case. He's only expression a viewpoint. (And one I don't personally believe he really holds, just one that's convenient to his immediate position.)  It's almost laughable that he attacks the majority's pro-gay interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, given that the exact same interpretation -- in almost exactly the same words -- was the basis of the 1967 ruling that overturned antimiscegenation -- which was also ""a practice that remained both universal and uncontroversial in the years after ratification"" -- for a whole century in fact.  The only logical way to interpret this is that Loving was also an invalid ruling. Who here finds that a reasonable conclusion? Either Loving and Obergefell are both valid, or neither is. He can't have it both ways. But he's sure as hell trying to.  Scalia is an originalist, which is already a very shaky minority legal philosophy. Or at least he claims to be. After reading enough of his opinions, by now I find myself unconvinced that he adheres to any particular philosophy other than the smug presumption that he must be right, and the law must agree with him. I'm sorry, but I long ago lost faith that he is a wholly honest man and an appropriately impartial jurist. He is highly intelligent, and has mastered the art of bending the law to his will. And as you've aptly demonstrated, he's equally masterful at shaping other people's perspectives.  Nothing so mystical or esoteric as he claims is behind this court's divide on this. Race is plainly obvious, and disputable. It's just plain wrong for anyone to be treated differently because of it. The court in 1967 could never have reached any other conclusion, and not only because any other conclusion would have meant legal chaos, since you can't disallow married couples the right to travel between states.  What drove the divide here is something the dissent cannot publicly admit: They believe gay people choose to be gay, and they find homosexuality distasteful, and believe strongly that the right to have and defend -- even through legal discrimination against other citizens -- is what really needs protecting."
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,davidystephenson,3,Wed Jul 8 09:57:41 2015 UTC,"What follows is a wikipedia entry on his stance on this, as well as some of the history behind it. My personal opinion after reading what you said and thinking carefully about it is that the argument through which these are clearly prescribed by the constitution to go through the 9th & 10th amendments or through an article five process...is not a very convincing one to you. After having looked at a few of these past cases myself, he indeed uses the same legal reasoning in all of them, essentially that these things should be left to either the states or to the people themselves...or to a constitutional amendment process. In every one of these cases he is essentially assailing his colleagues on judicial activism (which may be a good thing in your mind, but others like myself and people like scalia disagree). It may come off as ""convenient"" that this would be the case, but it is a sound legal argument nevertheless, and an important one as well. I believe that an orginalist interpretation of the constitution isn't simply good for me, but for everyone in the country including our gay citizens. Regardless here is some of the history here:  Scalia has generally voted to strike down laws which make distinctions by race, gender, or sexual orientation. In 1989, he concurred with the Court's judgment in City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., in which the Court applied strict scrutiny to a city program requiring a certain percentage of contracts to go to minorities, and struck down the program. Scalia did not join the majority opinion, however. He disagreed with O'Connor's opinion, for the Court, that states and localities could institute race-based programs, if they identified past discrimination, and if the program was designed to remedy the past racism.[76] Five years later, in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña he concurred in the Court's judgment and in part with the opinion which extended strict scrutiny to federal programs. Scalia noted in that matter his view that government can never have a compelling interest in making up for past discrimination by racial preferences,  To pursue the concept of racial entitlement—even for the most admirable and benign of purposes—is to reinforce and preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that produced race slavery, race privilege and race hatred. In the eyes of government, we are just one race here. It is American.[77]  In the 2003 case of Grutter v. Bollinger, involving racial preferences in the University of Michigan's law school, Scalia mocked the Court majority's finding that the school was entitled to continue using race as a factor in admissions so as to promote diversity, and to increase ""cross-racial understanding"". Scalia noted,  This is not, of course, an ""educational benefit"" on which students will be graded on their Law School transcript (Works and Plays Well with Others: B+) or tested by the bar examiners (Q: Describe in 500 words or less your cross-racial understanding). For it is a lesson of life rather than law—essentially the same lesson taught to (or rather learned by, for it cannot be ""taught"" in the usual sense) people three feet shorter and twenty years younger than the full-grown adults at the University of Michigan Law School, in institutions ranging from Boy Scout troops to public-school kindergartens.[78]  Scalia has argued that laws that make distinctions between genders should be subjected to intermediate scrutiny, requiring that the gender classification be substantially related to important government objectives.[79] When, in 1996, the Court upheld a suit brought by a woman who wished to enter the Virginia Military Institute in the case of United States v. Virginia, Scalia filed a lone, lengthy dissent. Scalia felt that the Court, in requiring Virginia to show an ""extremely persuasive justification"" for the single-sex admissions policy, had redefined intermediate scrutiny in such a way ""that makes it indistinguishable from strict scrutiny"".[80]  In one of the final decisions of the Burger Court, the Court ruled in 1986 in Bowers v. Hardwick that homosexual sodomy was not protected by the right of privacy and could be criminally prosecuted by the states.[81] In 1995, however, that ruling was effectively gutted by Romer v. Evans, which struck down a Colorado state constitutional amendment, passed by popular vote, which forbade anti-discrimination laws being extended to sexual orientation.[82] Scalia dissented from the opinion by Justice Kennedy, believing that Bowers had protected the right of the states to pass such measures, and that the Colorado amendment was not discriminatory, but merely prevented homosexuals from gaining favored status under Colorado law.[83] Scalia later said of Romer, ""And the Supreme Court said, 'Yes, it is unconstitutional.' On the basis of—I don't know, the Sexual Preference Clause of the Bill of Rights, presumably. And the liberals loved it, and the conservatives gnashed their teeth.""[84]  In 2003, Bowers was formally reversed by Lawrence v. Texas, from which Scalia dissented. According to Mark V. Tushnet in his survey of the Rehnquist Court, during the oral argument in the case, Scalia seemed so intent on making the state's argument for it that the Chief Justice intervened: ""Maybe we should go through counsel.""[85] According to his biographer, Joan Biskupic, Scalia ""ridiculed"" the majority in his dissent for being so ready to cast aside Bowers when many of the same justices had refused to overturn Roe in Planned Parenthood v. Casey"
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,sylban,7,Wed Jul 8 10:12:36 2015 UTC,"More generally, Scalia is big on state's rights where gay issues are concerned, because he knows that states will take their sweet time coming around. He's probably still angry about Loving.  My point is that to the extent that the rationale in Loving is valid -- a presumption Scalia does not seem personally settled on -- then it equally applies here, for the same reasons. Marriage is a fundamental right, and the state infringement in both cases did not advance any public purpose other than animus, which could never be sufficient. As a result, to the extent that government makes available the instrument of marriage, it cannot deny it or refuse to recognise it on the basis of race or sexual orientation.  To categorically exclude one group easily and obviously falls under Equal Protection, and to deny access falls under Due Process. Both constitute infringement, and such infringement must meet a test of necessity. It failed that test, in 1967 and two weeks ago.  I know it would be very convenient for Scalia's purposes to argue otherwise, but I do not agree. And clearly neither did a majority of the high court, nor the vast majority of other federal justices who handled these cases over the last few years.  Let's just stop pussyfooting around here. Scalia does not like gay people. He finds them icky. Go and look up some of the things he's said about gays, homosexuality, and gay rights outside of court cases. He's got a deep personal issue about it. I wouldn't myself have suggested that he recuse himself from this case (nor would I for a moment suppose that he would), but if someone were to suggest that he should have, I would have at least studied their argument, since I believe the case could be made.  Scalia is a very intelligent man. He's also a bigot. And he's very, very good at massaging the law so that it always agrees with his own personal feelings.  He's advanced an argument that's not obviously fallacious. He's extremely good at that. But to do that, he has to deliberately reject the counterargument that would reach a conclusion different from the one he prefers. The vast majority of federal justices see it the majority's way, not his way. And though he's probably smarter than a lot of them, that's not why they see it differently.  Scalia's growing reliance on mockery, denigration, increasingly extreme digression, nonlegal language, clear intemperance, bizarre vocabulary, and sheer buffoonery should be a strong signal to any observers, legally savvy or not, that we are not hearing from a man who's willing to be a grown-up about issues he cares about personally. We're hearing the growing arrogance of a man who believes that he's right and anyone who disagrees with him is wrong, and who increasingly rejects the democratic and republican structures and principles that increasingly put him on the defensive as history passes him by and leaves him behind."
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,davidystephenson,2,Tue Jul 7 04:17:53 2015 UTC,You don't seem to be addressing Scalia's critique of the reasoning shared by Loving and Obergefell. Nowhere in his dissent does he claim to support Loving. How do you counter his argument that both rulings are unreasonable interpretations of the intent of the 14th amendment?
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,sylban,6,Tue Jul 7 09:12:59 2015 UTC,"And I'm not going to. It's a game of legal whack-a-mole, and he's a master of it. It's needless diversion. If it wasn't that, it would be some other diversion. His only purpose is trying to redirect argument down a path he believes achieves the result he finds suitable.  In Scalia's mind, it's just impossible that anything short of an explicit constitutional amendment affirming gay equality could ever result in what he's witnessed in recent years. He can't imagine how anything but sheer legal bumbling could produce these rulings favourable to the people he's absolutely sure that the majority of other citizens share his unkind views about. He could easily do this all day, and has powerful motive to do so. Indeed, he's been at it for many years.  But we don't need to follow him down his private legal rabbithole, tracing the secret paths that lead inevitably away from gay rights instead of towards them. One can if they want, and you are free to if you please. But I've been at this about as long as he has, from the other side, and I don't want to. And I don't have to.  There doesn't need to be any explicit provision within the constitution or federal law that marriage is a fundamental right. The dissent's own counterarguments provide sufficient basis for that. (Witness, for example, Roberts' asinine, self-serving, and factually untrue claims about this ancient human tradition. His facts are wrong -- and he has no excuse I can imagine to not know that -- but his broader thrust is clear, that marriage is as old as humanity. To reject the notion that marriage must therefore be fundamental would be irrational and indefensible.) So we don't need to find marriage -- of any kind -- in the constitution in order to constitutionally defend it.  After that, we need only look at what constitutional mechanisms defend fundamental rights, and Due Process and Equal Protection are right there. Scalia doesn't want to see it that way because it leads to a conclusion he finds personally unacceptable.  His own counterargument is no more than his attempt to find a different path, one that doesn't lead to that conclusion. We don't need to follow him down it, unless we already reject the majority's rationale here and in Loving. If you accept that, then there's no reason or need to explore Scalia's alternative path. If you don't accept it, then you don't agree, and I'm sorry about that."

You seem to be arguing that his legal claims can only be explained by bigotry. Ignoring the bluster, he seems to be arguing that the 14th amendment does not apply to marriage, which would counter both Loving and Obergefell.  Do you care to counter Scalia's legal argument? The individual you were responding to claimed to find Scalia's argument convincing on legal, not socio-moral grounds. It seems like your changing the subject from a discussion of the 14th amendment's meaning to how bigoted Scalia and Roberts are (a claim I personally agree with you on).  Why is Scalia's claim that ""We have no basis for striking down a practice that is not expressly prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment’s text, and that bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use dating back to the Amendment’s ratification,"" wrong?"
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,sylban,10,Tue Jul 7 12:48:06 2015 UTC,"Why is Scalia's claim that ""We have no basis for striking down a practice that is not expressly prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment’s text, and that bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use dating back to the Amendment’s ratification,"" wrong?   The Fourteenth Amendmest was about rebalancing the needs of society with the rights of individuals. It was drafted in context of a society that had learned the hardest way possible not to bind itself with its own laws, but to instead embrace open-ended liberty with an unknown and unknowable future in mind. It was not drafted to narrowly enshrine only those views and values held prevalent in the immediate postwar period. It was drafted to help stage the long, hard, painful road to healing and equality that could be the nation's only hope for a bright and prosperous future -- one far beyond the horizon of those who drafted it, as their own time was beyond the horizon of those who ratified the Constitution and Bill of Rights.  Pointing out that Reconstructionists would not have supported same-sex marriage is meaningless. It's like arguing that Lincoln would not have dropped an atomic bomb on Richmond. But to suggest that they would not have anticipated the changes of our time is to overlook the fact that we know they were aware of the same thing in their own time. No one at that time would have argued that the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to what was true and known then, and could never apply to knowns much later on.  The people of that time operated on laws which had been passed to them from nearly a century earlier, and fully understood how the application of law is contexualized by present history. Would the Second Amendment have been the same had the Maxim gun been around in the 1780s? We can't know. But we can reasonably speculate that laws of earlier generations apply not to them or their circumstances alone. Has anyone in living memory been in danger of having to quarter soldiers? What would the Founders have to say about the application of the Fourth Amendment to email? Would they smugly note that since email was not around, it clearly does not apply? Or would a rational person extend the law's clear intent to those newer manifestations of their original concepts?  Scalia wants us to accept first that marriage is not defended by the Constitution, and second that if it is, then only whatever kinds were around in the 1860s and 1870s are defended. That's deeply insulting to the people who drafted that Amendment, because it paints them as much more myopic and ignorant than they were. They understood all too well the impact of history, and the relationships between law and time. They had personally witnessed the worst possible collusion of those factors when laws are originally drafted without adequate deference to future unknowns.  Scalia wants the law to say only want he wants it to, and finds it very convenient that most of our laws predate our time, and their drafters didn't consciously anticipate specifics such as Justice Thomas's marriage. But the Reconstructionists had sufficient experience to understand how constitutional law is framed by changing circumstance, rather than being abandoned by it or inapplicable to it. The Amendments they put forward were to shape a future they knew they would not see. Had they intended differently, based on their experience, they would have included such restrictions as they felt appropriate.  Scalia wants us to ignore the clear intent of the Fourteenth Amendment in broad application towards personal liberty and equality, merely because it's effortless to point out that a healthy majority of that time would not have supported interracial or same-sex marriage.  But the majority does not even consider that perspective, nor do they need to. It is enough to acknowledge that marriage is an essential component of the most basic human dignity in our (or any) society, and that nothing so basic can be denied any citizen barring explicit denial in those same core legal documents. To whatever extent government provides marriage, it must do so equally for all citizens. And the Fourteenth Amendment is the instrument that advances basic equality and due process under our laws. To suggest that it does not defend a right to marriage is to suggest that no federal law does, or that federal law does not protect citizens at the state level, only at the federal level.  And Scalia might well agree with that, since he knows that the majority supports his marriage, so he's got nothing to worry about. As for Thomas, well, he might want to make sure he's living in the right state, I guess.  Beyond that, reciprocity seems clearly demanded, to the same extent, because it's simply irrational that it wouldn't be. Chaos is the inevitable result otherwise. Provisions such as Free Exercise were originally intended to ensure harmony among states with different established religions, and security for citizens passing through and between them. To whatever extent federal law defends marriage, it surely defends its reciprocity, elsewise how can married citizens function in our society? If you own property in one state and die in another, how can it fulfil the goals of the Founders and the certain intent of the Constitution they drew up to defend that second state's purported right to simply ignore your marriage rights under your own state?  I think it's very easy to put one's nose too close to the deep complexity of the law and find circles within circles, and strange paths leading to strange conclusions. But the very first lawyer I worked for taught me two maxims I have carried with me to this day: First, the law must do right by citizens. If it does not, then it is either misunderstood, misapplied, or simply wrong. If someone is suffering injustice, then something is wrong, and the law cannot defend that. Second, the vast bulk of law comes down to very common-sense human principles as old as our species -- things that almost everyone will readily agree on, the same things we all learn from our earliest days. Don't steal. Don't hurt people. Don't treat others badly just because they're different or you don't like what they say or think. Don't take more than your share. And more.  How could it ever be rational that our laws allow people to be treated differently for irrational reasons? Could it really be the overdue oversight that Scalia claims? Or does he just refuse to see it? Does he really maintain that we need a new law every time we get a little nicer towards each other, that fundamental freedoms like marriage have to be explicitly laid out, and categorically revised with every expansion of liberty? Would the founders he all but deifies really agree with that?"
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,dcman00000,4,Tue Jul 7 13:09:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great write-up which I think addresses the issue directly and clearly.   First, the law must do right by citizens. If it does not, then it is either misunderstood, misapplied, or simply wrong. If someone is suffering injustice, then something is wrong, and the law cannot defend that.   In my mind, this is the great legal controversy of the 20th century. Your sentiment reminds of the well-known Thurgood Marshall quote where he (somewhat facetiously) described his legal philosophy as ""[y]ou do what you think is right and let the law catch up."" The law must be just, and if it is not just, any mechanism that makes the law just is valid.  This is not the philosophy of Antonin Scalia, or, it would seem /u/dcman00000. They hold that the law exists, at least to some extent, separate from justice. A law may not be good, but that alone does not make it open to judicial change. They would claim, as would I believe a significant portion (though certainly not a massive majority) of the lay, intellectual, and legal populations, that a society under the rule of law does ""need a new law every time we get a little nicer towards each other,"" and that ""fundamental freedoms like marriage have to be explicitly laid out, and categorically revised with every expansion of liberty.""  This is, in fact, the core of Scalia's argument, that what is just should be determined by legislators and voters, not judges. In Scalia's mind, this turns judges from independent arbiters of a law's meaning into ""Rulers"" who can create rights and powers as they see fit, without restriction from voters.  I can understand both sides of this issue. I would probably consider myself very close to your side in your rejection of the power of traditional standards or presumed intent, but closer to /u/dcman00000 on role of the judiciary.  I think the lack of broad discussion on this question particularly, in favor of insults, side-steps, and deflections to particular issues, is unhealthy for our society. This question may be resolved, one way or another, in the next few decades. I think our society as a whole needs to determine what we want that answer to be.  I am nervous to give that much power to judges. For now, the judiciary and I are largely in agreement about what is just, with some notable exceptions, e.g., Citizen's United. But what will happen when the judiciary swings far away from what I think is just. What powers will I and other common people have to stop them?  Edit: Clarified some language."
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,dcman00000,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:51:08 2015 UTC,"This is very well put. I share Scalia's anxiety about judicial tyranny, I really do. A great deal of what he says in theory (for example, while giving interviews) resonates with me, and I imagine also with many others. But when I see him in action, I see a different man, one who seems to interpret those things he's said differently, and almost always in ways that just happen to harmonise with his apparent personal views. I find that difficult to respect.  As with many such things, I feel the truth falls somewhere in between. Take marriage reciprocity, for example. Even if it was not found in the constitution, lack of it could only result in chaos, confusion, and enormous injustice and unequal treatment of citizens (often randomly and unpredictable). Surely that cannot be a rational outcome, as it surely does not fulfil the vision of the Framers and all who've followed in that legacy.  Scalia might say, ""Gee, that's too bad. Get y'self an amendment, why doncha? Or just talk your state into doing the thing you want. Or, well, all the states, I guess. But still."" Marshall might have said, ""This must be the finding, even if it must be wrenched screaming from the nooks and crannies of the law, for this is what is right and just.""  I really do believe that both views are beyond the limits that the Framers envisioned and prescribed in Title III powers, and the most rational minds find themselves somewhere in between. If an initial review reaches an irrational or clearly harmful conclusion, then review it again. The Framers could not have desired irrational and harmful products of the law; that would be evil, or just plain nuts. Likewise, channelling A-Sca here a bit, the law does not say what it does not say, and any finding must at least have a plausible, rational, and defensible basis in what the law does say."
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,sylban,-1,Tue Jul 7 14:56:03 2015 UTC,"I like this comment a lot.  Especially this...   I am nervous to give that much power to judges. For now, the judiciary and I are largely in agreement about what is just, with some notable exceptions, e.g., Citizen's United. But what will happen when the judiciary swings far away from what I think is just. What powers will I and other common people have to stop them?   This is a huge problem with what they've done in my estimation. Since when did the Supreme court have the power to add or discover rights in the constitution? I understand that the court has done this many times, but in my mind it should not be so. And to make the point one more time, if you're worried about certain rights and freedoms being excluded in our society, there is a process in place already.   The constitution has specific enumerated powers delegated to the federal government, and then the 9th and 10th ammendments really (almost redundantly, as some founders argued) say the following:    The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,dcman00000,-3,Tue Jul 7 15:34:32 2015 UTC,"Marriage is a fundamental right, and the state infringement in both cases did not advance any public purpose other than animus, which could never be sufficient.   I agree. So where exactly is that right prescribed however? I contend that its through the 9th and 10th ammendments, as this part of the constitution (as well as the ammendment process) was intentionally designed to allow for unspecified rights. Marriage, as you may know, is not specifically prescribed in the constitution like for example the right to peaceably assemble or to a fair and speedy trial. THe majority opinion used the as their basis the 14th ammendment, which does have precedent in the loving case (precedent I LEGALLY disagree with), which I believe is legally erroneous as does scalia. Its...in our view... an improper use of the 14th that in effect ammends the constitution (through setting precedent) so that the 14th means something its authors never intended.   This is important because declaring this as a right takes the power away from the people and the states. This, in your view, may be a great thing. We may both agree that the fact that the first ammendment is not up for public debate is a great thing. You may extend this logic to a ""discovered"" right to gay marriage in the constitution. I however feel that this is an abuse of the document, and that through the intent of the founders and authors of the constitution and subsequent amendments the intent should be clear, that these issues were intentionally reserved to the states and the people.  After having read what you said again, and thinking about it carefully again, I believe that your primary angst with this line of thinking is that you do not trust the people or the states to make the right choice. I suppose that has merrit to an extent, but I also believe that given enough time the normal processes would have succeeded regardless. Take for example the huge change in public opinion on gay marriage in the last 10 or so years and i think my point stands. That change in opinion...btw... happened in both parties."
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,sylban,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:27:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry it took me so long to respond. Work, and then some stuff the computer needed and I'd put off too long.  The Ninth does not provide rights beyond those outlined elsewhere. It only says that those outlined are not the only ones protected. In effect, it obviated the need of the Framers to sit down and try to think of every possible thing that should be included, by allowing anything not included to be rationally derived from what is there. That's what allows the Court to 'find' things like privacy, a fundamental right to marriage, and more. If the finding is irrational, then the Court may overrule itself.  The Tenth is a redundancy. It's only there to assure states that the feds won't take away powers that they didn't delegate to Congress upon ratification. (And yes, there's more than a little debate about that in our time.)  A right to marriage does not need to be outlined, or even mentioned. It's rationally derived from the fact that it's ubiquitous and constant.  As evidence, consider those clerks and judges that have responded to same-sex marriage by refusing to issue any license. Now imagine what would happen if an entire state did that. If that's not political suicide, then what is/ I think you'll find that an overwhelming majority of Americans will readily put up with same-sex marriage if the other choice they're offered is no marriage at all.  If anthropologists or archaeologists have ever found or described any human society without some kind of marriage, I've yet to hear of it. That absolute ubiquity is all the evidence we need to recognise marriage as a universal human trait, and thereby fundamental as a liberty under our laws. If our constitution defends and protects universal human traits that are not injurious, then it must defend marriage for all citizens.  The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees Due Process and Equal Protection for ""all persons"" of the U.S. The Ninth allows for liberties not explicitly stated in the constitution, enabling the Fourteenth to defend marriage for all persons.  Obviously, reasonable limitations are justified by the need to advance legitimate public purposes. We don't allow minors to marry, for example. But no rational basis exists to deny marriage to gay persons. Scalia would have us believe that not liking gays -- if you really, really don't like them -- is reason enough. I'm sure many bigots agree with him. I'm also sure that many non-bigots do not, but the law generally does not side with bigots, as bigotry tends to conflict with liberty and equality. (And the liberty to discriminate against all gay equally doesn't count, despite what we've been hearing a lot lately.)  It's not about trust for me. It's about history. Time and again, The People have proven that can't be relied on to do what is clearly right and just. We give them a reasonable chance, and now and then they manage it on their own. But more often, it eventually becomes necessary for courts to step in and set things right. It shouldn't be that way, and I regret that it is, but that is the lesson history teaches us. It may be distasteful, but were it not for that, Justice Thomas and his 'wife' would most probably still not be able to enjoy their 'marriage' in Virginia, where they life. And Thomas would not have been able to have that wedding in his home state of Georgia, or anywhere close to it.  Title III powers exist to fix the problems that Title I powers either create or fail to fix, as required by the constitution. Or in this case, to do that which Congress hasn't the power to do on its own, for the same purpose. The People should not need this, but they clearly anticipated that need in the 1780s, which is why we have it."
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,dcman00000,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:42:46 2015 UTC,"I get the feeling you're either not reading what I'm typing, or don't understand it.  I'll try this as succinctly as possible...  I think gay marriage is just fine. I think the constitution has a way of allowing for that, and its through the 9th, 10th, and article 5 provisions.   So in other words, we agree that gay people should get married. I'm arguing that the supreme court usurped power that, if we take an originialist interpretation of the constitution, it never even had in the first place.   Now, about the 9th ammendment, this is literally what it says   The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.   So your assertion about the 9th is not true. I don't understand how you could come to that conclusion.   Now about the 10th   The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.   Yes, I agree that the tenth seemed a bit redundant, some of the framers said as much when this was proposed to be included. The purpose of it was to add an extra legal layer that restrained or limited the federal powers to just those enumerated.   I actually think we agree more than you beleive"
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,JimMarch,2,Tue Jul 7 14:13:03 2015 UTC,"The Tenth is superfluous. No less than the Supreme Court itself has said so, as well as some of the Framers. It served a political purpose of the time, not any unique legal purpose then or now.  We still pass needless laws like that today. Many of the same-sex marriage laws in the country include specific protections for clergy. Those protections are completely unnecessary, as they already exist in the First Amendment. But because the bulk of the populace does not understand that, it was necessary for political reasons to include those superflous provisions in many such bills, in states with a sufficiently high proportion of panicky citizens.  If the Tenth serves any purpose, it's to remind us today of the original intent and limitations of the federal constitution. But a reminder is all it is. It states nothing not already inherent in the language of the foregoing content, and adds nothing to it. In that respect, I would agree that it serves an important purpose. But I do not agree that constitutes any unique law in and of itself, or that the actual (even if not adequately realized) meaning and force of the rest of the Constitution is different or lesser without it.  I feel very differently about the Ninth, which I believe provides vital foundation for the constitutional constructionism that Scalia so deeply detests. And proves him wrong that the Constitution contains nothing not explicitly outlined therein. The Framers knew they couldn't possibly think of everything, and their papers show they couldn't even agree on what those things should be. The Ninth was the key they handed to future generations to shape the Constitution to their own will, so long as its central tenets and principles were preserved -- those that are laid out in it. (As well as the tools to revise that, if necessary. As it was even in their own time.)  I don't necessarily agree or disagree with any given statement or perspective. But this and similar threads have been filled with a lot of bold speculation and assertion, and I feel that the bulk of it has been misguided or an attempt to validate what people already believe, and I've found much of the argument and evidence unpersuasive.  Scalia has a clear motive in arguing for these earlier Amendments, and I maintain that that motive is the very reason for the existence of the Fourteenth and the need for its adoption. There were people in the 1860s who felt the Fourteenth was needless -- that whatever problems it was trying to solve were better solved through the political process -- and there are people today who still feel that way. Some of them have an irrational faith that given enough time, people will do the right thing; and sometimes they will, but the purpose and function of our Constitution and the Title III powers enforcing it is to ensure that The People needn't wait endlessly for right to be done that is already prescribed therein.  What would the nation be like today if we had to wait on every single CSA state to come around on all those things? Would Justice Thomas's 1987 wedding in Georgia have been lawful were it not for the high court's ruling twenty years prior affirming that it was? None of the remaining antimiscegenation states had repealed their laws in the prior two decades; is it reasonable to assume that the next two would have been different? Given that fact that as of this writing, a century and a half after the Civil War, the state that started still flies that battle flag, I think we can probably make an educated guess. We can't really know, of course; but as the daughter of an historian I believe I can make some pretty good guesses, and I believe most others could, too.  Constitutional law and its enforcement causes the most deeply held principles of our society to have effect within human timescales, rather than waiting for a simple majority to come around, which could take any arbitrary amount of time. Anyway, if we were going to just wait on that, what's the need for all these laws and courts? Surely, the People will just do the right thing, rather than needing to waste all this time and treasure on ensuring that the rules they already established are enforced properly in due time. People who accuse me of being cynical in that respect are correct for that reason. But I think history makes clear the need and purpose for rulings like Obergefell, and the good that our society gains from them.  It's rather surprising to me how often and how vigorously. Scalia seems to argue against the purpose and value of his own job. Perhaps you're right; perhaps I merely misunderstand. Yet I don't really believe that the vast majority of federal judges who disagree with him do so because he's objectively smarter than them and they're all just plain wrong."

Irrationally? Have you seen the change in popular opinion towards gay marriage? It was well on its way to legalization across the country, the change in opinion happened in BOTH parties btw.   Scalia has a clear motive in arguing for these earlier Amendments, and I maintain that that motive is the very reason for the existence of the Fourteenth and the need for its adoption.   I argue his motive is the integrity of the constitution. You may not beleive that, but I do. Regardless, its irrelevant because the legal arguments he makes are sound.

So you argue that it would have remained backwards thinking indefinitely? I think thats unreasonable. Furthermore, simply because its for a laudable goal does not necessarily mean its ok for the supreme court to do what its doing. I agree that things like anti-miscegnation laws a infuriatingly stupid, so are bans on gay marriage, or for that matter bans on polygamy. But a just cause does not mean that its ok to abuse the constitution. The integrity of which is important for a variety of issues that may not be so clear cut.    But I think history makes clear the need and purpose for rulings like Obergefell, and the good that our society gains from them.   That is...until the court rules against you. It is not democratic in principal, and does not live up to the spirit of our founding principals. Would you have been so comfortable with the courts decision had it not been on the side of a civil rights case like this? 9 unelected judges deciding for our entire republic what should and shouldn't be public policy? I seriously doubt that had the case not been on an issue of liberty and social justice like this you would think so. I beleive that in your mind, since legalizing gay marriage is a laudable goal, thats sufficient enough reason for the court to do what it did. I fundamentally disagree.    It's rather surprising to me how often and how vigorously. Scalia seems to argue against the purpose and value of his own job.    Why? He's an originalist judge, thats in part what they argue.    Yet I don't really believe that the vast majority of federal judges who disagree with him do so because he's objectively smarter than them and they're all just plain wrong.   Its not a ""vast majority"" first of all. Secondly its because they come from a different school of legal thinking on these matters.

NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,myakj,2,Wed Jul 8 07:16:18 2015 UTC,"The opinion in these cases is the furthest extension in fact— and the furthest extension one can even imagine—of the Court’s claimed power to create “liberties” that the Constitution and its Amendments neglect to mention.   He is so very, extremely wrong.  Sigh.  All the way back to when the whole idea of a Bill of Rights was being debated, the Anti-Federalists argued that there was a problem: future generations might assume that the only rights we have are what are found in the Constitution.  Everybody agreed at the time that wasn't the case.  ""Unenumerated rights"" have been mentioned repeatedly ever since.  For example, in the 1856 Dred Scott decision, the Supreme Court listed a whole bunch of civil rights (named as ""privileges or immunities"") while saying that blacks didn't have them.  The rights listed were mostly out of the Bill of Rights including the right to arms but also included this gem: a ""right to free travel without pass or passport"".  http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/60/393.html - do a CTRL-F text search on ""passport""  In 1870 the court in Ward v. Maryland found a right not to be discriminated against by a state you're visiting just because you're from another state.  There's also a right to engage in trade and contracts mentioned.  http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/79/418.html  Roe v. Wade famously found a right to privacy.  My point is this: unenumerated rights are not even remotely a new thing that Kennedy discovered for this decision.  Scalia had to know that."
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,dcman00000,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:22:37 2015 UTC,"He is so very, extremely wrong.   Look, thats not necessarily the case. I understand that this has been done many times throughout the history of the supreme court. The argument that originalists make is that it should not be doing that. So even though the supreme court has in fact ""discovered"" rights for a long time, people like me don't think thats the role of the supreme court.    All the way back to when the whole idea of a Bill of Rights was being debated, the Anti-Federalists argued that there was a problem: future generations might assume that the only rights we have are what are found in the Constitution. Everybody agreed at the time that wasn't the case.   Yeah, thats basically the entire purpose for the existence of the 9th and 10th amendments. Some people thought it was redundant to put them in when there were already enumerated power to the federal government and the first 8 of the bill of rights.    The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.   So this was supposed to be a clear way to reserve any rights not enumerated to either the states or the people.   This is the whole legal crux of the argument that orginalists make, and why we think ""discovery"" of rights through a liberal interpretation of the document is not only unnecessary, but takes the power away from the states and people and gives it to the supreme court.    My point is this: unenumerated rights are not even remotely a new thing that Kennedy discovered for this decision. Scalia had to know that.   Oh for certain. Nobody is necessarily arguing that. Its just that originalists think that everytime its been done has basically been an abuse of supreme court power, and should be left to what we think is the proper channels to do so...namely the 9th 10th and article 5 provisions."
NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,locallyunscene,2,Wed Jul 8 10:15:47 2015 UTC,"Justice Scalia, who IMHO has been unfairly branded in the media as some kind of reactionary involid   Read his Lawrence dissent.  He quite literally complains about the ""homosexual agenda"", sympathizes with people who don't want to work alongside gay people, attacks efforts by law schools to prevent discrimination against gay students, and accuses the entire legal profession of being ""anti-anti-homosexual"".  His bigotry could not be any more obvious.   So he officially is on the record as not having much of a problem with gay marriage in and of itself.   He is discussing his legal views, not his political views.  He is saying that, constitutionally, the government is entitled to recognize same-sex relationships if it wants to, not that he is personally OK with it.  I strongly suspect that he isn't personally OK with it, given how angry he is in this dissent.   So essentially this is an argument against a supreme court that ...in effect... took an issue out of the public discourse and the governing processes that govern it, and settled the matter. Nine unelected judges unaccountable to the people decided what should and shouldn't be law via this decision.   This is meaningless grandstanding.  He was quite happy for five unelected judges to take decisions about gun control out of the public's hands.   I think most would agree thats not exactly in the spirit of democracy   That's a very controversial claim that I'm not convinced most people would agree with.  There are lots of different models of democracy, a very popular one being liberal democracy, in which people have certain rights that are protected regardless of public opinion.   In these cases we look at the evidence of how the people who actually wrote the law interpreted it as a standard for what they meant.   Again, that's controversial, especially when you are trying to work out how an extremely broadly-worded (and intentionally so) 150-year-old constitutional amendment applies to a concept that its authors probably never thought about.   In other words, since the people who wrote the 14th amendment didn't interpret this to include issues relating to marriage, then there is no historical or legal basis for such an extension of the law. By this argument (which, in full disclosure, I find persuasive), then the LEGAL BASIS of both interracial marriage and gay marriage bans are not legitimate, and should not be based off of the 14th amendment.    I think you must have accidentally a few words somewhere in here.  If you are arguing that the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to restrictions on marriage, then I am confident that Scalia disagrees with you.   On top of that, it does so by expanding the ""legal"" authority of the government through a very shaky ""reinterpretation"" of the 14th amendment to discover a right that the authors clearly never intended.   This is far from the first case that recognized a 14th Amendment right to marriage, and far from the first case that recognized a 14th Amendment right not to be discriminated against by the government on the basis of your sexual orientation.  There's no big ""expansion"" of the 14th Amendment here - the outcome was an inevitable consequence of existing precedent."

His bigotry could not be any more obvious.   No, I completely disagree. It may be hard to fathom, but there are people like Scalia...and myself for that matter... who beleive that freedom of association between private parties is also a fundamental right and  at the same time not necessarily against gay marriage. Its not a great position to take on our part since it looks so admittedly shitty, however in a free country would we prosecute those who wish not to be around gay people? I understand that cases like this exist in regards to things like race, but is it the job of the government...or the supreme court for that matter... to force associations between private parties? I understand that its a far different story with public or government facilities, but don't I have a right to not associate if I wish. Under this logic I don't. I want to reiterate that I fully and wholeheartedly support gay marriage, and personally don't give a crap about being around gay people, but other people have genuine moral convictions or perhaps even simply have fear as reasons not to associate them, their businesses, or their families. I argue its a relatively minor part of the population that would take it that far, but the point is that in a free society shouldn't freedom of association be a part of that? Switch some roles here and think ....in good faith... how it would sound to force a black bakery owner to serve a KKK wedding, or perhaps a Jewish business is forced to subcontract with a neo nazi group. These aren't perfect analogies(I'm not calling gays nazis or anthything), but I think you understand the point.   Regardless, this is actually what he said in that case.   One of the most revealing statements in today's opinion is the Court's grim warning that the criminalization of homosexual conduct is ""an invitation to subject homosexual persons to discrimination both in the public and in the private spheres."" Ante, at 14. It is clear from this that the Court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed. Many Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children's schools, or as boarders in their home. They view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive. The Court views it as ""discrimination"" which it is the function of our judgments to deter. So imbued is the Court with the law profession's anti-anti-homosexual culture, that it is seemingly unaware that the attitudes of that  He is discussing his legal views, not his political views. He is saying that, constitutionally, the government is entitled to recognize same-sex relationships if it wants to, not that he is personally OK with it. I strongly suspect that he isn't personally OK with it, given how angry he is in this dissent.   I keep seeing this come up. I truly don't think that is the case, there is no good evidence for it in these opinions he writes. You can't just always assume the worst about your political opponents, thats the kind of thing that brings the conversation down. You're just assuming the only reason he could possibly be against it and angry is because hes, and everyone who agrees with him, is a closeted bigot. Thats not the case. Regardless, even if it was its besides the point since the legal arguments are sound. In truth what angers people like me about these supreme court decisions is the wanton disregard of the constitution and law in pursuit of whats is assumed (sometimes correctly) to be a laudable goal. The attitude is that if the law stands in the way of some kind of desirable goal, then to hell with the law...we'll use whatever clever interpretations of  the law we can to justify it. I understand the motivation completely, but then what happens to the integrity of the law and the constitution? If the law doesn't bind you, then eventually I may decide that the law doesn't bind me either depending on how cleverly I can interpet the law. And this is what upsets people like me so much about these decisions, the actualy issues involved like gay marriage are of little importance, in fact I supported it the entire time, but the venue through which it was accomplished harmed our constitution...which is bad for all including our gay citizens.

There are lots of different models of democracy, a very popular one being liberal democracy, in which people have certain rights that are protected regardless of public opinion.   I understand your point completely. So what exactly about 9 unelected judges unilaterally doing what basically amounts to amending the constitution fits into that spirit of democracy? I wish for gay people to get married, but with the way our constitution is set up there is several ways to accomplish this and its through the article 5 provision, the 9th and tenth amendments as well. ""discovering"" a right is an abuse of the document.    Again, that's controversial, especially when you are trying to work out how an extremely broadly-worded (and intentionally so) 150-year-old constitutional amendment applies to a concept that its authors probably never thought about.   Not if you take an originalist interpretation. Why would you extend this to mean something other than what the authors intended or considered? We can't just ""discover"" rights that don't expressly exist, or if vague weren't considered given the writings or interpretations by those who authored it.    I think you must have accidentally a few words somewhere in here. If you are arguing that the 14th Amendment doesn't apply to restrictions on marriage, then I am confident that   First of all he didn't write that opinion, and secondly I've argued the entire time that discovering rights in parts of the constitution where they literally don't expressly exist is a problem for this exact reason since it sets a precedent that continues into the future, in effect its tantamount to a constitutional amendment without the normal process.    This is far from the first case that recognized a 14th Amendment right to marriage, and far from the first case that recognized a 14th Amendment right not to be discriminated against by the government on the basis of your sexual orientation. There's no big ""expansion"" of the 14th Amendment here - the outcome was an inevitable consequence of existing precedent.   Oh I agree, my point is that the expansion of it in the first place is the problem. These ""discovery"" of rights and setting precedent set problems like this into the future, which is exactly why people like me get so angry about this kind of abuse of the law."

Virginia, a question comes to mind of a more human note as opposed to legal.  How are people like me who are personally affected by decisions made in either Loving v. Virginia or Obergefell v. Hodges supposed to remain neutral on topics like this? Reading the opinions of those who feel that SCOTUS erred in their reasoning with both cases and that these things should have been left to either a constitutional amendment or resolution by vote within the States just makes me furious and sad. I'm not a States' Rights guy when it comes to discrimination. I have a fairly strong distaste for religion on top of that.

NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,Retsejme,5,Wed Jul 8 23:09:01 2015 UTC,"There are several reasons.  SDP and EPC jurisprudence changed a whole lot between 1967 and today.  Washington v. Glucksberg, decided in 1997 changed the way the court evaluates fundamental rights.  The court in Glucksberg held that there was no constitutional right to physician assisted suicide because the right was not ""deeply rooted in our nation's history.""  Further, Glucksberg used to stand for the principle that if you were going to look to history to establish a fundamental right, you must narrowly tailor that right.  Kennedy addressed the ""narrowly tailored right"" bit in his opinion:   Objecting that this does not reflect an appropriate framing of the issue, the respondents refer to Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997), which called for a “‘careful description’” of fundamental rights. They assert the petitioners do not seek to exercise the right to marry but rather a new and nonexistent “right to same-sex marriage.” Brief for Respondent in No. 14–556, p. 8. Glucksberg did insist that liberty under the Due Process Clause must be defined in a most circumscribed manner, with central reference to specific historical practices. Yet while that approach may have been appropriate for the asserted right there involved (physician-assisted suicide), it is inconsistent with the approach this Court has used in discussing other fundamental rights, including marriage and intimacy. Loving did not ask about a “right to interracial marriage”; Turner did not ask about a “right of inmates to marry”; and Zablocki did not ask about a “right of fathers with unpaid child support duties to marry.”  Rather, each case inquired about the right to marry in its comprehensive sense, asking if there was a sufficient justification for excluding the relevant class from the right.    Kennedy makes a good point, but he is nonetheless turning his back on an 18 year old precedent, conservative justices don't like that.  While Kennedy's opinion is lyrical and poetic, and I personally agree with the outcome, it does not follow or adhere to any kind of judicial discipline.  Now this is a whole can of worms, but I'll summarize the best I can.  The typical test for EPC and SDP cases is to determine if there is either a suspect class involved (e.g. race or gender) or if there is a fundamental right that is being deprived.  If there is, the court usually subjects the law to strict scrutiny, which means the law will likely fail, and if there isn't the court will subject the law to a ""rational basis"" test.  This traditional analysis was not followed in Kennedy's opinion.  He starts talking about fundamental rights and SDP, but then turns to equal protection.  From a conservative standpoint, that kind of judicial trail blazing is not welcome.  (This was Scalia's whole fortune cookie nonsense.)    There is also just the general ebb and flow of differences in Constitutional interpretation.  The conservatives of the court are not big on reading non-textual rights out of the Constitution and are not fans of the ""living Constitution.""  To them the Constitution is a dead document, and it should be interpreted with care.  (This was Roberts' ""the constitution has nothing to do with this"" thing).   Hope this helps!"

NeutralPolitics,3cbj8d,druglawyer,4,Tue Jul 7 00:12:55 2015 UTC,"Political historians of the future may have a clearer perspective on this than the myopia of our contemporary and cultural proximity allow, but we can at least speculate.  My own sense is that it comes down to the fact that race is pretty much objective --  self-evident, that is, obvious from the simplest, even most uneducated observation -- while sexual orientation is, for outside observers, mainly subjective. It's indisputable that people are born whatever race the care, and can't change it. But our society does not yet universally accept the same sense about sexual orientation.  As recently as only two months ago, a Pew Research poll found that Americans are about evenly divided right now on the question of whether being gay is innate (and immutable) or a choice. And those are only the ones who had an opinion on it: 17% weren't even willing to offer a view one way or the other.  The question of whether gay people choose to be gay becomes magnified when it gets into politically and emotionally charged areas such as the Supreme Court's recent decision of whether or not this particular human characteristic merits protection under the constitution (the technical legal terminology is whether it meets the appropriate level of scrutiny), and whether the public's contrary interest (public purpose) is sufficient to justify such infringement. (A number of different public purposes were purported through the many cases leading up to the final ruling, but most federal courts quickly dismantled the more fallacious claims, most of them arriving at the rather obvious conclusion that general dislike was the only real motive.)  If you believe that gays are 'born that way,' then it's pretty much inevitable that you have to find in their favour in a question like this. But if you don't, then it's harder to agree that they deserve legal protection for what you believe is a choice they make -- meaning, they could also choose not to make it, or to make a different one.  I won't go into the merits of that long-running debate (which is likely to continue for many years, and maybe forever), but the relevance to your question is that that that important factor was never a part of any dispute about race. That is, while people did and still do debate over what races exist and who belongs to which, and to what degrees, there's never been any notion (well, until very recently) that race is a choice people make.  In 1967, the only question on the table was whether race merits protection under the law, and the firm and unanimous answer was yes. In this latest ruling, five Justices felt as strongly about same-sex couples, for the same reasons, but four others disagreed about the nature and place of same-sex attraction in American society and law. Though it was not made central to any of the five different opinions presented, whether being gay is a choice or not was almost certainly central to all of them."

But they have the power to rule on the constitutional effects of those definitions, and that's what all these cases were about. That states arbitrarily chose to treat same-sex couples differently was found to 1) violate Due Process and Equal Protection, and 2) advance no public purpose that would justify such infringement.  'Marriage' has many different meanings in common speech, but it has only one meaning in law, and that meaning is not defined in law by who has access to it or why, but rather what rights and responsibilities attach to the instrument once sealed.  Far too often, people confuse the legal term with its popular but misleading synonymous use for matrimony, the wholly non-legal joining which may be recognised outside the law.  As both marriage and matrimony are attributes of the same shared society, it's no coincidence that they're usually defined in very similar terms by the same people. But they are not the same thing. Churches may solemnise any kind of matrimony they please -- or not -- entirely beyond the reach of the law, as firmly guaranteed under the separation clauses of the First Amendment. Likewise, the state may have any marriage laws it finds suitable, as determined by The People, and no church may say otherwise, under the exact same constitutional provisions of separation."
NeutralPolitics,3cd8sm,KibblesNKirbs,15,Tue Jul 7 00:27:52 2015 UTC,"This is a complicated issue and there are many perspectives.  In short, Tsipiras believes default is preferable to a continuation of the austerity policies insisted upon by Greece's creditors, because those policies seem to be shrinking Greek GDP faster than they're raising net revenue, meaning Greece will only get deeper in the hole if it continues on that path. From the debtors' creditors' side, they believe the only way Greece will  be able to sustain itself is by continuing to implement the suggested reforms.  But the citizens are feeling the effect. Greece has been in deep recession for seven years now and the people are fed up, which is why they voted overwhelmingly 'no.' The troika seems blind to the fact that they themselves have spawned the shift in Greek politics they're now having to wrestle with.  If Greece defaults, which I agree, seems inevitable, it will be a de facto exit from the euro, because the government won't have any money to pay its workers. It will have to either start printing its own currency or issue IOUs, which will probably thereby become a default currency.  Then what? They'll devalue the currency. Greek olive oil, cheese, wool and vacations will become very cheap for Europeans, who will start spending their euros to buy them. Greece will slowly recover and they'll manage their new currency just like all nations do, devaluing it as necessary to spurn exports.  This devaluation is a key tool for central banks, especially in countries with small, dynamic economies. In my opinion, Greece should have left the Eurozone years ago in order to take advantage of it, but the terms of the currency union do not provide a mechanism for exit. I've been arguing for years that they should have moved to a dual-currency system and saved themselves some of this headache.  As far as the eurozone as a whole, it doesn't bode well for them. A number of other eurozone economies are in situations similar to Greece, and they're watching carefully to see what happens. Early in the crisis, Iceland (not a eurozone country, but with significant foreign debt and deposits) defaulted and they've managed to stage a relatively rapid recovery. If Greece can weather the initial storm and start to turn things around after a default, the eurozone countries may have to reexamine their treaty."

NeutralPolitics,3cd8sm,nosecohn,6,Tue Jul 7 20:12:54 2015 UTC,"First off, this article gives a pretty good background on the issue. You had asked for that in your post.   Do you have a source (or can you elaborate) on the austerities being worse in the long run than bankrupting and leaving the EU?   Sure.  It's common for investors to look at a country's debt-to-GDP ratio, because GDP roughly correlates to a country's ability to repay the debt (not in all cases, but for the sake of this argument, it applies). The problem with austerity programs is that, although they may reduce government spending, they also reduce GDP, because all those people who work for, or in conjunction with, the government, end up unemployed, less employed or underpaid. They, in turn, stop spending money, so the whole economy suffers, which in turn leads to a drop in GDP (and tax revenue).  So, even if austerity programs allow a country to pay down its debt in the short term, if GDP falls, the ratio of debt-to-GDP goes up, meaning ability to repay future debt is diminished. The conclusion is that improving the overall health of the economy (GDP growth) has a much greater effect on a country's ability to repay its sovereign debt than any reasonable changes in government spending priorities, and in many cases, cutting spending to pay down debt only makes matters worse.  Paul Krugman gets some flak for his political positions, but he is a Nobel-winning economist who uses some fairly basic calculations to conclude:"" Austerity for a country in Greece’s position appears to be an unworkable solution even if debt is all you care about.""   Aren't drastic spending cuts/tax raises necessary to salvage their economy and stay in the EU?   In the EU, or in the Eurozone? The former is the political union, and there's no talk of them leaving that. The latter is the currency union, where all members supplant the euro for their local currency. That's what's the Greeks are likely to leave, bringing back their own currency. There are already EU members who are not in the Eurozone.  The austerity vs. stimulus argument has been ongoing, but if you look at the recoveries of Europe vs. the US since the Great Recession, it's pretty clear which tactic works better. Through watching it all unfold, I have been converted to what I would call a reluctant Keynesian. The US recession was deeper and more sudden, but the country took on debt to stimulate the economy and recovered much more quickly than Europe, which largely followed an austerity approach. I still think Keynes' policy recommendations are often misapplied, especially in good economic times, but the worldwide reactions of various policy-makers to the 2008 recession provided the kind of data economists only dream about. From my position as a layperson, it's clear that if a country has stimulus is an option, it's a much more effective way to get out of a recession, and the US probably should have done more of it.  Granted, there are plenty of people, economists included, who would disagree with my analysis and conclusions, but I don't think the evidence supports that ""spending cuts/tax raises"" are the only way out for Greece. You increase revenue by growing the economy, not shrinking it, and so far, the Greek reforms have shrunk the economy. I suspect Iceland will provide a roadmap for the Greeks moving forward."

NeutralPolitics,3cd8sm,nosecohn,2,Wed Jul 8 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks for contributing your perspective.   But all that would have happened with or without european assistance.   Not necessarily. Don't forget where and how a lot of this debt originated. A large portion of Greek debt (by some accounts, the majority) was held by hedge funds and private investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs, who used the same CDS mechanism that brought down the US mortgage market to mask the severity of Greek government deficits, thereby allowing them to rate Greek debt much higher than it should have been and sell more of it. The banks themselves (and their investment clients) should have taken the hit for that, but the ECB preferred to buy the Greek debt from the banks rather than let a eurozone country default:   This debt was initially owed to private-investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs. But the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB) made the suicidal decision to let those private banks transfer that debt to EU institutions and the IMF to ""rescue"" Greece.   Greece should have defaulted on or restructured its private debt back in 2010 and let the banks take the haircut. They're investment banks. Risk is their game. They have no political obligation to ""rescue"" anyone. But now that the European sovereigns hold some of that debt, European taxpayers are on the hook for it, which sows dissent within the EU.  Of the remaining debt, a significant amount is still held by private European banks, who are also being bailed out by European taxpayers instead of taking it on the chin like they should. And in the process, the troika is setting European nations against each other over what is really a small amount of money by comparison to the whole European debt market.  Greece overleveraged itself through the same delusional investment market mechanisms as other countries and market sectors in the early 2000s. Had the troika not stepped in, Greece would have defaulted on that debt five years ago and gotten a head start on a process that was foreseeable and inevitable. Instead, it is now just beginning. Yes, they would have had to implement capital controls, cut some benefits, crack down on tax avoidance, and come up with a new (heavily devalued, at first) currency, but somebody would have eventually loaned them money. Iceland's situation, though not exactly equivalent, provides a roadmap for the way out.   The elected greek government has done little to nothing to help the country, other, it seems, than to insulate the upper class the best they can.   I haven't read anything about the new government insulating the upper class. Can you point me to a source for that?   I don't see how refusing the bailouts is going to help their banks at all.   Oh, it won't help their banks. Their banks will be in trouble initially, and there's much restructuring to be done. The point is to help the Greeks themselves, not their banks.   The public isn't feeling the effects of the bailouts so much as they are feeling the effects of their economy having burst, and their government, the old one or the new one, having done little to nothing about it.   Greece has implemented substantial reforms on its own and as conditions of the previous bailouts. By some measures (admittedly, their own), they were running a budget surplus at the beginning of this year. In the latest round of talks, they agreed to even more reforms (probably more than their people would have supported), but then the talks broke down.    The troika seems desperate to be trying to fighting greek politicians to bail out greece.   I don't see it that way. The troika is acting as the foreign banks' (and now the taxpayers') debt collector, trying to recoup money from Greece that should never have been loaned in the first place. Default is inevitable. The longer it gets delayed, the more discord and nationalism it will sow across Europe. The Greeks need to get out of the eurozone. If you love someone, set them free.   Greece wants to increase government spending.   Well, if you mean stimulus, yes. That's how you get out of recession. If there's anything we've learned since 2008, it's that.   Voting against the bailouts is only going to mean bigger payments at higher interest.   Correct, but if GDP recovers, so will their ability to pay. Greek GDP has only been declining under the austerity programs. Even the IMF admits the present path is unsustainable.   The alternative is to print their own money, which will lead to hyperinflation.   Yes, precisely. It will be very difficult for a while, but it's been quite difficult for the Greeks for a long time already. When what you're doing now isn't working, it's time to try something else.   If there is a grexit, is there any hope that the greek banking system won't crash?   No. It will have to crash and be reborn.   As for your, ""they'll just lower export prices and everything will be sunshine and moonbeams""   OK, I didn't write that, and I certainly didn't mean to imply anything that rosy (or made of straw). Default and Grexit will be very difficult for the Greeks. There will be capital controls, severe inflation, high unemployment and a widespread inability to buy foreign goods. But the slow decline they've been living through is no better, and there was no end in sight. If handled properly, in three to five years, the Greeks will be much better off.   Well they just fucked themselves out of everything they were protesting FOR as far as I can tell.   They're protesting to control their own destiny. They may fail spectacularly, but they'll do it on their own terms, and it won't be because they want government services without paying for them.  This stereotype that the Greeks are all lazy tax avoiders is European propaganda designed to boost support for the troika's extortive measures to support their benefactors. It has been roundly disproven, but the European media harps on this characterization because it serves their interests.  It's ironic that all the organizations and treaties at the foundation of this crisis were designed to create unity, yet we've gotten to the point where average European citizens, who are merely pawns in the middle of what should be a minor debt negotiation, are set against each other by nationality, using old stereotypes as their weapons. It's a sad and short-sighted path the troika has led the people down."
NeutralPolitics,3cd8sm,cp5184,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:27:12 2015 UTC,"Couldn't the troika be trying to preserve greece's bond rating by taking greek debt?  It's in everybody's interest for greece to be in a good position to borrow money from the private sector.   I haven't read anything about the new government insulating the upper class. Can you point me to a source for that?   So greece has cracked down on property tax evasion?  They've raised taxes on the upper class more than lower classes?  Apparently greece has tripled the taxes on the lower classes, squeezing water out of a rock, has greece tripled it's taxes on the upper class and actually enforced it?  Aren't the greeks outraged about account withdrawl restrictions?  Do you think people outraged that they're limited to 30 euro per day withdrawls want to lose all their savings?  They're running a surplus but they can't make a $1.6 billion payment on their quarter trillion debt?  Haven't the terms of the bailout loans to greece been pretty favorable?   OK, I didn't write that, and I certainly didn't mean to imply anything that rosy (or made of straw). Default and Grexit will be very difficult for the Greeks.   Where did you say that it will be catastrophic to the greek people, that there's a good chance 11 million people will lose any savings they have in banks, that their financial system will collapse, that there will be incredible strain on their business sector, with thousands of companies unable to make payroll, and it will also have a catastrophic effect on government benefits, government services, and pensions.  They want to be able to default on their loans, right after they borrowed a quarter trillion from the EU, at horrific cost to both the EU and themselves.  I'm sure greeks working fulltime jobs are the salt of the earth.  That doesn't mean that there isn't rampant tax evasion, and that doesn't mean that the government isn't rife with corruption, excess, and poor management.  Yes.  Isn't it terrible how the greeks are scapegoating the germans, using german stereotypes, bringing back nazi references."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,Enigmaticly,16,Mon Jul 6 19:06:43 2015 UTC,"So this gets a little controversial, but there is a fairly good case to be made that the trust fund is an accounting fiction and that it ""running out"" is not really meaningful.  This column gives a pretty good overview and comes down on the ""not meaningfully real"" side of things.  As such, the running out, or not, of the trust fund is not a real constraint on future payment of Social Security benefits.  The benefits always have and will continue to be paid entirely by current tax revenues + borrowing from the public.  The question of whether future payments will be made is fundamentally only if the future payments will overwhelm tax revenue + borrowing.  All that is to say, letting people opt out would be much more expensive than you might.  This piece talks about the issue, but essentially, the current beneficiaries will still all want their checks, but with less FICA tax revenue coming in, you'd need to either raise other taxes or borrow a lot more money from the public.  The government is using present-year revenue to pay present-year beneficiaries, and even if future obligations are reduced, there would be an explosion of the present deficit."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,huadpe,9,Mon Jul 6 22:27:23 2015 UTC,"Given the future insolvency of the Social Security Program...   I don't actually think that's a given.  If you look through some of the history of Social Security, you'll see that dire warnings were made about near-term solvency in 1977. A legislative fix was enacted. By 1982, predictions were that the SS Trust Fund would run out of money the following year. Instead, the act was amended. In 1993, there was a similar concern. A change was made to make more benefits taxable.  This pattern of ""sky is falling"" warnings followed by patches has been constantly repeating since that time, and there's no reason to think it will stop. Here's a 1994 article on how to ""fix"" Social Security. It's one of many on the topic. In fact, the search term ""fix social security"" yields almost as many results as ""myths about social security."" The Motley Fool ranks forthcoming bankruptcy as the No. 1 Myth."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,nosecohn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:07:29 2015 UTC,"There is something unique about this insolvency that was not a factor in 1977, 1982, or 1993. That is the baby boomers retiring. You have a generation of 80 million people retiring over the next 20 years and all drawing SS with a longer life expectancy. That is unprecedented."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,mrhymer,2,Tue Jul 7 16:35:46 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, that's likely to lead to a reduced benefit (about 25%), higher tax on those working at that time, or a bit of both. None of those is great options, but insolvency is not the likely outcome."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,nosecohn,0,Tue Jul 7 18:29:14 2015 UTC,You are correct. More than half what the middle class earns going to federal taxes is the outcome if spending is not cut somewhere.
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,mrhymer,2,Tue Jul 7 23:46:01 2015 UTC,"Can you point me to numbers that indicate avoiding a 25% reduction in benefits would equate to more than half of middle class earnings going to federal taxes? That seems like a lot.  I'm looking at the table on page 16 of the report (PDF) from CBO on the Distribution of Income and Household taxes. If we remove the highest and lowest quintiles to focus on the 60% of earners we would presumably call the ""middle class,"" we see the average rate of total Federal taxes (not just income) they currently pay is about 12 percent:  Second Quintile: 8.0 Middle Quintile: 12.3 Fourth Quintile: 16.4   Is it your contention that in order to avoid a 25% reduction in Social Security benefits, the Federal taxes paid by those people would more than quadruple on average?  Page 37 of the SSA's Fast Facts & Figures About Social Security, 2013 (PDF) summarizes ""The Long-Run Financial Outlook"" this way:   Social Security is not sustainable over the long term at current benefit and tax rates. In 2010, the program paid more in benefits and expenses than it collected in taxes and other noninterest income, and the 2013 Trustees Report projects this pattern to continue for the next 75 years. The Trustees estimate that the trust fund reserves will be exhausted by 2033. At that point, payroll taxes and other income will flow into the fund but will be sufficient to pay only about 75% of program costs. As reported in the 2013 Trustees Report, the projected shortfall over the next 75 years is 2.72% of taxable payroll.   That last part seems to indicate that at 2.72% rise in payroll taxes alone, without touching income tax or other sources of revenue, would completely eliminate the need to reduce benefits down the line. I may not be understanding the issue or your contention completely, so if I've missed something, please correct me, but that number does not seem to jibe with a quadrupling of Federal taxes paid by the middle class."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,nosecohn,2,Wed Jul 8 00:55:27 2015 UTC,My contention is not that this one entitlement is going to be the source of the tax increase. The totality of all federal entitlement spending. There will likely be a boomer public sector union crisis that will be bailed out. Welfare has quietly repealed its limit to benefits. Who knows what else in the next 20 years that voters will grant themselves. It is a vicious cycle of spending that has not been successfully reduced in a hundred years.

NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,nosecohn,2,Wed Jul 8 14:38:22 2015 UTC,"No. First of, all the real numbers say the program is funded by itself through about 2065. Secondly - letting people opt out would steal from those that already funded."

Other sources have told me the ""Social Security Is Bankrupt"" meme is one of those echo chamber ""Big Lie"" things that run on their own inertia.  I hear a lot about it from one side (being broke) the other side (solvency) just says ""not broke""."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,Jewbilant,-2,Thu Jul 16 01:14:58 2015 UTC,"Well, it would be pretty disastrous for the solvency of the program. Social Security is a pretty big redistribution scheme, from rich people to poorer people. If you earned at the maximum taxable amount for each of the last 35 years, then your monthly benefit is going to be $2,686. If you earned at half the maximum, your monthly benefit is going to be $1,930. If you earned at 1/4 of the maximum, your monthly benefit is going to be $1,204. So as you can see, while taxes are proportional to income, benefits are not. The rich subsidize the poor.  The natural consequence of allowing an opt out provision is that the rich would opt out while the poor will remain in. Such a system would not be sustainable without drastically cutting the benefits for poor people."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,IpeeInclosets,2,Tue Jul 7 00:51:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry, complete bullshit...rich subsidize the poor...the tax caps out around 110k of income.  You are well into the middle class.  It's upper middle subsidizing lower and lower middle class, maybe.  The 'rich' contribute relatively little to SS."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,Jewbilant,-1,Tue Jul 7 12:10:47 2015 UTC,"The rich contribute a relatively small percentage of their income, but it's the same amount of money as the upper middle class you speak of (who are around the 95th percentile, depending on a few factors). So the top 5% or 10% subsidize poorer peoples."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,IpeeInclosets,3,Tue Jul 7 13:40:40 2015 UTC,"Alright, challenge me with your numbers.  My back of napkin calculation is saying the max contribution possible per person is 110k * .062 = 6820  Assume 1 in 10 people make this contribution.  Now, your assumption is that the contributions of the rest is below this threshold, so that means 6820 / 10 = 682 as the average contribution per person.  682 / .062 = 11k...huh look at that.  There is no fucking way the lower 90th  percentile make an average of 11k.  Try your percentile again...my assertion is that it is the middle class that subsidizes the middle and lower class.  This doesn't even take into account minimum contributions...but I'll call it a wash because disability skews it a little as well.  The rich do subsidize the federal government, but not ss."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,Jewbilant,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:58:16 2015 UTC,"Your mistake here is your assumption that in order to subsidize the social security system, the top 10% of earners must pay a majority of the SS taxes. That isn't a necessary condition for my statement to be true. All that my statement means is that the highest earners pay more in SS taxes than they receive in benefits, which is plainly true based on how benefits are calculated.   If the highest earners are paying 30% of the taxes but only receiving 15% of the benefits, then they're subsidizing the system. If they were to stop paying SS taxes and stop receiving benefits, the solvency of SS would be diminished."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,IpeeInclosets,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:28:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure on benefit calculation,  but I do know the more you pay in the more you get out.   The opportunity or roi is certainly subsidized by the middle class.  By your logic,  anyone who gets less out than they pay in is subsidizing.   Which actually applies to poor, middle and rich, who die before hitting the roi break even point.   Would be extremely curious how that factor plays...I'd assume lower income, harder labor correlates to earlier death, but dunno the numbers on it."
NeutralPolitics,3cc10y,Jewbilant,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:11:27 2015 UTC,"Individuals who pay more in do get more out, but it isn't a 1:1 proportion. Individuals who pay twice as much don't get twice as much of the benefits. Simply put, your monthly benefits are calculated based on the average of your adjusted monthly income in your 35 highest earning years. From there, you get 90% of the first $826, 32% of the next $4,154, and 15% of all income up to the maximum taxable amount. The taxes are flat, the benefits are skewed toward the lowest earners.   As for your second point, I'm not sure about the details, but I'd agree that any class that on average, pays more in than they get out, is subsidizing the system. Also, I'd note that hard labor jobs are often fairly high paying. The lowest paying jobs are mostly service jobs that earn a fraction of most ""hard labor"" jobs earn. Wealthy people do indeed live longer, but it probably has more to do with cultural factors & healthcare services than it does with physically strenuous jobs."

Let's say you organize a private event so that specific people can get informed on an issue. Let's just say it's ""Violence in America."" You and your team choose the participants and set it up according to your own vision.  But then it becomes popular enough outside of your group that everyone else wants to get in. You've got plenty of people who don't share the vision of you or your audience claiming they should be allowed to participate, not because they have a right to, but simply because the event has become widely regarded as a good source of information.  Should you be compelled to let them on your panel of experts? Does the fact that your private event has become a widely-cited source of information mean you should be forced to make it a public event or open it up to non-invited participants? Would you apply that standard to all private events?  The issue here is that people believe the CPD is an official, government-run organization. The CPD itself puts forth that image and the media is complicit in furthering that impression. The electorate is being deceived about what these debates really are.
