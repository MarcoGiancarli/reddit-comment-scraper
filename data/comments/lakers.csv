lakers,3drn34,ShaneMichaelOfficial,28,Sat Jul 18 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"Through most of summer league, he didn't show great end-to-end effort. He is coming off from an 8 month injury and played poorly in the first 2 games too. I get that he wants as many minutes as possible, but there are other guys on the team who want to showcase what they can do too.  20 minutes per game isn't even that bad.. that's half of a game. I would expect him to get around 25 minutes next year."
lakers,3drn34,misterrunon,2,Sat Jul 18 20:45:31 2015 UTC,"Minutes limitation really only about injury precaution as he gets back into the swing of things. Which is why this is more clickbait than anything. Dude just wants to get back to playing.  That being said, he does need to work harder on defense and rebounding, but part of that should come with better conditioning."

lakers,3drn34,owningypsie,11,Sun Jul 19 02:36:59 2015 UTC,He sounds reeeally demoralized
lakers,3drn34,Frangell,0,Sat Jul 18 20:10:40 2015 UTC,He doesn't like the feels the questions are bringing up. I think he handled it well considering how hard he seems to have taken the losses
lakers,3drn34,TimeisIllmatic95,12,Sun Jul 19 02:36:05 2015 UTC,I love his attitude. No settling for mediocrity.
lakers,3drn34,CaptainRatTrap,3,Sat Jul 18 22:15:50 2015 UTC,He just needs to be patient and continue to work especially on the mid-range jumper to keep defenders honest.
lakers,3drn34,PaperDesk,3,Sun Jul 19 01:19:42 2015 UTC,The lakers were protecting Randle. Randle doesn't have anything to prove in summer league. The FO was more interested in their other players because the roster still has open spots. The FO did the right thing in protecting his minutes because the guy just came off a devastating injury and already had the foot problem to begin with. The summer league mind is different if the lakers were really trying to win games Dlo would not have sat out the last few minutes of these games
lakers,3drn34,k4f123,0,Sun Jul 19 02:06:33 2015 UTC,"Well if they don't start him I'll be pretty upset. Limiting his minutes and not giving him a starting role is pretty ridiculous when he clearly wants more time to prove himself. If they are already convinced then that's good, but if not I'm disappointed."
lakers,3drn34,PaperDesk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:30:53 2015 UTC,Bass will start. There is no way a rookie should start over a guy like Bass.
lakers,3drn34,kemar7856,3,Sun Jul 19 18:16:34 2015 UTC,Well considering Bass didn't even start for the Celtics last year. It's not as big of a lock as you think.

lakers,3drn34,myLeftTesticleofFury,2,Mon Jul 20 04:49:08 2015 UTC,I like the attitude in a way. He wants as many minutes as possible to show how good he can be. But he needs to hit the brakes a bit.  He needs to work on his D. A lot. He kept getting burned and although we have Hibbert we cant have anyone be a liability on defense on the floor. He needs to keep working and get better everyday and he will slowly see his minutes improve.  Give it time big fella.
lakers,3drn34,Donkeykongalan,0,Sun Jul 19 01:23:39 2015 UTC,"It's summer league.  His status is secure, so he's gotta be a team playa.  He's frustrated?  I'm disappointed."

lakers,3dp0wz,khighyle,3,Sat Jul 18 02:31:11 2015 UTC,"I love his passing game, and his shot has gotten better every single game, but I am a bit worried about how little explosiveness he has. He just never seems to beat anyone off the dribble without a screen.  That said, its fucking summer league, I'll reserve actual judgement till probably mid season when hes adjusted to the speed of the NBA and is for sure in NBA shape."
lakers,3dp0wz,Notalent13,8,Sat Jul 18 08:12:59 2015 UTC,Does he really need to beat anyone off the dribble one on one? He's a pure pg that sets his teammates up.  A screen would allow him to create mismatches opening up opportunities.
lakers,3dp0wz,kingtarzan,5,Sat Jul 18 09:56:57 2015 UTC,"Most elite PG's in this league can beat someone one on one at this point and create their own shots. Is that the end all and be all of point guards in the NBA? No.  Like I've said, his passing game looks fantastic, and his shot finally came alive, he's showing good tools that could lead to him being an elite guard. However, pretending he hasn't shown flaws either is stupid, lets be honest with our assessments here, hes shown mediocre speed, it may not end up mattering or it may be absolutely nothing and hes just not used to having to play at full speed all the time, but so far it is a real flaw."
lakers,3dp0wz,Notalent13,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:56:53 2015 UTC,"He can have mediocre speed as long as his handles are good that will come with time and practice.  My other worry is finishing at the rim he looks a little awkward but that is something he will improve with practice too.  Russell Westbrook is breakneck speed, but Curry and Harden aren't fast they just dribble and in hardens case he finishes at the rim well with either contact for free throws or a bucket.    He will get his go to moves in time"
lakers,3dp0wz,oZiix,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:42:31 2015 UTC,"Being able to create one on one and beat guys off the dribble could push him to superstar status. He has a very good shot that he could get off in little space and is a tremendous passer. That alone will make him an elite guard, like you I'm a bit concerned about his speed, but in the end he will still be one of the best point guards out there. The lack of speed is what is going to make him hard to be THE best  point guard out there I think."

lakers,3dp0wz,Dimatizer,12,Sat Jul 18 18:43:44 2015 UTC,That kid has a ton of upside. He just has to learn to put it all together.  Would still rather him then Okafor anyday.
lakers,3dp0wz,beencotstealin,12,Sat Jul 18 03:21:08 2015 UTC,I agree. Lakers won't let this kid become a bust. They will do everything. To make him a star caliber player. With Okafor we pretty much know what he is as a player. Maybe improved his game a bit more and thats it.
lakers,3dp0wz,FuriousFlex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:49:16 2015 UTC,"Yup what we see in Okafor now will most likely who he will be in the coming years. He will get stronger, but his skills are already way advanced for any person of his age and height."
lakers,3dp0wz,Jan-22-2006,10,Sat Jul 18 05:56:11 2015 UTC,I am fully on the Dlo Bandwagon but in what universe is this a bad thing about Okafor? He's already got super skilled moves and he's going to get stronger and improve his basketball IQ. He's going to be really really good.
lakers,3dp0wz,WelcomeToBoshwitz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:03:13 2015 UTC,"I may have phrased it in a way that speaks poorly of Okafor. It was actually a praise, especially the last part."
lakers,3dp0wz,Jan-22-2006,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"exactly, its more that Okafor already plays at a 25 y/o level at 19 rather than he will be at a 19 level when 25."
lakers,3dp0wz,lufty574,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:06:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think enough people are concerned about Okafors weight. He's 6'10"" 270 at 19 years old. In all likelihood he's not gonna slim down and that's a lot of weight to carry on his frame. Keep in mind when we drafted Bynum he was a chubby high school kid at 7'0"" 275.   I think Jah will have a successful, yet short career. Whereas Russell could be a top 10 PG for over a decade. I'd much rather take the player with more longevity when drafting in the the top 3."
lakers,3dp0wz,CalmerThanYouAreDood,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:56:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not one to hate on the pick, Mitch has forgotten more about bball than I'll ever know. Honestly just looking at Okafor he doesnt look too overweight, I'm sure his team's training staff will figure out if he needs to lose weight. Ive also only been watching basketball for about 3-4 years so my frame of reference on draft picks is quite limited."
lakers,3dp0wz,lufty574,3,Sun Jul 19 06:43:42 2015 UTC,borderline all of his buckets are straight up swishes. it's a nice thing to hear

lakers,3dp0wz,XPostLinker,3,Sat Jul 18 02:16:25 2015 UTC,"Watched him live for the 3rd time in this summer league, this was by far his best game! I wish they allowed him to have more possession of the ball and create on his own. There was a few times tonight where he would pass the ball to Clarkson before he even crossed the half court line. They need to run more pick and roll for him at the top of the key and let him create. The defense will collapse and he will kick it out to the open man! He is really good, you can see how comfortable he is on the court and the game comes so easily to him. I just worry with the Princeton offense that he won't have the best opportunity to succeed. Doe kid is a beast!!!"
lakers,3dp0wz,kokuz,2,Sat Jul 18 05:22:39 2015 UTC,He uses his body really well. That's some old man booty dribble there.
lakers,3dp0wz,holyevilcow,2,Sat Jul 18 11:49:04 2015 UTC,I guess the problem was playing together with Clarkson. Both of them need the ball to score. Wonders if we will play them in the backcourt together.
lakers,3dp0wz,WVS_SoShi,0,Sat Jul 18 04:09:36 2015 UTC,Might not be a popular opinion but I would have Clarkson come off the bench. The team is much stronger when Russell can create and set up guys with open looks.
lakers,3dp0wz,kokuz,5,Sat Jul 18 05:24:58 2015 UTC,"I would go the other way around. Clarkson needs to start. At this point is way better than Russell. Plus Russell could develop at a more comfortable pace not having Kobe yelling at him for the ball. With the second unit he could have the ball all the time. Ideally though, I want him starting with clarkson."
lakers,3dp0wz,GoingBackToMyWays,2,Sat Jul 18 14:57:04 2015 UTC,"I'm glad he finally had a good shooting night, but he seems to be settling for a lot of long 2s."

lakers,3dp0wz,yatrickmith,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:08:28 2015 UTC,"I would say he will naturally feel more comfortable the more he plays in the nba. The thing he needs to work on most would be drawing fouls. He doesn't jump out of the gym, so he needs to start driving and drawing fouls like harden if he wants to be successful"

lakers,3dp0wz,welmoe,0,Sat Jul 18 19:02:13 2015 UTC,"He has so much harden in his game it's ridiculous, sure neither have top end speed, but their craftiness helps them excel.  All of those mid range jumpers off of high picks were exactly what was killing the Warriors last year.  I'm not getting ahead of myself, it'll take some a few years for him to adjust to the speed of the NBA, but he's going to be really good"
lakers,3dp0wz,hillcresthunter,-4,Sat Jul 18 18:10:52 2015 UTC,"WE GOT OUR GUY!  Nicknames yet?  How about ""The Doctor"" (Doctor = DR = D'Angelo Russell)"
lakers,3dp0wz,AGKontis,-18,Sat Jul 18 13:52:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah his shooting is good, especially off the PnR.   I'm still concerned about his ability to get past his defenders without the usage of screens, which kind of stems back to his lack of athleticism.  Fuck ohio state"
lakers,3drtfx,dashan987,46,Sat Jul 18 21:06:22 2015 UTC,"That's correct Byron, D'Angelo Russell is not Magic Johnson."

lakers,3drdd0,ShaneMichaelOfficial,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:18:32 2015 UTC,I can't say if the ratings are accurate I didn't watch a ton SL games other than ours. I do think it is definitely possible that he isn't a hater at all. Being the number two and seven pick comes with expectations. When your picked by the lakers there are more expectations. Neither was very good in he summer league maybe he just thought they didn't perform up to potential.
lakers,3drdd0,FreshDiamond,17,Sun Jul 19 10:18:07 2015 UTC,how to get website traffic: say lakers rookies are disappointing or say a player is interested in being traded to the lakers
lakers,3drdd0,subtle_penguin,3,Sat Jul 18 19:29:32 2015 UTC,Exactly. These types of posts should have the link in the text so we can avoid driving traffic to trolls. Don't dislike Pelton but I think he knows this is gonna get him significant clicks from annoyed Laker fans.
lakers,3drdd0,ThomasFurke,7,Sat Jul 18 20:43:15 2015 UTC,The link I posted is not the actual ESPN page. It's a link to a Chinese webpage that has the full text of the article (the article is Insider). ESPN's not getting any traffic from this.
lakers,3drdd0,ThomasFurke,3,Sat Jul 18 20:54:42 2015 UTC,"My bad, meant in general, not specifically yours."
lakers,3drdd0,swookilla,3,Sat Jul 18 22:24:15 2015 UTC,np. I agree with you. ESPN in general has become a haven for clickbait and poor articles.

lakers,3drdd0,redundantPOINT,3,Sun Jul 19 00:41:02 2015 UTC,"How does Okafor not make his top 3?  He was better than all those guys and it wasn't even close, and he did it over two different SLs."
lakers,3drdd0,arkansastraffic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:57:12 2015 UTC,I agree only because I had such high (and unfair) expectations for both Russell and Randle.   Of course it doesn't matter what I was expecting and why I'm disappointed.   And it doesn't matter what Pelton thinks either.
lakers,3drdd0,misterrunon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:31:02 2015 UTC,"DLO was for sure the most disappointing rookie considering his performance and how high he was drafted.  That being said, Randle being added to the most disappointing veterans is unfair. Kid isn't a veteran. A few minutes of NBA play then breaking his leg doesn't make him a veteran. He was cleared for 5 on 5s right as SL happened. Of course there's going to be some rust...he hadn't played any real basketball for like 9 months."
lakers,3drdd0,lakeshow2015,0,Sun Jul 19 07:29:00 2015 UTC,"Here's my problem with his shooting: He compared D'Angelo's college shooting numbers from 3, but I think D'Angelo is having issues adjusting to the NBA 3. His shot looks really off. Doesn't get enough lift from his legs - he doesn't need the lift from midrange, but he needs it from the 3."

lakers,3doqzl,FuriousFlex,21,Sat Jul 18 01:08:09 2015 UTC,Why are more people worried about the outcome of a consolation summer league game than Russell's performance? He killed it today and should silence a few pessimists here on this sub
lakers,3doqzl,Sickfire22,3,Sat Jul 18 01:07:20 2015 UTC,Fuck pessimists.
lakers,3doqzl,KingNg,2,Sat Jul 18 01:47:27 2015 UTC,My view on it is 1/2 our summer league team is on our roster. Therefore we should be kicking ass or at least have are starters be explosive.   Again I emphasize this is my own opinion and I am not claiming to be a n expert.
lakers,3doqzl,Misinformed_Larry,5,Sat Jul 18 05:34:24 2015 UTC,"In the SL they work more on trying to see what players CAN'T do than what they can do.  So you might not see players at their best in these games.  You would worry if someone like Jordan Clarkson or Zach Lavine come in and struggle, because usually a year of NBA practices is enough to elevate a player past summer league talent (but thankfully they didn't).  But there's no predicting a rookie's regular season at all based off of SL player."
lakers,3doqzl,C3PO1Fan,3,Sat Jul 18 06:03:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, clarkson was pretty disappointing this whole summer league for me. He was decent but he didn't exactly display that he was dominant over the rookies. What was most notable was how awful our offensive sets were and seemed designed to not play to the strengths of clarksons or Russell's skills. Every possession clarkson and Russell seemed to pass back and forth, then use a half hearted screen or drive in the last seconds of the shot clock."
lakers,3doqzl,KookLife,20,Sat Jul 18 15:08:41 2015 UTC,That was frustrating to watch. Utah was shooting free throws almost every possession.
lakers,3doqzl,mfattahi24,3,Sat Jul 18 00:37:53 2015 UTC,Yeah it was really frustrating. Utah got so many dumb calls.

I didn't feel they were that much more aggressive. It was such a blatant abuse of power. It was awful to watch. Whistle on every single play. They almost scored half their points on free throws

lakers,3doqzl,misterrunon,8,Sat Jul 18 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"He shot 50%, he just missed a majority of his 3s and didn't take any free throws."
lakers,3doqzl,BeefCat10,4,Sat Jul 18 01:00:26 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the logic behind this. The only way to score 21 points on fewer shots is to either shoot more 3's, get to the line more, or shoot more efficiently than he already did (50% FG is good)."
lakers,3doqzl,chrisle991,4,Sat Jul 18 01:01:16 2015 UTC,"The fascination with the 3 ball and how that plays into efficiency is overrated. Dude shot 50% in the mid range this game, which is perfectly acceptable."
lakers,3doqzl,WillTheGreat,13,Sat Jul 18 01:03:54 2015 UTC,This game made me realize that we potentially have 4 starters that can take the ball up the court and make plays.   There's gonna be some nice fast breaks.

lakers,3doqzl,JustAGuy993,11,Mon Jul 20 04:42:45 2015 UTC,"Not sure whether it was a coaching decision or if the players froze him out. However for D'Angelo to not touch the ball once in the last 2 minutes of the game on offense is inexcusable. Why are we running plays that result in Randle catching the ball 20 feet away from the basket, and then asking him to be the playmaker. Obviously it doesn't matter because it is summer league, but the players are there to develop. You can't just not give the ball to Russell in situations where he is clearly going to be expected to handle the ball. He looked great in the 2nd half, and then he wasn't allowed to handle the ball at the end of the game."
lakers,3doqzl,BeefCat10,15,Sat Jul 18 01:07:20 2015 UTC,Welcome to the Princeton Offense.  Hopefully Byron scraps it. Just doesn't fucking work with DLO's game and we honestly should be bending over backwards for him at this point.

lakers,3doqzl,ashishvp,2,Sat Jul 18 06:43:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. Honestly, pretty much everyone we had out there looked flustered every time they got the ball the last couple minutes. Save for Dlo cause he didn't even touch it."
lakers,3doqzl,ceelogreen5,6,Mon Jul 20 04:43:55 2015 UTC,"Defense was out of sync (I think we had like 3 blocked shots). Refs sucked too, but we can't look for excuses (we're better than that).Rebounding needed some work, but the hustle was there. Multiple missed shots in the beginning killed us, but D'Angelo help us with his mid-range shot. Randle played well; still rusty, but he's passing and driving. Russell was the ""most improved""! Impressed with his jumper and passing. Black had a better offensive game, but we need him on the defensive game. Clarkson was just doing his thing! No worries about him! And the Brown's, Upshaw, and Nance didn't play well, but will recover. Overall, this was a great last game! Much improvement from the first game! Counting down till October! Lakeshow!!!!"
lakers,3doqzl,Dochoa831,5,Sat Jul 18 00:46:42 2015 UTC,Russell went off but got frozen out for the rest of the game.  That was frustrating.
lakers,3doqzl,dood23,7,Sat Jul 18 00:46:51 2015 UTC,I hate how they make him inbound the ball... Like WHY!
lakers,3doqzl,Schneeky,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:47:42 2015 UTC,im guessing court-vision
lakers,3doqzl,BigGameJames42,3,Sat Jul 18 00:51:21 2015 UTC,"That actually is why. He's still plenty tall, so if a guard happens to be blocking him at the sideline he shouldn't have too much of an issue of seeing the floor. That being said, I'd really only like to have D'Lo inbound the ball in clutch situations. I mean we all know that regardless of if this is Kobe's last season or not, if he's healthy, he's getting the last shot of the game. So to have Russell on the sideline would still be alright, you could almost ensure a good pass.   If Kobe's not healthy, we need to break the habit of Swaggy getting the last shot. It should go down to either Clarkson or Russell in my opinion. At this stage in their careers, I'd rather dish the ball to Clarkson with 6 seconds left because I feel like he can make a better play with the ball than D'Angelo could, today. So even in that scenario, I'm fine with D'Angelo inbounding the ball trying to find Clarkson.   Sorry I'm high & ranting lol."

lakers,3doqzl,rl3191,5,Sat Jul 18 01:15:31 2015 UTC,"Young Russ played great. Would have had a lot more assists if his teammates were hitting their wide open shots he was creating for them. Great floor managing per usual. Not exactly efficient but got 21 points on 50% shooting! His midrange after getting some daylight is absolute money. The three will get there soon enough. Wish he would drive it more because he looks to be pretty good at finishing with contact.  One thing that's surprised me this entire SL is that he's been playing good defense. Tonight he played great defense. Not even a homer exaggeration, he was doing a damned good job.  At the very least it shows improvement. Only 2 TOs, too!"
lakers,3doqzl,arkansastraffic,2,Sat Jul 18 00:52:00 2015 UTC,Does anyone know why Upshaw got so few minutes?
lakers,3doqzl,Wa1do,16,Sat Jul 18 01:28:42 2015 UTC,He can't keep up on the floor. He needs conditioning because he hasn't played since he was released from Washington.
lakers,3doqzl,jon_snow_jones,2,Sat Jul 18 00:41:13 2015 UTC,"I'm excited for this season. We really have a young core we can build on.  However, DLo really hates going right. Hope he develops that eventually. He can't always settle for jumpers when going right"

lakers,3dpch2,wuck_fes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:09:18 2015 UTC,"Just incredible bro. His drive and fearless mentality is one of, if not, the best characteristic of his game. I believe in his final year at mizzou his numbers fell by a significant amount because of his personal problems with finding out his dad had cancer. Thankfully his dad recovered fully and in the process we picked up a JC that's back to form of what should have been a top 20 1st rounder. The cards fell in the right places and he's on route to making a ton of fucking money landing in our rebuilding situation. Things just happen for a reason I guess but it all works out for everybody."

lakers,3dqk9o,Buckelroo,-1,Sat Jul 18 15:06:16 2015 UTC,I think that depends on how that meeting goes. Pretty sure that is the point of the meeting
lakers,3dqk9o,FreshDiamond,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:40:33 2015 UTC,They will probably sign him. The meeting will be more about his attitude and how he plans to be a pro and stay away from all the distractions. Possibly with few incentives and non guarantees if he doesn't meet certain criteria
lakers,3dqk9o,riceballa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:07:47 2015 UTC,I expect them to sign him too I'm just saying I think the meeting is mostly for Mitch to meet him and make sure he isn't a total duck

I'd like to see him make his millions with it though. Harder to argue against millions once you've got it. He can ball!!!!
lakers,3dqbtx,KingNg,12,Sat Jul 18 12:27:27 2015 UTC,"I've posted this quote before, I will post it again.  ""Man let me tell you something, I've said this before, I want my accountant from Princeton, I don't want my damn offense from Princeton. ""   Charles Barkley"
lakers,3dqbtx,Titanosaurus,3,Sat Jul 18 15:35:12 2015 UTC,"Most of the time, the offense will run through russel, randle or jc. When the opposing defense finds a way to smother and limit their effectiveness, the Princeton will act as a half court set to keep the defense guessing.   From wikipedia:   The Princeton offense is an offensive basketball strategy which emphasizes constant motion, passing, back-door cuts, picks on and off the ball, and disciplined teamwork.    Many would disagree, but I think it's the kind of offense that d angelo can thrive in with his passing."
lakers,3dqbtx,Holajuwon34,4,Sat Jul 18 19:35:15 2015 UTC,"Outdated offense. Most annoyingly it doesn't compliment our young players skilksets, so I feel like it limits them. If we had (whispers) Mike D'Antoni's offense, they'd fare much better. Or any offense that involves a lot of pick and roll."
lakers,3dqbtx,Scarlatina,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:44:49 2015 UTC,Byron Scott doesn't strike me as the type of coach that can adapt to his roster. Instead Scott will stubbornly try to get a square peg to fit in a round hole until he breaks it.
lakers,3dqbtx,aveydey,5,Sat Jul 18 18:58:31 2015 UTC,You just described Mike D'Antoni when he made one of the greatest post players of all time stand outside and shoot 3s...
lakers,3dqbtx,ConstableOfGrammar,0,Sat Jul 18 19:22:20 2015 UTC,Yeah but D'Antoni is different and much more gooder because the one of the best pick and roll players ever paired with the best roll man of all time proves that his offense always works no matter who is on the floor. /s

lakers,3dqbtx,buhhboyy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:48:35 2015 UTC,"The Princeton is a fine offense to work with, I just don't think Byron is capable of making it run as smoothly as the way the Spurs use it. Then again the Spurs also have one of the greatest coaches ever and all their players are good and willing passers. Hopefully this is the year we really start to develop that kind of chemistry or else I don't see Byron lasting here through next season if no notable improvements are made. I have faith though."

I'm excited for Clarkson and Russell. Hopefully nash turns out to be like Hakeem the dream and help out other point guards for years.
lakers,3docs2,Venice6x7,25,Fri Jul 17 22:30:09 2015 UTC,"Athleticism has never concerned me. It's not a must to succeed in the NBA, especially if you look at the likes of Nash or Paul."
lakers,3docs2,Boostafazoom,20,Fri Jul 17 22:44:12 2015 UTC,"One thing I have noticed about D'Angelo Russell, despite all the knocks on his athleticism, is that he does a better job than Clarkson at staying in front of his man. Very rarely is he beat off the dribble in 1on1 situations. His defensive lapses come off of back door cuts where he's caught ball watching. But his 1on1 defense in terms of footwork and lateral quickness is actually pretty good"
lakers,3docs2,thranduil-,3,Fri Jul 17 23:29:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed, he's doing a great job staying in front of his man. Hopefully it translates to the big stage."
lakers,3docs2,lakeshow2015,6,Sat Jul 18 02:30:33 2015 UTC,"Thats who Russell needs to pattern his game after, Nash. Passing is his greatest skill. Just make plays and sink shots when the opportunity presents itself."
lakers,3docs2,LRW35,2,Fri Jul 17 23:17:12 2015 UTC,He said he draws from Stephen Curry which is just as good
lakers,3docs2,TuneHD,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:39:58 2015 UTC,if he learns to tighten up his dribble a bit i can see that kind of game from him
lakers,3docs2,noerapenal,2,Fri Jul 17 23:48:33 2015 UTC,"I think he will, hes crafty and smart."
lakers,3docs2,LRW35,9,Fri Jul 17 23:54:41 2015 UTC,CP3 was incredibly athletic. Otherwise I totally agree with you. We drafted Russell because of his passing ability and what's between his ears.
lakers,3docs2,amarstan,6,Fri Jul 17 23:03:04 2015 UTC,"He was incredibly athletic but he's lost more than a step, and has remained highly effective."
lakers,3docs2,ceelogreen5,3,Fri Jul 17 23:51:35 2015 UTC,"We're comparing CP3 to Russell. It makes sense that we'd be referring to CP3 out of the draft, not the current elder CP3.  Nash is a better comparison because he was never particularly athletic. No step for him to drop."
lakers,3docs2,amarstan,5,Sat Jul 18 00:47:33 2015 UTC,"Why though? CP3 can't use his athleticism from 2005 anymore. I get that he has 10 years of experience under his belt which helps tremendously, but the whole point is that you can compensate for a lack of elite athleticism with elite skill and decision-making."
lakers,3docs2,ceelogreen5,7,Sat Jul 18 00:54:46 2015 UTC,"Because they're able to succeed for different reasons. CP3, like all the other greats (Jordan, Kobe, etc.), originally had a lot of athleticism. He could rely on it to supplement his game and succeed as an NBA player while learning and developing a considerable amount of experience.  Then when CP3 (and all the others) lost a step, he could rely on the experience he's had from the previous years to develop his game in a way to accommodate his lack of experience. He had a basis of knowledge to work from because hed played in the NBA for years.  Here, Russell is a 19 year old kid who doesn't have any NBA experience to draw on. He must succeed or fail from the beginning without athleticism, similar to Steve Nash. This means a much, much more difficult adjustment process. As big a fan of DLo as I've been since before the lottery, I've always thought he would have a long slow development process because his game will be all mental and he needs that XP... similar to Steve Nash."
lakers,3docs2,amarstan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:23:44 2015 UTC,"Those are fair points. I still think it's valid to bring up older guys when the question of athleticism gets brought up, but you're right, it makes more sense to compare him to guys like Nash."
lakers,3docs2,ceelogreen5,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:20:08 2015 UTC,The constants I find with both those guys are that they're crafty with their handles and have deadly mid-range games. I hope D'lo can work with Nash a bit to work on his craftiness with the ball to pick his spots for some easy layups/mid-range jumpers. Also opens up the lanes for some sweet dishes to teammates. That would be a treat to watch.
lakers,3docs2,CHUN_BUNS,-2,Sat Jul 18 06:42:25 2015 UTC,"Comparing him to Nash is a total joke. They're nothing like each other. Nash is one of a handful of players in NBA history to shoot 50-40-90 in a season. In fact, I'm fairly certain he did it twice. By any standard measurement, Nash is one of the best shooters in NBA history. He's also got quicks. Russell is slow as dirt and there's no way he shoots that well. I'm telling you guys, look at Deron Williams. Unathletic, big bodied PG who can see the court. That's his more accurate comp."
lakers,3docs2,USCTrojanMJB,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:42:32 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying about Nash being a great shooter, and I'm not saying Russell will ever be that great of a shooter but he shot over 40% from 3 as a freshman in college on a bad team. He's a very good shooter; So I don't know why you have to be so extreme. Russell is slow as dirt? That's simply an exaggeration, and frankly not even relevant since Nash wasn't ever the most athletic guy. Lastly, I don't get why a Deron Williams comparison is any better than the Nash. He's strong and powerful, whereas, Russell is long and skinny, more like Nash..."
lakers,3docs2,ceelogreen5,-2,Sat Jul 18 03:03:28 2015 UTC,"When Russell can't beat summer league guys off the dribble, he's slow as dirt. Period."

lakers,3docs2,knightfall88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:23:58 2015 UTC,"Nash and Paul have been two of the quickest players in the league during their primes. Nash could have played professional soccer, and Paul was routinely regarded as one of the fastest end to end players in the league, pushing the ball in 3-4 superhuman seconds. How the heck you could compare D'Angelo to them athletically is certifiably insane."
lakers,3docs2,USCTrojanMJB,7,Sat Jul 18 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"he's not even done growing. couple that with the workouts he'll go through and athleticism wont be a problem at all, especially when his game is predicated on courtvision and passing. if he's able to develop more quickness and get to the rim better over the next couple years that's just a bonus."
lakers,3docs2,jordanthejordna,3,Fri Jul 17 23:17:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. Russell is going to be interesting to watch develop, if anything. He has a very unique style and approach, and I haven't quite figured out what those two things are and just how awesome he is going to be. If he can get things humming around him, in time, then I foresee a return of Showtime!"
lakers,3docs2,icouldbesurfing,3,Sat Jul 18 05:20:11 2015 UTC,Pistons fan here. He's always reminded me of Brandon Roy's game he's not explosive but to say he isn't athletic is crazy. He has insane body control and is smooth. He's like DWill in his ability to keep someone on his hip at all times. It's a beauty to watch.
lakers,3docs2,WMUKirk,3,Sat Jul 18 15:17:02 2015 UTC,"There's a reason why Clarkson was, far and away, our best player in SL. He's older, stronger, and, most importantly, has a full season's worth of experience. Give D'Angelo time to adjust to the game pace, shot clock, get stronger, learn from Kobe/Nash, and I think he'll be fine."
lakers,3docs2,ChrisKamanMyEye,3,Sat Jul 18 02:23:44 2015 UTC,Clarkson's body development has actually been unreal. He's dunking like he's trying to make Westbrook jealous and he looks a lot more comfortable moving around as well.

At the same time he has made great plays, found his teammates, even played decent defense, and he found his shot last night.  I think the sample size is too small to make a surefire decision. Let's just watch and enjoy the growth and if we he busts we'll know later in the year.   Also who cares if someone's prediction is wrong?

Just because he is on our team doesn't mean he will be awesome. Lack of athleticism isn't the only concern though it is a big one. D Lo isn't the shoot Stephen Curry or Steve Nash were. Sure can become that and I am not saying he has too, but he doesn't finish with his right he isn't an elite ball handler and he is bad defensively. I am not saying he won't good but I am not gonna say I know he will be awesome. He was asked about his summer league turnovers and if the lanes are closing faster. His answer was hell no, I'm making bad passes and pressing. That is a piss poor answer, sure he is making some bad passes and he is playing with shitty players but the lanes do close faster and if he can't see that he is either to cocky or stupid. I'm not worried because of his summer league performance, I don't think it means much. He is thrust into a environment filled with NBA ish talent everywhere with team mates he is unfamiliar with. Everyone is trying to show out to make a roster. It's not ideal for anyone especially a pass first guy. Just cool it a little is all I'm saying, no point in having these ridiculous expectations. For what so you can say I called it Russell is a stud, you also said randle will be too. If one flops are you gonna say man I was wrong."

lakers,3docs2,StuckFern,0,Sat Jul 18 00:23:39 2015 UTC,Lol ok. If he thinks that him turning the ball over has nothing to do with playing with higher caliber athletes he is wrong and arrogant. I'm sure some of it does have to do with him pressing but a lot of it is not being used to playing with this level of athlete.
lakers,3docs2,FreshDiamond,5,Sat Jul 18 01:38:51 2015 UTC,"But his turnovers are due to him simply trying to force something that isnt there, or his teammates not anticipating a pass. when he said Hell No to the question of if the passing lanes are closing faster, he's being honest. he knows much better than you whether the passing lanes are closing quicker than he can handle.  he shoots just fine and is a capable defender on the ball, his length aids in that. he just gets caught ball watching sometimes, or he doesnt fight around screens hard enough. thats all shit that can be improved.  Tonight showed he can score just fine and can play well. whether he's a superstar or not is all up to him and the system in which he plays.   all the shit people are knitpicking is all stuff that can be improved, and im sure he'll work on it."

lakers,3docs2,USCTrojanMJB,-3,Sat Jul 18 02:46:34 2015 UTC,"First of all everything can be improved. No one comes into the league without multiple weaknesses. He is not a good defender on the ball I have watched D League guys go right around him off the dribble in Summer League and a big reason OSU played so much zone is because he couldn't guard. That doesn't mean he will never be a good defender but he isn't right now. I said nothing negative about his shooting. The lanes definitely are closing faster whether him you or anyone admits and they going to close even faster when the real basketball starts. Most importantly true superstars are superstars no matter the system.   I have nothing against D Lo. I am not discouraged by his D League performance nor am I excited about tonight. The D league is really insignificant. Its nice to see your young guys get out there but it is nothing like real NBA basketball. I am not knitpicking shit, someone made a silly post about how they Russell is a stud and people need to shut up about his athleticism. I simply laid out some of the other troublesome issues that IMO don't matter until about January. If we aren't seeing improvement that late into the season I will worry. I am not a sky is falling fan nor am I a ""OMG THE LAKERS DRAFTED 5 GUYS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THEY WILL ALL BE ALL STARS"" kind of fan. Both are dumb everybody chill"
lakers,3docs2,FreshDiamond,3,Sat Jul 18 01:34:09 2015 UTC,His on ball defense has actually been pretty good...

lakers,3docs2,FreshDiamond,-2,Sat Jul 18 00:40:01 2015 UTC,So because you saw one good summer game from D Lo and a couple flashy passes you think anyone who has reservations needs to chill. Again I think the summer is insignificant but there was far more negative to go on than positive as far as D Lo is concerned. I curious what you observed to make you so sure
lakers,3docs2,FreshDiamond,3,Sat Jul 18 01:42:21 2015 UTC,One good game? I'll assume you are talking about the game today...well I made this post before the game even started. He has shown the potential I mention in every game before today. I'm not sure what you expect from him right off the bat.
lakers,3docs2,USCTrojanMJB,-1,Sat Jul 18 02:14:37 2015 UTC,"I don't expect anything. I have said over and over the summer league does not matter. He'll probably struggle in preseason and the first couple months of the regular season too. That doesn't matter what I will be looking for is improvement as the season goes on. You are the one who just knows he is star. I defend him to the sky is falling people and I try to lend some insight to the ""lakers drafted him so he will automatically be awesome"" fans. I am not saying you are either of those but you come out telling people to chill about his lack of athleticism and then guarantee he will be star. Your doing the exact same thing as the people your telling to chill just your opinion is opposite"
lakers,3docs2,TuneHD,-1,Sat Jul 18 02:20:34 2015 UTC,"In what way has he consistently shown this potential you speak of? He makes a couple flashy passes and he's suddenly got star potential? Give me a break!  Stars flash something over other players, and it's impossible to ignore. You walk away simply saying, wow, this guy is on another level. Russell's passing ability is not a game changing, superstar talent. It makes him Jose Calderon, Andre Miller or Deron Williams. You guys need to wake up!"

It's much, much too early to tell how D'angelo will be. A lot of players are bad when they first start off and I can see a player like D'angelo being inconsistent for a while."

lakers,3dmxn2,SpaceCowboy170,62,Fri Jul 17 16:42:31 2015 UTC,"It's got to be Kobe's team. You've got (in my opinion) the best Centre, Power Forward and Small Forward of all time, along with the second best Shooting Guard of all time. CP3 is no slouch either and he's the best PG around at the moment.   On a side note, Lebron's team is massively unbalanced. Two (three if you include Lebron) PF's who clog the lane along with Shaq at C. And what the actual hell is Westbrook doing there?"
lakers,3dmxn2,Trebolations,13,Fri Jul 17 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"I looked at Lebron's team and thought to myself... hm... shaq and lebron would be a  ridiculous combination.  Lebron made Mozgov look terrifying, imagine what he could do with shaq.  Then I saw Westbrook  (UCLA fan here) and said not a chance.    Magic with Durant, Davis and Pippen is already a crazy tall line-up that would dominate any of the other teams on the interior and beyond  the arc.    Edit: On second thought, Kobe's team would give them a run for their money.  Biggest mismatch would be Paul guarding Magic.   Paul is quick and get Magic on his heels defensively, but Magic would exploit the height of Paul to no end.  Real question is: where is Dirk in these photos?"
lakers,3dmxn2,jumbosam,16,Fri Jul 17 18:55:41 2015 UTC,I don't think Shaq needs anybody to look terrifying.

I would have to go with Magic's team because of their balance and incredible high/length. You have the Best PG of all time, the best player at making his teammates better in the 6'9"" Magic. The 6'9"" pure scorer in Durant, the ultimate defender/does everything 6'8"" Pippin, the rising athletic superstar, rim-protecting 6'10"" AD, and arguably the greatest athlete/center/rim-protector in 7'1"" Wilt.  This team beats everyone due to it's balance and hight.   Jordan's team might be the worst ""team"" not individuals.

Westbrook is insane, and I've never seen anyone attack the basket with as much violence and force as he does, but you know nothing, Mr Snow.   Iverson was the scoring champ 4 times, '00-'01 MVP, led this team to the finals, single handedly stole game 1 from an otherwise undefeated NBA run by us featuring prime Shaq and Frobe, standing at an exaggerated 6'0"" and only 165 lbs. Just take a second to understand the breadth of that resume. Children these days."

lakers,3dmxn2,sweetwattah,3,Fri Jul 17 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"Because of ""muh PER stats"""
lakers,3dmxn2,FreshDiamond,-6,Fri Jul 17 21:15:01 2015 UTC,No it's not. If you took the exact same career and put it in a six five 200 hundred pound player he would not be nearly as praised. His legacy benefits from being little.
lakers,3dmxn2,ravorg,6,Fri Jul 17 20:06:14 2015 UTC,"So why do you take away the fact that he is little? Additionally, Iverson was much more of a gifted scorer than Westbrook ever was/is. Westbrook clearly has much more athleticism, but Iverson was a prolific scorer and ballhandler. Not to mention he carried a team by himself to the finals and lost to the best playoff team of all time, and even then his team was the only one to actually win a game against them. He's much better than Westbrook is/was."
lakers,3dmxn2,FreshDiamond,-2,Fri Jul 17 20:08:52 2015 UTC,I'm not taking away the fact that he is little I just am not giving him bonus points. Their game plan was to play gritty ugly defensive basketball and have iverson shoot 30 times a game. He didn't do it by himself. He played a long side the defensive player of the year and Aaron McKee was sixth man. Yes they very well may have been the worst team to ever make the finals but that feat is more impressive on Larry Browns résumé. He got guys to play within their roles and play tough defensive basketball even though they weren't going to get any shots up. All the negative things said about Kobe are true of Allen iverson. I'm not saying he isn't a hall of fame basketball player he is just over rated.
lakers,3dmxn2,StealthRUs,2,Fri Jul 17 20:27:22 2015 UTC,"If that 6'5"" 200 pound player could drag Aaron McKie, Eric Snow, and George Lynch to the NBA finals and take a game from the Prime Shaq/Kobe Lakers damn near all by himself, then yes he would be just as praised."
lakers,3dmxn2,FreshDiamond,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:11:23 2015 UTC,I'm not saying he shouldn't. This is people's problem I say overrated and you here sucks. Great player hall of famer accomplished a ton but he is over rated.

lakers,3dmxn2,FreshDiamond,0,Fri Jul 17 20:38:52 2015 UTC,If you think me saying overrated means he is mediocre all I can do is refer to a dictionary
lakers,3dmxn2,FreshDiamond,-6,Fri Jul 17 20:59:10 2015 UTC,Lol I'm not young. Allen Iverson gets an unfair boost because he was tiny. What he accomplished at his size was incredible but he isn't one of the 20 best players of all time. Why is suddenly a better player because he was small? Kevin Durant is better than Russell Westbrook because he is a lot taller so let's just say Russ is better because he is shorter. Makes zero sense. There has never been a 50 point triple double in NBA history. Their are two players in the league capable of being the first to do that right now. LeBron James and Russ Westbrook. People need to quit sleepin on the dude. He really is the new Kobe
lakers,3dmxn2,SpaceCowboy170,4,Fri Jul 17 19:55:04 2015 UTC,"No one claims he's a top 20 player, but Russell westbrook hasn't even smelled all-time great status yet"
lakers,3dmxn2,FreshDiamond,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:18:37 2015 UTC,People do claim he is a top 20 player and I didn't say Russ is an all time great or had a better career than iverson I said right now he is better than iverson ever was.
lakers,3dmxn2,SpaceCowboy170,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:31:52 2015 UTC,He had the talent but he didn't have the success.  Anyone who claims he is top 20 is as wrong as you are right now
lakers,3dmxn2,FreshDiamond,0,Fri Jul 17 20:44:06 2015 UTC,I fail to see how I am wrong. I don't dispute that iverson is a hall of famer but he was pretty much a 42% shooter as is Russ who does EVERYTHING better. He is not the all over the floor scorer ai was but he got a taste of what he can do when he steps out of the shadow of KD. Russ is the real deal man. There is never a second that Russ isn't impacting the game when he is on the court. Not always in a positive manner as he sometimes gets out of control but the same was true of iverson
lakers,3dmxn2,SpaceCowboy170,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:09:04 2015 UTC,"Iverson's shooting suffered from being surrounded by shitty offensive players.  No disrespect to Westbrook, but if we're actually considering stats here, he has the benefit of KD relieving pressure on that end.  Iverson didn't have that in his prime.  Not to mention AI played during a time when efficiency wasn't as valued as it is now.  Now body had a reason to criticize Iverson's shooting like they do Russell's now, because the game was played differently.  To be fair, it's not like it's not that close, Brodie's elite at the moment, just like Iverson was.  But AI was playing like a mad man, and had no help on his team offensively."
lakers,3dmxn2,FreshDiamond,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:18:57 2015 UTC,"I understand and agree with most of what your saying. I think the big problem I am having here is that overrated is sort of a buzz word. People see that word and they instantly think I am saying he sucks. The game was played and to be honest in my opinion better. I think efficiency sometimes comes at the sacrifice of impact. Look at LeBron the most efficient perimeter player ever. He goes long stretches not being much of a factor. He will not force the issue. If he played the Spurs the way he played the Warriors this year he may have won his third. Balance goes both ways, you don't just want to go out and chuck it but at the same time you don't have to wait for great looks when your a great player."

lakers,3dmxn2,FreshDiamond,-6,Fri Jul 17 20:22:00 2015 UTC,"You're a moron, Russ has never been in a situation to carry his team on his own before this and they were decimated by injury in a stacked west. I guess iverson is better than Kobe too since he missed the playoffs when he and shaq split."
lakers,3dmxn2,greatblack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:20 2015 UTC,"Westbrook is a better athlete as people have said and i know he went off for a like 6 games with some insane numbers. But AI put up numbers he averaged 6 assists over his career and 2 steals on 26 points. And his team WON, westbrook wasn't even winning when he was putting up those triple doubles."
lakers,3dmxn2,FreshDiamond,2,Fri Jul 17 22:10:03 2015 UTC,Neither was Kobe the first time he had to be the guy. That was the first time Russ ever had to do that in a historically dominant western conference with his team DECIMATED by injuries.

lakers,3dmxn2,BABYPUBESS,13,Sat Jul 18 16:25:59 2015 UTC,I would go with the Kobe team based on defense and scoring. The rest really lack the defense.
lakers,3dmxn2,karl_hungas,9,Fri Jul 17 16:01:21 2015 UTC,How does the first team lack defense? There's a few elite defenders on it and their length would really bother opposing teams. Durant is 6'11 at SF and Magic is 6'9 at pg.

You have 2 of the greatest defensive bigs and 3 huge offensive players. Defensively, Wade and Jordan are huge, too. It just seems like they wouldn't mesh very well. Iverson is too ball dominant. 4: The bullies. They'll bulldoze everyone. They lack versatility though. Clogging the paint will be their biggest concern."

Team 1 definitely creates all kinds of match up problems though with lengthy players that can pretty much do it all. Team 4 makes absolutely no sense to me. Team 2 has Jordan, but highlights of Shaq absolutely shitting on The Admiral are still fresh in my head and I believe him being in the lineup brings down the team."

lakers,3dmxn2,ShaneMichaelOfficial,3,Fri Jul 17 17:47:52 2015 UTC,"I said great, it's good defense, but not great defense. Great defense is guys like prime Kobe and LeBron who can stick with their man and force them to make bad decisions or force a turnover. It's like Ricky Rubio, he's usually up there in terms of steals, but he can't keep up with anyone which makes him a poor defender. When it comes to PGs their main job is to stay in front of their man so they can't just blow by and attack the rim or make a lot of space for a good shot."

lakers,3dmxn2,AboveBall,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:47:49 2015 UTC,"I think they are all very good teams but I think MJ's team can beat anyone on paper ( followed by kobes). They are all athletic (assuming we are taking everyone in their prime) and can create their own shot. If you neutralize Mj with pippen, then you leave iverson to dance around a lineup that is too slow. Lebron's team is scary and westbrook would give iverson some trouble but his 3 isn't that reliable yet and he would have a hard time penetrating with olajuwon and robinson in the paint. If you take barkley to the perimeter as well, he's going to get exposed. kobe's team is good and would probably win the most games against MJ, but I don't think there is enough athleticism there. If kobe draws MJ it leaves bird to cover wade and that aint happening (you can argue bird can post up wade but he most likely is less efficient after  having to guard wade). As much as I love kareem, I think olajuwon has the edge. Both finesse players but olajuwon has more athleticism. I also think a prime robinson is better than duncan. Duncan is no slouch but Robinson was a very dominant center who didn't get a good enough supporting staff to win a chip until he was beginning to decline. He often gets overlooked as well during a golden era of centers (shaq, olajuwon, ewing, etc). I think kobe vs mj and chris vs i3 is a tossup at best but the edge is ultimately to mjs team."

lakers,3dog2f,C3PO1Fan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:20:27 2015 UTC,"A lot of people who don't watch a lot of Clarkson have this same analysis of him, and someone like Aldridge, who's super busy, probably didn't watch much of Clarkson to end the season since he was mostly thriving once the Lakers were super-eliminated.   So I can forgive him for thinking this way since it's the general NBA opinion.    But people's minds will change if they watch him this year in more prominent positions."
lakers,3dog2f,dalas3322,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:06:26 2015 UTC,"just one man's opinion, he is entitled to it dont get frustrated.  i personally think clarkson will have a better career then our two top draft picks."
lakers,3dog2f,1violentdrunk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:12:31 2015 UTC,I actually agreed with it. I think clarkson's ceiling is a poor man's ginobili and a great 6th man

lakers,3do9x9,XxEpicMonkee,2,Sat Jul 18 00:16:06 2015 UTC,Randle is honestly overrated unless he starts hustling on defense.

lakers,3do9x9,Citizen_of_Atlantis,4,Fri Jul 17 22:19:14 2015 UTC,Jabari has no vision. If he passed more the lanes would be more open

lakers,3do9x9,Mantis-Toboggin,4,Sat Jul 18 00:09:06 2015 UTC,So is Kobe going to play off the ball more since it looks like Russell is at his best handling the ball for majority of the possession.

lakers,3do9x9,Scabandiri,4,Sat Jul 18 00:15:19 2015 UTC,Absolutely ridiculous that Russell didn't touch the ball in the last 2 minutes. Instead we got to watch Randle handle the ball like a bull in china shop.

lakers,3do9x9,Citizen_of_Atlantis,3,Fri Jul 17 22:42:53 2015 UTC,Loved to see DLo step up and hit the 3 after air balling the fade away on the baseline. Shows he's still got the confidence to keep shooting. It's (slowly) coming together.
lakers,3do9x9,ctyau,4,Fri Jul 17 23:04:04 2015 UTC,D'OEEE is finding his shot. When he sets himself he's legit shooting threat. CP3 looking arc to his shot too.

lakers,3dn4d6,DopeAndDoper,4,Fri Jul 17 17:04:02 2015 UTC,I think 3 years is a good time period before we can start talking bust...He won't be a bust. I'm sure of that.
lakers,3dn4d6,diondrems,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:09:46 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean... There are players who take a full fucking season or more to really hit their stride and shine in this league. People drawing conclusions off of summer league is the most cringeworthy shit ever.
lakers,3dn4d6,stevebeyten,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:12:18 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. he's playing with rookies and sophomores who drop passes and/or can't finish. Add Kobe, Bass, and Hibbert to the starting lineup, he'll be averaging a double-digit assists."
lakers,3dn4d6,cornmonkey,-29,Sat Jul 18 03:55:26 2015 UTC,"I feel like even if Russell becomes a bust laker fans will still try and deny it. Not gonna lie he looked pretty bad, now I'm already worried about him."
lakers,3dn4d6,stezey23,9,Fri Jul 17 18:29:27 2015 UTC,3 games into his professional career and you're worried...wow. Maybe be worried after year 1 and he looks like Darius Morris
lakers,3dn4d6,ctyau,3,Fri Jul 17 18:35:49 2015 UTC,"After 100 minutes in SL on a team of borderline NBA players (mostly) with no team chemistry/history, absurdly high expectations, all the while making the transition from college ball to pro?  Also, Mark Madsen"

lakers,3dn4d6,holyevilcow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:35:12 2015 UTC,Naaaah. Im really not worried. Look up what players like Nash and Stockton averaged in their first year. Then look at how old they were that year
lakers,3dn4d6,ashishvp,14,Mon Jul 20 04:56:06 2015 UTC,"I can't even imagine how annoying everyone will be if he gets off to a slow start in the regular season. As long as he shows us flashes of potential, which he has, I'll be happy and hopeful for the future."
lakers,3dn4d6,BABYPUBESS,3,Fri Jul 17 17:38:47 2015 UTC,If he gets off to a slow start?  That's pretty much going to happen.  People who expect otherwise shouldn't bother watching until after the All Star break.
lakers,3dn4d6,StealthRUs,5,Fri Jul 17 20:40:27 2015 UTC,I've been considering unsubbing from /r/NBA and /r/Lakers for a good chunk of the season.
lakers,3dn4d6,ape_cage,6,Fri Jul 17 17:54:40 2015 UTC,"/r/lakers probably won't get that bad, but /r/NBA is going to be ruthless"
lakers,3dn4d6,DopeAndDoper,11,Fri Jul 17 18:35:35 2015 UTC,"I find /r/lakers more wishy-washy and blinded by fandom, berating DLO more often.  At least with /r/NBA the logical voices tend to shut up the wishy-washy ones."
lakers,3dn4d6,baabaabilly,4,Fri Jul 17 21:08:04 2015 UTC,Well I think Mudiay isnt getting as much hate because he makes really flashy plays that make you salivate at his potential. His weak side passes and drive game are really nice while russell is playing on the same level as Mudiay but has less of the flash that wows the average viewer. Russell is also a laker so he will draw more hate and is under more pressure
lakers,3dn4d6,yaboi_95,8,Fri Jul 17 17:12:33 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is that Mudiay is drawing defenders,  he's drawing a double team each time he gets the ball,  and not worried about field goal % or turnovers with DLo,  alot of players come in cold,  but what I am worried is that he looks slow,  slower  than I thought,  he can't break down his defenders doesn't command a double  team,  etc..  Dlo  hasn't shown he could do any of the things Mudiay is doing right now,  but I think Russell could improve once his shot starts falling,  he fixes his handle a little bit,  so I'm not calling him a bust,  but I am concerned..."
lakers,3dn4d6,Vottomatic,2,Fri Jul 17 20:32:10 2015 UTC,"Good points. Yeah, it's easier to see Mudiay's talent (and pinpoint his faults, like his shooting). I admit, I watch Mudiay and I go ""ooh"" and ""aah"". He's fun guy to watch, and it's easy to see what he's doing well (and easier to know how to stop him).   I think with Russell, he's more cerebral, more measured in his approach, so Lakers fan can't appreciate him right away. Russell will do the hockey assist, the pass that leads to the assist, and will give up the ball if it's the right thing for the team. You can see him also try to improve the (bad) team spacing on the team, and still work within that. In one of the mic'd up videos on NBA TV, you can hear Russell telling one of the Lakers assistant coaches that he's really concentrating on getting everyone involved. That's his primarily goal.  Russell is kind of like a taller, and better Derek Fisher. Fisher had a huge effect on the Lakers team, increasing everyone's confidence, corralling Kobe's need for the ball, a leader on the floor and in the locker room. I see Russell doing the same. A lot of intangibles, that the average fan can't see.  In the long run, I think Russell is the type of guy that will be harder to stop. Once his shots start falling, the players learn to space out better, and how to receive his passes, he'll be more multi-dimensional than Mudiay.  Even then, though, people may not appreciate his talents."
lakers,3dn4d6,UltraFlyingTurtle,6,Fri Jul 17 20:16:27 2015 UTC,"The thing is Russell can't get by anyone one on one :( he's too slow..., all Mudiay needs to do is fix his shot,  which doesn't look too bad,  Russell ain't going to get anymore athletic..."
lakers,3dn4d6,Vottomatic,2,Fri Jul 17 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Russell won't get more athletic, and that does make me sad, but I do think he can improve his ball-handling and learn to get separation especially because he'll be working with Nash. Nonathletic guys like Nash and John Stockton managed to improve and get by their guys because of craftiness. Plus Russell, in college, he has shown some glimpses of this. He won't ever be explosive like Mudiay or even Clarkson, but I do think he has avenues to improve in that area so he won't look so slow.  As for Mudiay's shot -- I'm sure he'll get better, and I like the dude. Future all-star potential there, but not sure his shot will become elite. Maybe that's good enough for Mudiay to have a great career, but I do see elite shooting potential with Russell -- he shot 41% behind the arc in college, and he shot even better percentage at 24+ feet, which is NBA range.  At a high volume, too, as he was OSU's primary scorer.  Mudiay's free throw percentage (high school, and in China) I heard was in the 60s, so it doesn't give me hope that it'll be that easy to fix. Lots of PGs have been working on improving their shot, and it hasn't happened, like Ricky Rubio, Jennings, etc. Mudiay's such is an unknown though, so maybe he's improved his shooting (I haven't seen it yet so far), but for Denver fans, I'd still be happy to have him.  Russell's free throw percentage was about the same as Harden's in college, around the mid-70s, so combined with Russell's elite 3-point shooting in college (he was in the top 5), I think he has the potential to be elite in the NBA.  But, yeah, I admit, I do have concerns about Russell, and I know you're not bashing Russell. Just giving your honest assessment based on what we've seen so far (in Russell's limited SL minutes)."
lakers,3dn4d6,UltraFlyingTurtle,2,Fri Jul 17 21:46:17 2015 UTC,"What really frustrates me is that all of this was obvious even before the draft. When you watched Mudiay's clips, you could tell that his game would translate to the NBA. The worst case for him was that his jumper would never improve. Russell had trouble getting by guys in college ... and the fact that his stats (including his widely heralded shooting) were really poor against top 60 ranked NCAA teams really worried me -- I thought it was a warning sign that he may not be able to compete against the kind of athleticism and length he'll encounter in the NBA.  I'm hoping he'll still be a productive NBA player, but I thought there was too much risk in taking him 2nd. On the bright side, if DLo busts, there's a good chance Jim Buss will finally be forced out."
lakers,3dn4d6,toshi_X,3,Fri Jul 17 23:19:43 2015 UTC,"Russell can't even blow by Kevin Pangos and TJ Mcconnell. Mudiay could beat his defenders off the dribble, and does not make donkey ass passes or turn the ball over 8 times a game."
lakers,3dn4d6,xCoM24,2,Fri Jul 17 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"Nuggets fan here...I haven't been watching Lakers SL as much as I wanted to. In all honesty how is D'angelo looking? Is the positivity and future outlook generally bright or the other way around? I am pleased with Mudiay's play, though stats suggest otherwise."
lakers,3dn4d6,kthxtyler,3,Fri Jul 17 20:31:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I had been thinking about writing a similar post comparing D'Lo's stats to some other SL players. The fact of the matter is -- D'Lo has a long road ahead but there's absolutely no reason we should be down on him. Everything we've seen indicates that he's willing to put the work in, day in and day out. And remember he hasn't even met Kobe in person yet; D'Lo is notorious for being a game tape-aholic much like Kobe. I'm excited for the potential in this relationship. People have mocked Kobe for his relentless striving to improve to the point where he's watching game tape after game tape on team flights while others are sleeping. D'Lo is gunna be that guy next to him on the plane breaking down plays. I think we need to temper our expectations as a fanbase... we didn't draft Lebron James for christ's sake, we aren't going to the NBA finals this year, or next year, or the year after. Strap in and enjoy the rebuilding."
lakers,3dn4d6,ape_cage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:13:03 2015 UTC,"There have been tons of us trying to get all the expectations tempered.  It isn't because we are assholes, it's because we know that if you temper expectations about ROOKIES, then you don't flip your shit when they perform like ROOKIES.  Do you know how many people insist that we are going to be as high as a 6 or 7 seed?  With rookies.  If anyone tries to help manage the expectations, they are downvoted and thus goes the circlejerk."
lakers,3dn4d6,Roike,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:34:36 2015 UTC,"Why can't we extend the same positivity towards D'Angelo? The answer to that is because we are all spoiled Lakers fans.    No, it isn't.  The answer is because Russell was hyped beyond acceptable limits by the media and murmurs from FOs.  It's partially his own doing because we all remember that Russell said, ""...I'm the best player in the NBA draft."" ...on multiple occasions.  When someone says something like this, it's reasonable to expect they will be compared to the other two consensus ""best players in the draft"" who both happen to be performing at a very high level in summer league.  Mudiay didn't say it.  In fact, his status on the draft board was notably regarded as ""quiet"" so he isn't held to that standard.  It's that simple."
lakers,3dn4d6,myLeftTesticleofFury,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:15:06 2015 UTC,Mudiay is significantly more athetic. They both suck defensively tho
lakers,3dn4d6,Xeris,3,Fri Jul 17 18:36:01 2015 UTC,"Actually, Russell's on-ball defense so far in SL has been pretty damn good. Better than I expected, honestly."
lakers,3dn4d6,ape_cage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:32:23 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, The kid is not a bust. Give it some years before we can judge and be like yea it was a bust or not. He showed flashes of greatness that makes us go yea... we need more of that on a consistent level. It will eventually come in time. They need a full year of NBA gameplay to develop and learn from mistakes. Going to take time with a rebuild. Look at GSW. THey drafted and needed a few years before they got to the playoffs. Then they figured it out and won the tittle. Going to take time we need to give something a chance before jumping to conclusions."

lakers,3dn4d6,USCTrojanMJB,0,Sat Jul 18 12:33:38 2015 UTC,"Forget the stats, Mudiay has looked significantly better than D-Russ and had 1 break out game where D-Russ has had none. He has consistently gotten in the lane, bullied opponents and his mere presence on the court has wowed everybody. The reason why he struggled in the last game is he was getting doubled right when he got the ball and they began daring him to shoot which he just cant do right now.   Now, that doesn't mean Mudiay will be better because of the above or D-Russ is a bust because he's looked bad. It is just how these 2 look at this point in time."
lakers,3dn4d6,rtrainer30,0,Fri Jul 17 17:56:11 2015 UTC,"I was never on the DLo train to begin with (I was really hoping we'd take Mudiay with the #2 pick) so I admit that there's an underlying feeling of ""I told you so"" in my reaction to summer league. But right now, I haven't really seen any reason to believe DLo will become the kind of star player that Laker fans are expecting him to be, other than the fact that he was drafted so high."
lakers,3dn4d6,toshi_X,2,Fri Jul 17 18:11:12 2015 UTC,"I wanted Okafor,  but Mudiay was my 3rd pick,  I just think his tools translate alot better in the NBA"

lakers,3docr6,deepit6431,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:19:12 2015 UTC,"I know this is stating the obvious, but Kobe isn't fucking human. I have no idea how anyone can move like that. He single handedly made me fall in love with basketball and the Lakers."
lakers,3do3p2,yatrickmith,26,Fri Jul 17 21:17:05 2015 UTC,"Without a doubt.  With Cp3, a healthy less used Kobe, a happy Dwight and whatever good veterans on minimum contracts would want to play for us, wed be amazing for 5 years at least.  Then, when the cap rises, we would have been able to go after Durant to go along with cp3 and Dwight after Kobe retires.  So basically, Fuck David Stern"
lakers,3do3p2,swaggerqueen16,11,Fri Jul 17 21:42:46 2015 UTC,"So basically, Fuck David Stern   Haha. I still say this to this day. I even have family members, like my uncle, who never curses, still says this every once in awhile when we talk about Chris Paul, or the state of the Lakers."
lakers,3do3p2,UltraFlyingTurtle,6,Fri Jul 17 21:59:14 2015 UTC,"well, if chris paul came to us, kobe doesnt spend his time playing 36 minutes and guarding all the point guards in the west, and potentially doesnt rupture his achilles because of it so even if we didnt win rings we'd still have a better kobe bryant #thanksStern"
lakers,3do3p2,raofblow290,5,Fri Jul 17 21:36:40 2015 UTC,"I feel the same, and try not to think about that."
lakers,3do3p2,SpaceCowboy170,4,Fri Jul 17 21:52:05 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but who knows.  We'd have had to give up a lot to get him.  I know what the roster would look like in the case of the trade, but what would it look like if he'd signed?"
lakers,3do3p2,LeBaconator,3,Fri Jul 17 21:21:00 2015 UTC,"I don't mean right now.   But back then, weren't we giving up Pau and....someone else? Bynum or something?   We would have had CP3, Kobe, Meta, 'X' and Dwight. I think."
lakers,3do3p2,neelium,2,Fri Jul 17 21:25:27 2015 UTC,it was Odom(to New Orleans) and Pau(to Houston)
lakers,3do3p2,FreshDiamond,0,Fri Jul 17 22:10:59 2015 UTC,Dwight didn't like playing with Kobe. You think adding CP3 to the mix would've made it better?
lakers,3do3p2,Tw1987,3,Fri Jul 17 21:28:13 2015 UTC,Dwight is very concerned with what people think. It was easy to say I am going to walk away from and old Kobe coming off a torn Achilles because I have a better shot to with harden and parsons. That wouldn't have been the case if it was Kobe and Paul. Plus the lakers certainly wouldn't have struggled sooo much and maybe Kobe isn't coming off an Achilles in this fantasy.
lakers,3do3p2,FuriousFlex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"honestly, I don't know"
lakers,3do3p2,frozenelf,3,Fri Jul 17 22:19:35 2015 UTC,"I think alot of people are missing the point as well. This would have been a snowball effect to attract more free agents at a cheap price. Instead of it being the Heat Bandwagon for free agents Lakers bandwagon would have been just competitive too.  Think about it LBJ 0 championships at the time vs Kobe who has 5. Also his whole ""attitude"" thing wasn't as big of a deal until Dwight left."
lakers,3do3p2,iwatchsportsball,2,Sat Jul 18 06:17:07 2015 UTC,Cp3 would have won a few rings with Kobe. Both are alpha mentality and Phil would have still coached. Fuck stern
lakers,3do3p2,LakersRebuild,2,Fri Jul 17 22:22:37 2015 UTC,Wasn't Phil's leaving a problem between him and Jim Buss?
lakers,3do3p2,Citizen_of_Atlantis,2,Sat Jul 18 02:10:12 2015 UTC,The Chris Paul trade veto will and should go down as a MAJOR arc in Kobe's career. It is not farfetched to think the Achilles injury doesn't happen if that team doesn't struggle like it did.
lakers,3do3p2,jon_snow_jones,2,Sat Jul 18 01:45:33 2015 UTC,"Not definitely, but we would have had a helluva better chance.  Trade was giving up Pau and Odom.  We still had Bynum as a trade chip.  Hindsight tells us we shouldn't trade for Dwight.    So maybe we keep Bynum, and instead add some solid role players.  And perhaps Bynum stays motivated and decent for a few more years to chase another ring.  I mean realistically had we not done the trade to begin with and ruined the relationship with Pau and Odom, we could've signed some wing players and still be in contention.  ""Basketball Reason"" was the biggest BS in NBA history.  And David Stearn probably thought he was leaving anyways, might as well stick it to the Lakers.  Especially since Dr Jerry Buss was out of the front office by then."
lakers,3do3p2,riceballa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:26:03 2015 UTC,Yeah we would have won at least 1 more championship with Kobe + CP3 + Dwight. Sigh

lakers,3do3p2,NicDwolfwood,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:32:53 2015 UTC,"I agree.   We would have still gotten Dwight since the assets don't overlap. With CP3, Kobe and Dwight, Phil would have came back to coach. Which means regulated minutes for Kobe instead of 45/game under D'antoni. Which means no achilles tear. Phil and CP3 would have diffused the tension between Kobe and Dwight as they are similar to Kobe's mindset of 'winning above all' except they aren't as direct about it as Kobe, which is important since you have to baby Dwight and his ego.   Now a title is never guaranteed especially vs those Heat teams, but CP would have definitely had a better chance. At least get out of the 2nd round for the first time ever."

Like, I wonder if he ever thinks about if he would've been able to go to the Lakers and see how things would be different."
lakers,3do3p2,MilesC1996,0,Fri Jul 17 21:24:02 2015 UTC,"I doubt it.  I dont see Dwight sticking around. If CP3 got on DeAndre Jordan's nerves enough to nearly leave the Clippers. Then imagine how Kobe and CP3 on his ass would of drove him crazy  plus, Lakers would of given up Pau and Odom, so naw I dont see it"

lakers,3doy19,javi2123,7,Sun Jul 19 09:34:20 2015 UTC,"Steve Nash is Canadian man. He loves helping people. He is active in his own charity. I am positive if any of the Lakers want to work out, he is such a nice guy he would not hesitate.  Steve can teach the young guys drills and techniques he has developed in his entire NBA career. Hall of Famers do not just become great they work at it and develop techniques that got them there."
lakers,3doy19,projectionist88,4,Sat Jul 18 01:59:25 2015 UTC,"Nash had/has immaculate technique. If he's willing to spend time in the gym with these guys all the better; regardless of his ""Lakerness"". Maybe he can teach Russell to drive with his right hand."
lakers,3doy19,riceballa,3,Sat Jul 18 02:27:05 2015 UTC,"Well if you watched Clarkson last season, he was all over the place and was playing too fast. But he was so different and so much better after Nash worked with him. Players at this level can all play, it's more about the details and nuances that push you over the top. As Dlo is more similar to Nash than Clarkson, I think that Nash will be a greater effect on his game than he did Clarkson which is saying a lot since he really transformed JC"

I want to see him make the right basketball play, even if that means simple swing passes around the arc, making the safe pass in transition, and taking uncontested shots. Rather than prove to us he's got talent (we already know he does), I want to see him start to adapt to the NBA game and where he's at relative to that."

lakers,3dn5ck,Vottomatic,2,Fri Jul 17 17:12:21 2015 UTC,I think his comment had more to do with wondering why this was made as a separate post as opposed to just being a comment on any number of the DLo threads.  Perhaps in giving him too much benefit of the doubt though.

Sure, manufacturing processes will likely change but it's very unlikely that leatherware in particular will die out.

lakers,3dl7g1,TweetPoster,4,Fri Jul 17 04:15:04 2015 UTC,"Could someone explain to me how D'Angelo is 19, and hasn't played an NBA game yet, and also, we technically don't know if he's gonna be ""GREAT"" or not, but he gets to sign with Nike?   Do all rookies sign with Nike, Adidas, Jordan?   Or maybe D'Lo just has to wear their clothes, not necessarily getting his own shoes?"
lakers,3dl7g1,yatrickmith,7,Fri Jul 17 08:34:09 2015 UTC,He just has to wear Nike stuff. I'm sure his contract has a stipulation that he will have an opportunity to have his own sneaker line ala Kyrie Irving if he reaches certain conditions.
lakers,3dl7g1,GeraltsBeard,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:09:38 2015 UTC,"When can he not wear Nike stuff?   So he can never be seen with a plain white tee on? Or would he have to be wearing Nike shoes and shorts, but he could have a shirt from another brand?   Or is it literally all the time?"
lakers,3dl7g1,yatrickmith,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:19:14 2015 UTC,"Im not really sure about specifics of his contract. All I know is that players signed by Nike can wear other brands as long as it's not their competitor. For instance, he can wear fashion brands like Gucci or LV or Armani because those are not Nike's competitors. As for shoes, when it comes to sneakers/rubber shoes, it's just Nike for him"
lakers,3dl7g1,GeraltsBeard,7,Sat Jul 18 01:04:00 2015 UTC,There's like 150+ NBA players signed to Nike. That doesn't necessarily mean he'll ever get his own signature shoe. He just has to wear all Nike gear and shoes.
lakers,3dl7g1,CaCHooKaMan,3,Fri Jul 17 12:44:05 2015 UTC,Can Nike sponsors also wear Jordan's? Just wondering
lakers,3dl7g1,AK97u,2,Fri Jul 17 13:01:38 2015 UTC,I don't think so. Westbrook and Blake Griffin are two players sponsored by Jordan that do not wear Nike any more on the court.
lakers,3dl7g1,SushiRoe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:37:35 2015 UTC,"Yes but not vice versa I believe. For example, Nike sponsored players such as Nick Young, Cousins,  or PJ Tucker will wear Nike's one game and Jordan the next. Players signed to Jordan brand (like Westbrook, Griffin, or Chris Paul for examples) wear strictly Jordans on the court."
lakers,3dl7g1,SoCal_Indica_Girl,3,Fri Jul 17 15:15:20 2015 UTC,Over 50% of the league is signed with Nike. Signing with Nike just means he'll wear their shoes (likely Kobe's for now) not that he'll get a signature shoe line.
lakers,3dl7g1,Ksanti,3,Fri Jul 17 14:04:09 2015 UTC,Nike's guard roster getting pretty crowded. UA and Jordan would've been interesting.  And I don't think Kobe is that petty.

lakers,3dl7g1,karakarafade,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:27:13 2015 UTC,It was pretty clear that he would be a Nike athlete. He wore Nike's all throughout college since Ohio is a big Nike school. And he's been wearing Kobe's through out summer league. It would have been pretty cool to see him sign with UA.
lakers,3dl7g1,KobeBasedGod24,2,Fri Jul 17 18:45:51 2015 UTC,I'm very interested to see what dlo comes up with for his first signature shoe. Hoping he makes it suitable for outside play rather than just pure inside. It won't be as great for his pro game but it would definitely build his brand. Partly why the curry 1 is doing so well right now is because it can be used outside. Either way nice can't wait to cop it.
lakers,3dl7g1,GabrielRodriguez115,9,Fri Jul 17 06:21:37 2015 UTC,He's not going to get his own shoe anytime soon.  Every rookie signs to a sportswear brand and they mostly just get free gear as long as they solely wear that particular brand.  Here is Timofey Mozgov explaining this.  We definitely don't see any Timofey 1's in stores.
lakers,3dl7g1,rsong965,2,Fri Jul 17 08:14:19 2015 UTC,We definitely don't see any Timofey 1's in stores.   Yet. ;)
lakers,3dl7g1,badguymatt,3,Fri Jul 17 16:22:59 2015 UTC,"He won't be getting them for a long time, nike is stringent with making signature shoe lines especially when they have 4 right now.  They don't want to flood the market with too many. Just look at Harden for example. He may possibly get a signature shoe this upcoming season. And thats only because his previous nike contract ran out and now he has leverage because he's the star of a team and having a huge image with the beard and all.  The only way Dlo gets a signature shoe this season is if he shoes that he is the next coming of MJ within the first few months of play."
lakers,3dl7g1,VladDracul_III,0,Fri Jul 17 13:21:28 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, but there is a possibility with the big market he's in they'd jump straight to giving him a signature line because the laker fans."

lakers,3dpbbr,spudwinkle,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:56:41 2015 UTC,What exactly is his position? I know he can play both but is does he count as a PG or SG?
lakers,3dpbbr,riceballa,2,Sat Jul 18 22:42:55 2015 UTC,"I believe West played mainly SG for his career, but switched to PG only near the end of his career, about the time when Bill Sharman became Lakers coach in the early 70s. I think because West was getting older, and slowing down because of injuries, Sharman asked him to do more PG duties. Also because Lakers re-signed the younger Gail Goodrich, who eventually take over as main scorer at the guard position, so the aging West moved over to PG.  Throughout West's carreer, he was a good passer and had a high number of assists, but in last three years, it really went up, when he averaged 8 to 9 assists per game. I remember reading in West's biography that he was a bit hesitant to take over PG duties, but acquiesced to Sharman's request and he became one of the league's best PGs, still able to score a lot, while raking in the assists.  Anyway, I always thought of West as a shooting guard, just like Kobe -- an elite scoring guard, who happened to have such an high basketball IQ, he could pass well, just like Kobe (when he wants, too). West was such a prolific scorer, and a tall guard, and I think he sees a lot of himself in Kobe -- and that's why they have the special bond between the two of them, they are so similar (with that killer instinct).   The SG role is such a coveted position in the league, perhaps the most glamorous position, and it's no coincidence why West, ""Mr. Clutch,"" is the NBA logo."
lakers,3dpbbr,UltraFlyingTurtle,2,Sun Jul 19 09:39:58 2015 UTC,"Wow, great response. Yeah, I see West more in the SG rankings but you don't really see him in the top PG conversations. This clears a lot of that up!"
lakers,3dpbbr,riceballa,2,Sun Jul 19 17:54:25 2015 UTC,"If you're interested more in Jerry West, Roland Lazenby's book on him is really fascinating Jerry West: The Life and Legend of a Basketball Icon  While reading it, you'll get a strong sense of the Lakers history and how it's all intertwined with the present. When you think of Lakers recent glory, of Jerry West building a championship team, of Phil Jackson incorporating the triangle for multiple Lakers championshps, etc, -- seeds of all of that goes back to many decades earlier, and it's all tied to Jerry West in some way.  Jerry West started at West Virginia University, playing under coach Fred Schaus, becoming the school's star athlete, surpassing previous WVU basketball star Hot Rod Hundley.  West eventually graduates and gets drafted, by whom? The Lakers, who had also drafted Hot Rod Hundley a few years before, and guess who's coaching the Lakers now? West's old college coach, Fred Schaus.  Lakers and WVU have strong ties.  During college, Jerry West and his WVU team had some big tournament games against Kansas in the 1950s, and who coached that Kansas team? Tex Winters, the inventor of the Triangle, who would decades later influence Phil Jackson and both Tex and Phil would eventually come to the Lakers to win multiple championships for them.  Tex Winters played college ball at USC, where Bill Sharman also went to school. If I remember correctly, I think they may have played together. Sharman would later join the Celtics as a player and cause many years of frustration for West and the Lakers as rivals in the 60s. Then Sharman, as a coach, hailed as one of the league most brightest coaches,  joins the Lakers in the early 70s, to lead Jerry West and the Lakers to an NBA championship, West's only one, after coming so close many times years before. This foreshadows what Winters would do decades later as well, come as coach (with Jackson as head coach) to Lakers and win them championships.  Despite West not being with the Lakers anyone, his son Ryan West, as assistant scouting director, continues his legacy for the Lakers.  Jerry West, in so many ways, is the Lakers. And West, in so many ways, is the NBA."

lakers,3dpbbr,Mantis-Toboggin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:51:56 2015 UTC,That's what I thought too but I've seen people list him as one of the top SGs. I guess it's similar to AI in terms of whether you rank him as a PG or SG.

lakers,3dlsz0,yatrickmith,5,Fri Jul 17 08:42:21 2015 UTC,"All that proves is that both Gibson and Randle are undersized PFs. Also, wingspan and standing reach are more important that height. I would then say that body type, strength and girth is next in line in importantance before height. I dont know why people are so stuck on where the top of a players head is. They dont block shots with the top of their head."
lakers,3dlsz0,rtrainer30,2,Fri Jul 17 14:39:15 2015 UTC,"Randle has a standing reach a half inch higher than draymond green, so id say that's a much better comparison. He fared very well against him last preseason too."

lakers,3dlsz0,srekalal,-4,Fri Jul 17 14:23:48 2015 UTC,"Yup, not much explosiveness"

lakers,3dlsz0,FreshDiamond,7,Fri Jul 17 19:08:27 2015 UTC,"I just think that Randle gets knocked for his ""lack of explosiveness"" by fans who watched a couple of his UK highlights, taking contact below the rim and still finishing.   They don't understand that Julius expanded his game to play below the rim at Kentucky following his injury. You can see that he's trusting his legs again, and once he fully regains his confidence back, everyone will be reminded that he's actually very explosive and athletic, and these Zbo and Haslem comparisons will stop."
lakers,3dlsz0,bul1dog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:26:21 2015 UTC,He is athletic for a 4 but there is athletic and there is freak. He is maybe Lamar odom athletic which is not Blake griffin athletic

Randle has a long way to go be any where near Lamar."

lakers,3dlsz0,thehumangenius23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:19:03 2015 UTC,Yeah you right. I still don't know if he is as athletic as Lamar though
lakers,3dlsz0,FreshDiamond,2,Sat Jul 18 02:25:51 2015 UTC,His stature really reminds me of Udonis Haslem. Haslem in his prime is a solid PF.
lakers,3dlsz0,JRags412,2,Fri Jul 17 13:57:14 2015 UTC,"Charles Barkley is 6'6. I don't think anyone will argue he's one of the all time greats at the PF position. It's not all about the size, but the heart and the skills."
lakers,3dlsz0,morericelong,3,Fri Jul 17 17:42:40 2015 UTC,Barkley = superior athlete
lakers,3dlsz0,FreshDiamond,2,Fri Jul 17 19:09:46 2015 UTC,I don't understand why people think randle isn't isn't explosive. Explosiveness isn't just measured through someone's vertical. Randle's lateral explosion is insane.
lakers,3dlsz0,megavino,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:08:17 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't worry about it, as long as he's a work horse, he will appear bigger than he is. Look at Blake Griffin, they are both the same size in terms of height and wingspan, and he's a top 3 PF."

lakers,3dljsk,SSD65,7,Fri Jul 17 06:48:53 2015 UTC,"What do we trade? I assume our young trio are off limits. Do we move Young, Kelly, Sacre and draft picks? I say if it's with some second rounders, sure. However, we shouldn't trade any first rounders for awhile. At least not yet. Moreover, can we then trade Williams or Bass after just acquainting them? Do we even want to move them? Last, if we do acquire him, we would have a crazy guard rotation. Last year we were overloaded in the front court, now the back? This also leaves us crippled at the 3. So many variables. Next year is going to be crazy."

lakers,3dljsk,BABYPUBESS,9,Fri Jul 17 08:27:22 2015 UTC,"As Laker's fans we love to say ""how quickly they forget"" about how great Kobe was. Right now you're forgetting how good Ty Lawson was just a couple years ago. Check out his numbers, even if he's had some problems he's still a very serviceable point guard who can help the Lakers be a little more competitive in what could be Kobe's last season.  Edit: And he's only 27"
lakers,3dljsk,CalmerThanYouAreDood,0,Fri Jul 17 15:50:22 2015 UTC,It'd be a great pickup but I'd prefer to wait and see if the nuggets buy him out
lakers,3dljsk,amarstan,2,Fri Jul 17 19:28:20 2015 UTC,"Buy low. Sell high.  Ty Lawson's value can only really go up from here. If we trade for him, we likely give up nothing, we'd also have some solid guard depth.   If Russell develops into a starter in one season, we can trade Lawson. If it takes a few years for Russell to get his sea legs, then Lawson is the perfect go between assuming he can handle his issues. Then we can trade Lawson as part of a package for a star.  If Lawson flames out, we haven't given up much of anything for him."
lakers,3dljsk,Reddfoxxthepoet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:32:37 2015 UTC,That's assuming that good stock will rise. How do we know he will go back to being the ty of old? What could we get in return for a flip if we then trade him away when his stock rises if it does? I mean he would help worth depth but idk about everything else. And /u/BABYPUBESS It's not that I forget how good he was its the fact that we'll have to deal with his off the court issues that would only be amplified by being in LA
lakers,3dljsk,BABYPUBESS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:23:24 2015 UTC,"Lol. And what happens if he fucks up? He's on a deal for 2 years only, it doesn't matter. He's a quality starting point guard which we don't have right now."
lakers,3dljsk,Reddfoxxthepoet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:10:05 2015 UTC,years is enough time for someone to fuck up under contract.
lakers,3dljsk,amarstan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:03:43 2015 UTC,"No it isn't. I expressly said that his stock can't go any lower.   We're essentially going to be able to acquire him for replacement parts. So even if he goes full Lamar Odom on the Mavs, we aren't out anything much.  They cap will skyrocket next year. Kobe's deal comes off the books next year. There will be plenty of money to keep his contract even if we don't end up trading him.  This is a very low risk trade for us, with a lot of upside, and little to no downside.  As a complete aside, Ty Lawson is actually a really smart guy. He's begged Denver to let him leave repeatedly, even publicly. They've refused to do so because they feel his trade value is too high. Suddenly he picks up two DUIs with no previous known issues... his trade value has now tanked. He may very well have a legitimate problem... OR MAYBE...."
lakers,3dljsk,Mantis-Toboggin,2,Sat Jul 18 01:39:34 2015 UTC,At this point we just need proven talent. He may not be the best person off the court but when he plays he fills up the stat sheet. We need pieces like him to contend for big time players in free agency

lakers,3dljsk,Chilled_Penguin,6,Fri Jul 17 07:45:50 2015 UTC,Are you asking me if having Ty Lawson would make my team better? Thats a really stupid question lol
lakers,3dljsk,AdankPENGUIN,-14,Fri Jul 17 07:25:26 2015 UTC,That's not what I asked and you know it. You just don't wanna answer my question because you know you're being implausible with your team's aspirations next season.
lakers,3dljsk,dmedtheboss,14,Fri Jul 17 07:33:21 2015 UTC,"He said playoff push.. not title push. For a penguin, you're not very chill."
lakers,3dljsk,AdankPENGUIN,22,Fri Jul 17 07:48:34 2015 UTC,HEYOOOO
lakers,3dljsk,aveydey,-6,Fri Jul 17 08:06:46 2015 UTC,I never said anything about a title. A playoff push is implausible for this Lakers team or a Lakers team with Ty Lawson. That's my point.
lakers,3dljsk,Ksanti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:05:09 2015 UTC,"Actually, depending on how Kobe comes back its completely possible.    Lawson/Russell Clarkson/Williams Kobe/Young Randle/Bass Hibbert/Upshaw/Sacre    Dangerous scorers with Hibbert and Upshaw locking down the paint."
lakers,3dljsk,AdankPENGUIN,0,Fri Jul 17 09:43:23 2015 UTC,"Look at teams expected to make the playoffs in the west, and tell me it's possible again. Half of the playoff teams have 2 superstars and we don't even have a current star. Temper your expectations. We're rebuilding."
lakers,3dljsk,mrnailed,0,Fri Jul 17 20:20:18 2015 UTC,even though I just said that I doubt we would still make the playoffs. Nice try assuming some random shit unrelated to my comment. I would continue making fun of you but you sound like a neckbeard lol
lakers,3dljsk,firestulantz,-9,Fri Jul 17 07:50:28 2015 UTC,"You assumed your team would make a playoff push for the 8th seed which, in the west, is implausible. Did I read it wrong or is that what you meant?"
lakers,3dljsk,firestulantz,3,Fri Jul 17 08:10:42 2015 UTC,"Brush up on your reading comprehension, bro."
lakers,3dljsk,HUH_YIS,0,Fri Jul 17 09:38:47 2015 UTC,Did I read it wrong   Yes
lakers,3dljsk,WOX_69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:21:13 2015 UTC,Shit I forgot I'm on the Lakers sub where the Lakers are always one move away from contenders and any thought that conflicts with their title dreams is unwelcome! Go Lakers! 2015-2016 champs! Ty Lawson Finals MVP! Purple and gold! Here's to hoping Kobe can play 30 games next season!
lakers,3dljsk,firestulantz,0,Fri Jul 17 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"Ty Lawson is shit now. At least compared to what he was before. He obviously has issues in his personal life. Personal life issues=playing shitty  basketball. (Pau Gasol, Odom, ect.) Denver dropped him, most likely for a good reason. If we do get him it will have to be for dirt cheap. And maybe also cause we can use him for trading later. I honestly think that we will make the 8th seed if we are lucky. Maybe if enough players go off at the right time to win games. And I don't want to sound negative but I'm also dreading the day when i see our first hurt player of he year. Then gonna dread even more when I start wondering who is going to get hurt next. I think something is wrong with the health staff. Or maybe coaching staff not listening to the health staff. But our injuries in the past few years have been ridiculous and even more costly. And I'm not sold on Byron either. I think the teams he was successful on he was carried by extremely good PGs. His stubbornness against stats is worrisome too. Not to mention idk wtf Kobe is going to do. It's his last year so he might wanna shoot away at every game. And I have no idea if its going to lead to good or bad results. I kinda agree with the penguin dude. I just think maybe he worded it the wrong way. I don't really think that it is beneficial in any practical way to get Ty. Maybe they will get him rscause the media is probably getting to Bus on how D-Russ is doing ""bad"". But I'm just basing this one what I see and read. And NBA history for past few years. Again, I don't want to sound negative but I can't help feeling this way. Especially since for the 3-4 years we've been trying to rebuild every year before the season starts we talk about how exciting this year is gonna be. I'm just tired of being disappointed I guess. But I'm definitely excited to see our rooks play but in terms of the team in general, they need to prove to us that they deserve our optimism and hopefulness. I'm not saying I'm write or wrong and obviously is up to debate. This is just the conclusion I get to when I'm presented with current facts and NBA history the past few years."
lakers,3dljsk,WOX_69,0,Fri Jul 17 14:03:45 2015 UTC,"I know Ty Lawson is probably a bad influence off the court, but I really like his game on the court and he can really help out our young guys, especially Russel. I feel like Russel needs a veteran pg like Lawson to show him the ropes. I really hope we get him. Mitch, please."
lakers,3dljsk,firestulantz,2,Fri Jul 17 09:34:53 2015 UTC,"Lawson should not be showing any young players the ropes.  I'm all for second- and third- chances even, but that's not the right situation for him."
lakers,3dljsk,WOX_69,0,Fri Jul 17 18:36:22 2015 UTC,"This is a terrible idea, and not a player to stick into a young team.  If we were totally lacking in point guards, maybe.  But we have Clarkson and Russell!    What's weird--people rip on Nick Young for ruining the team because he's too silly; yet want to trade him for a guy who has multiple DUIs.  Not cool."
lakers,3dljsk,HardToExplain27,0,Fri Jul 17 14:11:46 2015 UTC,please god no
lakers,3dljsk,GeorgeLovesBOSCO,0,Fri Jul 17 14:38:02 2015 UTC,"I'm usually not down with having two point guard lineups, especially off the bench, BUT if we can move Nick then I'm all for it.  The Lakers have historically been good at dealing with players with issues of various types, so I don't think he'd be a continued problem off the court.  That said, that brings up another issue. He makes around twelve million this year and thirteen the next year before he comes off the books. IF we can make a trade that's a lot for a lot of guards on this team. I don't know if we have enough space to bring him on board while trading Nick and potentially one or both of Sacre/Kelly. If he ends up being waived and we bring him aboard then fine, but outside that I don't know how."
lakers,3dljsk,rtrainer30,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:08 2015 UTC,"You find Nick Young's personality to be so offputting that you think he's singlehandedly ruining the Lakers (and post here constantly saying so), but want them to get a guy who has multiple DUIs?  (MORE THAN ONE!)    OK, dude."
lakers,3do0rt,Franklin3000,2,Fri Jul 17 20:53:44 2015 UTC,"If everything else stays the same?  I think he would have, in my mind, separated himself from Magic and Bird.  He would be outright, to me, top five all time and maybe top 3"
lakers,3do0rt,SpaceCowboy170,3,Fri Jul 17 21:06:16 2015 UTC,He isn't top 5 now? Where is he?
lakers,3do0rt,FreshDiamond,2,Fri Jul 17 22:41:38 2015 UTC,"I generally have him anywhere from 3 to 7.  Mj and Kareem are my top 2, and I have Kobe in a group with Magic and Bird.  This group, to me, and Wilt/Russell round out the top seven, it really just depends on where I put them all on a given day, I don't have these five concretely placed.  If he had won another ring early on, to me he'd be a notch higher than Magic and Bird, putting him definitively in the top five.  It really just depends.  I then have Duncan, Shaq, Lebron, Hakeem and Oscar to finish my 12."
lakers,3do0rt,SpaceCowboy170,0,Fri Jul 17 23:18:59 2015 UTC,Just curious how old are you if you don't mind me asking
lakers,3do0rt,FreshDiamond,2,Fri Jul 17 23:22:24 2015 UTC,"I'm only twenty, so I've only been watching since about 2000.  I try not to be one of those college-age ""I've not seen x play so y is better"" r/NBA users, but I do have my biases.  I try to read up a lot on NBA history and watch as much as I can in terms of historic play.  Unfortunately the NBA doesn't make film super available of guys like Bob Pettit or Neil Johnston, for example.  But yeah, my opinions are limited to my knowledge, so take all of my opinions with a grain of salt"
lakers,3do0rt,SpaceCowboy170,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:30:27 2015 UTC,If your not opposed to illegal downloads you should check torrent sites I have found a lot of great games going back to the early 80s haven't really looked much further but if you interested in studying the history of the game it's a handy tool.

lakers,3dk18t,hobojarpen,11,Thu Jul 16 22:08:05 2015 UTC,"The way that Clarkson works the pick-and-roll also mitigates risk. Clarkson is, at this point, more of a scorer than distributor. He immediately gauges the defense for potential lanes to the rim, though most often Clarkson will settle comfortably into a jumper just a few steps inside the screen. Few drives are forced. Few daring passes are attempted. Clarkson keeps things simple and functional, and as a result turns the ball over just 1.1% of the time while running the pick-and-roll in this space.  The beauty of Clarkson's game is that he can essentially access these kinds of midrange attempts whenever he wants. Beyond the now-standard concessions of the defense, Clarkson—who is listed at 6'5""—stands three to four inches taller than his average positional counterpart. A pull-up jumper is available to him even as his defender scrambles back into the play, whether via step-back or a quick trigger before the opponent can react."
lakers,3dk18t,GoingBackToMyWays,6,Thu Jul 16 22:08:29 2015 UTC,"The great thing about this is the same is true for Russell. Once he settles in, he is very good at that free throw line extended jumper.  The defense will have their hands full with the lakers pick and roll."
lakers,3dk18t,rtrainer30,2,Fri Jul 17 03:34:09 2015 UTC,Except Russell cant get to the rim like Clarkson which changes the way they will guard him.

lakers,3dk18t,TuneHD,3,Fri Jul 17 03:55:17 2015 UTC,"A pass-first combo guard, a scoring combo guard, and an aggressive, tough PF is good. I really hope Hibbert works out since he can be just what we need. After that all we need is either A Brown to become the next Ariza or we need to find a great 3&D guy through trade/FA and our core is set."
lakers,3dk18t,Titanosaurus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:33:36 2015 UTC,"Hibbert can really be a poor man's Deandre Jordan. He can cleanup on the offensive glass, and be a rim protector. Our lineup is built around 1 - 4 for offense and a reliable 5 anchoring the defense and glass."
lakers,3dk18t,Renzokuken4,2,Fri Jul 17 11:31:06 2015 UTC,Makes you wonder how high Kobe's fg percentage would be if he shot mid range shots off of PnR rather than iso.

lakers,3dk18t,hollyw00dhustle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:16:00 2015 UTC,"I never really understood the ""Anti-Mid Range"" movement from the analytic guys. Some of the games best players ever(Michael Jordan, Kobe, Dirk, Durant) have built their career on mid-range jumpers."
lakers,3dk18t,YHWHandSon,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:20:23 2015 UTC,"Because it is more efficient to shoot threes and close range shots. Also, spreading the floor with long range increases offensive effectiveness. While it's true that many great players have been masters of the midrange game, it's important to remember that the average player cannot do what Kobe or MJ can do"
lakers,3dk18t,GOATLin,-9,Fri Jul 17 19:21:43 2015 UTC,"Byron Scott just came. More mid range shots. Fans won't like it when the losses pile up. Clarkson is a perfect guy to take it strong to the hoop or hit a three. Instead, more talent wasted by our incompetent coaching and management."

lakers,3diizl,jomelle,10,Thu Jul 16 16:35:18 2015 UTC,True true. But Upshaw does have decent footwork for his size. Can't wait for him to get in shape! We really got a steal for under $1 mil / year.

lakers,3diizl,kobe_bryant24,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:02:45 2015 UTC,At first glance it looked like he changed his pivot foot but it makes sense to take a step and go for the shot.

lakers,3dnbl6,morericelong,22,Fri Jul 17 17:45:10 2015 UTC,My honest opinion is that we have way too many threads about D'Lo going on right now.
lakers,3dnbl6,ape_cage,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:53:40 2015 UTC,I'm new to /r/Lakers so I apologize if this is topic's been done to death.  But what else is there to talk about?
lakers,3dnbl6,throwawayfashizzle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:54:22 2015 UTC,"Our perimeter defense, post game, offensive sets for starters"
lakers,3dnbl6,badguymatt,10,Sat Jul 18 06:20:02 2015 UTC,"My honest opinion is that you guys need to relax. It's a good thing D'Angelo doesn't scroll through /r/Lakers or /r/NBA because the negativity is only reactionary and super uncalled for.   His biggest issue is that he's forcing his game. & he agreed with that. He said he's being way too risky at times and forcing it, that being said, he went on to see that the passing windows don't close down any quicker in the NBA than they do in the NCAA (from what he's seen thus far), so we've got no reason to worry about his distribution and vision.   He's averaging the roughly the same amount of turnovers per Summer League game as Emmanuel Mudiay, a guy the Denver Nuggets are still stroking their dicks over. And you know why? Because they aren't close-minded. They realize that typically, rookies don't make anywhere close to the impact they'd like in their first year.   This year will be all about translating D'Angelo & Julius' games to the NBA while building chemistry between our young core and the remaining pieces on our team. We're not in win-now mode, and forcing the team into such mode will kill all confidence D'Angelo starts to build throughout the season.   He struggled at the beginning of the college season, you could truly tell the difference when he became more comfortable. At least give him a 1-yr break. If he's showing absolutely no potential whatsoever (99.9% unlikely) then we can hate. Until then, D'Lo all the way."
lakers,3dnbl6,swaggymeeks,2,Fri Jul 17 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"finally, someone who's not trying to trade away our entire roster after 3 SL games lol. i would honestly give our young core like you said a good one year grace period. let me just see that they're getting it and showing signs and flashes"
lakers,3dnbl6,neelium,6,Fri Jul 17 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"First off, I think people generally need to chill out about D'Lo. It's impossible to draw conclusions this early, and yet we get countless threads (followed by countless people saying exactly what I'm saying).  That said, here's what I think. I think he's a really good player, and I think people who are worried are getting hung up on the wrong stuff. What made him such an appealing prospect was his vision and feel for the game. He's put that on display at times, but at other times, he's seemed a little hesitant or a split second slow to react. THIS IS NORMAL. As he adapts, his skills and willingness to pass the ball are going to be a huge asset.  Speed-wise, no he's not blazing quick, but watch him go left and you can see that he's plenty capable of turning the corner. He just needs to work on that off hand so he's a threat going both ways. Not only does that open up more options, but it keeps the defense honest, which gives him an extra edge.  As a shooter, I think he's got range out to the NBA 3, he just needs to recalibrate his shot. I really like his ability to get to the elbow and shoot off the dribble. That'll open up options again, because now coming off a screen, you have to respect that he'll take and make the jumper yet just as easily beat you with a pass to the backdoor cutter.  Defense/Rebounding-wise, long, long long. That wingspan is very evident, and helps make up for deficiencies in lateral quickness. Also helps him rebound very well for his position. I'm not expecting him to be an elite defender, but I think above-average is a totally reasonable expectation.  In short, my opinion on him really hasn't changed at all. Which is no surprise, since he's played all of four summer league games in his NBA career. As fans, we should still be very excited about what he brings to the table, and I for one am looking forward to his development, especially if he gets to work with Nash as has been rumored."
lakers,3dnbl6,Brait002,0,Fri Jul 17 18:02:57 2015 UTC,I like the point about the shot. We have seen he can shoot at an elite level. For some reason his mechanics have been weird in SL. I feel like he's feet are spread out when he should. He needs to square up more and he will start to elevate. You can see most of his shots are short for this reason. This is an easy fix.  Not worried
lakers,3dnbl6,TheWizard77,4,Fri Jul 17 18:10:16 2015 UTC,"He'll be a great player. He has all the tools to be a great-tier 1 point guard. People who freak out over a few summer league games don't know shit about basketball development. Kobe wasn't MJ out of the gate. MJ took time to develop too. The spot light is maddening on this team because of how desperate our fan base looks at trying to be relevant asap.  Lakers fans expect to be contenders over night and Russell to be MVP before playing a single regular season game. Unless you got a crystal ball, take your hate paranoia out of here. We're being smart and building a good team for the future.  With that said, here's the positives you can see in his game.  Excellent passing obviously. This will translate well in the pros when he's surrounded by talent. He can be a shooting threat. His percentages have been down but he has shown a clear ability to get off a quality shot with his quickness and dribbling. I'd like him to get a few more open spot up shots when he isn't handling the ball as opposed to contested dribble then pull up shots.  Rebounding is a huge plus. He's very good at recognizing where to be and getting himself down low to take advantage of that long wingspan. A good attitude towards rebounding wins you games. (Think Kobe game 7 vs celtics).  Ability to finish is definitely there. He had some struggles but he also had a lot of flashes when he converted some difficult lay ups. He'll get better at this throughout his development. He can make free throws. It's a requirement to be a good point guard. It's Rondos biggest weakness. His defense has looked pretty good so far. He doesn't have to be Tony Allen but he has to at least be able to slow down the PGs to some degree. He can take advantage of that wingspan and he's shown a good ability to snake around pick and rolls.  I see all the versatility that's needed to be a good guard in this league. He'll develop. I expect him to be more of a jack of all trades, master at passing. At best he'll be a Curry with the shooting and passing flip flopped. Either way he's going to be a very solid piece we'll have for quite sometime. Be happy Lakers nation. We are an up and coming team that will be attractive to free agents soon enough."
lakers,3dnbl6,sayheykid24,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:00 2015 UTC,"He has the type of court vision that can't be taught, but he needs to adjust to the speed of the NBA like all rookies. People should really stop making sweeping judgements about players based off a few summer league games. It's retarded."
lakers,3dnbl6,lolxddavid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:28:51 2015 UTC,"He has the type of court vision that can't be taught   He's definitely a pass first guard who keeps his eyes up, but I don't know if I can say anything more about his court vision.  I've watched all the summer league games and he has made solid assists, but none that I would do a double take and wonder how he even saw that opportunity. Standard fast break feeds, and pick-and-roll plays."
lakers,3dnbl6,Liquorpuki,0,Fri Jul 17 19:09:16 2015 UTC,"He's doing pretty bad right now but showed some of his potential (passing, shooting, rebounding)"
lakers,3dnbl6,ohhlookathat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:10:14 2015 UTC,He's gonna be fine.  He looks nowhere near as bad as Trey Burke did playing in SL 2 years ago.  He's deadly in transition and with the pocket pass off the pnr.  His court vision is already NBA level and he always seems to know where the open man is.  He needs to get used to the NBA pace but part of the problem is we're still running this crappy Princeton offense half the time.  Most of his SL highlights were playmaking/scoring off the high pnr or launching football passes in transition.
lakers,3dnbl6,megavino,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:01:51 2015 UTC,"He has great awareness of where everyone is on the court. He also tries to exploit defensive holes that seem very logical to exploit yet for whatever reason lots of point guards don't exploit. That's why when a lot of his teammates say they're not expecting the pass or weren't ready for it, he's doing these things. His shooting is also pretty good."
lakers,3dnbl6,PaulKr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"It's summer league and he's shown flashes of brilliance. By the end of this season, no laker fan will be complaining."
lakers,3dnbl6,FreshDiamond,0,Fri Jul 17 19:09:42 2015 UTC,"Not in shape physically and mentally. Locked up in this fucked up prison offense. Has everything to become a 6'5 Steve Nash with a better pull up game, better defense, better rebounding."
lakers,3dnbl6,PaulKr,2,Fri Jul 17 18:10:28 2015 UTC,Better pull up game than Nash? Stop it that's the most homer non sense I have ever read.
lakers,3dnbl6,FreshDiamond,-1,Fri Jul 17 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"He's longer, has a higher release, should be better in isolations creating space. Can't see why not."
lakers,3dnbl6,PaperDesk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:11:07 2015 UTC,It's all well and good and theory but he isn't. Steve Nash was not a spot up shooter. Steve Nash got his own shots and was one of the greatest shooters of all time. You know how guys will train until they make a hundred thousand or billion shots whatever it may be. Steve Nash used to do that but he didn't settle for making them. He had to make them clean nothing but net. I have even heard of him practicing with the criteria that he doesn't even touch the net.
lakers,3dk2e5,oneone26,14,Thu Jul 16 22:17:10 2015 UTC,I was so mad when he went to Dallas...I always hope whoever LO is he knows LAKERS NATION will always have his back! #7
lakers,3dk2e5,KingsCrossings,10,Thu Jul 16 23:07:08 2015 UTC,I miss LO so much.  One of the few guys who has played the game that could do anything on the floor if the team needed it.  Need a primary ballhandler? Not a problem.  Need to clean up the boards? LO's got it. Need someone to take over the scoring load? He could do that too.
lakers,3dk2e5,tangential_quip,6,Thu Jul 16 23:47:12 2015 UTC,This is so true.  He could play all 5 positions.  He's also a guy where the stats really don't tell the whole story of how much he could impact a game.  One of the better defenders on Dirk for instance.
lakers,3dk2e5,sharkytowers76,8,Fri Jul 17 00:35:49 2015 UTC,"I remember watching that game in Cleveland in 2009 at work. We had just beat Boston in overtime a few days earlier, had lost Bynum to a new injury at the beginning of the six game road trip in Memphis (Kobe went nuts in MSG the night after).  I'm convinced Kobe caught the flu from Garnett because he had had it about a week earlier and several other players in the league caught it. Cleveland was undefeated at home. With Kobe sick I didn't know how we'd match if Cleveland caught fire from three like they usually do. But LO. Man, LO. That was pure magic he performed that game. Rebounding on both ends, scoring, assisting, defending, making clutch plays, it was a beautiful overall performance. The grit he showed the game, along with him bullying KG in the game in Boston were his stand out moments from that season outside the playoffs. Just truly wonderful stuff.  When we won in 09, LO was one of the players I was most happy for. And to be honest, when we initially had traded for Chris Paul, I wasn't happy because I wanted to continue having Pau and LO there with Kobe. When it was reneged, I was upset because of the fuckery of it all, but was happy to have them back. When we traded LO after that, man, that hurt. I miss that dude every day.   I'm just happy the organization and his former teammates have been there for him through all this. I hope that he gets back right with everything. I'd love to see him with this organization again in some capacity."
lakers,3dk2e5,WOX_69,4,Fri Jul 17 02:01:38 2015 UTC,"That entire 09' season was magical. They did incredible shit on a nightly basis and beat every team that mattered. Kobe dominating, prime Pau on the block, Ariza doing Ariza things. Lamar Odom, of course. Bynum was still a goofy kid with a ton of talent, even though he got hurt. Bench Mob... Farmar, Vujacic, Luke and his BBQIQ, lol. Shannon Brown with the random threes and firework dunks and even the occasional DJ Mbenga sighting.   Good times."
lakers,3dk2e5,Edmuresay,0,Fri Jul 17 02:41:20 2015 UTC,"Still one of my all time favorite Laker seasons and I believe that team is severely overrated overall in the grand list of champions. We started out the season with so many twenty point blowouts it was unbelievable. The SOS modeled defense scheme was used was just great, I wish there were more video detailing it. We went a way from it a bit later on in the year but the basis of it was still there. Damn I loved that team."

lakers,3dk2e5,hobojarpen,8,Thu Jul 16 23:38:20 2015 UTC,"I like ""playmaking 4"" as a descriptor for LO.  To me, he's right up there with Horry as far as Lakers legends that won't have their jersey retired but were invaluable players."
lakers,3dk2e5,sharkytowers76,3,Fri Jul 17 00:27:39 2015 UTC,Fucking love Odom. Randle reminds me a lot of him when he dribbles the ball down the court
lakers,3dk2e5,ficklefart,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:01:12 2015 UTC,I really want the Lakers to reach out to lamar and let him help Randee with his game since they are similar is many ways.   This will also show Laker family still cares for him maybe help him in this hard time for him
lakers,3dk2e5,shortalbert,2,Fri Jul 17 04:34:30 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking that about Randle too. Randle's a bit more explosive and Odom had better ball handling and passing skills, but if Randle can improve in those areas I can see him becoming a more athletic Lamar."
lakers,3dk2e5,BABYPUBESS,2,Fri Jul 17 13:41:41 2015 UTC,"Odom was great, anyone know how he's doing recently? Heard he's been clean but that's about all I know."
lakers,3dk2e5,OnlyinVegas,3,Fri Jul 17 00:14:28 2015 UTC,I have to think things are pretty rough for him right now.  In June two of his closest friends died a week apart.
lakers,3dk2e5,tangential_quip,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:51:27 2015 UTC,Dude. This guy can't escape death. It's Fucking awful. He probably feels cursed. Wish Lakers would reach out and offer him an assistant coaching job. He helped you. Now help him.

The key is tempered expectations, history tells us that nothing is a guarantee. So what if Russell was No 2 pick? It doesn't mean he'll be great. But also, a couple of bad games at summer league doesn't mean he'll be terrible.  We'll just have to wait and see.  As for Randle, I think the real battle is going on in his mind. He'll be terrified of getting another injury, hence constantly favoring his stronger side and faking right every time. Summer League is the perfect place for him to get this out of his system and learn to trust his body to recover and get even stronger than before. The coaching staff will help him through this process. better he does this now than in pre-seaon or even in regular season."

lakers,3djebz,jonnysh,7,Thu Jul 16 19:47:19 2015 UTC,Lakers girls is a extremely high profile job in dance career field and looks really good on these ladies resumes. Lakers were the first to have cheerleaders in the nba and some pretty famous people like Paula Abdul got their  start as a laker girl. Lakers girls matter and are a big deal. Plus they get a women demographic watching the Lakers girls stuff is great for ratings I'd imagine. Correct if im wrong but I think it's a non pay job too.

The Lakers have a channel dedicated to them, so the idea of filling time slots with Laker girls stuff isn't all that crazy. Especially when you consider the channel is watched predominately by men. This isn't just a Laker girls thing, many other teams do the same thing. It's also not like they are getting paid minimum wage, no one forces them to be apart of any of it."

I'm not trying to make a moral argument against having cheerleaders, It doesn't matter to me one way or the other. I just think it's unfortunate that we have a whole segment of fans who could care less about what the Lakers do on the court (Laker Girls fans), or that people can view a Lakers Girl Audition as equally valid content as even Summer League game play.   I come here to talk Lakers Basketball, not to watch people duke it out to be cheerleaders for my favorite team."

lakers,3dhwhb,ChapulinDescalzonado,15,Thu Jul 16 16:33:36 2015 UTC,Because we've always been a high profile and at times flashy team within the general vicinity of Hollywood.  I work in Hollywood and can get to Staples in 8 or less minutes without traffic.

It is literally that close.  With no traffic 8 minutes is very doable. I also drive... swiftly when traffic permits.  I guess if it makes you happier, I'll give you 10 minutes with no traffic. It's about 6 miles away so if I go a solid 80 or so on the freeway the entire time that's pretty easy."
lakers,3dhwhb,Sletts,5,Thu Jul 16 17:32:38 2015 UTC,The Lakers have been associated with Hollywood since the Showtime era when movie/tv celebs would be frequently spotted in attendance. The tradition holds to this day. You'll almost never see a nationally televised Laker game without having one little segment showing all the celebs at the game.

I DO hate how the current jerseys shoulder portions are so wide in between the neckline and armhole trim. I hope that changes once Nike takes over in '17"
lakers,3dljmz,GoldenStrike,2,Fri Jul 17 07:18:39 2015 UTC,Let's be honest - the design before the 2000 update was much more iconic in my opinion. I also agree with you about the wide shoulder portions - as well as the t-bone on the front (very 2000). It could use a refresh.

You can just tell the guy is a workhorse. He doesn't just talk about improving he actually goes out and does it. Also, he's got somewhat elite athleticism so his ceiling is up there. Also, in 5 years he'll be in his athletic prime.  Wasn't really sure where to put Upshaw. I honestly think he could be one of the top centers in the league if he puts the work in but the jury is still out on his work ethic so I'll keep him behind randle. But seriously, upshaws ceiling is sky high. I hope he seized this opportunity cause we could have a really fun team down the road if those top 4 stay in LA for a few years"

lakers,3dki63,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Fri Jul 17 02:22:56 2015 UTC,"Alright here we go:  Russell- Absolutely believe he will be or will be on the verge of becoming a star at this time.  Clarkson- Him and Russell will go hand in hand and will be teammates still hopefully. The 1+2 punch. The Beal for Wall. The Klay for Curry. Just think D'LO is a bit more talented overall. Will probably be the better scorer. Both of these players will be all-stars at some point.  Randle- Our new Lamar Odom. Gonna be feasting in the paint and will probably have a semi-reliable mid-range by then. Tunnel vision will go away and he'll be a more willing passer. Will never be an all-star, but will be absolutely solid for the 3rd star on the team.  Black- Considering how small ball is becoming a huge thing in this league, I certainly see him becoming a capable ""big"". Fast, good rebounder, hustler, improving both his scoring and defense (neither of which were necessarily bad to begin with). He came into the league at the perfect time to be an undersized center.  Nance- Something about this kid, man. See him as more of a journeyman for teams who needs his hustle. Don't think he'll ever be much of a scorer (though I think he'll be capable if need be), but he will be a very capable (if not great) defender. Fast and long enough to keep up with 3s, 4s, and some 5s. None of his stats will every be eye-popping, but he's going to stay on a roster as long as he's willing to do all of the dirty work. The Swiss army knife every team needs.  Jabari Brown- Here's where we start getting below ""good"". Will be the prototypical journeyman shooter/chucker. Very hot and cold. Undersized for his position but works hard enough to make up from it. Probably a bit above mediocre that teams will be happy to have on the bench for them.  Kelly- Still have hopes for this kid, but let's be real. Slow, lumbering PF who can stretch the floor. High IQ but doesn't have many of the physical tools needed to utilize it. Good size, but won't play much defense. Mediocre through and through. Might be a decent passer and will at least force bigs out of the paint with his shooting ability. He'll stick around in the league.  Anthony Brown- Nothing about him sticks out to me. Haven't seen much so it's too early to tell, but seems like the SF who's on a new roster every season. I think his ceiling is a Wes Johnson without the athleticism but with the better jumper. Could very well be the player that's out of the league before anyone else.  Sacre- Just isn't really good at anything at all. Mediocre at best with some things. Won't say terrible, but he doesn't rebound, soft touch and okay jumper but isn't consistent with either, not much of a defender...he won't be out of the league, though. Still better than most deep bench centers. He's still a 7-footer. Will fill a roster spot and give it his all when he needs to."

Hes for sure got crazy court vision but I'm not sure how much you can say about his intelligence. One of the main reasons I don't see him as highly intelligent is because of his interviews. He's been saying the same buzz words over and over in every interview since the draft. Its as if someone gave him a script and he has no real insight of his own. I find some of his longer interviews really hard to watch because he says the same stuff over and over again.   Maybe I'm being to hard on the kid. I realize it could just be the fact that he is 19 and nervous. But I really am curious as to why everyone says he's so intelligent   EDIT: Im not talking about this segment here.

I guarantee you'll regret it though haha.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl_WkTiH6-Q  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiMLtKIq0yA  All you need to know about the second vid is that Bryan McKnight is balling it up and Kobe's rapping. If that's not ludicrous I don't know what is.

lakers,3dh6ff,Cienes,19,Thu Jul 16 06:15:56 2015 UTC,"I really wish Summer League was a few games longer. Just 3 or 4. I feel like the Lakers were actually developing something on the court in the game against the Mavs, it's a shame we'll only see it one more time."
lakers,3dh6ff,PatronSaintOfUpdog,3,Thu Jul 16 06:56:35 2015 UTC,"Ya it was a decent game. Especially cause it was close and we got to see our new talent handle a little pressure. Wish every one would stfu about D-Rus though. He's a rookie, its summer league, fucking relax. And if ur still not sure. Watch Kobe take last second shots and get air ball his first couple years. But ya. More games would definitely benefit us. But I hope now there could full team practices so we can get the ball rolling on this gravy train. I'm excited for this season. Not really expecting much. Maybe 8th seed at best but I just wanna see Lakers not play shitty any more. That's all I ask. Definitely can't wait to see them at Staples too."
lakers,3dh6ff,mrnailed,8,Thu Jul 16 18:21:45 2015 UTC,And along with increased SL viewership comes an avalanche of overreactions...
lakers,3dh6ff,ape_cage,3,Thu Jul 16 15:54:35 2015 UTC,Hopefully they'll still want to watch next year after the past few games..
lakers,3dh6ff,yunguno,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:20:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I agree with the conclusion. Watching doesn't mean fans are buying in necessarily, it just means that fans are keenly aware that the organization is buying in to the youth movement so our future hinges on their performances. Any dedicated fan would do so, even if they thought they should trade some youth for Boogie."

lakers,3dgecd,p321p,6,Thu Jul 16 02:43:36 2015 UTC,yea I thought he was fair. When dlo was making plays he gave him some dap. I think people are just sensitive

He was complimentary to randle, upshaw and jabari though."
lakers,3dgecd,harleq01,7,Thu Jul 16 14:16:23 2015 UTC,That dude was intolerable. That and the stupid fouls made the game frustrating

lakers,3dgecd,GeraltsBeard,2,Thu Jul 16 03:33:56 2015 UTC,"This speaks more to your average NBA analyst/FO confusing ""athleticism"" with ""fitness.""  Fat Marc Gasol was athletic despite his fitness.  Thin Marc Gasol's athleticism shines brighter now that he's increased his fitness.  The problem is especially bad right now because the misuse of the term is a relatively new phenomenon.  This means that, when people describe someone as athletic, the person hearing it actually imagines true athletic talent in their mind.  When we start imagining muscles as talent, everything gets turned upside down. Our greatest athletes use coordination and agility to achieve greatness.  Fitness just kicks those characteristics up another notch, but right now, it's taking center stage when folks are evaluating draft talent."
lakers,3dgecd,myLeftTesticleofFury,2,Thu Jul 16 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"Ya. That's why he does summer games. Who cares. What he said is bullshit. Thus, does not matter. Therefore he does not matter. Got more important shit to worry about than what a ""nobody"" said."
lakers,3dgecd,mrnailed,3,Thu Jul 16 18:24:23 2015 UTC,Didn't he say the Lakers should draft Russell with #2 pick before the draft. I mean I don't see anything wrong with stating the flaws of D'Los game when there's clearly a lot of room for improvement.   Edit: he did say we should draft russell instead of okafor

lakers,3dgzfl,mralln,2,Thu Jul 16 17:28:40 2015 UTC,i'm going to be real with you guys I dont feel as strongly about randle as the rest of you for the following reasons  -horrible defense  -for some reason he wants to be a guard so he keeps hanging out at the 3 point line  -that charging into the lane stuff he does will get him offensive fouls in the future  -he doesn't seem to be able to play on the block like real PF
lakers,3dgzfl,kemar7856,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:58:03 2015 UTC,"Good points, but rookies don't dominate because they have flaws in their game. Those are his weaknesses as of today. I think that with time and coaching:   -for some reason he wants to be a guard so he keeps hanging out at the 3 point line  -that charging into the lane stuff he does will get him offensive fouls in the future  -he doesn't seem to be able to play on the block like real PF  can all be worked on and fixed. He may not become an elite defender but he's strong and he can get better."
lakers,3dgzfl,trilla517,0,Thu Jul 16 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldnt call his defense horrible, he does pretty well on switches"

lakers,3dh85q,CalcBros,2,Thu Jul 16 11:03:22 2015 UTC,"This puts my reaction to the current roster into perspective.  I remember thinking that Mihm would be a big body in the middle to protect the rim and do some screen and roll, if needed (granted, I never really saw him play before that season).  I thought Vlade would be a good veteran presence.  I remember thinking Lamar was an all-star caliber player.  I don't remember what I thought of Caron, at the time, who ended up being our second best player.  Kobe was Kobe.  I was pretty sure this team would still make the playoffs and do some damage.  Little did I know that Kobe actually would take a roster like this to the playoffs twice and almost advance past the suns (damn you Thomas!).  Puts into perspective the expectations I have now...I need to keep myself in check. Let's all wait until the new year to see what we got this year."

lakers,3dgwlu,oneone26,8,Thu Jul 16 04:27:59 2015 UTC,I'm a bit concerned that Russell couldn't get by Pangos.
lakers,3dgwlu,j33sizzle,7,Thu Jul 16 06:06:15 2015 UTC,I don't think he can get pass most defenders. He doesn't have the handles or the speed. He also doesn't have the NBA three at the moment. What I see him do really well is use good screens and then utilize his body to create some separation.
lakers,3dgwlu,CalmerThanYouAreDood,2,Thu Jul 16 06:11:10 2015 UTC,"Also he's 6'5"" with a 6'10"" wingspan. Hopefully he can pick a a bit from Kobe on how to go to work in the mid post."
lakers,3dgwlu,virji24,2,Thu Jul 16 19:50:58 2015 UTC,He just needs time in the gym and the shot will come back to him
lakers,3dgwlu,USCTrojanMJB,-9,Thu Jul 16 13:50:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely not the best way to fulfill expectations as a franchise changer."
lakers,3dgwlu,oOoleveloOo,5,Thu Jul 16 06:46:20 2015 UTC,Players can still beat their defenders without using speed. James Harden doesn't have the pure athleticism to get by people either. He does it with all the dribble and hesitation moves. Steve Nash is another guy who fits the above criteria.
lakers,3dgwlu,TheAsianMamba,14,Thu Jul 16 15:01:30 2015 UTC,Why doesn't anyone know how to spell Russell? Seriously everyone I see that mentions him leaves out an l.
lakers,3dgwlu,FuriousFlex,6,Thu Jul 16 05:16:27 2015 UTC,The kid is special. He needs time to develop. Those passes were magic Nash level. I just hope Nash trains russel a few times gives him some pointers.
lakers,3dgwlu,dashan987,3,Thu Jul 16 11:16:07 2015 UTC,*Russell
lakers,3dgwlu,Notalent13,3,Thu Jul 16 04:39:45 2015 UTC,"His shot has seemed a bit off so far, and yeah, hes not blowing anyone away with his athleticism but damn some of those passes...even in the previous games his passes were amazing. At the very least, hes shown he can be a Ricky Rubio or Rajon Rondo type player."
lakers,3dgwlu,lars5,4,Thu Jul 16 04:43:37 2015 UTC,i'm not too concerned with the athleticism. he's very good at using his body to keep separation between the ball and the defender. couple of workouts with some vets to hone that skill and he shouldn't have any problems.
lakers,3dgwlu,DJQuik,2,Thu Jul 16 05:46:23 2015 UTC,he needs to work on his handles. tony parker isn't very athletic and neither was nash.  both had epic jumpers and d'angelo can develop one. handles + jumper nullifies lack of athleticism.
lakers,3dgwlu,lars5,5,Thu Jul 16 09:31:34 2015 UTC,"his elbow jumper has been money so far, and he seems to get to that spot with ease. i think people are just expecting him to put up numbers, but he's out there trying to run the system."
lakers,3dgwlu,DJQuik,2,Thu Jul 16 18:01:49 2015 UTC,"exactly. put this dude in an open court offense and he's load up that stat sheet. He's playing according to our system, and frankly it's not very good at generating open or high percentage looks"
lakers,3dgwlu,Akvc8,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:35:45 2015 UTC,Tony Parker in his prime was one of the quickest players in the league. Dude's midrange game was nasty.
lakers,3dgwlu,DJQuik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:53:03 2015 UTC,"I know this, and TP was one of the best for several years.  I don't see why DR can't improve his ball handles/off-hand, work on his jumper and put it all together to be a great PG that's not athletic."
lakers,3dgwlu,xCoM24,-2,Thu Jul 16 21:33:08 2015 UTC,Parker and Nash were some of the quickest players in the league... something Russell is not.
lakers,3dgwlu,dexter_mcclusterfuck,2,Thu Jul 16 14:08:28 2015 UTC,Good part is he showed a much better shooting stroke in college than either Rubio or Rondo. Both of those players coming into the league were known to have weak shots.
lakers,3dgwlu,PaperDesk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:39:01 2015 UTC,"Well Rondo was a really good defense in his prime and Ricky Rubio is able to get a lot of steals so I think the comparisons aren't quite perfect, but I think they are close. I'm starting to think he's going to be a lot like Jason Williams. He will be able to have flashy passes and will adjust his shot to be useful, but he won't be efficient enough to be lead scorer and won't be able to play good defense. I think Jason Williams is a solid comparison."
lakers,3dgwlu,SedaleThreatt,-1,Fri Jul 17 03:46:02 2015 UTC,"If he can develop as a defender like either of those guys he'll be great.  He has the passing potential, he's taller, more athletic (not by much which isn't saying a lot but still,) and he can actually shoot. Rubio/Rondo with a shot would be a player I'd love to have."

lakers,3dgwlu,Loryk,-2,Thu Jul 16 04:37:35 2015 UTC,One thing that bothers me about Russell is that he seems to miss a ton of free throws.
lakers,3dgjc5,ashishvp,31,Thu Jul 16 02:27:18 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Lakerfam, there is still one more game. All summer league teams get 5 games. Even if they go 0-5. At this point we just wanna see a good statline from Randle and Russell.  I'm confident Byron will straighten them out before or during preseason. If Byron is good at anything, it's rookies"
lakers,3dgjc5,zunick,3,Thu Jul 16 02:29:56 2015 UTC,We can still advance in the tournament?
lakers,3dgjc5,c_double_u,15,Thu Jul 16 02:44:11 2015 UTC,"nah, it's a consolation game"
lakers,3dgjc5,zunick,6,Thu Jul 16 02:47:10 2015 UTC,:( Really didn't want to wait till October for more basketball.
lakers,3dgjc5,UltraFlyingTurtle,3,Thu Jul 16 02:56:15 2015 UTC,Doesn't preseason start in September?
lakers,3dgjc5,LukeWalton4MVP,7,Thu Jul 16 03:01:26 2015 UTC,Look at the top of page. It has the dates for the first several preseason games. First one is Oct. 4th.

lakers,3dgjc5,StarlingRover,31,Thu Jul 16 02:47:56 2015 UTC,wtf was that last play?
lakers,3dgjc5,CalmerThanYouAreDood,33,Thu Jul 16 02:27:42 2015 UTC,"That was all on Mad Dog.   Having fucking RANDLE run over for the inbound with 1.4 seconds. I guess that's why they call him ""Mad"""
lakers,3dgjc5,misterrunon,25,Thu Jul 16 02:28:22 2015 UTC,And having Russell inbound the ball was pretty stupid too.
lakers,3dgjc5,helpChars,5,Thu Jul 16 02:31:16 2015 UTC,"Yea, I thought they were gonna try a throw back to the inbounder type play."
lakers,3dgjc5,lars5,20,Thu Jul 16 02:34:18 2015 UTC,Wasn't nearly enough time. I was optimistic about Madsen coming into the SL and I thought he might be groomed to be the next coach. But I think it's clear after these 4 games he has no business being a head coach in the NBA.
lakers,3dgjc5,Amazing-Spider-Man,6,Thu Jul 16 02:37:28 2015 UTC,Mad dog coaching skillz.
lakers,3dgjc5,AllGoldEverything,3,Thu Jul 16 02:28:34 2015 UTC,"Forcing the rookie to get some crunch time experience instead of deferring to Clarkson who may have made a smarter pass. Having said that, that shouldn't have gone to Randle and he should know better than to dribble with that little time left on the clock. At least these games don't count."
lakers,3dgjc5,OnlyinVegas,4,Thu Jul 16 02:29:51 2015 UTC,"mavs probably broke up the play that was called, and tyler's length kept russell from throwing a pass toward the basket. I would have had Randle inbound the ball. Defenses will always put a PF or C on the inbounder at the end of games to force the ball away from the basket."
lakers,3dgjc5,PdRLakers,61,Thu Jul 16 02:31:22 2015 UTC,This is the Randle we were hoping for
lakers,3dgjc5,Mr_Chandler_Bing,6,Thu Jul 16 02:28:12 2015 UTC,what happened?? i was too busy playing ball at the rec..
lakers,3dgjc5,StarlingRover,10,Thu Jul 16 04:08:03 2015 UTC,"He killed it! blew by defenders, finished at the rim, and hit some sweet midrange jumpers.  His speed seriously looks elite for PF's"
lakers,3dgjc5,FreshDiamond,4,Thu Jul 16 05:34:16 2015 UTC,"Randle's missing that strong hop to finish at the rim but that'll come.  His timing and patience really stood out, even showed ability to switch gears when attacking instead of just full boar, which was a great sign."
lakers,3dgjc5,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:46:48 2015 UTC,"That step back doeeeeee! Oh man, so sweet!"
lakers,3dgjc5,StarlingRover,16,Thu Jul 16 16:04:41 2015 UTC,"Randle Looked better, Russell is still struggling with his shot but his passing skills are evident in glimpses of what could be. One annoying thing though is that our young bigs aren't getting at it for rebounds. I don't know if it's them lacking effort or that it's just summer league, but it helped the mavs win this game."
lakers,3dgjc5,FreshDiamond,5,Thu Jul 16 02:33:04 2015 UTC,Russ is making a lot of bad passes still. He is late on a lot but he showed some glimpses of what every one is talking about. That bounce when he goes up to shoot. OH MA GAWD.
lakers,3dgjc5,thehumangenius23,26,Thu Jul 16 03:35:32 2015 UTC,"Randle needs to work on that off-hand. His display of range is making me optimistic. But also his defense is fucking abysmal, the same people shitting on Boozer will probably be making excuses for Randle."
lakers,3dgjc5,hooperextraordinaire,5,Thu Jul 16 02:29:26 2015 UTC,"Yea he looks disinterested on that side of the ball, he didn't do a good job of boxing out either. I wonder if it that is due to a lack of effort or a lack of conditioning."
lakers,3dgjc5,Buckelroo,5,Thu Jul 16 02:39:25 2015 UTC,Both and size. We had him playing the 5 for an extended period in the second quarter. I hope that is something the real lakers never EVER attempt
lakers,3dgjc5,hooperextraordinaire,2,Thu Jul 16 03:37:19 2015 UTC,lakers have been playing super small ball.
lakers,3dgjc5,BerriesNCreme,18,Thu Jul 16 04:39:56 2015 UTC,If only Tarik Black had made that dunk... He should've taken a dribble before going up
lakers,3dgjc5,ohsemantics,20,Thu Jul 16 02:31:08 2015 UTC,Don't forget Munford missing that fucking freebie.
lakers,3dgjc5,Lightning14,4,Thu Jul 16 02:34:48 2015 UTC,He turned around too like he thought it was definitely going in. lol
lakers,3dgjc5,UpnUpvote,9,Thu Jul 16 02:41:08 2015 UTC,"honestly could've won that game but just could not make the baskets. Miss layup by clarkson, missed wide open shots, dlo coughing it up at the end. Ahh well at least I can do something more productive than watch Summer league games"
lakers,3dgjc5,USCTrojanMJB,16,Thu Jul 16 02:33:47 2015 UTC,"I'm optimistic that Kobe and our veterans will actually convert D'angelo's passes, and that Randle will have more space to operate with a defensive big like Hibbert. Nance and Brown are ready to go and should fit right in. Tarik Black is one of the best backup bigs in the league. Clarkson is on track for an even better sophomore campaign. And, the best part is Mark Madsen won't be coaching anymore.  Anyone disagree?"
lakers,3dgjc5,letsgolakers24,8,Thu Jul 16 02:45:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree with Tarik Black being one of the best backup bigs in the league. He has a bright future, but you're overestimating his current impact. And as for Clarkson, I wouldn't expect him to be better than he was late in the season last year simply because he will have to share the ball with more ball handlers this year with Kobe and Nick healthy and the additions of Russell and Lou."
lakers,3dgjc5,p321p,-4,Thu Jul 16 06:00:22 2015 UTC,"Madsen may not be coaching anymore, but Byron will be and that's just as bad, if not worse."
lakers,3dgjc5,ohsemantics,-4,Thu Jul 16 04:37:57 2015 UTC,"Sunshine pumper in the house! Lmao, Tarik is definitely not one of the best backup bigs in the league. The dude fouls out in the damn locker room!  Russell is going to have an abysmal assist to turnover ratio. He's so ordinary right now it's painful. Mudiay is going to eat his lunch, and people will be mad we passed on him in 2-3 years."
lakers,3dgjc5,Holajuwon34,11,Thu Jul 16 06:54:56 2015 UTC,"I wish we drafted Justin Anderson, he played really well for Dallas today."
lakers,3dgjc5,letsgolakers24,3,Thu Jul 16 02:29:33 2015 UTC,Definitely. Was able to knockdown on some catch and shoot 3's. His block was crucial at the end for Dallas. Rotated back to the rim to stop Black. Got Black to mistime his jump and Anderson took advantage of that.
lakers,3dgjc5,ohsemantics,6,Thu Jul 16 02:33:13 2015 UTC,"You're effectively saying you'd rather have Justin Anderson over both Nance and Anthony Brown and I just disagree with you. In order to move up to get Anderson, we'd probably have to include both the 27th and 34th."
lakers,3dgjc5,myLeftTesticleofFury,8,Thu Jul 16 02:40:39 2015 UTC,I'd swap Anderson for Nance Jr and Brown in a heartbeat.
lakers,3dgjc5,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,13,Thu Jul 16 02:52:15 2015 UTC,Anderson has a higher ceiling than either of those two. Quality > Quantity here
lakers,3dgjc5,Holajuwon34,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:45:37 2015 UTC,"Generally I agree, but I don't think the drop-off in quality is significant and we had a ton of needs. You're not necessarily drafting for talent in the 20s."
lakers,3dgjc5,TIL_Im_Bald,2,Thu Jul 16 02:49:55 2015 UTC,"You're not necessarily drafting for talent in the 20s.   I'm not sure this is relevant for this draft.  Time will tell, but a lot of analysts were calling this a historically deep draft with potential for good talent well into the 20s."
lakers,3dgjc5,GoingBackToMyWays,7,Thu Jul 16 05:49:05 2015 UTC,Over Nance? I dunno I really like Larry Nance.
lakers,3dgjc5,PaperDesk,17,Thu Jul 16 02:30:49 2015 UTC,"Hell yeah over Nance. He's a really solid player who plays at the position we really need and instead of drafting Anthony Brown then we could've pursued other players in the second round like Richaun Holmes or Willy Hernangomez, shit even Nance Jr.  I'm not losing any sleep about it though, Justin Anderson is too good to slip that far down and Anthony Brown was a solid pickup."
lakers,3dgjc5,BuyAllTheVowels,5,Thu Jul 16 02:36:53 2015 UTC,"Dude you can't be serious. Nance's hustle plays are nice, but don't let a couple putback dunks and loose ball dives make you think Larry Nance Jr is anywhere near Justin Anderson's level. I mean, how did Nance do today?"
lakers,3dgjc5,iNteL-_-,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:50:56 2015 UTC,Yea man. His jump shot looks awful. He really needs to work on it if he hopes to have a career. Or somehow make those go in.

lakers,3dgjc5,supermaor23,17,Thu Jul 16 02:31:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah! Now that I think about it, we really should have just drafted LeBron James. I hear he's pretty good."
lakers,3dgjc5,thelakesh0w,4,Thu Jul 16 02:57:22 2015 UTC,"Only a handful of these guys will be on the team...as rookies or second year players. They'll keep developing and might surprise, don't stress over this.   Either guys are trying to impress enough to make the end of an NBA bench or guys with contracts try to develop areas that are not very good right now. I'd rather have the latter on my SL squad. Then there's the rare young fella who broke his leg and hasn't played organized basketball in a year trying to find his game. We got one of those, too.   Wins are nice and I'm sure they played to get the W, but this is glorified pick-up ball (with ticky-tack fouls). Can't wait for training camp!"
lakers,3dgjc5,misterrunon,3,Thu Jul 16 02:54:22 2015 UTC,"I'm actually kinda glad we lost here. I think the guys will be super motivated. Its just Summer League, we as fans get less to see the Lakers and the players get less to play obviously, but I believe the motivation will outweigh that long-term.  Some good signs from Russell and Randle this game."

lakers,3dgjc5,Buckelroo,2,Thu Jul 16 02:35:39 2015 UTC,Ughh clarkson with turn over at the end and Russell with a turnover with 25 sec left
lakers,3dgjc5,helpChars,7,Thu Jul 16 04:24:02 2015 UTC,"The bad: D'Angelo didn't play very well and couldn't throw a pea into the ocean.  The good: Julius played well, and at least it wasn't D'Angelo's worst game of summer league."
lakers,3dgjc5,tragichero24,11,Thu Jul 16 02:29:19 2015 UTC,The Bad: D'Angelo is electing to play one handed. The Worst: Randle's defense.
lakers,3dgjc5,rotharek,6,Thu Jul 16 02:33:20 2015 UTC,"D'angelo would rather dribble into a double team, than use his right hand."
lakers,3dgjc5,GOATLin,18,Thu Jul 16 02:30:15 2015 UTC,"If you're trying to split the D and they're staggered with the further player to your left, you split with your left hand. Unless you were just trying to be humorous then my fault."
lakers,3dgjc5,clippjoint,2,Thu Jul 16 02:32:16 2015 UTC,"There was no need to try to split it though. Anyone else would have dribbled back and let Tarik roll, or spun out of it and use Tarik's back pick."
lakers,3dgjc5,Buckelroo,5,Thu Jul 16 02:41:14 2015 UTC,Of course. We aren't talking about what he should've done though. We're talking about what happened and the mechanics involved.
lakers,3dgjc5,clippjoint,2,Thu Jul 16 03:02:33 2015 UTC,"Why is no one talking about jabari brown? Dude scored almost 20 again on 11 shots. He seems consistent enough to be a bench contributor for the season. Keep in mind that he dropped 4 20 pt games at the end of last season and averaged 20ppg in college (to Clarksons 18ppg both of whom played for Missouri)  Stats aside, he plays very composed and plays within himself. But thats not to say he's one dimensional, he can hit the outside shot or drive it in to get to the free throw line."
lakers,3dgjc5,TheGreatMufasa1,2,Thu Jul 16 06:39:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but realistically, what's his play time going to be? With Swaggy and Lou, he's probably looking at around 15 mins a game."
lakers,3dgjc5,Buckelroo,0,Thu Jul 16 15:38:18 2015 UTC,"So we're playing 3 regular season starters and it's still this bad?  We're gonna win 25 games at most with Byron Scott at the helm running his ""max out Kobe's stats"" offense."

lakers,3dgjc5,SupaZT,3,Thu Jul 16 03:14:13 2015 UTC,Nah there's one more game on Friday. It's like a consolation game. Doesn't mean anything but at least the rookies get some more minutes
lakers,3dgjc5,OoiDaBoi,2,Thu Jul 16 02:31:36 2015 UTC,I wonder if Russell is just rusty or what but he came into the draft with passing and offense as one of his strengths. It's looking like rebounding and passing is his strength now. I don't know if he's rusty since training has started and what not and he had other games to shape up. Randle was looking good today
lakers,3dgjc5,FuriousFlex,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:47:02 2015 UTC,"After watching our pre-draft videos, I was a little worried about his shooting - there were clips of him shooting and he made about half of them. I think his shooting needs adjustment - he uses too much of his upper body and not enough of his legs to get him into rhythym.   Right now, he just doesn't seem to have the NBA range. He's gotta work on strengthening his legs for a little more explosion + lift on his shooting."
lakers,3dh34j,vtechnique,3,Thu Jul 16 05:37:40 2015 UTC,"Russell had some really great passes today, glad to see he's getting a flow of the game along with Randle!"

lakers,3dgpe7,GeraltsBeard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:03:19 2015 UTC,Was it really necessary to point out his bad shooting when the guy was clearly joking?
lakers,3dgpe7,BeefCat10,0,Thu Jul 16 05:20:01 2015 UTC,His shot has looked flat most of the time.  And he seems disinterested in the game most of the time.  It wasn't until about 5min left in the third quarter until I saw him get some pep in his step tonight on D.  That then translated to him getting some good passes and lay ups on O.  Hope he can get that fire to hustle sooner than later.  I think that will help his growing pains.  Still excited about his future on the team.
lakers,3dgpe7,iJIP,2,Thu Jul 16 04:05:01 2015 UTC,His only 3 for the game doesn't count

lakers,3dgpe7,DJQuik,0,Thu Jul 16 07:02:07 2015 UTC,Flashes of the future.
lakers,3dg4bh,jordanthejordna,24,Thu Jul 16 00:22:31 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. This will be a wake up call for Russell and co, fortunately we have a legendary guard on our team who can help with his development, and a coach who coached a young CP3 and Kyrie. He'll be fine as long as he continues to work hard."
lakers,3dg4bh,Holajuwon34,13,Thu Jul 16 00:30:13 2015 UTC,Guarantee Kobe is killing himself to get back to shooting and in shape to go 1v1 With these new young bloods we drafted.
lakers,3dg4bh,FuriousFlex,8,Thu Jul 16 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"yeah, I can't wait for that moment. Remember last year, he played one-on-one versus Randle. Randle said he was up 3-0 and then after that, it was 3-21. Man."
lakers,3dg4bh,GeraltsBeard,2,Thu Jul 16 03:46:08 2015 UTC,That sounds like a sick story. Have a link?
lakers,3dg4bh,ceelogreen5,8,Thu Jul 16 04:59:30 2015 UTC,Here you go: https://youtu.be/BuaWltHoGZU  Bad memory for me though. Julius was up 7-3 then finished 7-21
lakers,3dg4bh,GeraltsBeard,2,Thu Jul 16 05:14:30 2015 UTC,Is that Cory Magette or Neyo on the right next to Marcellus. Can't tell lol.
lakers,3dg4bh,xraigekoux,2,Thu Jul 16 11:54:50 2015 UTC,Finished 7-21 after Kobe apparently fouled him.
lakers,3dg4bh,dre101,5,Thu Jul 16 06:49:22 2015 UTC,"I imagine Kobe's blood literally boiling whenever he sits at home and watch other teams playing in the playoffs, years after he has retired."
lakers,3dg4bh,holyevilcow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:00:38 2015 UTC,couldn't agree more. training camp is gonna be fun.
lakers,3dg4bh,BuyAllTheVowels,9,Thu Jul 16 03:00:58 2015 UTC,I thought he showed some really promising flashes tonight. The fact that he's progressing in his... 4th game ever played at a pseudo-nba level keeps me hopeful.  We have to remember that he's a project full of potential. We passed on the NBA ready player to build for the future and that is what Russell is. I expect him to make a lot of mistakes this year sprinkled with flashes of brilliance and we might not see his full potential for another few years.
lakers,3dg4bh,Sletts,7,Thu Jul 16 02:29:55 2015 UTC,That last inbound play left a sour taste in my mouth
lakers,3dg4bh,javi2123,5,Thu Jul 16 02:22:40 2015 UTC,All of our young guys that make the team will look better instantly when they are surrounded by professionals. Dlo is gonna be really nice once he figures out where individual players like to receive the ball. Clarkson is a step above almost every player in the summer league. Black still look promising. Upshaw was hustling like their coach mad dog use to when he laced them up for the purple and gold. Jabari Brown although limited showed plenty of offensive fire power. Randle looked healthy and was running the ball up the court like Lamar use to. These are all good signs for the lakers
lakers,3dg4bh,CaptainRatTrap,11,Thu Jul 16 03:23:19 2015 UTC,"It's ok that he's struggling now since it's only summer league, but don't kid yourself. No one's glad he's struggling, except Laker haters."
lakers,3dg4bh,CHUN_BUNS,7,Thu Jul 16 00:39:50 2015 UTC,"i wasn't at first, but after thinking about it a bit i really do think it's a good thing to go through something like this to light a fire under your ass."
lakers,3dg4bh,USCTrojanMJB,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:45:15 2015 UTC,"If he didn't already have a fire under his ass, he's doing it wrong."
lakers,3dg4bh,BuyAllTheVowels,2,Thu Jul 16 06:57:44 2015 UTC,"true. i'm sure he already had motivation, but there's nothing wrong with having even more. there's no such thing as too much motivation in professional sports. to a degree i feel like maybe he thought the transition to the professional game would be smoother, but clearly it's a different animal and i think he's understanding that."
lakers,3dg4bh,lufty574,3,Thu Jul 16 23:17:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I hope Russell is texting Kobe right now planning his workouts with the Mamba once he gets back to LA.   How sick would that be? Kobe like, ""Take Uber from the airport here. Vanessa fixed the guest room, you're staying 'til October."""
lakers,3dg4bh,TheJucheisLoose,3,Thu Jul 16 03:02:59 2015 UTC,I would be terrified if I was a young professional and my boss/legend in the field did this.   I'd also significantly increase my chance at being a legend myself if I followed through on it.
lakers,3dg4bh,NotLouisMalle,0,Thu Jul 16 04:30:17 2015 UTC,"it's a good thing, lakerbros.   Sorry, no. I understand you're trying to put a positive spin on things, but this is not a ""good thing."" D'Angelo playing well would be a good thing. This is a thing that may not be as bad as it looks -- but it is in no way a ""good"" thing. Let's not get all Greek politician ""vote against austerity and things will just work out -- it's all good!"" in here.   I, too, think he will improve with practice and time. But it would be a ""good"" thing if he were playing better than he is now, which is not at a high level at all."
lakers,3dg4bh,squidwardsabz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:06:46 2015 UTC,"Russell's going to be a great fucking player. We didn't draft him for summer league, we drafted him because we want him on the team for the next 10-15 years. You can't teach court vision.    Everyone who says we should've drafted Okafor wasn't really following the draft. We knew Okafor was the most NBA-ready of the bunch. It's not about the present, it's about the future."
lakers,3dg4bh,cntrft,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:02:52 2015 UTC,I agree. It gave him a little taste of how NBA ball is played vs college. He's gonna be watching tape and contemplating until October. It's gonna motivate him. #Loading

lakers,3dg4bh,cntrft,4,Thu Jul 16 03:43:43 2015 UTC,"We're not after players to play with Kobe, we're after guys who will carry the torch when he's done."
lakers,3dg4bh,maxypooh15,-4,Thu Jul 16 04:28:19 2015 UTC,"fine don't imagine kobe, but you gotta admit, Okafor would've been a better pick, and lakers did have that chance."
lakers,3dg4bh,IamKlutcH,5,Thu Jul 16 04:42:36 2015 UTC,im sure chicago fans that wanted Beasley were saying the same thing
lakers,3dg4bh,WhiteAdipose,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:48:39 2015 UTC,No one has to admit anything about any player right now.  They haven't even gone through their first training camp so how can you judge who was the better pick so soon?
lakers,3dg4bh,muffhug,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:44:38 2015 UTC,"There's no point saying x team should've picked y player anymore..   The trailblazers should've picked Durant. Curry got picked 7th, Kobe got picked 13th. Are any of the FOs that passed on these players crying about it? Doubtful.   This ""we should've picked Okafor"" stuff is all irrelevant and doesn't add anything to the discussion of moving forward. Dwelling on the past is dumb as shit and does nothing to help you succeed in the future."
lakers,3dg4bh,ynksjts,-3,Thu Jul 16 06:31:00 2015 UTC,I think it's fine to say we shouldn't be worried but I think it's pretty dumb to say you're actually glad he's struggling. I dont know about you but I'd much rather see him dominating the summer league right now.
lakers,3dg4bh,Sletts,-13,Thu Jul 16 13:59:53 2015 UTC,"Knick fan checking in, I don't think his play is a positive at all.  His lack of quickness and his turnovers are alarming trends."

lakers,3dg4bh,muffhug,2,Thu Jul 16 02:30:49 2015 UTC,I think all you are experiencing is that a large percentage of stupid humans think and act in similar ways and in the end we are all the same just from different areas cheering for different colors.  Now go back to New York.

lakers,3dg4bh,muffhug,2,Thu Jul 16 14:22:24 2015 UTC,"hey man if that's how you feel then good for you, but i guarantee you this experience will make him work harder and become a better player."
lakers,3dg4bh,muffhug,0,Thu Jul 16 12:10:09 2015 UTC,"What other situation would you prefer someone struggled over having success? Kobe scored 36 in one of his.

lakers,3dg4bh,WesJohnsonGOAT2024,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:21:17 2015 UTC,haha so serious. all i'm saying is that there are positives to be taken out of being humbled. that video that was posted yesterday of kobe airballing those 3 pointers during the playoffs? he was humbled and it was a good thing.
lakers,3dg4bh,muffhug,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:42:25 2015 UTC,"That's my point, there's a fine line between being positive and being delusional and this post is the epitome of the latter. And seeing other fans agree with this bs is a sorry sight."

lakers,3dg4bh,ficklefart,0,Fri Jul 17 00:33:35 2015 UTC,"If Kobe doesnt airball 4 3s in a row then he doesn't work on his 3 nonstop and doesn't hit all the game-winning, game-tying 3s he did in his career. Losing is a much bigger motivation than winning, just ask the 2009 Lakers or the 2014 Spurs."
lakers,3dg4bh,Lightning14,0,Fri Jul 17 00:53:26 2015 UTC,"So you would much rather a team lose a championship in the finals every single year so that they keep getting better rather than actually winning the championship every year? Lol. This is the dumb bs I'm talking about. These guys play so much basketball at practice that they know their strengths and weaknesses inside out. They know if a shot is going in as soon as it leaves their fingertips, and its not gonna take kobe 4 straight missed 3s in a row to make him want to practice his 3s. He's always been the most motivated player on the team despite his 5 rings. Your dumb argument is dumb."
lakers,3dg4bh,ynksjts,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"Yea, having a bad summer league is equal to losing the finals every year. Nice slippery slope. I gave you rational examples of losing having a positive effect. The story of Kobe practicing the 3 comes from Horry. I guess You weren't around for Kobe's 4 air balls in a row against the Jazz as a rookie. Horry said that Kobe obsessed over perfecting his 3 after that, not before. There's a reason why most MMA fighters were bullied as kids, why most CEOs are dyslexic. The things we become embarrassed by have an incredible ability to motivate us to find alternative paths to succeed."
lakers,3dg4bh,ProductofNyc,0,Fri Jul 17 00:40:15 2015 UTC,I'm not arguing that losing has no positive effects. I'm battling the dumb illusion that you would rather him be struggling than succesful right now. You are sitting here talking about kobe when he himself had a great SL performance. You're killing your argument.
lakers,3dg4bh,justgivingsomeadvice,8,Fri Jul 17 01:27:47 2015 UTC,Turnovers are probably due to Madson installing the Princeton offense in a couple of days and D'lo lack of chemistry with his teammates. His quickness can be fixed easily. You ever heard of leg day? Best way to get quick is lower body workouts which he will do a lot of I hope.
lakers,3dg4bh,TuneHD,0,Fri Jul 17 02:09:48 2015 UTC,"Only to a degree. You can't teach athleticism, and it was well known he's not coming into the league with the overwhelming athleticism that a lot of the top point guards in the league did. Not saying he won't become a good to great player, but if he does it will be in developing very good skills and decision making."
lakers,3dg4bh,zzyyxxqq,-1,Thu Jul 16 01:48:51 2015 UTC,I guess when he's doing legs your hoping his competition is going to take it easy and let him catch up to them.  He'll improve but probably will never be an elite athlete like Mudiay.
lakers,3dg4bh,ProductofNyc,-4,Thu Jul 16 02:04:26 2015 UTC,"You can't teach or train someone to be ""Quick"" at the pro level. You either got it or you don't. Can't believe someone Upvoted this silly comment talking about leg day lol"

We will be seeing a lot of him because he's gonna play for Duke. Right now Simmons looks like your typical tweener, but can't judge him too much right now."
lakers,3dk0cg,TimeisIllmatic95,7,Thu Jul 16 23:10:10 2015 UTC,"Those are the only two guys from the 2016 Draft I've heard about, so I guess I'd be happy with either of them too."
lakers,3dk0cg,hobojarpen,6,Thu Jul 16 22:07:41 2015 UTC,"Ben all the way. In a recent interview with Draft Express at the Nike Hoop Summit, he said he envisions himself as a SF in the NBA. This might be too early, but I think he might be the most highly touted player since Anthony Davis. He's drawn some LBJ comparisons too. If we get him, all we need is a center and we got a really nice starting lineup. Some other guys to look out for are Jaylen Brown, Brandon Ingram, and Malik Newman.  Interview link: http://youtu.be/NExfdy_Z0GI"

lakers,3dk0cg,PaperDesk,2,Thu Jul 16 22:13:51 2015 UTC,"It's way to early to say.   At the beginning of last year most mock drafts had Cliff Alexander a top 5 pick and didn't have Justice Winslow being drafted at all. Of course Cliff Alexander was undrafted and Winslow went at 10.   We really don't have much exposure of anyone at this point so it's basically worthless to speculate. Especially handing out compliments like ""most talented player since AD"" when all we have are High School games, a few skill academy's, and an all star game or two. Give it some time before we start speculating."
lakers,3dk0cg,LAKE_SHOW_LOADED,2,Fri Jul 17 03:37:09 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Ben Simmons is the consensus #1 pick right now...
lakers,3dk0cg,FuriousFlex,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:51:31 2015 UTC,We need to be bottom 3 to keep the pick? Instead of 5? Damn
lakers,3dk0cg,StealthRUs,2,Fri Jul 17 09:25:00 2015 UTC,"Ben Simmons, all the way.  If they fuck up that pick, Jeanie should fire Jimmy and Mitch immediately."
lakers,3dk0cg,devotedhero,2,Thu Jul 16 23:26:38 2015 UTC,Well Ben Simmons is pretty much projected to be the undisputed #1 at the moment. Couple that with the fact that your pick isn't even guaranteed (or likely for that matter) to be yours... and yeah... it's pretty easy to fuck up I would say
lakers,3dk0cg,StealthRUs,2,Thu Jul 16 23:54:10 2015 UTC,That's not really fucking up the pick if you don't have a chance to draft him.  Fucking up the pick is passing on him when you have the chance to draft him.
lakers,3dfxwf,gpholmes1,7,Wed Jul 15 23:29:53 2015 UTC,Loving his energy thus far. Hopefully he can be less passive in terms of offense.

lakers,3dhase,lebronsucks123,6,Thu Jul 16 07:12:45 2015 UTC,I think letting go of Jerry West is a valid point. He's a great talent evaluator I respect the shit out of him.   Other than that everyone knows first take is just highly reactionary. Its entertainment nothing more
lakers,3dhase,Tekdepledj,3,Thu Jul 16 20:40:02 2015 UTC,"Sad to see Jerry West go, but I don't get why they blamed Jim Buss on that. SAS and Bayless hardly do any research.  It's well known that West doesn't get along with Phil Jackson (a history that even goes back to their days as opposing NBA players) and according to West's autobiography (and I think also Roland Lazenby's book on the Lakers), West hired Jackson knowing full well that he'd bring a ring to the Lakers, but that it might mean that he'd have to eventually quit the front office. After Jackson banned West from the Lakers locker room, that was the last straw for West in already a contentious relationship and he eventually resigned.  Of course, I'd like to see Jerry West back, too, as whenever he speaks about the Lakers, you can tell his heart still bleeds Purple & Gold, but West is grooming his son Jonnie West to become a successful GM, as his son is now assistant GM for the Warriors, so I'm not sure if West would come back, at least, not right now.  But all is not lost, the Lakers already have West's other son, Ryan West, as scouting director the Lakers, so there is still some West influence on the Lakers. I've heard good things about Ryan West, and word has been spreading about him, so much so, that the Sacramento Kings wanted to poach him recently from the Lakers."

lakers,3dhase,Tekdepledj,10,Fri Jul 17 08:14:08 2015 UTC,"I posted this because it was hilarious to watch them pretend like they know whats going on in the Lakers organization. Jim messed up on the coaching hires, but he's been working in the organization for a while. He played a role in drafting Bynum.   As for D'Angelo, it's convenient how they decided to rip on him after a few bad games. I can't wait until he proves the haters wrong. How the hell are these clowns saying that the Lakers hinted at having an agreement with a FA big man? That was pure speculation outside of the organization.   Also, how do they think the Lakers are trying to get Kobe his 6th ring this year. Everything the Lakers have done so far has been to rebuild. Stephen A is a complete idiot for even considering WCS for the 4th pick lol. Just shows how much of a joke these ""journalists"" are."

lakers,3dg3b8,p00rdude,8,Thu Jul 16 02:04:43 2015 UTC,"russells three point has been consistently short, that shows he hasnt adjusted fully from the ncaa hoop. Give him his time I aint worried at all"
lakers,3dg3b8,Sickfire22,5,Thu Jul 16 00:46:55 2015 UTC,Yea they always look pretty accurate just short which is fine
lakers,3dg3b8,OnlyinVegas,7,Thu Jul 16 00:57:44 2015 UTC,What. The. Fuck. Was. That.

lakers,3dg3b8,Scabandiri,6,Thu Jul 16 00:43:14 2015 UTC,This guy needs to shut the fuck up already. Hes shitting on russell like crazy
lakers,3dg3b8,supermaor23,6,Thu Jul 16 00:38:27 2015 UTC,Brown you gotta make that shot...
lakers,3dg3b8,ZombieSquatch,6,Thu Jul 16 00:46:55 2015 UTC,DOEEEEE!!!
lakers,3dg3b8,VladDracul_III,6,Thu Jul 16 00:51:55 2015 UTC,"Surprised the announcer didn't complain about that pass from D'Lo there. ""yeah the guy made the shot but he could've been more open with a more gooder pass"""
lakers,3dg3b8,ConstableOfGrammar,5,Thu Jul 16 00:54:02 2015 UTC,whos dick did this announcer suck to get on air?

lakers,3dg3b8,John_The_Reddit_Man,6,Thu Jul 16 01:35:34 2015 UTC,guys russell only has 3 TO's...making improvements
lakers,3dg3b8,BerriesNCreme,7,Thu Jul 16 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"Weird play call at the end by Madsen. But the team played so much better compared to the Knicks game. Especially Randle, showed he was able to get to the rim often. Russell cutback on his to's. Clarkson was just being Clarkson."
lakers,3dg3b8,p321p,5,Thu Jul 16 02:19:15 2015 UTC,does no one on this fucking team play defense?!?!?!?!
lakers,3dg3b8,BerriesNCreme,5,Thu Jul 16 02:28:34 2015 UTC,THAT IS HOW YOU FOUL SOMEONE
lakers,3dg3b8,Tdoggy13,6,Thu Jul 16 00:45:36 2015 UTC,DOWNTOWN BROWN.   edit: i'm calling him this from now on.
lakers,3dg3b8,blueandgoldLA,5,Thu Jul 16 01:49:13 2015 UTC,Holy hell this commentator wont stop.
lakers,3dg3b8,p00rdude,5,Thu Jul 16 01:56:19 2015 UTC,"Jabari Brown has shown some nice things but I still feel like every possession he touches the ball, he is determined to shoot it."
lakers,3dg3b8,billsfan13,7,Thu Jul 16 01:58:32 2015 UTC,It really took Mark Madsen 2 timeouts to come up with that play?
lakers,3dg3b8,dirtyboob,8,Thu Jul 16 02:03:50 2015 UTC,"This guy keeps calling him ""Clarkston"". Pissing me off"

lakers,3dg3b8,sharkytowers76,2,Thu Jul 16 00:34:08 2015 UTC,No shit right.
lakers,3dg3b8,Scrotal-Recall,4,Thu Jul 16 00:44:10 2015 UTC,These refs are biased as fuck. Nance was clearly fouled.
lakers,3dg3b8,Entei11,4,Thu Jul 16 00:49:36 2015 UTC,"That shot by randle reminds me too much of the shot he threw up last year summer league to win the game and got bailed out by clarkson. Sometimes rankle throws up absolute garbage, better game today but you can't be doing that"
lakers,3dg3b8,gspence001,4,Thu Jul 16 01:52:41 2015 UTC,russ looking like james harden on that last turnover alright
lakers,3dg3b8,BerriesNCreme,4,Thu Jul 16 02:17:32 2015 UTC,Lol of course that's how this game ends
lakers,3dg3b8,billsfan13,2,Thu Jul 16 02:21:09 2015 UTC,"I was pre-jaculating for a D'lo game winning 3, and instead..."
lakers,3dg3b8,bul1dog,7,Thu Jul 16 02:22:01 2015 UTC,"Russell with the beautiful pass and gottlieb""eh well"""
lakers,3dg3b8,SlightlyRyan,3,Thu Jul 16 02:23:33 2015 UTC,There you go Randle!
lakers,3dg3b8,ZombieSquatch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:01:29 2015 UTC,Letting things come to him.  And they are coming indeed.  Nicely done thus far.
lakers,3dg3b8,sharkytowers76,4,Thu Jul 16 00:35:09 2015 UTC,my problem right now is why is randle playing so high up like hes a guard he should be on the block. Otherwise hes just gonna end up with offensive fouls
lakers,3dg3b8,kemar7856,3,Thu Jul 16 00:39:41 2015 UTC,We're looking pretty good so far today. Need more Upshaw.
lakers,3dg3b8,manolo88,2,Thu Jul 16 00:39:58 2015 UTC,he aint even stretch doe
lakers,3dg3b8,jahziIIa,3,Thu Jul 16 00:43:49 2015 UTC,how long is dallas gonna have possession
lakers,3dg3b8,BerriesNCreme,2,Thu Jul 16 00:53:58 2015 UTC,"Russell is playing better, but he needs to tighten up his defense."
lakers,3dg3b8,Dochoa831,3,Thu Jul 16 01:07:08 2015 UTC,Seeing Justin Anderson just ball out keeps reminding me how desperately I wanted him to fall to us at #27 :(
lakers,3dg3b8,Holajuwon34,3,Thu Jul 16 01:11:15 2015 UTC,Why are all of Dallas' players like 25 years old?
lakers,3dg3b8,ConstableOfGrammar,3,Thu Jul 16 01:15:02 2015 UTC,Clarkson going Kobe mode
lakers,3dg3b8,Scabandiri,4,Thu Jul 16 01:32:27 2015 UTC,"randle gotta finish my man, but great positioning"
lakers,3dg3b8,BerriesNCreme,4,Thu Jul 16 01:33:57 2015 UTC,wow nice move by russell
lakers,3dg3b8,neetgeek,3,Thu Jul 16 01:36:17 2015 UTC,Damn fam see yall next year
lakers,3dg3b8,Scabandiri,3,Thu Jul 16 02:02:59 2015 UTC,gutted fam...this weak ass rebounding team
lakers,3dg3b8,BerriesNCreme,3,Thu Jul 16 02:19:14 2015 UTC,Randle has no awareness at all.
lakers,3dg3b8,Entei11,3,Thu Jul 16 02:19:50 2015 UTC,What the hell was that
lakers,3dg3b8,DUBBZZ,4,Thu Jul 16 02:20:18 2015 UTC,"hello darkness, my old friend."
lakers,3dg3b8,neetgeek,3,Thu Jul 16 02:21:47 2015 UTC,Lol..Mark Madsen making Byron look like the GOAT
lakers,3dg3b8,njain4,3,Thu Jul 16 02:22:00 2015 UTC,"Hey, on the bright side, randle finally had a good game and d'lo looks like he was finally figuring things out towards the end of the game!"
lakers,3dg3b8,kawikaboy12,3,Thu Jul 16 02:22:34 2015 UTC,This is going to be a loooooooooong fucking season! :(
lakers,3dg3b8,randy88moss,2,Thu Jul 16 02:28:22 2015 UTC,Just slow down guys! We can do this!
lakers,3dg3b8,SSD65,2,Thu Jul 16 02:23:03 2015 UTC,The key to this game is Randle and Clarkson!
lakers,3dg3b8,Dochoa831,2,Thu Jul 16 00:16:25 2015 UTC,"Lets just hope this game is somewhat watchable, like the first 2 games we played, and not like the last one."
lakers,3dg3b8,Citizen_of_Atlantis,2,Thu Jul 16 00:28:07 2015 UTC,Randle baby
lakers,3dg3b8,SPMrFantastic,2,Thu Jul 16 00:29:41 2015 UTC,yes! a jumpshot from julius!
lakers,3dg3b8,ohveeohexoh,2,Thu Jul 16 00:36:58 2015 UTC,This announcer doesn't know anyone's fucking name.
lakers,3dg3b8,DUBBZZ,2,Thu Jul 16 00:38:41 2015 UTC,What the fuck is this charger commercial.
lakers,3dg3b8,p00rdude,2,Thu Jul 16 00:52:51 2015 UTC,Randle looks GREAT.
lakers,3dg3b8,ZombieSquatch,2,Thu Jul 16 00:55:05 2015 UTC,Jordan Clarkson like a boss.
lakers,3dg3b8,anyonebutme,2,Thu Jul 16 00:59:45 2015 UTC,Man I didn't realize how black hole-ish Randle is.
lakers,3dg3b8,cantankerous_ozu,2,Thu Jul 16 01:08:17 2015 UTC,cant get a rebound jesus
lakers,3dg3b8,BerriesNCreme,2,Thu Jul 16 01:08:34 2015 UTC,Gosh Justin Anderson is playing really good right now.   And this announcer is way better than the announcer from the Knicks game a couple days ago.
lakers,3dg3b8,p321p,2,Thu Jul 16 01:09:40 2015 UTC,One thing that bugged me about the announcer is when he was talking about the depth chart of JC and DLo both at the one. If he did a little research he would know that the lakers are planning on playing both of them at the 1 and 2 and Kobe at the 3. You don't get Lou Will as a starting 2. Smh
lakers,3dg3b8,hotsrirachacha,2,Thu Jul 16 01:16:17 2015 UTC,Randle is dominating this game
lakers,3dg3b8,ConstableOfGrammar,2,Thu Jul 16 01:27:35 2015 UTC,Man Randle is having a hard time finishing. Should come with time though
lakers,3dg3b8,njain4,2,Thu Jul 16 01:34:46 2015 UTC,Interesting how all the pick and rolls are going towards the sideline. Once they start doing it in the middle of the floor Russell may have more space to do his thang
lakers,3dg3b8,Brait002,2,Thu Jul 16 01:35:39 2015 UTC,Lol Clarkson being pulled side to side by Tyler and Black.
lakers,3dg3b8,p321p,2,Thu Jul 16 01:38:44 2015 UTC,Fuck these refs and their one sided moving screen shit
lakers,3dg3b8,Entei11,2,Thu Jul 16 01:39:08 2015 UTC,J Brown lookin very impressive
lakers,3dg3b8,mjith,2,Thu Jul 16 01:43:54 2015 UTC,uhh that was not how you handle full court press lol
lakers,3dg3b8,BerriesNCreme,2,Thu Jul 16 01:46:06 2015 UTC,Come on refs. Nance set that up perfectly. Guess the refs are sticking to the no calls in the final secs lol.
lakers,3dg3b8,p321p,2,Thu Jul 16 01:51:07 2015 UTC,I'm not one to complain about refs for a sl game but holy shit they suck
lakers,3dg3b8,Scabandiri,2,Thu Jul 16 01:53:11 2015 UTC,dlo set up doe
lakers,3dg3b8,BerriesNCreme,2,Thu Jul 16 01:55:16 2015 UTC,dude calling our ticky tac fouls like they got something on a sl game
lakers,3dg3b8,BerriesNCreme,2,Thu Jul 16 01:59:29 2015 UTC,D'Lo is a good passer
lakers,3dg3b8,Amaerica,2,Thu Jul 16 02:00:31 2015 UTC,That Weems guy for Dallas is pretty good...espcially on Defense.
lakers,3dg3b8,randy88moss,2,Thu Jul 16 02:01:52 2015 UTC,DLO playing a great game
lakers,3dg3b8,manolo88,3,Thu Jul 16 02:02:58 2015 UTC,russ cant make a 3 to save his life right now
lakers,3dg3b8,BerriesNCreme,2,Thu Jul 16 02:03:47 2015 UTC,That waymes dude is making a roster
lakers,3dg3b8,Scabandiri,2,Thu Jul 16 02:08:25 2015 UTC,"Def. Do we have anyone on our roster who can defend as well as he does? Russell couldn't even put the ball on the floor (without someone setting a pick) when Waymes was on him. Clarkson handled it a little better, but still."
lakers,3dg3b8,white_on_white,2,Thu Jul 16 02:09:21 2015 UTC,These refs are wack. Watch them give Dallas free throws to win it.
lakers,3dg3b8,Entei11,2,Thu Jul 16 03:01:31 2015 UTC,"Would love for Russell to hit the game winner, then watch the announcer eat crow."
lakers,3dg3b8,Pop_Quiz_Hot_Shot,3,Thu Jul 16 02:16:08 2015 UTC,WTF RUSSELL?
lakers,3dg3b8,ashishvp,2,Thu Jul 16 02:16:53 2015 UTC,Better performance today but still stupid plays and lack of finishing. Bleh. Waiit for preseason
lakers,3dg3b8,thevisitor,2,Thu Jul 16 02:21:46 2015 UTC,why is that the last shot we take!!!???
lakers,3dg3b8,SPMrFantastic,2,Thu Jul 16 02:22:27 2015 UTC,Mark Madsen blows. Last 8 mins all isos. Last shot was literally wtf
lakers,3dg3b8,Scabandiri,2,Thu Jul 16 02:22:45 2015 UTC,On the plus- Jabari was great today
lakers,3dg3b8,thevisitor,2,Thu Jul 16 02:23:56 2015 UTC,"There were some slipups but let's look on the bright side. They looked much better today for fairly significant stretches of time. That has to count for something. ESPECIALLY Randle, who while still making some rookie mistakes, looks as if he is surging back from his injury."
lakers,3dg3b8,jrerik95,2,Thu Jul 16 02:27:51 2015 UTC,DOOOOOOOOOOOEEEEEEEEE  Randle and Russell are looking much better today
lakers,3dg3b8,DocsPillRush,3,Thu Jul 16 02:35:12 2015 UTC,"When you see what this guy looks like, it explains a lot"
lakers,3dg3b8,supermaor23,3,Thu Jul 16 00:55:06 2015 UTC,Russ has missed like 20 3s in a row
lakers,3dg3b8,Scabandiri,4,Thu Jul 16 01:27:41 2015 UTC,"He's missing short, and not wide so just needs to adjust to the nba 3"
lakers,3dg3b8,OnlyinVegas,3,Thu Jul 16 02:08:01 2015 UTC,That last play setup was hideous
lakers,3dg3b8,thevisitor,3,Thu Jul 16 02:13:49 2015 UTC,Ya let's have Randle be the guy who comes towards the ball. Pretty pathetic Madsen couldn't come up with something better than that.
lakers,3dg3b8,ceelogreen5,3,Thu Jul 16 02:23:06 2015 UTC,Is Mark Madsen dyslexic? Was there even a play there? Wtf did they expect to happen giving it to Randle at the top
lakers,3dg3b8,Gardeon,3,Thu Jul 16 02:24:26 2015 UTC,"I want to punch this illiterate fuckboy announcer flush in the larynx if he says ""Clarkston"" one more time."
lakers,3dg3b8,ConstableOfGrammar,3,Thu Jul 16 02:23:18 2015 UTC,Upshaw with the stare-down god damn.
lakers,3dg3b8,Symbiocean,5,Thu Jul 16 00:59:43 2015 UTC,"lol i thought he was just seeing if he was okay, but I like this more"
lakers,3dg3b8,jahziIIa,2,Thu Jul 16 01:45:49 2015 UTC,It finally clicked! Dallas pg looks like Michael Angarano.
lakers,3dg3b8,p321p,2,Thu Jul 16 01:46:31 2015 UTC,nobody moved  wtf was drawn up
lakers,3dg3b8,Theingloriousak2,2,Thu Jul 16 02:21:03 2015 UTC,"Good to see that nothing from Randle's game translates to anything good, like most said last game."

lakers,3dg3b8,supermaor23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:40:14 2015 UTC,Luckily I live in Vegas so I can just watch the ESPYs at 8 instead of on the live stream like I was just doing and I can watch this game instead. Cmon Lakers!

lakers,3dg3b8,ZombieSquatch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:38:27 2015 UTC,"Randle looks fantastic so far. He has boxed out, played good D, passed out to the perimeter, and hit a mid range jump shot"
lakers,3dg3b8,LetMeSleepOnIt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:38:37 2015 UTC,the offense is looking much better guys are moving around and not dancing with the ball as much.

lakers,3dh4c7,ape_cage,0,Thu Jul 16 20:33:36 2015 UTC,Probably Kobe at some point this season
lakers,3dh4c7,CalmerThanYouAreDood,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:47:28 2015 UTC,Any chance Lou will start at the 1 and bass will start at the 4 so we can ease in the rookies a bit? I mean we want to give the rookies experience but we also want to win games.
lakers,3dh4c7,Neilmev,2,Thu Jul 16 20:45:29 2015 UTC,"No chance that Lou will start at the 1. I'm not seeing it likely, but it is possible that both D'Angelo and Julius will come off the bench. If that's the case we'll run something like:  PG: Clarkson SG: Kobe SF: Swaggy PF: Bass C: Hibbert  There's no reason to have Clarkson come off the bench after what he showed last season."
lakers,3dh4c7,Neilmev,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:57:41 2015 UTC,Why is there no chance for Lou to play the 1? He's 6-1 and was 6th man of the year last year so he's clearly pretty good  Plus swaggy hasn't done much for the lakers.   If we are putting the best players on the court on day 1 then shouldn't he be included until Russell is ready?
lakers,3dh4c7,CalmerThanYouAreDood,2,Thu Jul 16 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"You should note that he won 6th Man of the Year by playing SG. He's a ball-stopper who's gonna get his. The only way you can really win 6th Man of the Year is to be either an impeccable defender or to be a chucker, realistically. & Lou's not a very good defender.   I've talked with Toronto fans about Lou. They said Casey would never run plays for Lou at the 1. He's simply not near as effective at the point than at the 2.   He averaged 15.5 pts and 2 assists on 40% FG. Those are some 6th man SG stats. In fact, throughout his career, the highest his assist average has ever been in one season is 4.2, and that's because he started 38 games that year.   Now don't get me wrong. Lou is gonna get minutes, baby. And due to our lack of PG depth, I'm certain there will be instances that he'll play point. But he should never be our starting PG if Russell or Clarkson are available."
lakers,3dh4c7,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:26:00 2015 UTC,"Well he could guard the one and play off of Kobe/Clarkson, but I agree he's best suited as a scoring punch off the bench."
lakers,3dh4c7,1violentdrunk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:50:08 2015 UTC,Nah. Throw the rooks in there. Let bench players be bench player s doesn't stop you from adjusting minutes however you want to.
lakers,3dh4c7,CalmerThanYouAreDood,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:19:51 2015 UTC,"We need an athletic, defensive minded SF and a backup pg. I'd rather clarkson transition to Sg full time and work on his off ball movements and cuts. Also his outside shot."
lakers,3dh4c7,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:54:28 2015 UTC,He also plays PF so who gives a shit if he can shoot. Also he's athletic af
lakers,3dgbss,gspence001,7,Thu Jul 16 01:24:54 2015 UTC,SL shit don't count and they are likely trying different lineups to see how Upshaw handles it.
lakers,3dgbss,denimourson,7,Thu Jul 16 02:44:23 2015 UTC,I don't think he's in shape yet.
lakers,3dgbss,Ttown1,2,Thu Jul 16 02:54:52 2015 UTC,He's out of shape. It's pretty apparent he's gassed after a few minutes. I'm sure he'll be ready to go by the start of the season.
lakers,3dgbss,ape_cage,3,Thu Jul 16 16:43:00 2015 UTC,He definitely has to learn how to not get caught in doing those illegal screens... jeeze... 3 fouls in less than a minute
lakers,3dgbss,Side-Pocket,3,Thu Jul 16 07:28:42 2015 UTC,"i blame those on the point guard, they release before he has a chance to get set"
lakers,3dgbss,GeraltsBeard,2,Thu Jul 16 11:23:04 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'm hoping Mad Dog is just stashing him. hiding him from the scouts. Seriously, give Upshaw some playing time. It's not like we're running a fast-paced offense anyway."
lakers,3dgbss,bhl0713,5,Thu Jul 16 05:22:40 2015 UTC,Didn't we already sign him?

lakers,3dgbss,ceelogreen5,10,Thu Jul 16 02:23:10 2015 UTC,0 fouls in the first half though...
lakers,3dfmej,ginbooth,10,Wed Jul 15 22:01:31 2015 UTC,"I do think it's amazing how Kobe bounced back from this to achieve all he has. 4 clutch time airballs in the playoffs as a rookie? He was what, 18 years old? That sort of experience can derail someone's career completely, but it only pushed Kobe to eventually become a top 10 at worst NBA player of all time. Incredible."
lakers,3dfmej,Holajuwon34,4,Wed Jul 15 22:29:10 2015 UTC,"It was a good insight into Kobe that he air balls 3 times...still has zero hesitation to shoot a 4th time.  I don't remember, but I'm sure there were shots in between."
lakers,3dfmej,CalcBros,3,Wed Jul 15 23:43:55 2015 UTC,I got him top 1. I'm biased though.
lakers,3dfmej,diondrems,4,Thu Jul 16 04:12:48 2015 UTC,I love Russell and I think he is going to be great but you can't compare the playoffs to the summer league.
lakers,3dfmej,wherearetheoreos,3,Wed Jul 15 22:54:55 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.  I think I'm just frustrated especially with the rumor going around that Kupchak preferred Okafor, but Buss overrode him."
lakers,3dfmej,Scabandiri,4,Wed Jul 15 22:56:58 2015 UTC,"I mean you could say that about every rookie who struggled ever. Cant just ignore faults by showing how an arguably top 5 player ever airballed again and again one game in the playoffs as a rookie after having a solid season and destroying summer league. That said, I'm not worried at all about Russ. Impressed by JC, Black. Lance is a project player, Brown is mehh and Randle has shown glimpses of a combination of speed and power that is unparalleled and that can catapult him into a superstar, but also laziness, mental lapses, no hustles, low bball iq, tunnel vision. I'm not worried about his finishing or jumpshot, he's been injured for 9 months"
lakers,3dfmej,BerriesNCreme,5,Wed Jul 15 23:32:34 2015 UTC,Someone should tweet this to kobe so he drops 50 next time we play the jazz
lakers,3dfmej,redundantPOINT,4,Thu Jul 16 02:50:12 2015 UTC,"I'd be more worried if Russell stopped shooting and trying to make his passes because he was afraid of missing and scared of turnovers.   Be like kobe, do what you believe you can do.   That team kobe was on had shaq, a clutch nve, a shooter in Eddie, and I think maybe ceballos. If not Cedric, Horry for sure. But kobe shot the big shots. I'm sure his teammates, coach, and most of all, the fans, were hating hard after that game."

lakers,3dfmej,USCTrojanMJB,-4,Wed Jul 15 23:40:19 2015 UTC,"The only stupid ones are people like you who can't see when someone doesn't have star talent. ""He'll grow!"" ""He's not even 20 yet, let him mature!"" ""He dominated in college!"" ""In Mitch we trust!""  Stop making excuses and use your eyes. Mediocre NBA players make great passes all the time. Some of the smartest, most visionary players on the planet can't even dream of playing NBA ball because they lack the physical talent. Russell has a long road ahead to get better, because his athleticism is weak sauce."
lakers,3dfmej,Kauaileonard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:05:44 2015 UTC,"Um but he will grow, and he Will get better. I don't understand trying to argue the logic of evaluating a player after 3 summer league games. He clearly hasn't had an amazing start, but he hasn't had a horrible one either. The only thing we know for sure is that his job is to play basketball and get in peak shape now. What is your point anyway?

lakers,3dfmej,itsyourdestini,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:48:47 2015 UTC,"Shooting/conditioning vs athleticism - can't compare these 2. No one questions his stroke, it's about how slow he is off picks and in transition, and you can't necessarily develop that unlike your shot. He was much faster in Ohio tho, so this extreme slowness could be just a temporary thing, but he will never be even an above average athlete by the NBA standarts."

lakers,3ddaj4,jahziIIa,3,Wed Jul 15 20:04:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed haha, I think he can take a bit of time to develop and he could become the catalyst we need to be a top franchise again. Especially if Kobe takes on a mentoring role with him and Clarkson. Regardless, the future looks bright."
lakers,3ddaj4,StarlingRover,35,Wed Jul 15 11:55:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know why people are throwing a fit over Russell. He has skills that will transition well to pro level play (court vision, passing etc). It seems a majority of the fanbase is impatient, if anyone wants to see what waiting on talent can do; look no further than Kobe Bryant."

lakers,3ddaj4,BerriesNCreme,3,Wed Jul 15 21:35:06 2015 UTC,when all of the other top picks are doing well its kind of hard to not be down on the kid. Doesnt help that mudiay is balling it out in SL
lakers,3ddaj4,Vottomatic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:31:14 2015 UTC,"Because of his athleticism,  that was his biggest knock on him coming out of college,  he looks slower than I thought,  he can't break down defenders,  and struggles to get to the paint, hopefully he could overcome it with improved shooting and better handles but it ain't looking good"
lakers,3ddaj4,StarlingRover,4,Wed Jul 15 20:14:31 2015 UTC,"Yea I've seen his struggles, and they are real. But it's not crazy to think he finds a way to get better, as the season progresses. It's too early in his career to write him off yet."
lakers,3ddaj4,Vottomatic,2,Wed Jul 15 20:22:28 2015 UTC,"He needs to work on his shot where defenders need to respect it and his handles and he should be alright,  if he's a hard worker as he says he is,  his issues should minimize"
lakers,3ddaj4,thehumangenius23,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:26:28 2015 UTC,"he's got a good shot, he just needs to find ways to get some space.   he'll get that at the NBA level because he's not gonna be first or even second option once the season starts."

He had 8 turnovers last game and like 8 points...throwing the ball 20 feet to the right of a player, dribbling into triple teams, horrible decision making, seems like he just started playing high school ball. Haven't seen him do anything"

lakers,3ddaj4,StarlingRover,0,Wed Jul 15 16:14:58 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen him do anything   Exactly, I'm not ready to say he's a bust just yet because he hasn't shown much. We've gotten glimpses of his passing though, and looks to be his skill that will translate immediately. If he shows no improvement this season then I'll start worrying. But it's way too soon to say he will be a bust."
lakers,3ddaj4,badguymatt,-8,Wed Jul 15 20:29:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly super angry about the whole Russell thing, there's some argument to be made considering he's relatively young. And players like Nance and Upshaw have brought some excitement back, but getting blown out by the T-Wolves and Knicks isn't quite exciting for me as a Laker fan haha."
lakers,3ddaj4,aveydey,20,Wed Jul 15 11:30:42 2015 UTC,Sacramento won the Summer League last year. Take the results of the Summer League with a grain of salt.
lakers,3ddaj4,Cienes,4,Wed Jul 15 13:18:04 2015 UTC,Yeah they're practically rookie pickup games.
lakers,3ddaj4,BionicSix,33,Wed Jul 15 15:43:10 2015 UTC,"If you're struggling to enjoy SL, your expectations are set way too high. Come back to reality... it's all rookies and D-Leaguers playing for the first time."
lakers,3ddaj4,UltraFlyingTurtle,8,Wed Jul 15 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Social media and our thirst for every tidbit has created overreactions to every minute action.  I remember watching original summer league games in the Pyramid at Long Beach - Devean George was our super athletic prospect.  I treat SL games the same now, just your first look at rooks and hangers-on - I just have tons of access now, which I'm super happy about."
lakers,3ddaj4,BionicSix,2,Wed Jul 15 16:02:50 2015 UTC,"I miss the SL at the Pyramid. If you got lucky, you could be sitting next to a player watching the game, or Jerry West, Mitch Kupchack, Magic Johnson, etc. After the game, the players would stream out of the lockers rooms and mingle with fans.  Only hardcore fans attended the SL, so most people were knowledgeable basketball geeks and you could talk about the game with strangers. So much fun, and everything was low key.   A part of me wishes the SL wasn't televised, like it was back then, so rookies can make mistakes without close scrutiny under the gaze of the media.  Back then, you had to go to the games to watch Kobe, or Bynum play. And tickets were cheap!"
lakers,3ddaj4,UltraFlyingTurtle,2,Wed Jul 15 19:49:24 2015 UTC,"Glad to meet a fan!  I agree, it was low key, but you're hanging out with NBA players in the stands - Chris Webber stands out specifically because everyone knew who he was, but everyone acted like it was no big deal and he was cool with everyone.  I used to work out at the gym there too (Frog's) and rookies/younger pros would be there - met Paul Pierce, Michael Olowokandi, and Erick Dampier."
lakers,3ddaj4,Vottomatic,2,Wed Jul 15 20:59:40 2015 UTC,"Nice! Seeing those guys at your gym. Awesome. Didn't know there was one close by.  Yeah, at the Pyramid SL games, everyone was chill when a famous person was nearby. Sometimes little kids would come up and ask for autographs. Rookies were always cool with fans as they weren't famous yet.  I remember in 2005/2006, though, you could tell things were changing -- the hype machine of TV and national media starting to affect some rookies. Newly-drafted Rudy Gay (for Memphis) was sitting in the stands watching 2nd-year Andrew Bynum and rookie Jordan Farmer play on the Lakers SL squad.  Gay's Memphis team would play the next day. I'd see people come up to Gay asking for autographs and he'd ignore them, while his entourage told people he wasn't taking autographs.   It was shocking for us to see, as Gay, while a star in college, was still not that well known yet, and certainly not a super-star in the NBA as he hadn't played a real NBA game yet, so we didn't get his celebrity brush-off attitude. Rookies never brought entourages before. But it was a sign of how increasing media exposure were starting to make college stars insulate themselves from the public. So I get it now, looking back at it, but I still shake my head though, remembering how he denied little kids asking for his autographs, seeing them walk away with sad faces."
lakers,3ddaj4,AllGoldEverything,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:40:41 2015 UTC,"I understand, but his athleticism is what's concerning, if he was shooting 30% but getting where ever he wanted then I would just say he's rusty, just like Drose and Curry struggle, they were getting where ever they wanted but they were just cold missing shots,  Dlo on the other hand looks super slow, can't break down defenders struggles to get to the paint etc.."
lakers,3ddaj4,swaggerqueen16,-3,Wed Jul 15 20:18:12 2015 UTC,if its just rookies and d leaguers shouldnt he be playing better? what will happen when hes going up against westbrook and john wall. dont answer that. i dont want to know
lakers,3ddaj4,ape_cage,9,Wed Jul 15 16:57:12 2015 UTC,He will probably suck.  Thats what happens when you're a 19 year old rookie in the NBA.  Its his time to grow now. To expect him to be even in the same universe as the best players in the NBA right now is absurd.

lakers,3ddaj4,DamnJester,4,Wed Jul 15 16:27:41 2015 UTC,His teammates need to get used to his passing. A lot of it is sharp stuff they're not ready for and a lot of it is bad passing that will go away when he settles down. Bottom line is he needs to settle down and just wait for his teammates to get used to his passes.
lakers,3ddaj4,SevTheNiceGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"And he needs to learn the offense. He's had a couple of practices with the team. Once he is familiar with where everyone should be on the floor, his passing will be so much better."
lakers,3ddaj4,ireddit270,4,Wed Jul 15 23:36:58 2015 UTC,Here is the thing about distribution point guards..   Their production is 100% dependent on the other players completing the plays.   Russel can make 100 passes in a game. But if his team mates are missing the shots then he gets no assists.   If players are fumbling passes then it is seen as a turn over pass from Russel.
lakers,3ddaj4,SevTheNiceGuy,2,Wed Jul 15 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"Isn't that why 'distribution point guards' aren't usually superstar-level players? It's hard to have a high impact on the game, if you don't possess the ability to force the issue against defenses"
lakers,3ddaj4,davensdad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:43:56 2015 UTC,does Russell need to be a super star???  Frankly I don't care about his status in the league. I want him to be good and to help the LAKERS win games.
lakers,3ddaj4,AllGoldEverything,2,Thu Jul 16 20:00:42 2015 UTC,"For each of these Russell's highlights, I can show you 2-3x Okafor's  That doesn't make me feel optimistic at all"
lakers,3ddaj4,blackhillsgold,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:17:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but we can't change what's already happened, so seeing the player we do have do good things raises my spirits a little."

lakers,3dcad9,BerriesNCreme,2,Wed Jul 15 19:46:06 2015 UTC,"Russell's success is more dependent on his teammates than the other guys, who are score first options.

lakers,3dbc9g,NicDwolfwood,15,Tue Jul 14 23:21:22 2015 UTC,I've heard that Steve Kerr doesn't believe in analytics either. But the Warriors still use analytics.
lakers,3dbc9g,GeorgeLovesBOSCO,32,Tue Jul 14 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"I doubt that. Kerr probably doesn't coach solely based on numbers, but he definitely uses them to inform his decisions. Carlisle did the same thing in the 2011 Finals. He had Roland Beechland on his staff (founder of 82games.com) who would give him tips on which lineups were performing well. That's why he decided to start JJ Barea in Game 4 and benched Peja who was doing pretty well throughout the playoffs for them.  That's really all I want Byron to do. Just listen to the analytics while you're making coaching decisions. Statistics aren't meant to make decisions for you, stats are measurements of what has happened and it's up to you to interpret them within the context of your basketball knowledge to decide what moves to make."
lakers,3dbc9g,toomanypumpfakes,7,Wed Jul 15 00:23:45 2015 UTC,"ESPN Radio said that Kerr is for and against analytics depending on who he's around. Around ownership and the front office, he is for analytics. But around the players, he doesn't stress it."
lakers,3dbc9g,GeorgeLovesBOSCO,18,Wed Jul 15 01:10:37 2015 UTC,"That doesn't sound like his opinion changes depends on who he's around, that's just knowing his audience and not bogging the players down with stats when they don't need to worry about the offensive efficiency of a certain lineup.   Tell them to force a guy left, don't tell them it's because that guy shoots 30% from that baseline off of two dribbles."
lakers,3dbc9g,toomanypumpfakes,3,Wed Jul 15 01:54:35 2015 UTC,"THIS. My head spins when I hear people like Chuck and Byron say, ""I don't believe in analytics"" as if it's something mythic. It's information. How can you possibly be against having more information?"
lakers,3dbc9g,xodus112,2,Wed Jul 15 14:49:33 2015 UTC,"Lions and Thompson were discussing it on ESPN a few days ago and a majority of the callers were against it, which is fine, they don't make decisions about the game. But the thing I didn't get was that they were getting defensive about the ""eye ball test"" vs analytics conversation. They couldn't seem to understand that you can, and often do, use the ""eyeball test"" in tandem with analytics.   It was really disappointing to hear fans talk like seeing how a player performs and analyzing where and how they get their best performance is a negative thing."

lakers,3dbc9g,DaHomieBigWick,26,Wed Jul 15 05:39:58 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't understand Byron Scott's stance. Analytics are a tool to be used, they don't tell you how to do things, who to sign, who to play, or any of that. It's not a guidebook. By saying he doesn't believe in them, he's saying he doesn't believe in analyzing trends and understanding the various strengths and weaknesses of different teams or players. Seriously, what does he have to lose by embracing them? What does he even think they are?  It's fine to say analytics don't win championships, or that they don't  tell you who's the best player or team. Neither does pure talent. Neither does excellent coaching. Or luck. You need all of those, so I just don't get his stance. In programming terms, to me it's like saying ""a lot of guys believe in makefiles, I'm not one of them"". You can do what you want without them, but it sure as hell helps."
lakers,3dbc9g,PatronSaintOfUpdog,5,Wed Jul 15 00:37:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. Analytics in this context just means information. Why would you not want all the information when making a decision?

lakers,3dbc9g,SwirlPiece_McCoy,2,Wed Jul 15 08:10:29 2015 UTC,Lakers just moved a new person into an analytics liason role.
lakers,3dbc9g,wanderfound,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:46:18 2015 UTC,The fact that Byron Scott can't coach will be his downfall..analytics usage is the least of his coaching issues.
lakers,3dbc9g,Akvc8,0,Wed Jul 15 04:38:00 2015 UTC,I completely disagree with this. I think Byron is a coach that players respect and therefore will typically play hard for him. I also think when given the right players he can coach a decent defense. The analytics side of him though is so far behind that he'll never be an elite coach in todays nba. It's the main thing holding him back and the main reason that in a couple years we will drop him for a new coach.
lakers,3dbc9g,BABYPUBESS,0,Wed Jul 15 13:19:00 2015 UTC,The whole defensive coach thing is a total farce at this point ...  He hasn't had a a defense better than 26th in his last 4 seasons. Coaches like Thibodeau and Stevens do that often with overachieving bunches (thibs has had multiple injuries to big guys requiring him to literally sign guys off the street). Stevens' talent pool is less than what Byron had in New Orleans and close to the same as in Cleveland..and he STILL got them to be respectable.   His offensive sets are atrocious.   I'm a big scott fan when he played (him and Van exel were the reasons i got into basketball fandom) but he CANNOT coach. He's not adaptable and he doesn't have the skills to get you to be a good coach. He's best served as an assistant.
lakers,3dbc9g,Akvc8,11,Wed Jul 15 19:37:58 2015 UTC,Is there a correlation between using analytics and win percentage? I would like to see that.
lakers,3dbc9g,mazingerz021,18,Tue Jul 14 23:48:07 2015 UTC,There has got to be some sort of statistical analysis for that...
lakers,3dbc9g,_im_on_acid_,13,Tue Jul 14 23:53:18 2015 UTC,"The Rockets, Spurs, Mavericks, and 76ers were all in ESPN's top 10 analytics of all sports teams. Obviously one isn't like the others, but if you look at the top analytically ranked teams in any sport, almost all of them are top teams in their league as well."
lakers,3dbc9g,PatronSaintOfUpdog,0,Wed Jul 15 00:40:46 2015 UTC,"The Rockets, Spurs, and Mavs have been good teams for a while. I don't think they became good because they started using analytics lol"
lakers,3dbc9g,zzyyxxqq,8,Wed Jul 15 03:16:34 2015 UTC,"Remember when the Mavs killed us in the playoffs with Barea?  Their analytics guys were telling them to play him.  Rockets after Yao sucked were pretty much stuck as the 8th-9th seed.  Morey ended up rebuilding the team around this extreme ""3's and rim offense"" and now they're in the WCF  Spurs were one of the first teams to exploit the corner 3 and are top 5 in corner 3's every year.  They also use analytics to determine when to rest Duncan and Ginobili.  Compare to us, where we refuse to exploit the fact a 3 gives you one extra point and our analytics hating coach plays Kobe 35 minutes a game until he tears his rotator cuff"
lakers,3dbc9g,Liquorpuki,9,Wed Jul 15 03:53:32 2015 UTC,"Houston got pretty bad after Yao/Tracy era and Morey was brought in to rebuild the team, doing so in a very specific way"
lakers,3dbc9g,cheeseyone,6,Wed Jul 15 03:45:43 2015 UTC,"That ""very specific way"" was essentially trading trash for James Harden because OKC's ownership didn't want to pay luxury tax.  Where would they be without Harden?  I'm not arguing against analytics, but it's not a coincidence that they became a good team after they got Harden."
lakers,3dbc9g,JustAGuy993,10,Wed Jul 15 04:36:14 2015 UTC,"You still need talent.  Analytics isn't a magic pill.  You pretty much need 2-3 all-stars to win a ring no matter what you do.  Morey's offense = going for 3's and rim.  Look at Houston's shot chart.  Houston is basically going after the highest efficiency shots based on analytics.  Those shots are 3's, where if you shoot above 33%, is the same pointwise as hitting a long 2 above 50%.  Plenty of shooters can hit 3's above 33%.  Meanwhile nobody can hit a long 2 above 50% except Dirk and maybe Bosh.  Other high efficiency shot is at the rim, because it's easy to dunk or hit a layup and if you can't convert you can easily draw a foul.  This is Harden's game to a T.  Meanwhile our team's offense is allergic to the arc and runs a ton of Princeton sets that target that green area."
lakers,3dbc9g,Liquorpuki,4,Wed Jul 15 04:50:31 2015 UTC,This is the perfect explanation.
lakers,3dbc9g,BABYPUBESS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:24:50 2015 UTC,I agree.
lakers,3dbc9g,JustAGuy993,-1,Wed Jul 15 04:53:54 2015 UTC,"At the same time, I think that you need the mid-range shot in your arsenal to succeed in the Playoffs.   Harden gets continually shut down in the Playoffs because teams will just blitz him at the three-point line and try their best to not foul him when he drives. Refs tend to swallow their whistles in the Playoffs and you need to be able to punish them from the 15 foot area to succeed.  The Rockets are taking it to an extreme level IMO. No one on their team is a consistent mid-range jumpshooter and it bites them in the ass every other game."
lakers,3dbc9g,Paladinoras,4,Wed Jul 15 07:49:57 2015 UTC,"Nobody is saying that having a mid range game kills you, they're just saying that taking a higher percentage of shots from three or in the paint is more efficient. And you bring up Harden getting shut down, and I despise Harden so I love him being shut down, but Houston still made it to the Western Conference Finals last year which is pretty impressive with all the competition in the West."
lakers,3dbc9g,BABYPUBESS,2,Wed Jul 15 13:26:05 2015 UTC,"Well, no one is saying you shouldn't take any midrange shots. The first thing the top NBA defenses take away is shots at the rim and the three, so you do have a point that having a a guy or guys who can hit the midrange shot reasonably well is valuable. But that is because that midrange shooter will loosen the opposing defense and allow you to get more of those valuable threes and shots at the rim."
lakers,3dbc9g,xodus112,3,Wed Jul 15 15:13:37 2015 UTC,"Morey has outwardly spoken about the chain of events it took to land Harden and Howard, it was a series of calculated business moves to put themselves in position to land the players while using analytics to identify undervalued players in order to create room for two max players"
lakers,3dbc9g,cheeseyone,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:43:25 2015 UTC,My point is that it was a very unique circumstance that allowed Harden to become available.  If OKC's ownership wasn't so stingy he would still be on the Thunder and what would the Rockets have?  I would bet they would still be mediocre.
lakers,3dbc9g,JustAGuy993,2,Wed Jul 15 04:46:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying it was unique, but in this business those chances are so minimal that you have to set yourself up to capitalize on them.   Clearly, the Lakers have not done this anytime recently"
lakers,3dbc9g,cheeseyone,3,Wed Jul 15 06:14:10 2015 UTC,"ESPN Great Analytics Rankings  The talent you have determines how much mileage the analytics can get out of the roster but all analytics is, is math modeling."
lakers,3dbc9g,Liquorpuki,5,Wed Jul 15 00:41:45 2015 UTC,"those ""harrowing quotes"" were said earlier this year when scott took the post. i don't think they were said by him after this move so i wouldn't completely throw the coach under the bus just yet."
lakers,3dbc9g,ridesthewildcat,18,Wed Jul 15 03:39:21 2015 UTC,"The disconnect became apparent in February when Mitch Kupchak told KSPN/710 that analytics are “of most use to a coaching staff.” Scott, however, said he had no use for them. “I think we’ve got a few guys who believe in them,” he said. “I’m not one of them.”   Sigh"
lakers,3dbc9g,inspector_baj3t,17,Tue Jul 14 23:19:55 2015 UTC,It's not like Byron is going to get us a championship anyways.  He's just a stopgap coach who will help develop the youngsters.

Its a pretty basic explanation of how analytics can be used in basketball.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66ko_cWSHBU  Hope this is useful to some of you.  Personally, I don't see why someone would ignore analytics completely. Its able to take so much information, from so many games and present it in an unbiased manner. Don't get me wrong, analytics should be taken with a grain of salt and should not be the sole criteria for evaluation. But with a smart basketball mind, analytics can uncover trends/patterns we normally wouldn't be able to see ourselves."
lakers,3dbc9g,Tekdepledj,2,Wed Jul 15 04:30:30 2015 UTC,"Good step in the right direction. A little bit worried about Byron's attitude, but the front office is the important piece here. Analytics are useful in running a team but they are most useful in building one."

lakers,3dbc9g,rs1284,2,Wed Jul 15 04:06:23 2015 UTC,I can't see any reason not to employ analytics. I would invest in good programmers and analysts and write my own algorithms. It also seems that it would be pretty easy to test the analytics by running the program with the actual minutes/players played and comparing to the real world results. If they spent $5 million on the effort and it won another 10 games a year it would be totally worth it. Analytics will provide useful information in any case even if it's not a game changer.

It is when it takes another team choking historically and getting blown out by the competition in the conference finals.  But hey, by that logic I guess the Hawks are a top tier team too right?  So once again, 2nd tier team.  They lucked out against the Clips, they got no chance against the Warriors, they don't even belong on a court with the Spurs, and OKC would likely beat them too.

Rockets are 2nd tier I agree, but their FO has done a fantastic job. They got rid of Parsons and Lin, and everyone was like ""they lost key pieces"", but Morey was right - even though stats showed that Parsons at least was valuable, their analytics team determined him to not be, and they were right. Also, rockets didn't have 2 starters in that playoff run either, they had Jason Terry guarding West PG's...just to put some perspective. Analytics isn't everything - but we definitely need to improve that area. For Gods sake our coaching staff doesn't believe in God damn three pointers!!! A grade 2 math student can calculate that the expected value of 3 point shooting destroys the long range 2. We can't even understand this simple analytics problem."

Who wouldn't want to use all the tools available to them?  Saying we shouldn't use analytics is as short-sighted as the stat nerds who say that post-ups are useless in the modern NBA. Use both, build a team with your basketball knowledge and also look at various statistics to inform your opinions.

I remember in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, in the Semi-Final round against Houston, Shane Battier was quoted in a game as having a dossier (I think something around ninety pages, trying to find a clip of the video. He later sent a reduced five page version to Grant Hill the next year). In fact, here's a clip of ]Battier talking about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxcbuV0_WEM). In particular, Battier in this video talks about forcing Kobe to his left to make a pull up jumper. Here's a video of Kobe doing that exact thing to Battier for an and one.  My point is that, an over-reliance on analytics is not going to solve anything. Sometimes it really does come down to the eye test and feeling the moment. Can they be a tool? Sure, but this overblown importance of analytics won't, and I repeat, won't do anything.  -EDIT-  Lol at someone downvoting this, especially without a response."

The Princeton offense looks pretty solid, but some of these plays feel like ""go through these three options and screens and behold your reward: an open long two!""  I think it would be cool to see our Lakers try to copy the warriors a bit. Offensively Randle/Russell can function like a Curry/Screen pick and roll and Kobe and Clarkson can definitely space the floor and attack the rim.  Here's coach Daniel on the Warriors"

lakers,3dazsi,whitejumper,3,Wed Jul 15 00:11:53 2015 UTC,Some notable teams that run the Princeton:  -Early 2000 Kings   -The current Spurs   But why doesn't the Lakers Princeton offense resemble anything like these two? Maybe you need the right personnel? Check out Jason Kidd running the Byron Scott Princeton in 2002.
lakers,3dazsi,UltraFlyingTurtle,3,Wed Jul 15 08:29:23 2015 UTC,"This Princeton offense is based on off-guard off ball movement that creates screens creating space for players into the open zone. Players run curls and options predicating on these players then taking the open 2 pointers. This requires the players being able to read the defense, strong side staggered screens, and play within the princeton rules.     When we are looking at the new guard NBA, they run offense to get players open outside the arc, the spacing rules that force defense to scrambles such that there will be open 3's to look for. Coach Daniels also did a video to show how the Warriors run their offense.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ue5mZZiIgQ    Note how the Warriors runs screens on both Strong side and Weak side to create spacing. If defense intend on staying strong side, then there will be a shooter on weakside open for a 3. Ball handler pass to weakside, and he may or may not take the shot depending whether there is a defender closing. If so, he makes the extra pass to a player rolling to corner open 3. Everyone is running somewhere around the court to create mismatches. If the Lakers would be willing to expand the curls to outside the arc, they can take advantage of the princeton offense they already use. Princeton Offense isnt dead but can be amended for better efficiency. We have the players to do it with, a great guard (Russell), some 3 pt shooters (Kobe,Clarkson, Williams, Anthony Brown, Nick Young), and strong center (Hibbert)"
lakers,3dazsi,mes8007,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:38:12 2015 UTC,"Interesting. Especially the part about expanding the curls outside the arc, which, as you've pointed out, the Lakers don't do.  I've noticed that in Summer League,  Lakers sometimes ran the ""45,"" where the 4 and 5 come up top to set screens on the opposite sides of the man defending the guard bringing up the ball. The big men ""sandwich"" the defender, letting the ball-handling guard free.    Clippers run this to great effect, getting Chris Paul free. So while I was happy that the Lakers did this for D'angelo, who would thrive with this play, it wasn't working that well.   Here's how the Clippers run the ""45"":  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VkmEjBlTMpc]  If you look at the Clippers version, the big men come out way beyond the arc to set the screens. This gives more room for Paul to operate, and he can easily shoot a three.  With the Lakers, the big men set the screens much closer to the arc (or in the arc), creating less room for Russell, and if he does shoot, all he has is a long two, which I guess follow's Byron's policy in limiting three point shots, but it's frustrating. Set the 45 screen higher, and Russell could shoot the three instead of one of the worst shots in basketball, the long two.  Here's a great video explaining the ""45,"" which is called the ""Double Ball Screen"" as part of the HORNS offensive set. https://youtu.be/LccdFcaeifU?t=310"
lakers,3dazsi,Liquorpuki,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:26:03 2015 UTC,"Yes I was curious of the possibility of expanding curls, there's so much room on the court being under utilized. Paints congested and no decent driving lanes. It's like lakers are shooting themselves in the foot."
lakers,3dazsi,mes8007,4,Wed Jul 15 22:56:47 2015 UTC,Lol Mike Brown was fired for running the Princeton.
lakers,3dazsi,jay24k,7,Wed Jul 15 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"Mike Brown's version of the Princeton had Nash passing the ball to Kobe, doing a basketcut and running into MWP in the corner.  Then Nash and MWP would argue about who's supposed to be where for the next 10 seconds"
lakers,3dazsi,Liquorpuki,3,Wed Jul 15 00:30:48 2015 UTC,Yep that's sounds about right..  Don't forget Dwight getting a dumb off ball offensive call somewhere in there too..
lakers,3dazsi,locallyunknown,4,Wed Jul 15 02:15:15 2015 UTC,no second reads or options. predictable. rigid. shitty spacing (how are your guards going to drive when you have your bigs on the elbow all the time?)  basically the antithesis of the current league and the way offenses are trending. lakers need to get rid of scott.
lakers,3dazsi,SwaggyPGOAT,2,Wed Jul 15 00:31:34 2015 UTC,"Video of Lakers running Princeton Chin variations that was posted here last year  One smart thing I liked that Scott did was turning chin into an iso for Kobe (1:11, 2:00).  Kobe does the guard-guard pass and basketcuts.  The guard initiating the pass is supposed to basketcut and get hit for the layup if he loses his guy, otherwise he flashes back out to the sideline.  Instead Scott has Kobe stop near the block, seal his guy in, receive the entry pass, and the team then clears the floor so he can post-up and hit those turnaround fadeaways.  One thing I hated was our guards would always basketcut and never fill the corner because Scott hated 3's.  So you'd have Lin or Ronnie Price basketcut and just hang out 13 feet from the basket near the baseline (0:58, 2:34).  Which is stupid because all they're doing is ruining space."
lakers,3daftk,oneone26,28,Tue Jul 14 19:24:26 2015 UTC,"So there have been guys that killed SL and flopped (Morrison), guys started slow and caught on to be top players in the league (Nash in SL), and guys that were pedal to the metal from the beginning AND kept it going their entire careers (Kobe).  Point is, we have to wait. It's the risk the FO took because of his potential.  Okafor was the sure thing with questionable potential. Russell was the gamble with tons of potential.   Instead of looking for dominance we should be looking for flashes of the potential that will only be fulfilled with time and experience. Potential isn't fulfilled overnight. Remember that."

lakers,3daftk,CalmerThanYouAreDood,14,Wed Jul 15 00:21:50 2015 UTC,"We all see the vision in Russel and he's more than willing to pass. He can shoot and use his body well off pick and roll to shoot the elbow jumper. Most of us are getting tired of the ""its summer league"" excuse but most of Russel's turnovers are him forcing passes that are not there. He needs time to adjust to the NBA defense and be able to exploit it.  Some turnovers are him driving into triple teams and losing the basketball, which should be fixed with a better structured offense and spacing.  He will be a pretty special player in this league and I can see him developing into a 20/5/8 guy three or four years from now."
lakers,3daftk,badguymatt,10,Tue Jul 14 19:30:45 2015 UTC,"Speaking of this, has anyone else been surprised by Russell's ability to rebound the ball? It's been a blessing. I'm pretty sure he brought in 8 rebounds during one of our SL games. I'm glad to see him fight for a rebound as opposed to running down the court and hoping for a fast break, seeing as he's not all too fast."
lakers,3daftk,UltraFlyingTurtle,2,Tue Jul 14 19:36:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he has good fundamentals when rebounding. In the DraftExpress video on Russell, they had clips where he was boxing out big men in the paint, literally shoving all his weight on much taller dude, in order to get the rebound himself or for teammates.   I wish Randle would do the same.   Also, Russell has a decent post-up game as well, backing down similar-sized or smaller guards. We haven't seen that yet in the SL."
lakers,3daftk,EvilJagan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:42:22 2015 UTC,"He has long arms for a point/shooting guard. He uses his body well to pull down those rebounds. And yeah he's game is more of a ""get the rebound and throw a full court pass"" than run the ball down the court. Some of those long passes are really predictable but I'm sure he'll adjust to the NBA defense and find spaces for his pass. I like how he has that conscious effort of pushing the ball down."
lakers,3daftk,xSora08,6,Tue Jul 14 19:40:55 2015 UTC,He's 19 years old ffs. He is not going to be amazing right away. How many of you old laker fans wanted Kobe gone after those airballs?
lakers,3daftk,DUBBZZ,2,Tue Jul 14 23:56:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly, thank god we didn't have this kind of social media or internet back then when Kobe air balled those threes.  We wouldn't see the end of it."
lakers,3daftk,UltraFlyingTurtle,7,Wed Jul 15 04:31:59 2015 UTC,But he's already played 3 whole  Summer League games.  That should be enough for us to determine the success of his entire career.
lakers,3daftk,blabla1624,3,Tue Jul 14 23:55:35 2015 UTC,"I hope Lakers (or Clarkson) can get in touch with Nash to help mentor Russell.

Some are realistic with rookies and rebuilding while some are more eager for results. If anything we have one of the better fan bases.
lakers,3daftk,USCTrojanMJB,5,Wed Jul 15 05:57:14 2015 UTC,People need to stop tripping about how he is playing right now. Let the dude grow as a player and learn! This isnt going to happen overnight! If he is still playing like this 2-3 years from now then it is a legitimate concern but jeeze let him learn from his mistakes. Greatness comes with work and time.
lakers,3daftk,DJQuik,0,Tue Jul 14 20:40:34 2015 UTC,"The problem is, Russell has a clear lack of plus athleticism, his handle was dramatically overrated (he couldn't touch Steph or Kyrie in a million years), and vision might just make you Jose Calderon. Is that the franchise savior? Doubt it.  People want to believe because the down spell for LA has been painful. We need hope. The problem is, Russell isn't that caliber of player. The best players in the league have a clearly unique physical quality about them in addition to their bball skills. Russ's vision doesn't qualify.  Sorry, but at best, he's similar to Deron Williams or a smaller, less dynamic Brandon Roy. A big PG with good vision and average shooting who does a little of everything, but nothing special except understand the game. Nothing wrong if he matures into that, but I have my doubts."
lakers,3daftk,USCTrojanMJB,2,Wed Jul 15 04:28:22 2015 UTC,Way to soon to cap this dude's potential. You've seen him play one year of college and 3 summer league games and you know he's at best going to be Deron Williams?  What makes you think Russell won't develop an amazing physical quality? Being a 6'5 point guard with amazing vision that can rebound the ball....those are pretty good physical qualities.
lakers,3daftk,DJQuik,2,Wed Jul 15 08:23:09 2015 UTC,"People don't develop amazing physical qualities, they're gifted with them. What you mention (vision, rebounding, etc) are basketball skills. They are mostly effort based and can be taught. Some player's natural tendencies lean to one skill over another, but everyone can learn a skill within the context of their own limitations. Think of it like Bruce Bowen understanding he's not a gifted athlete and ball handler who can thrive attacking the rim, so he learned how to shoot the corner 3 to carve out his niche in the league.  Russell needs to focus on learning how to play within himself, but from the way he talks about his game and the hype people are throwing on him, he might end up trying to do things he's just not likely to be good at. Physically limited players require more deliberate coaching and training. Athletic guys like Westbrook, and in this class, Mudiay, are afforded the opportunity to freestyle on the court to discover what they're most comfortable and effective doing, because their athletic talent enables them to pursue nearly anything. Btw, Deron Williams has been an All-Star and a max contract player in the NBA, I don't think that's a diss on Russell."
lakers,3daftk,bad_lifechoices,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:40:18 2015 UTC,"It has nothing to do with how good Williams is. It's that you can't possibly know Russell's ceiling already.   Vision cannot be taught and it is definitely not effort based. If it was then players would develop court vision as their career progressed. That rarely happens.  I agree that he is limited physically. Being a 6'5 point guard is an advantage. He has so much to work on - learn how to use his big body to score at the rack, perfect his handles, develop a jumper. All these things can be learned and add to his already talented game."
lakers,3daftk,USCTrojanMJB,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:37:07 2015 UTC,"What's the unique physical quality of Steph curry, kyrie Irving, Chris Paul, Tony Parker? The only real freak athlete pg in the west is Westbrook isn't it?  Otherwise each one of those guys relies on pure ball skills."
lakers,3daftk,metrofeed,3,Wed Jul 15 13:08:14 2015 UTC,"All of the guys you mentioned have next level quickness. All of them routinely destroy their defender with their first step. For Steph and Kyrie, it amplifies the effectiveness of their handle, allowing them to gain separation and get their own shot virtually at will. Chris Paul was like this when he entered the league. Parker has been on the decline, but still gets his step. For Steph, the quickness is apparent in his jumper as well. He's got amazing technique, but his quickness allows him to get his shot up in a split second.  D'Angelo, through his lone college season, and here in summer league, has not flashed the kind of quickness that will set him apart from the pack. More likely, he'll need to use increasingly crafty ball handling along with his large body to create space. Deron Williams became effective in the NBA because he learned how to play that way. Just look at how many NBA PG's drop off dramatically as their quickness declines. Even a young Derrick Rose post leg injury is an accurate example of this.  What most see as rookie struggles, I see as someone trying to play like Steph Curry and James Harden (another quick step ball handler at the 2), but lacking the quickness to drive past defenders at this level. People are going to say it's court spacing, but he's dribbling into doubles and triples, expecting to have driven by his defender at the point he loses the ball and the window shuts. I'm hoping he learns to use his size to create space rather than thinking he's something he's not."
lakers,3daftk,myLeftTesticleofFury,3,Wed Jul 15 15:27:52 2015 UTC,"Why are we even comparing Russell to Nash or Kobe? The chances of ANY player picked at ANY spot in the draft becoming as good as them is highly unlikely.   The other side of the coin, why compare to someone like Morrisson? The chances of him washing out that spectacularly, while more likely than becoming an all-timer like Kobe or Nash, are still not that likely!"
lakers,3daftk,p0se1d0n,2,Tue Jul 14 23:16:28 2015 UTC,"Upside is important and, for a top 5 pick, should be limitless.  Comparing his potential paths to the paths of other superstars is the right thing to do.  Comparing him to a bust is just disrespectful and cold."
lakers,3daftk,sayheykid24,2,Wed Jul 15 04:41:07 2015 UTC,And Kobe scored 36 points in his first summer league game at the age of 17.  There are 2 sides to every coin
lakers,3daftk,PaperDesk,4,Tue Jul 14 20:23:02 2015 UTC,Top rookies often didn't play summer league back when Kobe was drafted so it wasn't as tough of a league.

Those Suns teams had KJ and Kidd not to mention a ton of vets so situation was completely different and the Suns were a playoff team. Steve Nash was a kid that played 4 years in college in a conference that no one cared about back then.  ""Edit to add 'in college'"""
lakers,3daftk,M3rw1n,2,Tue Jul 14 21:13:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they have the same exact situation, all I'm saying is it takes a couple of years for point guard like Nash and Russel to find fully exploit those passing lanes and reach their potential. We can't call him neither a bust or a stud right now."
lakers,3daftk,myLeftTesticleofFury,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:14:12 2015 UTC,"Why?  It's just a simple piece of evidence to show that some of the most amazing players don't come out and instantly dominate.  I think it's asinine to suggest Russell has that type of struggle ahead of him based on this Nash fact, but it does speak to the importance of letting a player have their rookie season, AT LEAST, before even thinking about spewing the trash-talk that's been leveled towards Russell so far.  Finally, Nash's performance for the Suns isn't as significant as the two years he spent getting starting minutes for the mavs and utterly failing to deliver.  No two situations are alike, but his start with the mavs was a lot closer to what's going on in LA than the unorthodox 4-guards-on-the-court-smallball situation in phoenix if that's what you're looking for."
lakers,3daftk,alexxdim94,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:53:22 2015 UTC,"And that is the problem with the OP. Yes, Russell might have problems. but to use ""evidence"" of Steve Nash is not a very good comparison. Nash is a PG, Russell is a PG, that is all the evidence we have and to use Nash as a comparison is not well IMO. Why not Starbury?"
lakers,3daftk,toshi_X,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:16:26 2015 UTC,"I agree that the OP's premise is a little overboard to the point of deflating reasonable optimism, but Nash's path represents patience resulting in full realization of upside...which is what everyone dogging on Russell needs to hear.  It's easy enough to be optimistic about Russell despite his summer league woes for someone rational like you, but an example that encourages patience is good for everyone else."
lakers,3daftk,myLeftTesticleofFury,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:23:10 2015 UTC,"Im not comparing Nash and Russell. All I'm saying is it will definitely take time before we can see Russell develop, longer than we all first thought it would take. The only reason I put up Nash stats is to show that Lakers shouldn't lose hope quickly and be we have to be patient."
lakers,3daftk,toshi_X,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"Guys, what the actual f*ck, we've only seen him play 3 summer leagues games, why are we jumping to conclusions already???"
lakers,3daftk,sanjugo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:22:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call those numbers atrocious, especially when you factor in minutes played. He shot well in his first two years, and his assits/turnover ratio was ok. Check out his per 36-minutes numbers: http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nashst01.html  His first year in Dallas was pretty bad, though. Not really sure what happened there. But, honestly, I don't see Russell having the type of career that Nash had."
lakers,3daftk,Neilmev,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:33:45 2015 UTC,"I don't see Russell having the type of career that Nash had.   Well, this is the same brand of hot sports opinion as the one that you're replying to.  The only thing you can really take away from Nash's experience is knowledge that it doesn't always happen right away, and it might even seem like it'll never happen.  There's no reason bother worrying about Russell until deep into his rookie season, and even then it might be premature."
lakers,3daftk,sanjugo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:58:02 2015 UTC,That's what I do here on reddit -- share my opinons.
lakers,3daftk,Neilmev,-6,Wed Jul 15 05:24:49 2015 UTC,"Nash's numbers were not atrocious, he was playing backup for several years during REGULAR season games.  Russell is struggling in SUMMER LEAGUE, a completely different scenario and if anything, it should be easier for him in SL since everybody else is new as well."
lakers,3daftk,sanjugo,3,Tue Jul 14 20:10:57 2015 UTC,Actually his stats were pretty terrible. Look at his first 4 years. In year 3 his shooting percentage was .363 and he was playing 32 mins a game. Averaged 7.9 points and 5.5 asst. He made a big leap in his 5th year. Part of that was he had Dirk then and they played so well together.   Point is that even for one of the best point guards of all time it took some time for him to develop so we shouldn't throw our rookie under the bus after two summer league games.
lakers,3daftk,Neilmev,-3,Tue Jul 14 20:41:21 2015 UTC,"Then the same can be said of Jeremy Lin and every other PGs in the league that needed a complimentary big man to fit their game.  Nash averaged 7.2 points in his first 4 years while averaging just 21 minutes a game.  Bear in mind that he played behind Kevin Johnson AND Jason Kidd plus 2 other PGs on that Phoenix team, so his playing time was scattered and inconsistent.   That same team also had 5 other players who shot more 3 pointers than he did.  Unlike Nash, Russell is almost guaranteed to be given a starting role and a complete season workout to work on his game while not having to play behind so many players.  Is Russell better than Lin in their first year for the Lakers?  Hell no!  It's not even close, but Russell will probably be given the green a lot more often because...new young guy.  The Lakers are rebuilding, you can't expect anything else."
lakers,3daftk,myLeftTesticleofFury,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:59:29 2015 UTC,Lin hit his ceiling and it wasn't good enough to be a starting point guard on one of the worst teams in the NBA last season. Obviously D'Angello will get playing time since he's the number 2 pick and he needs experience before he can improve. Only time will tell where his ceiling is.   The point was that the two time NBA mvp and future hall of famer didn't come into the league like a god so we should be patient with Russell since he's only played two summer league games so far. Even in Nash's first year in Dallas he struggled and he was playing solid minutes. It takes time for some players to develop. Hopefully Russell can develop as well.
lakers,3daftk,sanjugo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:56:49 2015 UTC,"No.  Everybody knew that the Lakers only wanted to tank, that was exactly why they hired Scott in the first place.  We haven't seen Lin's ceiling yet because he hasn't had the same kind of talent he had back in New York and Houston, but he's certainly better than any of the point guards that the Lakers have had in years."
lakers,3daftk,myLeftTesticleofFury,0,Wed Jul 15 20:38:10 2015 UTC,Lol
lakers,3daftk,sanjugo,3,Wed Jul 15 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"I was at Reunion Arena watching mavs games when Nash joined up with the mavs.  Dude was literally getting booed off the court for turning the ball over so much during his first season getting starting minutes.  Two years later, he was a top 10 PG."
lakers,3daftk,myLeftTesticleofFury,-10,Tue Jul 14 20:52:19 2015 UTC,"That's strange.  He only average 1.7 turnovers a game and 4.8 assists for the first 20 games.  His next 20 games his turnovers did go up (2.5) but then so did his assist rate (6.7).  Nash was not a popular choice at the time because...white, unathletic etc."
lakers,3daftk,sanjugo,4,Tue Jul 14 21:08:18 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're accusing me of lying, and so I'll just be quick to snap and say...  Fuck you:  http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/steve-nash-tells-jay-leno-being-booed-dallas-163203260--nba.html  edit: Turning it over might have been a little too specific.  He was also chucking bricks.  You really can't blame it on his whiteness when you consider this is Dallas we're talking about."
lakers,3daftk,myLeftTesticleofFury,-9,Tue Jul 14 21:10:53 2015 UTC,"No fuck you.  You can google-circlejerk for all you like to support your lame argument, but numbers don't lie.    Besides, Nash is talking about ONE GAME in his 3rd season after he had just signed a bigger contract with the Mavs and he was having a back injury, not the first season as you pulled out of your ass from,   ""Dude was literally getting booed off the court for turning the ball over so much during his first season getting starting minutes.""   Lying is not the only thing you suck at."
lakers,3daftk,sanjugo,4,Tue Jul 14 21:28:06 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, nice burn on the google circlejerk bro.  Means a lot coming from a guy who went straight to Nash's years as a backup on basketball reference to make an argument against something that hinges on the two years that he sucked ass while starting for the mavs.  The point is...  You said:   he was playing backup   ...and you were wrong.  He started for the mavs, and he sucked.  Badly.  Other than upside, there was no reason for him to be in the starting lineup.  For the record, I was watching the game on TV.  I went to other games during that season.  I've lived in Dallas for most of my life after leaving socal."
lakers,3daftk,myLeftTesticleofFury,-3,Tue Jul 14 21:39:02 2015 UTC,"In 237 games that he played in his first 4 seasons he only started 78 of them, and 40 of them was because Dallas at the time only had 2 PGs, which means that other than that year he only actually started 19% of his games.  Run along now."
lakers,3daftk,Toyota_Halftimeshow,5,Tue Jul 14 21:53:58 2015 UTC,"He averaged starting minutes for both mavs seasons, you cherry-picking stat gimp."

You pulled an article from google's ass to support your argument that he was booed in his first season, where that article is talking about his 3rd season.  The conversation kind of ended back there."
lakers,3daftk,knightfall88,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:16:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, you're still at it?  Nash's 3rd season in the NBA was his first season in Dallas.  That was also the first season where he started consistently and averaged close to 30 minutes....  ""starting minutes.""  edit:  To be honest, I was really pleasantly surprised to find that article in google's ass because I almost felt like I had dreamed the whole thing.  That shit was surreal."
lakers,3daftk,GreenRabite,-7,Wed Jul 15 12:41:36 2015 UTC,"just stop defending him with more and more bizarre stats about other players, its getting ridiculous. Judged by his performance so far, he sucks. Deal with it"

lakers,3di1ir,StuckFern,3,Fri Jul 17 00:14:47 2015 UTC,"I know everyone is shitting on this idea but if Ty Lawson gets waived, y'all would be angry if we swung and trade for Cousins and signed Ty? We could trade Russell Randle and w.e else they want except Clarkson and rock a starting line-up of:  Lawson, Clarkson, Kobe, Cousins, Hibbert   Y'all telling me y'all wouldnt want that? obviously its not gunna happen but to not keep an open mind is dumb too"
lakers,3di1ir,Entei11,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:27:49 2015 UTC,"If Lawson were to get waived, I'd definitely wouldn't mind him coming to the Lakers. Give him a cheap 2 yr deal w/ perhaps a TO attached to it. Accountability will be much higher in our organization and he would have to remain focused and play hard or your ass will be on the bench. It would also give Russell some time to develop and not feel as pressured although pressure doesn't seem to effect him as much as your typical rookie."
lakers,3di1ir,spudwinkle,0,Thu Jul 16 23:04:55 2015 UTC,"The front office will always listen to trade ideas. Russell and Randle are not off-limits, and obviously we would trade them for a player of Cousins' caliber. But that kind of deal won't happen.   So really, the OP is asking if we'd be willing to jettison our two biggest prospects right now in exchange for some mid-tier talent. That's a bad idea. Mid-tier talent is always available, promising rookies are not. Russell and Randle are on incredibly affordable deals and the Lakers will be able to keep them under contract for much longer due to their rookie contracts. Giving up on them after they've played a combined total of 13 NBA minutes for some random mid-tier talent is a terrible idea."

lakers,3d9box,omgkezia,16,Tue Jul 14 19:13:51 2015 UTC,"It's summer league, who gives a flying fuck? The point is to get some glimmer of where these kids are going, and for better or worse, as the 2nd pick of this year's draft, he NEEDS to keep playing.  Seriously, this is what, there 3rd game together? This is without Kobe, Lou, Bass, Hibbert, these guys should get chemistry going.   Are you looking at the game tape or at the numbers? 8 TOs says sloppy, but look at where they're coming, some of them are just a young guy not handling the ball correctly, others are him trying to find teammates, and those won't be turnovers after they get used to playing with each other."
lakers,3d9box,Rebel908,10,Tue Jul 14 19:19:47 2015 UTC,"I agree. Who cares if Russell makes a more mistakes -- he'll learn from them, rather than sitting on the pine.  Let him make more turn overs and figure things out on the court, not while sitting on the bench. That's what the Summer League is for -- to develop your young talent. Madsen was trying to win the game, but why? Madsen said afterward he was going with the ""hot hands"" in the 4th quarter so that's why he benched Russell, but does someone like Jabari Brown (who I like) who has a lot of actual playing time in the NBA need to be in crunch time in the 4th quarter of an SL game over Russell, your #2 pick and potential franchise player, who has yet to play a real NBA game?   As another NBA exec said on Mason and Ireland show on the radio, the SL is one of the few times you can get your rookies to have tons of playing time because once training camp starts, they'll have to compete with the vets and camp invitees and training camp only lasts about a week till pre-season games.   I like Madsen, but I think he got too focused on winning in the 2nd half. Upshaw should have gotten more than six minutes, even if he wasn't playing well, too."
lakers,3d9box,UltraFlyingTurtle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:47 2015 UTC,maybe Madsen is using that as motivation. This guys are probably highly competitive and I doubt many have been sat because of performance in a while. Could be a way to motivate them to elevate their game
lakers,3d9box,blanknames,3,Wed Jul 15 17:34:01 2015 UTC,I'm just being honest but mark madsen is a horrible fucking coach. 90% of good coaching is about in game adjustments and being able to read the floor and the game.

People thought it was funny and it caught on quickly.  I love Vlad Rad though. He was a good three point shooter when he was wide open and could occasionally get hot and nail them off the dribble or with people in his face. I really enjoyed his odd yet effective rainbow arcs he put on his shots. You could usually tell if they were going in or not about halfway through the arc. He did struggle on defense at times but the spacing and 3pt threat he provided on offense usually negated the lack of D.  EDIT: Yep, it was Phil. See his wikipedia and scroll down to the Lakers section. ""Jackson has also called Vladimir a ""space cadet"" and ""my favorite Martian"" in reference to his being out of position and taking wild three point shots."""

Farmar: Athletic point guard who can play the passing lanes on defense decently. Can slash and finish (One of the few point guards who would dunk repeatedly), could shot forty percent from three and when you're on the break he'll get the ball to a finisher or shooter with ease.  Vujacic: Shooting guard with the ball handling and court awareness of a point guard. A sniper from three who could shoot forty percent. An irritant on defense, perfect at annoying and getting into the heads of players on the other team and getting technicals.  Ariza: Athletic small forward. Excellent at playing the passing lanes and great man to man defense in regards to keep pace with his assignments. Will catch you sleeping on the ball and will strip you with ease. Very fast and has hops, will finish anything you give him on the break. Always moving on offense so he'll either get a great cut to the basket for the assisted layup/dunk or get an offensive rebound to put back or pass out. As we saw in the playoffs that year, can shoot forty percent from three as well.  Odom: Man oh man, the power forward who can do it all. Can handle the ball like a guard, great awareness and passing skills, could shoot the three from up to forty percent, could finish, a rebounding machine on both sides of the court, could finish strong and great defensively, especially in switching and help defense. The biggest part of all I would say was his communication. You could always hear LO shouting instructions on defense and would orchestrate the offense. Absolutely beautiful to watch.  Pau: Pau was always better at running with this bunch than Bynum. Seven feet tall, beautiful post offense with so many moves he'll make your head spin. Excellent court awareness and passing ability from the post, heck even at times LEAD the break himself. Great help defender whose length gave every team in the league problems.  And they all were selfless on offense and on defense. The help, the communication of everyone, the sharing of the ball. THAT ladies and gentlemen, is true Lakers basketball.  This bench was beautiful. When this bench came in, teams knew their team was in trouble. Was simply beautiful to watch."

lakers,3d9ea0,generalizationz,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:58:39 2015 UTC,"Man that was an awesome time for the Lakers. It reminds me why Pau started getting criticized so much, he moved away from being a dominant post player to standing around on the outside settling for mid range shots and 3 pointers. I'm sure a lot of that had to do with D'Antoni not knowing how to utilize him properly but he could've made more of an effort to get back to what he was great at. He stopped being a force on the offense and defense in the post which is why he received so much criticism from the fans. I'm glad he's doing well for the Bulls but you can see that he went back more to his proper role that he used to play for the Lakers."
lakers,3d9ea0,WOX_69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:13:42 2015 UTC,"It was Brown and D'Antoni. I remember I met Brown in late 2011 at the NBA 2K11 Launch event with Magic (Got his autograph and Jerry West's autograph on my copy of NBA 2K12.). I remember he had said in an interview that he'd be using a double post offense akin to the Spurs with Duncan and Robinson. I asked him specifically what type, double low, double high, high-low, which variant. He told me ""High Corner"" double post offense. That right there was the beginning.  If you guessed it, it was Pau the center post in the corner at times. Brown had him shooting threes. With him gone and D'Antoni it in just got worse. Add that with trying to bring Pau off the bench and other nonsense like that and I'm not surprised he left. That, along with Pau's injuries during that time lead to his declining performance."

We had two big comebacks against the Spurs this series.  Looking back, damn what a great series. I figured when we won, whether we played Boston or Detroit, we'd have their number because we just took out the defending champions and third best defensive team in the league in the brutal, brutal West that year. That Finals, (Sans Game 6) was actually much closer than most people give credit for. Also a lot of myths were made from that series. (Look at Pau's numbers from the series. Not enough we needed to win obviously, but still relatively good. Heck, look at Garnett's overall numbers for the series. The big thing between 2008 and 2010 was rebounding and help defense from Pau. Garnett had a poor shooting performance in 2008 and a better one in 2010.)"

Unfortunately, there wasn't that kind of pg in the draft this year :("
lakers,3db6c2,ss3happy1,2,Wed Jul 15 00:56:02 2015 UTC,But on the flip side there were a lot of fantastic players in the previous draft. That's the only reason a guy like Randle fell to us at 7.  Those are the breaks. But I'd rather have Randle/Russell (7/2) than Parker/Mudiay (2/7)over the next five years.
lakers,3db6c2,amarstan,12,Wed Jul 15 01:09:38 2015 UTC,"That's craziness.  Of the 4 guy on that list, Jabari Parker is the only guaranteed franchise player.   I'd trade Russell and Randle for Jabari right now.  Milwaukee would tell us to fuck off."

Parker vs Randle, mmm that's debatable, especially for us - in need of a SF who can stretch into the PF. Parker seems like a franchise player, Randle, as Mitch has pointed out, is more of a Lamar odom type of player. He will probably be our number 2 option after clarkson for the foreseeable future."

lakers,3db6c2,PaperDesk,2,Wed Jul 15 01:31:04 2015 UTC,"I'm actually surprised by how low the number of busts are on that list. Here's the number 1 in every other position in that span   C - Darko, Bogut, Andrea Bargnani, Oden, Brook Lopez, Hasheem Thabeet, Cousins, Kanter, Andre Drummond, Cody Zeller  PF - Melo, Kris Humphries, Marvin Williams, LMA, Al Horford, Kevin Love, Blake Griffin, Derrick Favors, Tristan Thompson, AD, Anthony Bennett  SF - Lebron, Deng, Martell Webster, Adam Morrison, Durant, Michael Beasley, Earl Clark, Evan Turner, Kawhi Leonard, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, Otto Porter  SG - Wade, Ben Gordon, Rashad McCants, Brandon Roy, Corey Brewer, OJ Mayo, Tyreke Evans, Paul George, Jimmer Fredette, Bradley Beal, Ben McLemore  The point guard position definitely looks the least likely to have a bust at the top pick. Power forward is an impressive list, even the busts are solid role players. Center/SG/SF is mostly a disaster with some diamonds."

lakers,3db6c2,acdbx,0,Wed Jul 15 03:03:29 2015 UTC,"It's inaccurate to say Kobe had 2 crappy years. Year 1 his minutes were limited, but he wasn't bad for a #13 pick especially out of high school. He showed a lot of promise already too. Year 2 he became a legitimate starting quality player.   I know it's sacrilegious to talk bad about any point in Kobe's career on the Lakers subreddit. I'm the biggest Kobe homer in the world, and I admit that Kobe showed flashes of promise in his first 2 years just like Dangelo is showing flashes of promise in summer league.   But I am trying to make the comparison that Kobe needed to do badly in order to motivate himself to work harder. I read a story about how Kobe was so traumatized by his 4 airballs against the Jazz in the 97 finals that he shots tens of thousands of shots from each of those spots during the summer. It's okay to fail but I hope Russell learns from those failures like Kobe did.  Edit: this is the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSe80qSgXVA"
lakers,3db6c2,huskysagehen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:39:06 2015 UTC,"Kobe' ""crappy years"" had more to do with the NBA not thinking a teenager could play with them. He played limited minutes. I believe in his second game (it may have been first game of second season though) against Jordan he put 22 or something like that on him. Kobe could play NBA basketball at a high level when he was a rookie. He wasn't allowed because that was a new thing at the time and he ended up on a pretty competitive team"
lakers,3db6c2,FreshDiamond,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:59:58 2015 UTC,"Like you said, he had great games, but they were interspersed with average games, so I'd say on the whole, it was an okay season. He ended up averaging 7.6 points--much less than other high schoolers like KG and Lebron but also on par with other wing players like T-Mac. Hopefully Mr Russell can make the most of his opportunity but I hope that if he does have bad games, he is motivated to improve his game."
lakers,3db6c2,huskysagehen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:01:56 2015 UTC,"My point is he didn't struggle, he was held back. Did he improve? Duh, of course he wasn't as good in his rookie season as he was in year 3."

lakers,3db6c2,huskysagehen,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:50:06 2015 UTC,Lol if your entire basis for this argument is that he took a few bad shots in a playoff game ok.
lakers,3db6c2,FreshDiamond,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:52:55 2015 UTC,No but I am giving a specific example of the lower quality of his first season compared to later seasons: you can measure it by his lower pts per 36 minutes or his lower field goal %.

Like I've said in the past, too, Young provides good levity to Kobe's harshness. That's probably good for the rookies.  I just hope he doesn't check out mid season again like this past year."
lakers,3d98ct,dendenmoooshi,10,Tue Jul 14 15:30:49 2015 UTC,Didn't he have a few injury issues that could explain his 'checking out'?
lakers,3d98ct,ape_cage,11,Tue Jul 14 16:18:25 2015 UTC,"I would also bet that the abysmal record contributed to it. Regardless, he wasn't the same Nick Young we saw his first season here. That year, he was fun. He was pretty underrated, especially on the defensive end. You can tell he really wanted to be a Laker. I hope he gets back to it."
lakers,3d98ct,dendenmoooshi,3,Tue Jul 14 16:43:47 2015 UTC,Because he wasn't in a contract year last season
lakers,3d98ct,CalmerThanYouAreDood,5,Tue Jul 14 17:27:38 2015 UTC,And yet he took a massive pay cut to stay with the Lakers. I don't know if that really holds for Swaggy.
lakers,3d98ct,rheeddiddi,2,Tue Jul 14 19:25:55 2015 UTC,According to whom?  Him?  Please.  Nobody was going to give Nick Young more than we gave him last season.  He's been a career headcase.  That's why he came to the Lakers on a 1-year vet minimum contract.  We were the only one stupid enough to commit to him long term at those dollars.
lakers,3d98ct,StealthRUs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:56:10 2015 UTC,"I concur. They tried dealing him this summer and got no takers. At this point, the FO will gladly trade him for a bag of chips."
lakers,3d98ct,der3zzed,2,Thu Jul 16 00:54:42 2015 UTC,I'm just worried having lou + nick young will mean less minutes or chances to handle the ball for russ and clarkson
lakers,3d98ct,KobeBryantReeves,16,Tue Jul 14 16:21:28 2015 UTC,"That's because there is no market for him despite his ""good"" contract.  He was injured last year, shot terribly and clashed with the coach, what team would want him?  Even though we are thin at Sf he's pretty redundant because he doesn't play D and we now have another volume bench scorer in Lou.  Our best hope is that he rebounds on the court this year and someone either wants him at the deadline or next offseason."
lakers,3d98ct,_im_on_acid_,6,Tue Jul 14 14:56:06 2015 UTC,"His contract isn't great, 3 years(!) $15 Mil for a bench player who doesn't pass, play defense or rebound. However, I'm in the minority of people who thinks Lou and Nick will be the key to our success if we are to have any. As evidenced by 3 of our starters in Summer League, we have a huge problem putting the ball in the basket."
lakers,3d98ct,clnsdabst,6,Tue Jul 14 16:13:45 2015 UTC,"It'll be interesting, we have 3 ball stoppers in Kobe, Lou and Swaggy.  It could really be feast or famine depending if the shots are falling."
lakers,3d98ct,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:28:55 2015 UTC,After our 3 summer league games I'm not impressed with Clarkson or Randle's ability to pass either. Clarkson only has 4 assists in 100 minutes of Summer League action. Meanwhile Russell has 20 TOs in 80 min.
lakers,3d98ct,clnsdabst,3,Tue Jul 14 16:34:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Clarkson really is better as a scoring 2-guard. Russell is turning it over a lot because he is looking to pass a lot. He is going to have a rough rookie season with a lot of turnovers, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have the ability to pass. We'll have a better idea towards the end of the season when he gets more used to both his teammates tendencies and the quicker, bigger defenders that cover up those lanes recover so much better than he was used to in college."
lakers,3d98ct,Lightning14,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:41:03 2015 UTC,I think Rick Pitino comparing his passing to Magic Johnson didn't help my already high expectations of D'angelo. Hopefully once his shot starts dropping his passing will improve as well.
lakers,3d98ct,clnsdabst,2,Tue Jul 14 17:54:14 2015 UTC,"Look at how far Clarkson has come though after a season, his offensive moves looked like garbage during last years preseason and a few weeks of the regular season.  It was awful, but you can see how far he has already come since then!    I know we Laker fans are not known for our patience, but we need to have it for the next year.  We aren't winning a title this year."
lakers,3d98ct,KovonMolebock,-1,Tue Jul 14 17:31:43 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong I'm high on Clarkson, he was putting up ~17 ppg the last 2 months of last season, that's no simple task. He's clearly the best player on the Summer League team, but 1 assist every 25 minutes for someone who made 38 starts as an NBA point guard is a miserable return."
lakers,3d98ct,clnsdabst,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:49:15 2015 UTC,I'm hoping Russell just becomes a pure point guard. The passes I saw from him (when not a turnover) were a thing of beauty
lakers,3d98ct,ashishvp,9,Wed Jul 15 01:41:27 2015 UTC,"So our SF rotation will be Kobe Bryant and Nick Young?  That's fine, everything is fine."
lakers,3d98ct,Trontaun79,14,Tue Jul 14 15:08:12 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Anthony "" Steal of the Draft""  Brown."
lakers,3d98ct,amarstan,3,Tue Jul 14 15:20:00 2015 UTC,"He's probably going to be our main SF. Nick Young can't guard anybody, and Kobe's age and his new thin body will make him a target to exploit. No way either of them can match up defensively against young legs and a wide frame. Anthony Brown is our only hope!"
lakers,3d98ct,ss3happy1,2,Tue Jul 14 19:46:31 2015 UTC,I see your point on Kobe. But if the league is going toward 3 and D guys this logic doesn't hold up. Thinner Kobe will actually do better against 3 and D guys.
lakers,3d98ct,swookilla,-5,Wed Jul 15 06:04:02 2015 UTC,We still have Ryan Kelly as well.
lakers,3d98ct,nluna1975,10,Tue Jul 14 15:33:18 2015 UTC,Not a sf..

lakers,3d98ct,StealthRUs,6,Tue Jul 14 15:38:32 2015 UTC,Throw in 2nd round pick and a European player that will never come over and I think I could convince him
lakers,3d98ct,335strat,9,Tue Jul 14 15:39:49 2015 UTC,"GET HINKIE AND MITCH ON THE PHONE RIGHT FUCKING NOW, THIS IS WONDERFUL."
lakers,3d98ct,WOX_69,3,Tue Jul 14 17:28:49 2015 UTC,Lol. That would be a historically bad trade for the Sixers. Hinkie wouldn't do that without a gun to his head.

lakers,3d98ct,BABYPUBESS,2,Tue Jul 14 14:20:34 2015 UTC,Who were candidates to fill a defense-minded role for us?  Swaggy's defense is passable when he's locked in.
lakers,3d98ct,peaches017,3,Tue Jul 14 15:06:06 2015 UTC,"When he's locked in   The problem is he's often not locked in. I like Mbah a moute, I thought he could have gave us 20 minutes or so of solid D. Sounds like Kings might get him though. I think Demarre Carrol and Dorell Wright would have been good fits too."
lakers,3d98ct,BABYPUBESS,2,Tue Jul 14 15:13:56 2015 UTC,I feel like the lakers should make a run for Luc Richard Mbah a Moute. He's more of a defensive minded wing and he's not a highly coveted free agent... Probably can get him for decently cheap.

lakers,3d98ct,GeraldShopao,2,Tue Jul 14 16:22:39 2015 UTC,"Hopefully he focuses a bit more and gets a bit more active on the defensive end like Byron said.

I believe we'll be able to move him at some point. He won't be on this team by the end of the year."

Not our fault stern ducked us over which cost us a setback. Out fault tho, and I blame Jim and Mitch for not trading dwight and gasol. I mean everyone knew dwight wasn't happy and he was gone. Trade him for something at least... Gasol was betrayed with the constant trade rumors so clearly he left and wanted to compete... Trade him for some asserts. Oh well.

lakers,3dbg7p,FuriousFlex,2,Wed Jul 15 04:13:35 2015 UTC,"I agree, the problem isn't in the player moves we've made. It was only three years ago that Jim Buss had overseen the creation of what as supposed to be the NBA's next superteam (Dwight/Nash/Pau/Kobe/MWP), on the heels of essentially trading for CP3 a few months before that.  The problem has been Jim and Mitch's choices of coaching. Byron Scott's horribleness has been somewhat excused since we were in a tanking situation, but we need a REAL coach next year. Hopefully Thibs or Rick Carlisle is available next year."

lakers,3dacnn,ChrisKamanMyEye,31,Tue Jul 14 19:03:45 2015 UTC,If he plays well and improves even more this season he'll earn a decent contract. I'd imagine the Lakers would match any offer he receives.
lakers,3dacnn,sgad88,24,Tue Jul 14 19:09:34 2015 UTC,"someone correct me if I'm wrong but I heard Clarkson falls under the Arenas rule, being a 2nd round pick which means he can't earn more than MLE for the first 2 years of his new contract. This means someone can sign him to contract like Houston signed Lin where he was earning 5 mil, 5 mil,  then 15 million the 3rd year."
lakers,3dacnn,LASteady,8,Tue Jul 14 19:47:03 2015 UTC,"That is the best news I've heard all week. I was paranoid that any one of the 29 other teams would offer him a max to spite us, and we'd lose Clarkson to a competitor. I'm all for the 2 year MLE + poison pill contract."
lakers,3dacnn,bul1dog,3,Tue Jul 14 21:53:56 2015 UTC,"Curious, why would you poison pill a contract for your own player? Isn't the purpose of the poison pill is to detract the team with the rights (Lakers) from signing him?"
lakers,3dacnn,Rimmmer93,6,Wed Jul 15 00:48:42 2015 UTC,"HOU did it so that they could get Jlin on the cheap for those 2 years with the full intention of moving him in the 3rd. But you're right that ideally we wouldn't be looking to move him in that 3rd year, so maybe there would be no point?   From Jordan's standpoint, I hope he gets upwards of $15M in the 3rd year. Dude needs to get paid at some point. Right now he's on that Bob Sacre salary."
lakers,3dacnn,bul1dog,4,Wed Jul 15 01:04:43 2015 UTC,HOU poison pilled the contract to put NY deep in the luxury tax for year 3 so they wouldn't match.  Same with Chicago for Asik.    But Morey didn't know he was gonna move either of them at the time.
lakers,3dacnn,Liquorpuki,2,Wed Jul 15 01:15:51 2015 UTC,"Oh that's right, forgot HOU used it to pull him away from NY. I am shame."
lakers,3dacnn,bul1dog,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:19:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if the full intention was moving him the third year initially. He was coming off a the whole linsanity BS and looked good.  They had to toss in a first rounder to move him, so I would say it's more of a risk to offer him big money more than anything"
lakers,3dacnn,Rimmmer93,2,Wed Jul 15 02:07:09 2015 UTC,This is correct.
lakers,3dacnn,MrDaveyHavoc,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:18:37 2015 UTC,"IIRC the poison pill type contract for the team that actually intends to keep the player pays those exact figures whereas the team absorbing pays the average salary.   We can pay Jordan more than the MLE as long as we have the cap space to do so. So if we strike out in FA. We'd be able to offer him a 4 year deal that's fair (with the new cap something like 8-9M). If you look at Lin and Asik, the PP contract hasn't really helped them. They've been in trade talks their entire time, and haven't signed great deals since. JC probably won't have to get some crazy contract to be satisfied."
lakers,3dacnn,rebeltrillionaire,17,Wed Jul 15 09:31:27 2015 UTC,lol brilliant username
lakers,3dacnn,bul1dog,12,Tue Jul 14 19:09:14 2015 UTC,Mitch is gonna extend him before the offseason so I wouldn't worry about it.
lakers,3dacnn,supermaor23,9,Tue Jul 14 19:11:59 2015 UTC,That is probably not going to happen.  As a restricted free agent his cap hold is barely $1mil against next years cap.  Even though we'll have enough space for 2 max players next summer there is no reason to commit actual money against our cap to him now unless he signs long term significantly below his value.
lakers,3dacnn,_im_on_acid_,4,Tue Jul 14 19:30:04 2015 UTC,"Spot on. Similar to what the spurs did with Kawhi, the lakers can use up all their cap space on free agents with clarkson only taking up 1mil or so, and then they can go over the cap to give him wvtr he wants"
lakers,3dacnn,njain4,3,Tue Jul 14 20:32:11 2015 UTC,"Not really sure how it works, but I think a player must play more than 2 seasons with a team in order to re-sign a player during the regular season. Since JC is on a 2 year contract, he's gonna end up on the market next year as a RFA. Hopefully, the Lakers match any offer he receives."

lakers,3dacnn,LikeIFuckingCare,3,Tue Jul 14 19:36:10 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say he's overhyped, nobody has been saying he'll be a top 5 PG or anything. I've maintained my hope that he becomes our Mike Conley, a great 2 way guy."
lakers,3dacnn,TuneHD,3,Tue Jul 14 23:26:57 2015 UTC,I don't necessarily expect him to be bonafide stud or anything but if he was drafted 15th people would feel a lot different about him. I actually think a lot of people are low on him
lakers,3dacnn,FreshDiamond,2,Wed Jul 15 03:18:48 2015 UTC,"I imagine someone will throw a fairly big offer at him if he keeps developing as he has been, just because LA will likely be loathe to match early on in free agency given our desire to use the cap space we'll have opening up to land some big fish in the off season. Likely somewhere in the region of 4yr/30mil give or take 15 mill"
lakers,3dacnn,Ksanti,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:43:04 2015 UTC,"He cant get more than a midlevel contract for the next 2 years, then in the 3rd and beyond he can get up the max for a player with less than 6 years of service which is 25% of the cap."
lakers,3dacnn,rtrainer30,0,Wed Jul 15 20:38:42 2015 UTC,"depends on how well he does this season. i bet we're looking at a 4yr/60M contract or something along those lines. I think he'll be a 15/5 guy this season. Won't be dominating the ball nearly as much with Kobe/Lou/Young on the floor at different times. But he'll certainly get this shot early in the season if he takes majority of point guard duties while Russell comes off the bench. Could be problematic if another team forces their hand with a max offer. With extra cap space, some teams might just go for it."
lakers,3dacnn,unix04,2,Tue Jul 14 20:33:10 2015 UTC,He's not eligible for that much. He's going to get a Lin/Asik type deal.

lakers,3de3z5,OctagonNorther,10,Wed Jul 15 15:38:53 2015 UTC,"D'Angelo and Hibbert.   I still think Russell was the right choice, because Okafor and Randle would be a defensive disaster. Absolutely no rim protection and they'd get cooked night in and night out in the NBA. Also, while Okafor has shown the pretty nice moves he has, he evidently stills struggles vs length (blocked three times by Porzingis last night) and he doesn't convert at the line. How is Okafor going to fare vs NBA bigs and length like DeAndre/Gobert/Drummond/Bogut/Hibbert/Whiteside/Howard etc? So I still think Russell is the right guy, because Okafor and Randle together...wouldn't work."
lakers,3de3z5,Holajuwon34,2,Wed Jul 15 16:00:51 2015 UTC,"Good points, and I'd have picked D'Angelo and Hibbert for the same reasons.  What if Lakers, for whatever reason, Lakers had picked Porzingas. Do you think Randle and Porzingas would have worked out?  While still a project and not as NBA-ready as Okafor, Porzingas is mobile, and can stretch the floor with his shooting range, and his 7'3"" length bothers shots (as we've seen him blocking Okafor in the SL). The polar opposite of Okafor.   It would be interesting to think about. Your thoughts?"
lakers,3de3z5,UltraFlyingTurtle,2,Wed Jul 15 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have minded Porzingis at all. He seriously has a great chance at being the best player in this draft, the upside on this kid is insane. His skillset is more alike to Towns, who most would agree also would've worked with Randle on both ends due to the fact both (KAT & Porzingis) can stretch for floor, can rim protect, and are athletic and mobile too which is a nice bonus. Yes, of course he's not NBA ready like Okafor due to his frame, but neither was Kobe Bryant for that matter.   An additional bonus is that he can play PF & C (also like Towns). That's a bonus to me because I don't think Randle will be our long term answer at PF. (I've always felt this way, more or less after he was drafted, although I hope he proves me seriously wrong). However if Randle doesn't work out like we hope, it gives us the option of slotting Porzingis there instead of Randle and finding another center instead, meaning Porzingis can be our long term PF as well as center. While people have stated their (premature) regrets about the fact we passed on Okafor or even Mudiay, to me if there's anyone I also wished we could've chosen...its Porzingis."
lakers,3de3z5,Holajuwon34,2,Wed Jul 15 21:21:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yeah, a lot of people (including me) seem to have overlooked Porzingas. I wonder if Lakers would have picked him if they had the 4th pick.  Pretty amazing how this year's draft had so many quality big men."
lakers,3de3z5,UltraFlyingTurtle,2,Wed Jul 15 22:03:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's an interesting to think what we'd have done if we didn't jump to 2nd and stayed at 4th. I like to think we'd have gone Porzingis, but we'll never know."
lakers,3de3z5,Holajuwon34,3,Wed Jul 15 22:23:19 2015 UTC,I'll tell you in a year
lakers,3de3z5,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Wed Jul 15 17:25:25 2015 UTC,Russell was the right choice. We always knew Okafor was more NBA-ready. Of course he's going to perform better in SL. Russell has the tools to be an elite PG.    So I'll take the top overall talent (Russell) no matter what. Russell and Hibbert it is.
lakers,3de3z5,NotLouisMalle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:41:10 2015 UTC,"D/Angelo and Hibbert.  I agree with the people feeling lackadaisical after not picking Porzingis though, I was very high on Porzingis before the draft as I saw a mental toughness in him I liked. Talk about people have a slight, and something to prove. Porzingis is out to defend the right of every Euro big who was ever called soft, just ask Okafor about those three blocks and seven fouls. ( I know fouls aren't good but just shows his toughness and aggressiveness). The drive and kick/ pick and pop ability of a clarkson and porzingis pairing would have been immense and Randle has showed the ability to be interchangeable between 3/4 while Porzingis (assuming he adds muscle like he's saying he will) will eventually be able to go 4/5 (STRETCH 5).  The fact he went to the knicks makes me hate that we jumped up in draft order. Porzingis wanted the Lakers, wanted the spotlight squarely on him to prove the world wrong about his bust status. He has my attention anyways.  P.S not a bandwagon follower, there's a post from me before the draft stating my want for Porzingis, Kid straight has talent,  P.P.S. No disrespect to Russell, he looks like the next Steve Nash (and with Nash actually giving the kid pointers…… you see my point) Just actually THAT big on the Latvian."

lakers,3dcg08,wanderfound,11,Wed Jul 15 05:03:38 2015 UTC,"The Warriors, Spurs and Atlanta Hawks run variations of the Spurs motion offense, since Steve Kerr played for Popovich and Hawks coach, Mike Budenholzer, was assistant coach for Popovich.  Both Steve Kerr and Budenholzer, of course, have modified it in different ways, and run other sets as well, like the ever popular Horns set, but all three teams at their core, employ a read-and-react offense. Both coaches embrace analytics -- Budenholzer was Popovich's analytics guy, Kerr speaks at the Sloan Sports analytics conference, and uses analytics and sports technology in interesting ways, like to monitor the health and physical effectiveness of his players. They both are cutting-edge coaches.  Kerr will be especially interesting to watch next year as he said despite winning a championship, he didn't get a chance to employ everything he wanted, so things will get tweaked even more.

Add a few talented rookies to the mix and I feel this season will surprise most of us.

Worst case scenario is his coaching wasn't bad just to tank but is actually just bad and he continues with throwing players under the bus in media causing the young players to lose confidence. Probably will end up somewhere in between, but I definitely think we should be looking at other options if possible, and let him have his chance in the meantime."
lakers,3dadg6,blacKCastle32,12,Tue Jul 14 23:02:28 2015 UTC,"He is a hardhead who is stuck in his old ways while most other up and coming teams have coaches that adapt well. FO, I think, will give him 2 years to prove himself. If the team is not headed in the right direction, I think he will be gone after next season and the one after.  He's good at getting guys to play hard, but when it comes to strategy.. he's horrible."
lakers,3dadg6,misterrunon,3,Tue Jul 14 19:36:06 2015 UTC,"The thing is Byron is a developmental coach, so there's a reason he's a hardhead. He teaches young guys who are new to the league how to be a professional. He's not an offensive mastermind by any stretch, but he is good a developing young teams and that's exactly what he's here to do."

lakers,3dadg6,inspector_baj3t,15,Tue Jul 14 19:33:29 2015 UTC,"Been to the finals twice for a reason. He's no pop, but he's a good coach. He's great at developing players, and he genuinely cares about this franchise. That's why he didn't mind taking over when it was in such terrible shape. He took the hit because he loves the lakers. I'm very happy to have him and I'm glad we picked him rather than idiots like Karl"
lakers,3dadg6,Kbmakaveli,12,Tue Jul 14 19:26:00 2015 UTC,"I think he was a good coach 10 years ago but in today's nba not so much. He was quoted last year saying that he doesn't believe the three point shot is that important. He's anti analytics and will most likely never lead the Lakers to the finals. However, I do believe he will be a good coach to help develop our young guys so I don't mind having him for the next couple seasons."
lakers,3dadg6,BABYPUBESS,11,Tue Jul 14 19:37:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Scott was good 10 years ago but the game is evolving.  We can do better and I don't like that we have hitched a ride on the NBA coaching carousel after Phil left with Brown, D'Antoni, and now Scott.  There are good coaches out there that just need a shot.  Vogel was an assistant, Budenholzer, Hornacek, etc...  We should either be going for a top tier known quantity like Thibbs or groom an up-and-comer with our young core."

lakers,3dadg6,FreshDiamond,0,Tue Jul 14 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"This is fair but conversely look at the Houston Rockets. They put so much stock into the math of it all that they put there players in a position to fail. They encourage players like josh smith and Corey brewer to shoot threes. These guys are bad shooters. I don't believe 3s are as important as many do but I can clearly see it is a more valuable attempt. 3s and lay ups make you predictable and easy to defend. The Dallas mavs were an offensive juggernaut before the rondo trade. They did it with a guy who shoots from any and everywhere monta Ellis, a guy who operates almost exclusively from high post dirk. Those are two point jump shots. Chandler parsons and tyson chandler. There is no exact formula. The golden state warriors did not win because they buy into playing fast and shooting 3s. They won because that system fit their roster best AND THEY WERE AN ELITE DEFENSIVE TEAM. If another shaq and Kobe come around and another Phil wants to run the triangle that will work too."

You wanna see how a good coach develops a crappy team, look at Quin Synder.    After Vaughn got fired last year, it was basically Wittman and Scott for the 2 worst coaches in the league.  Now that Wittman showed in the playoffs he has some clue what he's doing, rock bottom = Scott, crossing his arms bragging about how old school he is and blaming his players for losing games where they're not allowed to shoot 3's or foul down 3 with 30 seconds left."

In fact, MDA's western conference appearances are superior to Scott's eastern conference Finals appearances. And with Russell, MDA would have been perfect. But you all ruined that.    Also...where did we rank in defense last couple seasons? Since apparently Scott teaches defense.  But he's our coach and we'll just have to deal with it.   On the flip side...because MDA>Scott, we may have never got Russell."

lakers,3dadg6,BionicSix,3,Tue Jul 14 19:33:55 2015 UTC,"Well even with injuries, he should have at least established some identity on offense at least. We are going into this season once again unfamiliar with the offense."

lakers,3da3pj,ape_cage,3,Tue Jul 14 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"Some of this blame falls on the Lakers for over hyping these players.   All we heard this summer from them is how great Randle has looked....and he's played like shit thus far in Summer League.   Then they tell us how special Russell was in his workouts....and he's been a turnover machine lacking quickness and athleticism.  Oh and let's not forget last summer when reports were that Kobe was dominating and looked great....which was total BS. He looked older and slower than ever putting up Allen Iverson type shooting percentages.  IF Okafor turns out to be better than Russell and if Randle doesn't materialize into the type of player everyone thought he would be coming out of Kentucky,  then Mitch and Jimbo better have their bags packed.   Personally I've had enough of losing dammit! We are the Lakers,  the crown jewel of the NBA."
lakers,3da3pj,p0se1d0n,10,Tue Jul 14 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"either your sarcasm is very subtle or you have no idea...  Let's just address this Okafor bullshit first. He's playing against the guys he was playing in college and big men scrubs that are there to round out teams. Wait till he plays against DAJ. Or bogut. Or dwight. Or old man Tyson chandler. Or Marc gasol (my personal favorite for his demise) he doesn't have any lift or explosion. (This does need to be revisited once he actually does succeed or fail against those guys.)  Randle: of course they were going to say he looked great/strong/explosive. What? You think they're going to say, ""nah bro he sucks can't ball at all"" gtfo.. he is getting his legs and touch back. Oh and you know the double/triple/and sometimes quad defense he is facing in the post from literally everyone on the other team crashing on him.   DLO: he is learning some rules that he isn't used to playing with 24 second and backcourt. Also, some of his TO'S have come from making exceptional passes into brick walls. How many times did tarik black take it to his face or chest. (Yes DLO made some bad turnovers but I am saying the #s are inflated by teammates not being aware.)"
lakers,3da3pj,rjbh,2,Tue Jul 14 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"Bro...Okafor is going to be a solid pro, no doubt about it.   We were sold that Russell is going to be ""superstar"" though. We'll all have to wait and see, but right now i'm not feeling it.   If Russell and Okafor both end up just being 'pretty good starters' - I'd take the pretty good Center any day of the week"
lakers,3da3pj,SwaggyPGOAT,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:55:27 2015 UTC,"Not in this league man. Its 2xs as fast as it was when Shaq was the man. Centers are a usefull position but only when they match the teams needs. Shit look at Hibbert, hes a top 15 center in the league as far as the position goes. Hes huge strong and a sound basketball player, but hes slow for tbe NBA which has turned into a guard dominant league thanks to Kobe 10 years ago. For the forseable future Ill take a good PG (something weve lacked for 15+ years (Fish was not a true PG, he was a damn great player, but he was a fixture that complimented our SG driven team)) over a very good traditional Center any day, every day, all day. Why do you think Oakafor went from being the unquestionable first pick early last season to questionably the second pick for the remainder? Cause he doesnt fit the leagues speed and explosion. He will be good and contribute.....about as well as a Bogut or a Hibbert, and so long as Russel can learn to hit his targets at speed and has a somewhat effective drive, he will be miles more effective than Oakafor."
lakers,3da3pj,Mercury756,2,Tue Jul 14 20:46:40 2015 UTC,Russell doesn't really have speed either.
lakers,3da3pj,Potato_Battery,3,Wed Jul 15 00:53:56 2015 UTC,He sorta reminds me of Kendall Marshall
lakers,3da3pj,streetsweepskeet,0,Wed Jul 15 03:44:31 2015 UTC,"A pass is ten times faster than anyones foot speed and a PG that can learn court vision like he's shown the ability to do at his previous levels, will effectively be a much faster player than any big man sans maybe Pau for much the same reason.   Fucking hell do I miss The Spaniard!  Russel might not be able to beat most of the other PGs at a foot race, but neither could Nash or countless other great players. However thier ability to thread the needle at split second decision timing is what makes them as fast as they need to be. Im not saying that Russel is the savior or the next comming of Magic. Im saying that in todays game the prospect between two players that were both top level in the college game with one being a 5 and the other being a PG going in blind (as far as the teams needs) Im taking the guard; add to this what we (the LAL) are very much lacking and im taking a guard thats even noticeably worse than a traditional 5 so long as he has NBA caliber abilities. I think if it was between KAT and Russel theres good reason to go with Towns he has more of a game that seems to blend well with a transitional big man a la Aldridge or David Lee, it stands to be seen if he has said abilities yet but Im definitely more willing (if Im the front office) to pass on a real PG for someone like that considering along with how quick and sped up the game is now a dominating combo F/C is the games new dominating big man and can very easily change a franchise dramatically if he just exceeds expectation by a little; take Anthony Davis for example. So to make a short story long Oakafor will be a good maybe even great center but will have a very poor chance at lifting a franchise out of the gutter because hes last decades style of center, hes very much going to be imo comprable to Hibbert. Whereas Russel has the potential to be a franchise savior if he exceeds expectation, or potentially a full on game changer for us if he simply meets expectations, and thats worth the small gamble of him maybe being a bust (but I really doubt that will happen.)"
lakers,3da3pj,Mercury756,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:01:24 2015 UTC,"Okafor is not only a good passer out of the post...but his post moves are already so much better than Bogut and he's light years ahead of Hibbert.   The only problem Okafor has had so far is going up against superior length. However, if the league is going to play more small ball, Okafor could potentially feast on the Julius Randles of the world guarding him"

It would also show that we don't have any confidence in Russell which is not something you should do to the #2 pick.

While he may be able to bully-ball SF's in this league, he doesn't have the ability to actively defend them, at least not from what I've seen. I've always found him to be a true PF. I can't really see him playing any effective minutes at the 3, and I could never see him being able to defend the 5 unless our opponent was running small ball as well.   His skill set is more rare for a PF than a SF as well, with his ball handling and passing abilities. I think he'd be way more effective at the 4."
lakers,3ddr78,ape_cage,7,Wed Jul 15 20:31:21 2015 UTC,Byron Scott said himself that Randle is a 4 until proven otherwise. I doubt we'll see him at the 3 very much this season.
lakers,3ddr78,Buckelroo,5,Wed Jul 15 16:03:06 2015 UTC,God no. He's struggling playing his natural position in summer league. Switching his position isn't going to help him find his game any quicker.
lakers,3ddr78,BABYPUBESS,6,Wed Jul 15 15:22:51 2015 UTC,"Only if he shows us that he can hit the mid range shot and the occasional three, which he hasn't yet. I also don't know how well he would guard other SFs"
lakers,3ddr78,TimeisIllmatic95,3,Wed Jul 15 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"He hasn't been shooting jumpers and he has had opportunities to shoot them also. Defenders always give him space because they know he is going to either bully his way to the paint or do that spin move. So answer: no. Kobe should be at the 3. Not the best option, but what can ya do."
lakers,3ddr78,Pacific_Brocean,0,Wed Jul 15 20:50:48 2015 UTC,He can't shoot and he can't pass.
lakers,3ddr78,FreshDiamond,3,Wed Jul 15 17:07:41 2015 UTC,He can't defend 3s and he probably can't beat 3s off the dribble
lakers,3ddr78,toomanypumpfakes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:37:28 2015 UTC,I want to see him more in the low post. I know he's trying to show off his face up game which will be essential against the taller and longer 4s in the league but man use that strength and touch that has been your bread and butter.

lakers,3d77uh,DA40_in_the_rough,30,Tue Jul 14 02:29:27 2015 UTC,"agreed - Kobe is still looking for a decently large payday even after these injuries. It cripples our team, but it's the price we have literally paid to have a hall-of-famer on our team for 20 seasons."
lakers,3d77uh,kbx94,19,Tue Jul 14 02:32:47 2015 UTC,"I agree.  If it's the price to pay for 5 championships over the last 15 years, then I'd gladly take it.  Many teams take decades to win multiple championships.  Their fans literally grow old in between rings.  Can you imagine being 50-60 years old before your team wins another 'ship?  That's why I don't mind if Kobe hetd paid a lot at all."
lakers,3d77uh,deadprezrepresentme,7,Tue Jul 14 02:50:52 2015 UTC,That's not necessarily true. We had the cap to sign a big FA like LA with Kobe's current contract and we didn't manage that. It's a smart business move for him. Look at Dirk who's getting paid way under his value. Mav's FO has failed to surround him with quality talent regardless.   Lakers have been able to add good role players in Williams and Bass and acquire Hibbert with the cap space they've had available.

lakers,3d77uh,Risar,2,Tue Jul 14 10:58:56 2015 UTC,wilt ? Russell? kareem?
lakers,3d77uh,wasweissich,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:17:31 2015 UTC,"Here is the thing, while I respect their abilities and consider them great they had an overwhelming physical advantage for most of their careers, and in the case of Kareem and Russell are only even in consideration for this discussion because of how good their teams were.  Wilt and Shaq would be #1 and #2 if the question was 'most dominant', but if they question is 'best player' then its Magic, Kobe, Jordan. You can debate the order, throw Robertson and Bird on the list etc, but to me when you talk about 'best' you are talking about the most skilled all around player."
lakers,3d77uh,Risar,2,Tue Jul 14 14:08:56 2015 UTC,so you choose just guards because you have no feeling how skilled big mans have to be? kareem with his skyhook making him one of the most efficient scorers there have ever been. wilt with his unstoppable positioning and fade away. russell with perhaps the best understanding of defense ever displayed and being although not the biggest or strongest player perhaps the greatest rebounder the game has ever seen? basketball is not the bigman game it used to be but just because now the focus is more on guards we cannot forget that the nba was dominated for a long time by low post players that had incredible skill in defense and offense.
lakers,3d77uh,wasweissich,0,Tue Jul 14 16:46:09 2015 UTC,"I dont forget it, I was raised during the era of big men.  However the three players you just listed routinely played against guys 6-8 inches shorter than them, in much higher scoring era's of basketball (no zone etc). Watch some of the old reels of Wilt or Kareem in their prime. It was like watching an older brother play against a child. Although they were skilled it was nothing like the three players listed above."
lakers,3d77uh,deadprezrepresentme,0,Tue Jul 14 17:11:53 2015 UTC,"you know that Russell played against wilt ?and hakeem was marginally larger than the average center at his time but not as you make it out not even speaking about his athletics he wasn't a powerhouse like shaq he was just better at his time than any other center. and hell the average center size at wilts time was  6'10"" he was like 3 inches higher he did not tower them like children. he had hard times against bill russell who was you guessed it average sized for a center."
lakers,3d77uh,Risar,-17,Tue Jul 14 19:17:45 2015 UTC,"C'mon now.  I know I'm in the Lakers subreddit, but I can't see Magic and Kobe in the top 3.  I've got Kareem in my top 3, but neither Magic (top 5 though) or Kobe.   MJ Kareem LeBron Wilt Magic/Bird"
lakers,3d77uh,deadprezrepresentme,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:41:38 2015 UTC,"http://zoomtens.com/espn-has-lied-to-you-ten-reasons-michael-jordan-is-not-the-greatest-nba-player-of-all-time/2/  Jordan is overrated. Great yes, but ""GOAT no matter what !"" bullshit. I saw him play in the 80s. The guy was 2x the ballhog Kobe ever was (the biggest, and only 'real' knock on Kobe BTW) and routinely got beat by lesser teams because of it. Secondary to that, the 90's Bulls were a damned good team without Jordan. Best coach ever, another top 25 player, 3 other All Star caliber players and some of the best role players to ever set foot on the hardwood. Does that make Jordan better or worse ? I feel like it greatly exaggerates his position because the Bulls were simply better than everyone else at the time. By a lot.  As for Lebron, are you serious ?! Or just too young too have seen great basketball ? Half the reason anybody even talks about this clown on this level is because they hate Kobe / the Lakers. He's physically dominant sure, but the league is 'small ball' now, weak defense, no interior presence etc. I'd be more inclined to call him GLOAT than GOAT at this point.  I measure players based on who they beat and the quality of their competition, not just how much everyone else rides their jock. Its easy now for a big SF/SG to go low or drive and physically dominate compared to the days of giants.   As for you putting LeBron above Magic ... you must be nuts. Magic effectively averaged 20/10/8 for his career in THE most competitive era of basketball we've ever seen. He routinely beat other players and teams who are considered top 25, HOF etc etc. James hasnt. He was also one of the, if not the most clutch players in big games ever. Sure he didnt have the showy shots of Jordan or Kobe, but he absolutely dominated routinely.   Hell, Kobe also has routinely beat great teams and HOF players, put up killer stats in his prime etc etc. How many ""better than Kobe"" players have we had to endure now ? Iverson, Carter, McGrady, Pierce, Allen etc etc. None of which was true then or now, all of which were perpetuated by Kobe and Laker haters.   Consider this - every argument that people have in favor of Lebron backs Kobe's case as well, and Kobe has more rings and honestly hasnt been straight up outworked or outplayed consistently like Lebron has. Did you watch that Magic series a few years back ?  Lebron essentially has 1 quality championship, against the Spurs in '13. He completely bombed against an above average Magic team in 09, lost twice to the same Spurs (1-2 for those keeping track, where Kobe v the Duncan teams is 4-2) etc etc. The only argument people have with him is raw numbers. Which by that measure its Wilt followed by Wilt followed by (you guessed it) more Wilt. But numbers are not the whole story."
lakers,3d77uh,Risar,0,Tue Jul 14 07:57:10 2015 UTC,"lol.  I knew the Lakers lens would be heavy after I drunkenly posted my top 5...but Jesus man.    I can't even start about your Jordan arguments because they are so off base.  The link you posted is straight up asinine.  Jordan lost in the 80s so he's not the GOAT?  That's why careers aren't judged halfway through.  John Elway was considered a loser and unclutch until late in his career and now he's widely considered one of the greatest QBs of all-time.  And speaking of clutch...I remember hearing about a fellah by the name of Magic Johnson who LITERALLY dribbled out the clock in a Finals game, only to go on to lose the game AND the series.  He also air balled a shot to tie a Game 3 in '81, losing the series to under dogs Houston.    Jordan had a great team behind him?  Guess what...so did EVERY SINGLE PLAYER THAT HAS WON A TITLE.  That's how team sports work, mon frere.  You have to have a great team to win a chip.  Russell, Kareem, Wilt, Jordan, Walton, Bird, Kobe, Shaq, DWade, Duncan, Zeke, etc. etc. etc.  ALL those dudes had ELITE teams behind them.    Now, I'll happily admit that Magic could've easily gone down as the GOAT if his career wasn't cut short.  If he played for 20 years, which he easily could have, he probably would've gone down as the greatest.  But to say that he was playing in the most competitive era in basketball is simply nostalgia.  The current competition in the league is by far the most refined, studied, executed, and most importantly ATHLETIC talent pool the league has ever seen.  There has never been players stronger and more practiced than we are seeing today.  It's literally a lifestyle from grade school on.  Players are analyzed and recruited even before they're in high school now.  They are doing strength training and workouts a literal decade earlier in their lives than any other era.  As for LeBron?  Well, I'll start by saying that LeBron James was heralded as a top 10 talent while he was still in high school AND HE'S LIVED UP TO THE HYPE.  He's actually lived up to, and arguably exceeded, the expectations of being an all-time great since he was 15.  He's, arguably, been the most publicly chastised, analyzed, and critiqued player in the history of the league and he's overcome all of that to win 2 titles and FOUR league MVPs.  Sounds like a pretty even ratio to Kobe's 5 titles and ONE league MVP, yet Kobe dominated in an era that is compared to the 70s as one of the weaker and more diluted talent pools ever.  And Kobe always had one of, if not the best team behind him when he was winning chips (again, not that that matters, but you seem to think it does).  And If you want to talk about a star player playing at an elite level WITHOUT a stud team behind him, you need only to turn to LeBron in 2007.  He drrrrrraaaaaagggggeeeeddddddd one of the weaker rosters in the league to the Finals, pretty much by himself.  He's played in the NBA Finals for the last FIVE years, straight.  In the modern era, that's the equivalent to what Russell and Jones did in the 60s.  Complete and utter dominance of the apex of talent in the history of the league.  Plus, if you were to put him in ANY other era, LeBron would straight up destroy everyone.  He's strong, quick, fast, agile, and he's great at basically every facet of the game.  He's built like a brick shit house yet he runs like a gazelle.  Not to mention, he's improved every single year and continually added new elements to his style.  For all intents and purposes, he's Magic Johnson 2.0.  And don't try to tell me that just because hand checking isn't a thing anymore that LeBron would struggle to get to the rim in any other era.  He's got 2 inches and 40 pounds on Michael and he never had any issues with it.  Also, defenses are harder than ever to score on.  Zone defense wasn't even allowed in the 80s and 90s, your alleged most competitive era.  As I said, this modern era is the most studied and refined period the game has ever seen.  It's the fastest the game has ever been played.  The players can player longer and harder than they ever have been able to.  Anyway, I can't believe I just wasted 20 minutes writing this out..."
lakers,3d77uh,HaLire,2,Tue Jul 14 18:43:22 2015 UTC,"Well, I'll start by saying that LeBron James was heralded as a top 10 talent while he was still in high school AND HE'S LIVED UP TO THE HYPE.   You are on drugs, or on LeBron's man parts. Either way, you are wrong.  The ""most studied"" era of basketball hasnt produced a dominant big man in what, 10 years ? Hasnt produced a real rivalry. Hasnt even produced a consistently great team in 10 years. I don't care about hollinger and his little stat-whores trying to quantify everything, that doesnt magically make it better.  Go back and watch the level of competition, ball movement and hustle in the 80s playoffs. It was light years ahead of anything we've seen this decade."

lakers,3d77uh,_TheEndGame,2,Tue Jul 14 10:46:48 2015 UTC,"Lol, I'm going to make this short and sweet.   Kobe was hyped up coming out of High School just like Lebron so what is your point? Lebron is not a top three player.   I couldn't careless what era, or how many MVPs he has. The man is under .500 in the finals. His statistics are blown up because of how shitty his teams have been including this years finals team. He's been the most chastised player because there was no one else in the league as good as him just like when Kobe was the most chastised player during his prime and Jordan before him and Magic before him. If there was one person with MORE fame than Lebron it's Jordan because he changed the game in more ways than one. I would argue that Jordan is still more famous than Lebron today worldwide.   Wilt was the most dominant big man the game has ever seen. He is a top 3 player and many including pros like Shaq agree.   Here's a re-done list:   MJ Kareem Magic Wilt Bill Russel Bird Kobe Duncan Lebron Shaq/Robertson"

lakers,3d84tb,moserftbl88,2,Tue Jul 14 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"Yes but the problem is it wasn't just for Randle it was Randle, clarkson, and our #2 pick. I know he didn't mention that but I think everyone knows by now that's what kings wanted. Cousins isn't worth that much young talent. If it was Randle straight up I don't think there's any question we'd have cousins right now."

lakers,3d84tb,pbsun,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:20:03 2015 UTC,"Russell is taking risks and that's what he needs to do at the moment. I see it like Kobe airballing the 3 pointers against the Jazz without giving a shit about doing it when he was doing it (obviously Kobe was more ballsy, doing it in the playoffs, but I think it's the same sort of mentality) . Players can play it safe and worry about making mistakes or they can risk it and make the mistakes and build their game by fixing those mistakes. IMO D'Lo is taking the right and best approach."
lakers,3d84tb,diondrems,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:50:09 2015 UTC,What I see in russell is that he dribbles with a purpose like a good player should. He isn't trying to do too much or over dribble but it all seems calculated. Yes he has had a lot of turnover but practice and the nba experience will help with that. He'll be very good. Can't wait for it to all come together.
lakers,3d84tb,dabolympian710,0,Tue Jul 14 13:55:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't wait to see what DJ will be able to do with some vets on the floor.

Not necessarily going to happen all the time with rookies and sophomores."
lakers,3d84tb,Wenjaman,2,Tue Jul 14 08:20:38 2015 UTC,DJ?
lakers,3d84tb,thranduil-,4,Tue Jul 14 22:02:15 2015 UTC,"Two notable things I saw from yesterday's game was that 1.) Julius Randle's offensive game is severely limited. I don't like the excuse of ""he's been injured for a year and hasn't been playing 5v5."" Sorry, but when Blake Griffin got injured for a year and came back he did not look as out of control and undisciplined as Randle. In fact he averaged a double-double shooting 50% 2.) Russell has amazing court vision and a smooth shooting stroke, but other than that needs to work on his quickness and strength, both of which he can easily improve with hard work both during the regular and off-season."
lakers,3d84tb,WesJohnsonGOAT2024,8,Tue Jul 14 18:01:08 2015 UTC,"Great analysis. The only aspects of SL that translate in terms of stats are defensive: http://m.espn.go.com/nba/story?storyId=9492294&lang=ES&wjb= . So the guys who are hot offensively and are terrible offensively, none of that is an indicator of any of their futures. But when they beat people off the dribble, clear space, have certain mentalities, show their IQ, these things will always be there. And that's what I really like about Randle and Russell. Russell already seems like a leader out there, taking over huddles, he's very verbal. Randle already has that killer, relentlessly attacking attitude that we love from the Mamba. It can get tunnel-visiony but that will be a good thing when no one can stop him."
lakers,3d84tb,redundantPOINT,3,Tue Jul 14 07:46:17 2015 UTC,"You've picked out all the good traits.   I know a lot of people are down on Randle and Russell right now, but honestly, that's what rookies do.   If Randle averages 12/8 and Russell goes for 14/6 it would be a solid, successful rookie season. I know they're nowhere near that now, but it's summer league. Give the rookies at least until the all star break."
lakers,3d84tb,Theoryman101,2,Tue Jul 14 13:46:02 2015 UTC,Exactly. Realistic numbers that they can build on
lakers,3d84tb,BuyAllTheVowels,3,Tue Jul 14 17:04:01 2015 UTC,"Based on what I see in the summer league, I think both Russell and Randle are not ready for the starter role.  They both have great potential but I think the expectations game is a little too high for them considering how little experience they have in the NBA.  Running them as starters and not playing well initially will ruin their confidence.  Of all the rookies, Larry Nance Jr. handled the speed of the NBA the best and looked the most ready.  A. Brown looked good but isn't NBA ready yet.  Clarkson should be the starting point guard, Tarik Black should be the starting power forward, and Kobe Bryant should be the shooting guard.  The most NBA ready rookie, Larry Nance Jr, should get the starter role at the three.  He will provide defense and hustle.  He's not a great shooter right now but with a Clarkson/Bryant backcourt, he doesn't need to.  I know Byron announced the starting lineup of Russell, Clarkson, and Bryant at the three.  But it doesn't mean he can't change his mind."
lakers,3d84tb,vtechnique,6,Tue Jul 14 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"Well put. They're still young and need to develop of course, but the potential is there.   Most of Russell's turnovers seem to be because he's seeing things other guys just aren't. There's a couple of easy remedies though: (1) playing with the vets who are faster and better at handling hot passes and (2) building chemistry so everyone on the team knows to be ready on every cut and curl and we'll see a lot more finishes to those passes.   The fact that he sees the development of the play and has the balls to swing the pass in is what excites me."
lakers,3d84tb,SirPovertus,2,Tue Jul 14 07:28:02 2015 UTC,"Agree. Both him and Randle are pretty bad, and I don't see them suddenly getting better.  They are going to get abused during regular season.  Jclark and Larry Nance on the other hand, have been fantastic."
lakers,3d84tb,ape_cage,2,Tue Jul 14 16:48:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Russell. He had flashes of brilliance with his passing game that shows you the court vision this kid possess. Give him time to adjust. The game is a lot faster than when he was in college and he needs to learn that some passes just doesn't work in the NBA as it would get picked off. Add onto the fact that SL is a clusterfuck environment with players having very little chemistry with one another causes DLo to turn the ball over more than he should. I have faith in this kid. Give him a break people, he's a 19 yrs old that didn't even play a single actual NBA game yet and there are some of us here acting like hes a bust."
lakers,3d84tb,DrunkElectric,5,Tue Jul 14 19:58:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's the first time 90% of this sub has watched any summer league. They're expecting something comparable to pre-season... but no, its not even that level. It's like pickup ball with the loosest semblance of offense."
lakers,3d84tb,thranduil-,3,Tue Jul 14 09:18:43 2015 UTC,"i think this analysis is pretty silly, you basically think every guy has potential to be a starter/heavy minutes bench guy on a playoff team. just my analysis on the guys you listed:  clarkson: guy's a stud. he has all the tools to succeed and the attitude. loved him last year too  tarik: good hustle but just incredibly raw still. im not sure he'll ever develop the way he needs to with the lakers staff but he can definitely be a solid rebounder.   jabari: he can score but im not very impressed, i think best case scenario is off the bench spark kind of guy  julius: he can get to the rim but hes too small in the nba to finish and doesnt have the court awareness of a zbo to make up for it. he got by in college with it but i think he has bust all over him  russell: he's been awful so far. maybe 2/8 turnovers werent his fault because teammates werent looking but seriously, rewatch the tape sometimes he just lost control. i like that he does try to get people involved like someone else said but he is dreadfully slow and im not sure that is something that'll just get better with time. im going to hold out hope but i just really think this was a mistake, especially with having clarkson.   all in all, maybe im just pessimistic but i dont see many of these guys panning out, especially with the current staff. i think russell has a knack for the game but he is just too sloppy and slow. randle is a lost cause though, i was never impressed with the guy before his injury and i think its starting to show, he just doesnt really get off the ground or finish the way he needs to...he also really needs to develop a midrange but he seems afraid to do so right now"
lakers,3d84tb,harleq01,4,Tue Jul 14 15:29:21 2015 UTC,"Russell is sloppy and slow... Randle is a lost cause... It's been two games during summer league....what do you expect? I mean shit, if Mitch made these assumptions off of summer league play, he should go find summer league all stars Adam Morrison and Michael Beasley and sign them right away."
lakers,3d84tb,KobeHardensMyDirk,0,Tue Jul 14 17:49:41 2015 UTC,"I agree some of what you said, and it's good to see some objectivity your post. I also find it crazy to think that every single one of these players are going to be equal contributors for a playoff team or have the kind of impact that everyone hopes. That just isn't going to be the case. I actually do have to agree with your view on Randle. He doesn't seem to be showing much promise out there. Has almost zero touch around the rim and little to know sign of that ""improved"" jumper of his. What I don't totally agree on, however, is your assessment of Russell. I wouldn't say he's dreadfully slow as much as he isn't as explosive as some of the more prolific PGs in the league. But agility and strength are something that are easily fixable with time in the gym/training facility. While his turnovers seem to be a large concern I believe it's because of a variety of factors including:     a.) Teammates not being ready (as many have already observed)     b.) Trying to do too much. He has the right idea but sometimes he just has to make the simple   fundamental passes over the flashy highlight reel plays     c.) Similar to the first point, it's the group of guys he's around. He's playing with a bunch of guys who have also just gotten their fair share of NBA exposure and their level of inexperience influences how he can play as well     d.) Age. He's 19 years old. It 's different being a 19 year old 7 footer and being a 19 year old PG. Look at Mudiay. Last night he has 10 pts, 8 assists, but what ppl fail to mention was that he had 5 TOs and went 4-13 shooting. Albeit, still better than Russell's stat, Mudiay isn't exactly CP3 out there. He got many of those points/assists because he is incredibly athletic which bailed out some of his miscues and misplays. While Russell may never be as athletic, he can still certainly improve the physical aspect of his game."
lakers,3d84tb,clnsdabst,2,Tue Jul 14 19:41:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly, people need to chill out about Russell. It's much easier for a big man to do well in a SL type scenario than a passing guard. That's because passing requires team chemistry and a much better timing of the game. However, I think DLo is looking to pass too much. He needs to go full aggressive on the scoring. Becuase if he can prove that he can score, then the defense will respect it and fear his passing. Right now all they're doing is anticipating his passes at the 3 point line and steal the ball."
lakers,3d84tb,whitejumper,2,Tue Jul 14 18:51:52 2015 UTC,"Julius: can't say how excited I am about this kid. His size, speed, quickness, and strength combine for a very tough cover. All this negativity Ive seen on this sub about Julius is bonkers to me. Kid just got back to playing 5 on 5 ball, let alone in front of thousands of people.   The dude looks like the MonStars from Space Jam stole all his skills. Almost every time the guy got the ball in his hands it resulted in a TO or near turnover; and therefore a liability. His jump shot and touch got a lot worse. I see D-League for him in the near future."
lakers,3d84tb,clnsdabst,2,Tue Jul 14 14:52:14 2015 UTC,It's ridiculous to me you only say ONLY good things about our young guys. There is literally not one negative thing. HAVE YOU WATCHED ANY OF THE SUMMER LEAGUE WE LOOK LIKE SHIT.
lakers,3d84tb,sublime1123,3,Tue Jul 14 16:47:21 2015 UTC,"While I dont agree with everything the Original Post said, I wouldnt call our rookies total bust. Russell has been struggling to adjust to the NBA playing time. All those TO's has been rather horrendous, but he also had some excellent ones when in transition. He was making passes too ahead of his teammates but that should be commended as he is seeing the field 1-2 steps ahead of other players on the court. This is a just chemistry issue for these players thrown together to play a pickup game. 3 games in!!! The fact that you think ""WE LOOK LIKE SHIT"" is because it seems like Lakers play no half court offense. The players play alot of ISO post and wing but there is no ball movement. No players running around the court around screens and double screens to get free. In that aspect, i think its reflective on the coaching. At the end of the day, there is no Summer League correlation and regular season performance. No need to get upset."
lakers,3d84tb,ape_cage,2,Tue Jul 14 19:02:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think our rookies are busts after 3 exhibition games, this isn't my first year watching sports :).   I agree with all of your points relating to our offense (or lack there of), unfortunately it reminds me of last season. The team isn't what upsets me, I understand the growing pains associated with young athletes with high expectations. It's the rose tinted viewpoint of some of our comrades that makes us look stupid in the public forum that makes me mad. Things aren't all good right now, talking about how great everything looks is absurd to me. FYI of the 3 days we've played we scored the LEAST amount of points on 2 of 3, the day we didn't score the least we beat the 76ers and had the 2nd least. We are avg.ing <70 ppg while the avg. looks to be around 80-85."
lakers,3d84tb,sublime1123,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:08:41 2015 UTC,What a lot of people are missing with Russell is the fact that half his turnovers are caused by guys either not being where they should be (rolling slow on pick and rolls) or not having their hands in the ready position
lakers,3d84tb,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,3,Tue Jul 14 22:12:37 2015 UTC,"I think at least 2 TOs so far in the SL have been from guys catching his passes with a foot out of bounds, too."
lakers,3d84tb,arch_wizard,3,Tue Jul 14 14:33:53 2015 UTC,"Just last night Anthony Brown caught a pass out of bounds, Black didnt roll hard so pass went off his finger tips and Russell drove and instead of Jabari Brown rotating to the corner to create a passing lane he just stayed out at the top of the key."
lakers,3d80nr,chexmixmix,25,Tue Jul 14 05:56:09 2015 UTC,"Tarik Black essentially made Jordan Hill replaceable. He can be our energy rebounding and put back guy for 15-20 min a game, at a fraction of the cost."

lakers,3d80nr,osama-bin-dada,0,Tue Jul 14 21:31:47 2015 UTC,"The real problem is the rotation now. You got Russell, Kobe, Clarkson, Lou Williams, Jabari Brown on the guard rotation. Then we have Bass, Randle, Tarik Black (and also Ryan Kelly but he probably won't play much) all fighting for minutes at the PF. I don't know how Byron will balance this out.   Our team is assembled like a pick up game team. Just random guys thrown together, with many players doing similar things as one another. Minutes distribution will be like last year, inconsistent for everybody.  Edit: also have Larry nance fighting for PF minutes."
lakers,3d80nr,ss3happy1,4,Tue Jul 14 19:55:03 2015 UTC,He has more experience than almost anyone else he's playing against. Same goes for Clarkson. How this translates to actual NBA games we'll have to see.

lakers,3d80nr,dissphemism,2,Tue Jul 14 07:28:34 2015 UTC,"He seems to have worked on his free throws, low key. I'm not sure what his % was, but the ones I saw him make had very good form."
lakers,3d80nr,dabolympian710,2,Tue Jul 14 08:18:08 2015 UTC,"I've been a fan of him since last season.  Make no mistake, he's not going to be a star, and if he plays more than 20 min a game then something will have gone horribly wrong for us.  But he fits a role perfectly as the energy/hustle big that grabs rebounds and can play some passable low post defense.   At this point we are still looking for guys that fit roles so that we can have some clue how to build going forward, and he looks like one of those guys."
lakers,3d80nr,gpholmes1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:36:45 2015 UTC,"He struggles on D in the post at times, but otherwise pretty solid and great hustle. His help D is also worth noting. I think some strength training will go a long way for him to cover some of his weak spots."

lakers,3de0wp,WOX_69,2,Wed Jul 15 15:15:54 2015 UTC,"Nice. 2k12 was the last NBA 2k game that I enjoyed. I bought the same version you did, with Magic on the cover, except for the PS3. Sort of wish I hadn't sold it :(  Good stuff though. Cool that you got it autographed, man!"
lakers,3de0wp,Remote95,2,Wed Jul 15 23:57:27 2015 UTC,"Lol, oddly enough I think NBA 2K12 was the one I hated the most, and I've been playing every iteration since 2K7. 2K12 just had too many glitches, bugs, exploits and the controls were far too laggy and unresponsive, not to mention the terrible servers. 2K14 may be up there for me in regards to play due to the huge amount of server issues and need for virtual currency. Plus they butchered MyPlayer.  The game I loved most from a gameplay perspective was 2K9. Controls were great and responsive (I cut actually cut with my offensive play without making a huge winding loop around the court and I could respond accordingly on the defensive end.) and the servers at least worked three-quarters of the time. That was the last game I played online competitively (Sans blacktop and TeamUp). As many cheesers as there were, it wasn't as bad as now. And overall it was just plain fun for me."
lakers,3de0wp,Remote95,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:08:03 2015 UTC,"Man, 2k9 was awesome(except for KG being on the cover)! That game is what got me into the series. I didn't play online much, but I loved association mode so much in that version. It was much more simple than it is now. Graphics, at the time, looked terrific. IMO, that's the game that officially put 2k over NBA Live."
lakers,3de0wp,badguymatt,2,Thu Jul 16 00:18:37 2015 UTC,"Sad thing was I knew going into the Finals that whoever won was going to get a player as their cover athlete. We could had Kobe a year earlier. Anyway, 2K9 is still my game that I herald as the best basketball game of all time.  Association now is mixed with VC nonsense which just cheapens the mode. Don't even get me started with that MyTeam stuff. Hell no I'm not buying VC just to get cards of players to put together a team. Hell no.  Also, I remember when 2K overtook EA in regards to basketball. I was working at the same Best Buy as mentioned and 2K7 and Live 07 came out the same day. 2K7 was thirty as opposed to Live's sixty. The demos had got everyone going crazy and 2K7 was just flying off the shelves. I remember I took a photo of one of the tables we had with both games on them before we opened. By the end of my shift the Live side of the table had barely been touched whereas 2K7 had been restocked several time."
lakers,3d7hff,Whubwhub,25,Tue Jul 14 02:57:52 2015 UTC,"Our offense is so bad. Pg brings ball up passes out. Runs around screens comes back on other side, gets the ball back. 8-10 seconds left. Pick and roll, shitty midrange. Such shitty offense"
lakers,3d7hff,Scabandiri,6,Tue Jul 14 03:09:32 2015 UTC,"Get used to it. It's largely what we were running this past season and why I hate Byrons sets.  How can you evaluate our guys properly when Byrons schemes are so bad and don't put them in a position to succeed?  It's so damn hard to get any good looks and there's so much standing around..with maybe ONE person moving so it's super telegraphed where the ball is going.  Just like last year, byron's offense doesn't create much..honesty the best thing we got is a high p&r with Russell or clarkson taking someone off the dribble.    The sucky thing is that someone actually needs to get really hot for this offense to be competent, and/or Kobe will bail Byron out bc he commands a double team.  Same shitty, unwatchable offense as last year."

lakers,3d7hff,blackhillsgold,13,Tue Jul 14 03:07:36 2015 UTC,After being excited for days to see the young trio play for the second time. I'm very disappointed that not one was able to play a good one.   Complete letdown.
lakers,3d7hff,JMD__,24,Tue Jul 14 03:05:19 2015 UTC,what is mark madsen doing? the offense is unrecognizable. how can we judge the young players? it looks like they are playing pick-up out there.
lakers,3d7hff,Boozers_Hair_Care,13,Tue Jul 14 03:04:32 2015 UTC,Honestly it would've been better if they were playing pickup.  I think whatever they tried to get these guys to learn has them over-thinking.
lakers,3d7hff,sharkytowers76,56,Tue Jul 14 03:14:27 2015 UTC,Take away from the game..  -Mark Madsen has no idea what he is doing  -Julius looks like he hasn't played in front of a crowd in a while..which is the case  -I guess they didn't inform Mike Breen & Walt Frazier they would be on NBA TV  -D'angelo at 19 is consistently hitting step back midrange jumpers off the screen and roll.. future is bright  -All of D'angelo threes are short...Has to get used to the three point line moved back.
lakers,3d7hff,Dmanning2,16,Tue Jul 14 03:01:57 2015 UTC,"The first point is actually worth discussing and isn't an overreaction to mixed Summer League results (not that I don't think your other points aren't spot on, because they are).  Madsen is fine to be on the coaching staff, but with so many talented young coaches out there THIS is who the Lakers trot out to coach when the head coach isn't there?"
lakers,3d7hff,sharkytowers76,4,Tue Jul 14 03:19:54 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know why Byron isn't coaching himself? The dude is in the arena, and some head nba coaches like Derek Fisher are coaching their SL teams"

lakers,3d7hff,PantslessMan,4,Tue Jul 14 04:09:53 2015 UTC,Well they had Pressey coach when Byron's mother passed on...
lakers,3d7hff,aveydey,3,Tue Jul 14 03:46:03 2015 UTC,What do you mean about Breen and Frazier being on NBA TV?
lakers,3d7hff,clippjoint,12,Tue Jul 14 03:02:51 2015 UTC,the Knicks broadcast is being simulcast on NBA TV so we got Breen and Clyde Frazier calling the game
lakers,3d7hff,Wa1do,8,Tue Jul 14 03:06:23 2015 UTC,I couldn't stand Clyde. At one point he said Russell had all those turnovers and he doesn't even play the point.
lakers,3d7hff,lakerswiz,-2,Tue Jul 14 03:08:18 2015 UTC,"There was that foul on the draft pick from the Knicks (always fuck up his name) where it probably should have been a no call, but Clyde was like OMG CLARKSON ELBOWED HIM IN THE FACE. Even after the replay he was saying that.   lol no he didn't Clarkson wasn't even really close to tagging him in the face."
lakers,3d7hff,justgivingsomeadvice,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:39:25 2015 UTC,Maybe that they were so biased my eyes rolled out of their sockets? Some of their commentary was downright stupid. Just a guess though
lakers,3d7hff,Schneeky,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:06:58 2015 UTC,I hate the fact that they benched D'Lo...  He did have half the team's turnovers so I guess we can't blame them that much.
lakers,3d7hff,lakerswiz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:06:07 2015 UTC,-Mark Madsen has no idea what he is doing   You try getting guys that have been playing together for a week or two to run an offense.
lakers,3d7hff,Kauaileonard,42,Tue Jul 14 15:38:25 2015 UTC,Let the overreaction commence
lakers,3d7hff,sharkytowers76,13,Tue Jul 14 03:00:58 2015 UTC,Lol.  Indeed.  The overreaction is kind of hilarious to a large degree.  I think it speaks to how hungry Lakers fans are for good things to happen.
lakers,3d7hff,Kauaileonard,6,Tue Jul 14 03:16:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, on one hand it's annoying, but I guess it's just par for the course with the Lakers. Some of the stuff is pretty bad like you said tho"
lakers,3d7hff,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,4,Tue Jul 14 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"Lakers fans are used to winning and not being a bottom feeding team for such an extent. Only the second time in history they've been out of the playoffs for 2 consecutive years and they haven't gone longer than 8 years without making a Finals appearance, which they usually double or triple up. As an LA fan, Dodgers, and Kings I've been accustomed to being disappointed for many years on end but if you're a Lakers fan this is something out of a horror movie and it's pretty funny to see the overreaction. I just take it in stride and will enjoy watching our young guns develop"
lakers,3d7hff,FuckTheClippers,-3,Tue Jul 14 03:26:41 2015 UTC,"Dodgers   As a Kings/Angels fan, I'd like to point out that only the Dodgers and Clippers have no rings this millennium lmao."
lakers,3d7hff,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,6,Tue Jul 14 03:58:21 2015 UTC,Why a Kings fan and not a Ducks fan if you're an Angels fan. Why an Angels fan and not a Dodger fan if you're a Kings fan. I have so many questions!
lakers,3d7hff,FuckTheClippers,4,Tue Jul 14 04:05:20 2015 UTC,"I was a Kings fan before the Ducks even existed. I got into hockey like most people my age when Gretzky got traded to LA. I'm loyal to all my teams, never once did I consider jumping ship when the Ducks were founded. I grew up 5 minutes from Angels Stadium. Really had no choice since I always got free tickets as a kid and went to thousands of games. Kind of hard to not be a fan at that point"

lakers,3d7hff,Unknownchill,3,Tue Jul 14 12:46:08 2015 UTC,Some of the turnovers were not really all his fault. Some passes went In front of players that stopped their cut unexpectedly
lakers,3d7hff,hibby_,5,Tue Jul 14 09:51:13 2015 UTC,Give him time. John Wall sucked in his first years - try to imagine the Wizards without him right now
lakers,3d7hff,misterrunon,3,Tue Jul 14 07:39:59 2015 UTC,"The difference between John Wall is that at least he has athleticism to fall back on. It's too early to give up on him, of course, but it's definitely concerning."
lakers,3d7hff,sanjugo,0,Tue Jul 14 09:17:48 2015 UTC,He didn't suck this bad.
lakers,3d7hff,njain4,-3,Tue Jul 14 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"It's summer league, and as a passer it will take some time to learn about his teammates tendencies. You shouldnt worry at all about Russels turnovers until  a few weeks into the regular season"
lakers,3d7hff,PaperDesk,9,Tue Jul 14 04:04:52 2015 UTC,It's still worrisome when you turn the ball over 8 times in 22 minutes.
lakers,3d7hff,amarstan,7,Tue Jul 14 04:37:13 2015 UTC,"Nothing is worrisome! It's freaking summer league. Seriously, have any of you worrywarts ever intently watched a summer league game before? This sort of crap happens every year and has no correlation to how the players turn out on the other end.   The guy is 19 and is just learning. We have a year of college tape. He always had the weakness of athleticism. Nothing is surprising here. Higher TOs make sense as he's learning, and making mistakes. But we know he's incredibly smart and a great passer. He'll get better and it'll be fine.  For god's sake. Spoiled Lakers fans are acting like this is the first time they've watched summer league."
lakers,3d7hff,Wise-Old-Man,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:08:14 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, it probably is the first time most of these people have watched Summer league games.  I have never cared one bit about Summer league but here I am checking out what is going on because I am really tired of the Lakers sucking, much like most fans. But yeah, it's Summer league. Not even pre-season. It really means nothing."
lakers,3d7hff,PaperDesk,-5,Tue Jul 14 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"What's the point of summer league games then? What if Russell drops 50 next game, what do you say to that? It's doesn't matter because it's a SL game? Of coarse not, you'd be flipping shit about how he's the next Jordan. Do you even know what spoiled means? It's not spoiled to say that 8 turnovers in 22 minutes is bad. Are you so delusional that you can't see a bad performance for a player you like? Stop playing the summer league card only when it serves you. Accept the good and the bad of these games."
lakers,3d7hff,thehumangenius23,4,Tue Jul 14 06:17:43 2015 UTC,"whenever I see someone use the word ""delusional"" on here, they're usually the one being delusional.   he's young, he's learning. this isn't the time to press alarms. he's forcing things, but he's shown that he can slow the game down and adjust."
lakers,3d7hff,PaperDesk,0,Tue Jul 14 07:37:24 2015 UTC,"How is it delusional to look at the game he had and say it is worrisome that he turn the ball over so many times. Not like he was facilitating the offense with him only having 1 assist.  He's shown that he can slow the game down on a college level, he hasn't proven anything yet in the summer league. Let alone the NBA."
lakers,3d7hff,amarstan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:12:57 2015 UTC,"It's delusional because nothing can be ""worrisome"" in summer league. It's literally just an intersquad rookie mini-camp where guys who have never met play pick up basketball and acquaint themselves with the new rules.  It isn't a time to ball out. It's just a time to learn the way the game is different and get to know your teammates.   Fans should treat it like an all star weekend practice game. Just a walk through.  Looking at a box score and drawing conclusions is ridiculous. How many interceptions did Marcus Marriotta have in rookie mini-camp? Is that a cause for concern? Is it worrisome?"
lakers,3d7hff,MyDogIsMuffin,5,Tue Jul 14 17:08:00 2015 UTC,"Summer league is not to find out which rookies can play, but rather which rookies cannot."

That is unacceptable even if you are a rookie and if its summer leauge. Im not saying im going to give up on him, but come on fix the sloppy play."

lakers,3d7hff,KobeHardensMyDirk,12,Tue Jul 14 09:18:18 2015 UTC,Randle looks like one of the MonStars from Space Jam stole his basketball skill
lakers,3d7hff,Gardeon,8,Tue Jul 14 04:02:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not too fussed about Russell's turnovers. To me, that's him getting used to what NBA-level defenders are capable of doing, the speed of the game and just general decision-making and BBIQ issues that will get better with experience. He'll start to realise what passes he can and can't throw. I did like his mid-range shot when he comes off the pick and probes around the top of the key as the pick man rolls. That mid-range should be money for him at the next level.  I am a bit worried about his ability to get separation from his defenders though. He doesn't seem athletic enough to get away from defenders on his first step nor on his jump shots.  I would like for him to be more of a crafty player if time does prove that the athleticism isn't there. Finding seams in the defense with the smart play rather than brute-forcing his way through defenders should be his bread-and-butter. If he can combine a bit of Rondo/Nash craftiness with a great shooting touch, I think he'll be fine."
lakers,3d7hff,scottycinco,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:38:59 2015 UTC,"I think your last point directly ties into the turnovers. This isn't an offense that an NBA team would be running. The team has a week of practice, the players are mostly new to each other, and everyone is going for numbers. The strength of Russell's game is the craftiness, but the ""run around like chickens with their heads cut off"" style of the summer league is not suited for his style. I can't recall Russell shooting any 3's and I've seen him trail on fast breaks spotting up wide open behind the arc, and dudes just attack the basket looking for numbers. Every shot he takes is being contested because the ball isn't moving at all."

It shouldn't be surprising to see these kids light it up.   The thing is, we're not in win-now mode right now. I'm still pretty confident than when all three players are in their primes, D'Lo will be the best of the trio, and that's not me saying that as a homer."
lakers,3d7hff,BecauseGodardSaidSo,2,Tue Jul 14 05:45:01 2015 UTC,Man I hope you're right but I've got a sinking feeling about Russell. I never liked the pick and I believe this decision to not draft Okafor will turn out to be a huge mistake.
lakers,3d7hff,SwaggyPGOAT,3,Tue Jul 14 06:57:30 2015 UTC,"It's ""Okafor"" - and ya, he's been damn solid...light years ahead of Russell. Instead of renting Hibbert for one year, we could have actually had a C we could build around. Good PGs come out every single year...."

lakers,3d7hff,NicDwolfwood,13,Tue Jul 14 03:00:11 2015 UTC,never should of implemented a princeton offense in summer league.
lakers,3d7hff,kbx94,8,Tue Jul 14 03:00:37 2015 UTC,Hopefully the system is a little more effective when the regular season rolls around as I'm sure the coaching staff will work much more with the players so that they're on the same page. A couple of these guys won't even be on the roster at the start of the season anyway.  I would have liked to see some more PnR just because that's a staple of the game that you're going to see regardless of what system.  A lot of it is just lack of chemistry. I saw Nance and somebody else try and set a screen at the same spot at the same time and they both just kinda ran into each other. Hopefully the communication improves with more practice.
lakers,3d7hff,NicDwolfwood,4,Tue Jul 14 03:04:42 2015 UTC,Yeah. I was just saying this because they learned it on the fly.   The coaching staff should of implemented something more basic.
lakers,3d7hff,UpnUpvote,7,Tue Jul 14 03:07:45 2015 UTC,Should have*
lakers,3d7hff,NicDwolfwood,2,Tue Jul 14 03:22:14 2015 UTC,thank you for the grammatical correction :)
lakers,3d7hff,JustAGuy993,9,Tue Jul 14 03:22:59 2015 UTC,never should of implemented a princeton offense   Fixed.  Byron needs to go and he can take his shitty offense with him.
lakers,3d7hff,NicDwolfwood,9,Tue Jul 14 03:02:35 2015 UTC,The offense works well when you have the time to learn its principles. coaching staff more or less threw it on the team last week and its not a offense that leds itself well when it isnt learned properly  they should have just went to something simpler
lakers,3d7hff,JustAGuy993,12,Tue Jul 14 03:07:10 2015 UTC,It was designed to mask talent deficiencies for college players.  If we had rick adelman running it it would be one thing.  We have the tank commander instead.  The end result will be the same as it was when Mike Brown tried to implement it.  These are young players and they need to run and pick and roll teams to death.  This just continues to prove that the coaching staff is completely out of touch and archaic.
lakers,3d7hff,NicDwolfwood,4,Tue Jul 14 03:10:47 2015 UTC,"Im not sure i totally agree with all of that. Byron ran princeton last season, offensive results werent bad per se in that the lakers scored enough points. problem was they couldnt stop anyone. It was definitely better than the princeton ran by Mike Brown  I agree though, run and gun & PnR would of been (simpler) better for these young kids Byron's methods are archaic, that's what the Team wanted from him because ""he knows winning"" and 'what it means to be a Laker"" blah blah blah Im certain byron is only the transition coach into the Lakers post Kobe Bryant era. he will coach his contract and the Lakers will get another coach once Byron has developed the young players enough"
lakers,3d7hff,JustAGuy993,2,Tue Jul 14 03:19:23 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, though I would say that last years players were more suited to the Princeton than this years' group will be (with the exception of Lin who Byron hated).  If we want Russell to have a chance he needs to be put in the pick and roll over and over again.  That's what his game is based around.    We can only hope Byron is out the door after this season."
lakers,3d7hff,NicDwolfwood,2,Tue Jul 14 03:26:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with that absolutely.   Byron is sticking around for the remainder of his contract i think. lakers have had 3 coaches in as many years, Plus at the moment i couldnt think of who would be the right guy to coach this team"

lakers,3d7hff,yatrickmith,6,Tue Jul 14 03:00:31 2015 UTC,"Tbh. There was nothing good about this game. Jabari Brown with, I think 20 points? That's it. Jordan Clarkson was good as usual. Everyone else was non-existent."
lakers,3d7hff,zunick,2,Tue Jul 14 03:02:14 2015 UTC,How did Russell/Randle look?
lakers,3d7hff,justgivingsomeadvice,9,Tue Jul 14 03:13:32 2015 UTC,"horrible. Randle with his usual tunnel vision. Russell turning it over a lot... really bad decision making on Russell's part.   Russell I'm still not too worried about. Everything about him screams that he needs to transition. All his 3s are short (probably not used to the NBA 3). He has a good feel for the game, he just either is too ahead of his teammates or he forces things (a good amount of his turnovers were like that).  Randle... idk. He gets to his spots, and is as fast and strong as advertised. But overall his game is just... meh. He's not finishing, which is what you'd expect for someone rusty, but it's his general mentality that needs to be changed. He's way too selfish out there imo."
lakers,3d7hff,zunick,7,Tue Jul 14 03:22:52 2015 UTC,"I know it's summer league and all, but I'm not being honest if I said I wasn't a little  concerned about Russell. However, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt since many current stars struggled in SL, while some who succeeded aren't necessarily thriving in todays NBA."
lakers,3d7hff,justgivingsomeadvice,0,Tue Jul 14 03:28:10 2015 UTC,"Russell's first step, or lack thereof, is concerning for sure. It's enough of a red flag that I'm a little worried his game won't translate either. His handles are also pretty mediocre and he seriously needs to tighten them up against NBA competition.   But with his turnovers and poor shooting, I'm not concerned at all. I really really wish we had Nash to mentor him though, older Nash is the perfect example of a guy who was an offensive stud despite having zero athleticism or quickness."
lakers,3d7hff,Citizen_of_Atlantis,2,Tue Jul 14 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"The reason why I'm excited about Randle is that when he's not rusty he's going to be an excellent ISO threat, in addition to all the other benefits he brings to the table.   He's a guy that you can count on to get a good look at the basket every time he has the ball (again, when he's in full form and not rusty).   Sure he has somewhat of a tunnel vision, that's always been his main weakness, but he's a guy I'll trust to be able to get shots out of a double or triple team and make them ala Kobe. You need guys like that for when an offense can get stagnant. Should/can he do that every play? ...well of course not, especially because he's not an SG/SF. But he's going to be a guy that you can give the ball to in critical moments and he's going to barrel to the lane and get a good look - either a bucket or get fouled. It's pretty much exactly what Lebron does."
lakers,3d7hff,xodus112,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:45:45 2015 UTC,"From what I'm seeing and hearing, it looks like Randle has all the tools but no floor game. That's a matter of gaining experience and what's in between your ears."
lakers,3d7hff,Scabandiri,3,Tue Jul 14 17:06:12 2015 UTC,"Ya even bough Clarkson did t shoot well, he was still good. Great D, drives, passing. Honestly the Knicks were pretty shitty too which made our players look even less shitty today. Except for Zinger, he's smart"
lakers,3d7hff,tmacgordon,3,Tue Jul 14 03:09:16 2015 UTC,"Everyone calm the fuck down.... On literally every single one of Russell's passes he had the right idea. From what I remember John Wall had like 12 turnovers in one game during summer league, Russell is still learning and he did a good job of getting in the lane today. I'm sure he'll be fine and ready to go when the regular season starts."

lakers,3d7hff,Brendan252,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:07:37 2015 UTC,"Have faith. I didn't get to watch this game but the previous games his turnovers have pretty much all come from him being just too quick for his team mates.  When he gets to NBA level with experienced players they'll be ready, even expecting him to pass it. ATM he's playing with guys who have never played with him before and can't read him.

lakers,3d7hff,NotDroopy,3,Tue Jul 14 04:18:11 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that Jeremy Lamb was great in Summer League last year.
lakers,3d7hff,justgivingsomeadvice,15,Tue Jul 14 04:49:44 2015 UTC,"Serious question, but wouldn't that make things easier because you're playing against opponents that are really bad as well? I know it's early in the offseason and they're trying new things but not much will change between now and the end of October when they're playing actual games. For the record I don't expect them to go out and win 50+ games next year by any means but I always read ""it's summer league"" and it doesn't really make me feel any better."
lakers,3d7hff,WesJohnsonGOAT2024,11,Tue Jul 14 03:08:03 2015 UTC,That's what scares me
lakers,3d7hff,thehumangenius23,4,Tue Jul 14 03:17:39 2015 UTC,"No. Look at the performances of star players in the summer league. They range from good to bad. Now look at performances of busts in the summer league. They range from good to bad. The point being that there doesn't seem to be a strong correlation one way or another.  Summer league isn't an indicator of that much, because if your game requires good court spacing, proper court balance, etc. well you're not gonna have it. People are also hustling pretty hard on defense to make the team; not many ""James Hardens"" on defense when everyone's fighting to make the team.   It's far better to make comments about people's games. For example, Anthony Brown has a good sense of court awareness/ balance from what I've watched. He tends to be in the right spot to receive the pass. He has also stepped out of bounds on the corner more than a few time, which is a simple adjustment he'll make. He has good footwork manning up on D. He doesn't have much of an ability to finish near the basket. Nance has a fucked up jump shot, and his game is essentially limited to being a hustle guy until he develops one.  So if you're looking at Russell, what do you see? A decent stepback. 3 pointers that are too short (he'll adjust to the NBA 3). Turnovers where he's either forcing something, going for the flashy play, or ahead of his teammates... stuff you'll learn. Surprisingly good on defense, uses his length well there. Serious lack of explosiveness, but he got past his defender better today.  How will that translate? Honestly, probably pretty well. Playing with scrubs in a structured offense with no time to actually learn it... it's not a surprise he's having a hard time adjusting. He'll need to get a deadly jumper to compensate for his lack of explosiveness (i.e. use the threat of his jumper to get to the basket consistently). He also seems to get frustrated and it took him out of his game."
lakers,3d7hff,_Meece_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:30:11 2015 UTC,"Yup. SL is the time to analyze the potential of their intangibles. I like Randle's intangibles, his ability to clear space/quick first step is somewhere between ZBo and Lebron. Russell has a smooth midrange shot off the screen that reminds me of Steph. He's still looking for teammates but there was no off-the-ball movement by his team. Despite the fact that he's leading the team in TOs, he's also 2nd in rebounding, 3rd in points, 1st in assists so far. He's clearly trying to do everything he can to impact the game, and this kind of stuff will matter 2-3 years from now."
lakers,3d7hff,Loryk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:10:49 2015 UTC,"these guys are warming up and getting a feel. everything is moving too fast for them, but they have the right people around them to teach them how to slow the game down and take control.   the talent is there. Randle and D'Angelo are 19 and 20. Wiggins started out slow last year and so did Jabari."

lakers,3d7hff,JustAGuy993,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:29:24 2015 UTC,"You're missing the point of what SL is all about. This isn't a semi-finished product where players are just working it out. It's a glorified exhibition pick up game with a bunch of guys who barely know each other.  So no, certain players will look amazing in summer league and spend the rest of their days in China. While other players will look horribad in summer league (to a fan) and go on to have very successful NBA careers.  You need to think of summer league as the 4th Quarter of an NFL preseason game, except neither team has had a training camp yet. They're just feeling things out. Stats mean nothing and it's more about getting their feet wet and learning the little quirks.  Players who naturally perform well in SL are usually the pure scorers and the elite athletes. This is because they were made for pick up basketball. Hence, Okafor and Mudiay will look really great because they just need to keep doing what got them to the dance. Whereas a player like Russell who was never athletic; and whose primary abilities revolve around long range shooting, court vision and passing, have a lot more of a learning curve before they look good. Especially if they don't know their teammates.   So you shouldn't think of SL as easier NBA. You should think of it as some fun pick up games for everyone to get to know the rules and their new teammates. It's just fun times for the fans and should be treated more like an all star game than some sort of indicator of future success."

lakers,3d7hff,dood23,3,Tue Jul 14 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, he was starting to get into a rhythm in the 4th quarter. I attribute most of his clumsy play this SL to rust coming off an injury. He's still going to be a stud."

lakers,3d7hff,srekalal,5,Tue Jul 14 06:39:57 2015 UTC,Absolutely horrible
lakers,3d7hff,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,4,Tue Jul 14 03:04:13 2015 UTC,"Take aways:  I noticed  there's nothing wrong with the Princeton offense it's just the players running it have no clue how to use it.   Thompson was talking about running plays.... I agree they should have some set plays when things get stagnant out there. Spurs run plays and you can see teams have no clue how to guard set plays so why not run plays instead of p&r and ISO the whole game.  Randle: There's a actual scouting report on Randle and they know what he's going to do now. There's no surprise like last season that he can dribble. Also he seems to forget  it's ok to shot jump shots and not try to break the defender down constantly. He's making himself very predictable. And Randle ever heard of rolling after the screen? Needs some lessons from the mailman.   Clarkson: he's good to go  Russell: got some teammates with weak offensive awareness. Great ideas on some of his passes just his teammates weren't aware of them. The vets on lakers actual team won't make the same mistake. Step back j is nice, may turn into James harden step back type of weapon. His 3pt shots are short, still getting used to the 3pt range I imagine so not too worried about that. Id like to see more steve Nash like probing to draw defenders in and he should look to be a little more aggressive to start  because I'm pretty sure the opposition is expecting a pass from him right now.  Overall: it's just difficult because we have a lot of ISO type of players and all theses guys are trying to show off to make teams. Put together the fact they don't know the offense too well so a pretty ugly game is the result. But no worries, just let Randle know he needs to mix it up and trust his j, tell Clarkson to keep doing his thing and keep growing as a player, and Russell should know to keep his head up because he's better than what the stat line is making him look like."

If he sucks for the whole summer league, I really don't give a fuck. Summer league is the least indicative of anything. I honestly don't care. Same with Randle even though both showed alot of flashes. Randle just needs to finish which comes through repetition. D'angelo had a rough day but we've seen the dimes he throws. The three will come through repetitiion. Can't get much worse then today though. But everybody whose already labeling Randle and Russell as busts shouldn't even be taken seriously."

Those offensive sets are terrible, and completely predictable. I never expected any rookie to come in and be the savior for this franchise, but yikes."

I get it -- he was playing bad, but this is freakin' Summer League. Let him make all the mistakes he wants, so he can learn from them. Who cares if they lose. It's a meaningless SL game.   Summer League is only opportunity for the rookies to play together as a team until training camp -- which lasts about a week, and then pre-season games start when they'll get less playing time as the vets and camp invitees have to play as well.  Playing time right now is so valuable for the rookies. SMH.  Would have liked to seen more Upshaw as well."

lakers,3d6yl3,Schneeky,6,Tue Jul 14 02:11:35 2015 UTC,Phil trash talking Jeanie
lakers,3d6yl3,wearethenewvr,16,Tue Jul 14 02:12:33 2015 UTC,randle is not in game shape
lakers,3d6yl3,thevisitor,13,Tue Jul 14 02:12:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not that worried about D'Lo's turnovers to be honest. A. its because he's trying to be super flashy at times where it just is not smart ball, and if he learns to be smarter in the NBA level the hard way then so be it, and B. When he does have good looks the teammates couldn't follow through and catch it or deliver on it. He will definitely get better at it with time.   Randle on the other hand, yeesh. I really want him to get better. Please produce in the 2nd half man. :("
lakers,3d6yl3,randy88moss,17,Tue Jul 14 02:16:24 2015 UTC,How many PPG is Randle going to avg for the Defenders this year? :/

lakers,3d6yl3,BeefCat10,4,Tue Jul 14 01:08:50 2015 UTC,Julius is too predictable. He needs to develop a mid range game or he's going to be absolutely fucked offensively.
lakers,3d6yl3,yungpine24,5,Tue Jul 14 01:09:49 2015 UTC,He just needs to learn how to pass. Knicks already know. They over help on him every time because he refuses to pass it out.
lakers,3d6yl3,saskenasy,3,Tue Jul 14 01:08:43 2015 UTC,"Yea but he's so out of control going to the basket, he can't possibly pass."

lakers,3d6yl3,Theingloriousak2,6,Tue Jul 14 02:13:05 2015 UTC,I honestly believe that Russell will be much better after more time practicing and playing in the actual NBA. He already has the vision and passing ability he just has to tune it
lakers,3d6yl3,santokimilktea,3,Tue Jul 14 02:19:05 2015 UTC,"half his turnovers are just guys not expecting the pass. from all the interviews i've seen, i think he and the coaches agreed to keep doing it on purpose so guys will eventually look for the pass."
lakers,3d6yl3,BerriesNCreme,10,Tue Jul 14 02:25:58 2015 UTC,im not worried about russell  but randle is just bad
lakers,3d6yl3,igoforthejugular,8,Tue Jul 14 02:42:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm a littleeee worried too. Thing is Russell can work on his skills, but no matter how good Randle gets, he's going to be a black hole on offense (either he makes it or he doesn't). You have to be on Kobe-level great to be able to consistently be an iso player. Randle needs to know when to pass it out or play off the ball. Can't just be an iso player."

lakers,3d6yl3,santokimilktea,3,Tue Jul 14 01:08:52 2015 UTC,Randle needs to pass when he gets doubled or tripled. Brown needs to pass on the fastbreak. Black needs to stop fouling so much. Dlo needs to play at a faster pace. Clarkson.....well clarkson is the only one I dont have complaints about.
lakers,3d6yl3,BeefCat10,4,Tue Jul 14 01:09:19 2015 UTC,What is the team's favorite dessert? Turnovers
lakers,3d6yl3,Schneeky,2,Tue Jul 14 01:23:12 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it too much. I watch summer league all the time and if you compare it to NBA games you're not going to have a good time.   SL games are HORRIBLE. There may be a few good games, but I've been to SL games where there were 0 dunks. Players are just not as good/athletic/cohesive as a regular season game.   You gotta look at SL games with a different perspective of how players are going to develop. i.e. ""dang Russell will be phenomenal once get develops a quicker step"" rather than ""damn Russell blows and isn't explosive at all"".  You'll enjoy watching more if you just change your perspective a little."
lakers,3d6yl3,Cbino321,4,Tue Jul 14 01:23:54 2015 UTC,How can Randle be out of control all the time?

lakers,3d6yl3,davidcroda,7,Tue Jul 14 02:52:13 2015 UTC,That was a awesome shot by Russell. IMO Russell tries to be too flashy with his passes like trying to pass through a lane full of dudes. It worked in college but he has to adapt to the NBA
lakers,3d6yl3,AaronCraftsCheeks,5,Tue Jul 14 01:08:48 2015 UTC,Brown pass the fucking ball
lakers,3d6yl3,jordanthejordna,6,Tue Jul 14 01:33:19 2015 UTC,Porzingis is dirtyyyy.
lakers,3d6yl3,frank_6969,6,Tue Jul 14 02:05:30 2015 UTC,Russell's passing will get better as he gets to know his teammates and builds chemistry. The main thing I noticed about him at OSU was his proggression through the season. At the beginning he was just going through the motions and at the end he was dropping cross-court no look dimes.

lakers,3d6yl3,BeefCat10,4,Tue Jul 14 00:57:09 2015 UTC,Randle looks really rusty out there. I feel like that injury break is going to take a while to get over. most of the guys playing tonight have probably never had a significant time off from playing basketball in their entire lives yet this is Randle's second game after a nine month break.
lakers,3d6yl3,megavino,5,Tue Jul 14 01:02:43 2015 UTC,Brown makes an appearance. Good hustle plays on both ends of the floor. That would have been an easy lay-up or alley-oop for the Knicks if he hadn't run back.

lakers,3d9e95,Mr_Chandler_Bing,3,Tue Jul 14 15:05:51 2015 UTC,"I hope he's better than his stats show. The bigger question is, who are we going to release? Our roster is full."
lakers,3d9e95,Buckelroo,2,Tue Jul 14 15:20:55 2015 UTC,Kelly? Jabari?
lakers,3d9e95,TheAsianMamba,4,Tue Jul 14 15:24:39 2015 UTC,Kelly.
lakers,3d9e95,BABYPUBESS,-2,Tue Jul 14 15:50:07 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the game yesterday? Jabari is real, dude."
lakers,3d9e95,Buckelroo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:27:56 2015 UTC,He was good but be has no place on our roster and would just get buried on the 2 rotation
lakers,3d9e95,TheAsianMamba,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:37:32 2015 UTC,Huh? I could not disagree more. We absolutely need another combo guard and Jabari is it.
lakers,3d9e95,wanderfound,0,Tue Jul 14 19:22:46 2015 UTC,"Considering he can play the point, he definitely has a spot. With Kobe playing the 3, we only have 3 guards. Jabari is a consistent score that can become a great 6th man and run the offense off the bench."
lakers,3d9e95,Buckelroo,3,Tue Jul 14 15:49:35 2015 UTC,"Kobe isn't going to exclusively play the 3 next year and Jabari has no future running the point in the NBA.  He's a development project that can hopefully be a spot up shooter and decent defender, worth a roster spot more so than Kelly"

lakers,3d87sw,rebeltrillionaire,8,Tue Jul 14 07:18:16 2015 UTC,"Check out the comments from 7 years ago and then think about D'Angelo.   It's easy to see Rose for what he was good at in the video knowing that he'd end up being an MVP scorer who predicated his game on elite slashing and acrobatic layups.   If you thought he was a scrub though what do you see? A skinny child who can't keep up with Summer League players on Defense, can't shoot, can't dunk, and his best skill - slashing to the basket, doesn't even result in buckets or fouls half the time.   Just a reminder that not only is ""It's Summer League"" a viable excuse this week for any of our guys playing poorly because it isn't a real NBA game and the talent isn't all NBA levels, but not only did Rose win ROY he'd go on to win an MVP and be the star of a contending team for years (besides his injuries).   Please folks. Just relax and when he does have a breakout game, celebrate it!"
lakers,3d87sw,Ksanti,3,Tue Jul 14 07:24:53 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I feel like we need modded flairs of ""has never watched Summer League before"" so that it's not people just freaking out that the standard isn't as high as in the regular season and echoing around that"
lakers,3d87sw,srekalal,0,Tue Jul 14 12:08:01 2015 UTC,"Problem is that rose looked plenty fast twitchy and explosive in SL, that's something russell can't significantly improve by hitting the gym.  We got to hope that russell can significantly improve as a shooter to make up for it."
lakers,3d87sw,amarstan,2,Tue Jul 14 14:41:17 2015 UTC,"That's not a problem. Russell was NEVER  considered athletic. It was always considered one of his weaknesses. There are many very successful guards who weren't athletic. Expecting him to be Derrick Rose or Russell Westbrook is ridiculous. We didn't draft him to be a flashy scorer. We drafted him to be a calculating, smooth, smart PG."
lakers,3d87sw,scottycinco,2,Tue Jul 14 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"Exactly right. Everyone has said Russell's strength is his ""craftiness"" and ""court vision"". Why then are we freaked out that he's a couple poor games with a bunch of guys he's never played with, an offense he's never run, and a style that more resembles D-League ""get your numbers"" ball. He would never thrive in this situation."

lakers,3d87sw,Unknownchill,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:34:15 2015 UTC,This is excellent evidence for why we should all calm down and let a point guard with tremendous talent just grow. It may take a season or two but he will be a star

""Hype Town"" Madson is the lord's gift to all of us.   He's now proving he's that elite, next level coach.  What other coach would seek to install our NBA offense over the course of less than a week with Summer League kids? #ambition  What other coach would reward greatness by giving these 19 year olds a weekend day off in Vegas after their first team win? #COTY"

lakers,3d7qpj,ballamanjr,3,Tue Jul 14 18:29:21 2015 UTC,"Most definitely agree with that. This is by far the best part about Bryon Scott. He is a world class point guard developer. It makes sense too. When he was draft he got to play with the greatest point guard of all time in Magic. Then when he decided to coach, he became an assistant for the Nets when they had Jason Kidd (probably the 3rd best PG ever in the game). Then when he finally landed a HC position he help develop CP3 into the player he is today while also getting him the Rookie of the Year award. Then as the Cav's coach he coach Kyrie to the Rookie of the Year award. Probably the most impressive thing he has done (maybe a little biased here) is turn an athletic 2nd rounder into an All-Rookie first team member. If there is one man in the league I would want to mentor Russell, it's Byron."
lakers,3d7qpj,PaperDesk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:47:11 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything you said, but Byron was a head coach with the Nets and J-Kidd"
lakers,3d7qpj,LakersHawksGrizz,4,Mon Jul 20 07:29:02 2015 UTC,I STILL think he'll win ROY. Byron ain't no scrub
lakers,3d7qpj,ashishvp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:55:01 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it would have been better for Russell's growth for Jordan Clarkson NOT to be there in the summer league this year. Clarkson is playing well, but with Russell already pressing and trying too hard, Clarkson's game is not at all helping Russell's approach to the game and he looks like he's playing scared. Scared of making mistakes. Russell just needs to relax and play his game, and I don't think he's comfortable with that around Clarkson at this stage. I think it will change in training camp, like a few of you have said, being around Byron, and especially having the real alpha there in Kobe to put Clarkson in his place. You can see the flashes but Clarkson should have stayed home this year and I think that would have taken some pressure off of Russell."
lakers,3d7qpj,Syntic-V1,3,Tue Jul 14 14:31:39 2015 UTC,"Developing a good chemistry is too important for a point guard. He's only 19 and still learning the playbook. The more full speed play these two get together, the more they will grow and learn to play with each other. I also think the same applies for Clarkson to get used to running with these guys. And more importantly, I love what this is doing for his confidence. Think from his perspective - the Lakers just drafted a player to take the position Jordan filled at the end of last year. If you take him out of summer league you really risk making Clarkson not feel a part of the Lakers rebuilding plans. These two need to grow together, and keep learning each other's games. Give it some time and give Russell a few months to get his conditioning up for the NBA level."
lakers,3d7qpj,existentialsandwich,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:46:22 2015 UTC,We need JC and russel to play together so in hopes of the 2 building on court chemistry.
lakers,3d7qpj,FuriousFlex,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:53:53 2015 UTC,By All Star Break Russell is going to look like ROY after Byron has had a few months to work with him.
lakers,3d7qpj,aveydey,-1,Tue Jul 14 14:56:35 2015 UTC,"He better, because right now, he looks like a bust."
lakers,3d6rlr,powderblue17,5,Mon Jul 13 23:32:12 2015 UTC,"Okafor had 19/11/3 on us and reminded me a little of Pau with his touch on those banks & post moves. D'lo looked great passing and on the midrange j's, yet I can't help but speculate which of the two will end up having the better career."
lakers,3d7c95,yatrickmith,29,Tue Jul 14 02:16:09 2015 UTC,When he misses he's missing short and not left and right.  That's a good sign.
lakers,3d7c95,sharkytowers76,12,Tue Jul 14 02:56:31 2015 UTC,"curse you, professional 3-pt line"
lakers,3d7c95,DopeAndDoper,4,Tue Jul 14 03:37:00 2015 UTC,"He needs to add some strength to those legs.  Once he does that, h'e'll be hitting them at a high clip.  I'm really not as concerned about him as other people are.  To learn a completely new offense and be expected to run it, that's a lot to ask out of a guy whose skill is his ability facilitate.  A guy like Okafor can have an impact from day one because he's been doing the same thing he's always done.  It's a big transition for Russell, but I think he's fully capable and will come around."
lakers,3d7c95,Gotsmeez,21,Tue Jul 14 08:44:03 2015 UTC,"His shot off the pick is MONEY. He should get that regularly during the season too. That's what I'm excited for personally.  I think he should focus on running the offense, gaining some chemistry and getting a feel for the game first. The scoring can come later."
lakers,3d7c95,vino23,9,Tue Jul 14 02:33:38 2015 UTC,Loving his transition threes as well.
lakers,3d7c95,yungJoc,9,Tue Jul 14 02:55:37 2015 UTC,I fricken LOVE his shot. It looks so smooth. Almost to the point where I don't care if it goes in because it looks so damn nice.
lakers,3d7c95,santokimilktea,3,Tue Jul 14 02:53:03 2015 UTC,"I agree. When he releases it ALWAYS seems like it's going in. I never see him take a shot and cringe and think ""Ooohhh that was bad"" a la Rondo or Rubio. Unfortunately it's been short a lot in SL, but he just needs to get his stroke going."
lakers,3d7c95,ape_cage,3,Tue Jul 14 16:20:45 2015 UTC,Yeah. I agree.
lakers,3d7c95,yungJoc,14,Tue Jul 14 02:44:14 2015 UTC,Nah it's summer league. Let him and the teammates try some things out and get a feel for eachother. This whole team's offense is a mess anyway.

lakers,3d7c95,Schneeky,3,Tue Jul 14 03:38:49 2015 UTC,To our eyes
lakers,3d7c95,rtrainer30,3,Tue Jul 14 09:07:09 2015 UTC,"He is going to be more aggressive as the regular season goes on and he becomes more comfortable. He is a scoring guard, not a point guard like may think he is. He doesnt get in the lane and penatrate the defense like a PG."
lakers,3d7c95,ashishvp,3,Tue Jul 14 04:09:25 2015 UTC,"Reminds me a bit of CP3 with his midrange game. Obviously not as perfect, but I can forsee a lot of points coming off PnR in the regular season"
lakers,3d7c95,lolxddavid,4,Tue Jul 14 05:52:08 2015 UTC,His shot is already very good. That was one of his strengths coming out of college but his 3 point shot is a bit short since college 3 point line was further in. He needs to work on his passing. Most of his turnovers were from passes. I know he's already a very good passer but he needs to stop making them so flashy. He's trying to pass into the paint to let's say Black but there's like 3 other guys there who's there to deflect the pass.
lakers,3d7c95,lars5,2,Tue Jul 14 04:26:14 2015 UTC,"No, then guys won't learn to play attention to the passer and keep their hands in the ready position."
lakers,3d7c95,Iweloz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:54:46 2015 UTC,"I think part of the reason his threes are short so far is he has a tendency to lean back like Harden. I noticed it a lot last night. I feel like if he would just go straight up he'd be gravy. I figure he's trying to create separation, but he's 6'5"" so he should be able to get them off"

He just puts everything into the jump then seems to worry about everything else later.  I was a little incredulous when they said he had the highest standing jump at the rookie combine but he proved me wrong. Hopefully as he gets more experience he'll be able to better utilize those amazing hops.

lakers,3d7rvs,Buckelroo,32,Tue Jul 14 07:50:51 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I couldn't agree more. The fact is NOBODY would be saying ""it's summer league"" if we were winning, and Randle was putting up big numbers. The facts are, at this time, our #2 pick looks like he's running in sand. He is incapable of taking anyone off the dribble. Without dribble penetration he has to settle for long passes that often end in turnovers. Randle, boy oh boy does this kid have some problems. I hope this past week has been a glaring notification that his offensive arsenal is not going to cut it in the NBA. All of this ISO shit they let him do is painful to watch. If he can't bully-ball people in summer league, he certainly won't be able to in the NBA. We were made to believe that this past year, he has added the mid-range jumper into his game. Well, where is it? Hit a couple jumpers in some guys face and he'll play you real close. Then, use that quick first step to get some highlight buckets. Remember when everyone was saying ""Summer League Champions here we come!""? I do, and I know that I can't be the only one disappointed with these games. Randle and Russel are both a lot less NBA-ready than we hoped for. Training camp can't come quick enough.."
lakers,3d7rvs,oneone26,9,Tue Jul 14 04:44:23 2015 UTC,"Fully agree with you. I believe Russel NEEDS screens and picks to be able to penetrate as he does not have his threes yet. Once he gets in though that elbow jumper is money.  Randle on the other hand, I think is being overly aggressive as of now since he has not played since last year. I just hope his takes off his blinders once the season starts because he is an absolute black hole right now.  I hope they run more pick and roll with russel and randle. Will unlock more of Randle's potential that way instead of all this Iso shit they're running."
lakers,3d7rvs,scottycinco,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:57:41 2015 UTC,"I have seen Russell trailing on fast breaks wide open for 3 probably 4 or 5 times and I have never seen the kick out pass.   Also, something I've noticed is that the defenses in summer league stack the paint and make you kill them with mid range jumpers on the PnR. We don't have a big that can hurt anyone from outside to fade off the pick, so they just stack the paint and dare Russell to shoot.  Randle is being limited to 5 minute spurts. He's just trying to get his work in. He was getting hacked yesterday when he took his man to the basket, just wasn't called."
lakers,3d7rvs,p321p,0,Tue Jul 14 18:01:14 2015 UTC,"The only full Lakers SL game I saw was from today, so I have a limited scope. I also think Russell needs screens to get some room. But when he gets a screen, I noticed he doesn't work the screens well. Whatever he does, it's not allowing him to have the option of going towards the rim. Instead he just settles for a jumper off a screen. It could be the defense doing a good job on him, or the offense being stagnant, or maybe it's just Russell.    End of the day, Russell is still 19 years old with only one year of college ball under his belt. Majority of the game he played against Galloway and Grant who both played college ball for numerous years."
lakers,3d7rvs,Scabandiri,2,Tue Jul 14 06:13:26 2015 UTC,"None of our guys are setting good picks. They roll too early, miss the pick and a couple times dlo goes too late or too early but mostly our guys rolling too soon"
lakers,3d7rvs,ss3happy1,11,Tue Jul 14 07:30:49 2015 UTC,"That's what I think as well. I mean, the Summer League guys are usually the smaller, less quick, less skilled, less experienced players battling it out.   If Russell is too slow compared to them, imagine him guarding Westbrook or Lillard?   If Randle can't finish against these bigs, imagine him against Cousins or Dwight.   I'm not saying they can't improve, but summer league has so far been a disappointment - with the exception of our future franchise max-contract superstar player JORDAN CLARKSON."

lakers,3d7rvs,mngo,2,Tue Jul 14 16:40:49 2015 UTC,"Agree - there have been a couple videos of Kobe in SL posted in /r/nba, where he plays like a transcendent talent at the mere age of 17. I bet had we been watching Kobe in SL today, no one would be saying, ""it's just SL - it doesn't mean anything."" Everyone would be jizzing their pants. But because our rookies happen to be playing poorly, ""it's just SL"" is used to excuse their play. This is not to say that they won't develop into great players - I have high hopes that they do, but it's a double standard when the same people who would be excited over good play excuse bad play."
lakers,3d7rvs,fearlesspinata,0,Tue Jul 14 14:57:18 2015 UTC,For the most part you're actually right. But I think the problem is that with summer league you ignore the stats and focus on their play and what's happening. There are a lot of times where Dlo will make a pass that his teammate is simply not ready for or is unexpected. They are rarely bad passes. With that being said his conditioning needs work and this kid needs to hit the gym asap. You can't teach athleticism but with enough hard work on that end you can be batman.  Randle on the other hand seems to have like tunnel vision or something else going on. I love his aggression but at the same time he needs to reel it in and play within the offense. Ultimately that's what all this comes down to they need to play within the offense and within their roles.   Anthony Brown is great because he sticks to what he knows he does well. Larry gives us energy and effort. These guys know what they do well and do it. They have focus.  Clarkson is a whole different animal at this point as he's just making these rooks out there look like children.
lakers,3d7rvs,TooProYo,3,Tue Jul 14 15:34:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly it is though. It's just Summer League. I'm 100% sure that the coaching staff notices all the flaws of our team. After SL, I'm sure that the team would work on what's needed to be worked on. Russel is 19. If I can get quicker, he can get quicker.   I do agree though that this shouldn't be used as an excuse. It should be a reminder that the team still has time to improve before the season. They wouldn't be drastic, but they would be improvements.   (Rose was terrible in SL. Let's just hope that Russel, Randle, etc. improve like how he did)."
lakers,3d7rvs,CeeBeast,11,Tue Jul 14 05:54:46 2015 UTC,It'll stop being valid when it stops being summer league.
lakers,3d7rvs,CalmerThanYouAreDood,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:30:11 2015 UTC,The problem is 3 of our 5 likely starters or on our SL roster. They've got a lot of improving to do before November.
lakers,3d7rvs,stevebeyten,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:05:47 2015 UTC,"If you think we are going to play good basketball this year, you are in for a huge let down.  This season will be defined by growing pains.    Like you said - 3 of our 5 starters are going to be rookies or sophomores! Even if they play exceptionally well, we will look more like last year's TWolves' than an 8th seed.  And I don't even think that's a bad thing; people just need to get their expectations in check or get ready to be bitching a lot."
lakers,3d7rvs,_psymen,4,Tue Jul 14 15:27:20 2015 UTC,I remember that's what people said when they started 0-8 in preseason. Look at how that regular season turned out.
lakers,3d7rvs,MiNdHaBiTs,6,Tue Jul 14 07:54:01 2015 UTC,I heard on 710 today that CP3 and D Rose's summer league stats were somewhere around 9 and 3. Can't really judge anything based on summer league.
lakers,3d7rvs,yungJoc,9,Tue Jul 14 14:53:31 2015 UTC,"Go up and look at how durant and d rose played in summer league, it doesn't mean shit.  They're hardly running plays and none of these lineups will be put on an NBA floor till much later.  Russel will look a lot nicer next to Brandon bass and Kobe.  Also, did you guys think Russell was going to beat his man every time? He can create space with his handle and shoot off the pick amazingly well. That's his game and that's fine."
lakers,3d7rvs,BecauseGodardSaidSo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:16:10 2015 UTC,The thing is I'm not at all even bothering to look at the stats. I'm looking at the way Russell is playing and my God is he slow and clumsy with the ball.  Granted his shot is decent but outside of literally one nice pass in the first quarter of the Philadelphia game I've seen nothing impressive about Russell's game. At least with the summer league players you mentioned in durant and rose you saw flashes of their raw athletic and or skill set abilities. But seriously... People keep saying to not judge Russell to quick but I'm honestly not seeing anything to be excited about.
lakers,3d7rvs,showtimeb,2,Tue Jul 14 05:14:48 2015 UTC,"This is exactly how I feel while watching him play as well. He has a hard time getting by any defender because of his speed from what I've seen, especially in pick and roll situations where it should be slightly easier to break your defender he often just gets stuck because he's just too slow. I'm worried about how he will fair against the guards in the league who are bigger, stronger, and faster then all these SL guards Russell is going against. Hopefully I'm in the wrong here but I feel like there is some cause for concern at this point..."
lakers,3d7rvs,yungJoc,0,Tue Jul 14 07:17:33 2015 UTC,"That's fine - s'your opinion. For me his shot looks great, he does a few great passes per game, his handle looks good and I see enough to where I'm happy.  It goes both ways - can't get too hyped or too low from Summer league."
lakers,3d7rvs,dc041894,0,Tue Jul 14 15:01:45 2015 UTC,"A few of his passes have been truly great but his teammates don't realize they're open and either didn't look for the pass in time or weren't expecting the pass and drop it. There was a pass in the second and third summer game where he and Tarik ran a pick and roll and if Tarik had looked at the pass, would've led to an easy bucket. There was an entry pass to Nance Jr. where he should've taken the short open shot right from one of Russell's passes but instead decided to dribble into the defense. He's a talented passer but it's hard to make these passes when the offense is stagnant."
lakers,3d7rvs,stevebeyten,2,Tue Jul 14 08:42:42 2015 UTC,"We'll stop saying ""its just summer league""   When it's not longer summer league....  If these guys still look like this after a full summer of training camps, pre-reason and a month or so of regular season games, then yeah, I would say start panicking."
lakers,3d7rvs,njain4,6,Tue Jul 14 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"That's going to be my response for all these games. While i agree that it is disheartening to see some of the players not live up to hype it is important to take a step back and really stop caring about these games.  As a few people in this sub have pointed out, we have seen great players play like shit in SL, and shit players play great in SL, so you should take most of what you see during this time with a grain of salt.  Context is important too. Are you really that surprised that Randle looks lost out there in his second game 5vs5 game in a year? Is it surprising that a pass first rookie looks turnover prone when he has barely practiced this offence?  Relax, and enjoy the growing pains lakernation"
lakers,3d7rvs,BecauseGodardSaidSo,9,Tue Jul 14 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say it again, we're going to regret passing up Okafor for Russell."
lakers,3d7rvs,Sletts,11,Tue Jul 14 04:36:50 2015 UTC,"It's maybe because being a legit post up big man is so much easier to do in SL with weaker competition. He's been doing that at Duke. Compared to being a combo guard like Russ, there really isn't anything a lot to consider when having the ball on the post. Take your time and make a move. Dlo, however, has to get his teammates involved while evading opponents. There's just so much more responsibilities that come with being a guard in the NBA, hence the rusty display in the first 3 games."
lakers,3d7rvs,Robbeastt,18,Tue Jul 14 05:02:20 2015 UTC,"This year maybe, but in 5 years I'm not so sure. It was well known that Okafor is the most NBA ready player from the draft. That doesn't mean he will end up being the best player from this draft in the long run."
lakers,3d7rvs,mister_greyMATTER,10,Tue Jul 14 05:18:37 2015 UTC,"This year maybe, but in 5 years I'm not so sure. It was well known that Okafor is the most NBA ready player from the draft.

lakers,3d7rvs,xCoM24,-1,Tue Jul 14 05:34:34 2015 UTC,"Yes dude, it is definitely looking like Okafor is the more developed player at this point, but I am not going to write him off just yet.. once again what conclusion did I jump to?   edit: I think you are misinterpreting what I am saying.. just because I am saying Okafor is better than Russell, doesn't mean I think Russell is a bust.."

lakers,3d7rvs,amarstan,2,Tue Jul 14 05:44:31 2015 UTC,I mean just look at Mudiay compared to russell. They both have struggled with there shot in summer league but Mudiay can actually penetrate with his athleticism and create beautiful cross court weak side passes to find the open man. Its ok to struggle in summer league but you want to see flashes skills that will translate well to the nba and russell's issues all stem from his athelticsm. Cant get separation off the dribble and cant penetrate with confidence which leads to harder passes and turnovers. It just worrisome how his game will look in the nba against stronger players for someone taking at #2
lakers,3d7rvs,Counter423,8,Tue Jul 14 05:05:42 2015 UTC,"There are certain skill sets that will show up immediately in SL. Okafor's low post scoring is the most obvious one, and Mudiay's ability to cut to the basket and dish would be the second. Those were the primary strengths of both of these players and it lets them dominate in what is essentially a pick up basketball game.  Russell's strength was that he was a really good passer, knows where to get his guys the ball and has good court vision. This is a skill that doesn't show up until he develops chemistry with his teammates, and it only looks good in a box score if he has teammates that can do something with the ball once he gets it to them.  Russell will be a great player. But we didn't draft him to be a great pick-up basketball player. We drafted him to be Steve Nash 2.0 and that takes more time."

To have them go through training with the full squad over the summer and come out a bit more organized for pre-season, I can't wait to see how they all grow and gel together.

I've watched both games twice, rewinding often, and if anything I'm more impressed by Russell now than when the Lakers drafted him.  His playmaking, vision and even defense don't always show in the stats.  I wanted Okafor, who will be great in his own right, but Russell truly does look special."

lakers,3d7lz6,notsurewhatiam,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:46:47 2015 UTC,The players tend to play very aggressively because they are playing for contracts.  This tends to lead to more fouls.
lakers,3d7lz6,ControlAgent13,0,Tue Jul 14 05:08:03 2015 UTC,Because there are 10 guys on the court who either have never had to guard NBA level players consistently or simply can't so they commit fouls.
lakers,3d9fz7,admodieus,18,Tue Jul 14 15:18:49 2015 UTC,"No. This sub needs to find some moderation. Half the people seem to think that a couple bad games in SL is proof that we're only going to win 12 games. The other half think that DOE is going to put up 25/15/10 and we are going to sweep through the playoffs. Let's be honest about it: This is a 10-12 seed team this year. Next year, maybe things look a bit different, and I certainly think we'll be better than last year, but we need to be patient and enjoy watching our players develop."
lakers,3d9fz7,aeisenst,2,Tue Jul 14 15:27:39 2015 UTC,You're exactly right. I'll be happy to win say 10-15 more games then last season and watch our rookies develop throughout the year. Way too many people on this sub expecting our rookies to all be stars right away and for Kobe to bounce right back to 2012 Kobe.
lakers,3d9fz7,BABYPUBESS,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:41:00 2015 UTC,"Thank god there's some reasonable folks still here.   I'd even go so far as to say that we may have fewer wins than what you predict, but that this doesn't mean all our draftees were busts.  Wiggins and Clarkson had solid years and their teams still had crap records.   This will be a developmental year for the Lakers. Not too good. Not a lost dead year."
lakers,3d9fz7,amarstan,2,Tue Jul 14 17:26:53 2015 UTC,"Also, Wiggins was trash for the first couple months of the season. He didn't really turn it on until January or so."
lakers,3d9fz7,aeisenst,3,Tue Jul 14 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"Randle isn't going to be anywhere near a 20/10 guy.  People here need to be realistic, and should be happy if he ends up a 12/7 guy at the end of next season.  There is still a chance that Randle's game doesn't end up translating well to the NBA."
lakers,3d9fz7,StealthRUs,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:20:21 2015 UTC,I agree. He spends a heck of a lot of time standing around the perimeter for a guy without a consistent jump shot. He ends up just driving it from the 3 point line and defenses just sag down because he has no shot. I wish he would develop some post moves instead of these dribble moves
lakers,3d9fz7,Kilojoules,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:43:38 2015 UTC,Randle driving and bullying his way to the basket was his bread and butter move in college.   He doesn't have the length or the size to do that in the NBA.  He's gonna have to learn some post moves until his 18 footer becomes more consistent.
lakers,3d9fz7,StealthRUs,-1,Wed Jul 15 04:04:46 2015 UTC,Mouseover to view the metric conversion for this comment
lakers,3d9fz7,ConvertsToMetric,9,Wed Jul 15 04:05:30 2015 UTC,"Playoffs? Are you kidding? Randle is a 20/10 guy? He can't even score in summer league. He hasn't shown any offensive moves that he can use on a consistent bases. DLo is a turnover machine that can't take anyone off the dribble. You need to get playoffs out of your head. Our rookies (randle included) are a lot less NBA-ready then we hoped for. Unless miracles happen in training camp, we're not going to able to rely on them to carry much weight next season."
lakers,3d9fz7,Buckelroo,3,Tue Jul 14 15:25:43 2015 UTC,"Randle is playing his first meaningful basketball in several months, I'll give him a few games with a mashed up roster and a faux coach to figure himself out."
lakers,3d9fz7,Buckelroo,5,Tue Jul 14 15:27:21 2015 UTC,He's a black hole on offense. He sets the laziest picks and his only offensive move is to try a bully people. He's going to need a lot more than training camp to become a 20/10 guy.
lakers,3d9fz7,BABYPUBESS,2,Tue Jul 14 15:31:41 2015 UTC,"I tend to think he's being a little tentative due to that broken leg. It's like when a football player comes back from an injury, it's all about that first hit to make them really understand they're not made of glass."
lakers,3d9fz7,Buckelroo,2,Tue Jul 14 15:42:21 2015 UTC,"He's not being tentative when he plows into the lane whenever he gets the ball. He's being lazy on defense, rebounding and setting screens. That being said, his physical attributes look incredible at times, which gives me hope going forward."
lakers,3d9fz7,Riles26,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:48:05 2015 UTC,He's taking the ball up court and trying to bulldoze people. Doesn't seem to tentative. He's size and lack of serious wingspan are the reasons why he's not finishing at the rim.
lakers,3d9fz7,Symphonia1,2,Tue Jul 14 15:47:11 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your optimism but I believe that some guys just have it, some don't. There is a lot that Randle needs to work on to improve on before we can say he's nba ready. I'm taking this approach with the lakers now: ""I'll believe it when I see it."""
lakers,3d9fz7,_im_on_acid_,2,Tue Jul 14 16:03:30 2015 UTC,The problem I have with this constantly regurgitated response is that ballers can ball. It doesn't matter if they have been off for a day or a year.
lakers,3d9fz7,mes8007,3,Tue Jul 14 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"Adding Roy, Lou and Bass and a handful of rookies isn't the same thing as adding Lebron and Love and expecting instant results.  We are only returning 8 players from last year, of those 8 Randle only played 1 game last year, kelly and Sacre shouldn't see significant minutes this year, kobe and swaggy played less than half a season due to injury, Black and Brown played less than half a season because they spent time on the rockets and in the d-league, and Clarkson played about 1/3 of the season getting consistent minutes.  People need to put more emphasis on roster continuity and developing chemistry.  Hope that this group stays healthy, gels together well, buys into Scott's system and our young players develop.  If that happens we can attract a good free agent or two next summer and then talk playoffs."
lakers,3d9fz7,Ttown1,2,Tue Jul 14 15:59:33 2015 UTC,"Mavs, Kings, Suns, wolves, and OK fucking C all have better rosters than us... Okc and Suns at worst will get the spot."

lakers,3d9fz7,BABYPUBESS,4,Wed Jul 15 00:34:38 2015 UTC,"Pelicans returning strong, and Suns and Kings should both be solid this year. I don't necessarily think Dallas will miss playoffs. They should have Deron Williams, Wes Matthews, Chandler Parsons, Dirk, and Zaza or Mozgov as starting 5. So I think that still keeps them in the playoff discussion. Also, everyone keeps forgetting the Jazz. They came together well at the end of last season and will only be better this year, making them a darkhorse to make the playoffs.  I see the West going something like this.  1-3 seed: Spurs, Warriors, Thunder  4-6 seed: Rockets, Clippers, Grizzlies  7-10 seed: Pelicans, Suns, Mavs, Jazz  11-12 seed: Kings, Lakers  Edit: I know this may seem like a pessimistic view on the Lakers this year, but while our young guys have a ton of potential going forward, I don't think they are ready to consistently contribute to a playoff squad quite yet. Give them a year or two to develop and then the Lakers can be contenders again."

lakers,3d9fz7,BABYPUBESS,2,Tue Jul 14 15:29:37 2015 UTC,I see Cousins coming out and improving on last season. 25/12/3 is reasonable to expect from him and if Rondo can get his head out of his ass even a little they should have a pretty good team.

(Fingers crossed that other teams screw up enough we have a chance for the 8th) Kobe would also need to stay healthy and efficient all season. But as we can see with SL so far, Russell and Randle need sometime to adjust. I don't think we'll be as bad as last season but I'm not expecting us to have much of a chance for a post season attempt."

His main weakpoints are all mental and not physical, meaning with a bit of help from seasoned vets (Nash,Kobe,BScott,Lin?) he was able to see his bad habits and them instilling their trade secrets."

lakers,3d64k6,Holajuwon34,31,Mon Jul 13 20:41:14 2015 UTC,D'Angelo Russell will be great... but his development will be slow and at times very frustrating.
lakers,3d64k6,metrofeed,39,Mon Jul 13 21:07:03 2015 UTC,Byron Scott is the best coach for the lakers right now. It's not often you get the coach to actually care for the organization and not just the team he puts on the floor
lakers,3d64k6,ByTheBeardOfBruce,9,Mon Jul 13 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"I hate people who say they can't win a title with Byron. As if Phil Jackson, Greg Poppavich and Jerry sloan dropped out of the womb as legendary coaches. They needed to grow and become the legendary people they were. I want Byron to grow and be legendary with us."
lakers,3d64k6,Titanosaurus,6,Mon Jul 13 22:12:59 2015 UTC,"Byron Scott is going into his 15th season as a head coach.  For comparison, here are some HC records at the end of their 14th season:    Coach Wins Loss W/L%    Gregg Popovich 736 362 0.670   Jerry Sloan 676 392 0.633   Phil Jackson 832 316 0.725   Byron Scott 437 582 0.429    So yeah, sure none of those legendary coaches happened overnight, but they sure as hell didn't have a losing record by their 15th season."
lakers,3d64k6,Scarlatina,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:46:22 2015 UTC,The problem is also the Lakers refuse to sign a first year head coach. Maybe you have a point.

Clearly with the D12/Kobe/Nash team Phil was best suited for that team composition. Yet at our current roster kinda wonder what MDA would do with this team, the quick showtime run and gun, pick and rolls style of offense. I know this is an unpopular opinion but I just sit and wonder what D'Antoni would do this personnel he could only have dream't to have with the Lakers, instead of the current Princeton offense. Of course I'm behind Byron but what if he took the job at this point of a Laker rebuild."
lakers,3d64k6,TryFaceOn,3,Mon Jul 13 23:30:29 2015 UTC,D'antoni's problem was his stubbornness. He had a 7 man rotation on an aging team.

lakers,3d64k6,westcoastgeek,13,Mon Jul 13 23:26:44 2015 UTC,I'm far more worried about Randle's development than D'Lo (who I think will be fine in time).
lakers,3d64k6,ape_cage,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:58:15 2015 UTC,why though.   Skills can be developed (see Anthony Davis). But you can't teach physical abilities and athleticism (see Lebron). I am very worried bout D'Lo
lakers,3d64k6,remanz,5,Mon Jul 13 23:48:30 2015 UTC,"D'Lo's biggest problems are conditioning and strength, which come with time. That, along with learning how to play in the NBA. Not every point guard needs to be explosive and overly athletic to thrive, just look at Nash. Randle gets tunnel vision quite easily and I think it'll be much harder to convert someone who spent their life as PF into an SF/PF to compensate for being undersized/underlength."
lakers,3d64k6,ape_cage,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:00:01 2015 UTC,"""don't tunnel vision. look for teammates""  I think after 10 games of reminding him. He will get that idea pretty quickly. Tunnel vision is not  a hard thing to shake off. Its not like we are asking him to shoot with left hand or anything. Also, we want him to be aggressive. to always drive towards the basket. I wouldn't discourage him in anyway if he wants to drive.   I don't see D'LO turn into Tony Parker scoring most points in the paint in a season any time soon."
lakers,3d64k6,remanz,4,Tue Jul 14 00:06:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't worry about it for this simple reason: D'Lo's game isn't built around athleticism. Seriously, if you're expecting a Rose/Westbrook freak athlete, you'll be disappointed. That isn't what D'Lo does.  D'Lo is more cerebral and uses his size and body positioning to maintain advantages. D'Lo is already great at working the pick and roll, although right now it's more limited to pick-and-pop. D'Lo can already get to his spots near the elbow against NBA defenders.   He needs to improve his finishing ability around the rim, but that too is a skill. Look at Tony Parker. He's not an insane leaper, but he has the ability to finish around the basket with skill and a soft touch. I have no reason to think that D'Lo can't develop a similar game premised on deadly floaters.  Don't panic. D'Lo ain't even stretch doe."
lakers,3d64k6,StuckFern,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if his game isn't built on athleticism, you pretty much have to have it to be good in this league. How many really good point guards have there been that aren't athletic? I can think of two in Nash and Stockton. Both those guys have all time great passing/handling/shooting. You're basically saying he needs to be the most skilled player in the league to be good because he doesn't have athleticism. On top of that he can't finish with his right hand and turns it over a lot. The comparison to Tony Parker is flawed because    Parker was really quick in his prime  Parker can finish at the rim with both hands.    That's not even talking about defense. In the first two summer league games he's played, his matchup has scored   P. Jackson   15 points  5/11 FG  3/6 3pt  2/2 FT   and  L. Brown  17 points  6/9 FG  1/2 3pt  4/5 FT   These aren't even NBA players, they probably aren't even going to make there team's roster and he's still getting torn apart. It may just be two games, but I don't have any faith in Russell to become an elite player and with the fact that we used the 2nd overall pick on him, he should be."

lakers,3d64k6,MiNdHaBiTs,0,Tue Jul 14 06:28:52 2015 UTC,Having 9 points and 4 assists isn't the point. You completely missed the point of my post if that's what you thought I was getting at.    Parker was the last pick of the first round so it's not like he was expected to do much.  Is that really your expectation for his rookie season? We used the 2nd overall pick to get a 9 points and 4 assists. Are you kidding me? It wasn't about baseline stats. It was about in lack of athleticism holding him back into becoming a good player.

lakers,3d64k6,sunstersun,5,Mon Jul 13 20:58:54 2015 UTC,He stated in his pre draft interviews and even on sports science that he knows his biggest weakness is athleticism. Whether that means his conditioning or burst speed is just as bad well see
lakers,3d64k6,EthosVeg,4,Mon Jul 13 21:57:57 2015 UTC,"it's burst speed, if it was conditioning i wouldn't be concerned at all."
lakers,3d64k6,sunstersun,10,Mon Jul 13 22:00:05 2015 UTC,This has actually been a pretty popular opinion recently...
lakers,3d64k6,Count_Sack_McGee,10,Mon Jul 13 21:35:48 2015 UTC,Not just recently. That was never one of his strengths even before the draft.  His passing and shooting were always his strengths and his athleticism and finishing at the rim were his weaknesses.   Not sure how everyone remembered the positives but forgot the weaknesses.
lakers,3d64k6,amarstan,10,Mon Jul 13 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly, we don't look at AD and say ""wow his 3 point shooting is really lacking..."". I guarantee you the people criticizing Russell would criticize Okafor on his mid range and free throws. There's no pleasing them."
lakers,3d64k6,santokimilktea,12,Mon Jul 13 22:44:36 2015 UTC,"Folks are just looking at box scores and shooting their mouths.  They don't get that this is pre-pre-season basketball and all of Russell's strengths are based on team chemistry. If he knows his guys and where they need the ball, he's better at his job. If he doesn't have chemistry he isn't going to be able to pass well and connect. In contrast, Okafor just needs to do the same thing he's been doing since he was 12 to look good.  If Russell spent the whole game gunning for his own stats he might look better, but that isn't the sort of player we drafted. He'll be fine."
lakers,3d64k6,amarstan,3,Mon Jul 13 22:52:58 2015 UTC,"Yup, love this observation. I think we can use DLo's vision and passing to complement Clarkson's athleticism."
lakers,3d64k6,mjith,3,Mon Jul 13 23:02:00 2015 UTC,"7 turnover, 4-15 shooting, 3 assist isn't good even if he is playing true point guard, and passing all the time.   Its ok to not be athletic. But need to make shots and cut down turn overs. Also conditioning definitely needs to improve. Cant be out of breath as guards.   I think he will be fine. But I am also seeing this is going to take a while for him to develop"
lakers,3d64k6,remanz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:58:15 2015 UTC,You putting up box score stats at the top of your comment and then using it as the basis for your argument just proves my point.   Nobody cares how many passing yards Peyton Manning has in training camp.  Get your head out of the sand and watch the game.
lakers,3d64k6,amarstan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:34:42 2015 UTC,"I watch the game. and he weren't that great. Lack of aggression. Lack of stamina. There is a difference between NOT getting stats and getting bad stats. There is no way to spin the turnover and lack of assist, no matter how you look at it. Stats aren't everything. But it is something. Especially turn overs. every single one of those cost us."
lakers,3d64k6,remanz,2,Tue Jul 14 01:17:43 2015 UTC,Did you not even read my explanation earlier of the lack of assists and higher turnovers? It's like you're just typing without reading.

lakers,3d64k6,remanz,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:35:33 2015 UTC,But there were all those ridiculous harden comparisons before the draft. Harden can get to the hoop and finish. So I get where the disappointment is coming from. Pre draft hype is a helluva drug...
lakers,3d64k6,jedimonkey,2,Tue Jul 14 01:51:51 2015 UTC,It was very unsettling when he caught the ball ahead of the defense in transition and still couldn't finish last game. I really hope he works his ass off to improve his explosiveness because it's just not there naturally
lakers,3d64k6,ItsBiggy,2,Mon Jul 13 21:28:51 2015 UTC,That's because he doesn't. He couldn't get to the paint against good teams in college either
lakers,3d64k6,Kbmakaveli,-3,Mon Jul 13 22:17:03 2015 UTC,"On top of this, he can not jump for shit. Zero hangtime. I thought he had a decent vertical?"
lakers,3d64k6,CHUN_BUNS,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:23:20 2015 UTC,this is the problem with combine or workout verticals.  You can gather and there's nobody around you.  Being able to jump high for a combine drill is much different from in game explosiveness.

I worry drafting Russell over Okafor is a mistake, not because Okafor is better than Russell but because of how incredibly hard its becoming to find a serviceable 5. I mean Enes Kanter just got 70 mil. We might have to give Hibbert 60 or 70 mil just to keep him because there isn't likely a better option next season."

lakers,3d64k6,LukeBoy20,15,Tue Jul 14 15:45:36 2015 UTC,I hope Kobe plays for us until he is 40  Lou Williams was not a great signing   Jordan Clarkson is overrated on this sub  Nick Young is a good role player for us   I'm sad to see Jeremy Lin go  This team will win 35-40 games this year   A superstar player will sign here within the next 2 summers

lakers,3d64k6,awesomobeardo,3,Mon Jul 13 22:42:27 2015 UTC,Wow. I disagree with every statement you made. Well done.
lakers,3d64k6,locallyunknown,6,Mon Jul 13 23:31:39 2015 UTC,"On Thompson and Trudell on ESPN Radio this morning, Trudell was trying to argue (very justifiably) that a focus on analytics and the presence of talent are not ""mutually exclusive,"" a phrase he used probably over 15 times.  However, Thompson kept using, in Trudell's terms, a ""straw man"" argument, saying that talent is what brings FAs to teams (e.g. LMA going to SA, the most talented team), even though Trudell stated that LMA liked the analytics presented by SA and Houston. Even worse, Thompson provided further evidence to debunk the importance of analytics, citing Drew League players, saying that these players don't give a shit about analytics - they just want to go out there and ball. That's a straw man argument if I've ever seen one.  I think that Thompson's mindset - stuck in the past, refusing to acknowledge Trudell's continued emphasis on analytics and talent not being mutually exclusive - is a big factor in limiting the attractiveness of the team to FAs.   Lastly, callers largely backed Thompson, citing examples of talent bringing in FAs. But no one addressed the fact that talent and analytics are not mutually exclusive!!!  Get with the times!!"
lakers,3d64k6,mngo,6,Mon Jul 13 21:00:22 2015 UTC,I agree with you all the way but I want to point out that sports radio shows generally have a framework of two personalities with two different opinions. There's no entertainment factor when the hosts agree on most things. You'll notice Mason & Ireland frequently argue and Mychal Thompson will say the opposite of Trudell nine times out of ten.
lakers,3d64k6,blackbeardboyband,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:20:32 2015 UTC,"True, but I was annoyed that Thompson's argument was a straw man, and that he wasn't acknowledging the fact that the two factors complement each other (e.g. he could've made a stronger point had he argued that analytics don't translate to success, rather than ignoring it completely)"
lakers,3d64k6,mngo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:59:22 2015 UTC,"That's just the way sports radio is. It's not really meant for intelligent people anymore. There's always going to be 1 voice of ""reason"" and another guy that's just mouthing off so that they can please both spectrums of listeners.   To add fire to the flame, oftentimes the people calling in aren't even real. They hire actors to call in and say certain things to further polarize the discussion or focus it on a specific talking point."

lakers,3d64k6,Titanosaurus,5,Mon Jul 13 22:18:11 2015 UTC,"Good point. Yeah,  analytics isn't an either/or proposition. It's just more information. More information is always good. And ultimately it's up to players and coaches (and the front-office) to decide to how much of it to use. And it's naive to think people that use analytics successfully also don't combine it with the human element -- seeing players live,  learning their personality, noticing discrepancies of what the numbers say and what they see.  Farhan Zaidi of the Dodgers, a major analytics genius, even used to have a horn on desk that he'd sound when he felt scouts or analytics guys on his staff focused too hard on the numbers only. I think because he studied the psychological aspects of economics in school, he fully understands that the numbers represent actual people, and only tell one side of the story.  As for players using it, again like in baseball, some players choose to use it and others don't. Someone like Zach Grienke or Brandon McCarthy will pour over sabermetric data to improve their game, someone like Bumgarner won't. For the Lakers, they should cater to the particular needs of players -- some guys will want that analytics info, some guys won't. This is especially important when recruiting -- someone like Carmelo Anthony may want to see pretty pictures in his presentation, while LaMarcus Aldridge wants analytics.  I think the new wave of GMs in baseball are like Moneyball 2.0, where they are the new generation of stat-influenced GMs but now understand the need to combine both new and old ways of running a team. I think we're seeing the same in the NBA, especially with guys like Steve Kerr.  You don't throw out the old ways, and just go with the new -- you gotta embrace both in order to succeed."
lakers,3d64k6,UltraFlyingTurtle,2,Mon Jul 13 21:40:35 2015 UTC,"I think Jeff Katz (Trudell was on his way to Vegas) and Mason are putting too much emphasis on Analytics. The only stats that matter, teams that score the most points after 48 minutes wins the game. Analytics are great for learning more about what you have, supplement the gameplan, but its not something you build off of. If LMA was so unimpressed with the Lakers because we didn't have a good analytics department? That's kinda bullshit."

lakers,3d64k6,blackbeardboyband,9,Mon Jul 13 21:11:50 2015 UTC,"I think it's hilarious to hear fans say they don't want Kobe to play after this year. I mean I get where this idea comes from.. Kobe hasn't played much over the past two seasons while taking up a large chunk of our salary cap. The thing is, Kobe isn't gonna re-sign for $25M a year and keep in mind that JC only emerged after Kobe went down. There are two legit playmaking ball handlers in the starting lineup now, Kobe does not and should not need the ball in his hand for the entire game. I think that there's a good chance he can come back healthy with a smaller load and if he can dominate the mindset to pick his spots he can be highly effective and a huge part of our offense."

Preferably both actually.  I know some say that offering something like a $5 million deal to Kobe is disrespectful, but do you honestly think so? You're supposed to be paid for what you're going to bring to the table, not what you've already done for the organization. Besides, I think with the $300+ million he's earned just from the Lakers (not including endorsements), he and his family won't go hungry anytime soon.  Dirk, Duncan, and Garnett have all taken a lot less for various reasons. Dirk and Duncan did it so that they're team can build a team around them. Garnett did it to be a mentor to the young guys. Either way, I don't think Kobe would do it so that there can be a better team built around him or so he can mentor the youngsters.  Duncan for example has continually taken a lot less. There's a reason why SA is always competitive. Aside from the money aspect, Duncan also took a backseat to Parker. Before, Duncan was option one in Popovich's post-up offense. Now, since Duncan has gotten older, they run a motion offense with Parker being the one initiating the offense. That shows just how selfless not only Duncan, but Ginobili and the rest of the Spurs are too. Take Green for example, he could have really cashed in this season with another team. However, he chose to stay with the Spurs, cause they're a family.  It's been said that Kobe is fine with winning championships as long as he's the one that's the main reason for it. I mean I get it, Jordan was similar in that fashion, but enough is enough."
lakers,3d64k6,ControlAgent13,5,Mon Jul 13 23:35:17 2015 UTC,"You see, I agree with what you said. If Kobe comes back and decides to accept a smaller, less ball dominant role, I'll still wouldn't mind it. But that's the thing, it's Kobe. He won't."

lakers,3d64k6,WhiteAdipose,3,Mon Jul 13 23:37:16 2015 UTC,"He'll help the team this year, as a veteran presence that can mentor the young guys. Beyond that...we know how Kobe plays. He'll get his 25 shots up per game, and he'll score them inefficiently. And to be honest, thats just going to hurt the team, by taking shots away from players. And times last season, the offense was '4 guys watch as Kobe creates a contested two'. Kobe just always has the ball in his hands, and now with D'Lo/Clark/Randle on our roster, it'll only limit their development if he plays past this season.   On a lesser note, there's been noise about how some guys don't want to play with Kobe. While none of us know how true that is, if Kobe even slightly deters potential future free agents, he's done us a disservice, because his time is almost done.   Last note- also, won't Kobe still eat a considerable amount of the cap in the future if he wants to still play? I just don't see him accepting a small salary, especially now the cap is rising."
lakers,3d64k6,CmonTouchIt,5,Mon Jul 13 21:34:28 2015 UTC,"KD has said on numerous occasions that he would love to play with Kobe and anyone like Kobe.

lakers,3d64k6,santokimilktea,0,Mon Jul 13 22:22:07 2015 UTC,"I really don't get why people think KD is coming to LA.  KD wants a ring above all. He's getting paid no matter where he goes. If he comes to LA, who is he going to bring with him to replace Serge Ibaka and Russel Westbrook to help him get that title? The most notable 2016 UFAs are like Joakim Noah and Al Horford... As it stands, the Lakers are way too far from being a title contender to seriously attract KD. All we have is glamour, glitz and potential. With somebody who is the self proclaimed ""servant,"" the glamour and glitz probably isn't something that KD cares all that much about. And the young potential is too risky to really sign a 4-5 year contract for.   Seeing how this years free agency went though, I wouldn't be surprised to see him join the Spurs."

Even if he plays a Ray Allen role he'll be extremely successful and a lot of teams will do anything to get a role player like that even when he's pushing 40.   But notice how I said ""able"". I doubt he'll be happy with being a Ray Allen or KG and retire way before that. But I still think he's going to draw double teams against some of the worse teams in the league."

lakers,3d64k6,ctyau,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:56:25 2015 UTC,I don't agree. Clarkson is amazing off the ball. The speed of his off ball movement and his cutting is superb. He should occasionally initiate the attack but I feel like his progress is better served developing off the ball.
lakers,3d64k6,IHateLifting,2,Tue Jul 14 05:18:38 2015 UTC,"I think Mudiay has the highest ceiling of anyone in this draft and I think he'll end up being the best ""pure point guard"" from the draft.

In reality, No one is perfect and sometimes people make the wrong call or bad stuff happens.  We were never going to attract a significant free agent in free agency.    What veteran superstar wants to sign with a team that is 2 to three years away from being Legit?      Finally,  I want Kobe to keep playing as long as he's able to be effective.   No reason to push him out the door as long as he's still effective at a reasonable price (not a  bullshit 5 million more like a 12 million)"
lakers,3d64k6,PaperDesk,6,Tue Jul 14 01:06:03 2015 UTC,"This team will not win a championship or attract a big name free agent with Kobe as the focal point of the offense. In the Aldridge pitch, he told LA that he saw them existing similar to Kobe and Pau did during their championship runs. While I applaud Kobe's confidence that he can return to 2010 Kobe, no FA player of that stature wants to take a back seat to a 36 y/o kobe. They want to be the man, and Kobe will have to play off of them rather than Kobe being ""the guy."" Only way Kobe wins his elusive 6th ring is if he is part of a Hawks/Spurs system where he is a cog in the machine rather than THE machine. Until he learns that or retires, this franchise can only go so far."

I would kind of maybe agree if say we picked Okafor over Dlo because of our history with bigs, but as it stands right now I'm not too sure.   There are huge incentives for draft picks to stay on their team after their original contract and will be even greater with the cap increase (look at Butler, AD, Lillard, all are staying with their team). I think Russell will definitely have more long term success with the Lakers than Okafor with the 76ers (50% me being a homer and 50% history).  It's a pretty cool discussion though."

lakers,3d64k6,Kbmakaveli,3,Tue Jul 14 05:40:25 2015 UTC,"Russell isn't ever going to be an All-Star and I've thought this before the draft. He's an average athlete at best, can't finish with his right hand, and is extremely over hyped as a play maker. A lot of people like to over look his athleticism and say it's doesn't matter because Steve Nash and John Stockton were great without being great athletes. You're basically saying that Russell is going to have to be one of the best ball handlers/passers/shooters of all time to be an allstar. It is ridiculous to assume he is going to have that level of skill.   [Edit] Sure, down vote me on an unpopular opinion thread. At least try and discuss it with me if you disagree."

Kelly because he won't get minutes here and might on another team.

Idk how to properly describe this, but I've seen guys who've never made noise in the league dominate summer league by scoring in volume, sometimes even efficiently. But its not really translatable because they are trying to get theirs against inferior competition relative to the NBA talent. Russell's passing is beyond what I thought it was. Some of his turnovers were a result of him seeing things that his teammates haven't yet seen. Soon, they too will be on that same page and a step quicker than the other team, and we'll truly see how good D'angelo is.

I never care about whether a young guy can hit shots since to me it comes down to the moves. If you have the moves, the shot will come with experience. I have high hopes for Randle since the swift moves and bully instincts are there, just his finishing needs work. D'angelo's passing and court vision is definitely there, just a bit shaky on his scoring so far."

If Russell struggles with scoring, he can still confidently impact the game in other ways with his passing abilities and defense.  If Russell was more one-dimensional, then you could see a lot of frustration from the player if that single part of his game was shut down.  Very excited about the upcoming season."
lakers,3d2fws,sharkytowers76,7,Mon Jul 13 02:43:18 2015 UTC,This is exactly why I wanted us to draft D'Angelo over Okafor. He's got this X-factor that you just can't teach. Sees plays develop a few steps ahead. It's going to be a joy watching him develop.
lakers,3d2fws,xcimer,5,Mon Jul 13 02:54:39 2015 UTC,He also has an X-factor off the court with his savvy in front of a camera.  For being so young he is so good in the spotlight.  That stuff matters less than on-court stuff but it can kind of play a role in creating a sort of confidence positive feedback loop.  Sort of a manifest destiny sort of thing.
lakers,3d2fws,TuneHD,11,Mon Jul 13 04:20:21 2015 UTC,"Great, great read.  His game is so cerebral, and is a real joy to watch.  I'm glad he spent some time hanging with CP3 before the draft...that's the point guard I'd love him to emulate the most.  CP3 is a little doughy and not particularly athletic, but he's quick and crafty enough to get wherever he wants to be.      D'Angelo's court vision is indeed on another level, and I was really impressed with his defense.  I can't wait to see what he looks like after an entire training camp so he can work on conditioning, handles, etc."
lakers,3d2fws,xcimer,10,Mon Jul 13 01:43:10 2015 UTC,CP3 was definitely athletic when he was younger
lakers,3d2fws,diondrems,2,Mon Jul 13 02:58:18 2015 UTC,"holy shit, how have i never seen that before."
lakers,3d2fws,misterrunon,4,Mon Jul 13 04:07:43 2015 UTC,This is why I've said that the people complaining about russell and even throwing out the word bust do not know anything about basketball. They don't understand the game and know what to even look for.
lakers,3d2fws,augus7,2,Mon Jul 13 03:22:47 2015 UTC,"I'm probably going to get downvoted from saying this, but he has good vision and after the team gets used to one another, the turnover issue should improve. Still, though, that beat writer did not address his lack of ball handling + he hasn't shot well. It hasn't been just these 2 summer league games, but also in practice.   I'm hoping he can improve in those 2 areas. He has to if he wants to live up to the hype."
lakers,3d2fws,sharkytowers76,16,Mon Jul 13 00:41:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed, there is no harm in stating DLo's flaws.  I'm optimistic he can get better in those; shooting and ball handling are easy to improve upon. His defense was a pleasant surprise though doooe, he plays the passing lane well and can strip the ball from other players. Couple that with his rebounding, I'm very happy with our pick."
lakers,3d2fws,misterrunon,12,Mon Jul 13 00:49:10 2015 UTC,"I understand some of the criticisms of Russell (some of which are valid but none of which worry me), but I'm just not seeing a problem with his ball-handling.  This is a very good article and describes perfectly what people should be looking for when analyzing Summer League play."
lakers,3d2fws,shootmans,0,Mon Jul 13 01:00:19 2015 UTC,There were a few times where he dribbled into the double team and ended up turning the ball over. There were other times when the ball slipped from his hand at the top of the key.
lakers,3d2fws,nighthawk88000,16,Mon Jul 13 01:02:14 2015 UTC,He's 19. Turnovers like that are going to happen to 19 year old rookies.
lakers,3d2fws,diondrems,10,Mon Jul 13 01:41:39 2015 UTC,"Could also be nerves. I mean, for 19 yrs old in the NBA, it's kind of hard for these kids to play completely calm and not be nervous."
lakers,3d2fws,ShadyG,8,Mon Jul 13 02:19:26 2015 UTC,You mean he shouldn't come into summer league averaging 35 points on 80 percent shooting with 8 rebounds and 12 assist a game with 0 turnovers?
lakers,3d2fws,jamesdakrn,5,Mon Jul 13 03:24:43 2015 UTC,"Losing the ball to a double team isn't about ball handling, it's about judgement. Good judgement comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment."
lakers,3d2fws,misterrunon,5,Mon Jul 13 12:11:40 2015 UTC,"Nah I'm not worried about his shot at all. He's got a great stroke and his 3s in college means he should soon adjust to the NBA 3 point line. The potential problem comes from his lack of explosiveness to get the separation he needs- until he can get his footwork and lateral quickness to do what he wants he will not beat NBA defenders off the dribble, which could mean trouble for him in the long run. Hopefully he lifts hard lol"
lakers,3d2fws,justgivingsomeadvice,-1,Mon Jul 13 01:51:53 2015 UTC,"I am concerned with his shot. Moving back a few feet could actually make a huge difference. I've seen his shooting in practice and he definitely wasn't hitting them like an elite shooter does. Imo his body does not look squared when he shoots.. his left leg leans forward a bit + he doesn't seem to get a lot of lift. https://youtu.be/aZyGpskCfSA?t=3s   Compare that to this shot, where he's in much closer and his body seems squared towards the basket https://youtu.be/aZyGpskCfSA?t=27s"
lakers,3d2fws,sharkytowers76,6,Mon Jul 13 02:08:08 2015 UTC,"The squaring up to the basket thing is conventional wisdom but it's under heavy debate on whether it's beneficial. I know for me my shoulder gets tense if I square up, so I need to lead with my right shoulder just a bit (I shoot with my right). To be honest, Russell's stroke reminds me of Harden's. I think he has some adjustments to make but as  a 19 year old his shot looks pretty good. He's not gonna be Steph but his free throw percentage in college was already indication of that"
lakers,3d2fws,jamesdakrn,2,Mon Jul 13 03:05:36 2015 UTC,"When I heard he was a shooter the first thing I looked at was his FT%.  Decent, but not otherworldly like a Nash or Curry.  His shot will be fine.  Good call on the Harden stroke.  It is a bit like that."
lakers,3d2fws,justgivingsomeadvice,5,Mon Jul 13 04:17:12 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll be a 50-40-90 guy, but more of consistent 37+% shot and 80% ft. still pretty good. The question is if he could beat guys off the dribble. I really really hope he does a lot of power cleans and snatches lol"
lakers,3d2fws,needmoresleeep,3,Mon Jul 13 05:15:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if you look at Harden's FT numbers in college as a freshman, they were similar. In fact their overall splits were pretty similar, except 2 point shooting:  47.9/41.1/75.6 vs 57.6(!)/40.7/75.4  (2FG%/3FG%/FT%) (D'Lo vs Harden: Note D'Lo shot a lot more 3s overall)  Obviously Harden could finish better (stronger, craftier, and plain better) but the shooting numbers are quite similar. Harden ended up a great shooter, a bit like Kobe where his 3FG% doesn't reflect how good of a shooter he is due to shot selection, so D'Lo hopefully projects optimistically to be that good. But yeah, Curry or Nash he is not."
lakers,3d2fws,Nickk_Jones,-2,Mon Jul 13 05:25:21 2015 UTC,I'm more concerned about his conditioning. He doesn't look like he's in great shape. Makes me wonder about his work ethic. His shot will improve with better conditioning.
lakers,3d2fws,IMjudas,2,Mon Jul 13 04:53:35 2015 UTC,Last thing I'm worried about is his work ethic.
lakers,3d2fws,rtrainer30,2,Mon Jul 13 05:37:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know that his work ethic should be questioned. I think it everything has just added up.  The pre-draft process, the practices before summer league, shoot around then back-to-back games.   The kid has the desire to be great. He has a lot of pressure from himself and fans to be great being the surprise pick at 2. No way this kid slacks. Specially if Kobe takes an interest in this kid and also at the rate that Randle and Clarkson are developing he has no choice but to bust his ass. Just have to give him time."

He'll do well setting up the offense but its up to his teammates to follow through. More interested in Randle tonight than D'Lo, who I think looks fine."
lakers,3d53x2,ape_cage,5,Mon Jul 13 16:37:09 2015 UTC,Nobody predicted 8 Tos that's for sure
lakers,3d53x2,Prince_Aladeen,7,Tue Jul 14 02:56:06 2015 UTC,I'm more looking forward to if Randle can get going today. You could tell he was rusty in the first game. Russell needs to not force so many shots and keep the TOs down
lakers,3d53x2,SPMrFantastic,17,Mon Jul 13 16:32:50 2015 UTC,"In Russell's defense, half his TOs are due to teammates not being ready for his passes. He's also got a few blown assists per a game because Buycks and company are having trouble finishing after he gets them the ball.  Russell wasn't perfect, but he wasn't as bad as people are making him out to have been. He'll be fine."
lakers,3d53x2,amarstan,5,Mon Jul 13 18:13:23 2015 UTC,Agreed. I meant to add in that his assists are mostly down because teammates can't finish or make a shot

lakers,3d53x2,mikemontano,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:58:09 2015 UTC,"Dunno that this will happen but this is what I'd like to see:  Russell being aggressive early, when his legs are the freshest, either off of the pick and roll or in transition. Ideally, he can get Randle involved in the process, which forces the defense to actually respect the rolling big man. From there, he'll have options, either to shoot or find someone else open with a pass.  Also, while highlight reel passes are fun, I'd like to see him be a little more conservative and make the safe pass first. With two games under his belt, hopefully there's a little chemistry now and guys will be more ready for the ball at all times, but it's still on the PG to make sure the guy on the other end is actually in a position to catch it."

lakers,3d3bll,Theoryman101,3,Mon Jul 13 23:03:36 2015 UTC,Stat lines don't show a lot of things.  A good example is the pass to Tarik Black that was perfect but ends in a turnover because Tarik couldn't handle it.  It should have been an assist.  Russell got robbed of several assists because the Lakers players he passed to didn't make the basket.  He led the team in rebounds in the second game as a guard.  That's hustle.  People knock his athleticism but he's sneaky quick:  he doesn't seem like he's that fast until he beats his defender and throws that amazing pass that gets a highlight reel.  I have faith in Russell.  I was one of those guys who wanted Okafor but watching Russell in Summer League erased my doubts.
lakers,3d3bll,Cienes,5,Mon Jul 13 14:19:19 2015 UTC,The fan base isn't used to seeing developing players. It's a double-edged sword from decades of a good product on the floor.

lakers,3d3bll,ravorg,4,Mon Jul 13 07:21:46 2015 UTC,"People don't understand that court vision and passing is an attribute that is harder to obtain than shooting. Shooting is something you can work on everyday during practice, but making the right pass at the right time is something that requires a lot of experience and Russell already has that at a young age. I mean sure, he needs time to adjust to the NBA, but the only player that doesn't is probably okafor and that's why everyone thinks we should have taken him over Russell. There's just so many factors.."
lakers,3d3bll,FreshDiamond,5,Mon Jul 13 09:11:38 2015 UTC,I don't know what comments your referring to but this post is every bit as absurd as the people who freak out about two summer league games. You don't know that he is going to be a stud. High draft picks completely bust all the time. Just because this high draft pick got picked by your favorite team doesn't mean he is immune. There are very promising aspects of his game and there are some concerning things as well. Time will tell everyone needs to chill. Summer league doesn't really mean much but neither does the fact that he is on our bad basketball team.

I think this guy is getting carried away with the hollywood lifestyle, sort of what happened to Lamar Odom when he was with Khloe Kardashian.. he just needs to focus on basketball, the thing that is paying him MILLIONS of dollars  I think him being off our team would be beneficial to both parties, not knocking the dude, he's a baller, but I don't think his head is always in the right place"

Would Nash somehow not break his leg?  Would D12 decide to play pick and roll with Nash?  Would Kobe not tear his achilles?  That was a team that after the ASG, was on fucking tear.  They had some serious momentum right up until Kobe went down.  You could argue that maybe D12 stays with Jackson, but I doubt it.  Clearly him and Kobe/Nash didn't get along."
lakers,3d1cqr,dza4,13,Mon Jul 13 02:33:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah so am I, this post is a bit tongue in cheek. I doubt I'd ever cross his mind again.

lakers,3d1cqr,Paladinoras,4,Sun Jul 12 20:15:45 2015 UTC,"Not re-signing Trevor, Pringles and the fucking Nash trade are the only real unforgivable stuff. Overall, the Jimmy Buss front office era has been successful if you're not exclusively cherry-picking the bad while ignoring the good. If the veto doesn't happen the Lakers would have been contending the past few years.   Young core looks real nice right now."
lakers,3d1cqr,soigotthatgoingforme,4,Sun Jul 12 23:37:26 2015 UTC,"We got Artest for the same money we would've gotten Ariza, and people forget how much Ariza sucked the year after we traded him (playing 37 MPG while shooting 39%...yikes)  Pringles, I can sort of understand because Dr Buss wanted Showtime back, and the Nash trade was something that only looked back in hindsight. Nash was an All-Star just the year before, no one could have known that he would've had a freak accident with Lillard four games into the season which would fuck his season up so badly"
lakers,3d1cqr,shootmans,3,Sun Jul 12 23:45:20 2015 UTC,That's because Houston wanted him to lead the team... We all know that won't work. Ariza was key to the 2009 run and saved our asses against Denver in the playoffs.
lakers,3d1cqr,TheSSUpboat,2,Mon Jul 13 00:25:30 2015 UTC,Lakers are still winning with Ariza instead of Artest and would have been a massive upgrade the years following. And you're being intellectually dishonest when ignoring the fact that Houston tried to make Ariza into something he wasn't (also conveniently ignoring that Artest shot 39% playing next to Kobe/Pau). Ariza flourished in the triangle and rarely ever forced anything.. unlike Ron.
lakers,3d1cqr,shootmans,3,Mon Jul 13 01:49:33 2015 UTC,"Not re-signing Trevor wasn't his bad. Ariza and his agent wanted $7-8 million.  The Lakers offered him as much money as Artest and when they tried to hold out for more, the Lakers decided to look elsewhere.  Plus, I feel that Artest was pivotal in containing Paul Pierce in the finals and had pulled through for Game 7. Source  Pringles wasn't solely a Jim Buss decision.  Jerry Buss made the final call for D'Antoni because he wanted to recreate showtime.  Source  If the Nash trade panned out, we would be claiming that Jim was a god rather than a fraud.  Nash was an all-star the year before he was traded and averaged 12.5 pts/10.7 assists on 53.2% shooting.  He just got an injury that snow balled into multiple injuries afterwards.  The reason the Lakers have been struggling now is because of the front office has not adjusting to the new CBA and the 2011 lockout.  The CP3 veto was probably the worst thing that could've happened to the Lakers, putting the retooling to a halt.  This trade wasn't just terrible because we didn't get CP3, but we ended up getting disgruntled pieces in Pau (who was faced with endless rumors of being traded the rest of his career) and basically ended Odom's career after his Sixth Man of the Year season."
lakers,3d1cqr,dza4,2,Mon Jul 13 01:51:57 2015 UTC,The Lakers went after Artest harder than Trevor.. which was a mistake.   The Celtics showed Ron absolutely no respect as his offense was shit all year and doubled/tripled Kobe with crazy ferocity. Yup he pulled through in game 7 as he should have with all those open looks. Ariza spread the floor much better than Ron and the offense didn't standstill when he touched the ball. The Lakers for sure are winning that series with Ariza and would have been in much better position to contend beyond that.
lakers,3d1cqr,vtechnique,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:02:53 2015 UTC,"The unforgivable sin was Mike Brown.  Nobody knew Nash was going to break his leg in the pre-season.  MDA is one of the most innovative coaches of the game.  The modern era is built around his style of play.  And on top of that, D12 was never going to understand the triangle."
lakers,3d1cqr,dza4,3,Mon Jul 13 02:26:10 2015 UTC,"You should have asked him why he choose D'Antoni over Phil, when Phil was still thinking about it, and we have an aging Kobe on the team."
lakers,3d1cqr,soigotthatgoingforme,3,Sun Jul 12 23:57:58 2015 UTC,Because Phil wanted his Jim's job.

lakers,3d1cqr,rebeltrillionaire,3,Sun Jul 12 19:30:23 2015 UTC,"I just realized I didn't answer part of that. I don't know what way you are meaning ""engaged"" so I'll answer it both ways. He was very engaged in the game, clapping and standing up for good plays. In the conversation, he was as engaged as he possibly could have been, given the circumstance. He had a lot of people asking for autographs, I happened to catch him when no one else was around. A lot of times when you meet a ""celebrity"" they want to sign and get it over with, he was the opposite, even leading the conversation."

lakers,3d1cqr,njain4,0,Sun Jul 12 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand the difference between Jim in his role now, and Jim giving up his VP position. It's not like he's selling his ownership stake.   NYK - GM = Steve Mills but everyone only mentions (Owner) Dolan and (VP) Phil Jackson  This is the full Lakers Staff and Executives. Nobody on that list stands out to me as the figurehead that would really change our fortunes. If we were to get an outsider, I hope it's more than just a big name to appease fans.   So if Jim steps down, he'll still be an owner. Would we really be able to make the distinction if we got a less recognizable name since all these decisions are behind closed doors? Or would we just revert to putting everything on Mitch (when it's good) and out of the corner of our mouths say it's still Jim (when everything's bad)."

One comment. If there's one thing worse than negativity on this board it's all the self righteous fans who feel the need to condemn every person that disagrees with them. We are on a sports board and people are going to have differing opinions, we don't need these posts making ad hominem attacks on the fans of this board. Jesus man, just let other people have their thoughts and if you disagree discuss it with them, rather than getting all mad and making a post about how dumb they are."

More importantly you just can't help yourself on belittling peoples opinions that are not your own. Some people don't like the Princeton offense and think it shouldn't be implemented with this team. They wanted to voice their opinion. Would you rather this sub just be one giant echo chamber that circle jerks non-stop about how fucking awesome we are despite having the 4th worst record?

He just needs to refine them.   He has the size, intelligence and athleticism to guard any of the perimeter positions. He can knock down the open three pointer. He can finish at the rim with either hand on the fast break. He can kick the ball around to the open man.   People love Nance's hustle, and rightly so, but Namce will need to develop his game (specifically a jump shot) to make the sort of lasting impact that Brown is going to have. I see Brown as eventually becoming an Ariza-type of player."
lakers,3d2pat,amarstan,4,Mon Jul 13 05:06:50 2015 UTC,"I would say Nance will be the steal of the draft by seasons end (barring injury), if anyone. I'd be surprised to see brown get more than 10 mins/gm this season. I watched Nance at Wyoming a lot, he can hit a midrange shot, especially on a catch and shoot. But he's more of a rim finisher anyway. Nba ready Imo.  Long term, Nance will have a good career. Hopefully brown does too, but Ariza might be a little high of a ceiling."
lakers,3d2pat,Reply_Hazy,2,Mon Jul 13 07:41:58 2015 UTC,"We'll see. Hopefully we're both right. Problem with Nance is that he looked awfully athletic playing against dudes in Wyoming, but that isn't exactly the best competition.  Brown played at Stanford, which while not the best college league, is still a considerably level of completion better than anything Nance was playing against.  Brown has the tools that translate to a core team player in the NBA. Whereas Nance is really just a hustle guy right now. Those guys are great to have when they're on their rookie deals, but unless the can develop core abilities (3 point shooting, top end rebounding and team defense, pick and roll finishing, etc.) they don't do well by their second contract.   But who knows, Nance could have a 3 point shot by training camp if he works at it."
lakers,3d2pat,amarstan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:15:48 2015 UTC,"Yep I agree with the Ariza comparison. I've been watching Brown on defense throughout SL and the dude is really good. He understands where he needs to be on defense and can keep most guys in front of him.   He has a tendency to disappear on offense which I don't like, but defensively he's really good."
lakers,3d2pat,Citizen_of_Atlantis,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:48:22 2015 UTC,once randle and Russell get more reps we're going to be talking about how much incoming talent the lakers got this year in the future. so many solid dudes in one draft.
lakers,3d2pat,thehumangenius23,11,Tue Jul 14 08:10:48 2015 UTC,"So far he's been looking good, he just needs more time on the court to get better and find his rhythm. His defense showed flashes out excellence already."
lakers,3d2pat,wanderfound,11,Mon Jul 13 01:29:24 2015 UTC,The things that stuck out to me the most were a few of his awesome on-ball defensive plays.
lakers,3d2pat,SlightlyRyan,6,Mon Jul 13 01:38:49 2015 UTC,I like him a lot. Love his shot and his D. All of our rookies look promising.
lakers,3d2pat,nikkus,9,Mon Jul 13 01:31:20 2015 UTC,"Hope he becomes Trevor Ariza. Defense is definitely there, his 3 looks good and should start falling with time. Needs better chemistry with JC and D'angelo, not sure about his athleticism yet."
lakers,3d2pat,TuneHD,9,Mon Jul 13 03:00:25 2015 UTC,Like him a lot. He for sure can be the next Bruce Bowen.
lakers,3d2pat,pbreal01,8,Mon Jul 13 01:32:06 2015 UTC,Idk why you're being downvoted because Bowen is not really a superstar and he was just that great role player that helps the team win on both ends of the floor. I was impressed by his defense yesterday and I could see this comparison panning out.
lakers,3d2pat,TheAsianMamba,2,Mon Jul 13 02:23:39 2015 UTC,Not a lot of touches but quietly shooting very well. Hustles on defense and looks like he's well on his path to being a lock down defender. Not sure why he's not getting more minutes. Perhaps the Lakers want to throw some other guys out there to see if they want to sign them as well. Brown looks a bit more polished than Russell imho... Russell is just more talented.
lakers,3d2pat,unix04,2,Mon Jul 13 02:32:02 2015 UTC,He's solid. Both defensively and offensively. Knows his role and sticks to it. Hasn't made any stupid plays so far either.
lakers,3d2pat,mister_greyMATTER,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:55:15 2015 UTC,He looks decent - it's still a toss up whether he makes it in the league or not. I think Larry is the better prospect.
lakers,3d2pat,misterrunon,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:40:43 2015 UTC,"He's played very solid defense so far. Hasn't really stood out that much offensively, but his time will come once he gets more touches. I'm glad we're taking the risk and giving him the opportunity to be our backup SF instead of Wesley Johnson, had we re-signed him. Looking forward to seeing what he does in training camp and pre-season."
lakers,3d2pat,Remote95,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:48:35 2015 UTC,"From what little I've seen, he looks pretty good too. I think one cool thing about having such a young, raw team is that we should have a lot of hungry players with chips on their shoulders and ready and willing to prove themselves. Maybe we won't have the wins but I think one encouraging thing is that we'll show a lot of heart."
lakers,3d2pat,joeinthebox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:54:03 2015 UTC,"Looks like he'll have the highest percentage 3 of the bunch and good defense to go with it, he'll be on the squad for sure this year and looks like he's got what it takes mentally and basketball wise to make it"
lakers,3d2pat,Donkeykongalan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:06:30 2015 UTC,"He's got a ton of potential. I've watched a couple videos on him, and I think he needs to work on his handle. That'll let him drive to the rim when opponents close out on him. Shooters like Klay Thompson didn't have that ability to drive like that when they first came in either. Being very optimistic, I think that's his ceiling."
lakers,3d2pat,hooperextraordinare,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:55:01 2015 UTC,If he can be for.us what grant hill was for phoenox he's earned his spot. Spot up 3s and some nice perimeter d to not give up easy shots and i'm happy. If he could be. 8pt 6rb 2ast 2 stl a game type guy that's ideal i think
lakers,3d2pat,teo1315,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:01:13 2015 UTC,He needs to start consitently hitting the three ball.    Like his potential though.  But I liked Ebanks and Caracter too so what do I know

lakers,3d2pat,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"Strokes it and plays good D, what more can you ask? He just needs to up the intensity and sustain it, which'll come with time and conditioning, but overall very optimistic.  Not sure he has the foot speed to check the Westbrooks and Butlers just yet but that can be improved with dedication in the gym. I hope he buckles down and puts the work in; he can be a great 10+ year vet if he does."

lakers,3d1iew,anyonebutme,22,Sun Jul 12 19:25:08 2015 UTC,"Right before this happened I was telling a friend to keep an eye on him during every play. He's constantly moving around and going after every rebound. And boom, right when I said that he had this put-back dunk.  If he plays like this during the regular season, he's gonna get some good minutes. You cant not play a player that gives this much effort. You dont have to run plays for him, he's not a defensive liability, he'll get you extra possessions, he's atheltic, and above all he seems like he embraces that role. He knows that thats the kind of player he needs to be to have an NBA career.  I'm excited for this dude."
lakers,3d1iew,Gabe681,7,Sun Jul 12 21:52:11 2015 UTC,"Same here. He's got a huge chip on his shoulder coming into the league, it seems. His 4 years of NCAA experience have really helped his game. And like you said, I'm glad he's been able to find and learn his role in the NBA as opposed to being the guy at Wyoming.   We're going to have a lot of hustle and energy coming from 4 of our big men in Randle, Nance Jr., Bass & Black. I'm stoked."

Also the kid is surely going to be on the roster and is likely going to be with Randle and Russell for a while, so why not keep them together. My last point is both he and Russell have to get acostumed with each other and why not in the SL?"

lakers,3d093y,TuneHD,4,Sun Jul 12 18:12:18 2015 UTC,I think it's good for him from a leader standpoint and confidence booster.
lakers,3d093y,numbnutsnz,4,Sun Jul 12 15:29:10 2015 UTC,"No No NO. Russell and Clarkson need to iron out the kinks now playing summer league, not during the first 10 games of the season. They are young, healthy and their bodies can handle it. Keep him out there."

lakers,3d093y,Donkeykongalan,2,Sun Jul 12 15:18:50 2015 UTC,This is pretty much his whole team playing in the SL. Why wouldn't he play with them and get used to being the big dog around them and letting them see how it goes. This is where the Clarkson/Laker future starts. Can't wait for his first few 50pt game streaks.
lakers,3d093y,anyonebutme,4,Sun Jul 12 17:50:01 2015 UTC,Not being sarcastic. Honest question. Do you really believe Clarkson is capable of a few or even multiple 50pt games?

And i wouldn't be worried about JC's conditioning hes the only guy out there that looks like hes ready to play in a real nba game.  Besiddes summer league is a place for young players to improve on their game. Yes JC has been our best scorer but he hasnt play maked the same way we saw him creat for others last year. I want to see him get D'Lo going in the offense.

lakers,3d093y,joeinthebox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:45 2015 UTC,"I have to echo all the comments that say that Clarkson needs to play as much as possible alongside Russell so they can hit the ground running in the pre-season and the season itself.  And, besides, Clarkson is fun to watch."

And you have to realize how important it is for him to be on the floor with his future core. Especially Russell and Randle. I'm glad he's out there. You're underestimating the importance of players getting minutes together. I want him to take a leadership role and get his confidence up.

lakers,3d58kq,spudwinkle,4,Mon Jul 13 18:33:16 2015 UTC,"I see a whole lot of Magic in this kid (pun intended). Tall guard, court vision, charisma, good rebounder for a guard, not very athletic but crafty, doesnt jump much on his shot, most importantly can pass the rock! I can go on, but you get my point. Slow start to Summer League, but I'm not worried (at least just yet lol)."
lakers,3d58kq,TheRealMelvinGibson,2,Mon Jul 13 17:05:21 2015 UTC,He sees the floor extremely well at this level. I just hope his teammates are prepared to catch these passes. During summer league T.Black was wide open a couple of times and it resulted in a fumbled catch or a turnover.
lakers,3d58kq,jasterisfett,2,Mon Jul 13 17:10:07 2015 UTC,"Chemistry will improve that though, and Tarik will learn to keep his hands in the ready position because like Magic, Russell will get it to you especially when you least expect it (thats when the defense doesn't expect it either)"
lakers,3d2bc6,rejectx,28,Sun Jul 12 23:21:07 2015 UTC,"Byron Scott, to me, is not a bad coach. And I don't think he's as out-of-touch as people might think he is.  In many ways, Scott is probably the best coach for the Lakers to take us into the next era. The post-Jerry Buss/Kobe era.  First off, think about how rough the last 4 years have been:   Apr. 2011: Mike Brown hired. Dec. 2011: Chris Paul trade rejected. Jul. 2012: Nash signed. Aug. 2012: Dwight acquired. Nov. 2012: Brown fired; Mike D'Antoni hired. Feb. 2013: Dr. Jerry Buss passes away. Apr. 2013: Kobe ruptures achilles tendon. Jul. 2013: Dwight signs with Houston. Dec. 2013: Kobe fractures knee. Apr. 2014: D'Antoni resigns. Jul. 2014: Byron Scott hired. Oct. 2014: Julius Randle breaks leg.   All these hits have pretty much come one right after the other.  So, without Dr. Buss as the head of state, coaching instability, an aging superstar like Kobe, a poor hire in D'Antoni, etc.  I believe Byron Scott brings a sort of stability to the Lakers and almost a security blanket for the ownership and the front office.  Scott grew up in Inglewood, won Championships with the Lakers, worked for the Lakers television network and pretty much bleeds Purple and Gold.  He loves the Lakers. He understands the Lakers. And he knows what needs to be done:   Absorb the criticism from the fans and the media. Guide the young players in the ways of the Lakers. Offer confidence to our remaining superstar Kobe. And is an experienced enough coach who also believes in hard work and can help establish a tough work ethic in his young players.   Scott will always know to say the right things, knows how to represent the Lakers, and it's pretty much one less thing for the Lakers front office and ownership to worry about. And he loves the Lakers enough to be patient enough to grind through the tough times.  And, I'm not naive, I realize that we probably didn't have too many options for head coach. Most were probably too inexperienced (Scott at least has name recognition) while others were too experienced to take on a rebuilding project.  My expectations for Scott?  Well, I'm not necessarily putting my expectations solely in terms of wins-and-losses per se.  I think a lot of my expectations have to do with how our players play: Do they show heart? Do they show grit? Do they work hard? Are they growing from game to game? Week to week? Month to month?  If I see all that, then I will be happy with the season and I'm sure more wins will come our way as well.  Ultimately, I think Byron Scott is in a great position: If he doesn't do well over the next season or two, the Lakers can say, ""Hey, thanks for helping us rebuild, we really appreciate it"" and another coach can inherit an exciting young team that may need fresh blood to get them going.  Or, if Scott does well? Great. Keep it going.  And that's what I remind myself to do as well. Just keep going with the Lakers and we'll get there."
lakers,3d2bc6,joeinthebox,4,Mon Jul 13 02:23:10 2015 UTC,"We need more of this around here. It often feels like people around here actually think they know more about basketball than Byron Scott. They rip him and say he is awful and site things like the Lin Davis combo was the best thing we had going why doesn't dumb ass byron play them together, and countless others situations like that. Do people actually think Byron Scott can't see that? Of course he knows he was coaching to lose. Yet he still instilled so much grit and pride in his players that he put a watchable product on the floor. The lakers were in a ton of very competitive games last year because Byron got the most out of his guys. Then he had to figure out ways to lose late. Byron did about as good a job tanking as you can as a head coach.  I am very excited to see what happens when we try to win this year. I have plenty of questions about Byron still obviously. He is an old school basketball guy in demeanor and in his beliefs about the game. Perhaps too old school. He comes off out of touch and archaic to me. He doesn't like shooting 3s and he doesn't like pick and roll basketball. I don't either but there has to be a middle ground. I don't fully buy into the analytical movement but it has its place in the game. It seems Byron puts zero faith in it at all. I am a Byron fan and I think he did a great job last season. He takes a lot of heat that I think is unjustified but I don't know if he is the right guy for the job I won't have a definitive opinion on this until next year is over. I am looking forward to the year though"
lakers,3d2bc6,FreshDiamond,6,Mon Jul 13 05:37:26 2015 UTC,"I think both offensive and defensive ratings will improve, but it's still a process. I'd love to see us fight for the last playoff spot but realistically it probably won't happen. I'm not quite sure how majority of this sub feels about Byron, but these next few seasons will be telling for his coaching ability. The talent is there."
lakers,3d2bc6,kiahmed,2,Sun Jul 12 23:49:02 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with Byron for another year or two, but I don't think he's gonna be on the sidelines for our next championship. Even if we're better offensively and defensively, he's not the coach that has league-leading schemes. First of all he has to embrace the 3, and princeton has to go.. of course those are just my opinions though.  As for actual expectations... Still a bottom ranked defense (around 20th), maybe middle of the pack offense. A 41-41 season doesn't seem out of reach if everyone's healthy and contributing as much as we think they can. But if we're around 15th offensively and defensively, I'll be happy."
lakers,3d2bc6,PatronSaintOfUpdog,2,Mon Jul 13 01:51:00 2015 UTC,"Scott is not an elite coach, but I hope he figures it out. Madsen mentioned running Princeton sets in the 6ers game. If Scott can master the offense and teach it well, he should have a solid foundation as a coach. He will be learning a lot too in the next couple years. I hope he embraces this opportunity like the rookies do. He's got room to grow into a good coach"
lakers,3d2bc6,unix04,2,Mon Jul 13 02:41:10 2015 UTC,"Big season for Byron. A lot of us were disappointed with the way we played basketball last season, but the crappiness of our roster shrouded how much of it was down to Scott's coaching. This season he has a lot more to work with. We're still going to be below average, but it's a roster that is absolutely good enough to put a competitive brand of basketball on the floor every night. This is Byron's chance to show that he's ready to coach a current generation basketball club. Hopefully he can prove doubters like myself wrong."
lakers,3d2bc6,Rhyme_Pays,2,Mon Jul 13 01:35:41 2015 UTC,"It will be his 2nd year with a bit more talent than year before.   More future talent than last year.  This year's team isn't much better than last year's team.  We're loaded with rookies, and rookies lose games in droves.  Anybody who thinks Scott will have done a terrible job because when we don't win 35 games next season is wrong.  This team is built to lose a lot."
lakers,3d2bc6,StealthRUs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:31:33 2015 UTC,"Expect some growing pains.  There are four rookies:  D. Russell, L. Nance Jr, A. Brown, and R. Upshaw.  There are two sophomores that are essentially rookies due to limited play experience:  J. Randle and J. Brown.  There are two more sophomores:  Jordan Clarkson and Tarik Black.  Kobe Bryant, by himself, has more NBA seasons of experience than over half our roster combined.  Byron Scott has a brand new team that doesn't even resemble the team he got last year.  Most of the players he used last year are gone. As a result, he's going to be essentially starting over and teaching this new roster his system.  With so many rookies that need basic NBA fundamentals, this is a tall order.  Nick Young, Ryan Kelly, and Robert Sacre are the three I expect to get moved, cut, or traded.  Sacre is 5th on the depth chart (Bass and Black will start before he will).  Kelly is 5th on the depth chart (Nance will start before he does).  Where does Nick Young fit in the roster?  Clarkson is starting at SG and Williams is his backup plus J. Brown needs minutes to develop.  Kobe is starting at SF and he has two backups that need minutes (Nance and A. Brown) to develop for the future."

Only things I care about next season are Kobe and the young guys.  Byron's garbage.  Everything the modern NBA is, he doesn't want to do, which is just incomprehensible to me.  D'Antoni was hated for his defense but his scrub team running Kendall Marshall and Manny Harris had the same exact D rating as Byron's scrub team while playing a faster pace.  I don't get why this coach keeps getting a free pass."

lakers,3cz4ue,stevebeyten,6,Sun Jul 12 03:05:19 2015 UTC,"Scott said he could see Russell at the 1, Clarkson at the 2, Kobe at the 3, or Clarkson coming off the bench but with starter minutes."
lakers,3cz4ue,RufusPFunkerdale,2,Sun Jul 12 03:08:27 2015 UTC,Uhh the plan seems to be to move Kobe to the 3 and start both. But I'm fairly skeptical....
lakers,3cz4ue,stevebeyten,9,Sun Jul 12 03:13:22 2015 UTC,"Take pressure off of Randle and Russell so they aren't thrown into the fire.

lakers,3cz4ue,hanni90,-29,Sun Jul 12 02:57:01 2015 UTC,"lakers should have picked okafor. dude is going to be an absolute beast. clarkson and okafor would have been a thing of beauty to watch. clarkson is going to be a superstar i believe in a couple of years. and okafor certainly has the potential to be a super star big man. remember when the lakers had the superstar guard + superstar bigman combination? remember how many championships that brought? but of course, lakers' front office decided to go full retarded and skip out on okafor."
lakers,3cz4ue,NicDwolfwood,15,Sun Jul 12 04:52:52 2015 UTC,"No Question Okafor is gonna be really good  Lakers just went with the player that fills a need they've had the past 15 years, which is a true point guard. Russell needs time to sharpen his skills. Point is the hardest position to play in the NBA, it takes time, no need to panic yet"
lakers,3cz4ue,hanni90,-16,Sun Jul 12 05:55:50 2015 UTC,"but you already had a great guard in clarkson. pairing him with okafor and allowing the two to grow together, along with randle, would have been great for the lakers."
lakers,3cz4ue,NicDwolfwood,8,Sun Jul 12 04:21:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, but Clarkson is more of a 2 guard. I think Summer League has shown that   I just think its too soon to fucking panic. athleticism cant improve, but explosiveness can and also the princeton offense Lakers are running is a tough system to learn, which is why the team looks very stagnant at times."
lakers,3cz4ue,hanni90,-8,Sun Jul 12 02:42:19 2015 UTC,yeah...why the fuck are they running a princeton offense? i hope the lakers' coaching staff doesn't go full retard.
lakers,3cz4ue,NicDwolfwood,8,Sun Jul 12 02:48:56 2015 UTC,"Because that is Byron's system, that is what the Lakers have been running since he became coach. that and a little triangle, but not too much"

lakers,3cz4ue,NicDwolfwood,4,Sun Jul 12 02:57:04 2015 UTC,"Im not a fan of the offense myself. Lakers tried the Princeton with Mike Brown and it was a stagnant fucking offense  Lakers offense wasnt too bad last season though.  I dont agree with them running it with these rookies though, pretty complex system to learn on the fly. I think that is why the offense has looked stagnant in these 2 summer league games. too much standing around when players dont have the ball. There has to be more movement and cutting"
lakers,3cz4ue,rebeltrillionaire,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:01:36 2015 UTC,"Call it what you want. Every team runs the same plays 59% of the time. It's up to the players though to actually set viable screen, read a defense, make cuts, and ISO against mismatches."

lakers,3cz4ue,Edmuresay,14,Sun Jul 12 03:06:50 2015 UTC,"It's summer league. It's generally a bunch of dudes who have little practice and have never played together.

lakers,3cz4ue,hanni90,-13,Sun Jul 12 02:55:28 2015 UTC,"actually they could have. when they got dwight and nash, they should have hired phil who would have implemented a system that best fit the team as a whole and managed the different egos, which he's a genius at. so, yeah, the FO really fucked up on hiring d'antoni. the lakers' FO coaching hires have been utterly atrocious."
lakers,3cz4ue,CeeBeast,6,Sun Jul 12 03:08:11 2015 UTC,"That team without a healthy Kobe would've been destroyed in the playoffs whether they were coached by Phil Jackson or a random fan in the crowd. Nash and Howard battled injuries too, and even when healthy Nash was showing his age and Howard wasn't performing great offensively. Hiring Phil would've probably won them a few more games, but they wouldn't have competed for a title without a healthy Kobe. The FO is great, they are great at drafting and really good with acquiring talent through trades. Don't let one non-hire make them bad in your mind."

After the lockout the dude fired like 1/2 of the Lakers organization because ""they were in Phil's camp"", he fired all the scouts and hired his high school buddies which was a disaster. Mitch also threatened to leave, shit was pretty bad, but it looks like it's been mostly cleaned up. I have to say though, the only coach I thought was a completely stupid decision was Pringles."

He seems to be trying to be careful and make the right plays..In my opinion he's thinking too much..As time goes and he gets used to the players around him and the schemes it'll come more natural and we'll be able to see him show why he was #2."

Besides, I believe Russell will want to become better, so he's not going to give up.  I mean, wanting him to be like Curry and Harden at this stage?  That's a fucking pipe dream.  Same goes for him in his rookie season.  This whole season I don't expect him to play like a prime player.  If he becomes an All-Star, it will happen eventually, just not anytime soon."

Lottery picks and established young players like Clarkson just use it to shake off some rust and get ready for the season. And Sure ass hell they aint giving their 100% there

lakers,3czqhx,TuneHD,21,Sun Jul 12 13:16:45 2015 UTC,I'm a Sixers fan and we had this discussion after Okafor's bad game yesterday. He'll have better summer league games.
lakers,3czqhx,Trainwrek,10,Sun Jul 12 08:45:38 2015 UTC,"It's a little different though. We all know jahs post game was there and even in bad games he shows it. He shows explosivenrss and intelligence.   You still see that potential with dangelo with his passes and work off of pnr, but also there's some concern on explosiveness. Its such a big part of the pg position. At this moment he can't really drive off the pnr. Just pops. Even with the defensive concern of jah, you have his length. So with us theres that concern of whether he's d'40 or d'15.  That being said, his intuition of pnr is still very advanced. What he does still counts as penetration, he just needs to learn where to pass it or get more reliable teammates to pass it to. He needs to get that vision down so that he can eventually move to the basket with the threat of an assist."

lakers,3czqhx,FuriousFlex,34,Sun Jul 12 19:39:21 2015 UTC,"exactly man, people are jumping to conclusions on this kid WAY TO EARLY, he needs time to develop just like any 19year old baller,  I'm getting tired of these fans wanting him to produce great numbers right away, give him time"
lakers,3czqhx,suitntiekid18,31,Sun Jul 12 06:46:56 2015 UTC,You don't win ROY in Summer League. I'd rather him struggle now and humble him a bit. It will mean more for his future development to have early growing pains that will help him develop a strong work ethic. See Clarkson.
lakers,3czqhx,AranciataExcess,7,Sun Jul 12 06:49:28 2015 UTC,growing pains that will help him develop a strong work ethic. See Clarkson.   ^ +1
lakers,3czqhx,lufty574,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:33:03 2015 UTC,This is a really good thing to mention
lakers,3czqhx,BoAKwon,8,Sun Jul 12 23:00:23 2015 UTC,"If Summer League determined how good a player would be, Clarkson wouldn't be nearly as good as he is now. I'm pretty happy with the way Russell has been playing. His passes are amazing :D"
lakers,3czqhx,thranduil-,8,Sun Jul 12 08:48:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to call him a bust given the incredibly small sample size of games he's played and the little preparation he's had in adjusting to the speed of the NBA, particularly at the PG position. It is definitely different being thrown in as a franchise point guard (especially because he's only 19) vs. being thrown in as franchise a big man (ie. Towns/Okafor). That being said, it is completely fair to say that as a Lakers fan his performance has been rather underwhelming. Days before the draft, during the draft, and the weeks leading up to SL all we've heard were people raving about Russell and how he was going to bring showtime back to LA, safe to say that hasn't happened yet. Now, does this mean he's a bust and will not improve? Absolutely not, I firmly believe he will adjust his game and play at a very high level in the pros, it will just take a little longer than Lakers fans hoped. He's going to be a very good player, I truly believe that, but because the Lakers have been in the dump the last few seasons in terms of success, expectations for Russell have been a little bit exaggerated. It will take time and I can't for when he does get to playing at his best, but until then calling him the next Stephen Curry, or an elite PG, is just as unfair as calling him a bust."
lakers,3czqhx,Theingloriousak2,15,Sun Jul 12 07:59:54 2015 UTC,He had 14-8-3 (led the team in reb/assists) played good d again  He made bad passes + guys just weren't ready for them  He had a bad shooting night  He looked tired too  http://youtu.be/gCOPQL36SZQ
lakers,3czqhx,Theingloriousak2,13,Sun Jul 12 06:47:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. People don't understand that he hasn't played competitively since March Madness and is an entirely new, faster game in the NBA compared to college. On the 2nd night of a back-to-back no less for his first series! Anyone would be tired!"
lakers,3czqhx,Unknownmamba,2,Sun Jul 12 06:50:58 2015 UTC,I do think it may be best for him (Randle too) to start off on the bench
lakers,3czqhx,Theingloriousak2,7,Sun Jul 12 06:55:18 2015 UTC,"I'd rather they start, meaningless games to let them adapt to the NBA pace and give them some confidence."
lakers,3czqhx,Unknownmamba,2,Sun Jul 12 07:00:05 2015 UTC,I think they'll gain more confidence succeeding against twos   And eventually they can get to where clarkson got last year
lakers,3czqhx,Theingloriousak2,3,Sun Jul 12 07:11:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say yes, but for the regular season. These SL games the twos are Dleague or lower level and Druss and Randle are both lottery picks, they need to hang with similar talent. Clarkson was a second round pick, not a top 10 pick like these guys. It's good for them to play against people that aren't seasoned like them, let them play backup veterans in preseason and regular season, SL is different though."
lakers,3czqhx,Unknownmamba,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:21:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah I meant reg season they'd be on the bench  Sl and even pre I'd start them, but not in the first two months of the season"
lakers,3czqhx,Bigpierce64,2,Sun Jul 12 07:29:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, I misread you, thought we were talking about SL. B.Scott will make them earn it so I don't think that'll be an issue if they're ready they're ready. If they're not getting 20 mins+ a game then I think we have problems...."
lakers,3czqhx,hibby_,-2,Sun Jul 12 07:31:51 2015 UTC,Vegas will do that to freshly signed rookies.  I'll be partying with him tonight . I'll make sure he doesn't go to hard do he's good for monday. Don't worry boys.
lakers,3czqhx,LifelongRedditor,5,Sun Jul 12 16:45:25 2015 UTC,Are you guys really judging rookie after two SUMMER LEAGUE games?
lakers,3czqhx,lal24mvp,2,Sun Jul 12 07:44:48 2015 UTC,Yeah they are and they're showing how fucking ridiculous this sub can be at times.
lakers,3czqhx,redundantPOINT,3,Sun Jul 12 09:55:14 2015 UTC,Being at the game actually DLo looked pretty good considering he had limited practice and he's playing with new faces. His passes are thing of beauty! JC and Randle look real good they bulked up this summer.
lakers,3czqhx,xcimer,2,Sun Jul 12 07:40:29 2015 UTC,"I expect him to shoot about 40% in the league.   He's longer than the avg pg, but is less explosive and doesn't use his size to his advantage enough yet.   PGs usually have the hardest time transitioning from college and I don't think Russell would be an exception.   He'll be smooth and show flashes like he's done already. But it'll take time.   I like how he doesn't force anything and he really looks like a smooth player that'll play the game as is presented to him."
lakers,3czqhx,CHUN_BUNS,7,Sun Jul 12 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"My take on D'Lo:  He doesn't seem to have that prototypical ""NBA Body"" yet, and does seem slow.  I'm a bit disappointed in his handles too...it seemed like he couldn't regularly get past his man under single coverage beyond the 3 pt line.  I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little worried, but that doesn't mean I'm not also optimistic.  I still think he'll be great for us.  His court vision is insane, and his passes are all on point (except for that one to A-Brown on the fast break).  A lot of his turnovers were passes coming in hot (but still on point) so the guys weren't ready for them.  Training camp will fix this I would imagine."
lakers,3czqhx,Akvc8,5,Sun Jul 12 07:36:13 2015 UTC,I don't know why you're being downvoted. That's a legitimate take.
lakers,3czqhx,bickingbackbeingbool,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:44:49 2015 UTC,"He's not in NBA shape, yet  He hasn't played actual basketball since he was at Ohio state, and workouts aren't the same as actually playing  Also I felt he was a bit slow on purpose, actually. If you notice he got past his man (Sampson who's played in the league for a few years now..serviceable defender) when he did want to without issue. So it's not that. He seems to still be trying to gauge the pace of the game, which is understandable and control the tempo.   One thing that can help him overcome all these issues he is said to have by the critics (pace/high dribble): is his ability to play in space.  He understands where defenders are around him and not just in front of him, and he hovers around the high post after the PNR giving him multiple outlets (pass to corner three, 15-20 ft jumper, or generate space in the post by forcing the 4/5 to come up and defend the potential shot)   He has OUTSTANDING feel (reminds me of Brandon Roy..guy is just smooth). He'll be fine by training camp"
lakers,3czqhx,lolxddavid,0,Sun Jul 12 20:13:02 2015 UTC,I completely agree. A lot of his turnovers were contributed to the fact that his teammates were not ready.
lakers,3czqhx,Seiko673,4,Sun Jul 12 21:12:10 2015 UTC,I think everyone is bombing him because he's playing with a bunch of guys who are rookies and unproven while he's a lottery pick where many expect him to win ROY. Just wait a bit and see what happens
lakers,3czqhx,Knighthonor,2,Sun Jul 12 08:26:51 2015 UTC,"Wiggins last year took a while before he finally got it. I remember back in November posts were saying ""haha Wiggins is a bust, Parker has ROTY"" etc, and he only started performing well in around January. But when Wiggins performed he performed.  It's summer league right now and July and I think Russell has a lot of time to improve. You could see the frustration in his eyes, and I believe he has that personality to use that frustration as motivation.  I think if he keeps his athleticism up, that combined with his intelligence/IQ, he can be a very dangerous PG and that makes me excited."
lakers,3czqhx,akeytoasafe,4,Sun Jul 12 11:20:14 2015 UTC,Wait I am confused. didnt watch the game. But is this the same guy yall saying was bust? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1rObe4aKRQ  fill me out.. whats all this bust talk from?
lakers,3czqhx,ashishvp,7,Sun Jul 12 07:11:04 2015 UTC,He didn't have 28/12/7 so everybody is going to crying that he's not displaying HOF material in his 2nd pro game.
lakers,3czqhx,khighyle,2,Sun Jul 12 07:45:24 2015 UTC,Actually he got like 8 boards today. More than HOF player status ;D
lakers,3czqhx,SlipClutch,2,Sun Jul 12 11:41:22 2015 UTC,He is lightyears ahead of some of these guys on the team. Some of the guys are making him not look as good by standing around/ taking too long to start pin downs and cuts etc. He is fucking good man
lakers,3czqhx,FuriousFlex,2,Sun Jul 12 09:27:32 2015 UTC,There is no way he busts with the work ethic and natural skills he has. Nash is one of the top PGs of all time and he isn't athletic nor tall/long. Russ will be fine.
lakers,3czqhx,der_ninong,2,Sun Jul 12 09:55:02 2015 UTC,"People think Russel is going to be our savior right away... Let me break it to you folks. NO! Not right now, but hopefully in a few years he matures to his full potential. When I watched him play these 2 games, he know how to PASS! he can shoot too. He needs time to gel and build that confidence up."
lakers,3czqhx,BecauseGodardSaidSo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:39:51 2015 UTC,"his first 2 games are actually impressive, at this point i see his worst case scenario becoming an andre miller-like player"
lakers,3czqhx,megavino,2,Sun Jul 12 15:33:07 2015 UTC,"That's an awful scenario considering he was picked at 2, compounded by the fact that we skipped Okafor to get him... I don't want Andre Miller :("
lakers,3czqhx,ShaneMichaelOfficial,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:11:31 2015 UTC,This is a non issue. It's the second summer league game. I saw glimpses of greatness with some of the passes.
lakers,3czqhx,Lakersno834,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"Anybody saying he's a bust is an idiot, but I am definitely a little concerned, he made some really dumb plays, attacking the basket, and the ball just goes flying in to the stands.. turnover. i must have seen that happen like 4 or 5 times  If he can work on that then once he gets a little older he'll be a beast"
lakers,3czqhx,PatronSaintOfUpdog,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:13:13 2015 UTC,"You also have to keep in mind that he is not necessarily surrounded by the best players. If you put him with Kobe, Hibbert, Bass and veteran players who know where to be on the court and how to get maximum out of a player of his talents."
lakers,3czqhx,vandiger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly I just want to see him dominate a game or two. I know he'll be a good player, he's too smart and skilled not to be. His passes being off doesn't bother me, that's fixable. His shot will get better too. I hope to god he can be quicker than he's been, but even that can be changed with the right workout."
lakers,3czqhx,anyonebutme,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:36:28 2015 UTC,He looks like a PG that can get triple doubles easily. I noticed he rebounds really well.
lakers,3czqhx,ACPhila,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:28:07 2015 UTC,As he was coming out of college and early in his career the many insiders said Steph Curry was too slow to ever be effective in the NBA. D'Angelo will be fine.
lakers,3czqhx,dalas3322,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:17:24 2015 UTC,"sixer fan here as well. Russell will be a great player, any lakers fan starting to freak out because of summer league is hilarious. he needs to get in the weight room work on driving with his right hand and just continue to improve his jumper and he'll be fine. You cant teach the passing he has. He was probably pressing and tired from not being in basketball shape b/c Okafor was playing well."

lakers,3czqhx,Dardariel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:13:07 2015 UTC,slow start? hes looked fine to me for a kid whos barely got a week of practice and playing with people he just met i think hes doing great dont look to much into summer league play it really dont mean much just enjoy being able to watch basketball again. given time to get used to his teammates get stronger get used to the daily grind of the NBA he will be a great player nowhere to go but up for this kid him randle clarkson will be a scary trio for the lakers heres hoping the lakers can find a way to keep all 3 of these guys together long term cus once they all 3 become all star players itll be hard to keep them all
lakers,3czqhx,danielsilva12345,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:51:54 2015 UTC,"In college, D'Angelo understood the game at a higher level than everyone else on the floor. That was his gift. Now he's on another level and he has to master the game and he'll be one of those guys that everyone says has the highest basketball IQ. But it'll probably take time like it did for Steve Nash."
lakers,3czqhx,kerby720,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:16:39 2015 UTC,"i'm a sixers fan, and we had this exact same discussion when okafor played sub par against utah in summer league, don't worry he'll be fine  his shooting and passing ability will translate extremeley well"
lakers,3czqhx,GOATLin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:59:16 2015 UTC,"Patience is needed when evaluating Russell's game. Like others have said he's only 19. Even Kobe was airballing 3's during the playoffs his first couple of years. Plus you can't really compare Russell's seemingly raw game compared to Nance's and Brown's. First off cause Russell is being asked to run the offense which is more responsibility. Also, Nance Jr. and Brown, though they are rookies, spent 4 years in college. Those two are already 22, so they're quite a bit more matured and ""seasoned"" than Russell is. Same with Clarkson actually, he came into the league as a 22 year old so he wasn't as raw either. Russell's game will come, but he will be making mistakes as the season progresses. The important thing is we've seen flashes of what he can bring to the table."
lakers,3czqhx,RockmanNeo,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"People need to chill the fuck out. Like many players, he'll need screens to get past a lot of elite defenders. That's fine. He will increase his endurance and leg strength. The issue I see is his confidence as Byron Scott runs his shit offense and continually sends the kid out there to go one on one when that's never going to be his game.   Russell needs a structured offense to succeed. That's his strength. Instead, we got Byron's whatever you wanna call it offense."
lakers,3czqhx,changerrs,0,Sun Jul 12 08:12:52 2015 UTC,He just needs to stretch first doe. He'll be alright.
lakers,3czqhx,ashishvp,0,Sun Jul 12 10:15:01 2015 UTC,"but he has never had to play a competitive back-to-back in his career up to this point.   really? you dont think when he was in high school he wasnt playing 3? 4? 5? games a weekend? come on. (i understand those are not the same level as these games, but still)  but I do agree with everything else you said."
lakers,3czqhx,bmarshall12,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:24:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he probably played a few back to backs before, but not against this level of talent, for this physical a game, and for this fast-paced a game. That, and his conditioning isn't there since these are his first games since March."
lakers,3czqhx,kobe_bryant24,0,Sun Jul 12 14:17:16 2015 UTC,"Sure hes not ""Westbrook Explosive"", but who is?    Clarkson  Other than that. Fair points. Im pretty sure he just needs a month or two working hard in the gym and he'll be good to go"
lakers,3czqhx,Chilled_Penguin,8,Sun Jul 12 11:36:34 2015 UTC,I love Clarkson but Westbrook is on a whole different level when it comes to explosiveness. Only pre injury rose could rival him imo
lakers,3czqhx,GabrielRodriguez115,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:52:20 2015 UTC,lavine is the same class but he just isn't as good as the other two.
lakers,3czqhx,sayheykid24,4,Mon Jul 13 13:34:26 2015 UTC,"Clarkson is a good athlete, but Westbrook has 19 year old LeBron athleticism. He might be the most athletic PG ever. Clarkson is no where near that stratosphere as an athlete."
lakers,3czqhx,GabrielRodriguez115,0,Sun Jul 12 14:31:32 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping he gains the ability to shot accurately from the 3 it would pair well with Clarkson being able to go up to the post. With his already great passing ability a great 3p% would make him like a cp3/curry packed into one. He doesn't need to be explosive to be great imo may not be the best comparison but look at Duncan now vs Kobe now, Duncan has age much better since he just has pure basketball skill vs the athleticism that Kobe owned back in his prime. I'm not worried about russel at all because he didn't even stretch doe"
lakers,3czqhx,uniy64,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:26:59 2015 UTC,He does have that ability.
lakers,3czqhx,RyanLaFalce,0,Sun Jul 12 13:17:57 2015 UTC,I mean like at the level of curry and Thompson (or a little lower)
lakers,3czqhx,powderblue17,0,Sun Jul 12 16:57:38 2015 UTC,i have another guess. The Randle injury last year may have taught Lakers a lesson and they are telling Russell to take it easy and don't hush into the pace. I think he is trying to catch up with the speed and doesn't want catch a quick injury before the new season.
lakers,3czqhx,manolo88,0,Sun Jul 12 12:36:09 2015 UTC,"I loved his pass on a backdoor cut. I forgot who it was passed to, but looked so beautiful."

lakers,3czqhx,BecauseGodardSaidSo,0,Mon Jul 13 23:28:50 2015 UTC,"Even though statistically he had a bad game, I still thought he looked good.  His passing was great, a lot of his turnovers came from his teammates not knowing he can make passes like that.  Also, he looks like a floor general out there. We haven't had that in a PG in a while.  I'm excited, I'm not sure why people are panicking."
lakers,3czqhx,Iyace,0,Sun Jul 12 15:02:52 2015 UTC,"I think anyone is tripping if they don't think Russel was the right pick for us. I trust in Jerry West. Dude has crazy b-ball IQ. Passing, shooting and creating. He's going to be great for us."

lakers,3d05by,mralln,6,Sun Jul 12 10:52:38 2015 UTC,"Bynum had much more offensive game than Upshaw currently does, but if you're talking strictly defense then yeah, they're comparable"
lakers,3d05by,the_wheyfinder,5,Sun Jul 12 15:11:26 2015 UTC,Not to mention Bynum could impact the game just as well or better defensively when engaged. Especially pre injuries. If upshaw can be near Bynum talent levels I would be ecstatic
lakers,3d05by,GoingBackToMyWays,0,Sun Jul 12 22:05:39 2015 UTC,"Does he?  I know Bynum was good in the post baby work and good footwork -- besides his size I Dk what else I can credit him with ---   I see upshaw can actually run the floor and be involved in the break -- I also seen he had that turn around jumper over okafer. Not sure Bynum could have pulled that off --- I would also take his performance right now with a grain of salt bc he hasn't really played basketball this year with all his trouble ----   But footwork can improve -- he's improved his foul shooting n I've seen him knock down a few that had to be 18 feet.   I'm not sure what Bynum had that we can't get more from in upshaw.   And I love Bynum, reps where I'm from"
lakers,3d05by,DoctorJared,12,Sun Jul 12 15:20:33 2015 UTC,"If Upshaw can give us half of what Bynum did he's a huge steal. If he gives us 100% of what Bynum did he'd be an undrafted all-star, something that has happened 1 time in league history. I don't expect that from Upshaw but I think he can be someone who absolutely contributes, especially on the defensive end. His game isn't really comparable with Bynum in my opinion though"
lakers,3d05by,needmoresleeep,2,Sun Jul 12 18:04:04 2015 UTC,"That's interesting would love to entertain that idea -- shaw as an undrafted all-star --  not impressed by his range, turn around jumper or ability to run the floor for easy baskets ?      Are we saying it would be physical limitations or mental limitations that prevented him from reaching that level?  Like he would have to become the backup center hibbert and maybe eventually a starter if the spots open next year ?     I guess I see his body type and play as more Anthony Davis or KG than Shaq or Bynum    Figured we have yet to see the best of Shaw with his shady college career.   Of course if he's got no mental he won't make it - but Jordan hill was able to turn it around as a LAL so maybe the culture is there ?  He certainly has a higher upside than Jordan hill right ?  Maybe even seems more athletic and productive than hibbert once he's back in shape"
lakers,3d05by,drinks_alone,3,Sun Jul 12 18:40:23 2015 UTC,I'm also excited for Anthony Brown. He shot 44% from 3-pt range in college and has defensive potential. He is the kind of chess piece that you need to complement your stars.   I'm looking forward to seeing all of these young guys develop.
lakers,3d05by,makesterriblejokes,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:20:45 2015 UTC,i feel like he doesn't get the love he should be getting
lakers,3d05by,PaulKr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:05:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, but it's probably more that he's going to be a solid role player while our other young guys are showing upside that could be more than that."
lakers,3d05by,makesterriblejokes,3,Tue Jul 14 00:07:58 2015 UTC,"I'm in. There are worries though - D'Angelo is really slow coming off picks and in transition, can't finish in paint, really needs that Steve Nash layup/floater game, Randle is the exact same player he was last year(was rehabing all year), so we shouldn't just assume that he will be a starter from game 1, Tarik can't guard anyone without fouling the shit out of them, few other minor things. But all in all we're headed in the right direction."
lakers,3d05by,PunTasTick,2,Sun Jul 12 13:11:43 2015 UTC,"True but a lot of that is exclusive to summer league?  Like DLR is probably doing more thinking than playing at this point -- -- also looks as if he could be in better shape needs the nba body like --- Julius is in better shape but clearly has not played enough actual games to get any of rhythm that we see in clarkson --- but how much can 5 games in a row do for him? Wondering what we'll see tonight -- I think of Black as a similar role as exactly that, using up fouls n mucking it up for the benefit of his teammates"

lakers,3d11j0,spudwinkle,7,Sun Jul 12 18:56:46 2015 UTC,"We are enjoying it, but we also care about our team and our players and how they develop. We want to see them play whenever possible, so we are creating discussions about how their current play is and how the overall team is being conducted. If you are unable to participate in these conversations due to a lack of maturity or caring towards the Lakers, then it seems like you already know where the door is."

lakers,3d07s0,drewbagel423,10,Sun Jul 12 13:51:45 2015 UTC,Marc Gasol was also part of that trade
lakers,3d07s0,bluelip_,10,Sun Jul 12 13:59:48 2015 UTC,"Eh....at the time, he was just Pau's fat younger brother who never played much. Sure, he turned into a beast, but there was no way to know that at the time. Kwame was the big ""get"" for Memphis at the time."
lakers,3d07s0,gasgiant405,3,Sun Jul 12 15:19:56 2015 UTC,wasn't kwame an expiring contract?

lakers,3d07s0,Titanosaurus,4,Sun Jul 12 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"Not true at all.  I don't know why this gets tossed around. After we drafted him I watched his progress overseas.  Marc was MVP of one of the best leagues outside of the NBA (before we traded him).    Marc was recognized as the best player in Europe hands down.  If Marc was drafted that year (and not the year prior) many forecast he would have been a high lottery pick.   This is a quote from draft express the fall after we drafted him, ""Blogging Through Europe (Part 2: Belgium) November 28, 2007 Gasol on the other hand looks like an absolute steal for the Lakers, having drafted him in the late second round (#48) this past June. His skill level is looking better and better these days, knocking down a 3-pointer calmly, hitting a pretty turnaround jumper, and doing a terrific job moving off the ball and creating space for his post-mate Vroman to operate. He’s a team player who really knows how to pass the ball and is looking much more comfortable in his own skin than we ever remembered him. He also utilized his size very nicely both on the glass and inside the paint, making his presence felt here and altering quite a few Charleroi shots. In short, we’re talking about an absolute stud at this level. It’s still not 100% clear that he’s athletic enough to play substantial minutes in today’s NBA, especially early on, but to land a player this big with this kind of skill level and basketball IQ is an absolute coup. He might be the best big man in the ACB these days, which is saying an awful lot.  From DraftExpress.com http://www.draftexpress.com/#ixzz3fhrsfLfL http://www.draftexpress.com"""
lakers,3d07s0,Bballreasons,2,Sun Jul 12 19:15:39 2015 UTC,There is also a stigma attached to foreign players. It's why the Knicks got killed for porzingis. A top foreign prospect is not valued as highly as a top American. Regardless that trade was still a steal and Pau was a better player than Marc is now.
lakers,3d07s0,FreshDiamond,2,Mon Jul 13 06:04:22 2015 UTC,"Okay, but one was a proven NBA player and one was some kid in Europe."
lakers,3d07s0,JimmyHasASmallDick,4,Sun Jul 12 21:45:27 2015 UTC,Marc Gasol was not the same player then he is today

lakers,3d07s0,PaperDesk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:58:50 2015 UTC,Pau helped give the Lakers 2 championships. The timing was perfect for that trade with Kobe still in peak form. Marc right now wouldn't help as much as Pau in 2008-2010.
lakers,3d07s0,ArcticFunk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:37:30 2015 UTC,"And keeping up with the idea that free agency is a crapshoot and maybe overrated. We were able to land Shaq way back when, but nothing significant since, nor anything significant before then either."
lakers,3d07s0,Titanosaurus,2,Sun Jul 12 14:54:56 2015 UTC,Artest was a FA pick up

lakers,3d07s0,Titanosaurus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:28:38 2015 UTC,"Artest was the only reason we won a ring in 2010. His resume shows he was pretty fucking good. He carried the Kings to the playoffs all alone and nearly eliminated San Antonio himself. He went to the Rockets and they instantly became title contenders. I think you're discounting Metta a little too much. If he had his head on straight, he would have been paid more than the 6.5 million the Lakers gave him annually"
lakers,3d07s0,FuckTheClippers,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:31:46 2015 UTC,"No, I'm discounting free agency in general. It's the little signings. Look at the lakers now, we don't sign LMA, DJ or even get a meeting with Greg monroe; and the talking heads claim the lakers have an F grade off season. But the little signings like artest kept us a championship contender in 2010."
lakers,3d07s0,Titanosaurus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:38:14 2015 UTC,"I think you're discounting MWP signing on to the defending champions. He was an integral part of the team, and a damn good player, but the core group at the time was pretty solid."

lakers,3d07s0,TuneHD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:00:04 2015 UTC,"Mitch has made good and bad moves.  I wouldn't say he was an amazing GM but he isn't a bad one.  But, Kwame for Pau was the Grizz owners idea - he didn't want Odom and rejected the first trade that Mitch and the Memphis GM had setup (Odom for Pau).  The owner wanted cap space instead.  Walton and #1 for Sessions - we had to add a #1 for Cleveland to take Walton and Sessions only last half a year and choked badly in the playoffs.  The bigger problem was Mitch giving Walton a 5 year extension to being with.  Cook and Evans for Ariza was a great trade.  Orlando thought Cooks 3 point shooting would help open the floor for Dwight.  But the Lakers got the best player in that deal by far."
lakers,3d07s0,ControlAgent13,2,Sun Jul 12 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"Walton was playing some really good basketball when he signed the extension. Also, the deal wasn't even a bad one. It was like 5 years for 30 million or something like that, right?"
lakers,3d07s0,JimmyHasASmallDick,12,Sun Jul 12 21:47:10 2015 UTC,"Mitch is a great gm, he's just not the best FA recruiter. He's a bit dry and montonous, not exactly the type of personality to win over 28 year old guys. However, I think he's starting to put together a roster that is reminiscent of what we had in the mid 90s. Accumulating assets like jones, nick, elden, ced, peeler, lynch, vlade that you can see having some real value to teams in the next several years"
lakers,3d07s0,Laker_Junkie,8,Sun Jul 12 14:04:53 2015 UTC,Free agents will come when the team starts getting better. You don't see players going to developing teams.

lakers,3d07s0,crammotron,9,Sun Jul 12 17:35:58 2015 UTC,Lets be honest.  Bucks are way ahead of Lakers at this point.  With a piece like Monroe he really fills a need and they should start trending upwards.
lakers,3d07s0,Mattrix2,2,Sun Jul 12 17:58:25 2015 UTC,Monroe is not a player you build around lol
lakers,3d07s0,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Sun Jul 12 17:37:40 2015 UTC,"""You don't see players going to developing teams"""
lakers,3d07s0,crammotron,2,Sun Jul 12 17:38:44 2015 UTC,Wasn't replying to that statement. I'm saying Monroe isn't a guy you build around.
lakers,3d07s0,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Sun Jul 12 17:41:11 2015 UTC,"They don't have to they have the Greek freak and Jabari Parker. He just happens to fill a huge need for them at the moment. The Bucks play pretty good defense and like to run. When they are forced to play in the half court they cannot score. That is why Monroe was ""maxed"". It's a year where max contracts aren't really a big deal. The bucks know Jabari and the freak are there future. Greg just fills an immediate need"
lakers,3d07s0,FreshDiamond,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:10:06 2015 UTC,When was that the argument?

lakers,3d07s0,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:01:39 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's implied that he was talking about star FAs. It's not significant that Monroe is going to the bucks because he's not star. Same way that robin Lopez going to the Knicks isnt significant or Tyson chandler going to the Suns isn't significant.
lakers,3d07s0,ravorg,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:06:59 2015 UTC,"And just to talk about those assets, those are INCREDIBLE contracts this summer. Very attractive and tradeable"
lakers,3d07s0,dendenmoooshi,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:08:23 2015 UTC,I really loved Mitch scouting and trading moves. The only thing I can complain about is not landing a big name player in free agency lately which is disappointing.
lakers,3d07s0,shortalbert,4,Sun Jul 12 13:31:11 2015 UTC,"Do you really think we'd be better off if we had signed Melo?  Or DJ?  LMA was never really interested, this isn't the type of franchise he wants to play on.  Do you really think LA had a chance to steal DJ from the Clippers? Melo is the only ""big name"" free agent in the last couple years that we had a real shot at and it turns out he wanted more money than we could offer him.  Melo didn't choose NYK because Mitch blew it, he chose NYK because they offered him a bigger salary than we are allowed to and he is too stupid to recognize that he would make more money overall by playing in LA.  That wasn't Mitch's fault.  I am so sick of the complaining about Mitch on this subreddit."
lakers,3d07s0,aveydey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:51:08 2015 UTC,"I think Melo just cares more about being in New York. If he wanted to win he'd go to the Bulls, if he wanted to increase his brand, he'd go to the Lakers."
lakers,3d07s0,TuneHD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:02:02 2015 UTC,He took like 125 million dollar deal from New York. Phil laid out something like 5 different salary choices for Melo that would allow him cap flexibility and Melo chose the maximum amount of money for himself.
lakers,3d07s0,aveydey,2,Sun Jul 12 15:29:48 2015 UTC,What's wrong with that though? You're going to sit there and tell me everybody needs to take paycuts if they want to win? The front office isn't doing a very good job if they need people to take less to win.
lakers,3d07s0,TuneHD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:25:46 2015 UTC,"Nobody asked Melo to take less. The Lakers offered him the maximum salary they were allowed to offer, plus a reality show for his wife.  The Knicks were able to offer more because of the rules of the CBA.  I think you need to brush up on your CBA before you pass judgements"
lakers,3d07s0,aveydey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:45:16 2015 UTC,What does that have to do with anything I said?
lakers,3d07s0,TuneHD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:58:41 2015 UTC,"You said I think people need to take paycuts if they want to win, I'm telling you the Lakers didn't ask anyone to take a pay cut.  Maybe you replied to the wrong person or something."
lakers,3d07s0,aveydey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:02:22 2015 UTC,How many more years without landing an impact free agent until his job is at jeopardy?
lakers,3d07s0,crammotron,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:37:41 2015 UTC,"Mitch has never been about landing impact free agents, he has always been about making game changing trades."
lakers,3d07s0,aveydey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:29:37 2015 UTC,I guess you're right...but with the team basically selling fans on all this cap space you would think they would have to start landing someone...  How many years can they go without landing anyone?
lakers,3d07s0,crammotron,2,Sun Jul 12 18:59:15 2015 UTC,Next summer the Lakers can offer KD anything he wants. He can come here and bring any player(s) he wants and the Lakers can afford it in addition to having a solid core already existing.  I predict Lakers land KD next summer. Tag me.
lakers,3d07s0,aveydey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:12:27 2015 UTC,Why would KD want to come to the Lakers... We don't have a strong enough foundation to build a contending team on. There are no other marquee unrestricted free agents next summer except like Jordan Clarkson..
lakers,3d07s0,WhiteAdipose,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:39:27 2015 UTC,"It's clear players want to play with good players now. With the salary cap and max deals the only thing that separates teams are their rosters.

lakers,3d07s0,suntropical,1 point,Mon Jul 13 10:45:01 2015 UTC,People BEEN underestimating Mitch. He's the most savvy GM in the NBA.
lakers,3d07s0,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:36:20 2015 UTC,"You guys realize that Mitch has put together a roster before to compete and win championships....  So everyone needs to relax and enjoy the processes of the rebuilding. Since we got royalty fked by Stern and Dwight pussied out it backfired us into having to go into rebuild mode. We are going to have a solid young core moving forward that will compete and hopefully they ball out so free agencies in the future will look at our roster and say ""If I come to LA I can win now!"" then we got the cap space and BAM we in it again boys."
lakers,3d07s0,FuriousFlex,0,Sun Jul 12 19:48:56 2015 UTC,"the ron artest move was bad.  The Lakers had just won 65 games and a championship with Ariza who he basically swapped for Artest. (same contracts). That was a big mistake. Also The Malone and Payton signings backfired. Payton was an especially bad fit- huge ego, needed the ball, and his defense had declined. Malone was hurt that entire year."
lakers,3d07s0,LakeshowAA24,3,Mon Jul 13 00:03:13 2015 UTC,"if malone didn't get a freak injury during the finals, we would have won that.  Those laker teams had no defensive PFs, and Malone matched up well with rasheed"
lakers,3d07s0,ByTheBeardOfBruce,-1,Mon Jul 13 02:44:09 2015 UTC,"the Lakers were consistently successful for around 30 years   So, not to put to fine a point on this, but no titles from 88-00 (12 years) and 02-09 (7 years). Everyone has downtime, and as a Lakers fan for life I dont give a shit about being 'better', I give a shit about winning period.  We have zero idea what this team is capable of honestly. Sit back and see where it lands, but know we arent competing for a title this year, and likely wont for another 3-5. Which is sad for Kobe, but thats life in the NBA."
lakers,3d07s0,Risar,3,Sun Jul 12 17:38:28 2015 UTC,"If winning a championship is the only measure for success, then 29 teams fail every year. Mitch can't be better than 29 other GMs every year."
lakers,3d07s0,misterrunon,0,Sun Jul 12 21:27:56 2015 UTC,"I still can't figure out why people been down on him. He's been amazing for us and was mentored by Jerry West, who was almost amazing for us. You can't have a homerun deal every year that makes us runaway favorites for the title.  That said, he's done great for us and will continue to do so. He's playing chess while the rest of the league is playing checkers. Soon enough he'll make a move that will have the entire league hating on us and multiple owners trying to write the commissioner about how we did it."
lakers,3czn3k,shockmister,3,Sun Jul 12 05:55:26 2015 UTC,"So I didn't get to watch the game, just these highlights and this is what I took away from it. What do you think?  Love clarkson and nance. JC is better than anyone in summer league and nance is looking like a great athlete energy guy. We haven't had that in a while.   The stuff they showed from Russell looked good. He made some of his patented weird pull ups and had 2 nice passes but it's very concerning that a guy who's so revered for his passing only got 3 assists. I've also read he just looked slow.   Where was randle? Did he not play?  Okafor had one move. It's effective, but every time he got the ball in the post, it was that cross to the left and spin back to the right for a leaning lay up. Defenders will pick up on that so I hope he doesn't rely too heavily on it in the big boy games or its getting swatted. A lot."
lakers,3czn3k,The_Lion_Jumped,5,Sun Jul 12 15:30:25 2015 UTC,"Randle was resting. They are going to bring him on carefully and slowly.  Okafor definitely has more than one move though man, we don't have to insult him to prop up Russell."
lakers,3czn3k,LauranceFuller,2,Sun Jul 12 15:32:20 2015 UTC,"I wasn't insulting okafor, the highlight just showed him using that same move. And I definitely wasn't saying it in anyway related to Russ. I know he has other moves, I watched him in college use a plethora of moves. My point was, if he continues to use the same one over and over again, as the highlight was showing, it won't go well."
lakers,3czn3k,The_Lion_Jumped,3,Sun Jul 12 15:44:55 2015 UTC,You're right; Nance looked like he was waiting for it on his block.
lakers,3czn3k,MeridianKnight,3,Sun Jul 12 23:54:56 2015 UTC,Russell's passing is insane. Just beautiful.
lakers,3czn3k,aeisenst,3,Sun Jul 12 14:13:08 2015 UTC,He had so many near perfect passes that the recipient just wasn't ready. He had one pass that barely made it through like three Wolves and bounced off Upshaw I think.
lakers,3czn3k,tylerbird,4,Sun Jul 12 20:28:14 2015 UTC,D'lo looked a little slow tonight
lakers,3czn3k,SplashAndDash,10,Sun Jul 12 06:30:10 2015 UTC,"on the bright side, he lead the team in rebounds."
lakers,3czn3k,lars5,0,Sun Jul 12 07:01:51 2015 UTC,True. Gonna bet he is just slow because it's the second of a back to back and he just signed a million dollar contract while staying in Las Vegas. Lol kid probably had a little fun last night.
lakers,3czn3k,SplashAndDash,2,Sun Jul 12 07:49:40 2015 UTC,Went to the game tonight. After the big nance block did everyone see the CRAZY travel by jakhar Simpson? The area went crazy when that sequence of events happened. Might be the best travel of all time. He didn't dribble and went from the 3 pt line to a dunk attempt
lakers,3czn3k,Brait002,1 point,Sun Jul 12 08:39:14 2015 UTC,"Went to the game yesterday, and just watched these highlights rn. Video makes Russell look 10x's better than he actually played. Forced so many passes/shots after each time Okafor scored in an attempt to not get shown up.   Still like Russell, still think he shot is wet, and he just needs to get comfortable with the NBA three--all his shots from college 3 were money--but in person, it really seemed like he was uncomfortable and 1 step behind everyone else."

He isn't naturally a freak athlete, his potential and upside lies in his size and playmaking, besides it's not like the  roster is constituted for run and gun tempo. The kid is going have some growing pains naturally."
lakers,3czf56,redundantPOINT,15,Sun Jul 12 16:47:02 2015 UTC,Damn Morrison was  still playing in the summer league in 2012? He was drafted in 06.
lakers,3czf56,statikr3aper,3,Sun Jul 12 04:39:16 2015 UTC,That's why this is a moot stat.   Veterans have such an advantage in summer league... I remember Bo outlaw averaged 20/10 all the time.   Russell is a 19 yo rookie pg.   The same people claiming he's a bust would probably have said the same thing about kobe after his rookie year.

lakers,3czf56,gobias83,8,Sun Jul 12 04:46:25 2015 UTC,"I agree. For both Russ and Randle for that matter. It's been historically proven that Summer League is not an accurate measure of talent and career in the NBA. DLo can pass the hell out of the ball and that's what important. He is only going to improve physically. Many great PGs aren't extremely athletic. Nash/Curry/Stockton/Kidd etc. They all can pass like 2K and DLo has the size.   Randle, despite his poor finishing, was getting by everyone no matter who was in front. The rest will come. I am extremely happy and optimistic at Randle's fitness and agility especially coming off a leg injury.   Of course JC has been a different monster since Nash worked out with him. Brown and Nance are exactly what we need, a role Wes Johnson hasn't been able to fill.  Don't put so much on 1 SUMMER LEAGUE game. Not even preseason. Watch them improve game by game and be optimistic about the future!"
lakers,3czf56,KennethFresno,3,Sun Jul 12 04:32:08 2015 UTC,Summer league is made for guys like Upshaw who were undrafted to show their game and get a contract

lakers,3czf56,_FreshG,3,Sun Jul 12 04:26:55 2015 UTC,Judging a players future based on summer league is even more retarded than judging a teams success based on preseason.

lakers,3czf56,TheRealMelvinGibson,-2,Sun Jul 12 04:33:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know if he's going to bust, but I see a lot of holes in his game - his handles are nowhere near as good as we thought, and his shooting has been abysmal. The passing will get better with experience, but the 2 other facets.. we'll have to wait and see."
lakers,3czf56,muchachomalo,-4,Sun Jul 12 09:05:48 2015 UTC,Hate to be that guy but I knew he was a bust when he cried in March.  Still wish he would have done something though.

lakers,3czf56,muchachomalo,0,Mon Jul 13 04:17:36 2015 UTC,I would gladly link you but I am on mobile.  Google search Adam Morrison crying.  He started crying before the game was over against ucla in the sweet 16.  Nothing wrong with crying when you lose but play the game out at least.
lakers,3czf56,TheRealMelvinGibson,2,Mon Jul 13 04:26:44 2015 UTC,"How was that any indication of his future in the league? It was his last year there. I would have been incredibly frustrated too. Don't think I would have cried, but I definitely would have been crushed by the way that played out. I'm pretty competitive and had a game or two pulled out from under me in highschool in similar fashion. Let me tell you man, it sucks bad. And that's highschool. Imagine it being your last shot in the sweet 16. That was a crazy ending though. Thanks for the suggestion.   Edit: added personal experience"
lakers,3czf56,nobullshitfrontpage,0,Mon Jul 13 04:45:52 2015 UTC,It shows a lack of strength of character and composure to me.  We know he was physically good enough to be in the NBA but the only conclusion is he was lacking character.

lakers,3czoxy,TheAsianMamba,4,Sun Jul 12 06:24:19 2015 UTC,"He's very raw, no doubt, and his movement doesn't look fluid. However, I think with some NBA strength and conditioning training, that will work itself out a bit. He isn't refined, but I'll take a 7 foot defensive project any day of the week"
lakers,3czoxy,Laker_Junkie,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:00:31 2015 UTC,"Yea I'm not saying he's a mistake. I just think getting reps in d league might serve him well. He's super low on basketball reps against nice competition. Having only plays a few games over the last two yrs. I'd like to bring him along a little quicker than bynum. So I'm not really looking forward to just letting him sit on our bench while never getting reps. Because right now, there's no way u could play him in a real NBA game. He's completely lost when it comes to offensive and defensive positioning. Plus his pick and roll is horrible for a 7footer. He curls the long way to he basket after a pick. And in screens, he has to get those hands down.. Real NBA refs gonna hit him for offensive fouls if ur a 7footer setting screens with ur elbows and arms up.. All it will take is a savy vet guard running his neck into his arms. I do see shot blocking ability, but that's no indication of high defensive iq which he appears to lack. But only 2 games in!!"

lakers,3czoxy,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:24:43 2015 UTC,I'm so tired of this Fucking joke.
lakers,3czoxy,jaysteezy24,6,Mon Jul 13 05:48:50 2015 UTC,"His screen weren't too bad though, I think he was worried about offensive foul calls most of the time because him and Russell aren't on same page yet. Because in the first game he was setting pretty good screens until he was called for a moving screen. But I agree with you, his defensive stance needs lots of improving. Allowing opposing big men to get wherever they wanted."
lakers,3czoxy,badguymatt,3,Sun Jul 12 06:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can really tell the lack of chemistry between Russell and Upshaw plays into effect on the way he sets screens. I think Reggie was actually discussing that point during game 1 against Minnesota. Upshaw was called for a moving screen when in actuality it was D'Lo's fault for starting to drive before his screen was set.   The chemistry will definitely come.   That's actually our biggest issue right now. Some of D'Lo's turnovers were simply due to the lack of chemistry. Many of our players still aren't used to expecting the unexpected with his passing ability. That'll come through practice though.   It's a good time to be a Laker fan, imo."
lakers,3czoxy,rebeltrillionaire,4,Sun Jul 12 06:39:00 2015 UTC,He was literally the only dude running to set screens. Everyone else was rolling before they could bump the trailing defender. Upshaw actually waited for the contact before rolling or finding space to be open for a jumper.  He also sets a screen and immediately put his hands up. He was also putting his hands up on a lot of cuts.  I loved what he was doing and have no idea wtd OP is on about.
lakers,3czoxy,KingNg,3,Sun Jul 12 09:06:23 2015 UTC,Some prestigious center needs to come in and work him out to turn him into Robert Upshaq.
lakers,3czoxy,LauranceFuller,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"He has so much room to improve but he's already an effective defender, which means nothing but good things."

lakers,3czoxy,TuneHD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:08:46 2015 UTC,Well these games is most folks first glance at just how raw is he. And I personally feel like he's D league raw.
lakers,3czoxy,Binzer777,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:51:07 2015 UTC,"Then I don't think you realize how important defensive anchors are in today's NBA. Upshaw looked good out there and just needs some proper coaching and development. It's not like he doesn't do anything, he was playing very well defensively."
lakers,3czoxy,Binzer777,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:28:24 2015 UTC,He will get minutes this year if he can set screens and stay out of foul trouble. His elite rim protection abilities demand minutes. On offense his only job will to not shoot anything outside of 3 ft
lakers,3czoxy,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:08:22 2015 UTC,"BTW, a couple of those bad screens are because the guard didn't wait for it to be set and #2 the refs are emphasizing the quim out of illegal screens in SPL"
lakers,3czoxy,Aliensdoexist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:09:27 2015 UTC,Yea agreed.. The pick and roll is just horribly executed these days.  Running its 35 feet from the basket is pointless. And why run it if the guard and big are gonna half ass the motions. I remember watching Dwight run it was so torching.
lakers,3d31s6,GabrielRodriguez115,12,Mon Jul 13 03:11:31 2015 UTC,"Explain how this doesn't fit our young team well. ""The Princeton offense is an offensive basketball strategy which emphasizes constant motion, passing, back-door cuts, picks on and off the ball, and disciplined teamwork.""  We don't even spend that much time in the Princeton offense. It's a guide we use to draw set plays, but we don't call a set play every possession. There is still plenty of room for creativity, just look at the second half of last season when Clarkson was running the offense. People think that you can't run pick and rolls while operating under the Princeton offense, that is simply not the case. We do not have a player on our team that we can give the ball to and get consistent points out of it. We need a system that will involve people on and off the ball. The main problem with the Princeton offense is that it requires moving without the ball and good screen-setting. These are skills that, although kind of forgot about in today's NBA, we should be encouraging our young core to learn. It is the surest way they can improve as a whole. There is nothing wrong with the Princeton offense, and considering how little we actually use it, it really shouldn't worry people."
lakers,3d31s6,Buckelroo,4,Mon Jul 13 03:36:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The off-ball screens I've been seeing during the summer league are lazy, and the movement without the ball have been there at times, but without those two, the offense really won't work.    But I believe stuff like this will improve in due time once Byron takes the reigns and the vets get a go during training camp. The multiple veteran presences on the team will make sure the rookies and young guns will get it right."
lakers,3d31s6,mister_greyMATTER,4,Mon Jul 13 05:07:57 2015 UTC,"Off ball screens are a crazy underrated part of basketball. Setting good hard screens can help wear a team down through the course of the game, especially with off ball screens you can single out a specific player (like the opponents best offensive player) and run the guy they're guarding through screens all day.  I remember reading some stat about how Lebron was the most screened player by the Spurs in Finals two years ago. I feel like that played a huge role in wearing him down over the course of the series."

lakers,3cyqvf,Jacariah,10,Sun Jul 12 01:13:12 2015 UTC,"Impact man, he'll be a great off the bench player for both SF and PF, since he's pretty quick and works extremely hard on both ends of the floor, he should be able to swing forward positions well"

And he'll put them to use right away in the reg season.  I think Russell is better for what we need and will work out better in the long run.  I am 100% happy with the direction they went with the pick.  Okafor needs to add some sort of mid-range shot.  He's trying that Tim Duncan bank, but it's not working for him so far."

lakers,3cyqvf,Citizen_of_Atlantis,17,Sun Jul 12 01:27:49 2015 UTC,I hope Russell builds muscle and hits the weight room. It was one of my biggest concerns about him when we drafted him.
lakers,3cyqvf,yatrickmith,21,Sun Jul 12 00:59:53 2015 UTC,"Watching him play, my biggest concern is that his ball handling isn't elite and his shooting doesn't seem to be near as good as we thought. If he's not fast enough to blow by his defender, he's going to have to be elite at those 2 other things to be a great player. To be fair, though, this is only based on the clips (shooting drills, practice) that I've seen plus the 2 summer league games."
lakers,3cyqvf,nochill95,16,Sun Jul 12 01:13:19 2015 UTC,"Ok guys I love Russell and all, but he's really unathletic"
lakers,3cyqvf,SPMrFantastic,8,Sun Jul 12 01:34:56 2015 UTC,That's been one of his major weaknesses. He really needs to work on conditioning and strength. Dude needs to live at the gym 24/7.

lakers,3cyqvf,ZombieSquatch,13,Sun Jul 12 01:36:46 2015 UTC,This number 9 dude cant finish shit
lakers,3cyqvf,ByTheBeardOfBruce,8,Sun Jul 12 00:50:07 2015 UTC,He couldn't even finish school
lakers,3cyqvf,owningypsie,8,Sun Jul 12 01:14:20 2015 UTC,Beautiful pass!!!
lakers,3cyqvf,SPMrFantastic,7,Sun Jul 12 01:27:36 2015 UTC,Clarkson scared me for a second there haha.
lakers,3cyqvf,owningypsie,6,Sun Jul 12 01:05:22 2015 UTC,Nance is sooo goood
lakers,3cyqvf,ape_cage,7,Sun Jul 12 01:05:42 2015 UTC,So glad we have Upshaw in this matchup or I'd be crying every time Okafor did that spin to fingerroll.
lakers,3cyqvf,Titanosaurus,7,Sun Jul 12 01:07:56 2015 UTC,I was still staring at those titties thooooo
lakers,3cyqvf,BerriesNCreme,6,Sun Jul 12 01:11:49 2015 UTC,D'Angelo needs to work on his conditioning. A lot of his mistakes look like they're a result of him being gased
lakers,3cyqvf,clippjoint,6,Sun Jul 12 01:21:53 2015 UTC,Agreed
lakers,3cyqvf,sunstersun,4,Sun Jul 12 02:10:46 2015 UTC,That comes with having a rookie. Their conditioning is nothing in the pro level.
lakers,3cyqvf,MaestrO_,6,Sun Jul 12 02:11:06 2015 UTC,Okafor is gonna have nightmares about Larry nance jr lol
lakers,3cyqvf,Wateriswet1212,5,Sun Jul 12 02:15:22 2015 UTC,LARRY LARRY LARRY !!!!!!!!!
lakers,3cyqvf,_FreshG,14,Sun Jul 12 02:31:43 2015 UTC,upshaw is a beast on defense.
lakers,3cyqvf,sharkytowers76,7,Sun Jul 12 02:31:50 2015 UTC,Man the way they call fouls in summer league seems to discourage centers from trying to play defense.
lakers,3cyqvf,ZombieSquatch,2,Sun Jul 12 01:07:55 2015 UTC,I swear you aren't allowed to touch anyone in these games.
lakers,3cyqvf,323Edgard,7,Sun Jul 12 00:57:13 2015 UTC,Anyone just hear Byron say Bass gonna come off the bench?? Randle the starter!
lakers,3cyqvf,SPMrFantastic,3,Sun Jul 12 00:59:47 2015 UTC,I bet Byron wishes he could have that one back.  That was a major tipping of his hand.  Not the end of the world...
lakers,3cyqvf,ZombieSquatch,6,Sun Jul 12 01:50:30 2015 UTC,I like the passing right there even though Black couldn't finish.
lakers,3cyqvf,thelakesh0w,6,Sun Jul 12 02:18:18 2015 UTC,JC making people buckle out there! HA! I love it!!!!
lakers,3cyqvf,ByTheBeardOfBruce,5,Sun Jul 12 00:48:54 2015 UTC,Nance Jr puttin in work on the glass
lakers,3cyqvf,Titanosaurus,6,Sun Jul 12 00:53:11 2015 UTC,Black has 5 fouls already. God damnit.
lakers,3cyqvf,VladDracul_III,2,Sun Jul 12 01:08:35 2015 UTC,He looking like a rookie
lakers,3cyqvf,Citizen_of_Atlantis,7,Sun Jul 12 01:18:46 2015 UTC,"russel needs to get used to the speed of the game, with the amount of crazy passes he attempts, he'll need to kinda go through what clarkson had to go through last year"
lakers,3cyqvf,sunstersun,6,Sun Jul 12 01:19:18 2015 UTC,Larry! Larry! Larry!
lakers,3cyqvf,nochill95,5,Sun Jul 12 02:35:40 2015 UTC,"Everybody saying how un-athletic Dlo is, and that he can't become very athletic, because you have to be born with it. How do you think other people get athletic?! It's not like he's an old dog out there and can't learn new tricks. I feel like everyone keeps forgetting how young he is and the raw potential and room for growth he has. Sure he has focused a lot on his passing and 3 ball in college, and look where he is with those skill sets. Now in the nba, he'll have professional trainers, and conditioning coaches, that will help to increase his athleticism and as well as every other skill. Just give him time. The FO knew this about him going into the draft. Dlo showed tons of superstar potential whilst Okafor showed a right now readiness for the nba, but not very much potential. Trust the process!!"
lakers,3cyqvf,OnlyinVegas,13,Sun Jul 12 02:35:47 2015 UTC,"Haha Russell, amazing pass. Can't wait to see many years of that."

lakers,3cyqvf,Citizen_of_Atlantis,5,Sun Jul 12 01:59:38 2015 UTC,That was a sweet move by okafor. A lot of ISO from him though

lakers,3cyqvf,ZombieSquatch,9,Sun Jul 12 02:31:42 2015 UTC,"God Okafor's foot work is the real deal. I love Russell, but that's nba caliber moves right there. His workout must have been pretty bad for us to pass on that."
lakers,3cyqvf,Citizen_of_Atlantis,6,Sun Jul 12 02:10:11 2015 UTC,That fucking pass yo.
lakers,3cyqvf,manolo88,3,Sun Jul 12 02:05:44 2015 UTC,Great sequence from Nance! Great defense and getting rewarded with the open court dunk
lakers,3cyqvf,Citizen_of_Atlantis,3,Sun Jul 12 01:05:51 2015 UTC,Nance Jr. with good defense and a dunk at the end! That's what I wanna see!
lakers,3cyqvf,thevisitor,3,Sun Jul 12 00:51:48 2015 UTC,Clarkson owns so hard
lakers,3cyqvf,ZombieSquatch,3,Sun Jul 12 00:51:58 2015 UTC,Clarkson with the moves!

lakers,3cyqvf,MaestrO_,3,Sun Jul 12 00:59:23 2015 UTC,Damn those last 30 sec were sloppy af
lakers,3cyqvf,Champstick,3,Sun Jul 12 01:01:02 2015 UTC,"Thing that sticks out to be after that 1st quarter, and all of yesterday's game, is that besides Nance Jr being an athletic player and hustler, he's very good at knowing where he needs to be, especially on defense."
lakers,3cyqvf,Mr_Chandler_Bing,3,Sun Jul 12 01:07:52 2015 UTC,The hell kind of defensive rotation was that? Russell was guarding Okafor lol
lakers,3cyqvf,ByTheBeardOfBruce,3,Sun Jul 12 01:10:05 2015 UTC,Madsen is coaching poorly
lakers,3cyqvf,ZombieSquatch,3,Sun Jul 12 01:18:11 2015 UTC,Black fouled out both games very early in the game. Hes lucky they have 10.
lakers,3cyqvf,BerriesNCreme,3,Sun Jul 12 01:18:39 2015 UTC,Need more Larry Nance Jr.
lakers,3cyqvf,Doocane,3,Sun Jul 12 01:19:19 2015 UTC,Larry Nance Jr's hustle and athleticism reminds me of Rodman...
lakers,3cyqvf,RufusPFunkerdale,3,Sun Jul 12 01:19:46 2015 UTC,Nance is a hustle machine.   Black getting too many silly fouls.  Upshaw is huge!
lakers,3cyqvf,helpChars,3,Sun Jul 12 01:20:01 2015 UTC,byron again

lakers,3cyqvf,B_tm_n,3,Sun Jul 12 01:32:54 2015 UTC,Russell's got to stop telegraphing that eurostep. It's going to get swatted to hell against legit starters.
lakers,3cyqvf,kawikaboy12,3,Sun Jul 12 01:50:04 2015 UTC,"Jordan Clarkson is a future star, straight up."
lakers,3cyqvf,Schneeky,3,Sun Jul 12 01:50:26 2015 UTC,This game is a hot mess. Ugh #SummerLeague
lakers,3cyqvf,Citizen_of_Atlantis,3,Sun Jul 12 02:03:21 2015 UTC,Looks like we've got a Larry Legend of our own!
lakers,3cyqvf,ape_cage,3,Sun Jul 12 02:16:06 2015 UTC,"Russell's game is like Harden's when he was with OKC, or like Brandon Roy's, he plays it slow and cool. Relax boys, he's just getting started!"
lakers,3cyqvf,SPMrFantastic,4,Sun Jul 12 02:32:37 2015 UTC,The more I see Nance Jr. the more I like the pick. Russell's court vision is for real but hope he starts shooting better.
lakers,3cyqvf,ZombieSquatch,8,Sun Jul 12 04:49:54 2015 UTC,Anyone else feel like these 6ers are better than the actual 6ers?
lakers,3cyqvf,ape_cage,6,Sun Jul 12 01:34:24 2015 UTC,Russell's gonna take a bit more time to get it together
lakers,3cyqvf,KopiKopi,4,Sun Jul 12 01:25:29 2015 UTC,Russell needs to step up right now. Too many mental mistakes
lakers,3cyqvf,BuyAllTheVowels,4,Sun Jul 12 02:25:47 2015 UTC,Looks like he has some trouble with the 24 sec. shot clock so far tonight.
lakers,3cyqvf,BuyAllTheVowels,4,Sun Jul 12 01:00:59 2015 UTC,Russell's looking a little sloppy today. A lot of forced shots and some of the passes he's making are a bit off
lakers,3cyqvf,rebeltrillionaire,4,Sun Jul 12 01:03:12 2015 UTC,"Things I took away from the 1st half:  Nance Jr looks good. I like his athleticism and defense.   Russell making mental mistakes, good at drawing fouls.   Black can't be getting so many damn fouls. He hasn't been great so far.  Clarkson made a few mistakes but overall looked good.   Anthony Brown hasn't shown up imo.  Upshaw is doing great against Okafor.   Hopes for 2nd half:   Less turnovers, more passing instead of iso-ing Clarkson and Russell up top, less fouls by Black."
lakers,3cyqvf,jtingin25,2,Sun Jul 12 02:17:53 2015 UTC,Let's get ittttttt Lakers
lakers,3cyqvf,TuneHD,2,Sun Jul 12 01:38:40 2015 UTC,This wolves Bulls game couldn't go any slower
lakers,3cyqvf,ZombieSquatch,2,Sun Jul 12 00:24:34 2015 UTC,I hope they slide Black to the 4 and give Upshaw the start. He deserves it.
lakers,3cyqvf,ZombieSquatch,2,Sun Jul 12 00:27:49 2015 UTC,"Nice D from Brown. Needs to stay within himself though, give up the rock and find your spot."
lakers,3cyqvf,yatrickmith,2,Sun Jul 12 00:29:35 2015 UTC,"Lol did I just hear, ""Hey Mike. Mike . Mike Mike Mike""   As Jordan shot his FTs?"

lakers,3cyqvf,Doocane,2,Sun Jul 12 00:51:08 2015 UTC,Somebody please get a screenshot of that stank face Embiid made when Okafor bricked his first free throw.

lakers,3cyqvf,ZombieSquatch,2,Sun Jul 12 01:08:04 2015 UTC,okafor getting upshaw'd
lakers,3cyqvf,igoforthejugular,2,Sun Jul 12 01:09:26 2015 UTC,you can definitely tell Upshaw hasn't played much with his reaction speed thus far.  good move by okafor though
lakers,3cyqvf,thevisitor,2,Sun Jul 12 01:10:44 2015 UTC,"Gotta make those free those, doe"
lakers,3cyqvf,ZombieSquatch,2,Sun Jul 12 01:11:17 2015 UTC,Some of these fouls Okafor's getting are questionable...
lakers,3cyqvf,BerriesNCreme,2,Sun Jul 12 01:11:23 2015 UTC,Bad offense. Womp.
lakers,3cyqvf,igoforthejugular,2,Sun Jul 12 01:19:36 2015 UTC,UPSHAW TIME GET HYPEEE

lakers,3cyqvf,makeitnashty,2,Sun Jul 12 01:32:29 2015 UTC,The rest of the players aren't even expecting to have a look at the basketball when playing with Russell. Tarik was totally surprised to see that ball coming his way

lakers,3cyqvf,ShaneMichaelOfficial,2,Sun Jul 12 01:56:50 2015 UTC,Sick block by Nance Jr.
lakers,3cyqvf,igoforthejugular,2,Sun Jul 12 01:57:16 2015 UTC,"You know what's missing on the floor tonight, why our offense looks so dead - no Randle.  People were giving him grief yesterday for playing ISO ball too much and and shit, but you gotta understand that he's an ISO type player. When the offense is not working you can give him the ball and count on him to get a GOOD shot up. When Kobe is out that's the type of role Randle can fill despite being a PF.   Clarkson has similar ability but it's more of a role meant for Randle imho."
lakers,3cyqvf,Thefirmbiz,2,Sun Jul 12 01:57:24 2015 UTC,I'm all aboard the Nance hype train! Lakers playing better with him on the floor!

lakers,3cyqvf,DonMakaveli,2,Sun Jul 12 02:03:15 2015 UTC,OOOOOOH LARRRRRY! #HUSTLE
lakers,3d1o69,kerby720,7,Sun Jul 12 20:11:21 2015 UTC,Why would Toronto trade Ross for a 36 year old Crawford and a 3rd string center at best? They could get a lot more than that.
lakers,3d1o69,misterrunon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:58:47 2015 UTC,Although Crawford is old he still is pretty good Imo he and Barnes were fun to watch especially since they had a decent 3pt shot even though they are very streaky. It be a worthy investment and they can make sacre a good mascot.
lakers,3d1o69,GabrielRodriguez115,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:16:10 2015 UTC,They're still in win now mode I think. Unless they're blowing it up and I'm not aware. But Crawford can still ball.
lakers,3d1o69,TheRealMelvinGibson,11,Mon Jul 13 22:23:45 2015 UTC,Ross isn't as good as you think
lakers,3d1o69,the24531,3,Sun Jul 12 20:27:30 2015 UTC,"I'd give up Kelly, Sacre and a future second though just to give him another shot outside of Toronto's system and see if he benefits at all from it. I'm not sure that he would though, since Toronto's current system really had its place for athletic/slashing wings. I'm not sure how much that will change with the signing of DeMarre. But it's a risk I'd be willing to take.   Neither Kelly or Sacre will be on our roster after this season, imo. And there's a very good chance our future 2nd round pick won't be able to even pan out to where Ross is right now."
lakers,3d1o69,badguymatt,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:50:19 2015 UTC,"I love Ross man, though he does remind me of Wesley Johnson who hasn't reached his full potential coming out of college... man I would root for us getting Ross for sure though - dude is a high flier."
lakers,3d1o69,spudwinkle,2,Sun Jul 12 21:00:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think we keep Buycks on our roster next year. We need a veteran point guard, not another player trying to latch onto the league. But regarding the Terrence Ross deal, I like it, but the lineup won't be as good as you think if  Lou Williams is the backup point guard. Rolling with Williams, Young, and Ross doesn't sound ideal defensively, and we going to see a lot of possessions ending in iso ball offensively."
lakers,3d1o69,jaysteezy24,2,Sun Jul 12 20:35:36 2015 UTC,"True that. Although I don't see the bench playing exclusively from the starting unit. I envision one of Clarkson or Russell on the court at all times.  I do agree though that Williams and Young are a bit redundant, because they both provide the same thing. However, we're not realistically going to be able to deal Young for anything right now (unless we maybe trade him to Cleveland for Haywood's non-guaranteed). I think we play out the first part of the year and look to deal him before the trade deadline."
lakers,3d1o69,jaysteezy24,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:51:00 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Clarkson or Russell should be running with the 2nd unit at all times. But then you will have the dilemma of Young and Ross fighting for the 3 spot. And I can't envision the scenario where one of em are starting and Clarkson/Russell is demoted to the bench. Clarkson is at his best a start, and even though Russell is a rookie and hasn't played a minute in the NBA I feel like playing next to Kobe and Clarkson will make things easier for him."
lakers,3d1o69,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:55:39 2015 UTC,How about this trade? http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=pcte953. We get more defense with Sefolosha and also get back Blazemore. And why did you add Buycks to the roster? I don't think he is very good.
lakers,3d1o69,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:53:19 2015 UTC,"The hawks wouldn't do this in a million years. It's basically young for seflosha and bazemore. Maybe add a second rounder but even then, you're reaching. I'd take bazemore for young straight up though. That would be nice."
lakers,3d1o69,LowkeyAnushole,2,Mon Jul 13 22:26:06 2015 UTC,"But in a million years they all would be dead, they would probably trade them then, right? I'm not reaching that much am I? I mean isn't Sefolosha coming off an injury? And are they really that high on Bazemore?"

lakers,3cz2kt,do_oby,2,Sun Jul 12 02:12:25 2015 UTC,One of the most exciting games in recent memory with Lakers come back from 18-point deficit playing the Gasol/Hill/Ebanks/Bryant/Blake line-up.  Full game highlight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjeaJNKqwoU  Box score: http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=320422013
lakers,3cz2kt,dissphemism,2,Sun Jul 12 02:17:15 2015 UTC,"Then a season or two later, he forgot about his strengths, fell in love with shooting the mid, and stayed floating on the perimeter looking for a pass.  We barely saw the guy who used to hustle and bang in the paint for offensive boards and putbacks."
lakers,3cz2kt,spudwinkle,3,Sun Jul 12 05:39:52 2015 UTC,"I was at this game, 10th row around center court. The dude was a beast. I remember in the last half of the 4th and in overtime, you never saw Bynum touch the court because Hill stole it all - it was awesome. From there on I loved seeing the dreads fly around on the court, and I'm sad to see him go but he deserves more starting time and we need more up-front improvement. Good luck #27!"

lakers,3cz4ry,mr-fiend,3,Sun Jul 12 02:43:25 2015 UTC,Curious if /u/smushparker has had a change of heart yet. Went around telling everyone who'd listen that it was the worst pick of the draft. Mitch knows
lakers,3cz4ry,Mantis-Toboggin,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:28:36 2015 UTC,ye most people never heard of him. just read an article that the spurs were intrigued by him and his draft stock was rising.
lakers,3cz4ry,igoforthejugular,-10,Sun Jul 12 04:34:18 2015 UTC,I still do
lakers,3cz4ry,WhiteKidMAADCity,47,Sun Jul 12 02:43:01 2015 UTC,"boy Russell looked awful. Not because he wasn't hitting his shots or making bad passes, that stuff will come with time. But he's so unexplosive off the pick. He gets absolutely no separation. He barely got past Okafor on the switch.  I thought the knock on Russell was his average athleticism, but today he looked (well) below average. I saw a 36 year old Kobe off of two serious leg injuries with more explosion.  Hopefully he's just not in good shape right now. I can't say I'm not a little worried though, even if it's just summer league"
lakers,3cz4ry,justgivingsomeadvice,22,Sun Jul 12 02:38:56 2015 UTC,Lakers have had 5 straight practices plus the 2 summer games. My theory is that he just didn't have his legs today.
lakers,3cz4ry,the_boy_who_lied,7,Sun Jul 12 03:02:29 2015 UTC,He also hasn't played ball prior to this for a few months.  He's also a kid and just spent two nights in Vegas. He could just be tired.
lakers,3cz4ry,amarstan,9,Sun Jul 12 03:58:45 2015 UTC,He's been doing draft training and workouts for the past 2 months probably near every day
lakers,3cz4ry,maxypooh15,15,Sun Jul 12 04:13:41 2015 UTC,It's very likely that he isn't conditioned well enough for NBA play yet. It's hard to be explosive when you are heaving up and down the court.
lakers,3cz4ry,Jacariah,12,Sun Jul 12 02:50:07 2015 UTC,"Why are other guys seemingly ""conditioned"" enough to play in the NBA then? It's still too early to tell how he'll pan out, but it's not looking good so far."
lakers,3cz4ry,misterrunon,3,Sun Jul 12 04:29:58 2015 UTC,"Byron is known to have tough practices, could be that. And it's a back to back. Of course Clarkson looked fine... He might be in better shape after a year in the NBA though. Idk hopefully it's a just a matter of conditioning and fatigue"
lakers,3cz4ry,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Sun Jul 12 06:14:12 2015 UTC,"All of those excuses apply to every other Laker player, though...   I gotta agree with /u/justgivingsomeadvice, what I saw tonight made me worried about Russell. Even more than athleticism, I hope it's not a heart/hustle issue."
lakers,3cz4ry,TheJucheisLoose,2,Sun Jul 12 06:41:27 2015 UTC,"Haha you're responding to the same guy.  Everything does apply to other Lakers players, but it's possible that small bit of explosiveness all the Lakers don't have due to fatigue is hurting Russell's game more.  Versus guys like Nance Jr and Clarkson who are clearly still superior athletes even without that extra bit of explosiveness  Idk, we'll have to see how he is when the season starts. Something to watch."
lakers,3cz4ry,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Sun Jul 12 07:43:10 2015 UTC,D'oh
lakers,3cz4ry,TheJucheisLoose,0,Sun Jul 12 07:44:25 2015 UTC,"Probably because as the second overall pick, in this orginization and whats expected from you as a player you are getting worked hard every day.   Not sure though just a theory, I don't see why he isn't fast like his size just yells out I'm fast but he isn't. That's really strange to me lol"
lakers,3cz4ry,NimbusIV,3,Sun Jul 12 05:30:31 2015 UTC,"That's just it with Randle too. He makes a lot of rookie mistakes, but has shown some clear explosiveness and athleticism that most 4 won't be able to handle. Sure he will blow an open look at the rim, but he did just get that open look after blowing past a guy or going through him. For me Randle is the most exciting piece on the team right now."
lakers,3cz4ry,PaperDesk,4,Sun Jul 12 04:12:49 2015 UTC,I could not have said it better.  Randle can get anything he wants offensively.  That's a great attribute to have.  His size/speed combo is incredibly rare and his ceiling is so so far above Russells.
lakers,3cz4ry,JustAGuy993,15,Sun Jul 12 04:25:25 2015 UTC,"My takeaways from the past 2 days:  Larry Nance is still a beast and has been the most impressive rookie so far. Knows what he can and can't do well, tries to stick to it. Will go far in the league as long as he remembers that.  I'm still looking for more from Russell. I think he will really benefit from the 2-3 months up to training camp. Gotta build up his endurance and hopefully he'll be better prepared for the speed of an NBA game once pre-season starts. The vision is there, but he's still adjusting.  Clarkson picking up exactly where he left off after the season. Best player on the floor.  Upshaw wants to do so much and simply doesn't have the energy. Must learn to play with his legs and not his hands.  Overall, I'm pleased with what I've seen. Nance has been the real surprise. Other than him, the rookies are playing exactly how I expected them to."
lakers,3cz4ry,justsomeguy5,24,Sun Jul 12 02:46:46 2015 UTC,LNJ. That is all.  Also I would not worry about D Russ' struggles. He's a rookie and many stars struggled in SL
lakers,3cz4ry,rl3191,2,Sun Jul 12 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"All the big names are struggling tbh. Towns had a so-so game, Okafor was pretty so-so. They'll come round, it's a lot to get a adjusted to."
lakers,3cz4ry,lemp44,32,Sun Jul 12 02:39:51 2015 UTC,okafor has been really good.
lakers,3cz4ry,Unknownmamba,14,Sun Jul 12 02:41:53 2015 UTC,"He had the advantage of playing a few summer league games before Russell  In his first game he got a whopping 2/6 from the field and only played 8 minutes scored 4 points 0/2 from the line  In his second he got 28 minutes and went 5/12 for 13 points 3/6 from the line  In his third he got 32 minutes went 5/10 for 11 points 1/3 from the line.  This was easily his best game, Russ needs more time. Also the ""eye test"" is subjective. The eye test says Kaminsky is a better prospect than Okafor and Towns, Summer league is where you get your legs under you, a lot of players can look great in summer league and bomb in the season."
lakers,3cz4ry,UltraFlyingTurtle,9,Sun Jul 12 02:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think people don't realize this isn't Okafor 2nd game. He played in the Utah Summer League before coming to Vegas so he's become more polished. He looked rusty in the first two games."
lakers,3cz4ry,McHandsome,2,Sun Jul 12 03:03:34 2015 UTC,Okafor went 18 and 10 with a pair of blocks and a steal in his first game...
lakers,3cz4ry,Unknownmamba,0,Sun Jul 12 05:26:44 2015 UTC,http://i.cdn.turner.com/nba/nba/.element/media/2.0/teamsites/jazz/76ers_vs_Spurs_Final_Book.pdf  The box score from his SL game
lakers,3cz4ry,Unknownmamba,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:59:19 2015 UTC,"Oh I see I misread it, thats only the first quarter"
lakers,3cz4ry,McHandsome,3,Sun Jul 12 06:00:10 2015 UTC,Yeah Prof Oak finished the first half like 3 for 11. He went 6 of 10 in the second half and has been very good since then.
lakers,3cz4ry,virji24,-2,Sun Jul 12 06:07:33 2015 UTC,This. Okafor has shown signs but hasn't been great by any means
lakers,3cz4ry,chief-yeezy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:24:09 2015 UTC,We all knew that Okafor was by far the most NBA ready prospect. These SL results shouldn't surprise.
lakers,3cz4ry,lemp44,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:59:44 2015 UTC,He shot almost the same percentage as Clarkson tonight. Not a fantastic game by any stretch for either of them.
lakers,3cz4ry,Scabandiri,3,Sun Jul 12 02:47:22 2015 UTC,"Okafor was fast, solid pnr defense, surprisingly good overall defense , he had very good conditioning, and established great looks which he barely missed. Easy bunnies. He played very well. Russell didn't, but I'm not concerned. Teammates missed a few good passes, his D was solid, and he rebounded well. He is just out of shape, gassed, mental mistakes and turnovers"
lakers,3cz4ry,Jacariah,2,Sun Jul 12 02:56:16 2015 UTC,"i don't care about the box score, the eye test showed his slowness off the pick an roll is concerning."
lakers,3cz4ry,revolver066,0,Sun Jul 12 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"He's getting a lot of touches though, he has the ball almost every time down the court. But for a center, he shot terribly and was saved by some pretty bad foul calls."
lakers,3cz4ry,lemp44,46,Sun Jul 12 02:51:34 2015 UTC,Russell's lack of athleticism really worries me.
lakers,3cz4ry,justgivingsomeadvice,18,Sun Jul 12 02:33:58 2015 UTC,"He just cant turn the corner against these guards.  It is a little worrying.    Was hoping he'd shoot better from the outside too.   Oh well, its early. Maybe he needs to get his legs under him."
lakers,3cz4ry,lmaonade200,41,Sun Jul 12 02:39:46 2015 UTC,"Nash had 0 athleticism and he won two MVP's. Russell just needs to learn how to finish like Nash - instead of finishing over guys, use your body. He'll be fine, I'm not worried about in the least."
lakers,3cz4ry,Wenjaman,15,Sun Jul 12 02:41:11 2015 UTC,"Nash was pretty quick before Lillard killed him. Not conventionally athletic but still quite quick. Nash also moved more smoothly, not really sure how to explain it. Hopefully that's just a matter of fatigue though."
lakers,3cz4ry,happyadrian,4,Sun Jul 12 03:14:01 2015 UTC,"Nash also moved more smoothly   That's a good job of explaining it actually. Nash is fast and quick but doesn't have the explosiveness in his step or dribble, but he makes up for it by being really smooth with ball handling, doing work with his fingers and footwork in traffic (soccer player and all), some of these things we saw last year with Jeremy Lin actually. Lin isn't all that fast when you compare him with other speedy point guards, but he is extremely good at bee-lining his way through traffic and creating opportunities.  And all this can be developed as a skill, don't lose hope on Russell just yet"
lakers,3cz4ry,yungJoc,2,Sun Jul 12 05:08:12 2015 UTC,Nah Lin is actually fast as fuck. STATS
lakers,3cz4ry,amarstan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:29:35 2015 UTC,"Nash has self-described himself as being fluid, the ability to move like water."
lakers,3cz4ry,TheHoneyBadger,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:42:24 2015 UTC,Nash was a master at timing his dribble and we also think of Nash running coherent offenses under D'antoni rather than summer league Princeton on the fly.  Man I'd love to see a time machine where we have a prime stoudemire setting screens and playing with russell.  I'm not tripping on Russ at all - eventually the offense will move better and he's long and quick enough to create space.
lakers,3cz4ry,ohsemantics,0,Sun Jul 12 11:47:52 2015 UTC,Nash also didn't just spend 2 nights in Vegas. Russell looked like he might have had some fun last night. He's 19 and its summer league. I'm ok with it.
lakers,3cz4ry,BecauseGodardSaidSo,14,Sun Jul 12 03:56:57 2015 UTC,Also don't forget he was playing the second game of a back-to-back. He looked a little gassed to me.
lakers,3cz4ry,Ryan_Firecrotch,0,Sun Jul 12 02:48:58 2015 UTC,"He's 19, dude."
lakers,3cz4ry,cheeseyone,26,Sun Jul 12 03:24:04 2015 UTC,19 year olds don't get tired?
lakers,3cz4ry,Loryk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:26:46 2015 UTC,"These are supposed to be world class athletes man.  So no, a 19 year old NBA phenom should not be tired after two games in the summer league."
lakers,3cz4ry,BecauseGodardSaidSo,13,Sun Jul 12 03:33:46 2015 UTC,"That's pretty funny. You think he's the first guy to get tired during the transition from college to the pros? World class athlete or not, happens all the time."
lakers,3cz4ry,CoolScales,3,Sun Jul 12 04:24:51 2015 UTC,"Dude could be sore from his fucking NBA game yesterday, you know, just maybe."
lakers,3cz4ry,captaincyfk,3,Sun Jul 12 07:40:41 2015 UTC,They've been practicing too and traveling and doing a ton of media commitments.  I guarantee their legs are not even 80%
lakers,3cz4ry,PaperDesk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:50:19 2015 UTC,Nobody in the nba ever has 100% legs. it's an 82 game season.
lakers,3cz4ry,Neilmev,-9,Sun Jul 12 18:56:01 2015 UTC,"I understand that, and I'm not saying there is no fatigue, but again, these are not only supposed to be world class like top 1% athletes but they're also players who are supposed to be at their physical PRIME.  Also, the player we're specifically talking about is a highly touted ""future of the franchise"" type player, so if you're saying that he's tired and unable to perform well under these kinds of circumstances, then man, things definitely don't look good.  But to clarify, I really REALLY REALLLLLY want to be wrong about Russell.  I want him to be a superstar and to carry the Lake show for the next 20 years.  I just really really liked Okafor."
lakers,3cz4ry,Soaring_Seagull24,3,Sun Jul 12 04:02:23 2015 UTC,"But you have to realize he's a rookie. Not even a fully seasoned one yet. He's literally worked out for less than a month with an actual NBA-style training crew. The competition level is different than college. Sure, it's summer league, but that doesn't mean the guys on the other teams are scrubs. Some of those guys, who were guarding DLo last night and today, have had that experience. Just give him some time to get used to the conditioning of the NBA. He isn't a top 1% athlete yet, that comes throughout the season."
lakers,3cz4ry,IMjudas,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:17:13 2015 UTC,You don't sign up for military and get dropped into battle after a month. Let him adjust.  he was drafted for his world class potential. Every flash of brilliance is an indication. When he fucks up he's learning from it. That's his job. He's seeing what he can do. He was the first one to know he needs to work on conditioning. He was first to realize his handles need work to be NBA ready. He knows. He'll be fine. Lakers will be fine. Have faith
lakers,3cz4ry,lmaonade200,2,Sun Jul 12 08:37:22 2015 UTC,"Make no mistake, Nash was pretty athletic in his prime. He wasn't a sprint champion, but he was a lot quicker in the back court than most guards. Definitely above average. A better comparison would be John Stockton. That dude had no athleticism, but is still the second best PG to ever play the game."
lakers,3cz4ry,deadlyprincehk,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:03:37 2015 UTC,He wasn't athletic but he was mad quick.
lakers,3cz4ry,Theingloriousak2,8,Sun Jul 12 03:27:01 2015 UTC,Same here. He just looks so unathletic compared to the other guards.
lakers,3cz4ry,clippjoint,4,Sun Jul 12 02:48:06 2015 UTC,His play style doesn't use athleticism. He's crafty and smooth and always in control. He's by no means an elite athlete but I don't think he's unathletic. He looks exhausted more than anything.
lakers,3cz4ry,rinswa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:57:15 2015 UTC,"With some work he can make up for it with savvy handles and fast hands, which are things that can be developed, while only parts of athleticism can be trained. He definitely doesn't have that first step and dribble like Clarkson does but that's why it's a team game."
lakers,3cz4ry,ZombieSquatch,10,Sun Jul 12 05:04:32 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness, I came out of this game, which we won, way more disappointed in the team's performance than in yesterday's game, which we lost. Our offense looked hopelessly stagnant. Maybe some of it was fatigue."
lakers,3cz4ry,Kauaileonard,5,Sun Jul 12 02:42:15 2015 UTC,Looked like a typical Byron Scott offense to me. Standing around for ten seconds while the center holds the ball at the top of the 3 point line then giving it to the PG with a few seconds to make an attempt at a pick and roll :(
lakers,3cz4ry,helpChars,10,Sun Jul 12 03:50:55 2015 UTC,Russell will get there it's just gonna take some time he's only 19

lakers,3cz4ry,lebronsucks123,13,Sun Jul 12 02:41:30 2015 UTC,DLo has to improve alot but he'll get there.   LARRY NANCE JR. 10x ALL STAR CONFIRMED.
lakers,3cz4ry,virji24,8,Sun Jul 12 02:38:23 2015 UTC,"So after 2 summer league games: we should've selected nance with the 2nd pick, & d'angelo has prigioni athleticism, & shoots like Rubio."
lakers,3cz4ry,lebronsucks123,3,Sun Jul 12 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"I don't expect Russell to dominate this summer, but it'd be nice to see one wow game from him where he just does something that merits the recent praise he's been getting. Play more with the flow of the game or show that he's ""the best player in the draft""."
lakers,3cz4ry,iNteL-_-,3,Sun Jul 12 05:33:25 2015 UTC,ITT people overreact to a summer league game
lakers,3cz4ry,MemoMii,5,Sun Jul 12 06:42:23 2015 UTC,"If this were the stock market, Russell is like that really volatile tech IPO that you really really hope blows up but deep down know there's a good chance you might lose some cash and Okafor is that safe, healthy Vanguard index fund that might not make you a millionaire but you know it'll be a good, safe investment that steadily builds you wealth over time."
lakers,3cz4ry,Nathaaan,4,Sun Jul 12 03:39:30 2015 UTC,"Russell lacks the first step needed to attack the rim effectively. Once he gets settled in, he'll be racking up dimes and cutting down turnovers. Also, Okafor is looking very good."
lakers,3cz4ry,WhiteKidMAADCity,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:46:34 2015 UTC,"His speed seems about as good as Hardens to me, who is great at getting to the basket"
lakers,3cz4ry,TheHoneyBadger,2,Sun Jul 12 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"All these guy have good speed, its about that burst of explosiveness that is extremely helpful when driving. I still think Russell will find a way to get to the rim more easily."

lakers,3cz4ry,justgivingsomeadvice,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:23:03 2015 UTC,a lot of these comments about Russell are retarded as hell. He's fine and really good.
lakers,3cz4ry,C3PO1Fan,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:18:29 2015 UTC,"Regarding D'Russ, didn't have a great game however there's no need for people to be commenting that they're worried etc...It's a process. With a guy like him it takes time to develop, get used to the pace of the game. Yeah, he turned the ball over a lot today but that can be attributed to thinking a bit too much but with more game time he will make the right play. Also he missed a couple of shots late in the shot clock and probably needs to work on getting to the rim. But damn that pass to split the two defenders!  He's got the tools and the attitude to succeed...so wait it out for a bit and he kill it!"
lakers,3cz4ry,WhiteKidMAADCity,-11,Sun Jul 12 06:25:04 2015 UTC,I really don't like Nance
lakers,3cz4ry,C3PO1Fan,7,Sun Jul 12 02:38:39 2015 UTC,Care to elaborate?
lakers,3cz4ry,justbringitbitch,-12,Sun Jul 12 02:46:52 2015 UTC,He's athletic but that's all he has. Tweener forwards who can't shoot don't usually have great careers. Just look at Anthony Bennett and Derrick Williams.  And I think I'm always going to judge him for his Kobe comments and subsequent half assed apologies.
lakers,3cz4ry,Neilmev,8,Sun Jul 12 02:49:49 2015 UTC,"And I think I'm always going to judge him for his Kobe comments and subsequent half assed apologies.   Have you seen his other tweets around the same time? He's a total Kobe homer. Talked about how Kobe > Lebron and just posted a  bunch of stupid fanboy shit, the same nonsense you or I would post.   You know why you haven't heard about it? Because he's a mature guy who owned up to what he said instead of making excuses about how it was a joke or something and that he's actually a huge Kobe fan."
lakers,3cz4ry,justbringitbitch,3,Sun Jul 12 03:17:22 2015 UTC,"You're comparing a guy picked at 27 to a guy picked 1st and a guy picked 2nd.  You draft a roleplayer there, not someone you think is going to be a star."
lakers,3cz4ry,amarstan,-2,Sun Jul 12 04:42:18 2015 UTC,"And Bennett has barely been an average role player, I don't think Nance will ever be more than a below average role player."

lakers,3cz4ry,amarstan,-15,Sun Jul 12 04:50:56 2015 UTC,"We're over here making excuses for this guy. But, what's his ceiling? Nash? Curry? That doesn't impress me. PG's win you regular season games, meaningless regular season MVP's, and lucky one and done championships. Post play gets you dynasties."
lakers,3cz4ry,eaarrl,4,Sun Jul 12 03:16:58 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about?   If a pg's ceiling is curry, I don't know what you are worrying about. The Warriors just won a championship and are poised to compete for many more with their young squad."
lakers,3cz4ry,goat_justinanderson,-10,Sun Jul 12 03:33:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not a keep up with the Jones', flavor of the month kind of fan. I know my history. It wasn't too long ago when we were going back to back playing through the post. These great PG's of ""today's NBA"" don`t win multiple championships."
lakers,3cz4ry,GOATLin,9,Sun Jul 12 03:42:57 2015 UTC,"Hey! A fellow old guy like myself.  I too love post play. I too remember when all the best players in the game were big men and you could win titles based around excellent post play.  Sadly, those days are gone. They are gone by design. The league changed defensive rules to essentially make that style of basketball very inefficient.  The two best low post scorers in the league are Al Jefferson and Brook Lopez. Neither would be considered an elite franchise player today. They would've been legends if they played in the 90s.  The modern big man is like an NFL nose tackle. Just needs to protect the paint, get a lot of rebounds, and be able to roll to the basket and finish at the rim. He does the dirty work while the perimeter players have all the fun.  Your NBA, and my NBA, is dead sir. And the league killed it when they changed the rules. It didn't die right away, but the Thibs defense exploited the rule change, and the reaction to the Thibs defense made the old style of basketball obsolete.  All championship teams now are built on spacing and ball movement, largely using the pick and roll to start the offense. The game done changed."
lakers,3czbsu,osama-bin-dada,18,Sun Jul 12 03:46:58 2015 UTC,Basically it's harder to adjust when you have to be running the offense vs just scoring/rebound  +there's no real size advantage  I think he'll be fine
lakers,3czbsu,Theingloriousak2,7,Sun Jul 12 03:49:23 2015 UTC,Yea this is the main reason I think. It's harder for point guards to transition like it is a quarterback in the nfl.

lakers,3czbsu,CHUN_BUNS,5,Mon Jul 13 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"Granted Russell is not as athletic as Rose once was, but it shows that adapting to the NBA pace as a PG takes time"
lakers,3czbsu,redundantPOINT,2,Sun Jul 12 03:48:57 2015 UTC,"I feel like saying Russell isn't as athletic as Rose is misleading. Rose had once in a generation type athleticism coming out of college. His game was raw, but he was able to over power his defenders due to his speed. D'angelo Russell was scouted as having average athleticism (not really proving it atm, but we will see), but an extremely polished offensive game. Scoring, handle, and passing were all things people were saying he should be able to be elite at in the NBA. I understand it's only been two games, but when your big selling point is NBA readiness and you struggle against players who probably aren't even going to make their NBA team this year, it's concerning. That being said, this does seem like the perfect game to set up a massive outing against the Knicks on Monday. It will be exciting to watch."
lakers,3czbsu,Titanosaurus,2,Sun Jul 12 06:04:49 2015 UTC,"Rose's athleticism was in a league of his own, with Westbrook. DLo is not in that category, but is athletic in his own right and closer to Nash and can be crafty like Harden. His game can mold from different types of players and he can be special as he has the tools and vision. He's still learning a new system and is also playing with players who won't find him in his spots (only Clarkson and Randle are the other playmakers on the SL team)"
lakers,3czbsu,sunstersun,8,Sun Jul 12 07:33:11 2015 UTC,"I'm just worried with Russell's inability to get to the rim at all. He's got a really slow first step, and he's not going to be able to rely on his shot at all times. Even unathletic pgs like Nash are very crafty and have impeccable handles, but Russell's handles haven't impressed me much either. Hopefully he can prove is wrong within the next few games."
lakers,3czbsu,JustAGuy993,7,Sun Jul 12 03:53:00 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping this is just fatigue, and will look for him to bounce back. At the end of the day, he's 19 and we'll have to be patient and give him time to grow. Clarkson is 22 and has more muscle, Russell should get there"
lakers,3czbsu,Gardeon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:56:20 2015 UTC,Russell has solid handles and has a respectable jumper that won't allow players to sag off of him.   I think he'll get plenty of drives once he finds his place in the offense.   Right now he looks like he's learning to run the offense and is deferring to Jordan Clarkson.
lakers,3czbsu,PaperDesk,-1,Sun Jul 12 18:11:26 2015 UTC,He's practically a rookie and hasn't played competitive basketball in a year. Blake Griffin is the best PF right now. I think julius randle will be fine.

lakers,3czbsu,Laker_Junkie,2,Sun Jul 12 04:22:23 2015 UTC,"^ this. There were absolutely no questions about Rose's athleticism coming into the NBA. I did like how D'Angelo addressed the concerns about his athleticism when he said he wants to be known as a good basketball player, first and foremost, before being considered an athlete. And then again, look at how injury-prone Rose has turned out to be with his playing style."
lakers,3czbsu,ProdigalReality,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:30:37 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to athleticism, or conditioning? If it's not about the numbers, then at least he has a good feel for the game, and his passing has been great. He just doesn't look comfortable in the offense, and hasn't been explosive getting to the rim"
lakers,3czbsu,Haiko248,2,Sun Jul 12 05:51:32 2015 UTC,His passing hasn't been good. In two games he's had 9 assists and 12 turnovers. He's really sloppy with the ball right now and isn't really able to facilitate the offense at the moment.
lakers,3czbsu,DaBigTree,3,Sun Jul 12 05:58:33 2015 UTC,"A lot of his turnovers are sue to him trying to drive through traffic, not passing"
lakers,3d0g81,Buckelroo,11,Sun Jul 12 13:33:19 2015 UTC,We need him so that Dwight Byucks never sees the court for the Lakers again. Let Jabari have all the backup PG minutes and see what he can do.

lakers,3d0g81,TheAsianMamba,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:15:57 2015 UTC,I like Dwight on defense.. for a split second.. like literally only from when the ball handler takes the ball up court until he's established his position at the top of the 3pt line. He's pretty decent at containing guards in that small area lol.
lakers,3d0g81,badguymatt,5,Sun Jul 12 22:21:49 2015 UTC,He's playing Monday but he'll be wearing goggles to protect his left eye. 👓

lakers,3d0g81,Penoii,2,Mon Jul 13 03:56:06 2015 UTC,We need him to win summer league. He was the leading scorer from Dleague. He may give Clarkson a run for his money in SL.
lakers,3cy9hz,chaseeast,13,Sat Jul 11 21:34:12 2015 UTC,"He obviously won't improve anymore in terms of expanding his skill set, but he can still learn to play the game smarter. More off ball plays where he isn't dominating the ball will help him in the long run, because hes playing within a team's system and not just out there gunning. Defensively its just a matter of motivation and accountability."
lakers,3cy9hz,jaysteezy24,9,Sat Jul 11 22:16:35 2015 UTC,"I like nick, you can't say every every fan doesn't like him.. Nick is good for us especially because of all the young ones coming in, I think some fans over react because of his behavior, but it's not like he's always getting suspended and wasting our money.. The guy can score and we need that. Sure D isn't his forte but if you need a person to drop a couple points or to expand the lead he can do it"
lakers,3cy9hz,ILikeChocolateMilkk,-9,Sat Jul 11 23:06:53 2015 UTC,"Drop a couple of points, too bad he needs six shots to do that."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,19,Sun Jul 12 04:07:03 2015 UTC,"I think he still has a lot to offer. Fans tend to forget that he was a candidate for 6MOTY in past seasons. And I know last year wasn't his best offensively, but he was injured for the majority of it. I think our team could definitely use his energy coming off the bench. I'm also happy my Young jersey that I bought last season is still relevant. Let's make a comeback this year Swaggy!"
lakers,3cy9hz,dr3wd3zi,-14,Sat Jul 11 22:05:45 2015 UTC,"Uh no, he never was. He's always been an inefficient scorer with is horrible on defense, rebounding and playmaking. So giving him this ""He was injured"" excuse.  Better off using that jersey as toilet paper."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,28,Sun Jul 12 04:06:18 2015 UTC,"Nick actually plays strong d.   He's not elite or will ever be considered a stopper, but he's not the liability everyone paints him to be."
lakers,3cy9hz,redundantPOINT,9,Sat Jul 11 22:09:22 2015 UTC,"Young is a very competitive guy, people underrate that about him calling him a clown. He's one of those guys who sees a duel and accepts it, that's where he really shines. I remember back on Christmas day when he was literally our best player on the court and he put up 20 on the Miami Heat with LBJ guarding him. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IH2Jnf45BI"
lakers,3cy9hz,TuneHD,-16,Sat Jul 11 22:47:45 2015 UTC,But he is a clown. He's a garbage player and has been garbage throughout his career. So what if he put up twenty on Lebron once. What about the dozens of other games he's been garbage?
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,4,Sun Jul 12 04:04:44 2015 UTC,Look at his season averages for the 2013-2014 season. Is that trash to you? I mean they aren't star caliber numbers or anything but the dude is a nice bench player. He always gives it his all and really isn't the liability on D people make him out to be.
lakers,3cy9hz,PeaceOfficer420,-11,Sun Jul 12 04:16:08 2015 UTC,"Yes they're trash. He's never once in his career shot over forty-five percent from the field (The low mark for efficient for a wing player), was a horrible defender, horrible rebounder for his size, and a horrible playmaker. So in that regard, he has no positive trait whatsoever.  And he really is the liability that everyone claims him to be. He's absolutely dreadful. And what's worse is that when he doesn't get the ball on the offensive end, he starts to pout there and stop moving, and then on the defensive end he just gives up all effort. That's despicable."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,2,Sun Jul 12 04:22:15 2015 UTC,"Do you watch Laker games? I watch every game I can and Nick Young is not the garbage you claim him to be. He draws a good amount of charges. His huge wingspan helps him on defense and he can seriously get hot with his jumper. I wouldn't be super upset if he got traded, but his contract is reasonable. I hope he stays on the team. I understand my opinion of him may be biased (he was one of the only entertaining aspects of the season after Dwight left), but you just seem to have some unreasonable hatred for a guy with enough talent to stay in the NBA for a decade. I am sorry that something so trivial as the quality of play of a random NBA player bothers you so much."
lakers,3cy9hz,PeaceOfficer420,-4,Sun Jul 12 04:38:52 2015 UTC,"I watch every Laker playoff (Not for the last two years obviously), regular season, pre-season and Summer League game.  Great, he can get hot, wonderful. Garbage players can always have a decent game every now and then, that's not the point. He does one thing (Score) inefficiently, and is garbage in everything else. His defense is horrible, his awareness is shit and he plain just pouts when he doesn't get the ball on the other end. He doesn't bend at the knees, and that's why he gets beat off the dribble routinely.  There's nothing ""entertaining"" about him. There's nothing entertaining about a player who talks about ""swag"", and how they're afraid of dolphins or crap like that. He takes more pride in being a TMZ headline than a basketball player."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,3,Sun Jul 12 04:43:33 2015 UTC,"That's your opinion you have decided upon for yourself after watching multiple games with him playing for your favorite team. I can respect that. What worries me is that you have replied to every person in this thread with anything positive to say about Nick Young with your negativity. I'm also pretty sure I've seen you in other threads hating on him. You do you man. Even if I am wrong, which is possible I am no basketball genius and if I was I would be working in the field, your negativity is not healthy. I am going to agree to disagree here. Have a good night dude it's always intriguing to debate with somebody with a different viewpoint than me."
lakers,3cy9hz,PeaceOfficer420,-5,Sun Jul 12 04:56:22 2015 UTC,"What I can't stand is when people are just willing to blind themselves to the obvious because they like his gimmick.

lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,2,Sun Jul 12 06:18:22 2015 UTC,"Show me a 6th man guard who doesn't shoot around 40%, I'll wait. Lou Will, Jamal Crawford, reigning 6th men, but shoot 40%. If you actually watched and paid attention to basketball you'd realize the role of 6th men is to come out and basically chuck for some quick buckets in limited minutes. They don't get any plays run for them, they get nobody else to create shots for them, they basically do what Kobe in his prime did, but at an inefficient rate given not everybody is Kobe. Everything you criticize him is the difference between a bench player and a star player. If 6th men had the complete game you're begging for, they'd be perennial all stars."
lakers,3cy9hz,TuneHD,-1,Sun Jul 12 04:40:58 2015 UTC,"That's not the point of the sixth man at all. But here are all the wing players that shot over forty percent going back to to 2000 (Even though the benchmark should be forty-five percent, but whatever, I'll play your game)  2000: Rodney Rogers (.486)  2001: Aaron McKie (.472)  2002: Corliss Williamson (.510)  2003: Bobby Jackson (.464)  2005: Ben Gordon (.411) [Under the efficient threshold of forty-five percent but also provided 2.6 rebounds and 2 assists despite being 6'2]  2006: Mike Miller (.466)  2007: Leandro Barbosa (.472)  2008: Manu Ginobili (.460)  2009: Jason Terry (.463)  2010: Jamal Crawford (.449) [Below the the efficient threshold of forty-five percent, but also provided 2.5 rebounds and 3 assists]  2012: James Harden (.435) [Under the efficiency threshold but provided 5.1 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 1.6 steals]  2013: JR Smith (.422) [Under the efficiency threshold of forty-five percent but also provided 5.3 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 1.3 steals]  2014: Jamal Crawford (.412) [Under the efficiency threshold of forty-five percent but also provided 2.3 rebounds and 3.2 assists]  2015: Lou Williams (.404) [Under the efficiency threshold of forty-five percent but also provided 1.9 rebounds and 2.1 assists also]  I left out the power forwards that got the award such as Lamar Odom and Antwan Jamison. The point of a sixth man is NOT to just chuck shots. It's to lead the bench to continue on the production that the starters built up, to expand the lead, to hold stead and to at times run with the starters. And a lot of sixth men ARE All-Stars. My goodness.  You must have just started watching basketball because what you said is COMPLETELY wrong about plays getting called for them. I didn't even bother to mention the defense some of the sixth men I mentioned provided. You really need to learn the game before spouting off crap next time."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,2,Sun Jul 12 05:02:52 2015 UTC,"For starters, you hand picked years and people you picked were/are starter players such as Harden, Manu, Terry, and even Miller. Nick Young actually shoots 42% for his career and has shot 44% twice and 43% twice. Then looking at guys like McKie, he averages a low ppg so his efficiency is irrelevant given he had limited touches. You only found 2 guys who were actually 6th men for their careers and shot at a good fg% by going back 15 years. 6th men aren't always guys who just chuck of course since sometimes you get guys like Lamar Odom or Birdman from the Heat. The point is, most 6th men  SGs are guys brought in to make their own offense and give you that boost. It's difficult to do that at an efficient rate given you aren't running any real plays, you just go out there and feel the game when you produce."
lakers,3cy9hz,TuneHD,-1,Sun Jul 12 13:13:46 2015 UTC,"I handpicked years? I did ever Sixth Man of the Year going back to 2000 SANS power forwards (Lamar Odom and Antwan Jamison). If I were going to handpick years, wouldn't it have made sense to exclude the years were a player shot UNDER forty-five percent? Also in regards to starters, Nick Young also started a good number of games in his career, come on kid. Smarten up.  And yes, he shoots forty-two percent for his career, which is UNDER forty-five percent. Who cares if he shot forty-four percent once and forty-three percent twice when he provides NOTHING else in terms of being a basketball player. That's why this is a big deal, he is a LOW EFFICIENCY CHUCKER who provides NOTHING else in terms of the game of basketball. Horrible defender, terrible rebounder for his size, terrible playmaker, NOTHING. You'd think he'd as least be average in everything else, but he's just God awful.  Who cares if McKie averaged low points? He provides much in the way of an OVERALL game, and that's what you don't seem to understand. Being a sixth man does NOT mean you just go in there and chuck away while sucking at every other facet of the game.  Also Birdman was never the ""sixth man"" for the Heat, lol, come on dude. Being an energy dude does not make you the sixth man. And once again, being a sixth man does NOT mean you don't have plays run for you or the bench and that you just have free license to chuck away. You've got a lot to learn about basketball if you believe that."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,2,Sun Jul 12 15:30:45 2015 UTC,"So you think Jamal Crawford, Nick Young, JR Smith, and Lou Will really go through plays coming off the bench? Hate to break it to you, but bench guys are usually on the bench for a reason. They don't have complete games or else they'd be starting outside phew cases such as Iggy where he's asked to run the bench. The guys I listed are shooting guards are who asked to come in and get buckets. Anything beyond that is just icing on the cake."
lakers,3cy9hz,TuneHD,2,Sun Jul 12 19:24:10 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I've seen him play good d especially when motivated."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,-7,Sat Jul 11 22:27:04 2015 UTC,"Oh boohoo, he has to be ""motivated"". Screw off with that crap."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,-10,Sun Jul 12 04:05:05 2015 UTC,That's a whole lotta bullshit you just said there.
lakers,3cy9hz,megavino,5,Sun Jul 12 04:01:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he had one good year and one subpar year. I think he has the right to at least one more year before we label him like we are now. He was unanimously loved this time last year. Also, I really want to see kobe, young, and lou will on the court at the same time. It's either gonna be raining jumpers or brick city"
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,-10,Sat Jul 11 22:57:23 2015 UTC,But his first year wasn't good.

We get it already.   You don't like the guy and want him gone.    I'd be okay with him doing it on every thread maybe,  but every comment???   That's pathetic.     I  just want Nick to stay and have  a good year at this point."
lakers,3cy9hz,dissphemism,5,Sun Jul 12 15:59:15 2015 UTC,"And people are ecstatic over the Lou signing, but wants to get rid of Young.. Over their past 5 seasons, Lou has been a less efficient player compared to Nick Young.  That's counting in Young's injury-riddled '15 season where he missed 40 games, and with Lou playing on much better teams the past 5 seasons, on a weak conference.  And if we exclude Young's uncharacteristic '15 season, that gap in efficiency over Lou just grows even wider."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,-8,Sat Jul 11 22:18:19 2015 UTC,"Except the reason for Lou's low numbers are due to the inordinate amount of threes he takes which is not good at. Once Scott cuts down on the number threes he takes, his efficiency will rise. His two point field goal percentage is very good."
lakers,3cy9hz,dissphemism,2,Sun Jul 12 04:08:53 2015 UTC,"Except it isn't very good. Lou shot 44 2PFG% over the last 5 years. That's well below average.  Oh, and Young takes and makes more 3P attempts per game than Lou, all while maintaining a better 3P%.  Lou doesn't know that though, because he keeps forcing those 3s season after season after season. There's no way that's changing.  You're running out of excuses here."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,-4,Sun Jul 12 05:07:36 2015 UTC,"Or you can look at his entire career and see that he's shot .454% from two. He's not a good three point shooter and for whatever reason takes three a game for his career (Over five last year), and shoots at .341% for his career, but it together yourself.  Scott will cut down the number of threes he shoots, that's almost assured. And who careers if Nick Young shoots better from three? All he does is dribble out the clock and chuck up a long two or three. And yet, he STILL shoots worse than Lou. You're making excuses for Nick, not the other way around.  On top of that, Lou provides more playmaking than Nick would EVER dream of. This is no contest."
lakers,3cy9hz,NimbusIV,5,Sun Jul 12 05:12:57 2015 UTC,I like Nick more than alot of recent lakers that come to mind..I hope we keep him because he actually WANTS to be here.
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,-8,Sun Jul 12 02:55:57 2015 UTC,"Lol, he only wants to be here to expand his celebrity status, which is beyond shameful."
lakers,3cy9hz,NimbusIV,2,Sun Jul 12 04:11:36 2015 UTC,"what? lmao or maybe because this is where he's from and where his family stays. He doesn't need any ""fame status"" he's married to Iggy Azalea and Kendrick Lamar is his cousin"
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,-5,Sun Jul 12 05:24:00 2015 UTC,"Think about this dawg, do you REALLY think he'd be dating Iggy Azalea if he wasn't here, playing for the Lakers at that? Come on dude, when he was in Washington his nickname was ""The City"" for crying out loud. He only conjured up this gimmick when he played for the Clippers for half a season. Then he went to Philly the next year and once again he was lowkey, until he signed with the Lakers. Do you REALLY think he'd be having all these tv appearances and TMZ segments? Come on dude, smarten up. He's played up this gimmick since he's been here, and you suckers all fell for it hook, line and sinker."

lakers,3cy9hz,BuyAllTheVowels,3,Sun Jul 12 05:36:43 2015 UTC,"The problem with Nick is that his greatest strength is also his greatest weakness...he's a chucker. Don't get me wrong, when he goes off for 20pts on 8 of 12 because he got hot it's a great day, but I don't think we can play through the 8 games in between when he goes 3 for 15.   It was cool when we were tanking, but those FGA would be better served going to our younger guys now."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,-9,Sun Jul 12 00:37:50 2015 UTC,"It was never ""cool"". If we suck we suck, but don't be a damn shitshow and then have the audacity to be a clown about it."

lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,-1,Sun Jul 12 04:47:08 2015 UTC,High hopes? He's thirty. He never put it together and he's not going to get it. He's garbage.
lakers,3cy9hz,FreshDiamond,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:00:08 2015 UTC,Mitch was directly asked what he thought nicks role would be. What is he supposed to say NO I AM TRADING THAT TOOL BAG. He also added the term THIS YEAR  after calling nick a core player. He then went on to say how much he plays is up to Byron and nick has to do a better job of fitting into the system.
lakers,3cy9hz,FuriousFlex,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:49:15 2015 UTC,Lakers will trade him before trade deadline if they don't see swagy p. If we see high volume shots and clowning around he is gone.

lakers,3cy9hz,avengedteddy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:13:24 2015 UTC,Mitch has already said he's a core player for the team.    Classic move to increase value in a tradeable asset
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,-7,Sat Jul 11 23:19:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. Can't wait until we ship his ass out.
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:10:03 2015 UTC,I was exploring some possible trades for Nick Young and I came upon two interesting ones: http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=opk2l23 and http://espn.go.com/nba/tradeMachine?tradeId=odrmn3h. I figure we could just play Morris at the 3 since he's good at making outside shots.
lakers,3cy9hz,Notalent13,-7,Sun Jul 12 03:47:00 2015 UTC,"Phoenix would never do that, but I'd love just to get rid of him immediately."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,0,Sun Jul 12 04:12:29 2015 UTC,"Lou and Swaggy are mid season trade bait, I don't dislike them but that is their purpose, to get enough time to show off for playoff teams that need a 6th man scorer so the Lakers can get something in return.  Also for the record I don't dislike either, they are both good players, but neither fits our future."
lakers,3cy9hz,mralln,-4,Sat Jul 11 22:42:38 2015 UTC,Lou wasn't brought on for trade bait. I feel we believe we can raise his efficiency but cutting out on his number of threes. Nick Young is hopeless.
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,0,Sun Jul 12 04:15:33 2015 UTC,"Lots of chatter -- similar to with pau -- he's an asset that may help us get that one player who skills we la,ck -- the d or the 3 -- or just consistency; seems a lot depends on how it goes with Scott; that's the impression I get from the LA media"
lakers,3cy9hz,mralln,-6,Sat Jul 11 23:26:05 2015 UTC,"Except Pau helped his get two rings, come on now."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:10:23 2015 UTC,Sorry. I just thought it was obvious we were talking about trades and not rings ?  My bad
lakers,3cy9hz,mralln,-1,Sun Jul 12 09:14:07 2015 UTC,Nick's just a body. At this point just trade him to get his ass off the team.
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:25:08 2015 UTC,"Umm that's what my first post said weirdo :). Loving these lakers tho --- and who knows. Young could approve, but if he doesn't play both sides Scott won't use him n Mitch will flip him, as he should"
lakers,3cy9hz,mralln,-1,Sun Jul 12 10:29:32 2015 UTC,"We should have never signed him, but what should be FAR more aggressive in looking to move him. Send a message that as an organization that we don't accept that sort of foolishness."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:33:18 2015 UTC,Absolutely -- but he has length. Athleticism and ability to create his own shot -- with trade deadline in 2016. Makes sense to at least give him the chance to improve his d and consistency ya know ?
lakers,3cy9hz,mralln,0,Sun Jul 12 11:36:36 2015 UTC,"Length and athleticism are everything, otherwise Hasheem Thabet and Joe Alexander would have been All-Stars. In regards to creating his own shot, eh, all he does dribble at the three point line and chuck up a long two or three while dribbling out the shot clock.  Let's be honest, he's never going to improve on the defensive end or his consistency. He's thirty years old, this is who he is. We've got to get rid of him asap. Let him be another team's problem."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:20:03 2015 UTC,"Well I'm 30 n I'm definitely not a finished product ---  I think we can all grow and change if we're willing too ---  Nick Young has what Kobe gets knocked on -- having the confidence to take that shot, miss it n take it again --- a lot of players lack that confidence, over confidence can be toxic but maybe easier to reign it in than create it? Example would be Wes Johnson --- he lacked mentally what Young had --- Young provides versatility but he's certainly replaceable-- but only for someone who actually has above average d or 3 skill I would think ?"
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,-2,Sun Jul 12 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"Thirty in terms of basketball is the age at which you start to look down on the rest of your career. The average player is playing what, anywhere from three to six more years in the league. Nick Young has shown that he's not willing to grow his game as a player or at the least improve on his efficiency so that he's good at being a one trick pony.  There's a difference between having confidence and having an unrealistic view of yourself that you're actually better than you are. Nick Young is the former. I'd rather have Wesley Johnson than Nick Young, because at LEAST Wes will do other things on the floor. That's what I've always tried to get at."
lakers,3cy9hz,firestulantz,-9,Sun Jul 12 15:36:19 2015 UTC,"Fuck you OP, Nick Young is garbage and I can't wait until we ship his ass out. I can't wait until we trade his ass so I can blast all you suckers for worshiping a terrible player."
lakers,3cy9hz,WOX_69,0,Sun Jul 12 04:02:38 2015 UTC,"Nobody's worshipping anyone.  We just like the guy.  That you can't tell the difference says a lot.  Basketball is entertaining and I find Nick entertaining, win or lose or lower stats than Lou Williams or not.  I'm glad if he's hanging around on our bench, getting everyone going and occasionally dropping some 4-pt plays.  You, on the other hand, are not entertaining anyone, and you consistently calling Nick names speaks more about you than it does Nick.  Did he steal your girl or something?  You seem awful peeved at the guy, it can't just be because Nick has an inefficient shooting percentage.  What's the real reason for your incessant hate?  What happened to you?"
lakers,3d3don,AtheistAlien,27,Mon Jul 13 05:01:48 2015 UTC,"It shouldn't make anyone sick.  This photo should make you proud of your team.  This photo was taken during pre-draft workouts.  The Celtics took Antonie Walker with the #5 pick over Kobe Bryant in the draft.  The Lakers traded away one of the best centers in the league at the time (Vlade Divacs) to take the spunky kid. Even though we'd used Vlade to get to the finals.  This photo proves that Boston had a chance to take Kobe and should've recognized his greatness, but that they didn't. But our front office recognized a diamond in the rough so well that they crippled their team in the short-term (Magic was at about the same the stage Kobe is at now of his career) and traded away our starting center just to get him.  This photo is glorious because it shows that we bested our only rival in the NBA when they had the advantage. The same thing might happen with Marcus Smart and Julius Randle..."

lakers,3d3don,StealthRUs,2,Mon Jul 13 22:32:42 2015 UTC,"The Lakers traded away one of the best centers in the league at the time (Vlade Divacs) to take the spunky kid.   Ok.  Let's not go crazy now.  Vlade was good, but he wasn't one of the best.   Even though we'd used Vlade to get to the finals.   I think that was more of Magic's effort than Vlade."
lakers,3d3don,celtic-pride1,2,Mon Jul 13 17:00:32 2015 UTC,Let's not forget that Kobe's agent had made it known that kobe would play overseas if anyone but the Lakers drafted him.
lakers,3d3don,amarstan,-3,Mon Jul 13 05:50:34 2015 UTC,"1) prove that the agent stated that publicly and on the record and then sent his client to do a pre-draft work out for a team he was never going to play for, 2) stop making excuses for failure, 3) even when players make these sorts of threats, they sure as hell don't go and do a pre draft work out for the team, and the team always call their bluff and drafts them anyway.   So either your team was not able to assess his talent compared to Walker, lacked balls to challenge a 17 year old's bluff, or both."
lakers,3d3don,celtic-pride1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:09:55 2015 UTC,"I don't know how long you've been watching basketball but it's commin knowledge that Kobe was going to get picked by the Nets. He had multiple pre draft workouts with them.   Also, there's no need to be such an angry fan just because I'm a Celtics fan. Relax a bit and enjoy the god damned game. When the Celtics and Lakers rivalry sparks up again, then you can be an ass. Until then we're just two teams trying to escape the lottery and crawl our way to the top."
lakers,3d3don,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:18:13 2015 UTC,"Who did the nets end up getting?   Btw, I hope you know not all Lakers fans are bill Russell haters. This guy seems to be stuck in the past in the worst way. Russell in my opinion is in a clear top 5 with Wilt, Shaq, Kareem, and Olajuwon. But White players were good too you know :( what about mikan? Haha."
lakers,3d3don,amarstan,-2,Mon Jul 13 22:42:21 2015 UTC,"Common knowledge is just another way of saying a rumor. You've got no hard evidence where they actually said that Kobe would play in Europe if picked by the Celtics or another team.  Nobody's angry or an ass here. I'm just calling out your assumption and unfounded assertion. I'm shit talking your team on the Lakers sub, but it's all in good fun and topical. For god's sake, I admitted you were our rival even though Russell won all his titles when there where only a couple non-white guys in the league and only a handful of teams. It's all in good fun."

He told 710 why he thought the LMA free agency meetings didn't go so well. He talked about there being too many people and the table was round, and the radio guys hammered and criticized him all afternoon. That got me thinking, why was LMA's meeting so bad, but Carmelo's last year was so good? (aside from Melo going back to NYK)  I think Mitch is playing the media for chumps. As he should, all the media has done is criticize the Lakers FO, called his boss an idiot even though he knows better. Mitch is fed up with the media, and he'll treat them as they treated him."

lakers,3cwx89,midrangechange,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:09:31 2015 UTC,"Bass is a great role player. I've followed him his whole career. He works hard but has limitations. He's best used for 15-25 min a night off the bench.  He can defend in the post, but has trouble against athletic wings. On offense he can box out and rebound well. He also has a wicked pick-and-pop move and can nail a mid-range jumper off of it. So I can see him working well with Russell eventually.   He's a good player, but a very specific tool in the box.  Anthony Brown is the rookie we drafted to develop into the ideal 3&amp;D wing player. He's big, athletic, can nail the open three point shot. He can defend any of the perimeter positions and is actually able to finish at the rim on fast breaks. I really think he will be the steal of the draft and will be starting for us by mid-season.  Nance is more of a hustle and energy guy. He will be useful, but I don't see him going far unless he can develop a jump shot, which is something Brown already has."

lakers,3cz0fq,spudwinkle,8,Sun Jul 12 02:22:35 2015 UTC,I would not be surprised if they bring Randle along slowly and start Brandon Bass for a month or two.
lakers,3cz0fq,LauranceFuller,3,Sun Jul 12 05:56:47 2015 UTC,"As much and I want Randle to start I agree and think this is the best way to continue his progression - I just remember hearing someone during the first game mention Bass off the bench, which implies Randle starting."

lakers,3cz0fq,BerriesNCreme,2,Sun Jul 12 05:30:30 2015 UTC,"Young will probably come in for Kobe and they will look at Anthony Brown and test Randle at the 3 maybe as well. Lou will back up whoever rests between Russell and Clarkson, but man there are so many line up options here. I'd like to see those 5 together on the court too - run the young guys!!

I feel like a lot of Redditors do this just to stand out. Rabsho hated on Harrison Barnes so much he got ""famous"" and people brought him up whenever Barnes did really well or really bad. But Harrison Barnes helped win a fucking championship and Rabsho is just another dumb fucking hater who's never touching an NBA floor.   Wox, we fucking get it. You hate Nick Young. But he's better than you'll ever be. And you're not a professional analyst. So shut the fuck up already. Nobody cares your his number one hater all the time. We're not creating a subreddit to show all your stupid rants. We're just gonna keep down voting your snarky bullshit. Swag mother fucker. Drown in it."

You care FAR too much about my comments, and yet, you seem to give them more weight than you suggest you do; which really means you know deep down I speak the truth.  Do this just to stand out? Please. I've said this on every Laker holdout. RealGM Laker board, Lakersground, Lakernation, on Twitter, Facebook, this ain't a ""Reddit thing"", kid. I'm tired of you fucks who claim to be Laker fans deluding yourselves into believing that Nick Young is some good player. He's garbage, and the sooner YOU accept that, the better.  No, he will NEVER be better than I will be. At the end of it all, he's a lowly swagtard, and I am not. I don't give two shits if someone makes a subreddit about me or not. I do what I do. You keep downvoting, and that's fine, but you'll be forced to accept the truth sooner or later. And when we trade his ass, best believe I'ma let all you fools know.  Swag? No, fuck swag, kid, I don't deal with swagtard shit. Wherever there's a swagtard around, there's a person like me ready to whoop ass."

I hope his head is clear and doesn't get into trouble."
lakers,3cvvza,FuriousFlex,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:39:01 2015 UTC,his offensive skills will need development but his defensive mind and responsiveness to challenge each shot without fouling is top class! great pick up! can't wait to see the rest of pre season!

lakers,3cvvza,PatronSaintOfUpdog,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:13:42 2015 UTC,Seriously. I was completely sure he wouldn't play last night because Mitch said so. I hope we see more of him as SL goes on.
lakers,3cvvza,arch_wizard,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:22:21 2015 UTC,"Oh you will. You'll probably see him during the season as well. I watched him in college. (I went to Fresno state) and he was nuts. Not just blocking shots but making it difficult around the rim. I watched SL and it seemed like his timing was off. Once he gets it back and gets in shape, if his mi d his in the right place he should be looking like a first round pick in no time."

lakers,3cvvza,delscorch0,13,Sat Jul 11 05:48:34 2015 UTC,This is actually a third chance.
lakers,3cvvza,chequilla,6,Sat Jul 11 12:49:31 2015 UTC,"Eh, college doesn't count. Also, being a talented big man, he will absolutely get fourth and fifth and sixth chances if he screws up again.

lakers,3cvvza,JesusSama,9,Sat Jul 11 05:42:26 2015 UTC,"Yes and Upshaw got the same contract. But Upshaw has a different kind of potential than Harris, plus Harris was a huge complainer and felt like he was obligates to get more minutes."
lakers,3cvvza,jaysteezy24,7,Sat Jul 11 05:54:09 2015 UTC,"Basically, this contract is partially guaranteed and is going to try and keep Upshaw honest/focused on staying the course. Because, if he fucks up, he won't get the rest of the payday he could earn."

For example, OKC can't stay healthy, Phoenix can't score, Utah can't score, etc.   AND Kobe stays healthy. Which over the past 2 seasons I'm not overly optimistic about."

lakers,3cyzxg,kdotc,3,Sun Jul 12 01:52:05 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. While it's certainly exciting to look toward the future with our young core, I would definitely rather have the last few years of Kobe's career not be rebuilding ones. The old man shouldn't be going through this process at his age. and to watch him have to carry the load like he is is just sad to me. I would've liked the Kobe to have gone out a contender and not have to kill himself every year trying to do what he can no longer do. Tim Duncan and the Spurs would be an example of what I would've wanted for Kobe. All that combined with the fact that these new NBA fans (post lebron to Miami) think it's cool to be a laker hater just makes the overall perception of Kobe and his greatness and the greatness of the laker franchise incredibly skewed.   tl;dr I'm pumped to be on our way back to relevancy. But no, the rebuild wasn't fun and I wish things had gone differently for our organization after 2010."
lakers,3cyzxg,StealthRUs,0,Sun Jul 12 02:01:14 2015 UTC,Kobe did have a choice.  He could've not taken the Lakers' money and gone someplace that would've given him a better chance to contend.  He signed on knowing that title # 6 was never going to happen.
lakers,3cyzxg,megavino,2,Sun Jul 12 19:47:51 2015 UTC,"The rebuilding only really started midway through last year with clarkson and tarik black. If not for him, last year would have been useless to our development. Now the full blown rebuild starts. I'm excited for this youth movement."
lakers,3cyzxg,aznsniperx3,2,Sun Jul 12 02:25:23 2015 UTC,I hope the Lakers develop like the Thunder's did. They just grew better together each and every season. It's a shame that they've gotten hurt every year after their finals run. I hope they can be healthy this coming season.
lakers,3cyzxg,StealthRUs,0,Sun Jul 12 04:26:39 2015 UTC,We need one more year of tank to do something close to what OKC did.  We still don't have enough pieces.
lakers,3cyzxg,harrison5394,2,Sun Jul 12 19:48:51 2015 UTC,The last two seasons were less stressful than the 2012 season. Seeing your team miss the playoffs is a lot easier to swallow than making the playoffs and choking/underachieving.   Watching a losing team is a lot easier because there are no expectations and you get to see young guys develop. I'll gladly take the past 2 years over 2004 or 2008 where we lost in the finals. Going all that way and not getting the job done is a deep pain that never really goes away. The last two years were a temporary but necessary pain that has layed the groundwork for the next decade of Lakers basketball.
lakers,3cyzxg,AranciataExcess,2,Sun Jul 12 04:58:37 2015 UTC,Clarkson/D'Lo/Nance/Randle/Upshaw. They will grow together.  The future looks bright.

lakers,3cyzxg,Yellowyuuki,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:50:42 2015 UTC,I liked watching players try to make a case for being in the league on our team. My personal favorite was Jordan Hill been rooting for him to have his shot since he left Arizona.
lakers,3cyzxg,StealthRUs,0,Sun Jul 12 07:23:36 2015 UTC,"I've enjoyed the tank the past couple of years.  I just hate that we didn't fully commit to it either year.  We never should've entered 2013 with Gasol and Nash still on our roster and we shouldn't have given big minutes to guys like Chris Kaman, Jordan Hill, and Carlos Boozer who are actually decent NBA players that kept us from being truly awful.  Randle and Russell are nice acquisitions, but imagine if we had Jabari Parker and KAT instead."
lakers,3cxrhc,Cienes,7,Sat Jul 11 18:56:41 2015 UTC,I KNEW Clarkson's first 3 was really a 2!  Can someone remind me why he wasn't drafted higher though? I didn't watch him in college.
lakers,3cxrhc,PatronSaintOfUpdog,6,Sat Jul 11 19:00:01 2015 UTC,"He's definitely a first-round talent. His value was rising during college, had some break out games, and early projections said he could go in the first round, but his dad came down with a rare form of cancer. Clarkson had to support him and also start thinking of being the family's financial supporter, which resulted in a poor finish in college.  It's ironic (in a good way) that the things that lowered his stock -- the sudden realization he has to succeed in the NBA to take care of his family because of his father's condition -- are the things that push and drive Clarkson, perhaps more than other players, to raise his game. I think that's why he's improved so much with the Lakers. He was probably already a very self-motivated guy, but faced with the reality that his father could die (good news, his father seemed to have recovered now) really elevated his work ethic to near Kobe-like levels.  Here's an LA Times article on Clarkson and his dad, from earlier this year. http://www.latimes.com/sports/lakers/la-sp-lakers-jordan-clarkson-20150104-story.html"

lakers,3cy8ef,xkoalasx,9,Sun Jul 12 04:31:32 2015 UTC,"On paper they are better than last year's squad, but too many unknowns to know for sure to say how far they'll go. I'm still excited though.  With two former all-stars, a sixth-man-of-the-year winner, a solid veteran role-player, an all-rookie team member, two top-seeded draft picks, undrafted big man with top-seeded draft talent potential -- you'd think that would result in a team that would compete.  The talent and potential is there on this team, most definitely. But there is a lot of inexperience with the young guys (how well will the 1st year guys perform?) and injury concerns with our most talented star (Kobe) and with Randle coming off his injury, and only hope that our big men can perform -- one coming from a down year (Hibbert) and another who is raw (Upshaw).  If you mean compete by having more success. Then definitely. If you mean compete by making the playoffs -- there is a chance, a slim one if everything goes right for the Lakers.    Even though I'm trying to stay objective, I admit, it's hard not to resist the hype. It'll be a very fun team to watch."

lakers,3czy0j,bucketsquad18,9,Sun Jul 12 08:40:55 2015 UTC,"There were a few where either he made a pass a teammate wasn't ready for or it was a bit off, but those were mostly timing/chemistry things and shouldn't be much of a problem.   The more concerning ones, about 3-4 of them, were him driving in and due to a combination of not enough explosiveness and not that great handles, kind of ""getting stuck"" in the lane and either getting stripped right away or stuffed after an ineffective eurostep/lay-up attempt.  Part of it might be tiredness/conditioning, and it's only 2 summer league games, but it definitely seems like a legit weakness as of now. Plenty of guys in the league manage to drive effectively without being extremely explosive but it takes other skills.

But failing to give him a shot to develop next to Hibbert and utilize the resources of an Nba staff would be a damn shame.   He has Natural, instinctive defensive talent with a helluva physical frame.   Amen man. Give us Upshaw or give us death"

lakers,3cvd62,supremesamurai,13,Sat Jul 11 06:47:59 2015 UTC,"black was playing with serious hustle on both ends today.  randle showed some power, dlo did a little of everything, and clarkson made most wolves his bitch.    and yes.  the brief upshaw, was glorious.  im so so happy as a lakers fan.....what...what is this feeling...is....is this what they call ""hope""? it itches  (also solid play outta williams and nance)"
lakers,3cvd62,SDF05,2,Sat Jul 11 03:52:56 2015 UTC,Agreed.... Found Randle a bit rusty to start... Got going after awhile.... That Clarkson put back.... Goddaamn.
lakers,3cvd62,LauranceFuller,17,Sat Jul 11 05:06:05 2015 UTC,I don't know guys that would mean we have two Roberts on the team and that's 1 Robert too many.  ....RIP Sacre

lakers,3cvd62,SwaggyB23,2,Sat Jul 11 02:51:43 2015 UTC,Thank you Bobby Sacre for all the good times.  Maybe we can trade him home to Toronto for a future pick.
lakers,3cvd62,justgivingsomeadvice,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:52:33 2015 UTC,we just signed him lol
lakers,3cvd62,crawshay,2,Sat Jul 11 03:22:52 2015 UTC,yeah guaranteeing this coming year was probably the wrong move but hopefully it doesn't matter
lakers,3cvd62,supremesamurai,7,Sat Jul 11 04:02:01 2015 UTC,I will be shocked if Mitch doesn't offer him a contract. I like the fact that he didn't back down from KAT tonight. I also think he's only a little bit of seasoning away from being a solid bench player this season. FO would be making a mistake if they took the risk of letting him be in the D-League.
lakers,3cvd62,Fueled-By-Ramen,18,Sat Jul 11 02:51:44 2015 UTC,"He's still out of shape and I dont know if FO is fully convinced his attitude is transformed. Most likely he will make our training camp and preseason roster, but opening day he'll probably be on our D-League team, but just to get back in shape. Hopefully we can unload Kelly or Sacre to open up a spot for Upshaw"
lakers,3cvd62,SwaggyB23,9,Sat Jul 11 02:21:53 2015 UTC,"don't we have an open spot?  d'lo/ clarkson/ kobe/ randle/ hibbert  lou/ brown/ young/ brown/ nance/ black/ bass/ kelly/ sacre  leaves a spot for upshaw. unless we're looking for another 3 for when Kobe doesn't play, which would probably be wise lol."
lakers,3cvd62,supremesamurai,2,Sat Jul 11 02:39:57 2015 UTC,Kupchak had an interview today and he sounded really skeptical on him. He wasn't sure if they would  let him play today.
lakers,3cvd62,Schneeky,16,Sat Jul 11 02:48:18 2015 UTC,I think Mitch was playing him down on purpose.
lakers,3cvd62,NimbusIV,12,Sat Jul 11 02:52:30 2015 UTC,I heard that interview and after seeing Upshaw destroy I think you're right.
lakers,3cvd62,LauranceFuller,3,Sat Jul 11 02:53:26 2015 UTC,I thought so too. Lakers just want to see some action but not too much to get interest from other teams? Idk though because Upshaw made it clear he wanted to sign with lakers.
lakers,3cvd62,NimbusIV,5,Sat Jul 11 03:28:57 2015 UTC,Its safe to assume Dwight Buyuks makes the team again but I guess Upshaw can probably take that spot instead

lakers,3cvd62,clippjoint,5,Sat Jul 11 07:34:34 2015 UTC,He has a ton of time to get into shape. At least two months.
lakers,3cvd62,NicDwolfwood,6,Sat Jul 11 02:51:31 2015 UTC,"I usually don't hype for rookies, but not only was Upshaw a presence and a rim deterrent, the dude was straight electric.  I found myself hoping his man would shoot or a guard would penetrate and try a shot just to see if Upshaw could get it.  No wonder people were saying this guy could've been a lottery pick on talent alone."

lakers,3cvd62,diondrems,2,Sat Jul 11 13:15:59 2015 UTC,"Yay! Mitch signed Upshaw!! So much for him being a longshot. he made an immediate impression.  If an out of shape, rusty player could do what he did tonight in limited minutes, i can only imagine when he's played more and is in better shape"
lakers,3cvd62,clippjoint,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:01:23 2015 UTC,"Mitch said today something like that he was far away from consideration and has a lot of work to do still, I don't think he makes the roster, we have only 1 roster spot and 3 centers already."
lakers,3cvd62,Cienes,20,Sat Jul 11 02:21:56 2015 UTC,get rid of sacre
lakers,3cvd62,TheAsianMamba,8,Sat Jul 11 02:27:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah really, Sacre is a flaming piece of garbage, Upshaw has his issues but even this contribution is better than Sacre. He has a high high upside."
lakers,3cvd62,Yeetzus,15,Sat Jul 11 02:47:33 2015 UTC,Sacre is virtually useless. A glorified mascot.   Upshaw is a young rim-protecting prospect that you can lock up for cheap and develop in the D-league.
lakers,3cvd62,arch_wizard,9,Sat Jul 11 02:34:03 2015 UTC,"3 centers already   So long, Sacre. It's been fun!"
lakers,3cvd62,3ey3s,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:26:25 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this is what actually happens but I hope we give him a spot, he certainly has a ceiling worthy of it. I can see attitude issues become a concern but he seems to really be trying and willing to put in work."
lakers,3cx0hz,PaulKr,7,Sat Jul 11 14:55:20 2015 UTC,Looking forward to see how Okafor matches up against Upshaw and Nance. This game will definitely help assuage any lingering doubts for Lakers fans.
lakers,3cx0hz,KookLife,4,Sat Jul 11 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"Add tarik black to that list, he'll have primary duties guarding Okafor. I want black to shut him down."
lakers,3cx0hz,Titanosaurus,5,Sat Jul 11 19:15:16 2015 UTC,I want Upshaw to shut him down too lol but Okafor really wanted to be a Lakers. Sucks we couldn't grab him too.

lakers,3cx0hz,spudwinkle,8,Sat Jul 11 19:07:44 2015 UTC,He just came from an injury so they don't want to push him that hard.
lakers,3cx0hz,lolxddavid,6,Sat Jul 11 21:49:12 2015 UTC,Leg and foot. They don't want to over exert him till they're comfortable he's healed.
lakers,3cx0hz,Titanosaurus,3,Sat Jul 11 19:16:08 2015 UTC,"Ahh, figured so. He looked pretty rusty (understandable though) in yesterday's game. We've waited so long to see him play I don't want him to miss any games lol - but for health definitely."
lakers,3cx0hz,spudwinkle,3,Sat Jul 11 21:07:11 2015 UTC,He didlookrusty but wow he was bullying in the paint. If he was 7 feet he would be shaq 2.0.  Either way he looks leaner and bigger at the same time. Man I can't wait 3 years from now so these boys are developed and ready to make noise in the playoffs
lakers,3cx0hz,FuriousFlex,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:01:19 2015 UTC,"For those watching on TV - was anyone else frustrated with Reggie Miller and his analysis of Julius? Now I love Reggie, but he kept saying Julius looks like he put on weight since he had a lower body injury, but we Lakers fans know he lost weight - about 15-20 pounds. Man for some reason that shit just got me and they didn't let it go and kept talking about it for like 10 minutes! The man hit the gym, bulked up, but leaned out as well. He looks good, not fat and out of shape - damn Regg."
lakers,3cx0hz,spudwinkle,2,Sat Jul 11 23:54:06 2015 UTC,Haters gonna hate. Randle looks leaner and a bit bigger. He was fast had speed and bullied in the paint. Reggie wtf was he smoking.
lakers,3cx0hz,FuriousFlex,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:04:35 2015 UTC,"I was surprised he was announcing the game actually, and thought it would be a couple people we wouldn't recognize - like the guy who was doing ""play-by-play"" beside Reggie (no clue who he was). Also seemed like they were just filling in the empty spaces in the broadcast with verbal diarrhea. Oh well - here's to a healthy Lakers squad!"
lakers,3cx0hz,spudwinkle,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:10:05 2015 UTC,They want to gradually bring him back because of the injury.

lakers,3cvoe8,vinjhup,6,Sat Jul 11 05:10:28 2015 UTC,People were saying he had good stats because he was on a bad roster. He balled out in this game.
lakers,3cvoe8,FuriousFlex,7,Sat Jul 11 09:45:52 2015 UTC,That argument is almost always bullshit. He got those stats playing against other NBA teams.

lakers,3cvoe8,Andrew_Korenchkin,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:04:57 2015 UTC,"Clarkson and Russell are going to be one of the best back courts in the future. With that being said, Randle needs to slow the fuck down. He is so strong and has all this potential yet he is so anxious.

lakers,3d0wr1,nighthawk88000,3,Sun Jul 12 20:35:54 2015 UTC,Larry has been fucking awesome in summer league. If he plays like this once the season starts were in for some fun games.

lakers,3d0wr1,TimeisIllmatic95,8,Sun Jul 12 18:34:11 2015 UTC,Kobe is not a sensitive person. Plus he's here for one more year anyways. It's not a big deal.
lakers,3d0wr1,mes8007,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:44:00 2015 UTC,Lol why are you arguing a point that you just apoligized for on your title... And its people like you that make laker fans look bad. Dont just judge people you dont know. Everyone has said or done something they wish they can take back. Were all human and we all make mistakes. Everyone would be a god if we cant make a mistake.

lakers,3d0wr1,javi2123,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:20:16 2015 UTC,How is someone a cancer over a tweet about a player they happened to not like at one point? That's probably one of the dumbest things I've just read. People say crap they regret all the time and even about people they don't know. Does it make right? No. What makes him any different? Because he's an NBA player now? Your point is invalid lol.
lakers,3d0wr1,BraveFencerMusashi,-11,Sun Jul 12 18:00:43 2015 UTC,"He talked mad shit on LeBron (who would smash Nance in a 1on1) and called Kobe a rapist.. if you don't think that can be a 'negative' in the locker-room, then you're an idiot.. but then again you're like 15.. you'll figure it out someday"
lakers,3d0wr1,locallyunknown,5,Sun Jul 12 18:04:25 2015 UTC,"Actually the idiot would be any adult who held a grudge over a college kid for something  irresponsibly said on social media years ago. Many kids says things on on social media for fun trolling aspects. And we are just now reaching a point of seeing the long term consequences of trolling for fun at a young age.  Larry nance wasnt making a political statement in that tweet. He was just being a typical young brainless kid learning with the rest of us. Doesnt excuse his actions, but lets not act like anyone should have taken his comments any more serious than other trolls online searching for RTs or laughs.  Also Let's not forget social media hasn't been around long and many are learning by trail and error how to tread these waters. Particularly the younger generation who is now the first generation to see the long term consequences of trolling and posting/saying inappropriate things online as they go from kids to adults. Everyone is learning and the next Generation will be better equipped with how to handle themselves on social media. As a product of the first young generation to use social media; (I was in college when fb and twitter became popular, hs for myspace). I witnessed many of my friends hop on fb or twitter etc and say/post things just for the heck of it not even understanding there could be consequences. Older now I realize how dumb it was to had not even realized as kid, but that's apart of growing up. Doing dumb things, only difference is my generation did dumb things online."

Seems like you're confused about the term ""cancer."" Lmao, and I am 15? Why? Because I don't agree w/ what you are saying and challenging you? Ok, I'll be 15 then (even though that's not my age).

lakers,3cuzew,dc041894,28,Sat Jul 11 05:51:44 2015 UTC,"With the final seconds of this game ticking away, the Lakers (and us) have a lot of positives to take away from it.  Clarkson looks ah-maze-ing. Someone in this thread wrote he was the steal of last year's draft, and that's an argument that could absolutely stand up if his play tonight (or better) becomes his standard.  Russell is a real point guard, a team guy, a natural leader, and a player. He's also young, he was inconsistent tonight, and it's his first NBA action - albeit in a Summer League game. He could be a huge star, and the Lakers seem indeed to have an exciting backcourt tandem going forward.  Randle is rusty, but he shows flashes of insane strength and agility for a man his size. It's likely he'll play some 3 this season, and I imagined when we were still in the running for Aldridge that the team was pitching Aldridge at the 4 and Randle playing the 3. He's got great size to play that position and should be able to overpower guys. His shot was shaky as hell tonight, but that's probably nerves and when he settles down the man will be downright dangerous on the floor.  Tarik Black is still not ready for primetime. He's got tons of energy and can board like a beast. His interior defense is shaky, however, and he has a way of disappearing at times. This is, in my opinion, a make-or-break year for Black, so it will be interesting to see how he develops.  Upshaw is long and he can play defense. He also has some nice post moves. The talent is there. He also makes questionable decisions and looked out of control at times (understandably). Can he be a consistent player in this league? Time will tell, but the guy has a 7'5"" wingspan and a nice feel for the game.  Anthony Brown can shoot and play defense. He had a quiet game, but he played consistently well and if tonight is any indication he has a future in the league as a steady journeyman at least.   Larry Nance Jr. is fun to watch, but he's a project.  All in all a nice showing from the squad, despite the loss. Looking forward to the next game."
lakers,3cuzew,exsisto,27,Sat Jul 11 02:42:34 2015 UTC,I love Russell + Jordan tandem so much already. Feel like a giddy little girl.
lakers,3cuzew,bul1dog,5,Sat Jul 11 00:40:35 2015 UTC,"Right?  I withheld saying anything until I saw them a bit, but we might really have something special here in the back-court."
lakers,3cuzew,sharkytowers76,51,Sat Jul 11 00:44:06 2015 UTC,clarkson makes me so happy.
lakers,3cuzew,sunstersun,25,Sat Jul 11 01:19:19 2015 UTC,"Nance Jr is hustling. He's everywhere, that's exactly his role so looking good so far."

lakers,3cuzew,arkansastraffic,6,Sat Jul 11 02:35:16 2015 UTC,we had a glimpse of russell to clarkson..that would have been the highlight of the summer!
lakers,3cuzew,igoforthejugular,7,Sat Jul 11 01:27:11 2015 UTC,"Minnesota leads by six after the first half. Lakers look fluid at times on offense, but are struggling defensively. Despite being down at the half (and only by six), the buzzer went off and Russell went out slapping hands with his teammates and clearly looking to keep spirits and energy high. Not easy to do when they may be disappointed with the way they played during the first half, with Randle looking shaky in his first action in a year and the squad working to find itself on both ends of the court (moreso defensively), but it's good to see him getting out there and being a leader."
lakers,3cuzew,exsisto,6,Sat Jul 11 01:28:00 2015 UTC,Jordan Clarkson looks so in control. It's effortless for him. He and Russell have insane chemistry. Russell is looking for Clarkson and Clarkson moves off the ball beautifully.
lakers,3cuzew,exsisto,3,Sat Jul 11 01:31:38 2015 UTC,JC is the pain to guard I bet. You can't take your eyes off of him. His off the ball movement is on point.
lakers,3cuzew,santokimilktea,6,Sat Jul 11 01:45:51 2015 UTC,"Clarkson is a man amongst boys out there, damn son he was already good but he definitely was working on his game in the offseason. Steal of last years' draft."

lakers,3cuzew,Doocane,12,Sat Jul 11 02:16:08 2015 UTC,"after seeing that charge on towns, I'm convinced that you could get bruised ribs guarding randle"
lakers,3cuzew,ByTheBeardOfBruce,8,Sat Jul 11 02:31:26 2015 UTC,"Obviously Randle is no LeBron, but sometimes that comparison pops up legitimately because both are players that have the unique combo of size, speed, and strength that that intimidates defenders enough to have them think twice about getting in their way. That's a powerful mental effect on your opposition."

lakers,3cuzew,exsisto,6,Sat Jul 11 01:32:06 2015 UTC,"A couple observations  Nance is going to be really fun to watch. I can tell he just wants to posterize someone. I like that thinking  Russell has amazing court vision.  It's fun seeing this in an NBA setting  Black has outplayed Upshaw so far, but this is probably to be expected during the first game."
lakers,3cuzew,nijikon5,6,Sat Jul 11 00:59:17 2015 UTC,"And here comes Russell out of the half. The guy is determined to play this team into contention all by himself. Dribble drives to the basket gets by two men for a highly contested layup, then puts in an eighteen footer from the right of the key, grabs a rebound on the other end of the floor and delivers to Tarik Black in the key for a foul.

lakers,3cuzew,ape_cage,6,Sat Jul 11 01:14:17 2015 UTC,Reggie got REKT
lakers,3cuzew,exsisto,4,Sat Jul 11 01:14:45 2015 UTC,"Halftime thoughts:   Randle: Plays too much ISO ball, looks rusty. Doing pretty well getting to the rim but not finishing. Chalk to up to rust at this point, but not playing well in the first half. Russell: Looks pretty solid thus far, some great passes and a nice 3. Slacks on D sometimes, a few bricks, but overall playing smart. And looks so damn smooth doing it. Clarkson: Made some mistakes early but has been one of the best players on our side. Missed dunk was unfortunate, but it happens."
lakers,3cuzew,hollyw00dhustle,6,Sat Jul 11 01:15:10 2015 UTC,Russell commanding the floor. He's looking to Madsen for offensive plays in the half-court and then running them to perfection.
lakers,3cuzew,ape_cage,6,Sat Jul 11 01:18:59 2015 UTC,"I know Randle could dribble, but he needs to let D'Lo run that point."
lakers,3cuzew,exsisto,5,Sat Jul 11 01:34:24 2015 UTC,Randle DEFINITELY needed to finish that.
lakers,3cuzew,ashishvp,6,Sat Jul 11 02:11:52 2015 UTC,Black pulling down boards but not the ones that matter. Kind of quixotic.

lakers,3cuzew,ape_cage,5,Sat Jul 11 01:48:25 2015 UTC,"I'm as impressed by Clarkson's defense as I am by his offense. He looks like a man among boys out there, and that's probably due in large part to this being his second season. Zach Lavine, who failed to impress in '14-'15, looks similarly good. Coincidence?"
lakers,3cuzew,nochill95,4,Sat Jul 11 01:48:39 2015 UTC,"It takes different guys different amounts of time to adjust to the league. 1 season with this much progress is pretty damn quick, honestly."

lakers,3cuzew,thevisitor,3,Sat Jul 11 00:58:34 2015 UTC,I think Upshaw should have gotten that defensive rebound
lakers,3cuzew,DatsunYolo,3,Sat Jul 11 00:59:28 2015 UTC,Not a lot of tarik black recognition on this site or in general. I think he has a chance to be an all star.

lakers,3cuzew,Iyace,3,Sat Jul 11 01:04:30 2015 UTC,Towns has great vision man. That was a solid pass
lakers,3cuzew,ape_cage,3,Sat Jul 11 01:09:38 2015 UTC,Why clarkson keep holding his dick?
lakers,3cuzew,bmarshall12,10,Sat Jul 11 01:11:45 2015 UTC,IT'S FUCKING HUGE THAT'S WHY
lakers,3cveu5,sunstersun,63,Sat Jul 11 02:31:21 2015 UTC,Clarkson played like a beast. Julius on the other hand does need to get a rhythm for his game considering he hasn't played an actual game for a whole year so I'm not too worried. Can't wait to see them again tomorrow.
lakers,3cveu5,weyerwall,14,Sat Jul 11 02:35:04 2015 UTC,"Randle was rusted. He will get back into it. Great time to brush off the rust and he be ready when the season starts. I felt like last year during pre season he was more complete and ready to play. He will get it back. Upshaw Idk, he seems he needs time to get back into shape and get his timing. The defense he blocked towns wow I mean blocking another center ... Russel passed more shot okay. I think he is adjusting. I want him to be a bit more agressive but in time he will step up his game."
lakers,3cveu5,FuriousFlex,8,Sat Jul 11 02:52:31 2015 UTC,"I know that Randle needs a few games to get back into it, but I dislike how once he puts his head down it's all or nothing.  It slows down the tempo of the offense, but once his shots start falling, it would be valuable to have a go-to offensive weapon like him"
lakers,3cveu5,the_wheyfinder,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:00:13 2015 UTC,It's very predictable and annoying how he doesn't even look to pass as the defense collapses on him.
lakers,3cveu5,KobeHardensMyDirk,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:05:38 2015 UTC,"dude was strong.  he only flashed strength when going for a basket, not much finesse, but boy did he push people back.  missed open shots, but still"
lakers,3cveu5,CmonTouchIt,21,Sat Jul 11 04:31:33 2015 UTC,"Don't compare randle to a sophomore like JC. Randle's comparison are the other rookies, especially compared to KAT."
lakers,3cveu5,Titanosaurus,8,Sat Jul 11 02:57:30 2015 UTC,"Seriously. And on the other hand people say shit like ""he's rusty, he'll get back into it""."" Get back into what? Dude didn't play a single game yet."
lakers,3cveu5,muffhug,10,Sat Jul 11 03:13:25 2015 UTC,Clarkson showed us that he's been working on his game. No settling! Kobe is contaminating him with that outbreak virus.
lakers,3cveu5,readem_n_weep,76,Sat Jul 11 03:12:06 2015 UTC,Upshaw. That is all.
lakers,3cveu5,rl3191,34,Sat Jul 11 02:36:29 2015 UTC,"Upshaw played pretty beastly and he wanted to show up big and take it to Towns which is good. He was a bit unwieldy and a little out of control at times, makes me worry about his mental state on the court when he would be a bit to aggressive but it seemed like he really just wanted to do a good job and impress people.  If he keeps it up he could be an incredible rim protector. Amazing size, strength, determination and length, jesus christ."
lakers,3cveu5,zawmbie5,17,Sat Jul 11 02:45:41 2015 UTC,He played against one of the best big men in the summer league. It gets easier now.
lakers,3cveu5,readem_n_weep,2,Sat Jul 11 02:54:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's impressive, doesn't make his mistakes that are rooted in immaturity any less worrying. We should keep monitoring him but I hope we offer him a spot"
lakers,3cveu5,zawmbie5,6,Sat Jul 11 02:56:52 2015 UTC,its not immaturity its him trying to out do himself. If you ever played basketball and heard a cheer after a play you get really hype and after that you get over aggressive he just plays with too much emotion is what it is which can be a good thing and a bad thing.
lakers,3cveu5,NimbusIV,3,Sat Jul 11 03:11:39 2015 UTC,Playing with too much emotion that you make boneheaded decisions and fouls is almost literally the definition of basketball immaturity.   I play competitively and absolutely know the feeling of getting too psyched and making dumb mistakes but I also know that's not a good thing. As I said it's good he's enthusiastic and putting in effort but he needs to learn to control himself better
lakers,3cveu5,zawmbie5,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:18:00 2015 UTC,"Think about it he wants a spot, its his first game in the NBA, hes going against the number 1 pick who he happens to be a big man who also happens to be the one hes guarding.  When i thought he was being too hype is when he was setting screens other than that he was just showing grit and poise to make a statement that he's in the game."
lakers,3cveu5,NimbusIV,0,Sat Jul 11 03:26:48 2015 UTC,"I don't get what you don't understand. Clearly it's understandable for him to be nervous and make mistakes, that doesn't mean it's a good thing.  Yes he was bafoonish setting screens running over like a mad man and fouling, that coupled with some hard hits are what I'm talking about. He played very well for the most part, just those mistakes need to be eliminated if he wants a Roster spot."
lakers,3cveu5,zawmbie5,2,Sat Jul 11 03:31:18 2015 UTC,"I understand fully what you're saying I'm also not saying its a good thing no need to downvote me and act as if I'm totally oblivious to the fact that he made bad plays. I'm just listing the reasons why he might have made those bad decisions he wants it so bad that he's not thinking rationally while playing we are saying the same thing bro, I'm just saying its not immaturity its being caught up in the moment.  you have a good one man haha."
lakers,3cveu5,NimbusIV,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:36:32 2015 UTC,"I don't see what the disagreement is then, I stated from the beginning I understand why he made mistakes just that they need to stop. I guess I took some offense to the 'if you ever played basketball comment.' No reason for a disagreement when we're basically saying the same thing.  You too."
lakers,3cveu5,zawmbie5,2,Sat Jul 11 03:41:04 2015 UTC,Except he's plays Okafor next so he's got another big challenge tonight
lakers,3cveu5,DoctorJared,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:45:53 2015 UTC,That should be fun to watch
lakers,3cveu5,readem_n_weep,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:54:14 2015 UTC,"kind of, except we have okafor and prozingis next"
lakers,3cveu5,readem_n_weep,2,Sat Jul 11 12:03:58 2015 UTC,Like I said... Welcome to the NBA
lakers,3cveu5,jasterisfett,8,Sat Jul 11 13:53:35 2015 UTC,"Dude is auditioning right now. He's out to prove something and likely will be all season. He knows he fucked up in the past and really wants to earn his place. He's out of control, but that will be great for the team this season."
lakers,3cveu5,zawmbie5,2,Sat Jul 11 02:53:11 2015 UTC,"Yes that's pretty much exactly what I said. The only thing is being out of control with his mentality is not a good thing, enthusiasm is good but he needs to get under control."
lakers,3cveu5,readem_n_weep,2,Sat Jul 11 02:57:34 2015 UTC,Robert MWP Upshaw
lakers,3cveu5,CmonTouchIt,3,Sat Jul 11 03:09:13 2015 UTC,"tis one game.  upside can be realized, and mistakes can be fixed.  upshaw>sacre mitchplz"
lakers,3cveu5,SDF05,11,Sat Jul 11 04:30:45 2015 UTC,"Man, those blocks.....especially the one against KAT and the staredown..."
lakers,3cveu5,readem_n_weep,5,Sat Jul 11 02:45:37 2015 UTC,And that is a rusty Upshaw that hasn't played much since getting kicked off his team.
lakers,3cveu5,oOoleveloOo,2,Sat Jul 11 03:08:06 2015 UTC,He is only on a summer league contract right now... aka an unrestricted free agent. Just give him the contract mitch.
lakers,3cveu5,supremesamurai,2,Sat Jul 11 04:47:18 2015 UTC,"I really hope he doesn't get swooped up by another team. I hope Kerr, the Atlanta coach, and Gentry weren't there to see him in action."
lakers,3cveu5,aveydey,7,Sat Jul 11 02:45:23 2015 UTC,They absolutely were.  Remember when Mitch said he wasn't sure Upshaw would play tonight? Maybe they were afraid to let other coaches see him play...
lakers,3cveu5,mr-fiend,20,Sat Jul 11 03:07:38 2015 UTC,"I was very happy with everyone. Except Randle. Quite a few things about that game I didn't like. For a start, one freaking rebound? No defensive rebounds? Then his finishing...always gets past the guy and then usually misses. He's got a lot of work to do on the mental aspect of the game. Of course. It's one game."
lakers,3cveu5,readem_n_weep,7,Sat Jul 11 02:37:33 2015 UTC,He needs to work on finishing with his right.
lakers,3cveu5,yungJoc,4,Sat Jul 11 02:45:55 2015 UTC,He needs to get in position and get that ball down low. He was starting from the perimeter all night.
lakers,3cveu5,NimbusIV,8,Sat Jul 11 02:58:06 2015 UTC,"Ya he had horrible body language, and looked sluggish on offense like he was just waiting for someone to pass it to him.   He needs to be more mobile"
lakers,3cveu5,FuriousFlex,2,Sat Jul 11 02:55:06 2015 UTC,"It seemed like he didn't move well without the ball you're right but he didn't look sluggish to me. He looked like he was losing track on where he needed to be, his step was great fast as hell in fact.  His problem was that he keeps driving with his head down, this does 2 things...it lets the defender know hes going straight to the basket(sadly he wasn't finishing needs to soften up the touch in the paint) and that passing just isn't an option when he gets in that mode and if he does pass its going to be off target because he can't really see anything. He looked great besides missing the easy finishes, we will have to do if he does the same things next game or changes."
lakers,3cveu5,Rhyme_Pays,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:22:16 2015 UTC,I think they put Randle at the 3? I think he is more comfy at the 4 and he has a lot of rust prob some nervousness too.  He will get back into it.
lakers,3cveu5,TuneHD,2,Sat Jul 11 02:55:52 2015 UTC,"He played the 4 all game, I agree with the rust though. The moves were fine, just lacked some polish. Showcased his absurd strength which was nice to see"
lakers,3cveu5,tcorb95,0,Sat Jul 11 04:27:07 2015 UTC,"I chalk it up to rust and needing more time. I said the same thing about Clarkson last year, the moves and all were there, just wasn't finishing when he was playing off the bench. Once he got real minutes and time he started to finish the same shots he was bricking constantly."
lakers,3cveu5,virji24,13,Sat Jul 11 03:23:22 2015 UTC,"Randle forced the action sometimes but it was obvious he was rusty. Russell looked good, Clarkson looked great. I liked what I saw out of Upshaw and I hope we give him a contract. I liked the way Nance crashed the boards and Brown showed potential to be a reliable 3-PT shooter. I kind of expected us to lose going in just because Minnesota's summer league team is STACKED. But overall there were a lot of positives and I can't wait to watch these guys grow over the season."
lakers,3cveu5,ape_cage,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:41:14 2015 UTC,We still held our own till late despite Randle playing poorly
lakers,3cveu5,yungJoc,41,Sat Jul 11 04:23:46 2015 UTC,"A. Brown: Nothing overly negative or positive to say. He played well, didn't make any big mistakes, but missed some shots he should've made.  J. Randle: Frustrating to watch today because he'd do something awesome, followed by 5 dumb mistakes. Right now I'm chalking it up to rust and nerves coming back from injury, but overall underwhelming. I think some of his poor plays may be due to his role in summer league, which seemed more geared towards a SF. Randle is clearly still a PF [for now.]  T. Black: Great game from Tarik. Played with hustle and scooped up 13 rebounds.  J. Clarkson: Most definitely the star of our squad tonight. Along with Lavine, he looked like he was playing a tier above everyone else. Very excited for his future.  D. Russell: Lots to be excited about here as well. Played surprisingly good defense and his passing was about as beautiful as we've been hearing. Needs to get his shot going and looked tired near the end, but with conditioning I think he'll be set.  L. Nance Jr.: Satisfied with how he played, especially considering how early we drafted him. Total hustle man, plays hard and smart. Extremely athletic.  D. Buycks: Total scrub that played badly.  R. Upshaw: Definite flashes of promise, some dumb mistakes. One very sick block.  T. Mitchell: Hit a nice 3, but not much else to say otherwise.  Refs: Complete shit."
lakers,3cveu5,OMJuan,38,Sat Jul 11 02:42:46 2015 UTC,Buycks seemed decent at defense and could play hard
lakers,3cveu5,Exoandy,11,Sat Jul 11 02:53:26 2015 UTC,Buycks on D was fun to watch!
lakers,3cveu5,jasterisfett,-12,Sat Jul 11 03:29:11 2015 UTC,He sucks.
lakers,3cveu5,ghostOGkush,9,Sat Jul 11 04:03:33 2015 UTC,"Mitchell and Buycks are there for the energy and hustle. Not great scorers, middling defenders, but they'll sacrifice a lot of themselves for the team. Its like having Turiaf, but much smaller."
lakers,3cveu5,PuffyVatty,3,Sat Jul 11 02:55:30 2015 UTC,Ronnie price lol
lakers,3cveu5,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,0,Sat Jul 11 14:30:39 2015 UTC,"Buycks played very hard, his hustle was amazing. Earned some possessions that way. Actually think he did well for himself. Nance Jr on the other hand did not look like a first round talent imo. He seemed overwhelmed to me. Would have been satisfied with the hustle if he was a 2nd rounder or undrafted guy, but for a guy drafted this early I found it a bit underwhelming honestly. Just one game though, and the athleticism is there."
lakers,3cveu5,PaperDesk,9,Sat Jul 11 10:51:45 2015 UTC,"Everyone was good except Randle.  His defense was garbage. I love the kid but holy shit he was just lazy, didn't even box out. I'm disappointed and I was expecting him to bad on D lol. His passing was meh. He didn't really show off the handle everyone talked about but he's very comfortable with the ball for a big man. Also his inefficient bully-my-way-to-the-paint game hasn't changed although I'm sure highlights will make him look like a god. But on a positive note, this dude is freaking quick, everyone knows he's strong, but to recover from his injury looking just as fast as last year is very promising. His drop-step was sexy too.  This was just one game and I think Randle can at least become a mediocre defender in the near future."
lakers,3cveu5,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,3,Sat Jul 11 02:42:45 2015 UTC,It was his first real game in about a year. I wouldn't read to much into it :p
lakers,3cveu5,PaperDesk,2,Sat Jul 11 03:00:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's probably super rusty, I'm hoping for some improvement on D, his offense will get sorted out as he matures. I hate people who put a lot of value into preseason and summer league, yet I'm doing the same thing... I hate what I've become."
lakers,3cveu5,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Sat Jul 11 03:17:46 2015 UTC,"Ha ha, it's fun to speculate! I just don't want to lock Randle down into any one thing until we have some games of him. I can't wait until the season so we can see how he will do against the pros. He probably just need a couple games to get use to the pace again."
lakers,3cveu5,monsteratnatedotcom,8,Sat Jul 11 03:31:26 2015 UTC,Someone on /r/nba said Russell's handles didn't look smooth.   Only caught the 2nd half and wasn't really paying attention to that. Thoughts on the comment?
lakers,3cveu5,SDF05,7,Sat Jul 11 02:41:09 2015 UTC,"You could tell he was trying to reckon with the speed of the game. He's a guy who tries to control the tempo, his minutes were parceled out, and he was moving a little slow as a result, but he was mature out there and looked good. He's an unorthodox guy, unique, with an atypical handle, but that's his strength. It would be foolish to criticize the way he approaches his handle, because that skill, more than anything, is what defines him as a player. He's an artist with the ball. We look set for the future."
lakers,3cveu5,supremesamurai,7,Sat Jul 11 02:48:40 2015 UTC,Handles were okay and average. Didn't try to be too fancy and moved up the ball pretty well. But the shots weren't falling for him today.
lakers,3cveu5,readem_n_weep,6,Sat Jul 11 02:44:17 2015 UTC,"He looked great from the small minutes he got, and being his first game. I'm excited. He hit JC on a sweet no look alley oop.  So no, don't give that comment any juice."
lakers,3cveu5,sharkytowers76,2,Sat Jul 11 02:47:17 2015 UTC,Probably a hater
lakers,3cveu5,blackhillsgold,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:01:57 2015 UTC,Don't pay any attention to that comment.  He was in control and got to where he needed to be.  He was better than I thought on D even though he got lost a few times.
lakers,3cveu5,notsurewhatiam,0,Sat Jul 11 04:53:46 2015 UTC,He dribbles high and looks a little slow out there on the pick and roll.  I actually didn't like the look of it.  Maybe Nash can school him a bit if he feels like comin round.

lakers,3cveu5,lakers__sad_summer,12,Thu Jul 16 20:50:41 2015 UTC,Most of the guys looked good. Randle looked better as the game went on. Nothing really outstanding from LNJ.
lakers,3cveu5,santokimilktea,10,Sat Jul 11 02:35:05 2015 UTC,The game slipped away when Upshaw got subbed out in 3Q and never went back in. Coach Madson over complicated things.
lakers,3cveu5,ceyenoq,26,Sat Jul 11 02:36:22 2015 UTC,If they really wanted to win they would have Kobe play in the summer league. They don't care about W's they want to try out different lineups. Run various plays to see how each player performs. Look for synergies. Etc.
lakers,3cveu5,arkansastraffic,3,Sat Jul 11 02:53:53 2015 UTC,"I saw it this way too, also I don't think they wanted to risk anything happening to these guys playing too long."
lakers,3cveu5,lakers__sad_summer,2,Sat Jul 11 03:07:27 2015 UTC,"Mitch probably told Madsen to pull him if he was having too much of an impact. He didn't want Upshaw to be surrounded by offers from other teams.  They still signed him, though, so I guess the plan didn't work."

lakers,3cveu5,OoiDaBoi,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:28:42 2015 UTC,I think at these games it's more about looking what these players can do than winning. We can win all we want later. Important part is figuring out the combo of players that gel together.
lakers,3cveu5,weyerwall,33,Sat Jul 11 02:58:30 2015 UTC,"randle didnt look as good as i thought he was going to look, but everyone else played well."
lakers,3cveu5,buhhboyy,25,Sat Jul 11 02:34:32 2015 UTC,"he didn't look good, but we saw those glimpses."
lakers,3cveu5,supremesamurai,27,Sat Jul 11 02:35:15 2015 UTC,We also have to acknowledge the fact that he has not played an actual competitive game in almost a year.
lakers,3cveu5,BABYPUBESS,20,Sat Jul 11 02:36:15 2015 UTC,"He hasn't played in almost a year, how could you not expect him to be a bit rusty? Just saying."
lakers,3cveu5,Titanosaurus,10,Sat Jul 11 02:38:17 2015 UTC,"C'mon, he didn't play 5 v 5 until a few weeks ago. How would you not expect him to look rusty.  Aside from that, he looks ferociously explosive."
lakers,3cveu5,JeremyDolphin,2,Sat Jul 11 02:42:56 2015 UTC,"Randle's quickness, strength and ball handling looked great he was just a bit sloppy at finishing at times"
lakers,3cveu5,yatrickmith,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:50:20 2015 UTC,"Julius Randle is practically a rookie. I was hoping he could have better stats than KAT. As much as he played rusty, I think they forced the ball to him because he's not going to play tomorrow. And limited minutes on Sunday."
lakers,3cveu5,Scabandiri,5,Sat Jul 11 02:58:53 2015 UTC,"Russell set off to create for others and did a great job. He looked nice albeit a little out of shape.   Clarkson looked seriously impressive. You can tell he's put in work.  Randle was ok in terms of the game but showed flashes of brilliant speed and agility which was all I wanted to see. His injury is a thing of the past.   Upshaw exhibited rage, determination, and a  brief sequence of defensive dominance against the #1 pick. He is very out of shape but I'm in love.  Nance Jr. looked smooth.  I think he's another steal."
lakers,3cveu5,blackhillsgold,4,Sat Jul 11 02:54:13 2015 UTC,"My Thoughts:   Jordan Clarkson: By far, the best player on our Summer League squad. On both ends of the floor, he sweats athleticism. From rebounding, contesting shots, to reading the floor for putbacks, he's there. In addition to that, his stroke looks really nice. I'm sure all of us can tell that JC has definitely put in some work.   D'Angelo Russell: This guy can ball. His first shot, besides free-throws, was a 3 PT shot with nothing but net. His court vision though, is the most impressive. Seeing Russell running up the floor, hitting teammates with no-look passes, or just perfectly-timed ones is definitely gonna be a beauty to watch this season. I would like to see a little more hustle though on the defensive boards from him though. There were times when he'd just stand there, though same with Towns too.   Robert Upshaw: IMO, he started a little slow, and didn't get a lot of playing time. However, he is quite a presence on the defensive end of the floor. We all saw that monster block on KAT. Plus, his first shot was a turn-around And-1, and he knocked down the free throw. Something I remember from listening to him talk on that Seattle Radio interview on this subreddit, was that he really wanted to improve on his shooting, which I believe he really did work on.   Tarik Black: This guy is pure hustle and strength. Whatever we got him for, or however we got this guy, can't really remember how, but HE IS A MONSTER. Did you guys see his poster on KAT? He is a great hustle guy, with strength to put shots up on the inside, and thus, a great rotational player to combo with Randle and give each other rest.   Larry Nance Jr.: I was impressed by him. He definitely has athleticism, it cannot be overlooked. He gets rebounds, puts back shots explosively, and is a solid defender due to his size, athleticism and strength.   Julius Randle: To be honest, I came into this game with a lot of hype and expectation for Randle, and I left a little un-impressed, but again, this is SUMMER LEAGUE and the FIRST game of it too. I am very excited for him though. His energy is relentless. His strength is and was often times overpowering, and his speed for his size and position is literally out-of-this-world. Finishing the shots inside though, I hope, will come over time, which Reggie Miller noted as well. Lastly though, Randle's shooting still needs some work. It actually really does. And something else on Randle's strength, he defintely has been hitting the weight room. His arms look huge."
lakers,3cveu5,makesterriblejokes,8,Sat Jul 11 04:24:47 2015 UTC,"Randle needs to pass the ball and not ISO drive every time he catches the ball within 25 feet. I mean EVERY drive. Also he needs to box out, hustle, be alert on D and not play lazy D. His drives looked great and I'm not worried about his injury and he will finish better but I was disappointed in his lack of hustle and extreme tunnel vision. It stopped the flow of the game.  Russell is so fun to watch. He is an amazing passer, great handles, great pace, deadly in transition and was so fun to see every time he had the ball. He makes the right play and was impressive on D as well.  Clarkson best player on the court. Man amongst boys. He's special and can legitly be an all star soon. He felt very comfortable with Russ and will play great off ball and sg.  Upshaw got talent and can be a HUGE rim protector. Just gotta condition  Black- really good game. Rebounding beast and covered up a lot of randles missed box outs and lack of D. Impressed."
lakers,3cveu5,LakeshowAA24,4,Sat Jul 11 02:43:47 2015 UTC,"Randle looked tired there at the end, couldn't get his hands up on D."
lakers,3cveu5,rebeltrillionaire,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:51:05 2015 UTC,Black could potentially be our Tristan Thompson. I'd be pretty happy with that.
lakers,3cveu5,rebeltrillionaire,9,Sat Jul 11 08:07:51 2015 UTC,"the rotations were awful. deangelo didn't get enough minutes both overall and with the rest of the starters. don't get why he played so many minutes alongside the scrubs instead of with clarkson and randle. also randle looked bad. he has tunnel vision, can't shot, doesn't play defense and never passes. clarkson was great and the team should operate around clarkson being the better prospect then randle. deangelo played well but he was too passive and that buckys guy kept keeping the ball away from him. hate the lakers princeton offense. get with the times and go run a modern pace and space offense with a lot of pick and rolls."
lakers,3cveu5,lemp44,3,Sat Jul 11 02:43:05 2015 UTC,"This is why we could never have drafted Okafor. Bigs take years to develop. Randle won't be Charles Barkley in his ""rookie"" season. Guards are much more ready right away. Look at Ricky Rubio and Marc Gasol. Rubio was a pro at 16, Gasol was a whale.   Now? Rubio might not be a top 25 PG and Marc is a top 3 Center."
lakers,3cveu5,Titanosaurus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:03:55 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter though. He's still so far from his prime. He's 19 and I've already seen Laker fans shitting on him after his first game. The same way they're shitting on Randle in this thread. ""NBA Ready"" can mean just not d-league, or it can mean 15 ppg on a 15 win team. Rarely does it mean 25 and 10."
lakers,3cveu5,virji24,6,Sat Jul 11 17:56:45 2015 UTC,"About what I expected really, except the loss."
lakers,3cveu5,Titanosaurus,7,Sat Jul 11 20:18:31 2015 UTC,"Everyone needs to temper their expectations on Julius Randle. He's practically a rookie, having not played competetive in a year. He shouldn't be compared to other sophomores like Tarik Black, Jordan Clarkson or Lavine. He should be compared to Upshaw and KAT. My assessment on him, he has sick handles, but I think he's forcing it too much. Also I'm thinking that he was playing as much as he could because he won't play tomorrow, and likely won't play as many minutes as he did today. JC and D'loading needs to calm him down.  As for the others.  Tarik Black! DAYUM! I knew this guy would be a dark horse! I hope we can keep him long term! Kick Sacre and pay Black!  JC: Dear Mitch, PAY THIS MAN THE MAX!  D'angelo: Like what I see!"
lakers,3cveu5,supremesamurai,2,Sat Jul 11 02:36:35 2015 UTC,I've gotta agree with most of this. Plus Randle only played 20 min and still put up 11 points and showed he could get to the ft line as well
lakers,3cveu5,sharkytowers76,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:03:07 2015 UTC,Only 20 minutes. I'm getting all tingly thinking about his development.
lakers,3cveu5,makesterriblejokes,3,Sat Jul 11 04:37:16 2015 UTC,"Larry Nance surprised me the most. He was all over, and has some boost to his hops. Although Upshaw proved what we all saw from his highlights and I really hope we get him a contract on the squad."
lakers,3cveu5,ashishvp,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:42:33 2015 UTC,Some people jump high and some people jump quick.  Nance is that rare cat that jumps high and quick.  Very good pickup.
lakers,3cveu5,Barian_Fostate,3,Sat Jul 11 02:48:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's just like his dad. I think he's going to be super solid role player for us."
lakers,3cveu5,avengedteddy,11,Sat Jul 11 04:56:58 2015 UTC,Ughh..this team has a lot of work to do
lakers,3cveu5,virji24,5,Sat Jul 11 08:09:05 2015 UTC,I fucking love all this youth and I'm glad we aren't trying to stuff them on the bench behind expensive free agents.
lakers,3cveu5,avengedteddy,5,Sat Jul 11 02:35:12 2015 UTC,"first of all, refs were ruining the game   coach maddog needs to teach these guys on how to box out randle needs more offensive moves. the offense freezes when the ball is in his hands. he is very predictable and can't finish near the rim clarkson is faster and stronger but needs to be better at creating plays for others. he was playing like a 2 today, not a combo guard. russell is not aggressive enough and had lazy turnovers, as expected, but he controlled the pace well. his shot was off, probably due to conditioning upshaw did what we expected. he blocked shots but needs to develop better post defense, esp his defensive stance. upshaw is a little slow when shifting black was very good. he was the biggest surprise imo. nance/brown- both were mediocre. brown was completely off today from 3 and I expected a lot more from nance. Nance was hustling at first but either got tired or that injury was nagging him."
lakers,3cveu5,mphatso,4,Sat Jul 11 02:34:01 2015 UTC,The Randle can't finish at the rim is bs to me. The guy literally just started playing 5 on 5 a few weeks ago. Some people's expectations of him are ridiculous. Did I think he would play better? Yes. Am I surprised he was rusty? Not at all. Let's see how the kid is doing come the end of the preseason before we say he can't finish at the rim
lakers,3cveu5,SedaleThreatt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:43:42 2015 UTC,"fair enough. im not calling him a bust. he needs to finish at the rim because most are layups. Still, he also needs to learn more moves. he has a ridiculous first step for sure but its getting too predictable."
lakers,3cveu5,billyjoefrank,2,Sat Jul 11 04:29:02 2015 UTC,Lol why is everyone sounding so panicked? It's preseasons preseason! These guys will be looking great after a few games.
lakers,3cveu5,TheImmenseFence,2,Sat Jul 11 16:47:06 2015 UTC,"Clarkson looked very good. Too good to be on Summer League actually. He was a step faster than everyone else on the court. Lavine matched him in spectacular finishes, but Clarkson just looked more explosive than anyone else. That catch-crossover on Lavine-dunk and the split the double team-create an impossible and one were amazing. And that defensive sequence where he reached on the point guard, got him off balance, got off balance, then somehow managed to get right back into position at the 3-pt line was his best moment of the game. He's our most athletic player by far.  Russell played well. He made a lot of mistakes in the early first half, but he had a stretch in the third where he took over. His game doesn't translate well to the SL, because he's not surrounded by guys who can capitalize on his passing. Still he looked good.  Randle had a bad game. He sort of rebounded at the end, but he looked bad for much of his time. His outside shooting and free throws were very flat, and looked like frozen ropes. On the bright side, he looked explosive and had a few moves towards the basket that left defenders in his dust. That first step coupled with his strength is a good combination.   Upshaw played well. He was sloppy on the offensive end but showed a couple flashes. His defense on Towns and in help-position was very good. I'm excited to see him in the middle protecting the pain the next season."
lakers,3cveu5,ChodellBeckhamJr,2,Sat Jul 11 03:19:22 2015 UTC,I think people are down on randle too much considering he just recently started playing 5v5 again. He was able to get to the rim easily but his shot was off and his defense was not where it needs to be. Russle looked a little timid at times and defered to clarkson too much (who is too good for summer league).   Upshaw is a huge surprise and will only get better as he gets in shape. I loved his aggression and natural shot blocking ability. He had not fear going up against one of the best 1st round big men picks in a long time.
lakers,3cveu5,pbreal01,2,Sat Jul 11 06:14:13 2015 UTC,"poor randle, he wasn't that terrible guys"

lakers,3cveu5,Trebolations,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:43:01 2015 UTC,"Randle showed flashes of being special, he clearly could use a few games under his belt but what concerned me was his effort. While everyone else was diving for balls and going all-out on D he was looking a little too cool for me."
lakers,3cveu5,GeorgeLovesBOSCO,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:45:55 2015 UTC,So hyped to watch these rookies grow very impressed by clarkson. and russell's vision is scary
lakers,3cveu5,ceyenoq,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:46:16 2015 UTC,"Randle didn't look too great, wasn't finishing what I thought was easy buckets. I think it's fair to say Payne locked him down.  LNJ hustled a lot but didn't really have the minutes/opportunities to make his mark.  Buycks, while he did quite well on defence, bricked every shot iirc.  Brown didn't really stand out, but I think he was solid.  Clarkson beasted it, but that's to be expected.  Black did rather well imo. Hustled quite a bit but made some silly fouls.  Speaking of silly fouls, Upshaw's shoulder charge into KAT was unnecessary. However, he improved as the game went on. That (behind the back?) block on KAT was amazing and I'm really looking forward to seeing more of that.   Russell was solid. Made some great passes (6 assists) and very good steals. Shooting could be better though.  All in all, it was a solid performance. The majority of the team is rookies compared to Minnesota who, I think, had more sophomores in their lineup. Defence could be improved on. There were some cases where they failed to box out which resulted in giving away easy OR's to Minny.   That being said, I really look forward to the Philly game."
lakers,3cveu5,arkansastraffic,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:46:30 2015 UTC,"Clarkson looks like he's improved. Russell showed he could find guys on the court before they've found themselves; like he could vision the play beforehand. Randle looked rusty, but it was kinda expected after being out for so long. Upshaw was really fun to watch, since he was keeping up with KAT on both ends of the court and getting a few blocks."

lakers,3cveu5,_TheEndGame,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:29:16 2015 UTC,d'angelo russell did so good.
lakers,3cveu5,Gardeon,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:55:11 2015 UTC,"The young core played well.   -Nance, Jr. seemed to be everywhere on defense. Don't know what he'll become or his role on this upcoming season either.   -Anthony Brown has a pretty sweet jump shot. 1-4 from deep, but small sample size. solid 3-D role player in the making in the next few years.   -Jordan Clarkson playing like Westbrook out there. I love it. Only if he threw down that pass from Russell, that would've been sick. He's already a legit player, we know what he's capable of. Perhaps he is going to take the next step this year?   -D'Angelo Russell is legit. Court vision and passing skills is on an elite level. 6:5 assist to turnover ratio. he'll get better over time in both making more assists and limiting turnovers. He also had that sweet three-pointer as well.   -Robert Upshaw needs to get locked up to a real contract right now. Because a summer league contract means you're an unrestricted free agent.   -Tarik Black is Ben Wallace-lite. Both are athletic and muscularly built, but short for the position at 6'9"", defensive specialist and went undrafted. A point shy of a double-double today.   -Julius Randle needs to stop barreling (looking uncontrollably too) into people. He got an offensive foul on one play and missed another, just lowering his shoulder into his defenders chest. I get that he will try to beat his guy off the dribble, but I think Byron should put in a big-on-big pick-and-roll play with Randle being the ball handler. Griffin-Jordan and Josh Smith-Howard both used the big-on-big pick-and-roll to success. So why can't Randle do that?  -Mark Madsen, can you give my boy Will Davis II some minutes please?"

lakers,3cveu5,Titan67,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:02:13 2015 UTC,Let's not forget that Randle killed it in last year's summer league!
lakers,3cveu5,phantom_samurai,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:14:50 2015 UTC,clarkson playing like a man amongst boys
lakers,3cveu5,TheImmenseFence,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:51:39 2015 UTC,D'Angelo Russell is a stat sheet stuffer and I love it and Clarkson seems to be making a statement that last year wasn't flukey. But it is only ONE summer league game so far. Interested to see how the summer plays out.
lakers,3cveu5,ohsemantics,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:56:17 2015 UTC,JC is not afraid. He plays like he's the best player on the court. To me he is.
lakers,3cveu5,KingsCrossings,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:56:30 2015 UTC,per 36 upshaw had just under 9 blocks. god. dayum.
lakers,3cveu5,NicDwolfwood,1 point,Sat Jul 11 08:35:18 2015 UTC,"Clarkson was the best player on the floor and it wasn't particularly close.  Upshaw is already better than Sacre. Make it happen, Mitch! Towns was whatever, good passer but if that were a real game he'd be sitting for much of it. Too many fouls and not good ones. Tarik Black is a stud. He's the prototype of what you want your back-up big to be. Julius was by far the most disappointing player. He has one move and he expends too much energy going to the hoop; nothing comes easy for him. He needed a reliable J like yesterday, especially at his tweener size.  Loved the connection between Anthony Brown and DLoading. They seem to work well together. Russell is an excellent passer.   All in all, highly satisfying 10/10 would watch again."
lakers,3cveu5,NimbusIV,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:46:52 2015 UTC,This is gunna be one hell of a roller coaster year boys...im excited for the ride
lakers,3cveu5,FreshDiamond,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:22:49 2015 UTC,"They blew it at the end. but it was a very good game for 3 1/2 quarters  JC was a beast, Russell was decent. Randle was rusty, but you saw flashes of what he will be able to do. Upshaw vs Towns was fun to watch for a few minutes."
lakers,3cveu5,virji24,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:37:28 2015 UTC,"Upshaw is a good rim protector man but we have Bass and Roy Hibbert don't know if he actually makes the roster over someone else not sure who we could get someone whose not even playing for us. Also despite Randle not having a great game I don't think anyone could deny that, this man here has been working his ass off and not sitting on his ass while injured he looks like hes slimmed down a bit and added some muscle but still kept his speed or maybe im imagining things but despite results I like what I say from JR today D'Lo is Maguyver that boy makes something out of nothing...he sees shit that I couldn't see and i play point, and I'm watching the game from a damn wide view angle where i can see the whole floor lol.  All i gotta say is....things looking good already"
lakers,3cveu5,FreshDiamond,-1,Sat Jul 11 02:42:51 2015 UTC,"LOL KARL ANTHONY TOWNS is sooooooo good defensively. I'm not saying he won't be but Christ people acted like he was  Anthony Davis. 9 FOULS against a d league squad. Yikes, he looked decent though."
lakers,3cveu5,ashishvp,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:09:18 2015 UTC,Who you calling a d league squad bruh?
lakers,3cveu5,chaseeast,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:39:30 2015 UTC,Um the lakers d league team. If can't avoid fouls against NBA rookies and hopefuls how is he going to fair against seasoned NBA players
lakers,3cveu5,dieezus,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:45:07 2015 UTC,Wait you can't get fouled out in Summer League? KAT had NINE fouls?
lakers,3cveu5,tcorb95,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:18:02 2015 UTC,"yeah you can foul out, the max is 10 in the summer league"
lakers,3cveu5,ashishvp,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:47:18 2015 UTC,Tarik had 10  Upshaw had 6 in 12 minutes  russel had 6
lakers,3cveu5,royvarney,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:55:37 2015 UTC,10 fouls in summer league
lakers,3cveu5,readem_n_weep,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:08:42 2015 UTC,Jesus Christ that's a lot of fouls
lakers,3cveu5,arkansastraffic,0,Sat Jul 11 02:48:18 2015 UTC,"Clarkson, Lavine and Towns were all terrific in spurts. Really impressed by Lavine's outside shooting.   Russell's passing is among the best I've seen coming from a freshman to the pros, but his ability to create his own shot could be a cause for concern.  Upshaw happened to get a couple of blocks, but that's all he really does at this point. His positioning and stance on defense leaves a lot to be desired.  I know a lot of people on this sub are excited about Nance, but he really did not look like an NBA player in this game. Hopefully, he can show something, anything in upcoming games.  I love Brown's size and defensive capability, and even though his shots didn't go down tonight, his stroke looks very good."
lakers,3cveu5,arkansastraffic,2,Sat Jul 11 02:50:08 2015 UTC,Upshaw hasn't played much since college (he said about 8 games). He was tossed out early in the season last year.  Randle and Upshaw have rust.
lakers,3cveu5,SwaggyB23,0,Sat Jul 11 02:45:10 2015 UTC,I'm gonna get some flack for this but I didn't realize how slow Russell was haha
lakers,3cveu5,Yellowyuuki,2,Sat Jul 11 03:06:45 2015 UTC,he plays like curry slow.
lakers,3cveu5,virji24,3,Sat Jul 11 02:50:15 2015 UTC,"Absolutely nothing wrong with that, too. Him and Clarkson compliment each other really, really well."
lakers,3cveu5,Yellowyuuki,0,Sat Jul 11 02:56:25 2015 UTC,"Nothing about Russell yet? I thought he was gonna do a little better but then again KAT wasn't all great either. I hope he gets more of a rhythm going. Anthony Brown really surprised me and Nance also needs a rhythm going, but overall I wasn't too pleased but it's just the first game so far."
lakers,3cveu5,virji24,0,Sat Jul 11 02:59:41 2015 UTC,"Upshaw is awesome, Nance was trying to jump out the building so many times and I believe Russell can do better than this."
lakers,3cveu5,likwidsage,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:51:58 2015 UTC,Can definitely do better but he still put up 8 pts 5 rebounds(More than Towns) and a game leading 6 assists to go with 3 steals in only 26 minutes. If you're not happy with those numbers in his first game then you've got some high expectations of the kid
lakers,3cveu5,hypercoolemia,-3,Sat Jul 11 03:54:34 2015 UTC,Don't think I claimed I was unhappy but that I believe he can do better. No need to be putting words in my mouth.
lakers,3cveu5,virji24,3,Sat Jul 11 04:44:04 2015 UTC,I just meant in general. Calm down
lakers,3cveu5,Kilojoules,-2,Sat Jul 11 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"Randle started bad, ended strong.   Clarkson looks like he should be top 10 active real soon.  Russell looks like great as a rookie.   Upshaw has some real promise.   KAT had 9 fouls..."
lakers,3cveu5,goat_justinanderson,-1,Sat Jul 11 06:04:13 2015 UTC,"Felt like Russell played a little subpar with his shooting and poor assist to turnover ratio. Also looking at his movements down the court, he just seems slow. However it's just one summer league game, you don't need to be the most athletic to be the best, I'm sure he will develop.  JC played amazing. He's very athletic.. reminds me of a young poor man's Russell Westbrook.   Upshaw's D on Towns was pretty good, excited to see him play some more and show his hustle on D more consistently, and hopefully he can prove that he is worth that spot on our roster."
lakers,3cveu5,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Sat Jul 11 02:42:22 2015 UTC,Nah son. When it's all said and done Westbrook is gonna be a poor mans JC
lakers,3cveu5,goat_justinanderson,0,Sat Jul 11 02:44:55 2015 UTC,"While I understand Randle is rusty, I'm afraid that his game won't translate well as an NBA PF which is why he is getting work at SF.  He relies on his quickness in his face up game to get the cup but if he meets resistance, he has to put up a tough shot.  Nothing seemed easy unless if he got that first step on dudes.  His middling length looks like its hurting him when it comes to finishing around the basket since he has to double clutch a lot vs just putting shots over guys.  Also... I hate his body language on the court."
lakers,3cveu5,goat_justinanderson,-15,Sat Jul 11 04:45:58 2015 UTC,"D'Angelo Russell is GOAT  I mean considering his elite debut tonight why not right?  Below 50% percent shooting  1-3 from three  5 turnovers  7 fouls  The worst +/- on his team with -11  A nice airball with good form  Single digit points  All while single handedly leading his team to a loss I don't know about you guys, but I think he's got a chance to be special. I mean I know it's just summer league and I don't want to overreact, but there's a chance he becomes the GOAT point guard Your thoughts? ;)"
lakers,3cveu5,LA562,2,Sat Jul 11 04:56:53 2015 UTC,"you remind me of this obnoxious mavs fan i spoke to today who knows nothing about basketball.  can't wait for d'lo to tear your team's pathetic defense apart, wouldn't be surprised if even a rookie does it"
lakers,3cveu5,goat_justinanderson,-1,Sat Jul 11 02:57:06 2015 UTC,"First of all, I'm not a mavs fan  Second of all, he couldn't even tear up the Timberwolves summer league squad! LOL denial is an important part of grieving. It's ok I understand it will be a slow process to realize he is garbage"
lakers,3cveu5,LA562,-11,Sat Jul 11 06:19:51 2015 UTC,DANGELO RUSSELL IS A BUM
lakers,3cveu5,goat_justinanderson,5,Sat Jul 11 15:17:46 2015 UTC,"Lol wtf did Russell ever do to you, I just seen your comment history and all you do is talk about him, get off his dick.."
lakers,3cveu5,arkansastraffic,-2,Sat Jul 11 03:08:02 2015 UTC,I'm a time traveler here to tell you that he is going to be the biggest bust of 2015. Listen if you want to but if you don't that's not my problem
lakers,3cveu5,goat_justinanderson,2,Sat Jul 11 03:20:59 2015 UTC,You can say whatever you want I don't care but jeez it's like he fucked your sister and your real salty about it.
lakers,3cvcs3,Twinpair,19,Sat Jul 11 02:12:50 2015 UTC,A couple of fans stood up and were chanting Upshaw's name during the game lol. Anyone else catch that? People are really rooting for this guy to succeed and so am I.
lakers,3cvcs3,mister_greyMATTER,6,Sat Jul 11 02:41:42 2015 UTC,Yeah..I was there..the crowd was roaring for like 20 seconds after that block..You could tell that it pumped Upshaw up.
lakers,3cvcs3,diondrems,15,Sat Jul 11 14:28:20 2015 UTC,"Upshaw was getting real aggressive. Some may say ""it's only Summer League"" but it's good to see."
lakers,3cvcs3,TimeisIllmatic95,13,Sat Jul 11 02:45:15 2015 UTC,Sign Upshaw.  Let Upshaw develop in D-League for half a year. Upshaw promoted to Lake Show. Upshaw obtains rare candy evolves to UpShaq.

lakers,3cv4m9,ix_xvi_mdcccx,3,Sat Jul 11 02:04:10 2015 UTC,I would concur. Tremendous roll-man and a solid rim protector. Would have loved to see him run the high PnR with Russell.
lakers,3cv4m9,furple,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:11:23 2015 UTC,"What PnR?  Byron said the PnR was too predictable, remember?"
lakers,3cv4m9,dashan987,3,Sat Jul 11 01:43:39 2015 UTC,"I really don't think Ed is going to be much of a loss. Hibbert, I believe will have a much better yr with a change of scenery, Bass is one of the most reliable vet big men in the NBA, and Black/Upshaw are showing tons of potential right now in Summer League."
lakers,3cv4m9,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Sat Jul 11 02:32:16 2015 UTC,"If Upshaw shows consistent performances like what he showed in that T Wolves games, he might be the steal of the off season. Dude straight balled out."
lakers,3cv4m9,TheJucheisLoose,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:13:54 2015 UTC,Heck yeah! Very pleased w/ his performance against the T-Wolves. Let's see what he does against Okafor. I think he can shut him down too.

lakers,3cv4m9,TuneHD,2,Sat Jul 11 03:26:24 2015 UTC,"Ed gets no credit, sigh. That guy was the engine of the team last year."
lakers,3cv4m9,KidJush,2,Sat Jul 11 07:32:28 2015 UTC,Check some of Ed Davis' advanced stats with us last year.  http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2015.html  1st in ORtg with 124 (team was 103)  1st in DRtg with 107 (team was 110)  1st in PER (20)  2nd in TS% (59.4%)  1st in both offensive and defensive win shares (6.3WS)  1st in WS/48 as well  3rd in Offensive box plus/minus  1st in Defensive and total box plus/minus  1st in VORP  Man people don't understand how much this guy helps a team. Really wish we kept him.
lakers,3cv4m9,imadogg,2,Sat Jul 11 04:10:06 2015 UTC,"He was great on a terrible team. Doesn't mean he'll be able to beast on a very good team. Hopefully the opportunity he got this year continues elevating him though. The Blazers actually have some talent, and he seems really motivated. I think in a year or two he could be an X factor guy on a championship team. We have too many guys we wanna give minutes to develop and his ceiling isn't an All-Star.  Doesn't mean I won't miss ya Ed."
lakers,3cv4m9,rebeltrillionaire,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:24:31 2015 UTC,"He was great on a team in which pretty much everyone was a negative... his advanced stats are absurd for a roleplayer on such a shitty team.  His advanced stats and per36 have been good on every team, and he's always looked good when getting PT. I was super hyped when we signed him because I know he helps every team he's on.  :("
lakers,3cv4m9,imadogg,2,Sat Jul 11 09:09:00 2015 UTC,"Not arguing hard. I liked Ed more than anyone but Clarkson. I guess it came down to him being antsy to sign and us wanting another day to get Aldridge. I think Ed is our latest Ariza. He'll be successful, but he'll miss out on some good stuff here too."
lakers,3cv4m9,rebeltrillionaire,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:09:16 2015 UTC,We tried to keep him. He decided to walk. What can you do?

lakers,3cv4m9,Tymathee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:00:32 2015 UTC,"Aside from this and accusing Randle of having gotten fat their other mind numbing assessment was that Ryan kelly would be our starting small forward. Never mind that after the season Mitch admitted we forced kelly out of position, tried to experiment, and found he is a pf and def not a sf."
lakers,3cv4m9,Bballreasons,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I agree. But at the same time, I feel like we'll start Randle and hibbert and have bass and upshaw come off the bench. And if I'm being completely honest, I rather give upshaw his chance and let him develop. But I will miss ed's e energy and would be nice to have a little depth that didn't end with scare and black. But I heard we didn't just let him walk. We tried and failed. Besides, we only have little to spend that I would like to see go toward a seasoned point guard or another solid wing player who can shoot."

lakers,3cw0me,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:47:57 2015 UTC,I think Bass will definitely serve as a teacher/mentor for the young guys on this team.
lakers,3cw0me,krillinit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:15:23 2015 UTC,"He just had a bad game cause he hasn't played basketball for awhile. It's mainly about getting his muscle memory and timing back plus it's his first game back. I don't think he'll be starting, but he's received too much criticism."
lakers,3cw0me,Titanosaurus,5,Sat Jul 11 12:01:05 2015 UTC,Starting: PG - D'angelo Russel SG - Jordan Clarkson (plays PG with 2nd Unit) SF - Kobe PF - Brandon Bass / Julius Randle C - Roy Hibbert    Bench Lou Williams (6th Man) Nick Young (for Kobe) Julius Randle / Brandon Bass Tarik Black (2nd Unit Center) Robert Upshaw (Nice project) Anthony Brown (When Nick Young is being stupid)    The Rest:  Jabari Brown Anthony Brown Larry Nance Jr. Ryan Kelly Robert Sacre
lakers,3cw0me,oOoleveloOo,2,Sat Jul 11 14:55:02 2015 UTC,Can the Lakers play a 3-guard lineup with Russell-Clarkson-Kobe starting?
lakers,3cw0me,ravorg,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:27:53 2015 UTC,Definitely. I think there was a post that Byron Scott said he was gonna at least try it out.
lakers,3cw0me,ILikeChocolateMilkk,2,Sat Jul 11 17:44:55 2015 UTC,I can't complain lol pretty good young solid team
lakers,3cw0me,KidJush,2,Sat Jul 11 18:56:23 2015 UTC,"No lie that doesn't look half bad. Thought we were going for Tank II, but looking at this roster the Lakeshow might actually be competitive this year. Rebuild looking very well done."
lakers,3cw0me,Titanosaurus,3,Sat Jul 11 13:16:49 2015 UTC,Last year was Tank 2. Julius Randle breaking his leg was a huge blessing in disguise.
lakers,3cw0me,mrrymico,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:13:47 2015 UTC,"I dont think rookie Randle wins us too many more games last season, so I don't think blessing in disguise is apt. He couldve gotten valuable development that he could put to use this season"
lakers,3cw0me,Titanosaurus,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:17:35 2015 UTC,"The way the lottery is, we wouldn't have had the #2. Although, maybe having less balls would have gotten us the #1. Also, JC was developed. So we gave that."
lakers,3cw0me,angelino150,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:27:53 2015 UTC,"So our roster is as follows:  PG. Russell, Williams  SG. Clarkson, J Brown  SF. Bryant, A Brown, Young  PF. Bass, Randle, Kelly, Nance Jr  C. Hibbert, Black, Upshaw, Sacré"
lakers,3cw0me,Musingmike,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:02:25 2015 UTC,"Yup. Good news is this at least sets the team up for a future with many players who will be around for awhile to develop. However, bad news is this team doesn't have a realistic shot at the playoffs next season. Next season is just about becoming better and prepping for a big FA addition in summer '16 and getting ready for a real playoff run in '17."

lakers,3cw0me,jaysteezy24,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:22:15 2015 UTC,Starting to look good hopefully a Sacre and Kelly trade to free up space in the front court and pick up a veteran defensive wing in the event that Nick can't contribute on the defensive end and a 3rd string veteran point guard to play only if there are injuries.

lakers,3cvyjz,TweetPoster,7,Sat Jul 11 05:56:37 2015 UTC,"Those blocks put some $$ in his pocket. Glad to see we picked him up though, before any other teams hold him hostage for a contract."

lakers,3cvyjz,airfreshjoe,7,Sat Jul 11 07:19:15 2015 UTC,"Not fully guaranteed.  But seriously, it means that whatever the number is, only part of it is guaranteed and if we waive him, we only pay that part and only that guaranteed part counts against the cap."
lakers,3cvyjz,ReallyGoodUsername,5,Sat Jul 11 08:04:57 2015 UTC,"Fucking Mitch man, the guy is a certified genius  He downplayed Upshaw on the Radio. but after his good performance in limited minutes. he snatched him up immediately"
lakers,3cvyjz,NicDwolfwood,6,Sat Jul 11 08:30:57 2015 UTC,What exactly was genius about that? No one was going to sign him between that radio interview and the game. He could've called him Wilt reincarnate and it wouldn't have made a difference. There was really no reason to downplay his ability if he was going to turn around and sign him to a multi year deal as soon as he did anything.
lakers,3cvyjz,JustaGangsta,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:49:39 2015 UTC,I was talking about this with a friend the other day as a joke mostly but maybe he was testing Upshaw with that interview.
lakers,3cvyjz,sippinonsip,0,Sat Jul 11 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"I feel like he would have already had several direct conversations with him. And chances are a player in Upshaw's position isn't spending all his free time keeping up on sports radio.   If he wanted to test him, doing so passive-aggressively through the media doesn't seem like the way to do it.   I suspect more likely he was being sincere in the interview. Then Upshaw proved he can play (not really in doubt, but against KAT, that's going to draw attention), so they gave him a mostly non-guaranteed contract. Locks him up with little risk."
lakers,3cvyjz,JustaGangsta,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:00:27 2015 UTC,mitch was smart in trying to push black to play hard today
lakers,3cvuzt,Scabandiri,23,Sat Jul 11 05:13:50 2015 UTC,"He knows where he messed up, is willing to take responsibility and graded his performance extremely well and objectively. I think he is completely right that the pace and flow of the game kept bogging down because guys kept trying to do too much (Pretty certain he means Randle isos).   http://youtu.be/0fQVBN4QQWc      Here's randles post game interview. I wish he would have taken more responsibility for his defensive lapses and boxing out, but he is very confident and he did start to look a lot better as the game went on. I think he will be one of the most difficult players to stay in front off with his speed and strength and should be a beast but he needs to improve his bball iq, boxing out, hustling, and tunnel vision. He has the tools and talent and work ethic to be great, these are the easier things and I hope he learns quick"
lakers,3cvuzt,PatronSaintOfUpdog,9,Sat Jul 11 05:19:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think Randle just needs to play. And let the game come to him. I see him trying to force drives, and finishes in traffic, and I think he's so eager to be back out there he's not playing smart. He only does a few things well, but he's got all the tools to be a great player.. He's a year or two away I'd say; consistent minutes will do him wonders."
lakers,3cvuzt,sharkytowers76,4,Sat Jul 11 06:34:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I'm sure the crowd was begging for him to go human-highlight.  Not that its an excuse.  You're right he just needs to play.  There is so much potential for a guy that quick and that strong.  No mater what he needs to attend the school of Brandon Bass mid-range jumpers."
lakers,3cvuzt,TuneHD,2,Sat Jul 11 07:34:20 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%, really happy that he caught and noted every mistake and issue I had."

Clarkson looked great, this is going to be a special year for him.  And Randle will be fine once he settles down and starts playing within the offense.  Physically he looked strong and explosive so those were great signs.  Definitely not ready to play the three doe."

lakers,3cyg1s,spudwinkle,6,Sat Jul 11 23:46:46 2015 UTC,I'd rather have his face replace the upvote arrow on the left. Upshaws for good posts and comments!
lakers,3cyg1s,BuyAllTheVowels,3,Sun Jul 12 00:01:12 2015 UTC,This is a fantastic idea. You get one Upshaw.

lakers,3cyg1s,3500clout,0,Sat Jul 11 22:53:55 2015 UTC,Yes! 3 Upshaws means 3 times more blocks!
lakers,3cyg1s,aveydey,-1,Sat Jul 11 23:47:01 2015 UTC,Am I the only one slightly concerned by the fact that Upshaw looks 50? He has clearly had a rough upbringing.
lakers,3cyg1s,wanderfound,3,Sat Jul 11 23:18:12 2015 UTC,So you're worried because he looks old..?
lakers,3cyg1s,JimmyHasASmallDick,-2,Sat Jul 11 23:59:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, it can be a sign of early childhood development problems. Poor nutrition, drug use, etc."
lakers,3cyg1s,wanderfound,2,Sun Jul 12 00:07:15 2015 UTC,Or he just looks old.
lakers,3cyg1s,JimmyHasASmallDick,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:19:38 2015 UTC,"Have you ever seen Michael Finley? dude looked 50 out the gate.. no childhood problems, or drug issues.."

lakers,3cyg1s,aveydey,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:58:46 2015 UTC,I'd say his receding hairline is what really makes him look old. He's 21 and his face itself isn't exactly 50. I'd say at most he could pass as a 30 year old.

lakers,3cvcej,OoiDaBoi,14,Sat Jul 11 02:12:09 2015 UTC,Back to back blocks and a charge will do that.  We need Upshaw on our team.
lakers,3cvcej,aveydey,3,Sat Jul 11 02:28:01 2015 UTC,"I agree, those blocks had me so excited. He's obviously very raw, but the fucker can block!"
lakers,3cvcej,LifelongRedditor,3,Sat Jul 11 04:54:09 2015 UTC,When he elbowed towns .. Then blocked his punk ass haha towns stayed quiet after that.
lakers,3cvcej,FuriousFlex,11,Sat Jul 11 06:44:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say great, its been good for a guy who admits that he hasn't played ball in months But he still has some fundamental issues when guarding a guy 1 on 1 in the post. Hes allowing his opponent to get into position in the low post and allowing guys to back him in like that."
lakers,3cvcej,jaysteezy24,4,Sat Jul 11 02:15:23 2015 UTC,"Shot blocking was amazing, not sure I'd grade his defensive game as a whole too highly though. He looked slow and his post defense seemed sluggish. Would love to see some improvement in those aspects going into game 2, we all knew he could block shots all day already. There's no denying his energy though and his short stretch of good plays vs Towns lifted the team."
lakers,3cvcej,Rhyme_Pays,2,Sat Jul 11 04:38:49 2015 UTC,He is crazy out of shape though. No conditioning! It will get better
lakers,3cvcej,Belinder,2,Sat Jul 11 10:51:49 2015 UTC,Long Live The Paint God
lakers,3cvcej,videopower,2,Sat Jul 11 03:08:57 2015 UTC,"Low post defense still needs work, more on positioning and improved conditioning but that will come in time. He'll be a good project to work on.  Very happy with this signing, potential high reward."
lakers,3cvcej,AranciataExcess,3,Sat Jul 11 10:34:21 2015 UTC,I can't wait to see him go against Okafor. I think that will be a much better matchup for him. So much physicality.
lakers,3cvcej,mister_greyMATTER,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:32:12 2015 UTC,"We're watching a lot of extremely young players out there. His blocks were exciting, but he's got a long way to go before he's shutting down the paint against the real pros.  That being said, now is the perfect time for the Lakers to be signing young guys based on potential, and we got a good look at his potential last night. Very exciting. Good signing."
lakers,3cvcej,joerosion,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:12:50 2015 UTC,Dude had 3 blocks in 12 MINUTES. I was expecting him to be a bit rusty and not this good. Boy was I wrong

lakers,3cvcej,NicDwolfwood,-6,Sat Jul 11 02:14:25 2015 UTC,have you listened to  Mitch on Mason & Ireland? I am pretty sure he wont be on Lakers at the start of the season especially since we have only  roster spot left and 3 centers already.
lakers,3cvcej,rejectx,6,Sat Jul 11 02:16:09 2015 UTC,"anything can happen though, things change.   all i know is he's better than Sacre's bum ass"
lakers,3cvcej,NicDwolfwood,-2,Sat Jul 11 02:21:48 2015 UTC,"I think at the moment Sacre is more serviceable, Upshaw is super out of shape. I am hoping that we can make a spot for him, but now I don't think it's happening we need to trade some of these guys - Young/Kelly/Sacre then maybe. With last roster spot we either pick up PG or SF, not Upshaw."
lakers,3cvcej,rejectx,3,Sat Jul 11 02:23:57 2015 UTC,well I do hope some space clearing trades happen. Upshaw out of shape provides more than Sacre does.  If not then he'll be someone else's steal because the dude can play
lakers,3cvcej,NicDwolfwood,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:28:06 2015 UTC,Exactly we can't let Upshaw go.

lakers,3cvoid,aveydey,3,Sat Jul 11 13:24:00 2015 UTC,Realistically i think 3 is possible. Just on okafor. He could probably squeeze out another off another player but i think he's focused on dominating the other centers
lakers,3cvoid,teo1315,3,Sat Jul 11 07:46:35 2015 UTC,"i think he'll get more minutes now that he's officially made the squad, I'll go with 2 on okafor, 4 overall"
lakers,3cvoid,dissphemism,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:39:18 2015 UTC,The way the refs handed out fouls last game was excessive. Need to address that.
lakers,3cvihn,saskenasy,13,Sat Jul 11 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"I liked what I saw from Russell. Poised, in control, not trying to do too much. Always seemed to make the smart play. I look forward to him building his conditioning and his confidence. He should be scary once he gets going."
lakers,3cvihn,StuckFern,20,Sat Jul 11 04:51:06 2015 UTC,Randle looked lost. Expected though after a year off. Probably nervous and trying too hard in his game . but my gosh Clarkson looks legit. Like a legit starter.. Just one summer league game though.
lakers,3cvihn,mes8007,11,Sat Jul 11 03:55:54 2015 UTC,Understandably he looked nevrous for the first 3 qtrs. lotus flower was gone by the 4th and he started to be aggressive.
lakers,3cvihn,Bballreasons,4,Sat Jul 11 04:12:52 2015 UTC,"I agree, his nerves and lack of play over the last year may have gotten to him a bit, but his flashes of play like his strong first moves to the hoop and baseline dunk just prove he'll be alright, just a little rusty"
lakers,3cvihn,morelotion,4,Sat Jul 11 04:56:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in his post game interview he even said he felt like he needed to slow down. He was so excited/anxious to play after sitting for a year.   I hope he gets into his groove soon."
lakers,3cvihn,Nathaaan,2,Sat Jul 11 07:00:59 2015 UTC,"Randle just needs time to get his flow back - remember last year he started picking it up right before the season started! Guy hasn't played a proper game in nearly a year. He made a few good moves but just missed the shot, that will come with time"
lakers,3cvihn,dabolympian710,3,Sat Jul 11 09:03:33 2015 UTC,"Definitely thought Russell's passing was everything it was hyped up to be. He sure can thread the needle.  Also, Clarkson can get his jumper any time he wants to. Can't help but think Steve Nash every time he comes off those screens and shoots that leaner he has developed."
lakers,3cvihn,NimbusIV,4,Sat Jul 11 06:36:53 2015 UTC,"not only that but he was making passes that don't really look like they are there but in plain sight. Its hard to explain but like, dude would just take one dribble back and then deliver a pass to a wide open dude and it doesn't look like anyone is open. D'Lo has a real gift man his court vision is crazy"
lakers,3cvihn,dabolympian710,2,Sat Jul 11 08:40:30 2015 UTC,"yeah if he can do that at NBA regular season pace I'd be impressed. The game slows down for great players, so if the game goes slow for him that's an amazing sign.  I also like that he can get his own shot but chooses not to. All in all this game was a good sign."
lakers,3cvihn,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,5,Sat Jul 11 08:44:14 2015 UTC,"Russell and Clarkson were great together but Randle was sort of a black-hole. He'd look slow and lazy without the ball or would do some bad cuts, his screen game nice though. Once he started embracing the Pick and Roll game, then he finally started to get rolling (I crack myself up)"
lakers,3cvihn,BABYPUBESS,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:25:29 2015 UTC,"He seemed really lazy on the boards, there's no reason black should of had to grab all the rebounds down low. But he looked strong and quick, so the physical assists are there."
lakers,3cvihn,NeoWasAProgrammer,2,Sat Jul 11 12:33:19 2015 UTC,"More or less what I expected on the offensive end, but someone needs to teach Randle to use his size on defense/boxing out. However, the signings of Hibbert and Bass will help us tremendously. Russell looks as cool as ice out there, which is good for Randle, who seems to be out of control at times. Russell's vision is really impressive, like he has the position of all the players in his head at all times. I've really appreciated JC's work towards the end of last season, and I'm glad he's been working hard to get better."
lakers,3cvhh1,Doocane,9,Sat Jul 11 02:56:18 2015 UTC,Black A- or B+. 13 boards when Randle had 1 and was making up all of Randles deficiencies on D. Randle will finish better and make more of those shots and he set solid screens but his tunnel vision and lazy D and 0 boxing out (1 rebound wtf) is an issue. Our offense is beautiful when up tempo or pick and roll and transition but bogs down when running Princeton or whenever we had Randle isos
lakers,3cvhh1,Scabandiri,6,Sat Jul 11 03:31:56 2015 UTC,Did you not watch Buycks defense? my god.
lakers,3cvhh1,Buckelroo,3,Sat Jul 11 04:56:08 2015 UTC,"yea but I doubt he does this to Kyrie or whatever other primary ballhandler.  His D was vicious though, yeah."

lakers,3cvhh1,oOoleveloOo,7,Sat Jul 11 07:28:14 2015 UTC,Upshaw a C?
lakers,3cvhh1,javi2123,14,Sat Jul 11 03:02:07 2015 UTC,"Like I said, i think people are getting too caught up in his highlight blocks. Thats the only area he shined, and these are overall grades. Even defensively I was concerned every time someone spaced him from the rim. He moved pretty slow. Upshaw isnt good yet, he had only played ~8 games of basketball before we picked him up and after he got kicked off the team. Its gonna show in his games, and it did. I also grade him harder because I have high hopes for this kid."
lakers,3cvhh1,redundantPOINT,6,Sat Jul 11 03:11:43 2015 UTC,"He really reminds me of young Dee Gordon for the Dodgers.   Upshaw is young, unproven, and will be maddeningly inconsistent.   He was all over the place in a bad way today. Running mostly in straight lines and his timing and my or were off.   But like Gordon, he's got one elite skill that captivates an audience. Whenever Gordon got on base he was running and everyone knew. When Upshaw is in the paint, his presence alone is rim protection. A few guys testes him and got their shot blocked, and every timberwolves player was looking for him once they got into the lane.  His overall game was what you expect for a rookie, especially a one that isn't particularly skilled. But he gave everyone exactly what they wanted."
lakers,3cvhh1,Rhyme_Pays,2,Sat Jul 11 07:21:51 2015 UTC,perfectly said.
lakers,3cvhh1,FuriousFlex,2,Sat Jul 11 15:43:11 2015 UTC,"I agree, if it wasn't for a 1 min stretch on Towns I think people would have said he had a bad game. He looked fairly slow and his post defense looks like it could use work. I still have faith in him, but I don't think I saw what a lot of others were seeing today that made him seem like a beast. I loved what Black did however."
lakers,3cvhh1,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,-2,Sat Jul 11 04:33:50 2015 UTC,C for center doeee lol
lakers,3cvhh1,NimbusIV,3,Sat Jul 11 03:32:21 2015 UTC,"Randle was definitely a C-, he'd do 5 dumb moves for every awesome move. Also his D was sooooo bad. But everything aside, his first-step deserves an A++, I'm usually real/not hyperbolic, but his first step was so quick, someone so strong yet quick should be unfair. D+ for his finishes though, he'd do some blatantly illegal offensive pushes, once the refs caught on he had to rely on contorting his body slightly, yet enough to miss some easy layups, his body control needs a little work."
lakers,3cvhh1,chrisle991,2,Sat Jul 11 03:31:21 2015 UTC,"Alot of people really don't value on ball defense as much unless the commentators say something about it with that said Buycks had terrific on ball D and I think he could play like that vs anyone, but his shot selection(if you want to call it that dude just caught the ball and shot no matter what usually) really hurt his performance and took away from some of the great D the dude was playing."

lakers,3cvhh1,Donkeykongalan,0,Sat Jul 11 03:36:38 2015 UTC,Upshaw is definitely a B or even B+. Buycks was like a D-
lakers,3cvhh1,sharkytowers76,0,Sat Jul 11 03:26:23 2015 UTC,Everyone looked like crap so I'll go with what coach said and say everybody looked tired. Even Clarkson missed a couple alley oops. Least impressed with AB but he had good numbers. He's got to be more aggressive even though he ended up doing ok just playing it safe. Randle's got to get a higher grade for being our go to guy when you know he was more tired than most and still got us back to back points. Plus if miss school for being sick you get to take the test later so no need for a test score on him. He's got a game off and then the last game before the playoffs begin to get body going again. And we can kind of skip scores for all the players because these first 3 games won't count against us as far as the SL playoffs. Got to give Minny a good grade even though it looked like we got beat by a bunch of guys with years more experience. And I got to either give KAT a bad score or Upshaw a good score. Nobody even mentioned the Upshaw ISO where he scored over Towns from about 15 feet.

lakers,3cw33q,CHUN_BUNS,55,Sat Jul 11 07:00:36 2015 UTC,"CP3 veto is worse.  Losing DJ = a Shakespearean tragedy where you get stabbed in the back by your ""friend."" Et tu, DeAndre? An utter betrayal.  Losing CP3 = a Kafka-esque nightmare where you are crushed like a cockroach by the machine that created you.  A feeling of ultimate powerlessness."

lakers,3cw33q,Mantis-Toboggin,18,Sat Jul 11 07:00:52 2015 UTC,"CP3.  As frustrating as the DeAndre situation was, that's a risk teams run during the negotiating period. It had never been seen that a player of Jordan's caliber waivered in his commitment, but it happened. Basically, the Mavs failed to actually sign him, for whatever reason it might have ultimately been. The Clippers wound up doing what they needed to do to get Jordan back.  Dallas was definitely screwed over though.  Same thing happened to the Lakers, except that instead of a shitty-but-within-the-rules situation from a player, we got ""basketball reasons"" from the league itself. Given the fact that the league owned NO, there was a huge conflict of interest with the managing of the team. Other NBA owners were pissed that LA got Paul while still unloading a bunch of money, and still having assets to acquire Dwight, which we did. Despite granting permission to the acting GM to explore and make trades, and promising not to interfere, they did the exact opposite. The intervened and canceled the trade.  And not only that, they did it AFTER APPROVING the trade initially.   Much like the Mavs, the Lakers were screwed. Odom quit the team, and the ever-present trade rumors for Gasol materialized and then canceled. Very bad situation for both guys. Odom eventually wound up turning into Nash, but that didn't work. We didn't have enough talent and promise to keep Dwight either.  So in short, Jordan and the Clippers made a dick move, but within the rules. The NBA front office, on the other hand, just invented something to cancel the Paul trade, with no precedent, and likely no repeat scenario, when all participating team front offices were in agreement of the trade. The pen was never actually put on paper with the Jordan deal, but THREE teams actually signed off on the CP3 trade.  A more equivalent scenario would be you guys officially signing Jordan, but then an hour afterwards the signing is overruled by the commish because of ""basketball reasons,"" and then he signs with Houston or San Antonio.  Edit: and when we got some ""explanations"" as to the actual motives behind the veto, we learned the two main opponents were Dan Gilbert and Mark Cuban, both opposing the deal because the new collective bargaining agreement was designed to prevent larger market teams from prying away stars from smaller markets. This stung even more, because Paul was traded to the exact same city. The team was not as marketable as the Lakers, but Los Angeles sure was. However, they didn't complain (or not nearly as hard) when the then-struggling and re-building Clippers acquired him. It thus appeared that the other owners were pissed that Paul was traded to the Lakers in particular, and the league took their side, instead of being neutral, and hurt us. With the Jordan situation, at least the league remained impartial."

lakers,3cw33q,PantslessMan,4,Sat Jul 11 07:09:07 2015 UTC,Obviously CP3
lakers,3cw33q,TimeisIllmatic95,4,Sat Jul 11 07:03:08 2015 UTC,"Cp3 fiasco caused a butterfly effect,    Pau never quite played the same for us and booked town, awkward situation where you break up with a gf but she still lives with you ,  I love Pau he's one of my all time favorites. But there's no doubt that is how the situation felt for him. Lost Odom in that situation as well,  we broke his heart at his prime and we have all seem the downward spiral he has gone in since then.   Our little brother the clippers got stronger than us,  thats something no Laker fan ever wants to see.  We lost out on a franchise point guard and lived in turmoil for the past few years.  If we have cp3 Dwight coward probably stays.  With cp3 spreading the touches,  does Kobe overwork himself?  Does he ever get hurt?     You can imagine all sorts of what ifs and fantasies,  but the fact is that veto set us back in what could have been a glorious end of kobes career. Nothing will ever feel or  could be worse then that."
lakers,3cw33q,Joerge90,3,Sat Jul 11 15:06:09 2015 UTC,"Are you asking about the situations? Losing CP3 hurts a lot more than DeAndre.  But if you're saying, which would make me more upset... the same player getting basketball reason'd, or pulling a DJ?   I'd still pick basketball reasons. A player being immature is one thing; I get the whole buyer's remorse (which in a sense is what he felt, I bet) and I can understand why DJ would want to undo his decision. It really sucks but at least it's understandable. But basketball reasons was something else... it felt like the league (i.e. the other owners) were specifically trying to stop the Lakers from getting good. Like the Lakers being successful somehow was a bad outcome that should be stopped for its own sake. I always said... what would you, or any of the complaining owners, think if the league basketball reason'd the Clippers' trade first and instead the Lakers ended up with CP3?   That's when you realize how utterly pointless and unjustifiable ""basketball reasons"" was. DJ's idiocy at least comes from an understandable place."
lakers,3cw33q,justgivingsomeadvice,3,Sat Jul 11 07:19:47 2015 UTC,"CP3 Veto.  First off all, hes a much better player, second, the trade was done. The contract was literally signed but for ownership approval. It also only happened because your fuckshit of an owner and Dan Gilbert decided to throw a hissy fit to the media and David Stern to try and stop it, not for any good basketball reason as the Lakers trade offer was actually pretty good."

lakers,3cw33q,spacejungler,2,Sat Jul 11 07:38:28 2015 UTC,"The DJ situation definitely felt more disrespectful. He didn't treat the Mavs with even the minimum amount of dignity and respect that a decent human should have given them. So I can see how that might hurt more if you care about that kind of thing - saving face, getting dissed, people treating you with respect. With the CP3 veto, while the owners were definitely selfish punks, they weren't disrespectful to the degree of DJ.  That being said, CP3 was way worse for the team. The Lakers not only didn't get CP3, but they also lost Odom's heart. Gasol felt unwanted too, and who knows how much that played a part in him leaving later to the Bulls. The Lakers assets were damaged afterwards. With the DJ situation, no other Mavs players were damaged as players. Not only that, the CP3 trade was approved by the teams involved. It had to be overturned. DJ never signed a contract, and his verbal agreement was non-binding. To make them equivalent, DJ would have to sign the contract and then have it overturned by the league. And lastly, CP3 is a way better player, actually worthy of a max deal, than DJ. You can build a team around CP3 but not around DJ.  So if you care more about respect and saving face, I can see how DJ might feel worse. But if you care more about basketball and the state of your team, then the CP3 veto was definitely worse."
lakers,3cw33q,needmoresleeep,2,Sat Jul 11 13:26:56 2015 UTC,Can we not talk about the CP3 thing anymore? I'm sick and tired of waking up in a ditch and having to clean up from Scotch and Xanies.
lakers,3cw33q,readem_n_weep,4,Sat Jul 11 14:39:22 2015 UTC,"P.S. The reason I ask this is because this is the worst that I've felt in the off-season since becoming a mavs fan in 2004. I truly dislike and even hate what DJ did to us and feel disrespected as a fan. That said, my friend (who is a huge Laker fan) told me through text that I know now how he felt when the cp3 trade was blocked after it was already accepted. I replied and told him that this is much worst and we debated from there. So, my curious thought is, how do you guys feel about both scenarios if theoretically if both happened to the Lakers?"
lakers,3cw33q,mayonuki,5,Sat Jul 11 07:03:44 2015 UTC,"There are some differences.  First the timelines are different.  You had a few days under the impression plus that last day of ambiguity.  As I recall the chris paul thing happened relatively soon after the trade was announced.  And once it was announced it was final.  Jordan's thing feels a lot more personal to me.  He and the clippers made the situation a joke and that is pretty infuriating.  Donald Stern didn't really antagonize the lakers or make a show out of it with emojis.  He is one guy to direct hate towards, and he got a lot of hate for this and a lot of things, but it is different from seeing another team gain from your loss.  Now all of that said, it has been kind of a slow burn seeing the clippers come from basically being a joke all because of that bull shit.  Especially with the lakers struggling in the aftermath.  So I think what I am saying is that this initial week for you might be a little more infuriating, but I think the lakers lost more for worse reasons and that hurt more over time.    Regardless fuck that trash organization.  Side note, I was out of the country and didn't follow everything as closely back when the trade got blocked.  I didn't really have anyone to talk to and I wasn't spending the day refreshing reddit to check every update.  So my memory of that event and this one is a little different."

lakers,3cvla5,ricecuker,12,Sat Jul 11 03:33:10 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you said but the Princeton thing. What they ran for most of tonight didn't resemble the Princeton.  Not to compare him but Jordan and Kobe ran the Triangle which is similar to the Princeton. They were able to break out of the offense when needed.  DLo is just a kid. Tonight was crazy. He'll settle down. He just needs experience.  Yes. A lot of potential.
lakers,3cvla5,readem_n_weep,3,Sat Jul 11 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"I really liked what I saw. Needs to build his endurance and his confidence, but he played his role extremely well. Distributed the ball, made the smart play way more often than not. His court vision is crazy, especially that no-look alley oop to Clarkson. Once he starts asserting himself on offense he'll be scary."
lakers,3cvla5,StuckFern,2,Sat Jul 11 04:57:42 2015 UTC,Good first game. He just needs to find the balance between scoring/passing.
lakers,3cvla5,ElementShield,2,Sat Jul 11 03:36:55 2015 UTC,I am getting a Steve Nash vibe from him.
lakers,3cvla5,ByTheBeardOfBruce,2,Sat Jul 11 04:36:03 2015 UTC,"By the end of the first quarter I knew this offense was shit for him. I hope Byron changes it.   His passing is as good as advertised. Defense and athleticism about as advertised as well, but no one plays defense in summer league.   Randle looks like he needs to play. He's got all the potential, but I think he just needs to get out there, shake the rust off, find his groove and settle into the game. I don't know if it's just that he hasn't played in a long time or if it's just one game, but I think he tries to do too much. Once he settles in, I think he'll be as good as we hope.  Clarkson is as good as he finished the season. Maybe a little better, I love seeing him and Lavine go at it. Seems like they really enjoy going against each other.  We were beasts on glass, and man, Nance looks like he'll be a great rebounder. He's thick, athletic as hell, and hustles for them, which is great to see.   I'm glad we signed Upshaw, though I'm still not sold on him. I want to see him vs Okafor tomorrow.   All in all I'm happy. The Princeton offense pisses me off, but at the same time I hope Russell gets confident enough to just abandon it when he wants to. It would benefit everyone."
lakers,3cvla5,PatronSaintOfUpdog,2,Sat Jul 11 06:23:12 2015 UTC,Pick and Rolls and the Princeton offensive are not mutually exclusive. Everything else I more or less agree with
lakers,3cvla5,Buckelroo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:34:51 2015 UTC,"Agree'd I hate this offense for him, it doesn't suit the type of guards we have. Clarkson didn't succeed in the Princeton, he was allowed to run PnR all day to succeed. But back to Russell, his conditioning needs more work on, and he overplayed his guy a few time allowing Towns to deliver a give and go pass for an easy bucket. I think he wasn't too aggressive in terms of hijacking the offense, he looked like he was just playing within the Princeton. Shot were all short and I think Byron talked about it because of all the running the teams been doing these past few days so there isn't much to worry about."
lakers,3cvla5,jaysteezy24,-3,Sat Jul 11 03:38:51 2015 UTC,"He may be one of the least athletic PGs in the league.  Holy shit this guy can't move.  He's not anywhere near Harden level athleticism.   That being said, excellent passer, good feel for the game, long and should get a lot of steals, looks to be a decent shooter.  I don't ever expect him to be a superstar but it does look like he could start for a long time.  Time will tell."
lakers,3cvla5,JustAGuy993,3,Sat Jul 11 04:05:04 2015 UTC,you obviously missed the cuts he made to the basket and the sweet layup as well....

lakers,3cvla5,JustAGuy993,2,Sat Jul 11 04:40:55 2015 UTC,"Steph Curry, Chris Paul, Kyrie Irving, Steve Nash & Tony Parker also lack that athleticism. I don't think it's going to hinder his game whatsoever, especially considering his game is very similar to those guys above."
lakers,3cvla5,badguymatt,0,Sat Jul 11 05:41:24 2015 UTC,"Uh what?  Curry, Paul, Irivng and Nash have/had insane quickness, Paul especially.  Russell doesn't.

lakers,3ctdzr,denimourson,28,Fri Jul 10 16:55:34 2015 UTC,"Andrew Wiggins should win. And Zach Lavine shouldn't be on it over Noel and Mirotic, who were technically NBA rookies last season."
lakers,3ctdzr,BABYPUBESS,5,Fri Jul 10 17:02:38 2015 UTC,"Wiggins 2a. Clarkson  2b. Noel 3a. Payton  3b.  Lavine  4.Mirotic   Wiggins did something rookie's rarely do, STEADILY improve even at the end of the season.  Wiggins looked lightyears better than he did in college (fits the nba game way better) and you gotta give him credit where its due.  He put up a big performance against lebron and all in all was very consistent through the season.  He never really hit a wall and you could just tell that he dripped with superstar potential.  To weather the losses and ups and downs of playing in Minnesota isn't easy.  Living up to the hype of #1 isn't easy, especially after lebron shunned you.    Maybe it's a bit of homerism but I think Clarkson is #2 (barely).  He  single handedly made a name for himself this year.  He didn't simply chuck up shots.  I really get annoyed when people dismiss his year as ""he was on a shitty team."" For a guy who had limited 3pt range and wasn't known as a shooter he's developed a nice shot over the last year and like wiggins steadily improved and never really hit a wall.  Wiggins has the bigger sample size so he has to take it but Clarkson was putting up good peformances against really quality teams and pg's.  yeah he struggled when the clippers collapsed on him in the first game but he made adjustments and played a great game in his second one against chris paul.  He demonstrated a poise and willingness to learn that showed.  He went from rushing at one speed to using all speeds and directions to really blossom as a pg.  He can clearly handle playing PG.  Nick young, jordan hill, Jeremy lin and wesley johnson were all on a terrible team last year as well, and not a single one of them looked 1/2 as good as clarkson did.  W/o pau gasol or kobe around Nick young wilts as a player when he has to act as #1 option.  Clarkson was able to develop into the #1 option and for a rookie, did an amazing job.  It'll only get easier for him when he's the third option-fourth option.   Noel is a defensive stud. Few players ever average close to 2 steals and 2 blocks agame and he had stretches where that was added to regular double doubles.  Unlike the lakers though, the sixers did not lose with class.  I felt like as much as we struggled we put up good fights and competed every night.  Nerlens didn't show nearly the leadership Wiggins or Clarkson did so he barely slips to 3.   Payton gets the edge over lavine because he started nearly the whole season and while he has some gaps in his game still it's clear he will start in the nba.  Lavine drips with potential like wiggins but he simply didn't get tested enough to really deserve the edge.  He was in a crowded backcourt and he didn't show nearly the same consistency as nerlens, wiggins or clarkson.    I love mirotic but he was far too sparingly used (and he's the oldest of the bunch) to really deserve rookie of the year.  Of all the rooks he had a huge opportunity to shine with pau and all the bigs there banged up in the playoffs, and left a lot to be desired."
lakers,3ctdzr,Bballreasons,4,Fri Jul 10 21:18:21 2015 UTC,"Not sure why people are surprised about Lavine, he actually had pretty good numbers, although I'd take Noel over him. I'd probably take Wiggins over Clarkson, but Clarkson is a close second."
lakers,3ctdzr,TuneHD,8,Fri Jul 10 17:03:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely think Clarkson is second only to Wiggins. But I wonder what it would look like if Clarkson started the whole season and didn’t have to share minutes with kobe, lin, and Ronnie. I think last year, the most frustrating thing for a lakers fan was the rotation management of our guards."

The only time I can remember being genuinely mad at the Lakers as when Clarkson was about to get a triple double with plenty of time left in the 4th and Scott benched him. He had a huge game and they rewarded him with that, straight up disgusting."

lakers,3ctdzr,CalmerThanYouAreDood,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:44:09 2015 UTC,Elfrid is great but i think I’d take JC over Payton anyday still. JC just seems so in control hardly TO’s and has great efficiency across the board.
lakers,3ctdzr,harleq01,5,Fri Jul 10 21:23:57 2015 UTC,"Nerlens averaged 9.9 and 8.1, with almost 2 blocks AND 2 steals per game to add to that. LaVine average 10 pts, but didn't get many rebounds or assists and only averaged 0.7 spg. He also didn't shoot very well from the floor, 42% from the field and 34% from three."
lakers,3ctdzr,BABYPUBESS,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:35:22 2015 UTC,"he was also, by eye test and by stats, probably one of the 5-10 worst defenders in the league"
lakers,3ctdzr,justgivingsomeadvice,0,Fri Jul 10 21:11:52 2015 UTC,That's why I said I'd take Noel over him. Just there were comments on the article saying Lavine was bad or they had no idea how he was even considered. He had a pretty strong rookie season so it's not like they gave some random guy the spot.
lakers,3ctdzr,TuneHD,2,Fri Jul 10 20:01:30 2015 UTC,And its players. They go for flash.
lakers,3ctdzr,TuneHD,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:10:10 2015 UTC,He definitely wouldn't have been considered had he not won the dunk contest
lakers,3ctdzr,FreshDiamond,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:03:44 2015 UTC,Wiggins will win but the difference between him and Clarkson was opportunity. By the end of the season Clarkson was a better player. Clarkson got no minutes early on got thrown away to the d league came back to inconsistent minutes and then got thrust into a starting role where he was the centerpiece of the team post all star break. Wiggins was viewed as a franchise player in high school so of course he gets more opportunity but that was the difference between the two this year
lakers,3ctdzr,TheRealMelvinGibson,0,Fri Jul 10 19:44:35 2015 UTC,Ehh I don't know. Wiggins had streaks where he was really living up this hype. That's hard to do as a no. 1 overall.
lakers,3ctdzr,FreshDiamond,3,Fri Jul 10 20:53:06 2015 UTC,And Jordan is punished for having no hype. He got used sparingly and demoted. Then we he returned he did nothing but improve. He shot 44 percent from the field and made great strides in the way he sees the game as a pg. His per 36 numbers are better than wiggins. I know that doesn't always translate when the playing time is equal but jc having 30 something starts is a pretty large sample size. All I'm saying is if jc was picked 16th instead of 46th or whatever it was he would have got a lot more playing time early on he never would have been sent to the d league and no one would be doubting his ability now. Wiggins obviously had the better season but he was put in a far better position to succeed. Long term of course I think wiggins is the better prospect. He is 20 and just averaged 17 a game. I just think it was a lot harder road for jc and by the end of the season he was the better player.
lakers,3ctdzr,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:32:31 2015 UTC,"Yep. Well said. As long as we agree Wiggins is in fact the better prospect long term, fair enough."
lakers,3ctdzr,FreshDiamond,2,Fri Jul 10 21:43:14 2015 UTC,We definitely agree on that
lakers,3ctdzr,SilentScream21,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:49:31 2015 UTC,You're right in that it is sort of a self-fulfilling prophesy. We see it every season when a young player gets traded to another team as a throwaway and blows up once he's given the opportunity that high draft picks are granted.
lakers,3ctdzr,FreshDiamond,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:56:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah man I don't think people everyone that gets close to being can do something really well. What separates almost players from the players, is can you do more than thing can you do it consistently and can you make the most of your first opportunity because most fringe guys only get one shot. High draft picks obviously get several opportunities but late picks and undrafted guys pretty much get one shot."
lakers,3ctdzr,lolxddavid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"JC would give Wiggins a run at the money if he had the same opportunity he had at the end of the season. By the end, Clarkson was having a better FG% than Wiggins."
lakers,3ctdzr,virji24,5,Fri Jul 10 20:59:09 2015 UTC,The per 36 numbers favor JC as well.  If given the opportunity from the beginning he might have won rookie of the year.  I remember always watching at the end of the year and wondering when JC would drop back down to Earth.  I then realized that he had and that was the player he was.    We got very luck to get JC

lakers,3czddo,gotninjaskills,15,Sun Jul 12 04:03:00 2015 UTC,"First, understand that young point guards universally struggle at this stage. D'Angelo is no different.  Second, we didn't pick D'Angelo because he was more NBA ready than Okafor. We picked him because we believe he has a higher ceiling. Ceilings take awhile to reach, be patient."
lakers,3czddo,StuckFern,5,Sun Jul 12 04:22:17 2015 UTC,"It took Steve Nash 5 years to average 15 points and 7 assists. Tony Parker averaged 9 points and 4 assists his rookie year. John Wall has yet to crack 20 points per game. It took Gary Payton 5 years to average 16 points and 6 assists.   Guard development can take a little bit longer. Luckily D'Angelo has Kobe and Clarkson, who seems to be developing at an unbelievable rate.   I'm not putting our expectations too high for Russell this season. I trust in Mitch. Russell has the skills to be a superstar in this league for many years. He may not make the immediate impact that Jahlil Okafor's been hyped over, but seeing as we're not really in championship-or-bust-2016 mode that doesn't really matter. I think a lot of this season will be getting D'Angelo's game adjusted to the NBA, watching Clarkson shine, and watching Randle get recognized around the league as a bully on the court."

Yeah. The Kings.   I wouldn't worry about anything that happens in the SL other than an injury."

Either way it's absurd that I have this many down votes for telling the truth. Nick Young did not take less money to come here. He came here very late in the offseason for the vet minimum because no one wanted him. If Dwight Howard never leaves the lakers nick young is likely not in the nba. He maybe took a discount to stay here MAYBE. I never read any reports about teams really trying to get him though. Nick Young isn't as bad as he was last year but he isnt good. He had a good year under mine d'antoni because every guard ever has a good year under mike. At his best he is an inefficient chucker who sucks at everything but volume scoring.

lakers,3ctijy,darkshark21,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:39:18 2015 UTC,"He had a bad year last year but is basically the same player as 2 years ago.   His attitude didn't change even when he was injured /struggling which is probably why he gets all the hate.   However, I think he can still be an effective player. Either way, the Lakers need to keep him and play him because his value is so low at the moment."
lakers,3ctijy,redundantPOINT,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:28:27 2015 UTC,I guess when you sign 5 year deal before last season that would seal the deal.
lakers,3ctijy,Proteinsock,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:32:57 2015 UTC,"His trade value is basically zero right now, from what I've read, so basically we need him to either contribute and be someone we can eventually trade, or contribute and help the team get better."
lakers,3ctijy,metrofeed,0,Fri Jul 10 22:14:08 2015 UTC,Can we trade him to Denny's for a couple of Grand Slams?

lakers,3cucag,swaggerqueen16,5,Fri Jul 10 21:09:05 2015 UTC,I'd be very curious to see how much respect the players give Madsen as their summer league coach.  Do they take him seriously enough to actually do what he says?
lakers,3cucag,wanderfound,3,Fri Jul 10 21:14:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they do. Most are trying to make the roster after all.   I'll see how they react to what he says  Edit: yup, just as I expected"

Randle at times looked awful. He would just Sprint into the paint and collect offensive fouls or pass stupidly and get turnovers. Very inefficient

The level of discipline to stay as lean as he has while rehabilitating shows how committed he is to improving. His work ethic will take him far in this league."
lakers,3ct8db,afroarmadillo,5,Fri Jul 10 16:49:50 2015 UTC,He had a stress fracture and no one caught it? WTF?   Those can be lingering issues... Ask jrue holiday...   I don't mind if the Lakers suck and lose their pick.... Just want to see them healthy and compete...
lakers,3ct8db,redundantPOINT,10,Fri Jul 10 22:33:29 2015 UTC,Gary Vitti and Julie Soto need replacing at this point.  Lakers have a TON of money rolling in every year. If they wanted to overpay to get Phoenix's training staff once their contract expires they can totally do this
lakers,3ct8db,Akvc8,15,Fri Jul 10 18:34:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about Soto, but the Lakers org's affection for Vitti is mind boggling. Let's just look at the last 3 seasons or so.   -Allows Dwight to come back before he was anywhere near 80-90% healthy.  This not only hindered dwights ability to be healthy when we needed him most, but his subpar play led to a great deal of instability, division amongst fans/players, and left his trade value at the deadline at an all time low.   -Poor medical advice for Steve Blake. In addition to a labral tear I had the exact injuries he did (adductor tear and lower abdominal tear).  Steve saw one doc at the insistence of the lakers (I saw him as well) and ended up opting for mesh being inserted.  Modern medicine views this as problematic because it does not allow for full inspection of nerve damage, surrounding tears (like his adductor or ligaments attached to the pubic bone),  or even a deep inspection of the primary tear.  Many people experience problems with Mesh down the line and it's terribly difficult to remove or repair.  Really it reinforces the abdominal wall in a superficial way.  Steve ended up trying to come back, experienced more groin pain, had to rest even longer and then saw a second doctor (One I actually had surgery with) who uses a much better procedure that repairs the muscle.  Steve ended up getting by with a few steroid injections to his adductor as the doctor identified that his adductor tear had not fully healed.  All in all I don't know why they treated him this way.  He opted for a less effective procedure that allows atheltes to return quicker, but because he wasn't fully treated he ended up returning after the period at which he would be able to return from a traditional repair.  I studied this injury a great deal and saw nearly a dozen doctors in all.  It's clear that Blake got really poor outdated advice.    -Vitti sat and watched Mike dantoni run kobe to the ground during the regular season.  He sat right next to dantoni in that GSW game where kobe went down with injuries TWICE before finally rupturing his achilles.    -Vitti allowed kobe to return from his achilles tear early.  Say what you will, but kobe's leg buckled on him.  The lack of strength was evident through his short season and on that play in particular.   Kobe was overcompensating for physical weaknesses.  AGAIN, kobe was played too many minutes.    -We also saw vitti bungle Pau's issues with tendanitis.  Aside from the playoffs pau was the healthiest bull this season and was healthier than any year since 08-09.   -Everyone knew kobe played too many minutes the last few seasons yet once again we see Vitti blow it.  Kobe played 2-3 minutes more per game than he agreed to with scott BEFORE the season.  Kobe first saw his current shoulder issue in the PRESEASON, yet nothing.  Kobe had experienced increased shoulder pain in the games leading up to his final one where he actually Ripped the cartilage from the bone.    -Now we see that they had more than a clue that Randle had an underlying issue before the leg break.  The freaking dude has a huge frame, was being rushed back into shape (byron scott insane camp), pre-existing foot issues and you shrug your shoulders when he says theres a bump on his leg and he's experiencing pain???!!?!  It's insane how Vitti not only still has a job with the lakers, but there has been very little criticism of him.  I'm only touching upon a few of the major problems over the last few years.  Maybe vitti can't speak up when it comes to limiting minutes for kobe, but holy fucking shit if kobe has a shoulder strain in preseason, and randle reports a bump/fears his leg will break then there should be red flags everywhere.  I found it funny that grant hill opted to sign with the suns because he ""wanted to win a ring"" instead of the lakers (didn't even return phil's phone call.  But I highly doubt Hill would have had the solid years he did in phoenx with LA.  He probably would have fallen apart just like nash did.    It's not a primary problem, but if I was a free agent I would be concerned about the quality of the laker's medical staff.    TLDR:  Whether Kobe, dwight, or randle Vitti has continually failed when we needed good medical advice the most.  Something is not right."
lakers,3ct8db,Bballreasons,2,Fri Jul 10 19:41:24 2015 UTC,"As your comment shows, they have a track record of dropping the ball on injuries. Playing guys too many minutes, not allowing players to heal long enough, or just straight up now taking a close enough look at the injury. There's a growing body of data on injury prevention and recovery that every team should be looking thoroughly through to determine the effects various factors play. Based on the Lakers complete dismissal of analytics tho I doubt they are taking the kind of approach here that they should be.  The NBA just this week announced they have commissioned a team to do exactly that, but I guarantee you teams like the Suns, Rockets, and Mavs have already been doing so on their own."
lakers,3ct8db,Lightning14,3,Sat Jul 11 01:05:29 2015 UTC,I've been saying we should fire him since Dwight's issues
lakers,3ct8db,WhiteKidMAADCity,2,Sat Jul 11 00:24:06 2015 UTC,"Dude, people have been calling for Vitti's head for 15 years. He sucks.   That being said, he has no control over the minutes guys play. His job is to keep them on the floor, but he can't override the coach. Can he?  I've never seen a trainer do that anywhere."
lakers,3ct8db,CapnGrundlestamp,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:45:16 2015 UTC,"I did mention that Vitti can't easily limit kobe's minutes but he medically clears players at multiple stages.  When randle says he has a bump on his leg and pain and fears it will break, maybe do your due diligence.  When Nash, Farmar, and Kelly all have hamstring injuries maybe rest them fully before bringing them back early only to have the injury get worse until they're out for 2 months.    They have doctors for a reason.  To cover their asses.  Vitti isn't just there to hold a clipboard, the lakers rely on him to accurately assess and monitor the health of players.  Those decisions can be career altering.  Look at Wade with two meniscuses removed.  Look at Brandon Roy rushing back to the playoffs from knee surgery, put up an epic performance, but utterly destroy his knees and never be the same player again."
lakers,3ct8db,Bballreasons,8,Sat Jul 11 18:43:51 2015 UTC,He had a possible stress fracture and no one did anything about it? I know hindsight is 20/20 but i would expect the Lakers to be doing everything to protect their investments.

lakers,3ct8db,FatalErrorr,4,Fri Jul 10 17:39:03 2015 UTC,"Should have been an automatic x-ray and MRI.  Javale mcgee and bradley beal are two of the players who had TERRIBLE stress fracture experiences in their legs the season prior. We've watched multiple players (ware/george) in the year or two before break legs.    Stress reactions/fractures are the type of injuries that require a great deal of attention as they can spiral out of control if you don't allow them to heal properly.  It's like a hamstring injury in that once the reaction/tear reaches a certain point you can easily reinjure/aggravate/inflame it by coming back too soon.  Look at how terribly they treated Hamstring injuries in Nash, Kelly, and Farmar over the last year.  They would come back after a few weeks and then reinjure it, rest a few more and injure it even worse, miss a month or two and then look alrightish.   I can't believe they dropped the ball again."

lakers,3ctxmp,avengedteddy,7,Sat Jul 11 02:29:54 2015 UTC,"Well its tough to say... it can go either way.  KD is a UFA next season. Is this laker squad appealing enough for him to say goodbye to OKC (w/ westbrook and ibaka)? It may have been easier to convince him next year if we have LA or deandre jordan. But only maybe... who knows what he thinks of these 2 players?  But by the same token, LAL will have enough money next year to sign 2 max contracts. They can easily say, ""Hey KD, pick a FA you want and we will sign both of you."" Kind of like what happened in MIA but no one needs to take a paycut AND LAL has a young core with russell, clarkson, and randle (with bird rights). LAL has never been afraid to sign with luxury tax so we can have a dynasty sooner than later if the latter happens."
lakers,3ctxmp,bul1dog,4,Fri Jul 10 20:44:18 2015 UTC,"I was pulling for 2016 cap flexibility too (hoping that we'd lure Durant with the option of bringing 1 or 2 of his buddies MIA style), until I saw the 2016 UFA class. Pretty underwhelming."
lakers,3ctxmp,avengedteddy,3,Fri Jul 10 20:49:07 2015 UTC,wow damn you are right. Excitement is gone. KD is the only one in there. Hopefully there are some players that opt out of their contract that are better next year (not sure who they would be).
lakers,3ctxmp,neelium,2,Fri Jul 10 21:02:16 2015 UTC,"What about Whiteside, though? KD, Whiteside, resign Hibbert at a reasonable rate. Kobe if he feels like another year. Someone at SF. That'd be a good mix of youth and veteran experience on the team. Obviously, there are some huge IFs there in terms of actually signing those guys."
lakers,3ctxmp,avengedteddy,3,Fri Jul 10 21:40:47 2015 UTC,"Whiteside has some nice ceiling but if i am KD, I don't know if I would go to LAL with just whiteside. That doesn't sound like a championship team. Russel/Clarkson/KD/Randle/Whiteside. That may be the same level as OKC now for the 4th to 6th spot (unless Russel/clarkson/randle become all-stars which isnt impossible either) but I can't see that team topping spurs (if they keep everybody), GSW, clippers."

Great news for Conley/Gordon/Batum/Horford and those type of guys. Dudes are gonna get paid.  2017 seems to be where it's at. No idea who is going to be available, and 2 years is so long in the NBA that I don't think we can make realistic predictions, but Curry/Griffin/Westbrook/Parsons/Ibaka/Rose/DeRozan and Howard (which I don't think is relevant for Lakers) there is some real starpower at UFA. By that time, these players should also have a clearer picture of what Russell/Randle/Clarkson (and maybe Upshaw/Nance) are/are going to be."
lakers,3ctxmp,FuriousFlex,2,Sat Jul 11 11:31:46 2015 UTC,The only positive would have been for next year free agencies would have came to us because we had Aldridge and a young core that can ball out as the 2nd unit or so...

lakers,3ctxmp,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Fri Jul 10 23:54:41 2015 UTC,That's what a few of us were saying on here: no need to sign players just for the sake of signing unless it was DJ or LMA.

lakers,3cu5qc,readduh,8,Fri Jul 10 20:18:04 2015 UTC,"Madsen's Roster Breakdown  Tarik Black: “Tarik is a great leader. Tarik is vocal. Tarik is someone who, in the right way, challenges his teammates. In the right way, he challenges the staff. He asks excellent questions. He has a brilliant mind. He has the ability to be rugged on the inside and throw people around in the paint, and he can also run. When it’s time to be a tow truck, he can be a tow truck. When it’s time to be a Ferrari, he can be a Ferrari. And the biggest thing is he cleans up every rebound. Tarik’s outside shot continues to develop every day. He can shoot and make the jump hook with either hand.”  Anthony Brown: “Anthony Brown is an excellent spot-up shooter, very locked in and aware of exactly what is trying to be accomplished on offense and on defense. Anthony can finish at the rim. Anthony is a tremendous defender. I believe Anthony can defend twos, threes and some four-men.”  Jabari Brown: “Jabari Brown is a tremendous shooter. He’s a physically imposing player, and he’ s a guy who has the unique ability to drive so hard to the basket that the defense is forced to foul him. Jabari brings a level of toughness. Being from Oakland, there’s a level of work ethic. There’s a level of toughness. There’s a level of leadership that comes with that.”  Dwight Buycks: “Dwight has been gone for the Summer League thus far, but I know Dwight because he was on our team last year. Dwight is an explosive scorer. He can hit the open man. He has a very nice jump shot. Dwight went through a personal loss, and he’s been attending a funeral. So we grieve with him, we support him and we’re excited to get him back on the team.”  Jordan Clarkson: “The level of work that Jordan has put in over this last year is absolutely incredible, and it’s paying dividends. Monday after practice, he stayed late and would not leave the court until he finished his shooting progression. His legs were dead. That type of meticulous hunger to improve is something that has taken Jordan Clarkson to the level that he is right now.”  Will Davis II: “Will Davis is a smart player, a runner, someone who has a true go-to shot in his jump hook — and we saw that already in various practice sessions. When you teach Will something, he learns it the first time, and he is extremely coachable. Will battles inside in the paint. Will is vocal on defense, and yet he’s not a flamboyant person or player. He lets his play do the talking.”  Tony Mitchell: “Tony oozes confidence. Tony is someone who has excellent range on his shot. He can nail the 3. He can put the ball down. And he’s a worker. Anytime that you’ve spent time in the D-League or have become the MVP of a European league, there’s a presence there that’s a love and passion for the game to travel overseas.”  Xavier Munford: “A silent assassin. Xavier at the point guard can pull up and nail a 3 off the dribble. He can take the ball inside using the Eurostep and a variety of different finishes: high off the glass, spinning the ball different ways. Xavier is someone who can organize a team, lead a team and get everyone in the right position.”  Larry Nance, Jr.: “Larry Nance is always trying to get better. He’s always asking vocal questions to the staff and to Byron (Scott) to better understand how he can expand his game. He attacks the game with a ferocity and with an explosiveness. He’s a very capable shooter. If anything, I would like to see him expand and use his jump shot even more, because he’s an excellent shooter.”  Julius Randle: “Julius Randle has done a great job of being consistent over the summer. Last year at this time in the Summer League scenario, he wasn’t even practicing with the team, and that was because there was a contract situation that had not yet been finalized. Where Julius is right now today compared to last year is night and day. The fans are gonna be really excited to see how he has changed his body. He’s lost about 15 pounds.  ""... And the thing that I also like that Julius has done a good job of is being an extension of Byron Scott on the court. So Julius is now telling guys where to go, helping guys with defensive rotations, because he’s a really smart player and has that ability to see what’s happening on the court and then communicate it to his teammate. Every player that plays the game of basketball is different. Some players are always communicating, but they’re communicating the wrong things or they may not know the defensive scheme. Or other players know it, but they don’t say it. So it’s nice that Julius knows it (and) he’s vocal enough to say it.”  D’Angelo Russell: “So far what I can tell people about D’Angelo Russell is that he has an unbelievable gift to pass the basketball. I think that, as he plays more and more in the Summer League and NBA level, that gift will continue to expand and grow and flourish. Every great point guard does it in a different way. Magic Johnson had the one-handed passes and the no-look passes going. D’Angelo sees angles. He sees where defenses are moving, and then he’s able to exploit the rotations. D’Angelo loves to get people wide-open layups, wide-open dunks and wide-open 3-point shots. We’ve seen that.  ""His mid-range jumper is very good. He hits some 3’s. Anytime a college player comes up to the NBA, they have to adjust from a college 3-point line, which is a little closer than an NBA 3-point line, and he’s doing a nice job about that. I think the fans are going to be excited about D’Angelo. I think D’Angelo himself will be excited to get out there and start integrating himself at this level.”  Robert Upshaw: “Robert Upshaw is a defensive presence. Robert Upshaw has surprising touch in terms of the mid-range. He’s got a nice jump hook over his left shoulder. He has the ability to duck into the paint and score with either hand. Robert could impact and change a game without even taking a shot, (but) with his defensive prowess. I think Robert’s timing and his attention to detail in terms of defensive rotations allow him to do that.”"

lakers,3cqhqs,misterrunon,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:32:08 2015 UTC,"According to Cuban, the Mavs are going into tank mode with Jordan going back to the Clips, so almost impossible not to finish ahead of them.  edit: brain fart."
lakers,3cqhqs,ClearAsNight,3,Fri Jul 10 04:43:28 2015 UTC,"You probably already saw that Cuban denied they are tanking and are continuing to make trades/FA-moves that can move the team forward.  I never understood why people thought tanking was realistic after Jordan reneged.  It would be too controversial, even for Cuban, to go for an obviously intentional tank after talking to the media about it.  While that 25k fine was technically for talking about contracts before the moratorium ended, it was more likely targeting his tank comments.  Beyond that, the mavs made other FA moves based on DJ's commitment that would make tanking a tough prospect."

lakers,3cqhqs,ClearAsNight,0,Fri Jul 10 08:46:34 2015 UTC,Wes is an upgrade over Monta.
lakers,3cqhqs,Reggie_MiIler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:48:49 2015 UTC,No way. Monta carried those guys to the playoffs.
lakers,3cqhqs,TheWizard77,3,Fri Jul 10 08:55:41 2015 UTC,Monta was hanging by a thread for the entire second half of the season after the Rondo trade.  It was Aminu's defensive effort and bench scoring that carried the mavs through the last few weeks of the season when it almost looked like they were going to slide out of playoff contention.  That's why he got that deal.
lakers,3cqhqs,myLeftTesticleofFury,2,Fri Jul 10 16:38:20 2015 UTC,"Nah, Wes is one of the best wing defenders in the league, can create his own shot, high IQ and one of the most efficient 3 point shooters in the league.  Monta is an incredibly one dimensional player."
lakers,3cqhqs,Reggie_MiIler,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:13:22 2015 UTC,"You know Wes is coming back from a torn achilles right? Even if your argument holds for last season, there's no telling how his recovery goes for this season. He may not even be ready to play on opening day."
lakers,3cqhqs,Lightning14,8,Sat Jul 11 01:20:51 2015 UTC,"I think 7th is very, very optimistic.  Maybe 8th.  Out of last season's top 8, DAL and POR drop out.  OKC, assuming everyone's healthy, jumps back in.  SAC, if they can right the ship, has a ton of talent but too many headaches so we'll see.  Jury out on PHX as well, they may be in the hunt, but I think UTH makes it before the Lakers do."
lakers,3cqhqs,hoverbikes,4,Fri Jul 10 00:49:36 2015 UTC,Some have an argument that PHX and UTH aren't up and coming as you'd think.
lakers,3cqhqs,Titanosaurus,8,Fri Jul 10 01:06:07 2015 UTC,"PHX didn't look very good after all the trades during the season, so I buy that.  Maybe they need time to gel and maybe Chandler helps, who knows.  Hence the ""jury's out.""  UTH I'm willing to bet will do better than the Lakers.  Finished 19-10 post-ASG and Kanter trade with a healthy 5+ point differential (as a reference, the only teams who topped 5+ for the season were GSW, ATL, SAS and LAC).  Wasn't just an easy schedule as they had wins over West playoff teams (MEM, SAS, HOU, DAL, PORx2, NOP) during that span too.  Returning almost all of the guys who played meaningful minutes during that span, they're mostly young and getting a year more experience.  Small sample size, I know, but it's promising."
lakers,3cqhqs,hoverbikes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:29:37 2015 UTC,"I do think that UTH is in way better shape than PHX, and us here in LALa have some much to look forward to."

lakers,3cqhqs,SATW121310,19,Fri Jul 10 00:02:19 2015 UTC,All he needs to do is block shots and get a couple rebounds. There will be enough offense with our young guns and Kobe
lakers,3cqhqs,Schneeky,23,Fri Jul 10 00:17:11 2015 UTC,All he needs to do is block shots    aight   and get a couple rebounds.   lol
lakers,3cqhqs,XC_Stallion92,8,Fri Jul 10 00:34:27 2015 UTC,Well a couple is technically two so he isn't wrong
lakers,3cqhqs,arkansastraffic,3,Fri Jul 10 03:29:26 2015 UTC,Well he averaged 7 rebounds last year but im expecting like 5 or so
lakers,3cqhqs,Schneeky,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:17:38 2015 UTC,Lol I was kidding. He's not the best rebounder but yeah he'll still pull down a decent amount.  It shouldn't be much of a problem if he's playing with Randle.
lakers,3cqhqs,arkansastraffic,4,Fri Jul 10 07:24:06 2015 UTC,"Take care of Jordan Hill for us, Pacers fan"
lakers,3cqhqs,Schneeky,2,Fri Jul 10 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"He hasn't always performed the best under pressure.  Being loved though might be all that is needed.  Or he could pout and self destruct first time Kobe yells at him.  To me the upside is if he manages to become semi-competent offensively again, you will have the inside track to resigning him and making the team a brighter spot for an MVP contender to sign or be traded to.  Heck, his contract his big enough it could be used to salary match a disgruntled all-star that wants out and traded to LA."

lakers,3cqhqs,Iraq619,8,Fri Jul 10 03:46:50 2015 UTC,"No doubt, it's almost unrealistic how horrible he was. It's just he rebounded (no pun intended) last season back to how he was before that fiasco. Can't hold that against him forever."

lakers,3cqhqs,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Thu Jul 9 23:38:30 2015 UTC,"I mean he IS slow, that's why Bird traded him -- he wanted the Pacers to run an uptemto system and Hibbert was not very useful in that kind of system.   But in terms of value, he is still a very very good rim protector who will help shore up our defense. Hopefully we'll send our second unit to run and gun while the starters play a bit slower.   Or I guess Hibbert and Kobe can just trail behind while D'Angelo, Clarkson and Randle all run out in transition like bats out of hell"
lakers,3cqhqs,Paladinoras,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"Sometimes he doesn't make it to the offensive side because fast breaks /extended fast breaks, and you're like,""Did he fall down?""

He is a legitimately good dude who has worked incredibly hard to become an important NBA player. He's unorthodox, frustrating on offense, and has several other well documented flaws--but he'll change your defensive identity, he'll be a good teammate, he'll be loyal to your city, and he'll even play Xbox with you.   After seven years, I feel sad to see him go, but it's ultimately better for both parties. Take care of him!"

I know the pacers wanted to go undersized but if Larry bird has worries about him I'm a little concerned. If it's motivation that's one thing.  Kobe is the ultimate motivator. If it's something else I'm concerned. For the record, playoffs at least. Hopefully a second round. Kobe and the ah hem coach  has to show the young bucks the rope to a longer season.  Edit : the more I think about it, the more I like a better interior d. With him clogging the lane with our perimeter d, we could have some opportunities against weaker teams. We will still have problems with gs and okc, I love our chances against teams like San Antonio or Portland. And I know San Antonio is a pile of bs right now but we are better with interior d.   Please, correct me if I'm wrong.  I love our team this year and especially next year."

lakers,3cryk2,Flagcap,21,Fri Jul 10 08:17:46 2015 UTC,"No problem, I appreciate him enough for all the work he did in what I considered a wasted season since we didn't even get to the Finals."
lakers,3cryk2,DinoDonkeyDoodle,14,Fri Jul 10 11:17:19 2015 UTC,"On top of the Zen ConnectionTM, I am happy Number 16 went to you guys. Pau is a beautiful and majestic unicorn. He will always be a Laker to me, but I am glad he is in a retirement home that loves him and built the career of our greatest coach ever. Godspeed brother in ballin'."
lakers,3cryk2,thevisitor,17,Fri Jul 10 15:28:31 2015 UTC,Bulls have always been my favorite team from the east. May both our franchises do well this upcoming year!
lakers,3cryk2,FuriousFlex,4,Fri Jul 10 08:39:11 2015 UTC,"Same here. It will be interesting to see Russell adapt to playing on and off Kobe, from the interview it seemed he was very mature, kind of like from the same mold as Julius's attitude."

lakers,3cryk2,BayStyles,7,Fri Jul 10 11:21:15 2015 UTC,Hibbert is pretty good man. He mauled our big guys in years past. Nice big body to have especially against a league where bigs are coming back.

lakers,3cryk2,BayStyles,3,Fri Jul 10 08:31:28 2015 UTC,"Seems.. umm, Phil-esque? Idk, I get the feeling that this guy isn't going to be so hard on our guys and form relations with the rowdiest and keep him in check. He has been working closely with our guys from what I hear and is about to visit Pau off in Spain."
lakers,3cryk2,mistersabs,10,Fri Jul 10 11:25:02 2015 UTC,hey lets make a trade sacre for jimmy butler straight up
lakers,3cryk2,avengedteddy,33,Fri Jul 10 09:18:25 2015 UTC,This right here is what annoys me so much about laker fans. Sacre for Butler? You serious?? Do you even watch NBA bro? That's why everyone on /r/nba laughs at us....All these lopsided trades....  Bulls would need to package in DRose AND Pau with Butler to even entertain the thought of us trading the GOAT Sacre ;)
lakers,3cryk2,k4f123,13,Fri Jul 10 09:48:49 2015 UTC,"I just thought with all these years that we've fucked other teams in trades, it's time to give back."

lakers,3cryk2,TuneHD,3,Fri Jul 10 15:39:51 2015 UTC,"On a serious note, from the way it looks. You guys need a 3&D guy to play SF, (besides asking us for Jimmy) who would you think can fill that void?"
lakers,3cryk2,avengedteddy,3,Fri Jul 10 15:42:49 2015 UTC,"Heck for how much you signed Mike Dunleavy for, I'd definitely trade you Swaggy for him, straight up."
lakers,3cryk2,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:20:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Dunleavy signing was the steal of the FA period.  He's a bargain at that price."

lakers,3cryk2,khighyle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:26:08 2015 UTC,Hopefully KD in 2016. All signs seem to point to Kobe playing SF next season. I think the Lakers could possibly still add a guy like Dorell Wright who's from L.A. or perhaps KJ McDaniels.
lakers,3cryk2,Equalizer101,2,Fri Jul 10 15:44:06 2015 UTC,"Oh I will also add, he is an extremely decent stand up guy. This was the pre-season game in Indy when Rose came back from his torn-acl and Hibbert tapped Rose on the side to let him know he was setting a pick and motioned to him if he was alright."

lakers,3cryk2,Liquorpuki,2,Fri Jul 10 11:32:52 2015 UTC,Bulls has been my favorite team in the east also. Thanks for the love!
lakers,3cufz2,Sports_Later,15,Fri Jul 10 21:37:48 2015 UTC,All I want is for us to be competitive again. These last two years have been dreadful to watch. That ends now.
lakers,3cufz2,Buckelroo,7,Fri Jul 10 21:43:00 2015 UTC,The hype is getting absurd.  Half our starting lineup is on the summer league roster.   The other half is either coming off season ending injury was willingly given up just to get them out of town.  People are buying jerseys for undrafted Free Agents.  Now they're talking about making the playoffs in a stacked western conference where you can win 45+ games and be in the lottery.  Calm Down bros. Let's just be interesting and competitive this year. Next year will be the time to shine.
lakers,3cufz2,amarstan,12,Sat Jul 11 00:20:25 2015 UTC,"If we were in the Easy, I mean, eastern conference"
lakers,3cufz2,pistolpete4407,5,Fri Jul 10 22:41:47 2015 UTC,"Really all depends on a lot of things.  How healthy and how good is Kobe still?  How good are Russell, Clarkson, and Randle?  Does Hibbert still have it?"
lakers,3cufz2,hitmanrva10,3,Fri Jul 10 22:23:53 2015 UTC,"To be realistic here...absolutely not. I am a huge lakers fan and we have to really look at the outlook of the west. Frankly, we don't have enough experienced talent to compete with the other playoff bottomfeeders: Phoenix, Pelicans, OKC, even the Kings. What is promising is our young talent, and sure enough we will grow and be back in the thick of things within a few seasons."
lakers,3cufz2,tuioop,3,Fri Jul 10 22:51:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have to agree. I do see us maybe hitting that 9th or 10th spot, I think that is definitely possible..but we'll probably fall short of the 8th seed.  edit: BUT like Haiko said, if another team succumbs to injuries like some teams do, then you never know!  next year should be a different story wit FA and all, and besides, we've had 16 chips.. 5 in the last decade almost.. I think we can be patient a year or so while we rebuild lol"
lakers,3cufz2,ShaneMichaelOfficial,7,Sat Jul 11 01:19:37 2015 UTC,7-8 seed at best. And that's hoping other teams fuck up.
lakers,3cufz2,Haiko248,0,Fri Jul 10 22:17:57 2015 UTC,"We'll be the 7th or 8th seed if a few western conference teams planes crash into the ground.  We have 3 or 4 rookies, one of a season ender last year, and Kobe, and a shitty Hibbert.  Calm those expectations!"
lakers,3cufz2,Roike,3,Sat Jul 11 03:13:16 2015 UTC,Portland and Dallas are awful now.
lakers,3cufz2,Haiko248,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:16:28 2015 UTC,"And OKC isn't.  And we are.  I'm not hating, but rookies are almost NEVER playoff good.  EDIT: Dallas is MUCH better than we are atm, barring some crazy unprecedented breakouts by rookies."
lakers,3cufz2,Roike,3,Sat Jul 11 03:26:00 2015 UTC,"A 10 seed would be categorized as a very good season with this roster. Anyone thinking this is a playoff team is delusional or else works for the Lakers and is making a press announcement (so therefore can't tell the truth about the team). Right off the bat, the Warriors, rockets, clippers, Spurs, Grizzlies will absolutely be higher. That is 5 teams. Now, odds are high that the Pelicans and thunder will also be higher. That is a total of 7 teams. Other teams likely to finish ahead include the Mavs, Portland, and suns. That is 10 teams. I can see the lakers getting by the Kings, nuggets, and jazz, but that only puts them at 11."

No serious injuries, rookies playing great, etc. and then it still depends on the other teams. But realistically we'll miss it but at least we're on the upswing and getting the rookies a lot of experience."

lakers,3cu8an,FuriousFlex,10,Sat Jul 11 03:01:02 2015 UTC,I listened.. It was uncomfortable because Mase has been trash talking Mitch all summer.
lakers,3cu8an,aveydey,9,Fri Jul 10 21:14:39 2015 UTC,"Yup, lost all respect for the guy during this offseason. Yes, our FO is old school, yes they've whiffed on the marquee fa's a few times over the past couple offseasons, but this is still Mitch ""I-have-a-reputation-of-fleecing-other-GMs-but-I'm-still-going-to-fleece-you-and-you'll-like-it"" Kupchak and Mason is calling for his head and for our FO to be cleaned out?   I get frustrated for other franchises watching their GM's habitually and idiotically make irrational decisions, e.g. Kahn taking back-to-back pg's with the 5 & 6 and neither being named Stephen or Hinkie drafting Noel, Embiid, Okafor, JP, and then trading for 2 more bigs.   One day Mitch will retire, and we'll be left at the mercy of Jimmy Buss and whichever GM he thinks is fit to fill the role. That will be a dark day in Lakerland, and I want that day to elude us for as long as humanly possible. In short, GTFO of here Steve Mason."
lakers,3cu8an,bul1dog,2,Fri Jul 10 21:42:39 2015 UTC,Yeah dude. I'm usually a big fan of Mason but he has been really annoying lately.
lakers,3cu8an,aveydey,3,Fri Jul 10 22:22:16 2015 UTC,"Fuuuuuck Mason. I can't even listen to the show when John's not there and they're talking Lakers.

lakers,3cu8an,aveydey,6,Sat Jul 11 02:49:31 2015 UTC,So what he say?
lakers,3cu8an,ILikeChocolateMilkk,4,Fri Jul 10 20:42:41 2015 UTC,Basically that Upshaw might not even play in the game tonight and he has a lot of work to do just to show he's ready to be on the court. Said it was way too early to know if he could have an impact on the team or earn a roster spot.  It didn't leave me feeling at all optimistic about his chances. I guess we should have seen this coming after the FO decided to guarantee Sacre's deal this year.
lakers,3cu8an,avengedteddy,14,Fri Jul 10 20:51:47 2015 UTC,thats kupchak's way. he challenges players through the media. he isn't going to praise someone that just got himself kicked out of 2 schools because he (upshaw) thought he was higher than everybody else. Praise might not be the best thing for upshaw right now because it can get to his head. Upshaw really needs to prove it not only in practice but when he receives playing time. I think Upshaw will be playing more in the later SL games then.
lakers,3cu8an,UltraFlyingTurtle,2,Fri Jul 10 21:31:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. Bummer about Mitch's take on Upshaw. Upshaw did looked really gassed in that 5-on-5 scrimmage from yesterday, and said in the interview he was out of shape.   I still have hope. He's got a few months before the season starts -- plenty of time to get his conditioning and get another chance to show his skills. And he sounds like he really wants to be a Laker.  Really wish Lakers still give him a contract on the cheap, if he shows some flashes of talent in the Summer League. I would so hate some other team to nab him, and he becomes a force in a year or two."
lakers,3cu8an,rejectx,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:11:08 2015 UTC,"we already knew that he is way out of shape, but I still hoped that he could make our roster."
lakers,3cu8an,ShadyVille_Int,5,Fri Jul 10 21:04:46 2015 UTC,Didn't hear that interview but apparently he might not even play tonight. I hope they are keeping him under the covers till they make enough room to officially sign him

lakers,3cu8an,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Fri Jul 10 22:49:20 2015 UTC,What'd he say about analytics?
lakers,3cu8an,megavino,5,Fri Jul 10 21:11:02 2015 UTC,"Well he seemed really surprised that Mason had access to SportsVu. Kind of like he was shocked that people besides himself had access to that sort of information. Then he talked about how the Lakers use that info, such as a couple of guys with PhDs crunch all the data and put it in a presentable form for their analytics liaison to the coaching staff, Mark Madsen."
lakers,3cu8an,avengedteddy,2,Fri Jul 10 21:18:57 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry too much about that. Upshaw came here by choice and an udfa. Mitch can't hype up an undrafted guy without being laughed at by other gms and its probably not good for upshaw to be hyped up before playing a game and he prolly does need to get into shape. Hopefully he balls out and this is a non issue.

lakers,3cti0i,koleif91,8,Fri Jul 10 17:24:59 2015 UTC,i did see an interview last night with Mitch and he said he'd be driving to Las Vegas today with the contracts and the rooks might sign them then. probably before tip-off.   it is possible that they may play in the Summer League without having them signed yet but that is at the discretion of the player and his agent.
lakers,3cti0i,readduh,3,Fri Jul 10 17:30:19 2015 UTC,Why would he drive?

lakers,3cti0i,FreshDiamond,4,Fri Jul 10 23:13:43 2015 UTC,"you can still play even if you are not signed, I have no idea why Julius missed some games last year. We need every cent now we can get so don't worry."
lakers,3cti0i,rejectx,4,Fri Jul 10 17:29:14 2015 UTC,I wouldn't want to play unsigned...what if you get injured?
lakers,3cti0i,probotic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:50:19 2015 UTC,"His contract is still guaranteed. We can pay him anywhere from 80%-120% of the rookie scale IIRC. While it's definitely smart to just go ahead and sign so you don't get that 80% contract, perhaps he's doing this so he can prove that he deserves the full 120%.   Worst case scenario, Russell gets injured, but I still don't see us ""low balling"" him at 80%"

lakers,3cti0i,FreshDiamond,2,Fri Jul 10 23:12:17 2015 UTC,Rookies can't play in Summer League unsigned. I recall Randle getting signed right before tip off last year.

lakers,3ctmd1,KaosAlpha,5,Fri Jul 10 17:56:39 2015 UTC,"The Hibbert trade pushed the team to $100,000 over the salary cap.   Probably wouldn't make sense to keep Jabari, if that's the case. I like him, but it's not worth becoming salary cap offenders. Hopefully we can unload Kelly somewhere, and keep Brown (or sign Upshaw)."
lakers,3ctmd1,bul1dog,2,Fri Jul 10 19:04:40 2015 UTC,I definitely don't want to give up Jabari. I'd rather send out Sacre and it'd be a toss-up for Jabari and Kelly. Leaning more towards keeping Jabari.
lakers,3ctmd1,TuneHD,2,Fri Jul 10 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"Anthony Brown for a 3 year deal is AWESOME.  Usually rookies who were projected to be first rounders that slip into the second will insist on only signing for 2 years, hoping that they can ""show off"" and hit free agency faster."

lakers,3ctmd1,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Fri Jul 10 21:20:39 2015 UTC,Why would we overpay Russel and Nance? Is it to get longer contracts or something?
lakers,3ctmd1,Ksanti,3,Fri Jul 10 21:46:32 2015 UTC,The cap hold on rookies is 100% of the tiered rookie salary but every team will traditionally offer the maximum 120% instead. They delay signing because it gives that slight cap room until the larger number is signed.
lakers,3ctmd1,tornadodolphin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:28:08 2015 UTC,"Oh so is it basically a ""we believe in you"" thing that costs very little and it would be kind of rude/pointless to sign them to the tiered rookie salaries unless you have a very tight amount of cap space to work with?"
lakers,3ctmd1,Ksanti,2,Fri Jul 10 22:41:50 2015 UTC,More of a never happens otherwise unless the team is really cheap.
lakers,3ctmd1,tornadodolphin,2,Sat Jul 11 00:35:22 2015 UTC,"Instead the two-time All-Star will receive a bonus of just $78,185.   sucks to be him"

lakers,3ctya8,_Wi11,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:22:54 2015 UTC,Nance will probably be a beast. Dunking every thing.
lakers,3cvo4e,ShaneMichaelOfficial,16,Sat Jul 11 04:01:37 2015 UTC,Improve because we need to be worse than this year to get the pick and I can't see that happening with the team next season.
lakers,3cvo4e,_FreshG,3,Sat Jul 11 04:04:38 2015 UTC,"I agree. We need to improve and not tank. Next year's draft is supposedly pretty weak, and not much depth, plus our pick is top-3 protected. Look at NY, they tried tanking harder than us and got the 2nd worse seed and still only got the 4th pick.  Last year, we were 6th worse but got the 7th pick.  We got lucky to have gotten the 2nd pick this year.  Totally not worth risking another year of tanking for a slight chance at retaining our pick. Also we're a better team on paper than last year so it would harder to tank this year."
lakers,3cvo4e,UltraFlyingTurtle,4,Sat Jul 11 04:44:34 2015 UTC,"You don't sign the 6th man of the year, a defensive center 1 year removed from finishing second DPOY, and one of the best glue guys in the league to tank. Also, you do not tank for Kobe's last season."
lakers,3cvo4e,Buckelroo,7,Sat Jul 11 04:49:24 2015 UTC,"We'd have to tank hard, because we only have a top 3 protected pick. Otherwise any pick in the first will go to the sixers.   I'd rather have our rookies learn a whole lot this year, and be middle of the pack, rather than teaching them to tank. I think this'll set us up better for the future."
lakers,3cvo4e,VladDracul_III,-1,Sat Jul 11 04:36:05 2015 UTC,"ill pretend i didnt read that  EDIT: i read too fast and realized it said ""we'd have to"" and not ""we have to""."

lakers,3cvo4e,VladDracul_III,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:13:12 2015 UTC,"i misread your comment... i thought you were implying that we tank hard.. but you said ""we'd have to tank hard"""
lakers,3cvo4e,jayrock310,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:08:45 2015 UTC,What's your suggestion?
lakers,3cvo4e,badguymatt,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:36:45 2015 UTC,what are you getting back from tanking? theres no value in next years draft. knicks tanked harder than us and got the 4th pick in return. play this season out and see where it takes them. kobe will not not let this team tank on his last year of his contract and possibly his career. thats called giving up and quitting early.
lakers,3cvo4e,jayrock310,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:06:05 2015 UTC,"there's no way we're getting that pick unless we get some serious injuries, one probably to kobe, and i dont want that to happen so i'd like so see these young players experience what its like to fight for a playoff spot (even if we dont get it)"
lakers,3ctp98,Cincybengals7,2,Fri Jul 10 18:17:22 2015 UTC,A lot of people that aren't signed play summer league. Some players chose not to because they try to gain some leverage and force he FOs to give them the contract before they play which is why you may see some players refuse to play because of it. But it depends on the player and the agent
lakers,3ctp98,santokimilktea,0,Fri Jul 10 18:24:41 2015 UTC,"Dude, they can play. Just relax."
lakers,3cvkrb,readem_n_weep,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:28:03 2015 UTC,No credit card needed. I saw tonight's game for free. The rest of the summer is only $5.  Warning: don't signup until the next Lakers game. It's one DAY.
lakers,3ct1zt,scootify,8,Fri Jul 10 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"Upshaw should probably spend sometime in the D League with the D-Fenders so that he can get more minutes, and honestly to prove that he is capable of staying on a team.  I like his upside, but as far as developing him a stint in the D League might be best."
lakers,3ct1zt,tangential_quip,5,Fri Jul 10 16:48:54 2015 UTC,The problem with this is that any team can sign him from the d-fenders.. Only 15 allowed on contract and 13 on roster so 2 players will be on the d-fenders regardless
lakers,3ct1zt,tangential_quip,3,Fri Jul 10 16:54:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, more of just something I was musing over rather than an on topic comment.  I have to think that Sacre would be the odd man out."
lakers,3ct1zt,the_wheyfinder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:59:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he hasn't played an official game since the end if 2014ish (I don't know exactly when he was cut).  Unless he shines during summer league, I would like him to get more playing time in before we commit.  That being said, super stoked for him and I hope he does really well"
lakers,3ct1zt,BABYPUBESS,5,Fri Jul 10 21:40:11 2015 UTC,As long as Upshaw doesn't do something stupid he would make the team over Kelly and sacre I think. I don't think we plan on keeping Kelly
lakers,3ct1zt,Buckelroo,10,Fri Jul 10 15:41:41 2015 UTC,"I think we do. A 6'10 3 point shooter isn't worth letting go until you're absolutely positive he's a bust, or you get a good trade. He's only 24, with 2 season in the league. And he spent most of last year trying (and failing) to play the 3. I think we give him another chance at his natural stretch 4 position. Sacre on the other hand, is no longer needed if we sign Upshaw."
lakers,3ct1zt,BABYPUBESS,9,Fri Jul 10 16:03:58 2015 UTC,Well rumor has it we were exploring trades to get rid of him. I feel at this point he's shown us all he will and its just a waste of a roster spot to keep him.
lakers,3ct1zt,TuneHD,7,Fri Jul 10 16:07:53 2015 UTC,"Kelly? He's barely gotten a chance. He's only played on tanking teams as a starter with minutes at the 3 and injuries. We'd definitely get rid of Sacre in favor of Upshaw, although I like Sacre as a great energy guy."
lakers,3ct1zt,Buckelroo,3,Fri Jul 10 16:15:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah we were trying to package him to clear cap space, which we don't need anymore. The only thing we have seen from Kelly is that he cannot play sf."
lakers,3ct1zt,harleq01,3,Fri Jul 10 16:16:32 2015 UTC,Glad to hear that im not the only one who doesnt want to trade kelly... He was great in dantonis system and a great shooter.. Letting go of sacre or swaggy makes more sense but if we need to pack kelly in to trade swaggy im all for it
lakers,3ct1zt,Buckelroo,4,Fri Jul 10 16:20:26 2015 UTC,"Last year he shot 33% from the field, it was his moment to shine with all our injuries and he played like 30-35 min when he started. His 3 point shooting is also 33% which is nothing special. I’d rather have nance as randle’s backup. And I’m not saying we shouldn’t keep Kelly, but if we can get something for him or if we have no room for him or if there is ANY reason not to have him aboard, I’d drop him in a heart beat."
lakers,3ct1zt,p0se1d0n,2,Fri Jul 10 17:46:32 2015 UTC,Last year was not his time to shine. He was playing out of position for most of the season. He's only 24 he can still become a decent stretch big off the bench.
lakers,3ct1zt,98941,5,Fri Jul 10 17:48:47 2015 UTC,"If Upshaw performs well,  I can almost guarantee you that Mitch will make moves to open up a roster spot for him.   Either Sacre, Kelly or Swaggy Clown will get Mitch-slapped"
lakers,3ct1zt,undercoverbrutha,3,Fri Jul 10 16:13:40 2015 UTC,"We have two rookies that can be tried at small forward.  I would rather see Brown and Nance get the playing time, instead of signing a free agent small forward.  They need the playing time to develop and for the Lakers to see if they are going to be NBA level starters, bench players or scrubs.  This will also leave a roster spot for Upshaw and he can be rotated between the defenders and Lakers rosters."
lakers,3ct1zt,rejectx,2,Fri Jul 10 19:51:18 2015 UTC,We don't have to sign a SF... We can just run with an extra center. And also if everything goes right sacre won't ever see the court
lakers,3ct1zt,ModulationLobbyist,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:16:41 2015 UTC,we wouldn't sign upshaw to the room level anyways so might as well pick up a player worth the 2.8mil

lakers,3ct1zt,numbnutsnz,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:13:31 2015 UTC,"Do NBA teams have first right of refusal on their affiliated D-League teams? If so, couldn't we just match any minimum level (since we are at the cap limit already) offer for Upshaw from the D-League? (Of course, after making the appropriate moves to free up roster space.)"
lakers,3ct1zt,spoolx,2,Fri Jul 10 18:28:59 2015 UTC,"eams? If so, couldn't we just match any minimum level (since we are at the cap limit already) offer for Upshaw from the D-League? (Of course, after making the appropriate moves to free up roster space.)   they don't"
lakers,3ct1zt,WOX_69,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:32:15 2015 UTC,"I think mitch's comments today were rooted in giving a reality check to upshaw.  He's gotten a lot of buzz here in LA and he's clearly not in peak shape.  He needs a bit of a fire kept there to keep him in line.    Also, he knows we won't have randle vs. okafor saturday so I wouldn't be surprised if we see zero-8 minutes from upshaw tonight and then he plays 20 against okafor saturday."

lakers,3cv84y,Wa1do,3,Sat Jul 11 01:31:08 2015 UTC,Randle is really rusty. Anthony Brown looks better than expected. Larry Nance is out of control.
lakers,3cv84y,NicDwolfwood,2,Sat Jul 11 01:31:26 2015 UTC,Randle seems to be forcing it a little too much.
lakers,3cv84y,javi2123,2,Sat Jul 11 01:32:53 2015 UTC,"Russell looking ok. made some good passes, playing good defense, length is legit. hasnt shown too much offensively though  JC looking sharp. mid range on point, monster put back dunk  Randle is looking very rusty, but also super strong  Nance Jr hopefully will play 2nd half  Lavine is a fucking stud. Minnesota is gonna be a fun team to watch"

lakers,3cv84y,oZiix,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:36:04 2015 UTC,"First I want to say GIVE UPSHAW THE BALL, dude was open a couple times   Randle: he is trying to be the man play, I personally don't mind because he's getting inside easily but not finishing  Jordan: beast that's all I can say  Russle : that kid can pass like a mofo  Black: he's balling on his way to a double double but already has 5 fouls in the first half   Brown: all he really is doing is shooting 3s  Nace jr : is okay"
lakers,3cvug3,YaBoiMigz,3,Sat Jul 11 05:07:41 2015 UTC,No way man. There is no point in tanking this year. Our pick is top 3 protected so fuck it lets show people we can be competitive. Really the only way I'd be happy is if we won the lottery for the Top 3. No more sucking. #Ontherise
lakers,3cvug3,steelcurtain84,2,Sat Jul 11 06:54:39 2015 UTC,Why you want to rebuild if we have a chance to sign KD next year and be a legit team already
lakers,3cvug3,spacejungler,2,Sat Jul 11 06:20:30 2015 UTC,"Because we have zero shot at signing KD.  It's either OKC, DC, or (possibly) Miami getting KD next year.  That's it."
lakers,3cvug3,StealthRUs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:21:26 2015 UTC,"you are right, we have little talent, we couldn't get Lamarcus Aldridge or Deandre Jordan, what makes you think we could get KD?"
lakers,3cvug3,StealthRUs,2,Sun Jul 12 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"I'm all in on the tank, but others here aren't. People here think we have enough talent, when the reality is (in terms of young talent) we're way behind Utah and Minnesota."
lakers,3cvug3,StealthRUs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:19:41 2015 UTC,"that's what i'm saying, we don't have enough talent yet, and the vets we just signed don't help, they show how desperate we kind of are"

Lin ended up playing like a wet tortilla and they finished the season by saying ""BYRON SCOTT IS A RACIST"""
lakers,3cqx1c,Schneeky,26,Fri Jul 10 05:00:42 2015 UTC,Lin fans are the worst.

lakers,3cqx1c,JesusSama,3,Fri Jul 10 04:57:38 2015 UTC,"If it helps, there are some people that are fine. It's always been the more vocal ones that use really narrowed down stats to 'prove' a point that will irk you. I remember seeing something where they scaled minutes, points, assists, steals and said ""look, Lin is top 20 along with allllllll these players like LeBron"".  They -can-, at times, mean well but it gets out of hand. And then there was a lot of either troll or really just delusional fans that REALLY ruin their image by crafting a LOT of conspiracy theories. A lot of racist ones, how Kobe hated Lin and had Byron hold him down to keep the spotlight on him, etc. - Those are the ones that drive you insane especially since they will ignore most counter arguments by pointing at advanced stats that they found/out of context quotes and keep crying wolf.  And, man, I'm freakin' Asian as hell and was excited for Lin but... all that just really detached me from being excited for him."
lakers,3cqx1c,aveydey,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:31:47 2015 UTC,In so so so sorry... Hornets fans don't deserve to endure the Lin Only fans. I was really hoping he would end up on the Celtics... :/

lakers,3cqx1c,Schneeky,6,Fri Jul 10 05:37:02 2015 UTC,Does Lin have any non-asian fans?
lakers,3cqx1c,aveydey,11,Fri Jul 10 02:49:52 2015 UTC,Most Laker fans did root for him and wanted him to succeed but then Lin Only Fans got really obnoxious that it actually made him lose fans.
lakers,3cqx1c,breakwater,6,Fri Jul 10 05:02:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm in this category. I was even somewhat excited when Mitch picked him up from Houston.  Then the Lin fans arrived... LOL.  It sucks too because Jeremy Lin seems like a very good man but his fans are just unbearable.

lakers,3cqx1c,undercoverbrutha,2,Fri Jul 10 15:39:47 2015 UTC,Your sub's mods should set rules.  One of the best things Lakersground did was set clear rules and make an effort to ban bullshit from both sides.  As opposed to Clutchfans or Lakersnation where troll threads have a multi year lifespan and conversation devolves into racist shit
lakers,3cqx1c,dabolympian710,2,Fri Jul 10 16:00:47 2015 UTC,You have no idea... In fact most teams still have no idea. He needs to play for every fucking team so people will stop defending the lin fans
lakers,3cqx1c,FreshDiamond,3,Fri Jul 10 19:12:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly though not gonna lie, Lin came on very strong towards the end of his year with us. Post-ASG Lin was a bright spot on the team. He'll be a strong addition for you guys at 4 mil (per year or total either way is a great deal).  But ya his fans can be really annoying. I was a big fan of his abilities before it became obvious that the LOF's are no stereotype."
lakers,3cqx1c,VladDracul_III,3,Fri Jul 10 03:36:26 2015 UTC,Yeah I mean Lin is a really good player. He isn't the guy from New York but I think he is an ideal sixth man back up pg
lakers,3cqx1c,Notalent13,2,Fri Jul 10 04:35:03 2015 UTC,The Lin fans might not be as bad this year. They could be evenly spread between Lin and Mudiay now since he played in China for a year.
lakers,3cqx1c,Markdanielng,6,Fri Jul 10 02:03:20 2015 UTC,"Nah, its not about them playing in China, its about being Chinese. If it was about them just playing in China than JR Smith would have way more fans than Lin."
lakers,3cqx1c,WhiteAdipose,0,Fri Jul 10 02:11:09 2015 UTC,Lin isn't Chinese.
lakers,3cqx1c,Notalent13,5,Fri Jul 10 13:04:16 2015 UTC,"Sigh this argument. He may be of Taiwanese ""nationality"" (which isn't even true because he's American) but he's ethnically Chinese.  My parents are Taiwanese and I've never identified as ethnically Taiwanese because it's simply untrue."

lakers,3cqx1c,gratisfactionn,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:58:21 2015 UTC,Lin has never played in China League. He isn't even born in China. Just a normal Asian American dude from the bay who happened to be pretty good at basketball.

lakers,3cqx1c,Side-Pocket,4,Fri Jul 10 03:52:09 2015 UTC,Ahh did not think of that like I said I just saw this picture on our sub and remembered what all the Laker fans were warning me about lol

lakers,3cqx1c,TheRealMelvinGibson,-1,Fri Jul 10 01:57:10 2015 UTC,"Jeremy Lin was in my favorite top 5 current players of the NBA. I am Asian. BUT... to be clear, just because he was a favorite player does not mean I thought he was a great player. If anything I thought he was just solid, and just maybe a top 20 PG. I say ""was"" because he sucked pretty bad last year. Really disappointing."
lakers,3cqx1c,TheRealMelvinGibson,-3,Fri Jul 10 08:30:19 2015 UTC,Did they just say they want kemba to get injured? What scum.
lakers,3cqx1c,jnovprime,2,Fri Jul 10 03:34:39 2015 UTC,Nah said he is injury prone lol
lakers,3cqx1c,image_linker_bot,3,Fri Jul 10 03:35:04 2015 UTC,Haha. That's like saying don't play rose because he's injury prone. This guy has to be trolling.
lakers,3cqx1c,death_by_laughs,4,Fri Jul 10 03:44:10 2015 UTC,Kemba is not really injury prone though I mean unless missing 45 games in 4 years is injury prone lol
lakers,3cqx1c,p0se1d0n,3,Fri Jul 10 03:45:22 2015 UTC,Wow. That's actually pretty good. Lin fans are delusional.
lakers,3cqjhy,Ray3142,76,Thu Jul 9 23:42:41 2015 UTC,Clarkson is the best player on the court by a mile. Impressed by Nance. Randle got power and speed but still tunnel vision. But Clarkson looks even more athletic
lakers,3cqjhy,Scabandiri,32,Thu Jul 9 23:54:04 2015 UTC,I would say Clarkson AND Randle are the best players on the court by a mile. Don't agree with tunnel vision he had a great pass in one sequence.
lakers,3cqjhy,grungust,15,Thu Jul 9 23:56:29 2015 UTC,"Ya he did have a great pass and really great drives, but his D was lazy and he missed a very crucial easy box out when Nance dunked over him and missed a great Clarkson fade. He'll get better as he plays. This is probably his first 5 v 5 since injury so this is expected"
lakers,3cqjhy,Scabandiri,26,Fri Jul 10 00:04:24 2015 UTC,"Nance did impress me a lot, made himself stand out with that putback, the smart tip out and that crazy layup"
lakers,3cqjhy,TheImmenseFence,9,Fri Jul 10 01:27:46 2015 UTC,That tip out was great.  He has a really good sense of what's happening out there.
lakers,3cqjhy,sharkytowers76,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:31:49 2015 UTC,I can't believe that he was going to be late second round. This was just practice of course but he absolutely looked liked like a first round pick out there.
lakers,3cqjhy,lufty574,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:21:35 2015 UTC,Some good highlights there for Nance Jr. Really surprised. #inmitchwetrust
lakers,3cqjhy,harryhov,20,Fri Jul 10 14:33:20 2015 UTC,"I hope Clarkson keeps growing, and doesn't get greedy and leave for a bigger contract elsewhere in a few years... we need commitment and loyalty more than ever right now!"
lakers,3cqjhy,spudwinkle,31,Thu Jul 9 23:57:18 2015 UTC,"He's restricted, loves LA, and the organization and we have his bird rights so we can sign him for anything and it won't hurt our cap space for signing new FAs"
lakers,3cqjhy,Scabandiri,11,Fri Jul 10 00:06:03 2015 UTC,Throw him the max if need be. Fuck it. We'll sort it out when the time comes.
lakers,3cqjhy,arkansastraffic,2,Fri Jul 10 01:33:46 2015 UTC,if he continues to progress at this rate then I would have no problem going him the max. especially if dudes like Reggie Jackson are getting the max.
lakers,3cqjhy,thehumangenius23,7,Fri Jul 10 05:12:10 2015 UTC,i really see a westbrook in him. so athletic.
lakers,3cqjhy,avengedteddy,8,Fri Jul 10 00:49:36 2015 UTC,"Yea, Clarkson really stood out to me too. I did see Randle move the ball a few times in the highlights, but I thought his shot selection was ok. Will be more telling over an entire game"

lakers,3cqjhy,harleq01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:59:56 2015 UTC,and he was doing euro steps!
lakers,3cqjhy,lmaonade200,11,Fri Jul 10 14:39:20 2015 UTC,"This is pretty much exactly how Mitch planned his picks. After the JC steal there was a bunch of articles on how the Laker were going to look for things like polish, experience, NBA-readiness, fundamentals, as opposed to just raw potential deep in the draft. They weren't trying to draft the next star with a 20 something pick, they were trying to draft someone who could make an impact right away.  Nance played all 4 years of college, and has successfully come back from an ACL injury, he is definitely a lot more comfortable with his game than most of those guys out there and has definitely had more time to mature his game. Still needs transitioning to the NBA of course, but it is going to be easier for him than most rookies."
lakers,3cqjhy,Sletts,2,Fri Jul 10 03:16:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm really liking this pick. In Mitch we trust! Kid looks like he's got confidence and polish in his game.
lakers,3cqjhy,JesusSama,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:27:58 2015 UTC,"Goes to show, we should... dare I say... trust our drafting process."
lakers,3cqjhy,camlawson24,2,Fri Jul 10 17:09:37 2015 UTC,"All the guy needs to do to play an important role on this team and stick around in the NBA is maintain the level of hustle he displayed in this video. He has the athleticism and intangibles to be a really useful defensive, transition, versatile role player."
lakers,3cqjhy,Hangintherekitty,2,Fri Jul 10 01:16:31 2015 UTC,Yup! The play at 5:10 makes me think he can use some work on his left hand though.
lakers,3cqjhy,harleq01,2,Fri Jul 10 04:39:38 2015 UTC,Holy shit that euro step at 5:12 with the behind the head throw in. This kid looks comfy already.
lakers,3cqjhy,ss3happy1,0,Fri Jul 10 14:39:00 2015 UTC,Hopefully he won't lose minutes to Bradon Bass
lakers,3cqjhy,justsomeguy5,49,Fri Jul 10 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"4 take-aways from this 6 minute clip:  Larry Nance Jr. is a beast. Could be just as athletic as his dad. Very surprised to see how comfortable and assertive he was out there.  Julius Randle looks great for someone coming off 2 pretty big surgeries in less than a year. Hope he boxes out more as he regains strength in his lower body but in this clip, he just didn't have it yet.  D'Angelo Russell needs to work on his conditioning, but it will improve in time. Was very winded and at least in this 6 minute video, was a complete non-factor.  Robert Upshaw also needs to work on conditioning. I loved that kept trying to contest shots even though his legs weren't quite there. He admitted this earlier, but having seen him play, he's someone that can be very good on the defensive end once his energy level picks up. Had some pretty good instincts defensively and tried to put himself in the right spots most of the time. Looked better than I thought for someone that hasn't played serious ball in several months."
lakers,3cqjhy,Citizen_of_Atlantis,16,Fri Jul 10 00:01:39 2015 UTC,"Similar take-aways to yours.    Clarkson is the best player on the floor at the moment. In terms of explosiveness and quickness he looks like a man amongst boys. He's going to be a beast this year Julius still looks dominant even when he's not going all-out. As all the comments from teammates and coaches have said, dude is just a beast/ox and I expect big things from him. Been saying this since last year, I think his ceiling is Charles Barkley but even more versatile; I stand by that. Lance Jr has ups, and he knows it. He seems more confident in himself and his abilities than I thought he'd be. Probably chalk that up to him playing 4 years of college and being older than almost everyone else there. D'Angelo kind of just blended in with everyone else. NOthing really noticeable in that clip except for some bricked shots. I'm sure he'll pick it up in actual SL games Tarik Black looks really good Upshaw just sort of disappeared into the crowd as well, nothing standout.    Obviously this is just a glimpse at part of a scrimmage, there's only so much we can read into this but those are my takeaways based on the clip."
lakers,3cqjhy,raofblow290,4,Fri Jul 10 00:52:11 2015 UTC,"lol it's Nance Jr, not Lance, as someone named Lance I chuckled"
lakers,3cqjhy,ceelogreen5,6,Fri Jul 10 04:24:37 2015 UTC,Damn I never thought of the Charles Barkley comparison but I like it.
lakers,3cqjhy,ardyputra027,5,Fri Jul 10 01:58:53 2015 UTC,Charles barkley is like 2 to 3 inch shorter than randle but got long arms and strong base. I like the comparison but to say randle will be better than a HOFer is just too much
lakers,3cqjhy,thehumangenius23,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:52:26 2015 UTC,"he has the potential to be, with how rounded his game is. he probably won't be the rebounder Barkley was, though."
lakers,3cqjhy,ashishvp,-4,Fri Jul 10 05:35:45 2015 UTC,I hope his ceiling isn't Chuck.  No rings yo! :(
lakers,3cqjhy,xodus112,3,Fri Jul 10 07:01:32 2015 UTC,Um. Charles is one of the best players ever. We should be thrilled if he's as good as Chuck.
lakers,3cqjhy,ashishvp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:19:26 2015 UTC,It was a joke.. >_>
lakers,3cqjhy,tuioop,2,Fri Jul 10 22:59:56 2015 UTC,Definitely not an indicator of chuck's skill as a basketball player....Charles was absolutely nasty and one of the greatest to play this game
lakers,3cqjhy,TheImmenseFence,12,Fri Jul 10 12:29:07 2015 UTC,"I will add to yours, Jordan clarkson looks even more athletic than before, that block and then that dunk out of nowhere.  Tarik was impressing me a lot with his rebounding, had a couple of offensive ones and almost had a few more.  And god damn that Larry Nance put back. Look how high he was off of the ground."
lakers,3cqjhy,lufty574,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:25:55 2015 UTC,He has been talking about his hops a lot in interviews. I didn't really know he was that serious.
lakers,3cqjhy,ceelogreen5,9,Fri Jul 10 05:25:32 2015 UTC,"Nance stood out to me as well. He just plays so hard, and he's so explosive, Byron is going to have to give him minutes."
lakers,3cqjhy,lakerswiz,9,Fri Jul 10 00:48:34 2015 UTC,Julius Randle as a point forward could be pretty awesome.  Hibbert's rebounding #s are going to be low because he's boxing out and Julius is going to snag the ball and bring it up the floor.
lakers,3cqjhy,kr1saw,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:58:23 2015 UTC,Not just Julius. All the other 4 projected starters can put themselves in great position to grab a board and push for a break. Should be fun to watch.
lakers,3cqjhy,avengedteddy,15,Fri Jul 10 14:33:01 2015 UTC,"damn thought nance was a scrub after seeing laker fans' reaction to his pick. he outjumped, out-hussled everybody."
lakers,3cqjhy,raofblow290,3,Fri Jul 10 00:35:03 2015 UTC,"looked like everyone was hustling out there, he didn't out hustle them he outplayed them."
lakers,3cqjhy,avengedteddy,5,Fri Jul 10 04:26:13 2015 UTC,"not really, he ran back to defend faster than everybody during transition. when you do a put-back slam, that means someone didn't man up on you... or couldn't get there fast enough."
lakers,3cqjhy,DuncanDonuts32,10,Fri Jul 10 04:34:31 2015 UTC,"At 1:30 d'angelo had an easy wide open lane to the layup and he stopped for an awkward pull up jumper, and fuck Larry nance was a beast in these 6 minutes."
lakers,3cqjhy,lars5,7,Fri Jul 10 00:29:33 2015 UTC,"wasn't wide open. larry nance was right there, but mad dog is standing in the camera's way."

lakers,3cqjhy,thelakesh0w,0,Fri Jul 10 05:24:54 2015 UTC,Russel taking it easy until he actually signs the contract...
lakers,3cqjhy,JustAGuy993,19,Fri Jul 10 01:48:02 2015 UTC,"Nance, Randle, and Clarkson look great."
lakers,3cqjhy,spudwinkle,18,Thu Jul 9 23:50:03 2015 UTC,Whenever Big Julius gets the ball I giggle with excitement - been waiting a year for him to dominate! I hope we sweep summer league.
lakers,3cqjhy,Anwar_is_on_par,26,Thu Jul 9 23:56:26 2015 UTC,Jordan Clarkson is going to be an All-star very very soon.
lakers,3cqjhy,blueandgoldLA,13,Fri Jul 10 00:07:30 2015 UTC,"It's gonna be hard with all the guards in the West. I think he'll put up all-star numbers soon, but might get shut out."
lakers,3cqjhy,undercoverbrutha,7,Fri Jul 10 02:31:40 2015 UTC,"playing for LA will help a shit ton, especially if he is putting up the numbers."
lakers,3cqjhy,blueandgoldLA,5,Fri Jul 10 03:34:15 2015 UTC,"agreed. but there's still what? Steph, CP3, Harden, Westbrook, Kobe (for a year)? And then there are the guys on the fringes like Dame, Klay, Bledsoe, Conley. And then there are dark horses like Rondo and TP. They're all better than JC at this moment. He's probably gonna have to wait at least 2-3 years."
lakers,3cqjhy,RufusPFunkerdale,5,Fri Jul 10 05:13:23 2015 UTC,"We have the largest fanbase in the league, fuck it lets vote him in even if he doesn't deserve it. Ruffle some feathers."
lakers,3cqjhy,blueandgoldLA,3,Fri Jul 10 07:31:44 2015 UTC,"I'm down for that hahaha. For the record, I love JC's game and thinks he's gonna be great. Just don't think he'd be popular enough for ASG if we don't win."
lakers,3cqjhy,jgaskins34,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:44:24 2015 UTC,But don't forget we can only vote for him as the starter. Coaches are picking bench players and getting him in over the top West guards right now would be a huge challenge.
lakers,3cqjhy,RockyRectum,2,Fri Jul 10 18:53:05 2015 UTC,"Yup, I can see him being All-Star caliber pretty soon (and I will assume that is what ANwar_is_on_par meant), but there's just too much competition for not enough spots"
lakers,3cqjhy,TheImmenseFence,7,Fri Jul 10 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"He reminds me of Westbrook a lot, and if he turns out to be a 6'5"" brodie god help the league"
lakers,3cqjhy,lolxddavid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:29:18 2015 UTC,"I see him as a perennial all star. Not exactly an all star but close to an all star or above average starter. If his shooting can continue to improve, no doubt then."
lakers,3cqjhy,avengedteddy,12,Fri Jul 10 02:59:46 2015 UTC,"nance outshined all the rookies out there. that boy is hustling. Clarkson most athletic player. And randle lost 5% body fat as it looks like. Great video. unfortunately we didn't see any moments from russell, brown, or upshaw."
lakers,3cqjhy,TheImmenseFence,5,Fri Jul 10 00:30:02 2015 UTC,"That clarkson dunk came out of nowhere, one second hustling next second somehow slamming it down"
lakers,3cqjhy,_3rd,12,Fri Jul 10 01:32:33 2015 UTC,"nice block from Clarkson @ 3:11  nice putback dunk from Nance @ 3:42 & 4:30, but Randle's got to box him out lol  Clarkson looks great! Nice dunk @ 5:45  Randle highlights we saw earlier today, but good to see them in context of game  Was hoping to see more from Russell, but we'll get a much better look on Fri."
lakers,3cqjhy,joshuacrook,9,Thu Jul 9 23:51:26 2015 UTC,Larry nance jr looks solid. i can see a lot of put backs from him
lakers,3cqjhy,SlipClutch,10,Fri Jul 10 00:02:35 2015 UTC,LARRY NANCE THO
lakers,3cqjhy,UpnUpvote,10,Fri Jul 10 01:12:45 2015 UTC,Is it Friday yet?
lakers,3cqjhy,zzyyxxqq,3,Thu Jul 9 23:45:19 2015 UTC,Yes

lakers,3cqjhy,arkansastraffic,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:18:04 2015 UTC,"Yessir. Byron Scott will whip him into shape, bank on it."
lakers,3cqjhy,KobeBasedGod24,8,Fri Jul 10 15:29:57 2015 UTC,I'm not the only one seeing a lot of Odom in Randle right now am I?
lakers,3cqjhy,undercoverbrutha,5,Fri Jul 10 01:32:48 2015 UTC,I see it too. Lefty big man with ball handling skills (and hopefully passing too)
lakers,3cqjhy,arkansastraffic,8,Fri Jul 10 01:35:07 2015 UTC,Randle and Clarkson are looking good from what I saw. But the guy that stood out was Larry Nance Jr. This dude was jumping out of the gym! His game reminds me a lot of Blake Griffin.
lakers,3cqjhy,ByTheBeardOfBruce,4,Fri Jul 10 00:22:41 2015 UTC,Funny enough that's who he has been compared to
lakers,3cqjhy,arkansastraffic,7,Fri Jul 10 03:34:45 2015 UTC,"Nance looked great, but seeing his game made me realize that his talents would likely be wasted playing the 3 (plus he can't shoot threes).  Problem is that the Lakers are already decently stacked at PF. I'm not going to overreact off of just one scrimmage, but he doesn't look like someone you just let ride pine.  Decisions decisions..."
lakers,3cqjhy,ByTheBeardOfBruce,3,Fri Jul 10 02:03:55 2015 UTC,as long as he can guard 3s and 4s. It doesn't matter to me that he can't shoot. It's even looking like he may be able to guard 2s
lakers,3cqjhy,InfinityPoolBoy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:07:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah he definitely looks quick and versatile enough to defend the 3. I guess a bench with Lou Williams, Nick Young, and Brandon Bass (three ball stoppers) won't need much shooting from him. He'll grab their misses and put it back with authority!"
lakers,3cqjhy,iNteL-_-,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:13:19 2015 UTC,"next to randle, i'll probably trust nance to guard the lebrons and the durants of the league"
lakers,3cqjhy,avengedteddy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:20:35 2015 UTC,He has a decent 3 ball. He shot like 35% in college from behind the arc. As his shot gets better he will be a great 3 or stretch 4.
lakers,3cqjhy,sharkytowers76,12,Fri Jul 10 06:30:58 2015 UTC,Russell and Upshaw didn't look great. Hope they play well tomorrow!
lakers,3cqjhy,gotnba,11,Fri Jul 10 00:24:18 2015 UTC,they need some conditioning
lakers,3cqjhy,TheImmenseFence,7,Fri Jul 10 00:35:35 2015 UTC,"In Russell's case he might be deferring to Clarkson a lot.  I'd try and not come in too ""hot"" on my peers if I were the highly touted pick.  Can't wait to watch tomorrow."
lakers,3cqjhy,ByTheBeardOfBruce,4,Fri Jul 10 01:50:28 2015 UTC,"i disagree man I hope he doesen't give a crap and tries to dominate. I hope he tries to demolish everyon like how Kobe/Westbrook would. Most people would try to defer, however, I hope he isn't like most people."
lakers,3cqjhy,RonaldCharles,3,Fri Jul 10 03:45:21 2015 UTC,"Upshaw hasn't played much basketball in a while, he did look like he was dragging his body around with him out there. If he can bulk up get fit he will be great"
lakers,3cqjhy,NicDwolfwood,6,Fri Jul 10 01:31:25 2015 UTC,that rebound-pass nance did really shows off his BBQ-IQ
lakers,3cqjhy,Riles26,5,Fri Jul 10 00:46:03 2015 UTC,guy knows his way around a bbq
lakers,3cqjhy,yatrickmith,5,Fri Jul 10 01:40:25 2015 UTC,"Nance looks good. Randle is looking good. Clarkson looks excellent. Black looks good also Russell, eh they didnt really show too much of him, just the one shot and a few passes.   Hoping for good things tomorrow. very excited to see this young group play"
lakers,3cqjhy,PantslessMan,5,Fri Jul 10 01:30:57 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, being an avid Mountain West follower (Boise State being my university) I love seeing Nance Jr. do his thing. I watched him for four years and knew he was underrated. Props to our F/o for finding another guy that could potentially pan out like JC. Go Lakers"
lakers,3cqjhy,kenn4000,4,Fri Jul 10 05:28:36 2015 UTC,"Impressed with Larry Nance Jr. Has hops, hustle, and athleticism."
lakers,3cqjhy,ceelogreen5,4,Fri Jul 10 06:02:37 2015 UTC,Nance hype! Holy cow
lakers,3cqjhy,kenn4000,4,Fri Jul 10 01:18:20 2015 UTC,i was hoping that will davis (10) would be playing the 3 like the team needs instead of the 4 like he did at uci. would love to be able to say that i got dunked on by a laker but he was getting killed by julius in the 4 spot
lakers,3cqjhy,ceelogreen5,2,Fri Jul 10 01:26:48 2015 UTC,"That's sick man! Did you go to UCI, or how did you end up ballin' with him?"
lakers,3cqjhy,lolxddavid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:03:02 2015 UTC,"yeah i was at uci and play at the arc most days. played against him a couple times and he never tries very hard so that it stays interesting most games. hes a real cool guy, lets the small dudes toss him lobs in the pick up games when possible."
lakers,3cqjhy,clippjoint,2,Fri Jul 10 03:12:55 2015 UTC,That's cool. You guys broke my heart in the Big West tourney. I'm a UCSB grad
lakers,3cqjhy,BionicSix,3,Fri Jul 10 03:43:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, I was impressed by Nance. Randle looks massive. His upper body is bigger than Upshaw and Black.    Russell needs to condition more. He looked out of breath in the clips. Also the defense is lazy and transition defense isn't all that good."
lakers,3cqjhy,remanz,4,Fri Jul 10 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"The new Larry Legend is born, he looks good out there. :D"
lakers,3cqjhy,BayStyles,3,Fri Jul 10 03:57:24 2015 UTC,"Holy smokes - Nance Jr is killing it.  Upshaw looks gassed and 2 steps behind.  Randle, Clarkson look great, nothing of note from Russell or Brown."
lakers,3cqjhy,canetrain,4,Fri Jul 10 04:19:00 2015 UTC,Nance can really jump.
lakers,3cqjhy,ByTheBeardOfBruce,4,Fri Jul 10 06:39:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not surprised at all that D'Lo, Upshaw and some others look tired and didn't really stand out. We all know from last year how B Scott works the hell out of you IMMEDIATELY to get your conditioning on point. Wouldn't be surprised if this scrimmage was after some intense endurance training."
lakers,3cqjhy,KingNg,3,Fri Jul 10 06:54:01 2015 UTC,Nance be ballin'
lakers,3cqjhy,dalas3322,3,Fri Jul 10 09:12:03 2015 UTC,"remember last year when we were nervous when randle would rebound and push the ball? seems like he really improved his ball handling, much more in control"
lakers,3cqjhy,dkstariob,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:14:22 2015 UTC,He can handle the ball based off his highschool/college highlights.
lakers,3cqjhy,Zacrem,3,Fri Jul 10 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"clarkson and randle were killing it.  i wish they could show some russell highlights, didn't seem he was involved much.  thanks for posting this btw"
lakers,3cqjhy,ashishvp,3,Fri Jul 10 02:10:28 2015 UTC,Anyone notice Clarkson pushing off Upshaw at around 3:24-3:25. This guy plays with an edge and a huge chip on his shoulder which is great.
lakers,3cqjhy,kissmyash24,3,Fri Jul 10 02:40:32 2015 UTC,Nance Jr is a baller!
lakers,3cqjhy,xSora08,3,Fri Jul 10 06:32:16 2015 UTC,Mmmmmm JC shot straight over Upshaw. That does not bode well for his NBA blocking ability :/. I'm sure he'll work it out as the summer goes on tho.  Meanwhile. NANCE JR. Holy shit he's got some moves!
lakers,3cqjhy,TheRealMindGamez,2,Fri Jul 10 06:58:07 2015 UTC,Clarkson is looking great. coming along very nicely. season is looking very exciting!
lakers,3cqjhy,droid0mega,2,Fri Jul 10 01:38:43 2015 UTC,damn upshaw was gassed and had no legs lmao. looked like me trying to defend the paint and rebound during that one part of the video!
lakers,3cqjhy,alexxdim94,2,Fri Jul 10 05:37:59 2015 UTC,"Dat dunk by Clarkson, reminds me of exactly how Kobe used to dunk it."
lakers,3cqjhy,FunGoodHappyJoy,2,Fri Jul 10 08:12:05 2015 UTC,"Clarkson, Nance and Randle stood out the most.  Russell might have some adjusting to do in the NBA. For a PG he looks really slow-footed. Still too early to say what kind of impact he'll have in actual games."
lakers,3cqjhy,GabrielRodriguez115,2,Fri Jul 10 10:57:43 2015 UTC,Anyone notice Clarkson with the Jamal Crawford crossover?
lakers,3cqjhy,Jpsla,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:37:07 2015 UTC,"These guys look great, but D'angelo Russell looked kind of in cruise mode, I bet he'll step it up tomorrow."
lakers,3cqjhy,hollyw00dhustle,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:52:04 2015 UTC,"1:11 mark - I hope we see this often during the season. However, I really don't like seeing Randle taking the ball down court. That was something that kind of irked me during last year's preseason games as well. Also, I know this is just a scrimmage with new teammates, but it looked pretty unorganized and scrappy out there.   5:38 mark is also a good one."
lakers,3cr5lx,lancestephensoniskil,94,Fri Jul 10 02:50:10 2015 UTC,you have lin fans.
lakers,3cr5lx,ElementShield,60,Fri Jul 10 02:52:51 2015 UTC,Our condolences

lakers,3cr5lx,shootmans,22,Fri Jul 10 04:34:26 2015 UTC,Maybe we would wish them upon those tiny green /r/bostonceltics
lakers,3cr5lx,Schneeky,4,Fri Jul 10 05:18:00 2015 UTC,LOL DUDE that is what I was hoping for!
lakers,3cr5lx,aveydey,29,Fri Jul 10 08:43:15 2015 UTC,"Prepare for your coach to be accused of being a racist. He's a good player and an even better dude, but he causes problems in the organization due to his ridiculous fan base. Good luck. He's your problem now."
lakers,3cr5lx,TheRealMelvinGibson,6,Fri Jul 10 03:27:59 2015 UTC,Even Mchale got called a racist when Lin was in Houston. These Lin Only Fans are most likely high school dropouts.
lakers,3cr5lx,Schneeky,13,Fri Jul 10 04:35:27 2015 UTC,"The irony in their racism is what gets me. I mean I get it. He's Asian, you're Asian, but that doesn't make it you and your boy Lin against the world. He's a good player. But there are lots of good players who deserve the minutes just as much as him if not more."
lakers,3cr5lx,TheRealMelvinGibson,8,Fri Jul 10 04:57:06 2015 UTC,"It goes way beyond ""he's Asian, you're Asian"" though. You have a ton of Asian-American basketball fans. We all grew up shooting hoops and loving basketball, but we never had the luxury of having any Asian pro sports role models, let alone Asian basketball players (unless you were into Tennis -- Michael Chang was dope). All of a sudden Lin emerges out of nowhere. He's not half-Asian. He's not some crazy Chinese government-bred sports experiment import. He's a straight up Asian-American baller, like all of us wanted to be when we were kids, and the dude can play. It's quite a treat. Hard not to be an unreasonable fan when he's the only player with a similar cultural upbringing.  That said, I'm a diehard Laker fan before anything, and while he was a serviceable guard, I'm glad to see him go to make room for the young talent."
lakers,3cr5lx,superbadsoul,3,Fri Jul 10 11:51:43 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from and there's nothing wrong with being a fan of Lin, but the people we're talking about are guys who would say 'Lin could be the next MJ with enough touches and minutes'. They even talked about how Lin can finally get minutes when Scott left following the pass of I think his mother."
lakers,3cr5lx,TuneHD,2,Fri Jul 10 14:28:59 2015 UTC,One thing is for sure... those type of Lin fans are not american.
lakers,3cr5lx,avengedteddy,3,Fri Jul 10 14:32:50 2015 UTC,They're usually Asian-American or just Asian
lakers,3cr5lx,TuneHD,3,Fri Jul 10 14:36:33 2015 UTC,you sure they are asian-american?
lakers,3cr5lx,avengedteddy,2,Fri Jul 10 14:43:47 2015 UTC,Yes...

lakers,3cr5lx,FuckTheClippers,4,Fri Jul 10 03:34:42 2015 UTC,"Haha I just went to check it out, they fully deserve it and they'll realize how much it'll suck as the season goes on. It became pretty hard to visit this sub last season after certain games"
lakers,3cr5lx,Mantis-Toboggin,7,Fri Jul 10 03:47:09 2015 UTC,They'll come crawling here in November after two weeks complaining about them. I can't wait to rub shit across their faces
lakers,3cr5lx,FuckTheClippers,3,Fri Jul 10 03:49:43 2015 UTC,Yeah I wonder when will they finally leave this sub. Maybe when he changes teams again
lakers,3cr5lx,howdoesilogin,3,Fri Jul 10 06:51:29 2015 UTC,I got downvoted so hard last year. I  almost wanted to Lin to do bad so they would just shut up
lakers,3cr5lx,Scabandiri,10,Fri Jul 10 04:17:35 2015 UTC,"They're delusional as fuck. Look at what this one said in your sub.   There are about 3-4 passionate Lin only haters spamming everything about these Lin only fans. So it's more like 3-4 guys talking about how crazy women are and that you should not stick your dick into crazy, while being virgin neckbeards.   LOL"
lakers,3cr5lx,Cheese234,7,Fri Jul 10 04:44:02 2015 UTC,"Hahah I'm so sorry man. I'm so glad they're gone though. You're going to have a ton of fans who think that Lin is on the verge of stardom & it's about to be Linsanity 2.0 all over again.   It sucks.   That being said, he actually is a good point guard. There were many instances that Byron benched Lin while we were winning during our tank last season. He'll be a very valuable PG to run the PNR with, that's what he thrives at."
lakers,3cr5lx,badguymatt,5,Fri Jul 10 03:04:01 2015 UTC,Lin signing confirmed.  Good luck. They mean well.
lakers,3cr5lx,readem_n_weep,2,Fri Jul 10 03:25:32 2015 UTC,I just went to it I don't see Lin anywhere.
lakers,3cr5lx,mike1883,2,Fri Jul 10 05:03:54 2015 UTC,Sorry I found the official one. Damn that is crazy.
lakers,3cr5lx,mike1883,2,Fri Jul 10 05:06:00 2015 UTC,It appears your subreddit has gone LINSANE! Did you see that kemba walker penguin story? Everyone has clearly lost their mind over there! Hahaha
lakers,3cr5lx,kawikaboy12,2,Fri Jul 10 07:28:55 2015 UTC,It's a weird phenomenon. You start with the rabid lin fans. This leads to the lin fan haters. In between the two you have the trolls. Pretty soon you won't have a rational opinion on the guy.   Sorry man. At least he signed for 4 mill instead of what we signed him for.
lakers,3cr5lx,dendenmoooshi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:41:07 2015 UTC,Hey man we signed him for a free Larry Nance Jr.
lakers,3cr5lx,aveydey,4,Fri Jul 10 16:20:26 2015 UTC,"Just checked out the Hornets subreddit. Holy crap, they are relentless. First two page is almost all about Lin."
lakers,3cr5lx,spoolx,5,Fri Jul 10 05:34:50 2015 UTC,"Lin fans tend to post a shit load of articles about Lin even as the season progresses. In addition, they will continue to try and argue that Lin should be the starting point. He's a good backup but Lin fans will continually give arguments for Lin struggling if he doesn't play too well."
lakers,3cr5lx,weyerwall,6,Fri Jul 10 03:01:15 2015 UTC,"I mean, to be fair, it's very possible that Lin would be better than Kemba, or at least good alongside him a la Mo Williams last season.   I didn't realise what a following this dude apparently has, although, I've been pretty happy about the signing. I guess exposure is pretty nice, too."
lakers,3cr5lx,weyerwall,4,Fri Jul 10 03:05:23 2015 UTC,"Lin is a good backup and that's all. He needs to have the ball a lot in order to have one of his good games. With the second unit he would have a lot of control over the ball to score and help the other players in the second unit score. However, I don't think he would do too well alongside Kemba because isn't he usually the primary ball handler? Then, there's also the fact that he is really inconsistent. I hope he does good next year as your back up though.  Edit: words"
lakers,3cr5lx,gotnba,4,Fri Jul 10 03:12:04 2015 UTC,"Man I'm not a lin fan but to say he is a good backup and that's all is underestimating his ability. He isn't amazing and I'm not delusional but Kemba is a very average point guard shoots around 40% and isn't great at passing. As someone that watches basketball, he can definitley be a starting point guard and Clifford is a big fan of how Lin plays."
lakers,3cr5lx,howdoesilogin,3,Fri Jul 10 03:54:47 2015 UTC,"Can you tell me what are you basing this on? He was bad on the rockets, he was bad on the lakers and he was bad on the knicks (except for a 1month period 3 years ago). He definetly cant be a starting point guard, he never was one"
lakers,3cr5lx,Scarlatina,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:37:30 2015 UTC,"I'm a Knicks fan. Lin was still pretty decent after we fired D'Antoni and hired Woodson. There's a reason our front office wanted him back so badly that they foolishly said, ""We'll match any offer up to a billion dollars.""  How was Lin bad on the Rockets? Lin had one of the lowest usage rate per minute on the team and still averaged 13/4/3 on 28 minutes a game... with a per36 of 16/5/3. That's pretty solid numbers."
lakers,3cr5lx,howdoesilogin,3,Fri Jul 10 06:52:01 2015 UTC,"he averaged 12.5/4.1/2.6 in 29.1mpg   Sure they're solid, thats why every analist says he could be a very good sub. But the thing with per36 is it does not translate 1:1 into increased playing time (you wont get your per 36 stats playing 36mpg, just like you wont get your per 48 stats playing 48mpg). Those are just a projection, I could find you guys with Lebron-like numbers per36, its a stat thats supposed to say which reserve might deserve more playing time. Not who is and who isnt a starter.  Mo Williams posted 17.5/2.8/7.7 per36 last year"
lakers,3cr5lx,Scarlatina,0,Fri Jul 10 07:12:53 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying Lin wasn't bad on the Rockets or the Knicks like you claimed, this season with the Lakers was the only one I've considered to be bad. Even then, Lin re-grouped after ASB and started to look like his old self, but apparently PnR plays do not sit well with Scott."
lakers,3cr5lx,howdoesilogin,2,Fri Jul 10 07:31:22 2015 UTC,"Then why did he go to an eastern conference lottery team to be a reserve pg for what is close to minimum salary (only 2 people will be payed less for the hornets this season)?  Sure we can disagree on how good he was, but the fact remains, he didnt have any offers in free agency for some reason and ended in Charlotte getting less than guys like Brian Roberts and Jeremy Lamb."
lakers,3cr5lx,Scarlatina,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:48:48 2015 UTC,"There could be a multitude of reasons, but who knows what happened for sure. Those same ""analysts"" and reporters claimed that Lin's market value was closer to $4-5 million, and that's why the Mavs had to do a sign-and-trade with the Lakers. Maybe after the whole DeAndre Jordan situation the Mavs weren't interested anymore/ It doesn't seem like they had anything to offer the Lakers. So maybe Lin held out for the Mavs too long, and it didn't work out in the end.  Lin himself has said multiple times this offseason that he doesn't care about money (probably because he just came off a pretty hefty contract). Instead, Lin was more concerned about finding the ""right fit"" and a team that would allow him to play his style of ball (aka PnR-heavy)."
lakers,3cr5lx,VernonMaxwell,0,Fri Jul 10 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"he was bad on the knicks??  the kid had zero real nba true game time experience, and got them into the playoffs because of his run.  I don't care who you are, one just doesn't do what he did and it be a fluke.  He needed and needs work, and did what he could with the little time he'd been there.  And towards the end of that season, he had some injury.    I'm not saying he could fit any system, and most likely, not many systems, but with the right one and right coach, he could do well.  I don't know anything about charlotte or their coach, but I have no idea if that will fit him.    But at least be honest and objective.     He was bad on the rockets,    McHale is a horrible coach to for PGs.  Both Dragic and Loury flourished after leaving him.  Aaron Brooks did much better after leaving him. Lin went downhill after getting to work with him.    And then he got to play in a new system, with a shit coach, which later went to tank.  Who was good on your team this past season??  Not saying they couldn't be good, but y'all were in tank mode."
lakers,3cr5lx,howdoesilogin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:46:13 2015 UTC,I'm really tired of arguing this. Will you agree with me he's not starter material if he doesnt do well this year? Or will it be the coaches fault again for the third time in as many years?
lakers,3cr5lx,VernonMaxwell,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"I wasn't arguing, I was just replying to a comment you made that I didn't think was objective.   Will you agree with me he's not starter material if he doesnt do well this year?   why would I?  If he's on a shit team with a bad coach/system, why would I agree he's not starter  material?   Look at David Lee, went from All-Star to bench, to being traded because he didn't fit the system.  This happens a lot, and for some players, they just need to be in the right place.   I don't know anything about this system/coach, so who knows.  If he's a shitty coach and they just have a shitty ass system, and Lin doesn't do well, you're honestly going to tell me that it's all on Lin???"
lakers,3cr5lx,howdoesilogin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"Honestly I dont know, just like I dont know with Lee. Point is i have three years worth of data of Lin playing for three different franchises and 4 different coaches against just one 30 game stretch of him playing great for the Knicks. that makes me think its more on him than those coaches. Sure if he brings it back this year and plays well I'll chuck it up to the incompetence of Scott & co. But if he doesnt? lets just say theres a limit to coincidences."
lakers,3cr5lx,VernonMaxwell,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"so you're looking at his Houston years with a coach that is well known for not utilizing PGs well, and then this past season with a tanking system/season??  I mean, he did great with Dantoni, and decent-good with woodson in that system.  Did meh with a bad coach, meaning mchale.  I can't stand McHale as a coach, even now.  I think he's way overrated, although he has improved.    And then you got Byron.  You just can't look at stats as in black and white.  You also have to give it the eye test.  And I'm not saying lin is an all-star, but he needs to right system.     lets just say theres a limit to coincidences.   meh, look at Boogie.  Dude is a baller and look how Malone changed him.  And Lin is no where near that level.  I'm telling you, some players need the right system.  The problem with Lin is that he's not good enough to have a system built around him, that's just not gonna happen.    A guy like CP3 can go anywhere and they'll adapt to him.    I tell you what, if he ever gets a chance with Pop, or Carlisle, or Dantoni (if he gets hired), and prob a few other coaches out there.... and he does shitty, then I'll concede and say he just doesn't have what it takes."
lakers,3cr5lx,VernonMaxwell,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"just curious, who all was consistent on your team last year?  and what does consistent mean to you?  does that mean avg around the same amount of assists? points?"
lakers,3cr5lx,manolo88,3,Fri Jul 10 17:29:32 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind Lin as a backup PG, but when the Lin fans came in this subreddit I started disliking Lin more and more.

I'm not the biggest Byron fan in the world but I was seriously wondering if they were watching the same game I was."

She also asked her son what the shot clock was, and another one asked if the red 24 (Shot Clock) was for Kobe.         I swear I'm not making this up, that's how they are."

lakers,3cr5lx,GabrielRodriguez115,3,Fri Jul 10 04:31:40 2015 UTC,"Really big Lin fan here. It's kind of obvious why we like him so much, he is an Asian American basketball player in a league where there were 9 players (now 11) in the league. The asian community was always there we were just quiet and rooted for Kobe, we were there with Yao ming, and now Lin trust me, we mean well we just love finally having some representation in media we don't get a lot of it.

lakers,3cvpd2,SwaggyB23,14,Sat Jul 11 04:13:13 2015 UTC,Crazy how different the NBA would be if the trade happened...  Houston wouldn't have enough assets to make the James Harden trade. Dragic would've ended up in New Orleans and Eric Bledose would still be a Clipper so the Suns probably wouldn't be that great. Dwight probably would've stayed in LA and with Houston not having enough assets to get James Harden so Houston probably wouldn't be that good. Steve Nash would've went to Toronto instead of the Lakers which means no Lowry and no playoffs. Also the Hornets would be a much better team so they probably wouldn't of gotten the 1st pick so no Anthony Davis there. With cp3 maybe Kobe would've had less minutes which could've prevented the achillies injury and maybe the Lakers could've won a championship..... or 3

He played more of the two at Louisville but he became a better point gaurd by his senior year. He's not super athletic for his size but he has a great handle and is lightning quick.

But he would be a great guy off the bench, or a starter if he is played with a more level headed ball handler."

lakers,3cpk2z,happyadrian,14,Thu Jul 9 20:47:53 2015 UTC,"Damn.  He looks like he's in great shape.  Any chance he'd return to the NBA and/or Lakers, or am I being blinded by awful competition at the Drew League?"

On a more serious note, I really hope he talks to Upshaw."
lakers,3cpk2z,TuneHD,3,Thu Jul 9 21:17:32 2015 UTC,He'd be an enforcer on our bench even if he's just a coach in a suit. Players would still fear retaliation.

lakers,3csxby,BABYPUBESS,7,Fri Jul 10 14:47:14 2015 UTC,Once we pull off the the first round upset as the 8th seed this year.
lakers,3csxby,DUBBZZ,0,Fri Jul 10 19:44:52 2015 UTC,"I think we have a chance to sneak into the playoffs this year, which would be nice so our young guys get some playoff experience. Depending on how our rooks look this year i can see the Lakers at least having a chance to compete in 2016. Most realistic will be 2017 season though."
lakers,3csxby,Maniac_24,4,Fri Jul 10 15:04:21 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of Lakers fans are forgetting that we aren't the only non playoff team in the west to improve this offseason. Right now we've tentatively got something like this for playoff seedings; 1. Spurs 2. Thunder 3. Warriors 4. Rockets 5. Grizzlies 6. Clippers 7. Pelican. After that the 8th seed could be between a few teams, but I don't see how the Lakers would manage to leap frog the Suns, Jazz, and Mavericks. I know the Mavs lost DJ, but they brought in ZaZa who's a hard working scrappy center, and if Wes and Parsons are healthy I can't see us finishing ahead of them this season. Jazz were looking great at the end of last season and Gobert, Exum, and Hayward will have only improved."
lakers,3csxby,justgivingsomeadvice,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"You've overrating the Mavs I think. They're an awful defensive team without Chandler and Zaza doesn't help. Matthew is great but he'll be recovering from an Achilles injury, who knows how well that goes?   I agree the Jazz look really good, I expect them to take #8. The Kings & Suns are dark horses as well; everything has to go right for the Kings, and the Suns have the talent (I'm not convinced in their roster to win more than 35 though)"
lakers,3csxby,TuneHD,0,Fri Jul 10 22:17:46 2015 UTC,You're forgetting injuries. OKC went from being a top 2 seed lock to missing the playoffs entirely.
lakers,3csxby,vinjhup,5,Fri Jul 10 16:14:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not forgetting injuries. But injuries happen to every team, so we shouldn't use that to the Lakers advantage in predicting where they'll finish. Randle broke his leg last season, what if that happens again? Kobe didn't play for half the season, what if that happens?"
lakers,3csxby,TuneHD,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:17:05 2015 UTC,"Knowing Kobe, I don't think he'd even allow that to happen. But I see your point. TBH if we don't tank, I'll call this season a win no matter what"
lakers,3csxby,tjay17,0,Fri Jul 10 19:44:04 2015 UTC,"Except that's not what I'm saying. You're trying to place those teams as if they're a 100% lock. We won't know how every team will perform next season, who will get injured, and who might erupt or suck. Did you have the Warriors going from middle of the pack, first round exits to the Clippers to being a historical team that wins the chip? Did you predict KD would go down and eliminate OKC from the playoffs? Sure, in a perfect world, the Lakers won't make the playoffs without the team overachieving. Reality is the Lakers still have a shot at 8th seed given multiple circumstances."
lakers,3csxby,showtimeb,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:45:57 2015 UTC,"It all depends how fast Randle, Russell and Clarkson develop. If Russell is the next Messiah for LA and is the superstar we hope he can become, then I peg next year as a legitimate contending year since we can go and sign a max player (Durant, etc) to help the cause."
lakers,3csxby,kangaroo_tacos,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:05:26 2015 UTC,Realistically I don't see us in a Finals until 2020. We can probably be in the playoffs in another year or two.
lakers,3csxby,TuneHD,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:09:37 2015 UTC,3 years ...absolute best case 2  But we need to grow as a team and see what we can do with all space from Kobe. If this draft class plus Randle can really pull it together we could be a FA destination potentially as well.

Let us all hope for the best in the future."

lakers,3crbzs,ErectionQuest,2,Fri Jul 10 08:07:06 2015 UTC,"When the dust settled from the Aldridge sweepstakes, whatever were the best decisions to make were made. The main goal was to get quality pieces not to have a dramatic makeover in a year, but to put together a team that would be better than the year before to allure prominent free agents in the future. Mitch did that. If health, chemistry, and many other factors all click, we're on the right path to returning to relevance. Mitch did his part, its now up to the coaching+training staff and the players to execute so he has a better pitch to make next offseason.   Lets hope it all works out! In Mitch we Trust :)"

He's going to bring some much needed attention back to our team because he's such an entertaining player to watch. This was the move the Lakers needed to make to ensure everyone that we're done ""tanking"" and we're on our way back up."
lakers,3cpw5p,Buckelroo,2,Thu Jul 9 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"We will have Lou Will, Kobe and Swaggy P showing Clarkson, D'angelo and Anthony Brown their moves in practice, teaching them how to score in every way imaginable. Just need someone to teach defense!"
lakers,3cpw5p,Buckelroo,13,Thu Jul 9 20:52:16 2015 UTC,Get Meta World Peace a coaching spot and call it a day!
lakers,3cpw5p,dissphemism,5,Thu Jul 9 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"I still don't know about this.. On their past 5 seasons, Lou is a less efficient, guard version of Nick Young.  That's counting in Young's injury-riddled '15 season where he missed 40 games, and with Lou playing on much better teams the past 5 seasons, on a weak conference."
lakers,3cpw5p,dissphemism,3,Thu Jul 9 23:28:41 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of Nick and Lou comparisons thrown around, but I think it's just because they are offensive players who like the ball in their hand.   One of the things that really bothered me about Nick last year is he wasn't doing as many catch and shoots (probably because we had no point guard, don't forget K Butter was dishing dimes left and right 2 years ago) and was trying to cook every defender off the dribble then he'd pull up and miss. IMO it will be of great help to have Lou Will handling the ball a lot for the 2nd unit so Nick can pick his spots, catch and shoot, which is his bread and butter as much as he likes to style on fools with his mediocre dribbling. If we are planning to run Lou and Swaggy as our 2nd unit, we will NEED a point guard who just wants to dish and two bigs who just want to clean glass, because there won't be many extra shots to go around. And this is not a bad thing! If you watched last year, we desperately needed scoring, we just couldn't compete because we couldn't score enough. Our defense needs a ton of work but this is the Lou Williams signing comments, so we will discuss that at a later date."
lakers,3cpw5p,AaronOG,2,Thu Jul 9 23:47:37 2015 UTC,"I'd say the comparisons are very much valid. They have similar roles, similar (bad) tendencies, and skill sets, and Lou is still a less efficient player than Young, even when playing on better teams. That says a lot to me.  And if we exclude Young's uncharacteristic '15 season, that gap just grows even wider."
lakers,3cpw5p,dalas3322,7,Fri Jul 10 00:02:42 2015 UTC,Now I'm just mashing F5 for Hibbert then I can relax

lakers,3coovt,Shambaree,42,Thu Jul 9 15:26:04 2015 UTC,I'm just waiting to get the official notification. With the slight salary cap increase it looks like we're just going to send a second round pick (year tbd) and cash. Meaning we get to keep our guys and hopefully sign Upshaw if he performs well tomorrow. Sounds like we've got a decent roster for next year.

lakers,3coovt,Kbmakaveli,17,Fri Jul 10 17:26:19 2015 UTC,"Considering Dallas and Portland will be weaker this year, LA has a chance to make the playoffs while developing their youngins."
lakers,3coovt,tjay17,26,Thu Jul 9 15:37:40 2015 UTC,"As long as we look competitive, stay injury free (relatively), and our rookies show their skills, we'll be on our way back to being an attractive spot for free agents."
lakers,3coovt,Buckelroo,4,Thu Jul 9 15:43:19 2015 UTC,"I thought about that when DJ went back. If the Mavs decide to blow things up, that's one less team like you said.. definitely interesting."
lakers,3coovt,MikeMcNorv,9,Thu Jul 9 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"No.  We don't.  OKC, Utah, Phoenix, and New Orleans are stronger this year."
lakers,3coovt,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:36:39 2015 UTC,"Pels made the playoffs last year. The spots from last year that will be up for grabs are the Mavs and Blazers. One of those goes to OKC. The other is up for grabs between Suns, Jazz, Lakers and Wolves.  Edit: I'm not so sure the Suns are stronger this year."
lakers,3coovt,k4f123,-5,Fri Jul 10 12:17:29 2015 UTC,I don't agree. They all have huge question marks.
lakers,3coovt,tjay17,5,Thu Jul 9 17:41:26 2015 UTC,"OKC I could see - it all hinges on Durant, but what are Utah, Phoenix, and New Orleans' question marks?  Those teams are returning almost all of their key players.  Phoenix even picked up Chandler."

I can see the Thunder, Warriors, Spurs, Grizzlies, Clippers, Rockets, and Pelicans all winning 50+ (I'm optimistic about the Pelicans because Anthony Davis). That 8th seed is gonna be an absolute crap shoot, and the Lakers outplaying the Jazz and Kinga (imo strongest contenders for that spot) is definitely possible.   God the playoffs would be amazing, please NBA gods!"

lakers,3coovt,MiNdHaBiTs,6,Thu Jul 9 17:04:36 2015 UTC,The Jazz and Suns were like 17 wins better than us and are returning their cores - we would have to be 20 wins better to even be in a fight with them.  We're battling for #11.

lakers,3coovt,ILikeChocolateMilkk,14,Thu Jul 9 16:38:12 2015 UTC,All the Swaggy hate I read in this sub is annoying. He had an off year that started off with an injury. The year before that he was great for what we needed him for.   I'm all for a Swaggy/Lou bench mob.

lakers,3coovt,supremesamurai,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:23:45 2015 UTC,I agree. Swaggy can still shoot the ball and be the 6th man. Lou and Swaggy are both inconsistent. But getting 2 inconsistent 6th man type players can increase consistency of the bench.
lakers,3coovt,avengedteddy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:53:23 2015 UTC,Well he's a streaky shooter and he's pretty immature. I'm not really a fan of the guy.

Idk just my opinion"
lakers,3coovt,machiavellius,7,Thu Jul 9 16:40:30 2015 UTC,He's missed a total of 11 games the last 3 seasons so...
lakers,3coovt,pacerpower,3,Thu Jul 9 16:46:32 2015 UTC,"He never gets injured and works his tail off.  If you feel this way about him, he will win you over.  People judge a dude because of some shitty performances without keeping his entire career in mind.  This guy basically has a rule named after him (or associated with him) those types of guys are rare."
lakers,3coovt,toocoofoschool,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:54:20 2015 UTC,"It's a very good low risk move. Hibbert has an elite NBA skill (interior defense/rim protection) which could really help our terrible defense from last year. Worst case he is only helpful against certain teams/ lineups, but we don't have to hold on to him if we don't want to after this year. If he does bounce back and looks closer to his old self then we own his bird rights which is very important."
lakers,3coovt,readem_n_weep,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:48:15 2015 UTC,Solid defense. We don't need points from him. This is good.
lakers,3coovt,Sletts,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:53:02 2015 UTC,He gives us the interior presence that we really need for people like Russell and Randle and Clarkson to properly develop. He makes it a more complete team that will make it easier for them to find their rhythm in the NBA.
lakers,3coovt,supremesamurai,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:04:44 2015 UTC,"Nonsense. This was a good move by Mitch. Hibbert's skill fits perfect for what we need him for. He doesn't have to be the 3rd scoring option, just needs to protect the paint, which stats show, that he is above average."
lakers,3coovt,iAMtHESushighost,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:08:53 2015 UTC,"One of the things he doesn't do is get injured, the way he plays, not full force jumping for a block or rebound, and falling down a lot is him preserving his knees (falling down rather than awkwardly trying to keep your balance, putting less strain on your knees) he takes really good care of his body."
lakers,3coovt,StealthRUs,0,Fri Jul 10 05:31:18 2015 UTC,I'd rather just give his minutes to Upshaw and Black.

lakers,3cpyes,Ray3142,4,Thu Jul 9 21:20:51 2015 UTC,"Just curios, is everything he's done with the team so far unpaid? Or do draft picks not get any money until they sign? When do they get paychecks? I'm just realizing I don't know any of this."
lakers,3cpyes,antantantantantant,4,Thu Jul 9 22:24:04 2015 UTC,"I just read about this, and yes. Unsigned players that play on the SL are well.. unsigned. No money is earned. It's the bit of risk they're taking to showcase themselves to not only NBA scouts, but lots of int'l scouts watching. In case of injury during an SL game, usually the team picks up the medical bill.  Not to worry though, because most 1st rounders, and early 2nd rounders are almost always going to get signed eventually."

lakers,3cpyes,arkansastraffic,2,Thu Jul 9 22:09:42 2015 UTC,"Eric Pincus had a tweet saying signing A Brown to a minimum deal is equivalent to having an open roster spot.   In a later tweet he said that they'll likely wait to sign Russell until after the Hibbert trade so as not to eat into the cap space for Roy, because we have leeway to sign Russell to 120% of what we're allowed."

lakers,3cpl0t,Titanosaurus,10,Fri Jul 10 18:41:07 2015 UTC,"Well the 8 seed is wide open, if the Jazz last year were a fluke it's not unreasonable to think the. Lakers might actually sneak into the playoffs over them, the Suns, and the Kings.   That's a big if though and would require D'Angelo and Julius to start the regular season as positive contributors"
lakers,3cpl0t,justgivingsomeadvice,4,Thu Jul 9 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"It very well may be but I don't think the Jazz are going to fluke; I think they'll be better than us. We may, at the end of the season, really come together well and see good stretches but I just don't want people to grill our youth in case we don't make the playoffs or we go through some losing stretches.  But, ultimately, I think we'll have reactionary shit no matter what, I'm just getting my thoughts out before it gets lost in the shuffle."
lakers,3cpl0t,JesusSama,3,Thu Jul 9 20:28:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can agree with that. I'm dying for some postseason basketball, and unlike the last two years, it's at least reasonable to hope the Lakers can get that 8 seed. Gonna keep them homer glasses on, though yeah the young guys developing is more important than getting swept by the Warriors as the 8th seed"

lakers,3cpl0t,TheImmenseFence,5,Thu Jul 9 20:10:07 2015 UTC,Teams don't usually alternate between the all the starters on the floor vs. all the 2nd unit players on floor. More likely a blend of some starters and bench players based on opposing players on floor/fatigue/foul trouble/off vs. def needs/who has the hot hand/etc.
lakers,3cpl0t,LovlyBunchOCoconuts,2,Thu Jul 9 20:21:39 2015 UTC,"Either they have that rec center basketball connection and, along with Bass, lead the league in bench scoring, or it's a horrible dumpster fire fueled by Laker fan tears. After last season, I'll take that risk though."
lakers,3cpl0t,AaronOG,3,Thu Jul 9 20:26:14 2015 UTC,Larry Nance? You know he got picked higher than Brown.
lakers,3cpl0t,Haiko248,2,Thu Jul 9 20:16:01 2015 UTC,"They would could be interchangable, but I have it in my head that Nance is more a PF. He can play both, I know, but I think they'll both get around the same minutes."
lakers,3cpl0t,AaronOG,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"Functionally, LNJr is more of a glue guy than the 3nD that Brown can provide so this lineup makes more sense. You can probably slot LNJr as a combo F able to play/defend both SF and PF"

lakers,3cpl0t,TweetsInCommentsBot,14,Thu Jul 9 20:29:05 2015 UTC,"Basketball fans are so ingrained on the idea of set positions for each player but it's probably easier to imagine the starting lineup as a dual combo guard (Russell/Clarkson) + SG (Kobe) wing/perimeter lineup. Even on D, with the switch-happy defensive scheme that NBA teams are employing these days, Kobe exclusively guarding top-tier SF's throughout the game (just because he's been slotted at the 3) is unlikely. Just look at the Finals when Iggy, Barnes, and Draymond guarded LBJ based on whether he was on iso-ing on the perimeter, post, or engaging in the PnR as the ball-handler or screener (among other factors)."

lakers,3cpl0t,aveydey,9,Thu Jul 9 19:39:37 2015 UTC,Outside of the guys you mentioned and maybe a few others I think he'll have an easier time guarding SFs than chasing around shooting guards like Klay Thompson and Kyle Korver. He's strong enough to play SF.
lakers,3cpl0t,zzyyxxqq,12,Thu Jul 9 19:47:57 2015 UTC,Jordan did it.
lakers,3cpl0t,santokimilktea,12,Thu Jul 9 19:46:49 2015 UTC,Guarding a 3 is less physically taxing than guarding a 2. This will be better for Kobe.
lakers,3cpl0t,justgivingsomeadvice,3,Thu Jul 9 19:54:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah Kobe's age will definitely affect his defense a bit, but not much I think depending on his offensive load. Hibbert will be a tremendous help and probably a good reason why Byron will have the flexibility. SF's will be stronger  and longer, but Kobe is pretty tall him self and has a lot of veteran experience with defense. I think he will be able to handle it.  Usually it's tougher guarding a position smaller if you're too slow to handle it. Also, nobody can guard Lebron and Durant :p"
lakers,3cpl0t,sharkytowers76,2,Thu Jul 9 19:48:03 2015 UTC,"Kobe is strong. He has a decent wingspan (6'11 I read online, not sure if reliable buy he always seemed to have a good wingspan). He can probably guard the 3 more easily than faster 2s. I'm more concerned with his off ball defense where he's been lazy since before he tore his Achilles. With Hibbert he can shade defenders towards the big man so his on ball defense should be fine."
lakers,3cpl0t,LotionATV,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:26:10 2015 UTC,"I believe the 2 and 3 are interchangeable in Byron's offense (I realize you're talking about D).  It seems like a lot of the league is going smaller and pushing everyone ""up"" a position.  I think Kobe will be fine."
lakers,3cpl0t,rhcp805,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:10:18 2015 UTC,Lebrun and Kwahi...shudders
lakers,3cpl0t,bul1dog,2,Fri Jul 10 17:08:52 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Bass start over Randle for now. Let Julius get his feet wet, there's no need to rush."
lakers,3cpl0t,Buckelroo,2,Fri Jul 10 06:35:35 2015 UTC,I'm so excited to see this lineup...
lakers,3cpl0t,sublime1123,2,Thu Jul 9 19:27:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think most figured this out when Byron said he was going to start DLo and Clarkson together."
lakers,3cpl0t,dalas3322,2,Thu Jul 9 19:30:25 2015 UTC,I have a raging clue now
lakers,3cpl0t,rtrainer30,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:33:58 2015 UTC,i'm fine with that there are guys his size who do it as well.  also better then him being on the perimeter with all the quality guards in the west
lakers,3cpl0t,mister_greyMATTER,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:02:14 2015 UTC,Probably best offensive line up but I wish they had an athletic wing defender which is what I was hoping Anthony Brown would turn into.
lakers,3cpl0t,FreshDiamond,6,Thu Jul 9 20:47:21 2015 UTC,"Or Nance, Jr. He was the Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year and seems really versatile."
lakers,3cr61k,GypsyKiller,21,Fri Jul 10 02:53:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's going to be interesting to see how long this starting line-up stays on the floor each game. The Lakers are going to have to operate with two different speeds; one while Hibbert and Kobe are on the floor, and another when they get subbed out. It's going to be a fun season to watch either way. Especially if we don't move Swaggy and will sub him in along side Lou. It's a good time to be a Lakers fan."
lakers,3cr61k,Buckelroo,7,Fri Jul 10 03:01:58 2015 UTC,Good point with the speed
lakers,3cr61k,jaysteezy24,2,Fri Jul 10 04:00:16 2015 UTC,"I think we can still play at an up tempo speed. It really depends on how smart the players are, they should look for the attack first and if its not there pull it out and wait for Kobe and Hibbert to get down the court and set up the offense."
lakers,3cr61k,Match3sMalon3,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:06:21 2015 UTC,"I think you make the best point that we can't overlook. It's going to be fun, we essentially get an extra ""rookie"" in Randle and seeing him develop alongside Clarkson and Russell is gonna be a blast. So much oomph imminent"
lakers,3cr61k,Notalent13,8,Fri Jul 10 13:37:04 2015 UTC,"Better team than last year, and IF Hibbert rediscovers his game from a couple years ago they could definitely challenge for a playoff spot. This is pretty much the best we could have realistically hoped for in this FA period.  I just hope we can find a way to trade Swaggy P midseason for either a late first rounder or a good young player (Preferably a SF or C)"
lakers,3cr61k,Rs_Eri,3,Fri Jul 10 05:06:13 2015 UTC,"Hibbert was essentially the same player he was the last few years, you just didn't hear about him because the Pacers were bad last year."
lakers,3cr61k,johnsonfrusciante,2,Fri Jul 10 08:09:44 2015 UTC,"that goes without saying. I don't think we'll make the playoffs (we would in the East, but probably not in the west), but this team is still lightyears ahead of last year's"
lakers,3cr61k,Citizen_of_Atlantis,3,Fri Jul 10 12:34:06 2015 UTC,I'm getting really excited for this upcoming season. I love this young group of players and hope they beat expectations.
lakers,3cr61k,lufty574,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:05:19 2015 UTC,"I was excited before because of all the young blood and potential. But now with Hibbert, I think if some of the young players have good years they can make it to the playoffs."
lakers,3cr61k,khighyle,2,Fri Jul 10 04:32:04 2015 UTC,"Bench of Lou, Swaggy, Bass Nance jr and Black isn't shabby at all."

lakers,3cr61k,toptier,8,Fri Jul 10 03:27:27 2015 UTC,"Lou, Swaggy, Nance Jr, Jabari Brown, Anthony Brown, Tarik Black, Brandon Bass, Kelly, Sacre, Upshaw(maybe)"
lakers,3cr61k,harleq01,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:40:59 2015 UTC,This is a really young starting lineup. I can see Byron replacing either Randle or Clarkson with one of the vets in the starting lineup after training camp makes things more clear what kind of squad we have.
lakers,3cr61k,dalas3322,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:38:31 2015 UTC,"I mean our bench is nothing to laugh at.  Lou, Bass, Black, upshaw, Nance, and fuck it I like the Anthony Brown kid.  We need a bench PG though. that's probably where our 2.8Mil is going to go."
lakers,3cr61k,johnsonfrusciante,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:09:22 2015 UTC,a lot of this depends on hibbert anchoring that defense.  he has shown the ability to do it at a elite level though so i'm cautiously optimistic
lakers,3crd0i,nikkus,6,Fri Jul 10 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"Nice video. Hibbert and Bass, are going whip our boys into shape on the defensive end. Man, I hope things work out with Upshaw during the summer league. We have all the pieces to tutor him into a defensive powerhouse to play along side our young core. Tarik isn't too sloppy on the defensive side either. Im excited for our boys moving forward."
lakers,3crd0i,Buckelroo,5,Fri Jul 10 04:13:25 2015 UTC,"It'll be nice to have a solid squad. Even if we don't make the playoffs, it will be fun to watch games this season. Hopefully everyone can stay healthy."
lakers,3crd0i,Buckelroo,5,Fri Jul 10 04:15:32 2015 UTC,"Health is key. I've bought league pass since I moved out of LA in 2011. Watching Kobe's vino season was worth it, next season will be worth it as well."
lakers,3crd0i,loserlame,2,Fri Jul 10 04:21:25 2015 UTC,I want Upshaw to be the Dalembert to Hibberts' Motumbo.
lakers,3crd0i,Mantis-Toboggin,4,Fri Jul 10 11:11:45 2015 UTC,Perfect fit for our team
lakers,3crd0i,UltraFlyingTurtle,3,Fri Jul 10 04:22:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that vid. I liked how well Hibbert defended the pick-and-roll, as well man-on-man defense against quicker guys, by lowering his stance. Interesting stuff.  The combo of Hibbert with defensive wing like Paul George was so good on defense. I hope one of our guys can fill that defensive wing role (or are able to get one in the future). I know Anthony Brown said he's been trying to beef up his defensive abilities."
lakers,3crd0i,Truesince97,2,Fri Jul 10 04:36:28 2015 UTC,KJ McDaniels would be Purrrfect for that role! Man that wing averaged 1.5 blocks per game!
lakers,3crd0i,_FreshG,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:20:30 2015 UTC,Fucking Houston buried him on the bench
lakers,3crd0i,Truesince97,2,Fri Jul 10 05:59:59 2015 UTC,"That's good, his value has gotten lower, we can steal him with our remaining cap"

lakers,3cqp76,Theoryman101,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:47:33 2015 UTC,Instead of backward dunks he does backward lay ups off the glass. Seems like he's got the skills and desire to compete for his playing time.
lakers,3cqp76,Donkeykongalan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:51:13 2015 UTC,"Who I think will shine is Clarkson, Randle, Nance, and Russell, in that order.  Who needs to shine is Upshaw - he looks out of shape and a step too slow to get to spots."
lakers,3cqp76,BionicSix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:25:20 2015 UTC,"Clarkson, not necessarily because he has the highest upside but simply because he has the most experience.  He should eat everyone up simply with knowledge of the game.  Seeing talent shine through by the end of summer league will be key.  Russel, Randle could and should be the best players on the court in flashes."

lakers,3cphzu,BeefCat10,2,Thu Jul 9 19:14:15 2015 UTC,he is not a good finisher with his right hand. In college he would turn down open right handed layups for harder left handed layups. He would also turn down easy right handed jump hooks for contested left handed floaters and or runners.
lakers,3cphzu,Boozers_Hair_Care,3,Thu Jul 9 19:21:06 2015 UTC,Hibbert has left and right hooks. Hopefully it spreads...

I could see him growing into a mini Carmelo Anthony (hear me out on this), the bull/ox comparison really stuck out to me because Kobe once compared Melo to a bull, saying he was pretty much impossible to guard on a drive in. Randle plays bully ball, and is quick off the dribble, it's a good comparison to Melo's dribble penetration game imo.  Odom is still the superior playmaker though"

lakers,3cphzu,newgenduder,4,Thu Jul 9 22:57:42 2015 UTC,During the draft everyone was comparing him to Zach Randolph. Does anyone else think he could just be a less athletic Blake Griffin?
lakers,3cphzu,LetsGetADrink,3,Thu Jul 9 19:27:35 2015 UTC,He's more of a less athletic Lebron in my opinion. Randle is willing to get in there and absorb contact. Not contort in the air constantly to avoid it like Griffin.

This years team is NOT built to give us flexibility in the next FA period, rather its built to let us play our young guys and maybe possibly hopefully sign a star. Our only notable FA's will be Kobe and Hibbert, Kobe will probably retire, and hopefully we can work out a reasonable deal to keep Hibbert (30 mil over 2 years)."

And Hibbert waiving his trade kicker to come here would also seem to indicate he has interest staying past this season.  Last year's team basically everyone was on a 1 year deal so it was more or less expected they were just place holders."
lakers,3crsv0,stevebeyten,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:41:28 2015 UTC,"I think Hibbert is more interested in proving he still has something to offer after his downturn in Indy than he is about coming to the Lakers specifically.  Coulda been anywhere, probably."

When we were in the Smush Parker/Kwame Brown era, I would get so frustrated watching games, I'd routinely tell anyone who'd listen, we should fire everyone except Kobe.  Chris Mihm for Fuck's sake.    The reality of it is, we all get attached to players who play hard for our team, or who have potential, or whatever. But let's keep in mind, last year's team was constructed of 1-year contracts for guys who would have to prove themselves to us in order to earn a return.  What exactly did these players prove to you during our 21-win season that makes you think they should be part of our franchise going forward and worthy of eating up our cap space?    Let go, folks.

lakers,3crsv0,Remote95,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:27:29 2015 UTC,"Well i don't think this will be the case from here on out. We have some really intriguing prospects that include Russell, Nance, Brown, Upshaw, and if they pan out the way we all think they will then we won't be getting rid of a bunch of players anymore. Seems like it'll be all about development from here on out until other elite players take notice and want to join us with our upside."
lakers,3cqsxc,LakeshowAA24,11,Fri Jul 10 01:01:17 2015 UTC,"Not just Kobe to consider. But the rest of the roster as well. Lakers have been decimated by injuries since 2012. The Roster as a whole would have to stay healthy.  plus, its alot to expect of rookies and young players to win 40+ games. things take a bit of time especially at that level to get accustomed to the rules, the grind, the travel, the expectations, and how much crazy good talent they have to face every night"
lakers,3cqsxc,NicDwolfwood,4,Fri Jul 10 01:41:34 2015 UTC,"What? Lol 41-37 is 78 games, I'm pretty sure they went 45-37 which is what you meant?  But yeah, that's not how it works. The Pels will probably get better and hit 50, but the Mavs and Blazers are falling out. So really, they need to beat the Suns, Jazz, and Kings. I am not sold on the Suns at all and think they're gonna be a 35 win team. The Kings might implode or they might go for 45 wins, who knows?   The Jazz are the guys who I think are prime to hit a mid-40 win season and get to the playoffs. I hope not, but I can't see the Lakers winning more than 38-39 games , so to get that 8 seed we'd need all 3 of those teams to be very disappointing"
lakers,3cqsxc,justgivingsomeadvice,3,Fri Jul 10 01:06:53 2015 UTC,I like that we've got a lot more defense this year. That'll help and Russell's passing. If Kobe stays healthy there'll be a lot more wins shared all around.
lakers,3cqsxc,Donkeykongalan,3,Fri Jul 10 06:53:27 2015 UTC,Everyone has to be healthy and playing at their best if we want a shot at the playoffs.
lakers,3cqsxc,lakerswiz,3,Fri Jul 10 02:47:56 2015 UTC,"The whole Kobe sitting out games may not come into play this year per Byron Scott. And the shoulder was tore in preseason not seasons past so yeah I look for a lot more efficient Kobe and if he led the league in scoring for a couple months last year with that shoulder I don't think he plans on scoring less than 20 this year. Can't predict his numbers, points or position but it's going to be some pretty spectacular stuff no matter what."
lakers,3cqsxc,Donkeykongalan,3,Fri Jul 10 01:19:15 2015 UTC,Spurs  Warriors Thunder Rockets  Clippers Grizzlies Pelicans ........?  Maybe the 8th seed but it's going to take a miracle.
lakers,3cqsxc,p0se1d0n,6,Fri Jul 10 02:45:01 2015 UTC,"70 games is real optimistic. If he gets 60 that'd be dope. And its also about how he plays. If he plays like he did against cleveland, we win more games cuz kobe takes what the defense gives him and still gets his through high percentage looks. He's more then capable of being a 18 and 9 guy if he wants. Even if he plays that way and everything goes right, I can't see us making the playoffs. Hopefully we win close to 40 games and our rookies develop because thats the most important think. You're really sleeping on Utah though. That team is on the come up real quick. I can see us being nine or ten. If we do make the playoffs though, that'd be dope though."
lakers,3cqsxc,megavino,2,Fri Jul 10 05:02:19 2015 UTC,I could see this scenario but think about this. I know we are all hyped on the young guys but they are all question marks and even if they are great there will be growing pains. I see everyone ruling the Blazers out of the playoffs. They will be young but not as young as us. They are probably going to add kanter which is a pretty damn good replacement for aldridge. Our young players have more upside but if they add kanter that's huge. To if you say healthy Kobe equals with the Blazers missing out that comes down to one thing. Kobe Bryant today is better than Dame Lillard is today. I don't think that's true and for that reason I think the Blazers will be better than the lakers. That doesn't mean they make the playoffs either.
lakers,3cqsxc,FreshDiamond,2,Fri Jul 10 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"I was arguing this with a friend who is a ""clippers fan""       NBA is more than just talent, if a team can believe in each other and play together they can overachieve. I believe our guys are close knit and as soon as everyone settles in to their roles we might surprise some people.       another big thing that people are forgetting, OKC, new coach, new system, team isn't gonna start winning right out the gate, just look at the cavs before the all star break.      NO, new coach, new system, same deal.        It's not crazy to say we can make the playoffs."

I have high hopes for him, let's see if he can live up to the hype  another edit: some of you guys REALLY need to stop living in the past, Kobe hasn't been able to stay healthy for the last 2 seasons in a row and is approaching 40... he's done. build a bridge and get over it"

lakers,3crnog,arkansastraffic,3,Fri Jul 10 09:42:07 2015 UTC,I think we sign Alonzo Gee in the next couple days. He'd be a good backup to Kobe and could even start when we play an elite SF like Lebron so Kobe doesn't have to waste a lot of energy on defense.
lakers,3crnog,Honest_Joseph,3,Fri Jul 10 06:43:21 2015 UTC,Look for a decent SF.
lakers,3crnog,thevisitor,3,Fri Jul 10 07:16:47 2015 UTC,"Need an SF. A few that I see from the free agent tracker (which is outdated, so I might accidentally list a player who has already signed somewhere):  Josh Smith- Probably won't take such a small amount, but I mean he's still getting good pay from Detroit. Maybe he can be convinced. He's meeting with the Kings who are probably going to throw a stupid amount of money at him, though.  KJ McDaniels- Not sure if even possible using the Room Exception (doesn't it need to be a minimum of three years or some shit...RFA contracts are fucking confusing). Undersized but can guard reliably and has a nice stroke. My personal favorite if it's possible.  Tayshaun Prince- Beggars can't be choosers? I don't know. Was he any good last season?  Quincy Acy- Gritty player. Decent season with the Knicks. Doesn't look like he has a great 3 point shot. Have no idea about his defense honestly.  Luke Babbit- Can shoot the three ball well (51% last season, but could have easily been a fluke). Not sure about his defense but I'm going to fancy a guess that it isn't that good.  Rasual Butler- Next  Chris Copeland- NEXT  Gigi Datome- Eh? I guess he played okay for the Celtics last season? Don't remember him all that much.  Austin Daye- He's never even been a mediocre player. 6'11"" SF who probably should have tried to become a PF. Terrible. Has championship experience though lol.  Luc Mbah a Moute- This would be respectable. Three point shot isn't quite there (he'll shoot it, though) but he's a good defender and had a respectable season in Philly. 3rd best option.    Unless Mitch is dead-set on giving Nance or Anothony Brown the bench SF spot, we're going to end up with one of these guys.  Oh and sorry if I missed any, guys. The official NBA FA tracker actually really sucks. Alonzo Gee would be alright."

lakers,3crnog,WOX_69,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:15:09 2015 UTC,I don't think it's going to happen but I would definitely get a laugh from your celebration thread haha. I thought the D'Antoni Farewell celebration was pretty big around here hahaha.

lakers,3cov3w,Wateriswet1212,47,Thu Jul 9 16:12:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know whether we can make it or not, but it would be so great. Some people say that a first round exit does nothing for our team long-term, but I respectfully disagree. With the amount of young players our team has, even if the Warriors sweep us in the first round, that's four games of playoff experience for Russell, Clarkson, Randle, et al. That's fucking invaluable.  EDIT: plus I want the Sixers to have as low a pick as possible. Maybe petty, but I don't care."
lakers,3cov3w,DeeMoniaEelRak,17,Thu Jul 9 16:44:51 2015 UTC,Reminds me of when Thunder were young'ns and we beat them in the first round. They got their experience and have then since gotten much better.
lakers,3cov3w,rdf-,9,Thu Jul 9 18:40:27 2015 UTC,Yeah our first round series with Phoenix when we were the 8th were frustrating as hell but they were still great to watch (in hindsight) and were important for our development back towards champions
lakers,3cov3w,chekhovs_gunn,13,Thu Jul 9 18:40:14 2015 UTC,For a lot of people it's NBA Finals or tank. Are you fn kidding me?!
lakers,3cov3w,Titanosaurus,4,Thu Jul 9 17:29:15 2015 UTC,There's no pint ranking because we will most likely lose the pick
lakers,3cov3w,superindian25,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:45:51 2015 UTC,"yeah, thats in the context of a team with a pick. We don't have any pick so I'd be down for any type of playoff b-ball."
lakers,3cov3w,dabolympian710,4,Fri Jul 10 03:38:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll make it this year but in some cases a first round playoff exit can be pretty good.  It's good for the young rookies to get a taste of the playoffs, but it's also good to attract free agents.  2 years ago the Wizards made the playoffs with a young core and were able to bring in Paul Pierce, a couple of years ago a playoff season helped the Pacers bring in David West.  Getting the 8th seed or even having a record that would have been in the eastern playoffs is not a bad thing for us, it just depends on a lot of factors."
lakers,3cov3w,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:27:07 2015 UTC,Anthony Davis definitely improved from those four games.
lakers,3cov3w,tornadodolphin,19,Fri Jul 10 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't bet anything against kobe. Even at 36, he can will this team to the 8th spot."
lakers,3cov3w,avengedteddy,10,Thu Jul 9 17:26:34 2015 UTC,"I wonder if Kobe would be better off if he just cools it and stops trying to do the things he was able to do when he was younger.  Jordan played pretty well with the Wizards (I blame the lack of talent for failing to get the team to the playoffs), Even in his later career with the Bulls I imagine that he was able to play so well because he didn't try to be who he was in his 20's.  He quit trying to be late 80's/early 90's Air Jordan super athlete freak.   Instead, he developed a great jump shot and just worked on being an efficient scorer through excellent fundamental basketball.  If Kobe plays far more conservative but still effective this season I imagine his risk for injuries will be much lower.  I think that's one reason why Tim Duncan is still good at the age he currently is."
lakers,3cov3w,Andrew_Korenchkin,2,Thu Jul 9 18:56:34 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly. But its kobe... we can predict by knowing his past. He isn't going to change, especially with scott at the helm. I just hope he doesn't shoot 25-30 times. If he can just shoot 15 shots a game, im all for that."
lakers,3cov3w,avengedteddy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:03:35 2015 UTC,15 shots? Lol. That won't happen.
lakers,3cov3w,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:47:22 2015 UTC,"Michael could get the Hornets to the playoffs, if he wanted."
lakers,3cov3w,Cienes,5,Fri Jul 10 01:37:39 2015 UTC,"Seriously, he has done it before and with worse teams. No way our team is worse than the smush Parker and Chris mihm days, plus I think we have a really talented trio with Russell, Jordan, and Julius that is gonna fuck shit up. I say we get somewhere between the #6-9 seed this season, and yeah I know saying us getting the #6th seed is crazy but if we get a good SF I think it might be doable, if our rookies pan out and Jordan clarkson is even more of a beast this season. Especially if you factor in Kobe looking to prove something this season, and if his body is feeling good physically then watch out."
lakers,3cov3w,DuncanDonuts32,6,Thu Jul 9 18:30:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah and kobe was in the midst of his prime and ten years younger.  Not saying it's impossible, but be realistic about kobe and stop expecting the guy to carry us"
lakers,3cov3w,gpholmes1,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:39:04 2015 UTC,"no, i cant face reality. l Remember he did get will the lakers to the 8th seed with an injured howard and pau. Now he has 2 rookies and a 1 year player in clarkson... and hibbert... tougher but not impossible."
lakers,3cov3w,avengedteddy,2,Thu Jul 9 21:07:33 2015 UTC,"It's not about Kobe's will, or ability, it's about his body. The chances he plays a full season are very small if we're being totally clear-eyed about the situation."
lakers,3cov3w,metrofeed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:56:41 2015 UTC,I don't think Kobe trying to will a team to victory is the right path for us to make the playoffs or the kids learning the ropes.
lakers,3cov3w,xodus112,3,Thu Jul 9 19:17:29 2015 UTC,"he can will a team in other ways. not just shooting 25-30 times. he can pass more, take better shots, actually play kobe-like defense (like team-USA), etc. he can make everyone better as a leader. Also don't scoff at kobe's defense. IF he tries, he can be a bruce-bowen type defender. I hope he takes his foot off the offensive pedal and focus more on his defensive ability."
lakers,3cov3w,avengedteddy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:09:49 2015 UTC,"If he were to take that approach, I'd be thrilled. I love Kobe, but he doesn't seem to be the type that's wired that way. It's not that long ago that he said he would retire if he averaged 18/19 ppg. I'd love if he re-evaluated that, his body at this stage of his career and the team's needs, though."
lakers,3cov3w,xodus112,2,Fri Jul 10 12:13:38 2015 UTC,I'd say that depends if it's working or not
lakers,3cov3w,LeBaconator,5,Thu Jul 9 19:37:53 2015 UTC,You guys are overrating phoenix. They finished the season 11-23. After Dragic left they were quite poor. Biggest threat is probably Sacramento and Utah but we are in similar tier if healthy hopefully
lakers,3cov3w,Scabandiri,9,Thu Jul 9 19:15:20 2015 UTC,"I think it's SAC, then PHX, then us."
lakers,3cov3w,TheAsianMamba,17,Thu Jul 9 16:24:20 2015 UTC,"Sac can easily implode with Rondo. I'd be more concerned with the Jazz, I'm not convinced the Suns will be good but the Jazz were great after they traded Kanter and it was reproducible (playing stifling D)"
lakers,3cov3w,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Thu Jul 9 16:56:29 2015 UTC,If the Jazz do better than the Lakers I will cry.
lakers,3cov3w,Haiko248,7,Thu Jul 9 17:06:27 2015 UTC,Get the tissues ready.  The Jazz were a surprise post-ASG last season.  Finished 19-10.  I fully expect them to do better than the Lakers.
lakers,3cov3w,hoverbikes,4,Thu Jul 9 17:39:41 2015 UTC,They will this year. Get ready to shed some tears.
lakers,3cov3w,greenstuf,3,Thu Jul 9 17:38:19 2015 UTC,"If the Kings do better than the Lakers, I'll punch myself in the dick."

lakers,3cov3w,LeBaconator,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:39:08 2015 UTC,exactly. Shouldn't be a problem.
lakers,3cov3w,probotic,3,Fri Jul 10 16:53:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted, Sacramento has the best player out of those teams, some shooting with mclemore and bellinelli, and rondo on a contract year. Between Trill, Rudy Gay, and Rondo they have some great defenders.  After that I'd put the Jazz up there if they can improve their offense.  Unfortunately, the Lakers may have the hardest run out of those candidates, but we may be in it. Here's to Kobe going all out and the youngins having breakout years."
lakers,3cov3w,yungJoc,3,Thu Jul 9 18:23:48 2015 UTC,rondo on a contract year   Rondo was just on a contract year and he played like ass tho
lakers,3cov3w,itwentboom,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:26:57 2015 UTC,"True, but this is it for him. He's gonna go all out and be a good distributor for them."
lakers,3cov3w,yungJoc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"The problem was never his passing though, it's his dreadful free throw shooting which causes him to not drive the ball and below average shooting. His lack of scoring allows opponents to take away from his passing game."
lakers,3cov3w,toomanypumpfakes,3,Thu Jul 9 20:44:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, our team is pretty decent. Kobe is Kobe. Lou Will brings the scoring off the bench, Hibbert brings the defense, Bass brings the hustle, add all that to the young core of Russell/Clarkson/Randle. I say playoffs in two years, and FA's will want to sign here once again."
lakers,3cov3w,myzticaznfool,2,Thu Jul 9 19:57:47 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think we're as good as those teams (aside from Maybe Phoenix honestly), but who knows, this roster is basically brand new"
lakers,3cov3w,SpaceCowboy170,2,Thu Jul 9 16:47:15 2015 UTC,"The bad news is that it and it robbed basketball fans from one of Dirk's last years.  Injuries aside we are likely going to finish behind Utah and Phoenix, possibly Sacramento and Denver too.  We have a lot of minutes slated going to rookies and sophomores and the only teams in the west I feel confident that we are better than are Dallas and Portland.  Utah was killing it last year after they traded away Kanter, they're my guess for the 8th seed."
lakers,3cov3w,_im_on_acid_,2,Thu Jul 9 16:47:44 2015 UTC,"Making the playoffs shouldn't be tied to other teams, since so much changes. A much simpler way to think about it is, will the Lakers get 50 wins? Because that's generally a safe cutoff.  Also, you're neglecting the Jazz. They are headed for 50 wins."
lakers,3cov3w,rjvir,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:55:19 2015 UTC,"i think if dallas got DJ, the bottom 3 of the west would be wide open, but now it would just be the bottom 2."
lakers,3cov3w,ByTheBeardOfBruce,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:43:21 2015 UTC,Exactly what I was thinking! 2 good teams vs 1 great team and 1 lottery team.
lakers,3cov3w,PropJoe123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:11:54 2015 UTC,if we can get a solid 3&d it would be nice
lakers,3cov3w,LoneScum,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:10:40 2015 UTC,I dunno about that seeding. I feel like the Clippers with DJ and a better bench are gonna be at least 3rd seed. And the Spurs might be better than the Warriors.   Anyway yea we could possibly sneak into the 8th seed if Sac doesn't get there first. Rondo is still Rondo.   Also a dark horse candidate for 8th seed is Minnesota. They're in the exact same boat as us. Wiggins is already a beast. If Towns ends up being good they could win out.
lakers,3cov3w,ashishvp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:30:41 2015 UTC,"8th seed team in the West was still had over .500 record. I don't think Kobe and a bunch of rooks are going to win more than half their games, but I'll be entertained and cheering them on as they try."
lakers,3cov3w,Cienes,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:39:19 2015 UTC,"I have Sacramento and Utah above us.   Sacramento when it's starters were in had a top 4 starting lineup  but when the bench came in they had a bottom 3 lineup.    They've improved their bench,  and can have a full season of DMC and George Karl (if the team doesn't implode)  I can see them making the playoffs.   Utah -  after removing Kanter  had a very strong finish to the season.   Their youth will be able to improve on their finish while the Lakers youth are trying to figure it out during the season.   Suns -  I don't know anything about them anymore but they supposedly have talent on the team so I don't know how to rank them.   LA should be able to challenge for #9 but the teams I mentioned will make it hard for the Lakers to leapfrog them into the playoffs."
lakers,3cov3w,LowkeyAnushole,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:56:29 2015 UTC,Nope. Still eight spots. And I guarantee NO takes at least the right seed. They leaps and bounds ahead of us in every aspect. I see where you're coming from though.
lakers,3cov3w,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:45:43 2015 UTC,Clippers are much better than the rockets. And will be 50/50 for the third spot.
lakers,3cov3w,erun4dayz,-1,Thu Jul 9 16:34:29 2015 UTC,How are the Rockets not better than the Clippers?
lakers,3cov3w,kushalKD,11,Thu Jul 9 16:47:22 2015 UTC,As of now the Rockets haven't brought back Jason Terry or Josh Smith and have only added Decker to their roster.  That alone drops them below the Clippers who have actually done stuff to improve their roster with Pierce and Lance.
lakers,3cov3w,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:59:00 2015 UTC,I think it's likely they will bring back smith
lakers,3cov3w,LeBaconator,2,Thu Jul 9 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"I think the Rockets have no choice but to bring back Smith or take a step back next year.  Still, the Clippers have made improvements on last years roster while the most Houston appears capable of in free agency is just treading water.  Clipps could have really used Pierce's help closing out game 6 last year..."
lakers,3cov3w,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:24:27 2015 UTC,They have more or less the same exact roster. In fact its a little weaker without Josh Smith. Meanwhile the Clippers made improvements to their bench with Paul Pierce and Lance.
lakers,3cov3w,ashishvp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:32:42 2015 UTC,suns got tyson and have a near all star back court.  sac still has demarcus/gay and minnesota has a nice young core there including roty wiggins.  don't count out dallas as they still have dirk/parsons/wes so and their pick is top 7 so no need to go super tank mode.  playoffs are at least a year away it won't happen this season.  we will be better than utah though
lakers,3cov3w,dalas3322,2,Thu Jul 9 17:36:14 2015 UTC,Utah will be better than every other team you mention in your post.
lakers,3cov3w,youretellingme,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:36:04 2015 UTC,the Jazz will make the playoffs everybody. their defense is excellent and they have depth.

lakers,3cov3w,ashishvp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:15:24 2015 UTC,I think the downvoting is due less to the team mob mentality and more to you just being a dick.
lakers,3cq80f,Buckelroo,12,Thu Jul 9 22:10:48 2015 UTC,"It's for a second round pick and cash. So basically, just a second round pick.  For as much hate the FO got in recent days, this turned out to be an underrated move. The only way it could have been better is if we unloaded Young, but that's not too bad.  If Hibbert recovers his level, and likes it in LA, we might have our center for the next couple of years, acquired for a second round pick. If he doesn't recover his level, then we let him leave as a FA next year, and only lost a second round pick. Low-risk, high-reward type of move. Not too shabby."
lakers,3cq80f,MrGoosemahn,10,Thu Jul 9 22:20:00 2015 UTC,Nick Young not leaving isn't good or bad. He balled out in 2013-2014. He was just injured a lot of last year. I wouldn't count him out yet.
lakers,3cq80f,kushalKD,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:22:17 2015 UTC,"True. It will be interesting to see how the guard rotation works. Kobe, Russell, Clarkson, Williams, and Young have arguments for playing time, with the first three being the clear priorities. It's great depth in case of injuries, and we should be scoring by the boatload with them.   Also gives us a lot of versatility with line-ups. Russell, Clarkson, Kobe, Russell, Williams, Kobe, Clarkson, Williams, Kobe, Russell, Young, Kobe, etc."
lakers,3cq80f,MrGoosemahn,3,Thu Jul 9 22:24:45 2015 UTC,"As much as I wish his game was more consistent, Swaggy is good for the team. He keeps a certain amount of attention on us even though we haven't been playing well. Plus, he's a hometown kid. I'd like to keep him unless we get something really good out of a trade."
lakers,3cq80f,MrGoosemahn,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:01:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his consistency is definitely his main issue. He's limited to being a role player, in my opinion. He's a very lop-sided player, dedicated solely to offense. Him and Lou Williams will be very similar, they're great scorers, but not particularly great at anything else.  It's tough to expect more from him, though, as he can be one of the best at being a bench scorer. But so is Lou Williams. I think the team might also be tired of some of Young's behavior too.  In any case, I still think the team will try to find a way to unload his contract, so that's why I mentioned it would have been good to trade him to Indy. We wouldn't have to take on anyone else, who could potentially eat up minutes from someone else.  He's like JR Smith and those kind of guys. Great when they're good, but they can really bring a team down when their shot is off."
lakers,3cq80f,DJyoungHeisenberg,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:06:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of Nick Young, but he can be a good piece off the bench esp. if Kobe can play a full season. No clowning allowed , it's all business. Plus Byron Scott has no choice last year to play Swaggy, that's all he had. Now with a little more fire power and hungrier players in front and behind him, he can hopefully get some much needed focus to strive for the team."
lakers,3cq80f,DuncanDonuts32,0,Thu Jul 9 23:06:25 2015 UTC,"Nick young is fucking horrible, and so is his attitude. Countless times he gave up on D and just stood there, and the rumors of him cheating on iggy were not just random, there were pics of him with other girls, one pic of this hot girl driving his car...that Iggy gave him for this birthday. He is overrated and I do not want him back."

Black and Hibbert are better than him, and we need to get Upshaw some minutes if we sign him.  If swaggy stays then we can put him/Kobe/Swaggy Degree at the 3, with Bass and Randle at the four, essentially taking all of Kelly's minutes, so no need for him either"
lakers,3cq80f,SpaceCowboy170,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:07:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure if the team has to fill roster spots, but you keep Sacre because he gets paid very little, appears to be somewhat satisfied with his role, and is another big to have during practice sessions."
lakers,3cq80f,SpaceCowboy170,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:22:04 2015 UTC,I agree.  Of the three he's the most likely to stay.  We'll probably try to move swaggy because the backcourt is crowded and it makes some nice cap space.  Kelly will probably stay because he can play the 3 or 4 and isn't paid that much

lakers,3cqgid,barath_s,2,Fri Jul 10 07:25:13 2015 UTC,"I think the thread posted yesterday or so about young guys explains it better. The young guys in the league are all guys who spent their entire lives playing AAU basketball putting heavy mileage on their bodies. It was a long, but great read.

lakers,3cqgid,thabizznezz,2,Fri Jul 10 01:32:29 2015 UTC,"Gary Vitti has been around forever and is more than just a trainer.  The trainer is the first line of communication in players injuries,  (along with the strength and conditioning / physicalk therapist)  That said, not much a trainer can do with broken bones etc.  The Lakers don't seem to have a track records of multiple medical interventions, misdiagnosis or differing dates of return that is the sign of bad medical staff. (See bulls). Some of it may be ascribed to good messaging, but that too is a sign of a competent front office..  They  do have equipment (eg reduced gravity running through use of air pressure)  though that may be the norm for major NBA teams. (none of that liquid nitrogen chill chambers)   And Gary Vitti was ahead of the curve with Kobe's German knee docs"
lakers,3cqgid,barath_s,0,Fri Jul 10 01:52:24 2015 UTC,Are you sure that was Vitti with the knee injections? I'm pretty sure that was all Kobe
lakers,3cqgid,p0se1d0n,4,Fri Jul 10 04:04:01 2015 UTC,"Yep, I am sure. There was an article about it at the time. Vitti did the research on treatment options and recommended Orthokine/Regenokine to Kobe to decide.   Found the link: Trainer's Take Part Two   You [Vitti] were actually the person who brought the idea and information to Kobe about the procedure, Gary. Can you take us through how it all started?   Vitti: .... Karyn Silver, the wife of Joel Silver, mentioned it to me ...[Vitti investigated and later].. I told Kobe I thought he should do it, and do it immediately so that if we didn't get a good result, we could do something else. He bought into that logic...   Part One is also worth reading; it talks about Dr Judy Seto, who worked with Kobe and the team for a part time long before becoming full time and about Tim DiFrancesco, who is an athletic trainer and physical therapist in addition to being the strength and conditioning coach  It also talks about preventive care including focus on alignment..  I'm not sure if the Lakers are truly ahead of the curve or just on a fad on their nutrition, but they (or at least consultant Dr. Cate Shanahan) certainly have a specific point of view  advocating bone broth, specific fats and grass fed meat and against sugar that has influenced Dwight, Nash, Kobe etc all to some extent at least."

lakers,3cs7xk,Maniac_24,2,Fri Jul 10 10:18:21 2015 UTC,"The additional money already went to Lou Williams and Brandon Bass.   This article talks about it . There were strong murmurs that the lakers didn't have enough cap to sign Lou with the cap at 67, but some cap increase was expected.  Hibbert's trade kicker complicates things because apparently it can be waived under some particular conditions freeing up extra cash.  The Lakers have also held off on signing the rookies...and they get it done now.  While the cap hold for an unsigned first round rookie is 100% of the rookie scale, it is customary to sign them at 120%. So D'Angelo and Nance Jr get a bump,   Edit: The extra 20% for 1st round rookies doesn't count against salary cap ..  The Lakers could hold off giving Bass the extra money, but probably won't. They could use the room exception and the minimums to flesh out their roster, most probably a backup SF or PG (Kobe, Nick, Randle, Kelly, Sacre, Black,  likely Jabari Brown, Hibbert, Bass, Lou Williams, D'Angelo, Clarkson, Anthony Brown and Larry Nance make 14, and the lakers have traditionally preferred to have 14 instead of the maximum 15 or the minimum 12).   The Lakers may pick up someone from the summer tryouts (upshaw?) but could also cut or trade one or more players if they find more players they like better. The two Browns are candidates for being cut (Jabari is unguaranteed as is Anthony as a second round pick) as are Kelly, perhaps Sacre/Black"
lakers,3cs7xk,barath_s,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:07:36 2015 UTC,Can we realisticly sign any other FA without dumping some contracts ( young for example) or are we done making FA signings?
lakers,3cs7xk,barath_s,3,Fri Jul 10 12:15:40 2015 UTC,"I ran the numbers ...based on hoopshype, basketball reference, newspaper reports and CBA FAQ    Player Name Salary in USD Note    Kobe Bryant $25,000,000 Guaranteed   Nick Young $5,219,169 Guaranteed   Julius Randle $3,132,240 Guaranteed   Ryan Kelly $1,724,250 Guaranteed   Robert Sacre $845,059 Lakers picked up the team option for $981,358, but the league picks up the difference1   Tarik Black $845,059 Minimum   Jabari Brown $845,059 Team option; not guaranteed.

He can get upto 17.8 due to trade kicker but may have waived some or all of the extra   Lou Williams $6,700,000 6.7 reported for year 1   Brandon  Bass $4,000,000 Assumption. Details not announced. Hibberts extra cash likely goes here   D'Angelo Russell $4,252,600 100% of rookie scale for pick 2. He will actually get a contract for 120%   Larry Nance $963,000 100% of rookie scale for pick 27. He will actually get a contract for 120%   Anthony Brown $525,093 NBA Minimum for rookie player - this is traditional for 2nd round   Total $70,196,588 There may be some slop in figures for  Hibbert or Bass or Lou. NBA is picking up some of the tab for Sacre 1     IIRC the NBA picks up some of the tab for veteran minimum players. If you have a 3+ year veteran on a minimum salary, the NBA picks up the tab beyond the 2 year minimum. Sacre is a 3 year veteran making the minimum. That means the NBA is paying 136,299 od his 981,358 tab and the salary cap calculation thereby lower by that amount; i.e . Only 8450,59 of his salary counts towards the cap.   Ref The CBA FAQ  Edit: The NBA has cap holds to ensure you have a minimum of 12 players. So perhaps the Lakers exceed the cap to sign their returning free agent Tarik Black as the 13th man.?"
lakers,3cs7xk,barath_s,2,Fri Jul 10 13:04:05 2015 UTC,The Lakers still have the $2.8 million room exception available to sign a FA without dumping contracts. This article mentions some of the possible candidates.  That's going to net you only a lower end backup as FA...There may be veteran minimum signings or summer cap pickups as well ...I figure Mitch will probably wait to make his next move ..  I'm still confused on how much of the trade kicker Hibbert is supposed to have waived; reports indicate he waived some (all?) of it ($2.3 million or so). I think it extremely likely that the extra cash will just go to Bass.
lakers,3cqads,sharke93,6,Thu Jul 9 22:29:02 2015 UTC,"Underrated. Got lost on defense a bit last season, but when he was on, he was giving other PGs fits (the only PG that I can remember truly schooling him was Ty Lawson and that was near the beginning of his starting role). Has the length and speed to potentially blossom into a combo guard that can guard both the 1 and 2 well."
lakers,3cqads,arkansastraffic,5,Thu Jul 9 23:35:22 2015 UTC,"Clarkson? He's not great. But mostly because he's young. He puts in the effort he just makes a lot of rookie mistakes, I think he'll be a plus defender"
lakers,3cqads,Kbmakaveli,3,Thu Jul 9 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"Hard to say so far, but he's been I'd say good for a rookie PG. I still feel he'll be our Mike Conley when it's all said and done at the rate he's going. If you didn't know, Conley is one of the better defenders in the league."
lakers,3cqads,TuneHD,4,Fri Jul 10 01:25:43 2015 UTC,"Jordan Clarkson? A work in progress. He has the speed, IMO, he just doesn't have it down. Per his Player's Tribune article, the first practice they had, he had the unfortunate task of guarding Kobe. And Kobe immediately took him to the baseline and did his patented fade away to the baseline shot with Clarkson looking like he got off balance from it. Kobe swished it on him."
lakers,3cqads,JesusSama,3,Thu Jul 9 22:33:07 2015 UTC,"He's also 6'5 w/ a 6'8 wingspan.  He's gonna have to bulk up to handle shooting guards but that kind of size advantage against point guards in particular (coupled with his athleticism and consistent effort) helped make up for his lack of NBA ready defense.  He improved drastically over the season and looked solid against point guards.  He has the potential to be a good NBA defender, but he'll need to work on it a great deal to be more than slightly above average.  If he does have to play a lot of SG (likely w/ russel) it'll be interesting to see how he adjusts."

lakers,3cqtpv,scootify,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:25:43 2015 UTC,I'm ok with any of these. Possibly Datome?
lakers,3cqtpv,flea61,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:50:51 2015 UTC,Alonzo Gee? the GOAT??
lakers,3cqtpv,SPMrFantastic,3,Fri Jul 10 08:31:18 2015 UTC,Ridnour?
lakers,3cqtpv,TheRealMelvinGibson,5,Fri Jul 10 03:59:10 2015 UTC,Would Upshaw account for any of that? If not.. Michael Beasley. He balled out for Miami last year. We could throw him at 2nd or 3rd string SF.
lakers,3cqtpv,badguymatt,4,Fri Jul 10 01:09:28 2015 UTC,"Overall, I'm for this, but to play devil's advocate, do you want Beasley, who has a history with the ganja, influencing Upshaw, who had issues with it in college?"
lakers,3cqtpv,soy714,2,Fri Jul 10 02:09:18 2015 UTC,"I think Beasley's proved at this point he's past it. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't be shocked to hear he still smokes, but it doesn't seem like it's any longer an issue.   Upshaw seems like he's truly trying to fight to earn his place in the league   I wouldn't avoid the signing of Beasley simply because he smokes though."
lakers,3cqtpv,badguymatt,3,Fri Jul 10 03:22:00 2015 UTC,This is an interesting idea that I am not completely against
lakers,3cqtpv,SSD65,2,Fri Jul 10 01:11:52 2015 UTC,Beasley is a great idea and I've always really wanted him.  If Upshaw got signed I assume it would be the minimum and that wouldn't eat into our cap space I believe.
lakers,3cqtpv,harryhov,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:15:48 2015 UTC,No..Upshaw is an undrafted rookie. The MLE can be used for someone on the holdout. A Dorrell Wright would be nice.
lakers,3cqtpv,TheRealMelvinGibson,0,Fri Jul 10 01:11:54 2015 UTC,Hell yeah. We need Beasley and Beasley needs Kobe. I've been saying this for too long.
lakers,3cqtpv,Donkeykongalan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:58:16 2015 UTC,Thought we had the other exceptions too. Got to have a small forward. Jabari can back up Clarkson and Lou Williams can back up Russell or something to that effect. Plus Hibbert dropped his trade kicker. But we usually only keep 14 guys on roster so even if we did have a few exceptions would they use them.
lakers,3cqtpv,VladDracul_III,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:31:44 2015 UTC,"Is nick young signed on or is he a FA? Because otherwise he can be traded and that extra 2.8m can help us acquire a good backup sf.  The other option is to keep nick young at sf to back up what is sounding like Kobe at starting sf. However, what would the 2.8 go to?"
lakers,3cqtpv,jaysteezy24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:58:21 2015 UTC,"We don't need to use the room exception on a 3rd string point guard, but I think a 3rd string point guard for the vets minimum would help us, because if Clarkson or Russell goes down you can't expect Lou Williams to play point guard. He is a shooting guard. But for the 2.8 million room exception I like Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, he adds defense to a team with a lot of defensive question marks. We have lots of young players that have the tools to be good defensively, but I think bringing in a guy that is a known defender will be good for their development."

lakers,3cqtpv,harryhov,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:30:33 2015 UTC,"I think it was a mistake to let Wes Johnson go. If anything, he could've been a nice backup SF for Kobe who can glide down for some fast breaks."
lakers,3cqtpv,rejectx,8,Fri Jul 10 01:10:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree, while Wes isn't complete trash he doesn't have future here, giving our rookies playing time to develop is way better than having Wes another for year. I am not against trying out some new faces though."
lakers,3cqtpv,GirthyAfghan,3,Fri Jul 10 01:15:33 2015 UTC,"I think you're right. We need studs, solid role players, or people with huge potential. Unfortunately that means we let go of guys like Johnson and Ellington."
lakers,3cqtpv,harryhov,2,Fri Jul 10 01:29:28 2015 UTC,Who do u suggest? We can use a SF?
lakers,3cqtpv,GirthyAfghan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:58:42 2015 UTC,Not really many options left. I'd like A Brown play some minutes behind Kobe but he's probably going to share that time with Swaggy.

lakers,3crhfx,xPenguinHD,9,Fri Jul 10 04:37:59 2015 UTC,"He is a great 20 minute player. If he gets more time than that, he will disappear."
lakers,3crhfx,ControlAgent13,6,Fri Jul 10 05:14:33 2015 UTC,"Inconsistent. You'll get some 17-11 games from him as often as games he just doesn't show up.  For your sake I hope he cuts back on the mid range shots. Decent post player and finisher, but not elite."
lakers,3crhfx,PatronSaintOfUpdog,5,Fri Jul 10 04:51:11 2015 UTC,"He fell in love with the mid range shot last year, shot too many jumpers. But his main game is hustle and energy"
lakers,3crhfx,_FreshG,2,Fri Jul 10 04:44:53 2015 UTC,"Really good energy player, not a great starter but okay. When he's not tired he can get offensive rebounds all day. He's also gotten really good with his mid range set shot. Not the best defensive player. If you have a good plan for a front court rotation and are decently deep, he should be a good player for you."
lakers,3crhfx,megavino,2,Fri Jul 10 04:45:07 2015 UTC,"Lots of energy and hustle, but can't play for too long. Just keep his minutes lower and he will be good."
lakers,3crhfx,thabizznezz,2,Fri Jul 10 04:58:23 2015 UTC,"Fell in love with long 2 last year, and even shot some 3s. But his main game is the energy garbage man. Get him to shoot less jumpers and play his normal game and hit the occasional jumper and you got yourself a solid rotational big man off the bench."
lakers,3crhfx,jaysteezy24,2,Fri Jul 10 05:42:55 2015 UTC,"He's at his best when he's a hustle/energy player coming off the bench playing around 18 minutes a game. Any more than that and he kinda floats around. Also he fell in love with taking long 2's, and got away from the energy that made him a joy to watch. Average defender."
lakers,3crhfx,BayStyles,2,Fri Jul 10 06:58:23 2015 UTC,Top 5 offense rebounder in the league. Even higher possibly. Could be a top off the bench guy too BUT don't start him or let him play over 30 mpg. He becomes pretty bad after that
lakers,3crhfx,Scabandiri,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:10:23 2015 UTC,"You guys got a good player. Seems to improve every year. He works hard, hustles. When someone goes up for a dunk, and everyone's running away scared to be the guy on the poster, hill will go chest to chest with the guy and contest the dunk."
lakers,3crhfx,SlightlyRyan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:52:15 2015 UTC,"I hope you like long 2's as much as J. Chill does, cause god damn does that boy love some long mid-range jumpers. That being said, he'll hit 'em. He's a very serviceable big-man offensively. He'll also fight to secure rebounds.   To add to that, he's a great team guy and has a very fun personality. I think Larry Bird is gonna like him.   His weaknesses would definitely be his defense. You don't want him to be your primary rim protector because he will get out-muscled and out-worked in the paint. He also goes through pretty quick flashes of hot and cold streaks throughout the season."
lakers,3crhfx,badguymatt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:54:05 2015 UTC,"good offensive rebounder, hustle and energy type of guy has improved his range a bit since the Lakers acquired him a few years back. but he was inconsistent with it  overall, a very solid role player, and one that should be able to contribute on a good team if given the minutes"
lakers,3crhfx,NicDwolfwood,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:06:44 2015 UTC,"Underrated, will always give 110% on both ends of the floor, great hustle player, great offensive rebounder, can knock down a 20 footer consistently, can finish in the post, reserved, doesnt complain about calls. He's really a great player and I wish him the best."

lakers,3cppra,taker98sp,10,Thu Jul 9 19:58:10 2015 UTC,"He's a good guy and has some solid skills but he struggles to consistently put it together. He had a couple strong nights starting in Kobe's absence but with so much opportunity to showcase his scoring he came up a little short. Not as good as Jodie Meeks imo, idk if that helps.  Strengths: outside shooting, hard worker, team player  Weaknesses: consistency, perimeter defense, size"
lakers,3cppra,clnsdabst,12,Thu Jul 9 20:45:29 2015 UTC,"Wayne is a really good pick up man, he's a great shooter. And out going guy. If you leave him open hell make you pay, and also attacks the basket good he's a good pick up honestly"
lakers,3cppra,ILikeChocolateMilkk,7,Thu Jul 9 20:05:17 2015 UTC,"I was kinda hoping we'd bring Wayne back this season. He's proven that he can step up off the bench and score when he's needed to. If you leave him open he's gonna fire one.   He'll never be a 6MOTY candidate in his career, but he's a solid late FA period snag, that's for sure."

lakers,3cppiv,hoverbikes,0,Fri Jul 10 00:11:17 2015 UTC,"Kobe at SF is sooo awkward. Wing players have to be good defensively. Kobe is gonna get blown by at his age. If Brandon Bass can shoot 3's and defend the wing, maybe we can put him at the 3 instead of Kobe.   Lou should strictly play the 6th man. It's what he's best at and even he knows it. Bring him in for pure scoring sporadically every quarter.   I think the starting lineup should be  PG: DLoad  SG: Kobe  SF: Bass (?)  PF: Randle  C: Hibbert  Off the bench:  Lou, Clarkson, Young, Nance, Brown, Black, Upshaw, Sacre"
lakers,3cppiv,BABYPUBESS,3,Thu Jul 9 23:03:47 2015 UTC,"I think you're better off defensively putting Kobe at the 3 than at the 2.  If 3s are going to blow by Kobe, 2s are going to be even worse.

lakers,3cofre,rtrainer30,0,Fri Jul 10 04:30:18 2015 UTC,Lin is the greatest player to pick up a basketball.  End of discussion.  He will go down as the greatest Laker of all time.
lakers,3cofre,BABYPUBESS,13,Fri Jul 10 04:38:08 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say honestly because byron hardly let Jeremy play the way he wants and when he wanted it. During Preseason and the first 10 games or so laker fans were ecstatic because the Lin and eddavis pick n roll combo looked so natural and easy. and then the season realy kicked in and WE NEVER SAW IT AGAIN.  He's the type of guy who will get you back to back solo fastbreak layups in the beginning of the quarter. He's actually a very good spot up shooter and an all-round shooter. Honestly, he's a good PG. We just didn't use him because we were tanking so we started fucking ronnie price for 70% of the season. Granted Price was scrappy as fuck, but the dude couldn't shoot. Lin comes off the bench and would still get your 12/4/5"
lakers,3cofre,TuneHD,8,Fri Jul 10 04:30:17 2015 UTC,"That Lin-to-Davis PNR was so smooth. Not getting to see more of that was probably my biggest regret of last season, but I understand why now that both players are gone."

lakers,3cofre,TuneHD,37,Thu Jul 9 16:47:22 2015 UTC,"Inconsistency is one of his strengths.   But in all seriousness, he wasn't given much of an opportunity on the Lakers last season. He showed flashes of Linsanity, but it seemed like Byron Scott, tank commander, wanted to have Ronnie Price in the game as much as possible, limiting Lin's minutes. There's also some truth behind referees being racist in the calls that they make. Lin would get hammered on his way to the basket a lot, and there would be no call. Now if someone dared touch Prince James like that..."
lakers,3cofre,erizzluh,11,Thu Jul 9 15:47:57 2015 UTC,What does that have to do with racism? A lot of players get treated like that.
lakers,3cofre,likwidsage,2,Thu Jul 9 14:25:13 2015 UTC,Including Yao. Not saying it's all race but I think its also disingenuous to say race isn't a factor.
lakers,3cofre,metrofeed,0,Thu Jul 9 16:43:10 2015 UTC,Explain how it is a factor then. I'd love to see your basis for thinking refs don't give fouls specifically to Asians.
lakers,3cofre,BABYPUBESS,19,Thu Jul 9 20:31:18 2015 UTC,i don't think that last part has to do with racism as much as it has to do with superstar treatment.
lakers,3cofre,metrofeed,5,Thu Jul 9 20:47:02 2015 UTC,I agree with you. But Lin does get hit with some obvious fouls that aren't called.
lakers,3cofre,FaithInMe,6,Thu Jul 9 16:15:55 2015 UTC,"Your comment started off truthfully and rationally, but you really shouldn't throw around allegations of racism without any supporting evidence."
lakers,3cofre,sanjugo,11,Thu Jul 9 20:59:34 2015 UTC,"""We find -- even conditioning on player and referee fixed effects (and specific game fixed effects) -- that more personal fouls are called against players when they are officiated by an opposite-race refereeing crew than when officiated by an own-race crew. These biases are sufficiently large that we find appreciable differences in whether predominantly black teams are more likely to win or lose, based on the racial composition of the refereeing crew.""  http://www.nber.org/papers/w13206   Here's an older study on racial bias in NBA officials, and while it has definitely gotten better, if you watched Lakers games last year or Houstan the year before you'd know how poorly Lin is treated by the officials.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oQ-aTV2E-0  That's just a clip of Deandre Jordan leveling him last year. Things like this happen a lot with Lin."
lakers,3cofre,lolxddavid,7,Thu Jul 9 17:23:04 2015 UTC,"http://www.nber.org/papers/w13206   Fascinating paper, thank you for sharing. I didn't watch much of Lin when he played for Houston last year, but I did see approximately 1/3 of the Lakers games and I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, but I wasn't exactly looking for it either. Thanks again for providing linked evidence!"
lakers,3cofre,metrofeed,3,Thu Jul 9 17:37:38 2015 UTC,"Pros:   He is fast when running in a straight line.  He can drive the lane and finish with contact. Makes more blocks than the average point guard due to his height but nothing extremely crazy. Decent amount of steals. Spot up three point shooting is improving yearly.      Pick and Roll is his biggest strength.  If that guy the Hornets drafted is a good PnR player, then the Hornets got a bench that can put up solid numbers if him and Lin play together. A good locker room guy.  A good person overall.   Cons:   His defense is mediocre although it isn't for a lack of trying.  He has below average lateral quickness so when an opponent sets a pick on Jeremy, he has a tough time getting through.   Shaky handles when pressured.  Not very effective when off the ball.   Biggest weakness is consistency.  Tends to do bad in the second game of back to backs, more so than the average player.   He is a steal for the price the Hornets got him at.  His fans are kind of nutty so watch out for that."
lakers,3cofre,JAYDEA,-1,Thu Jul 9 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"What a conflicting post. You say that he's the best blocking PG with decent amount of steals, yet his defense is mediocre????  And about his lateral movements, they are fine. He is a great one on one defender but prefers to funnel the offense into another team mate for a block, this makes it looks like he's losing his man which is not the case.  In fact doing so puts him in a better position to collect the block for a quick getaway or cut through an offensive PnR by putting a sticky hand in there.  Lin simply couldn't fit in Scott's weird offensive sets, but neither could a lot of other players.    I'd say that last year was not a good indicator of Lin's performance because the Lakers were obviously trying to tank."
lakers,3cofre,FuriousFlex,3,Thu Jul 9 19:41:40 2015 UTC,Definitely inconsistency. One game he looks like a good starter and others he looks like a 3rd string PG. he strength is definitely attacking
lakers,3cofre,delscorch0,3,Tue Jul 14 20:19:35 2015 UTC,"If he could play the way he did in his best games all the time, he'd be an All-Star player.   But he can't.   So he's not.   Because of his ethnicity, personality, and educational and personal success, he has a lot of really passionate fans who overlook his shortcoming and blame his lack of sustained success on other people. They don't seem to realize that many talented players have had equally difficult obstacles and have found a way to overcome them, and until he is able to play at a high level consistently, he won't be an NBA starter.   A few of his passionate fans blame his lack of success on racism, which is ironic because the main reason they like Lin in the first place is based on his ethnicity. I don't doubt that being a very tiny minority in the NBA presents unique issues, but at the end of the day the league is predicated on individual success regardless of who you are and where you come from.  That said, he could flourish as the leader of your second unit if he is given a chance. He's very talented, seems to be an excellent person, and might be able to gel with the players and coach in Charlotte the way he wasn't able to elsewhere."

lakers,3cofre,manolo88,5,Thu Jul 9 14:59:53 2015 UTC,"Inconsistent is how he'll most be remembered. He'll have games where he puts up 20pts, and 2pts the next (not an exaggeration, this did happen). I feel as though Byron played Ronnie Price more because you knew what you were going to get. With Lin, it's a big question mark."
lakers,3cofre,toomanypumpfakes,5,Thu Jul 9 15:51:22 2015 UTC,"He's a great PnR player, but that's about it. Unless you pair him with a big man that can really use his PnR abilities to the fullest, he'll be useless. He's inconsistent offensive wise and he has average/maybe slightly above average ball IQ. Defense doesn't exist. At best he'll put up 15/6/3 for a few games then go to 6/8/2 for a few after that. His jump shot is mainly what's shaky, he's solid at driving to the hoop. He's a 6th man or 5th best starter player for a good team caliber player. Also expect the worst fanbase in the league to follow him. He literally gets tons of all star votes just for being Chinese, so you can expect how his fans act. When we benched him Lin fans were going crazy saying he's our best player and should start even when Clarkson was averaging 20ppg. They even dared to call our coaching staff racist when Clarkson is actually half Asian. All in all though, you guys got a steal by having him for 2million a year, he's worth I'd say 4-5million a year."
lakers,3cofre,StealthRUs,3,Thu Jul 9 15:14:33 2015 UTC,Inconsistency with his shot. Little to no defense. Decent at pick and roll. He is a 6th or 7th man at best. He should only be used for about 20 minutes a game.
lakers,3cofre,showtimeb,2,Thu Jul 9 16:40:11 2015 UTC,He's not a bad backup PG.  He's good at driving to the basket but doesn't get any calls ever. He's a good shooter if he's open. Good passer.  His problem is that he's very inconsistent. Also if he does something wrong his confidence gets destroyed. Give him too much playing time and he shows why he's bounced around the league.  He's good in limited minutes off the bench vs the other teams 2nd unit.
lakers,3cofre,sublime1123,2,Thu Jul 9 15:04:08 2015 UTC,"If he gets some freedom to play his way he's good. His shot is solid, not amazing, but he can hit a three off a kickout or even off the dribble if the defender goes under the pick and roll even though it's not his main weapon.  His biggest strength is running the pick and roll. He's great at finding bigs who roll hard to the basket and knows how to kick the ball out for threes as well. He can make layups and he drives to the hole aggressively. Not bad on D.  His main issue was struggling with confidence. If he's feeling good, he's a great point guard, but if he's off his game that day for whatever reason he can disappear at times. So if you guys give him consistent minutes and a defined role I think he can do well for you."
lakers,3cofre,mrgabe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"At $2 million/year, you guys got a steal.  You'll be very happy with him.  He's not a great defender, but he's not as bad as people say he is.  He's also greatly improved his 3-ball.  He struggles off the ball, though, so he might have to lead your second unit."

Like everyone said, he is very streaky; he has that ""do too much"" syndrome where if the team is down 5 to 10 points, his decision making becomes very suspect. He'll drunk drive down the lane and lead to turnovers. Appreciate the confidence, but when it happens for the 4th time, it becomes stress inducing."

The quality of PGs has risen so high that solid backup PG feels like a good definition for him now, especially for a bench unit that needs scoring help."

He was inconsistent but he also got inconsistent minutes and BS didn't allow him to play how he wanted. First half of the season he had to play with Kobe and play off ball for the most part which isn't his forte. His stats are deceiving and if Hornets use him correctly, he'll revamp yalls offense."

Brown PF - Randle, Black, Bass C - Hibbert, Upshaw, Sacre  Two of these players haven't been signed yet (Buycks and Upshaw) but it's believed the Lakers will sign them unless someone else wows them in summer league.  Ryan Kelly will likely be the one waived if they sign Upshaw which is why he isn't listed.  If Upshaw doesn't get signed, move Bass to Center and Kelly as PF.  Starting lineup is Russell, Clarkson, Bryant, Randle, Hibbert.  Clarkson will get rotated out for Williams and then Clarkson will cover PG so Russell can get a test.  Bryant will probably play some 2 so expect Nance Jr. and A. Brown to get plenty of minutes.  The players who will end up warming the bench until injuries:  D. Buycks, J. Brown, R. Sacre.  Russell and Clarkson will eat all the PG minutes leaving Buycks garbage minutes.  Williams and Young both are higher than Brown will be on the depth chart and neither are starters.

Start them both, play Clarkson till the 6 minute mark, Russell till the end of the first. Then Sit Russell, bring Clarkson back in. Play Clarkson the whole 2nd, bring Russell in at the 6 minute mark. Repeat in the second half. It gives the Lakers a point guard for all 48 minutes, and gives each player 36 minutes."

True floor spacing is a huge aspect, but I think he is going to get buried by our depth in the 4 position with all the players we have there, and I just think trading him to try and get wing help or a veteran point guard will be a better option.

lakers,3cr896,Buckelroo,3,Fri Jul 10 04:30:59 2015 UTC,"Witt the cap raise, there's no need to move him anymore along with Sacre. But not counting Tarik Black, there currently is 4 power forwards in the line up and I don't see him in the rotation."
lakers,3cr896,Buckelroo,2,Fri Jul 10 03:17:29 2015 UTC,Do you think he could find his groove at the 3? I just really think we could use a forward who can spread the floor.
lakers,3cm73b,unlimited2k,67,Thu Jul 9 00:11:42 2015 UTC,That was bullshit back then but this is some bush league shit.   If players think this crap is ok it will fuck up the league. Imagine if the Lakers got Durant next year but OKC pulled a stunt like this.  And props to the Mavs: they always go for it and their coach is amazing. I don't care about their fortunes but at least they go for it and don't tank.
lakers,3cm73b,yungJoc,31,Thu Jul 9 00:52:36 2015 UTC,"Impossible to think DJ's behavior is right. I wouldn't wish this on any team. Cubes is an ass, but this was flat out wrong. I'm still having trouble feeling sympathy for Cubes due to basketball reasons."
lakers,3cm73b,amarstan,10,Thu Jul 9 03:08:24 2015 UTC,I used to think the cubes was a big doucher but my dad actually spoke with him at a charity event my dads company was in. My dad approached him and Cuban was really friendly and spoke with my dad for more than an hr and joked like buddies
lakers,3cm73b,FaptainSparrow,5,Thu Jul 9 04:20:37 2015 UTC,Cuban seems really genuine and down to earth. He's my favorite personality on Shark Tank by far - always gives people solid advice even when he doesn't buy into their idea.
lakers,3cm73b,CROOKnotSHOOK,11,Thu Jul 9 05:33:46 2015 UTC,I'm sure he's a nice guy and means well. But he was still the face of the CP3 veto that sunk our franchise and created this mess.
lakers,3cm73b,amarstan,12,Thu Jul 9 05:32:09 2015 UTC,I would say Dan Gilbert's letter is the face of the CP3 veto.
lakers,3cm73b,joelee1711,5,Thu Jul 9 05:50:26 2015 UTC,Given how hypocritical the call for the veto was I'm fine with calling it two-faced.
lakers,3cm73b,amarstan,2,Thu Jul 9 06:37:42 2015 UTC,plenty of faces will fit on that pile of crap. the whole association had a big laugh over pulling bullshit on the Lakers.
lakers,3cm73b,krucz36,2,Thu Jul 9 07:14:23 2015 UTC,"don't tank   Uh, Marc Cuban said that if jordan doens't sign with them they are gonna tank..."
lakers,3cm73b,Belinder,0,Thu Jul 9 07:06:32 2015 UTC,"I don't blame the player. There was never any contract signed. If anything, I blame the media for blowing it up as a done deal. No leaks no problem. The CP3 Lakers thing was actually done. If I remember correctly, Kobe was arranging to pick up CP3 from the airport, lol."
lakers,3cm73b,happyadrian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"The media blew it up because DJ agreed to sign with the Mavs and had them commit $80 million so they couldn't sign anybody else. Regardless of what was covered, DJ went back on his word and was too much of a bitch to tell Cuban to his face or even answer a phone call/text. You don't blame the player for this? The fact that he wanted to stay with the Clips isn't the issue. The guy is bitch made, plain and simple. The rest of the Clips laughing about it on Twitter are also a bunch of cunts. DJ fucked the Mavs hard. Not to mention fucking Dirk, who he supposedly looked up to. How can you not blame the player in this situation?"
lakers,3cm73b,akeytoasafe,2,Thu Jul 9 21:44:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm seeing this more through a legal lens. Under general contract law, there is nothing binding someone who simply agreed to sign a contract. That's just a risk taken during negotiations which is probably why the Clippers teammates and Doc stayed with DJ through the night until a contract was actually signed. Similarly, the Clippers were probably put through a lot. They probably thought they had DJ the whole time until the Mavs talks which likely caused the Clippers to scramble like crazy in all directions.  Now in terms of public relations and business etiquette, I don't disagree with you that it was a bitch move by DJ. Was it solely his fault? Even then its been alleged that he was pressured/induced by the Mavs organization to accept over the weekend even though he didn't want to which is why he back on his word."
lakers,3cm73b,happyadrian,-1,Fri Jul 10 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"@yungJoc. Yep Adam Silver needs to step in here, DJ setting precedents like this isn't good for the league."

lakers,3cm73b,TheAsianMamba,44,Thu Jul 9 00:17:50 2015 UTC,Lol they can say whatever they want. They will always second in this city.
lakers,3cm73b,krucz36,37,Thu Jul 9 00:19:00 2015 UTC,Second? Hell no.   Lakers: 16 NBA championships  Dodgers: 6 World Series championships  Kings: 2 Stanley Cups  Galaxy: 5 MLS cups  Raiders: 1 Super Bowl Championship in LA  Fuckin clips don't even rate a mention. What the fuck they ever won

lakers,3cm73b,krucz36,4,Thu Jul 9 07:16:50 2015 UTC,Any time I get too bummed I think about the drought in the 90s and how it ended. They're just in a little readjustment right now. The fucking Lakers are the Lakers and the rest of the gang better keep their shit close.
lakers,3cm73b,sirsancho09,3,Thu Jul 9 07:23:24 2015 UTC,The Sparks have more titles than the Clippers.
lakers,3cm73b,furlreal,7,Thu Jul 9 19:20:15 2015 UTC,They have banners with pictures of people that are on their team. It makes me chuckle every time I think about it.
lakers,3cm73b,impactblue5,7,Thu Jul 9 05:32:03 2015 UTC,Lol. I don't get why Laker fans get pissed of at Clippers fans and their shit talking. We're too high a top the mountain to even acknowledge it. They'll always be second in the city.  80% of their fanbase are just a bunch of bandwagoners and the rest of their true fans I actually respect for sticking through all those losing years.
lakers,3cm73b,TheWizard77,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:10:30 2015 UTC,This is completely right.
lakers,3cm73b,TimeisIllmatic95,7,Thu Jul 9 13:12:04 2015 UTC,"Don't matter they still won't win a title w/ that roster. Spurs, Golden State, OKC will kill them."
lakers,3cm73b,impactblue5,2,Thu Jul 9 04:24:58 2015 UTC,Spurs for sure. They're gonna wreck the West.
lakers,3cm73b,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Thu Jul 9 06:11:59 2015 UTC,Yeah Spurs roster is so deep. They just picked up McCallum from Sacramento too. Very underrated pickup to replace Joseph.
lakers,3cm73b,MikeMcNorv,19,Thu Jul 9 08:41:10 2015 UTC,DJ returning isn't going to help them put one up either.. they're the 5th best team in the west.
lakers,3cm73b,Notalent13,14,Thu Jul 9 00:37:37 2015 UTC,"Normally, I'd agree, but did you fucking see how egotistical Mav's fans got over signing Jordan? It was insane, it was as if they had signed Lebron James and Stephen Curry.  No seriously, Fuck the Mav's."
lakers,3cm73b,krucz36,5,Thu Jul 9 02:42:45 2015 UTC,"I agree with both sides. Screw Mark Cuban and enjoy your continued historical irrelevance, clippers"
lakers,3cm73b,TheRealMelvinGibson,-2,Thu Jul 9 07:12:56 2015 UTC,You sound like a sensitive little pussy. The clippers have a good team. We don't. Does it really hurt your feelings when they point it out? Our time will come. This is theirs.   Edit: and go back to high school dude. Your grammar is awful. This is why I hate saying I'm a Lakers fan. Not cause we suck but because our fan base is dumb as fuck.
lakers,3cm73b,Remote95,41,Fri Jul 10 05:28:38 2015 UTC,"If it were any other team, I'd agree with you. I hate Mark Cuban, but he's the lesser of the two evils. The Clippers are a sad, pathetic, and disgraceful organization, and Deandre  is such a douche for creating all of this drama. His reputation is going to take a major hit after this is all done.   Why are the Clippers always the benefactors for this bush league bullshit? The veto, and now this Deandre drama. Total garbage."

lakers,3cm73b,dialup_sounds,7,Thu Jul 9 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"yes, Cuban actually helped block the trade... not sure why everyone on the Cuban/Dallas wagon.."
lakers,3cm73b,Sletts,-4,Thu Jul 9 05:38:31 2015 UTC,Because just because he unfairly didn't want us to get better doesn't mean we should stoop to his level. His unprofessional actions shouldn't punish Dirk by an equally if not more unprofessional action.
lakers,3cm73b,dialup_sounds,2,Thu Jul 9 06:32:16 2015 UTC,his non-actions were unprofessional. he didn't literally barricade his house. he just choose not to act when his cell phone rang.
lakers,3cm73b,Sletts,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:49:57 2015 UTC,"So letting his teammates tweet out ""neener neener"" pictures of chairs in front of doors and tents in the backyard is professional? Allowing this to go down this way was professional in any way? These are grown men making MILLIONS that we are talking about, any of this conduct in a real business setting would immediately destroy any credibility you have and you'd have lawsuits up the ass for it.  Listen, when you verbally accept an $80M max offer, you should have the decency to pick up the fucking phone and talk like a man to the person you are fucking over. This could have been Dan Gilbert and I still would think that Deandre is a fucking scumbag.  We shouldn't jump for joy when someone we hate gets fucked over in this sort of way. We should jump for joy when their team loses in the finals, or when their team loses a great player fair and square, etc.  This was just childish and while I'm happy DJ isn't playing for Cuban anymore he should still have been a man about it and the whole situation leaves a bad taste in my mouth.   And in the long run, DJ was going to play for either a team I hate or an owner I hate so there is no happy ending either way. This was just a horrible way to handle it."
lakers,3cm73b,dialup_sounds,-2,Thu Jul 9 18:01:02 2015 UTC,"i have trouble understanding why everyone is so worked up. unprofessional shit happens ALL the time. and late hour flip-flops happen a lot too, but they aren't usually made public like this."
lakers,3cm73b,Sletts,2,Thu Jul 9 18:02:52 2015 UTC,this doesn't happen ALL the time. I'm sorry but you're just plain wrong about that. Thanks for the downvotes though.
lakers,3cm73b,dialup_sounds,-1,Thu Jul 9 18:04:06 2015 UTC,"this does not, but unprofessional shit happens all the time. do you even read what people type?"
lakers,3cm73b,Sletts,0,Thu Jul 9 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that in 80+ million dollar business deals people regularly back out without letting their new partner know that they will no longer be their new partner and then they avoid their phone calls because they don't want to have to face them?  And not only that, but that stuff like this happens all the time? Sure, small unprofessional shit happens all the time. Hell, I'm on Reddit at work right now, that's probably unprofessional. But if you're telling me that unprofessional things happen much the way this has gone down, I don't believe you. Businesses would lose all credibility and be blacklisted for pulling a stunt like this.  So arguing that this isn't a big deal because ""unprofessional shit happens"" is incredibly short sighted, as the blanket term ""unprofessional shit"" can cover anything from wearing the wrong shirt to work one day to bribery."
lakers,3cm73b,dialup_sounds,-1,Thu Jul 9 19:27:25 2015 UTC,"Turkoglu did that, Elton Brand did that big time to the Clippers.. Emmanuel Sanders did it to the Kansas City Chiefs last year. Broncos and Elvis Dumervil. guys flip flop, verbal agreements don't stand, etc. Even teams do it, see what the Marlins did with Jose Reyes. breaking verbal agreements is unprofessional. dj was unprofessional. is it the end of the fucking world? only on reddit. fuck outta here with that casual sportsfan pitchfork shit.."
lakers,3cm73b,Sletts,0,Thu Jul 9 20:14:32 2015 UTC,"Again, you are arguing that this happens ALL the time and then saying a handful of the only times that I can recall it happening in recent decades.   This doesn't make what DJ is doing okay just because it has been done before. And if you're going to do it, at least stand up and take responsibility for it and SPEAK to the people you are fucking over instead of having your teammates turn it into a huge joke while you bury your head in the sand.  I stand by my statement that DJ was childish and unprofessional and has lost a lot of credibility. At least have the decency to talk to the owner that was about to give you an $80M contract."

I'm a Lakers fan and I love Kobe, but I'm tired of the same story every year: all these trade rumors that fall through and turn into the Lakers only signing wash-ups or bench players that become starters for the Lakers.  I mean, the players don't necessarily suck but the Lakers deserve stars.  But because Kobe doesn't make himself pliable enough to play with other stars, they're not interested and we're stuck with his aging, injured body, and not much else."

lakers,3cp200,kenn4000,12,Thu Jul 9 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"Miami - 100%.  If they do win, I look like a prophet. If they don't no one will remember I said this.   Alternatively, 23.56%. such a weird question man"
lakers,3cp200,afroarmadillo,11,Thu Jul 9 17:17:50 2015 UTC,"well assuming they're bring back everyone, then 0 percent.  even lebron and role players were able to stomp through the playoffs. seriously the east freaking sucks and has sucked since early 2000's"
lakers,3cp200,dalas3322,10,Thu Jul 9 17:17:09 2015 UTC,"The Cavs were down 2-1 to the Bulls and probably would have lost that series if Pau had not been injured.  The Cavs won games 4 and 5, in which Pau didn't play by a combined 7 points.  They will be the favorites next season as they should be, but they can lose."
lakers,3cp200,tangential_quip,3,Thu Jul 9 17:25:18 2015 UTC,The cavs were a tremendous corner 3 from LeBron away from being knocked out in the second round (they weren't coming back from 3-1. The Bulls will be in the mix as will the heat. Maybe the Wizards make the leap. The cavs are obviously the overwhelming favorite in a weak east but it's not as if the cavs are a freight train
lakers,3cp200,FreshDiamond,3,Thu Jul 9 19:27:40 2015 UTC,Like the odds of the Lakers making the playoffs.
lakers,3cp200,Shebalied,2,Thu Jul 9 18:03:56 2015 UTC,"I really hope the seeding works out so they have to face the bucks/ chicago/heat. Cavs are obviously better, but that is still going to be two physical series followed by a hopefully healthy heat team that could give them some trouble."

lakers,3ctrrt,Idol_Wiz,24,Fri Jul 10 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"Regardless of what happens to staple's center, it won't change the overall attitude about the clippers in LA. The clippers will never be taken seriously until they leave Los Angeles. Honestly, the franchise deserves its own fan base. Until then the clipper will continue to be treated like second-class citizens, because, I hate to break it to you, they are."
lakers,3ctrrt,Buckelroo,2,Fri Jul 10 18:45:52 2015 UTC,Yeah most Clips fans I know are from Anaheim/San Diego anyway. They might as well move down the road.
lakers,3ctrrt,CalmerThanYouAreDood,18,Fri Jul 10 20:54:47 2015 UTC,"The Forum is what will always be a huge part of Lakers history but the Staples Center is where we have such images as this.  If Ballmer intentionally buys the Staples Center and tries to freeze out the Lakers, I'd definitely care and just be really disappointed in the Clippers owner."

lakers,3ctrrt,Trebolations,6,Fri Jul 10 18:43:46 2015 UTC,"Is this really a rumor that is floating around? I heard a little of this a year ago and the rumor essentially stated that AEG is not actively looking to sell Staples Center (if they did it would be around $1 billion), but if they were to sell it they would require a joint purchase of the LA Kings as well. Steve Ballmer may be kind of crazy but he is a good business man. I don't see how he would really benefit from purchasing Staples Center. If I was him, getting another stadium built in LA would be first, moving the team would be second, and the last option would be to purchase Staples."

lakers,3ctrrt,Kermetheus,5,Fri Jul 10 20:13:40 2015 UTC,I feel like if Balmer tries to ostracize the Lakers at Staples Center he's just going to alienate the LA fan base from the Clippers...
lakers,3ctrrt,stevebeyten,2,Fri Jul 10 19:41:16 2015 UTC,"Money doesn't buy 16 championship banners. It will be our house until you guys manage to put a few of your own up there. Then, maybe we will share it? I can't say it will ever be your house though."
lakers,3ctrrt,Sletts,0,Fri Jul 10 18:59:44 2015 UTC,"Ballmer can do whatever he wants, as long as the Lakers are in LA, we'll be the city's team. Whether thats in Staples Center or not. But even Ballmer would be stupid to force the Lakers out of an arena if he bought it, and I'm sure he's smart enough to realize that the Clippers are 4th fiddle in LA sports (though I guess that's what he's trying to change)."

lakers,3cnatg,findingthekobeh0mer,30,Thu Jul 9 06:01:51 2015 UTC,"It is also pretty common knowledge that people don't Chris. Paul but no one ever brings it up. Not many people who have played with Kobe have said they didnt like it. Most are very complimentary of him post shaq era. Obviously Dwight didn't enjoy it, but other than that most of it comes from dumb fucks like Jared Dudley. People have always hated Kobe, first he was an 18 year old drawing comparisons to Jordan, then he was the guy who couldn't get along with shaq, then he was a rapist, then he was the guy that ran shaq out of town, then he was the guy who couldn't win without shaq, then he was the guy who had way more help then poor LeBron, then LeBron ran away to Miami with 2 other stars and Kobe became the guy people don't want to play with. It's all bullshit people love to hate Kobe always have always will."
lakers,3cnatg,FreshDiamond,15,Thu Jul 9 06:11:36 2015 UTC,Best part about it is that Dudley never even played with Kobe. He's just salty that Kobe lit his ass up in 2010.
lakers,3cnatg,arkansastraffic,3,Thu Jul 9 07:25:25 2015 UTC,It is also pretty common knowledge that people don't Chris. Paul but no one ever brings it up   how is it never brought up but also common knowledge?
lakers,3cnatg,erizzluh,2,Thu Jul 9 16:17:56 2015 UTC,It is brought up in passing but never used as ammunition to criticize Chris Paul
lakers,3cnatg,FreshDiamond,2,Thu Jul 9 17:10:16 2015 UTC,I think it's in relativity to the Kobe-hate. We definitely hear about it but its not sensationalized because nobody is arguing whether CP3 is the greatest player ever like the do with Kobe/MJ/Lebron.
lakers,3cnatg,Sletts,21,Thu Jul 9 17:10:40 2015 UTC,All I know is that if this happened to the Lakers I would flip the fuck out.  I didn't think it was possible to hate the Clippers more + DeAndre is scum.  Feel for the Mavs fans right now.
lakers,3cnatg,joelee1711,16,Thu Jul 9 06:07:24 2015 UTC,"Not only this, but now they have Paul the fucking rat Pierce. Can't wait for our young core to develop so that we can trash this team again"
lakers,3cnatg,Mantis-Toboggin,7,Thu Jul 9 06:21:47 2015 UTC,Fuck Mav's fans. Do you realize how much fucking gloating they were doing over getting DeAndre? It was like they had fucking signed Lebron James.
lakers,3cnatg,Notalent13,4,Thu Jul 9 06:15:57 2015 UTC,"That's part of what is so funny to me... All of this over--- DeAndre Jordan? No, not Michael Jordsn, DeAndre Jordan."
lakers,3cnatg,aveydey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:04:40 2015 UTC,Let's be honest with ourselves though DeAndre Jordan is a top three center in the NBA right now that's pretty fucking crucial
lakers,3cnatg,GabrielRodriguez115,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:53:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say top 3 - I'd put Anthony Davis, Marc Gasol, and Demarcus Cousins ahead of him in no particular order"

lakers,3cnatg,GabrielRodriguez115,2,Thu Jul 9 22:14:11 2015 UTC,"If anything, it would be more exaggeration to the notion that the Lakers aren't a force to be messed with in the league as far as franchises go even worse. I thought it was overblown now, but if something like this would to occur, some idiot at ESPN would compare the Lakers to the 76ers in terms of how the organization has been run.   The better question would be, if DJ did this to the Lakers, how the hell could he go back to the Clippers? He would have to go into witness protection."

lakers,3coe9h,Buckelroo,9,Thu Jul 9 14:04:16 2015 UTC,Relax. There's a reason why Green has been bounced around the league
lakers,3coe9h,p0se1d0n,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:29:22 2015 UTC,Yep and he was obviously looking for a contender based on that contract. No way he would consider the Lakers in the slightest. Not the FO's fault at all.
lakers,3coe9h,santokimilktea,3,Thu Jul 9 16:12:53 2015 UTC,"Wait you guys really wanted him? I mean I we already have Kobe, Lou and Swaggy. Why not look for another SF with a different kind of game?"
lakers,3coe9h,aveaou,0,Thu Jul 9 15:00:20 2015 UTC,Lou is 6'1. He's not in the sf rotation.
lakers,3coe9h,aveaou,2,Thu Jul 9 15:14:43 2015 UTC,"Thats not my point. They're all shoot-first kinds of players. I don't like the term, but they're all what people would call chuckers. We already got a lot of those on our team. There's only one ball to go around. I'm not ready to watch each of them take turns iso-ing while Russell and Randle stand around. I'd rather hope the Lakers are looking for a defender or a spot up shooter"
lakers,3coe9h,_Wi11,3,Thu Jul 9 15:26:48 2015 UTC,Dorrell Wright maybe? Since they signed Green maybe they decided not to reunite.

lakers,3coe9h,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,0,Thu Jul 9 20:31:35 2015 UTC,Jesus Christ we need to get at least somebody at the SF.
lakers,3coe9h,whiskeynrye,2,Thu Jul 9 14:16:43 2015 UTC,I think we drafted anthony brown for that reason.
lakers,3coe9h,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:20:09 2015 UTC,Obviously. But he's the only real SF we got.
lakers,3coe9h,aveydey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:30:53 2015 UTC,You've got to understand there aren't positions in the Princeton system.
lakers,3coe9h,arkansastraffic,2,Thu Jul 9 15:52:58 2015 UTC,That doesn't mean much when there isn't a single guy on the roster who can even somewhat guard LeBron or Durant (or even Tobias Harris or Kris Middleton).  They're all going to have career nights against us lol
lakers,3coe9h,aveydey,3,Thu Jul 9 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"I disagree strongly about Harris and Middleton and as for guys like Durant and Lebron, no shit.  Who can guard Lebron? Who can guard Durant? It's a short list.  Lakers are going to be fine playing 3 guards a forward and a center.  Isn't this the dream lineup that everyone on Reddit circle jerks over?  This is exactly what the Warriors are running, except for when they run 3 guards and 2 forwards, which I guarantee you will be seeing the Lakers do also.  Kobe has always been a G/SF this isn't new for him and it's actually a better position for him in his older age because there's less running than running point or playing off ball shooter."
lakers,3coe9h,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:30:32 2015 UTC,How many players can effectively guard LeBron and KD to begin with? Not many. With a guy like LeBron all you really gotta do is play team defense and keep him out of the paint. KD don't give him space and it helps to have a rim protector like Hibbert if he blows past you.
lakers,3coe9h,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:33:11 2015 UTC,"Kobe, Anthony Brown, Nance. I think that's enough."
lakers,3coe9h,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:36:24 2015 UTC,Two rookies and a player in his late thirties who hasn't played a full season in like 3 years? I get that we should develop our young guys but if we want to make an unlikely run at the playoffs then we need more depth.
lakers,3coe9h,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:02:43 2015 UTC,I mean I guess there's a possibility they could still add a veteran wing.
lakers,3cowim,lakersfan23,10,Thu Jul 9 16:22:26 2015 UTC,"I liked Wayne, but no, we didn't make a mistake.  This isn't a good place to develop as he'll never get minutes with Kobe/Swaggy/Clarkson/Russell/Louis."
lakers,3cowim,SpaceCowboy170,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:45:51 2015 UTC,"Aren't we getting rid of swaggy? I thought us getting Lou was a sign we were going to get rid of nick, they are the same player and nick is not necessary especially with his horrid defense. We need to get rid of nick and get an SF."
lakers,3cowim,DuncanDonuts32,3,Thu Jul 9 18:40:35 2015 UTC,"Lou Williams and Nick Young don't play the same position at all. The Lakers already need another guy on the wing and trading Nick makes it 2 guys instead of 1. I'm kind of surprised at the number of people that want to see him gone, but I'm not expecting the Lakers to trade him at all, and it certainly won't be just because. He's got a great contract for 3 more years. Sadly he took a huge pay cut to stay. Hard lesson learned for him unfortunately. Fans and organizations can turn on you in no time, don't take pay cuts."
lakers,3cowim,justsomeguy5,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:58:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Young can play the SF. The guy works his ass off to bring us wins and were ready to throw him out because we got another potential 6th man? I love the idea of young, Williams, and bass coming off the bench. If upshaw can develop and anchor a defense for a second unit, we have one of the dopest benches in the league."
lakers,3cowim,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:23:35 2015 UTC,"Probably, but he'd still be playing behind four other guards.  Young isn't gone and we don't need Ellington either way"
lakers,3cowim,SpaceCowboy170,4,Thu Jul 9 19:03:35 2015 UTC,"Nope. Gotta get rid of the journeyman type of guys.  And to purge our roster of the remnants from the past 2-3 years. Other than Kobe,Randle, and Clarkson of course."
lakers,3cowim,jaysteezy24,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:52:26 2015 UTC,That's such a silly mindset. These guys were starting when they're bench players. Why get rid of the guys we had developing?
lakers,3cowim,TuneHD,3,Thu Jul 9 23:48:58 2015 UTC,absolutely not
lakers,3cowim,wanderfound,3,Thu Jul 9 17:11:26 2015 UTC,No
lakers,3cowim,titanic_swimteam,2,Thu Jul 9 17:50:51 2015 UTC,"Hell no, getting rid of all those veteran players we brought in the past two seasons was the best thing we could do. I am sketchy however with the solid core of rookies we have."
lakers,3cowim,Misinformed_Larry,2,Thu Jul 9 17:53:45 2015 UTC,"he is decent player but he is a guard that is not a play maker we can't have him as back-up PG and we have Young (still), Lou, Kobe, Jabari, CLarkson, Russell who can play 2 for us, so no, we are extremely deep in that position."
lakers,3cowim,rejectx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:16:07 2015 UTC,Probably. We make a lot of mistakes.

I love /nba though and am on it more than any subreddit, because I love basketball. And everyone hates NBA, so I agree with you there that it is pretty pathetic.

He's got that burning inner desire to always improve, that ""chip"" on his shoulders that great players have.  In his exit interview, he said he watched the NBA draft at least 10 times, where he fell from the first round to the second round. That's pretty crazy, almost obsessive. He watches it as motivation, to keep himself both humbled and angry to prove all the other teams wrong for not picking him.  At the same time, he isn't some angry volatile guy, with false sense of bravado. You sense the dude is pretty calm and a good dude. A nice mix of fiery passion and level-headedness."

lakers,3cmfsk,Ray3142,39,Thu Jul 9 01:22:00 2015 UTC,"I wish him well, he's a solid backup and is a genuinely nice guy. Hopefully he can recover some of that Linsanity form."
lakers,3cmfsk,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,3,Thu Jul 9 01:37:16 2015 UTC,I think people have been saying hopefully he can return to Linsanity form for the last 3 years.
lakers,3cmfsk,isyourmomhot,4,Thu Jul 9 08:22:32 2015 UTC,"He still has to bring that dream... At this point he is a backup, a great backup .. Good for them."
lakers,3cmfsk,FuriousFlex,2,Thu Jul 9 02:46:02 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that Ginobili is a backup too. There is no shame for any player to play a backup role in this league. Every good team in this league needs a quality backup aka the 6th man in order for them stay competitive.
lakers,3cmfsk,hankliny,6,Thu Jul 9 03:35:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah but people understand that Ginobli, especially in his prime could start on any team. Lin is a backup because he's not good enough to be a quality starter"
lakers,3cmfsk,Kbmakaveli,8,Thu Jul 9 03:58:35 2015 UTC,"Lin is good enough to be a starter, it's just his inconsistent bouts that cause frustration for a team. He can dominate any Pick n Roll play with some caveats, in NY he shone with Novak and Chandler and with the Lakers he shone in bursts with Davis.  With some serious development he could reach that top 15/20 point guard status and be a solid starter and asset for any team. While I'm not irrational and don't think he can be an All Star caliber player, I don't think his peak is a back up point guard (though he'd certainly do very well in that position, energetic 6th man and all), I think he can very well be a great starter running the point alongside an actual star.  It's sad that Lin fanatics and haters alike were collectively drowning out any real discussion about his game."
lakers,3cmfsk,lmaonade200,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:35:00 2015 UTC,"With some serious development he could reach that top 15/20 point guard status   He doesn't need serious development, he just needs consistent play time.  He didn't get that with McHale or Byron. He did all he could for us, it's just he would've screwed up the tank."
lakers,3cmfsk,StealthRUs,2,Thu Jul 9 14:39:11 2015 UTC,"We will see about that. Jeremy was just a really bad fit for Byron's offense. Jeremy made his fame playing PnR and here with the Lakers, our coach claims that PnR stops ball movement. I know what I'm about to say sounds very LOFish, but I am really not one of those irrational Lin troopers. I don't think Jeremy was allowed to play his game here with the Lakers. Byron made that comment about PnR when Jeremy was on a hot streak last season playing loads of PnRs. I believe it was in the beginning of January, then Jeremy got injured, we focused on developing Clarkson instead."
lakers,3cmfsk,hankliny,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:14:57 2015 UTC,He was bad for the tank! ...seriously who gets benched after going 48%/37 3pt%/85ft% for the first month...Jeremy Lin (After Lakers realized they weren't making the playoffs)
lakers,3cmfsk,jonstarks,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:57:32 2015 UTC,"After Lakers realized they weren't making the playoffs   They should've known that going into the season.  Once they weren't able to move him in a deadline deal, he got benched."
lakers,3cmfsk,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:37:51 2015 UTC,"well, they probably didn't know Kobe and Swag were going to shoot 39% and take 35 shots a game...and that's only for November...they shot worst for the entire season."

lakers,3cmfsk,MikeMcNorv,2,Thu Jul 9 01:27:57 2015 UTC,"well, is there anything that would make sense for the Lakers to S&T Lin to Charlotte for?"
lakers,3cmfsk,lmaonade200,2,Thu Jul 9 01:29:03 2015 UTC,"I think the Hornets have the cap to sign Lin in the first place so they don't need a S&T, Lin is unrestricted so they can just straight up offer a contract to him"
lakers,3cmfsk,itsyourdestini,8,Thu Jul 9 06:25:04 2015 UTC,I feel bad for the Hornets fan who just want root for their team. Godspeed Lin
lakers,3cmfsk,jonstarks,3,Thu Jul 9 03:23:38 2015 UTC,He's a borderline starter/6th man...Kemba better get that shooting % up
lakers,3cmfsk,kobe_bryant24,0,Thu Jul 9 06:53:12 2015 UTC,basketball is more than shooting percentage.
lakers,3cmfsk,jonstarks,0,Thu Jul 9 13:44:34 2015 UTC,"Of course ""Kobe_bryant24"" its about shooting 37% on 20 shots for you can still call yourself a ""20ppg"" scorer in this league."
lakers,3cmfsk,bich19,3,Thu Jul 9 22:19:23 2015 UTC,so jlin chose hornets because of the mavs-deandre situation. i really believe mavs gives him the best fit and opportunity.
lakers,3cmfsk,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:41:17 2015 UTC,The Mavs didn't want him once DJ stayed.  The Mavs are supposedly going to tank for top 7.

lakers,3cmfsk,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:36:29 2015 UTC,No thanks he has too many off the court issues. If anything we should get Troy Daniels. You can never have too many shooters.
lakers,3cmfsk,WhiteKidMAADCity,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:49:47 2015 UTC,If we're trading Young somewhere else (which I don't really want us to do) I wouldn't mind getting Troy Daniels or PJ Hairston
lakers,3cmfsk,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:39:07 2015 UTC,You're like the first person I've seen who wants to keep Young. He had a bad year but people are forgetting how well he played for us in the past.
lakers,3cmfsk,WhiteKidMAADCity,2,Thu Jul 9 02:25:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I don't think it's fair to judge him based off a year where he was injured a lot and we were tanking"
lakers,3cmfsk,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:38:28 2015 UTC,"When he dropped 30 and people were angry that he gave us meaningless wins. Fast-forward to this season, we desperately need more losses and Nick Young plays like ass, then people get angry at him for playing bad, dude can't win lol. We should be praising him for helping the tank."
lakers,3cmfsk,arkansastraffic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:41:26 2015 UTC,"Said it before and I'll say it again: I think Nick would be a great 3 and D guy off the bench. Very underrated defender, and even though he's more of a shooting guard, he's played the three two years in a row for the Lakers. What's interesting is that he played less 3 this previous season than the season before (where he played much better)."
lakers,3cmfsk,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:53:27 2015 UTC,"Dude is so underrated on his defense. He's crazy athletic and has long arms, when he's locked in he's solid. He unfortunately doesn't lock up very often because he'd rather use his energy on offense."
lakers,3cmfsk,arkansastraffic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:34:12 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think all this trade talk is motivating him just a little. We all know he doesn't want to be traded to Charlotte or something.  There's still room for him on this team. Byron just needs to tell him that his focus shouldn't be to carry the bench squad anymore (especially with the addition of Lou and Bass). He can still hit crazy, flashy shots, just no more jacking them up unnecessarily. At this point I think he's willing to accept any role to stay haha"

lakers,3cmfsk,howdoesilogin,-3,Thu Jul 9 04:11:05 2015 UTC,Lin will get so much playing time behind Kemba in charlotte they might as well stick around here.
lakers,3cmfsk,ScimitarLord,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:13:20 2015 UTC,Why would he go there to play off the bench instead of playing for the Mavs as a starter with a solid team (especially with DJ)?
lakers,3cmfsk,ScimitarLord,8,Thu Jul 9 06:13:19 2015 UTC,"because if the hostage situation in Houston plays out the way it looks like it will, Mavs aren't getting DJ."
lakers,3cmfsk,DA40_in_the_rough,2,Thu Jul 9 01:36:45 2015 UTC,yea but didn't think he was the guy to be content playing bench when there is a starter position open
lakers,3cmfsk,howdoesilogin,4,Thu Jul 9 01:38:55 2015 UTC,Most likely the Mavs haven't been pursuing him hard in the past week because they were focused on DJ.  They probably didn't even make an offer yet.  He went where he felt wanted.
lakers,3cmfsk,FuckTheClippers,2,Thu Jul 9 02:30:23 2015 UTC,long story short because he's not good enough to start in the NBA as he has proven time and time again. He just got Ronnie Price money to be a bench player on an eastern conference lottery team ffs.

lakers,3cmdxb,dood23,2,Thu Jul 9 01:54:41 2015 UTC,"Seriously. What would either the Pacers or Mavs gain from this? Would Hibbert make Dallas good enough to win the title or be someone they could build around? Highly doubtful. And since the Mavs draft pick goes to Boston next year unless it's in the top 7, why would Dallas want to be just marginally better? As for Indy, what would they get in addition to Ellis (who they are already getting) that's better than the Lakers 2nd round pick? Why would Dallas look to top the Laker offer for Hibbert? Giving up more draft picks for Hibbert doesn't make sense for Dallas.   Then in addition to all the basketball reasons for why this doesn't make sense both the Pacers and Mavs would look just as bad as DJ does for no real reason."

The sign and trade made a lot of sense if it would help get a commitment from Ellis, but they already have that.  So now they are looking at whether they want Ellis and whatever else would get thrown in the deal, or Ellis and what the Lakers have to offer in the deal.  Sure they could do a deal with the Mavericks, but they will easily end up with more assets by doing one with the Lakers, which is especially true if they want a player back from the Lakers."

Every team in the league had about two chances to draft him and passed, including the Lakers.  Look, if he's good enough to make The Defenders squad, we should be happy. But he's a project. Nobody is coming to pry an undrafted FA away from us. Let the Upshaw hype die.   The Mavs chose an Indian guy suffering from Gigantism, who'd never played competitive basketball before in the second round. The guy hadn't played in college or overseas.

He is saying all the right things right now since Lakers are the only ones to give him a shot. Do not underestimate Cuban's sliminess. You don't get to become a billionaire playing nice.
lakers,3cmmvh,Symphonia1,4,Thu Jul 9 06:14:52 2015 UTC,"I like the idea, but I don't think Mitch and them would pull the trigger, hopefully he realizes that being around a bunch of high character guys that he's getting to know is best for him, he'll also get nice PT and a chance to earn a starting role. He already said he likes the Lakers, hopefully he appreciates us being the ones to give him a chance and in return gives us a chance to sign him"
lakers,3cmmvh,Notalent13,2,Thu Jul 9 02:45:58 2015 UTC,"We should offer him a contract regardless of anything else, hes got too much upside to not get a legitimate peak at how he performs in the NBA.  Not like we can't give him one of those bullshit non guaranteed contracts the 76'ers and Rockets have been using on second rounders."
lakers,3cmmvh,santokimilktea,2,Thu Jul 9 03:28:51 2015 UTC,Upshaw WANTS to be in LA.  And no it's not me being a cocky homer. It's the fact that we suck and it's in his best interest to join a team where he can increase his NBA stock. Lakers are a good team to be on for a young player trying to show his worth.

lakers,3cms2d,FuriousFlex,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:42:06 2015 UTC,"idk, their pick is top 7 protected. They might try and make the playoffs by figuring if they get Roy Hibbert they can pair him w. Dirk."
lakers,3cms2d,lakers__sad_summer,-1,Thu Jul 9 08:09:04 2015 UTC,"With just Dirk, Parson, and D-leaguers, they can make top 7, pretty easily.    But I hope they change their mind and decide that top 7 is too risky and try to get Hibbert.  I don't want Hibbert on the Lakers."
lakers,3cms2d,StealthRUs,13,Thu Jul 9 14:23:29 2015 UTC,i hope we dont go this route. we arent bitches. I think we just go blow the roster up and tank. Seeing Dirk go down like this is gonna suck

lakers,3cms2d,_im_on_acid_,5,Thu Jul 9 04:13:11 2015 UTC,"He is not a free agent so we can't sign him, we are trading for him.  It's up to the Pacers, if they get an offer they like better from the Mavs then there unfortunately isn't anything stopping them"
lakers,3cms2d,RemoteClancy,7,Thu Jul 9 03:25:25 2015 UTC,"Unlike a player reneging on a verbal agreement, there's likely a great deal of social/institutional pressure keeping GMs from doing the same. The primary one being that your word would be garbage with your peers (the ones you'd need to make trades with in the future). What would keep the Pacers from working out a trade for Hibbert with the Mavericks is the rest of the league recognizing that Bird's not to be trusted as a trade partner."
lakers,3cms2d,megavino,7,Thu Jul 9 04:06:49 2015 UTC,"What I'm worried about is we haven't really heard the deal was ever done. they said assets needed to be sorted out. Idk, I'll be alot more happy when its officially announced lol"
lakers,3cms2d,wanderfound,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:21:05 2015 UTC,I sure hope so.
lakers,3cms2d,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:56:48 2015 UTC,"This is all very true, but I think Hibbert has more power in this situation and could force his way to Dallas, if they want him.  He has a $2 million trade bonus that would count against our cap, he would have had to waive it to allow a trade to the Lakers because we reached the cap by signing Lou and had no intention of ever paying it.  If the Mavs make an offer for Hibbert and will pay his tade bonus, Hibbert could opt for the extra money and force his way to the Mavs."
lakers,3cms2d,harryhov,3,Thu Jul 9 04:48:24 2015 UTC,"Truth be told, if I were Hibbert, I would much rather play in LA than Dallas at this point. Selfless rookie backcourt vs. whoever Mavs pickup for their backcourt? C'mon now."
lakers,3cms2d,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:34:24 2015 UTC,"la is clearly the better basketball destination, but an extra $2mil in a state with no income tax vs one where he'll be paying 13% is a big difference.  It doesn't sound like its the case for Roy, but for some people that's just too much money to be leaving on the table"
lakers,3cms2d,flea61,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:28:30 2015 UTC,Actually with the cap jumping to $70 million I believe we can absorb Hibbert's trade kicker without unloading more salary.
lakers,3cms2d,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:23:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unless we quickly sign someone before.  I'm cool with getting Hibbert, but paying him that much extra with getting assets or cash just seems unnecessary when he was shown the door in Indy."
lakers,3cms2d,flea61,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:30:26 2015 UTC,Oh we don't actually pay him the extra $2.3 million. It affects our cap space but comes out of Indiana's pocket.
lakers,3cms2d,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:34:16 2015 UTC,"Ahh.  To be honest though I'm not really concerned with the Lakers bottom line (they'll still make plenty of money even if they have to pay Hibbert that extra $2mil).  That extra $2mil on our cap space could be put to a lot better use, even if we don't go out and sign someone starting the season under the cap has it's advantages."
lakers,3cms2d,GeorgeLovesBOSCO,2,Thu Jul 9 16:17:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Roy's not a free agent. Its totally up to the Pacers what they decide to do if the Mavs approach them. I think the best to do is hold Larry Bird hostage until he trades him to us."
lakers,3cms2d,harryhov,4,Thu Jul 9 03:49:47 2015 UTC,Mitch better have him locked in a room and signed 9:01pm Pacific.
lakers,3cms2d,PineCreekCathedral,10,Thu Jul 9 03:10:36 2015 UTC,"It's not up to Hibbert, he's already under contract with the Pacers.  This is strictly a trade."

lakers,3cms2d,arkansastraffic,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:14:54 2015 UTC,What can the Mavs offer? S&T with Monta to send Roy to the Mavs? Maybe throw in a second-rounder to make it slightly more attractive than the Lakers' offer?  I just don't think anything extra they can give would be enough for Bird to go back on his word. Hibbert is coming to L.A.
lakers,3cms2d,dalas3322,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:22:50 2015 UTC,"they might go after him, with all dirk has done i doubt they want to just completely tank.  also they still have parsons and wes who are both solid players"

lakers,3crm8i,TheAsianMamba,4,Fri Jul 10 05:29:56 2015 UTC,"The Mav's have no assets of any value. So no, we will not and should not be trading Hibbert, especially since outside of Hassan Whiteside there is not a better FA option next year and there is absolutely no guarantee we can sign him out from under the Heat or another team that wants him.  So, if we are to trade Hibbert, we need a solid center prospect in return, or we need Upshaw to be going nuts, even then we need something of real value."
lakers,3crm8i,Notalent13,4,Fri Jul 10 05:32:48 2015 UTC,Unless they are willing to give us drik and parsons for hibbert than nah I'm good ... Hibbert is a decent center that actually plays d

lakers,3cnpnt,Notalent13,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:08:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not seeing it anymore tbqh. No one wants him, and no one really needs to dump cap anymore. Hes going to be a Laker this year, at least until the trade deadline."
lakers,3cnpnt,lars5,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:11:22 2015 UTC,"cap got bumped up to $70M so no need to shed his salary, and if you move him you need a decent young wing in return to back up kobe, which isn't a likely trade scenario."
lakers,3cnpnt,Theoryman101,3,Thu Jul 9 10:51:33 2015 UTC,"Nance was drafted to be a small forward.  The fact he can play power forward as well makes him a nice fit for the Princeton offense.  He was defensive player of the year for Wyoming.  Lakers scouted him more than most teams did and secured him early to ensure they got their man.  Which caught a lot of analysts by surprise since there wasn't much info on Nance and he was expected to go late in the second round.  His combine stats say he's a 37"" vertical.  Lakers workout had him at 43"".  Which is a big difference.  You can actually see the plan the Lakers have for their starting five in a couple years.  Look at their rookies and second years:  PG - Russell  SG - Clarkson  SF - Nance Jr.  PF - Randle  C - Upshaw PG - Buycks  SG - J. Brown  SF - A. Brown  PF - Black   Then you realize they signed a 6th man of the year guy in Lou Williams and a former all-star defensive center in Roy Hibbert.  Hibbert was a bad fit for the Pacers but he's a good fit for the Laker's Princeton offense.  Now that he's injury free and in a better team environment, expect him to have a good year and get a nice contract from the Lakers at the end of the year."
lakers,3cnpnt,hitmanrva10,2,Thu Jul 9 17:29:25 2015 UTC,"he's basically the next blake griffin, but not really."
lakers,3cnpnt,Donkeykongalan,2,Thu Jul 9 14:16:49 2015 UTC,He's like RKelley but he's extremely athletic and plays defense and there's no way we can feel sorry for RKelley next to a guy like Nance when Nance takes his spot. Bass might take off next year and Nance will still be here. Nance is the small ball guy we want because he's got the offense and defense. The way we drafted was to go with the gsw mold and Nance fits it more than Bass. Bass has a really good percentage from 16 out to the 3 but has maybe shot 5 3's in his career. We could have traded the pick. Nance is on the payroll and one of our 15 guys. My question is if Kelley gets waved now. One can hope.  Oh and Anthony Brown and Nance are both 4 year guys so we're looking from help from our picks asap.
lakers,3cnpnt,jaysteezy24,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:29:31 2015 UTC,Hes still a rookie. I don't think he gets much rotation minutes next year and might see a lot of stints in the dleague because of our depth at the 4. In no way can he play the 3 just yet. Floor spacing will be crippled because his jump shot isnt all that great yet. Hopefully he can become that versatile defender for us in the future but don't expect too much his rookie year.

lakers,3cms2v,dalas3322,5,Thu Jul 9 03:46:17 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, and I'll say it again, Dwight handled his post-Lakers free agency like a professional.  He met with teams, he waited a few days to think about his decision, then he announced his decision.  Everything else that happened during the period was rumors, sources, and speculation bullshit.  Now his last two years on the Magic... that was shady.  But at least he learned from it and Lebron's free agency."

lakers,3clw4e,sunstersun,2,Thu Jul 9 04:24:29 2015 UTC,"This is why I'm really high on Clarkson.  Last season when the team was losing a lot, you could see it was affecting him. He HATES losing. He probably knew that the overall plan was to tank but he was still fighting hard for the win every game with the opportunity he was given. Remember that late season game in Philly that the Lakers won because he refused to give up (scrapped for the offensive board and got fouled)? Did you read the Player's Tribune article detailing how he lamented missing the give me layup in the middle of the Christmas game?  He takes this all personally. Being drafted late, being traded for cash considerations, watching the team lose from the bench, not being able to lead the team to more wins...all of it. He has a killer mentality and chip on his shoulder. He wants nothing more than to win, and the work he has and will continue to put in during this offseason will be apparent soon enough. Him and Kobe are cut from the same cloth, and it's clear that Kobe has taken a liking to him for that reason.  That isn't to say that Clarkson is going to become a superstar, but he certainly has the right attitude for it and there is at the very least a lot of promise and potential. I really think this kid is going places and will help bring the Lakers back into contention sooner rather than later."
lakers,3clw4e,arkansastraffic,8,Thu Jul 9 12:51:30 2015 UTC,"I like that he's slowly getting more comfortable speaking up. Ultimately, as the article states, he's more a lead-by-example type, which I respect. I think Russell is someone who has the talking and media game down, clearly extroverted while JC is introverted. But that dynamic could really work to our favor; probably won't have many internal conflicts or anything.   I really like all of our young guys, especially the top 3 - Randle, JC, and Russell. Hopefully this is a core that can grow together for many years to come."
lakers,3clw4e,Citizen_of_Atlantis,5,Thu Jul 9 00:59:53 2015 UTC,This is why I'm high on JC and I'm praying D'angelo and him pan out to become the next CP3/Mike Conley

lakers,3cm08j,hypercoolemia,15,Wed Jul 8 23:17:31 2015 UTC,D'Angelo said this himself as well.. It's hard to temper your expectations with all these great comparisons.   We'll find out on Friday!
lakers,3cm08j,kanyetwittykitty,17,Wed Jul 8 23:24:02 2015 UTC,"Steph Curry was nowhere this good when he was drafted.   He was always an amazing shooter. But the passing game and ability to finish at the rim was something he really developed in the NBA. Same thing with his defense.   Not to mention, Curry's athleticism was frequently criticized prior to the draft. People asked whether he would basically just be a spot up shooter for his career (Kyle Korver type).  This is part of the reason Minny made the stupid decision to draft two PGs in a row ahead of him (Rubio/Flynn).   So, out of college they are very similar to each other. The difference being that Curry was a better shooter and Russell a better passer. Now it just comes down to health and what's between the ears."
lakers,3cm08j,amarstan,10,Wed Jul 8 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"I agree that Curry is a much closer comparison than Harden. It's just easier to see Harden cause he's a lefty and they're the same height. But, his game resembles Curry's much closer. Revolves around the jumper, he can use it to get to the rim, but his biggest scoring threat is definitely the 3-point shot. Russell might have better vision than Curry, he's longer too. And although Russell obviously isn't likely to become as great a shooter as Curry, he's a damn good shooter."
lakers,3cm08j,ceelogreen5,5,Wed Jul 8 23:25:49 2015 UTC,"Steph is a flat-out magician with the basketball. His handles are tops in the league, on par with Kyrie. I don't see those same handles right now with D'Angelo. D plays a slower game, like Harden, and took a lot of contested jumpers last year. Hopefully, being surrounded by NBA level talent will really enables him to put his court vision and playmaking to use. That would help free up his game at this stage. Ultimately, he needs to find another gear to get to where he wants to on the floor, either with a trickier handle or plain strength and quickness conditioning, or he's going to have trouble finding clean looks for his jumper."
lakers,3cm08j,owningypsie,3,Thu Jul 9 00:47:23 2015 UTC,"His release is not that quick. But his vision is impressive. I would be happy with a new CP3, or Nash"

lakers,3cm08j,bornduringwinter,2,Thu Jul 9 03:01:10 2015 UTC,"Some stats for comparison:  Curry freshman in college:  21.5/4.6/2.8 on .463 FG%, .408 3P%, .855 FT%  Curry junior (last year) in college:  28.6/4.4/5.6 on .454 FG%, .387 3P%, .876 FT%   Russell freshman in college:   19.3/5.7/5.0 on .449 FG%, .411 3P%, .756 FT%  Curry was a good 3P% shooter, but he wasn't the godlike 3P% shooter that he is now, back in college. I think it's up to D'Angelo in terms of how hard he's willing to work to refine his skills."
lakers,3cm08j,aveydey,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:24:10 2015 UTC,.387% is ridiculous considering he was the only option on a poor team and would constantly be the focus of every team's defense.
lakers,3cm08j,TheJusticeCock,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:46:25 2015 UTC,Russell's FT% is also odd. It's not common to see a sub-80% matched up with essentially 50%/40%.

lakers,3cm08j,avengedteddy,0,Thu Jul 9 01:37:52 2015 UTC,Everyone in the Lakers front office and coaching staff think this.
lakers,3cm08j,Chilled_Penguin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:52:14 2015 UTC,Let's let him play a game first.
lakers,3cm08j,avengedteddy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:21:22 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who is seeing more of a Nash type game from Russell? The passing vision he has is incredible. Nash was an excellent shooter as well, just like D'angelo projects to be but I honestly see Russel being more of a 15-18 pts per night guy with 6-8 assists."
lakers,3cm08j,Chilled_Penguin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:59:46 2015 UTC,"the only things that resemble to curry is his height, face, passing, and 3 pt shots (but diff trajectories). Curry can beat a man off the dribble and drive to the bucket. This is one of Russel's weaknesses."
lakers,3cm08j,avengedteddy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:28:35 2015 UTC,"Actually that too is one of Curry's knocks. That he's not athletic enough. I'm surprised you didn't know, they talked about it after every lay up in the play offs. That's how he's gotten so nifty around the rim."
lakers,3clhq4,dadiomcduck,7,Wed Jul 8 20:57:14 2015 UTC,This is why Byron has to ease up on his training camps. He makes it tough and grueling for the players because he wants to show the old school way of how he was trained. AAU wasn't around during his time so he's just over training these kids when it comes to training camp.
lakers,3clhq4,Larryduhlobster,5,Wed Jul 8 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"No kidding. Hope Bryon also doesn't break any veterans, too, like with Hibbert. Hibbert has been so durable, hardly missing games, as the Pacers really knew how to manage him, letting him only play 20 to 30 minutes a game because of his huge frame.  Hope Bryon remembers his task former task master, Pat Riley, who also had grueling practices, even managing to have Magic Johnson pull a hamstring in practice one year during the playoffs, which may have cost them a ring.  Also I remember hearing Magic and his teammates were worried about Pat pushing the aging Kareem too hard and asked Pat to give some slack to Kareem in practice.  Man, I really hope the Lakers are hearing about guys like Steve Kerr and how they use analytics, not just for game strategy and player evaluation, but for practice, too. There was an article on Kerr, about how he has his players wear wearable monitoring technology so they can track their speed, heart rates, jumping height, etc. Based on the info, Kerr would then adjust the intensity and workload of each practice.  He believed a fatigued player is a more injury-prone player. I guess sometimes his analytic staff would show him numbers indicating that Curry or Thompson must be fatigued or sleep-deprived because of increased heart rates and other stats, so Kerr would let them have a day off from a game to rest.  Kerr also said he eliminated all the tedious and grueling drills that he hated as a player, and tried to make practice more fun by introducing music, and humor into practice, so players stay more focused, so they won't lose concentration and make a fatal mistake causing an injury.  Little things like that, really help to give Warriors the edge. I hope the Lakers learn and do the same."
lakers,3clhq4,UltraFlyingTurtle,2,Wed Jul 8 23:23:17 2015 UTC,"yea, i read that article on espn! It's crazy because they were the healthiest team this season and they had guys with a injury prone history (Curry, Bogut, Livingston etc).   Lakers are stuck in old school thinking -_- just got to wait till there's new ownership who would implement these ideas"
lakers,3clhq4,Larryduhlobster,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:55:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Dodgers with Andrew Friedman and Farhan Zaidi are doing that as well -- using analytics and other ways for injury prevention -- hiring sport technology firms to test their products on both major- and minor-leaguers, analyzing throwing mechanics, educating players on nutrition right away on the farm system, providing healthier food. Friedman while with the Rays, had a remarkable history of healthy pitchers.  Maybe Mark Madsen can be that guy to help Lakers modernize, as I guess he's the most analytic guy there, and he has that Stanford education."
lakers,3clhq4,UltraFlyingTurtle,2,Thu Jul 9 01:08:11 2015 UTC,Exactly why I think Kerr when it's all said and done might be a top 5 of all time coach. He's doing everything right and it's only his first season.

Like he said at the end, that game was personal to him.  A lot of was going into that game. The West was unbelievably packed (The Lakers ended with the top seed in the West with fifty-seven wins and the eighth place Nuggets had fifty. Golden State would have also had fifty wins [But lost the tiebreaker to Denver] had they not just given up the last two games after they lost to Nuggets). Utah was on a ridiculous home game winning streak. A lot of tension heading into that game."

lakers,3cltqv,WOX_69,2,Thu Jul 9 02:39:38 2015 UTC,I think Kobe loves playing Utah because he still remembers those air balls during his rookie year in the playoffs. He uses that as motivation like he emphasized in his recent documentary. God damn I love Kobe.

As far as CC goes, there are really only 2 things that stuck out to me immediately:  It looks off to me how the yellow arrows are connected to the focal rectangle, and the purple squares beneath are a few pixels spaced off. I think if you dropped the arrows down the same distance as the purple squares it'd look nice. That could be just me though.   The only other thing I saw is there seems to be a lot going on with the illustration on his bottom lip. I haven't seen the original photo, so I could understand if the light source created coloration like that on his lip.   That's just two very very small things though.

lakers,3cl0ju,SeigeFour5,2,Wed Jul 8 20:20:49 2015 UTC,"The Clippers new logo should've been a dumpster fire. Seriously.   Let's start with CP3.  He makes everyone better, right? But didn't they lost three straight to Rockets in the playoffs? Last year in the regular season, the Clips had a three game losing streak and a four game losing streak. With the season on the line, when players like Kobe and Lebron put others on their shoulders and go, CP3 didn't make any one better.  But DJ has gotten better in playing with CP3, right? So DJ would have done less with Kyrie? Westbrooke? Curry? Lillard? Wall? The PG is SUPPOSED to make other players around him better... isn't that why they pass? DJ was a second round pick that has worked himself into a max deal, to say that Rivers and CP3 are the sole reasons that DJ has progressed is plain wrong.  Did he make David West any better in New Orleans? What about Jimmer Ferdette?  West was good before and after CP3, Jimmer was bad before and after CP3.  It's just as likely that DJ helped CP3 become who he is as much as it is the other way around.  Let's talk about Doc Rivers, the Ainge benefactor.  What has Doc done that's been overly impressive? His GM gave him a team with Rondo and Paul Pierce, then added Kevin Garnet and Ray Allen. A team that plays in the East. The LEAST Doc could've done was get his team deep into the playoffs.  How different is Doc Rivers from Spoelstra? You want more proof? David Blatt.   But what about Doc Rivers the GM? Give him an ugly sweater and how much different is he than Elgin Baylor? Baylor was an awesome player, my favorite HANDS down. But the dude had the worst owner EVER and was still able to put together more playoff rosters than Doc has. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know Doc hasn't had a chance to really put his hands on a draft yet... because he traded the picks.   So let's pretend that DJ goes back to the Clips. The salary cap is wrecked.  Lance Stephenson was a great pickup, but they can't afford to keep him again next year. And if they do keep him, Blake is a free agent in two years.  They're talking about trading Jamal Crawford who was their bench last year, what can a 35 year old with bad knees bring them back? Cap space? Another Rivers kid is going to be a free agent next year once he's done at UCI, he can be had cheap.  All of that boils down to one thing....  The return of the Super Sonics!"

Michael Beasley was never mature enough to seek help. Upshaw has an entire team dedicated to make sure he gets and stays right. The Kid knows his problems and has taken action to correct them. Maybe I'm an optimist, but if you watched his interview yesterday, it seems like his off-court issues are behind him.

lakers,3ckh1d,Buckelroo,4,Wed Jul 8 17:23:28 2015 UTC,"I agree..... I think , from the interview, he has realized this is the end of the line for him. But I think being to develop arounds and with players that are hard works ( Randle, Russell, Clarkson) as well as veterans who wont let him act out ( Kobe and Scott), I think we just got the steal of the draft. Also learning from an elite defensive player like Hibbert, Upshaw could become a beast."
lakers,3ckh1d,Westcoastbestcoast4,7,Wed Jul 8 18:43:05 2015 UTC,"He has a loooooong way to go, but if he puts his mind to just basketball i think he can be an elite defender. He must practise more than all the guys on all of the summer teams"
lakers,3ckh1d,gumarik,2,Wed Jul 8 17:07:47 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying though.  I don't have any concerns about the basketball, it's everything else that should be worried about."
lakers,3ckh1d,UltraFlyingTurtle,5,Wed Jul 8 17:34:20 2015 UTC,"I don't really think it was anything harder than weed.  Reading this Foxsports article on Upshaw gave me some hope that Upshaw can turn things around.  It gives a lot more background on Upshaw, about how he felt out of place as kid for being so tall, causing possible anxiety issues, and about the example his older peers set in his neighborhood.   ""As a kid I saw all these players smoking weed and driving Bentleys, and I thought, 'This is the lifestyle,' "" Upshaw told me. ""That's what I was exposed to. I wasn't exposed to guys like LeBron James. I followed the flashy guys.""  ""I didn't think anything of it at first,"" Upshaw told me recently. ""It didn't come to a bad habit until on down the line. It led to stress, anxiety, depression -- all self-destructive stuff.    The thing that gives the writer of the article hope about Upshaw is that in the past, he's talked to many college coaches who have kicked out ""problem kids,"" and often they'll throw the kid under the bus in private conversations, whereas with Upshaw there isn't that bad blood, and in fact his ex-college coach is still rooting for him.   Of all I've learned about Upshaw, perhaps the most telling was what Romar, the University of Washington coach who kicked him off his team, told me. ""He's a guy that at heart wants to do the right thing,"" Romar said. ""I am rooting for him 100 percent. I do not want to see him fail. It just so happened that I was in charge, and I had to make decisions.""  Over the years I've spoken with so many coaches whose players have gotten in trouble. Hardly ever does a coach want to talk on the record about a troubled player; it reflects poorly on the program. And when you delve into off-the-record talk, a coach often will throw a troubled player under the bus.  Which made my talk with Romar especially striking.  Romar described Upshaw as a kid who made mistakes -- those self-destructive mistakes common with addicts -- but who remained a good kid deep down. Romar told of times when Upshaw ran into some extra money, like when a check for a Pell Grant came through, and he'd go buy food and give it to homeless people. That was something he'd do on his own, without telling people. When the team had community service events, Upshaw was the first one to want to go, and would end up becoming the star of the event. He's a big man with a big personality.   http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/nba-draft-washington-huskies-robert-upshaw-believes-he-s-worth-the-risk-061915"
lakers,3ckh1d,badguymatt,2,Wed Jul 8 19:49:54 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly more-so excited for Upshaw than I am for us having Upshaw on our SL team if that makes sense? I just want to see the kid do good. He really seems to have a good head on his shoulders now (at least he's trying awfully hard.) and he sees how close his dream is to him, despite the fact that he fucked things up with drugs.   I feel deeply for Upshaw because I'm going through similar circumstances. (Obviously not playing for the Lakers tho lol.) even if he doesn't work out for this team, I just hope he finds his place in the league."
lakers,3ckh1d,TheRealMelvinGibson,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"I think that's why I'm rooting so hard for him too. I know what it's like to have stuff stripped from you as a kid who is just trying to have fun and live a normal life like. You can't realize how negatively those things can effect you till its too late. And it's easy to fall into it more than once. But I also know it's possible to put it behind you. And judging from that interview, I see a guy who has done just that. Only time will tell, but if I could do it just so I can do well in class, Robert can do it to realize his dream. It takes some of us time to mature enough to take on such responsibilities. And I think he's ready."
lakers,3ckh1d,aeisenst,2,Mon Jul 13 05:41:58 2015 UTC,My only hope is that he is better than (though clearly not as good looking as) Sacre

lakers,3ckh1d,Citizen_of_Atlantis,2,Wed Jul 8 18:15:18 2015 UTC,"For Upshaw this may be his last chance and it seems like he understands this. But at the same time it's easy to say the right words, time will tell if his actions off-the-court back it up. I think everyone is rooting for this kid but now's when rubber hits the road for him."
lakers,3ckh1d,invisible_monkey,2,Wed Jul 8 19:27:17 2015 UTC,"So all I've seen of the guy are really favorable YouTube highlight clips and two seconds of an interview, but even in that brief clip he struck me as a really smart guy. And while he has some incredible physical tools, the rule with NBA players (and really all pro athletes) are that the guys with the greatest chance to reach their potential are all pretty bright.   It's way too early to chart his career--whether it's with the Lakers or not--but as long as he keeps his head straight (and stays healthy) I think he'll be really good."
lakers,3ckh1d,Toomuchgamin,2,Wed Jul 8 23:58:24 2015 UTC,"I am officially bringing up charges against the OP for violating the ""Upshaw = next Kareem"" circlejerk rule.  I would highly recommend not violating rules Clarkson=Magic 2.0 and Russel=Magic 3.0 circlejerk, or may God have mercy on you."

lakers,3ckh1d,FuriousFlex,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:26:59 2015 UTC,Well Lakers are giving him a chance to change. So if he does then better for him and us because we might have found our next young center to develop and grow with this young core.
lakers,3ckh1d,lufty574,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:42:39 2015 UTC,"Honestly if he can turn into a rim protector off the bench and give someone like Tarik Black competition I'd be very pleased. Anything more then that is great extra, and anything less isn't a big deal because we didn't use a pick on him."
lakers,3ckh1d,avengedteddy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:45:54 2015 UTC,"the only thing suspect is why did all these teams pass up on him? Yes he got kicked off but from what we heard, its from marijuana. There's got to be a LOT more to it that the public knows and the schools don't want to leak that information. We just have to trust all is behind him now... but there's a lot more to it than marijuana. I hope I am wrong."
lakers,3ckh1d,unix04,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:15:54 2015 UTC,"The more successful Upshaw is in the NBA, the more likely he will relapse into his old habits. Hopefully he keeps his head on straight. I hope the Lakers keep him on his toes for his entire career, whether it's one summer or many, many seasons"
lakers,3ckh1d,dL1727,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:31:26 2015 UTC,"Timeout: He's signed to our summer league roster. Does this give the Lakers any kind of leverage in signing him to an NBA deal? Or is he seemingly an UFA since he was drafted by anyone? In which case, if a team desperate for a center (a la the Clippers assuming no DeAndre) wants to throw a stupid contract at him, they can."
lakers,3ckh1d,Dsarg_92,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:37:53 2015 UTC,"I feel that anything can be possible. Realistically speaking, with the right people surrounding him like others have mentioned and him getting his act together, there's a legit chance that he could be the Hasaan Whiteside for the team."
lakers,3ckh1d,johnsonfrusciante,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:05:56 2015 UTC,"honestly I don't think he's gonna do shit, even though I want to believe he will. Psychologists and drug problems for a young kid can be bad, but most importantly he said in an interview that he's only played bball like 8 times since last being kicked off...  I hope he does well though"
lakers,3ckh1d,captaincyfk,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:41:07 2015 UTC,"put yourself in his shoes though. imagine he's like oh fuck i'm actually in the league after all my bullshit from before. i'm undrafted to the LAKERS. i'm confident in my abilities, i just need to keep my ass on the court. maybe it's wrong for me to assume he's become mature enough to realize what he needs to do, but based off what i've heard in interviews (limited i know) he seems like he's put all that shit behind him. He wants to be the next Lakers center. we gotta get behind him as fans and shoot positive energy his way. this fool could be so good. He ended up on this summer squad and on this team at the timing he did for a reason. i dont think he'll fizzle out"

lakers,3ckh1d,JHeezy19,0,Thu Jul 9 06:20:42 2015 UTC,"Cut the kid some slack, he's only 21 years young. I mean, I'm pretty sure I speak for everyone that we all did some real dumb shit at that age. I know I did.  While he can just as easily go down the Michael Beasley route, at least he seems like he's trying to right himself. Only time will tell. Hopefully somebody in the organization keeps this kid on the right path to succeed in the league."
lakers,3ckh1d,CalcBros,2,Wed Jul 8 18:12:06 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but I don't like this argument.  Sure, we did stupid things when we were 21, but we also weren't striving at the time to be at the very top tier of our field.  I was just trying to get enough credits to graduate college. If I knew there was the opportunity for a $4M a year job (regardless of the field) if I held my shit together...you'd bet there would have been ZERO dumb shit going on. Will Hunting didn't deserve to get a sweet job after f'ing around and neither does Upshaw.  Both have to prove they can handle it.    That said...we could definitely use a rim defender :)"
lakers,3ckh1d,JHeezy19,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:38:31 2015 UTC,Can you really guarantee that though? I thought I was invincible when I was 21 and was smart enough to get away with whatever I wanted to do. Upshaw probably thought the shame thing.

This years free agency clearly showed coaching and basketball side matters for a lot of these guys. I respect Byron Scott but you are not going to impress/lure LMA or any other upcoming FA with him as your head coach.   He doesn't want to be a part of tanking and our moves indicates that Lakers done with the tanking and wants to be successful.   If he is leaving Dallas and taking one year off just wait for him and give Scott another season however if he wants to coach this year you just can't say no to second best coach in the league.
lakers,3cnpr4,Kimi7,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:15:04 2015 UTC,"To be fair, apparently Carlisle didn't impress potential superstar FAs in Dallas. They've swung and missed on every one they've tried to sign there."

Byron may not be the best coach, but hes got a history of helping young guards develop and I think Clarkson and Browns play last year proved it."

lakers,3colm8,AaronOG,0,Thu Jul 9 18:16:10 2015 UTC,"The floor for all these players is they dud out and play over seas. So that's a dumb question. But I will give a rough estimation as to what I think our talent can develop into relative to current NBA players.   Russell has an interesting game. Not super athletic but knows how to control the tempo. The first players that comes to mind is steph curry. But he will never be in the same league shooting-wise. Manu actually isn't a bad comparison.  The only thing  I can see brown becoming is a slightly unathletic wing guy who can shoot. Maybe something along the lines of Dudley.   Nance is pretty athletic. He's got some upside and could become a decent 3 and D guy. There's a bunch of these guys in the league so take your pick. Definitely a role player. Not starting caliber by any means   Black is what he is. A decent second/third string center who is strong enough to push guys out of the paint. Again, take your pick. He's nothing special.   Clarkson is good. He could wind up being really good. John wall? Hell no. Westbrook? Not even close. But he'll have that same style of play so I guess we just have our expectations a little high. He matches the frame though.  I see Randle as a bully in the paint. I hope he turns out something like a more versatile/athletic Randolph.  Upshaw is the most interesting. He is an amazing rim protector but is pretty lacking in every other aspect of the game. If he really pulls his act together and puts his mind to it. People may be talking about him the same way they talk about gobert. There's really no telling with this guy.   So there you go. You're comparisons were way off. I almost just laughed and kept scrolling but you sound genuinely interested so there's my 2 cents."
lakers,3colm8,TheRealMelvinGibson,-2,Fri Jul 10 04:42:15 2015 UTC,"Floor is probably who they are now?  Clarkson could be like Westbrook or john wall,-- a speedy & athletic combo guard penetrating the paint frequently   Russel -- generational player -- cp3, Nash-like. What Daren Williams could've have been ? Russel & randle both could be the next HOF type lakers  Randle -- bass is a nice pickup as they seem similar -- randle is an athletic zbo ?   Capabilities and versatility of MWP,/Odom?  Randle is weird in that he can do so much for his body type. N he has the drive to dominate offensively like Kobe-. Would be nice to see how he fairs physically matching up with lebron  Upshaw -- if his lifes together-- hard to find a better center in terms of defending the rim, reducing guards penetrating the paint and having effective post moves. Can have great quickness.  With developing the shot., would b nice if he modelled his game after KG"

lakers,3ck4yo,hippedonphonics,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:17:48 2015 UTC,"He basically gave up in games last year (see the games where Byron benched him half way through the games for Ellington), he's a huge distraction that clearly only cares about his persona and entertainment value than his value as a basketball player, AND even when he was healthy he played like shit last year. Sure, he's good for a few soundbites, but he's a pretty terrible player that doesn't seem to take anything seriously. We also just got Lou Williams, who is a better version of Nick Young - don't really need two of those guys (or 3 depending on the Kobe we get on a given night).  There was also a statistic I heard Kornheiser say on PTI about how since he's been in the league, he has the second most losses of any player in that span (never found the statistic online) - very exemplary of the type of player he is."
lakers,3ck4yo,JHeezy19,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:31:54 2015 UTC,"Have you seen him play? He flat out sucks.  He'll stink it up on the court and do postgame interviews acting like he was the best player on the court. People ate this shit up for the first year because it was ""entertaining"" but in the end, he can't cover up his shit stains on the court with his off the court gimmicks.  And no, he's not being confident. He's being an arrogant ass. Dallas or Portland should take a look at a trade with us.

lakers,3cgtg1,SSD65,8,Tue Jul 7 20:53:22 2015 UTC,I loved a radio interview someone posted here recently with him.  He sounds like a good guy who just lost his way for a minute.

I get what you're saying but no, you need as many people as possible helping not hurting your chances for relapse.   Although to be honest, I'm unsure of whether he went through a true addiction and came out of it, and will always be an addict. Or he was just making some poor choices for someone who has so much riding on this period of his life. Listening to his radio interview, he wouldn't admit to anything beyond ""not being grown up""."

lakers,3chp2p,get_0n_your_knees,65,Wed Jul 8 00:09:45 2015 UTC,"I got good news for you: The Lakers don't want to tank either.   Think we're signing dudes like Lou Will and Bass if the aim was to tank? We could easily just scrap up D-Leaguers to fill the roster if we wanted. Next year is about progress, watching our young core develop, watching Kobe having his possible last season etc. We aren't a franchise used to losing, and we don't want to create that losing culture. You better believe we'll be as competitive as we can be next season."
lakers,3chp2p,amarstan,15,Wed Jul 8 00:14:45 2015 UTC,"What is everyone talking about? We can't tank next year. Philly has our pick and it's only top 3 protected. The way the lotto works even the worst record in the league stands a good chance of dropping out of the top 3 and it's incredibly hard to lock down the worst record. (See NYK this year).  So the Lakers couldn't really tank even if they wanted to.  Let's also not forget that the Lakers haven't begun a single season with the intent to tank. Injuries and underperformance have led to bad records by the all star break, and a decision to tank the rest of the season away."
lakers,3chp2p,FuriousFlex,5,Wed Jul 8 05:02:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I don't think we are tanking, just aiming to win around 35 games."
lakers,3chp2p,kittonmittonz,15,Wed Jul 8 04:44:26 2015 UTC,"The fuck? We're aiming for the playoffs, which starts with the division. The lakers aren't thinking 35. Kobe isn't thinking 35. I'm not thinking 35. Will we win our division? Probably not, but aiming for 35 wins is a losing record. We shouldn't view that as our ceiling."
lakers,3chp2p,FuriousFlex,-1,Wed Jul 8 06:22:06 2015 UTC,You think this roster in the west makes it to 8th seed?
lakers,3chp2p,kittonmittonz,17,Wed Jul 8 06:42:01 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter what I think our record will be. That wasn't the point of my comment, but I'm optimistic about our squad man"
lakers,3chp2p,dadiomcduck,2,Wed Jul 8 07:09:31 2015 UTC,"If Kobe plays like he did in 2012-13 (the last time he was healthy), this team could very well make the playoffs."

lakers,3chp2p,howdoesilogin,-5,Wed Jul 8 14:39:17 2015 UTC,"It will all depend on how things turn out with the young guys. If they play well we should aim for the 8th spot. If we get some injuries or something else goes wrong, then we have to tank hard to avoid another wasted season"
lakers,3chp2p,Tekdepledj,7,Wed Jul 8 08:08:05 2015 UTC,"I think this offseason has shown that we cant have a garbage product on the court and expect to sign free agents. We might not get over .500 but if our young talent can showcase promise, that will make LA all the more attractive next offseason. And I think thats the right idea considering the cap jumps + the free agent pool is supposed to be stacked."
lakers,3chp2p,spudwinkle,7,Wed Jul 8 01:39:57 2015 UTC,"We won't be considered a tanking team, although we won't be above .500 either. Rebuilding takes tim3, and that's all we need with our young core. The Vets we picked up will definitely help out the youth movement and get their feet super wet."
lakers,3chp2p,Schneeky,8,Wed Jul 8 00:20:27 2015 UTC,Signing Lou Will means the tanking era is over
lakers,3chp2p,FreshDiamond,3,Wed Jul 8 01:14:41 2015 UTC,We aren't tanking. All you have to do is look at the moves they have made after striking out on big names. We aren't going to be very good but we aren't tanking.
lakers,3chp2p,PSSYPUNISHERRR,3,Wed Jul 8 02:45:58 2015 UTC,I don't think free agents wanna see us tank either.
lakers,3chp2p,C3PO1Fan,3,Wed Jul 8 03:25:15 2015 UTC,"If the Lakers are going to get Randle, Clarkson and Russell the minutes they're going to need to develop, they're going to lose a lot of games.  It's just how it works.  Unless we're talking Kareem or Wilt, young dudes lose games, and when you put them on the floor together, they lose a lot.    I think it's going to be a fun team.  I think Kobe's going to work his ass off.  I think we're going to see talented young guys that are going to make us hopeful for the future, and stylish play from Young and Williams.  I even am optimistic about Hibbert looking more like he did a few years ago.  But I see all that happening on a team that wins around 25 games."

lakers,3chp2p,StealthRUs,-2,Wed Jul 8 21:15:25 2015 UTC,A top-3 pick is plenty of reason to tank.  We still need young players.
lakers,3chp2p,StealthRUs,2,Wed Jul 8 14:05:49 2015 UTC,"Why the hell would we take such a risk? We wouldn't be the worst team in the NBA (76ers...) and even if we were second worst...just look at the Knicks, who got the 4th spot.  Besides, tanking creates a awful losing culture. I mean, who's gonna want to go to Philly anytime soon? The only reason the tank happened the last two seasons was because our squad was decimated with injuries anyway."
lakers,3chp2p,TimeisIllmatic95,0,Wed Jul 8 16:06:41 2015 UTC,"Why the hell would we take such a risk?   Because we are going to suck regardless, so we might as well win at sucking and get a possible future franchise cornerstone - or something that could be traded for a cornerstone.   and even if we were second worst...just look at the Knicks, who got the 4th spot   And look at the Wolves that kept the # 1 pick and look at the 76ers that kept the # 3 pick.  That's 2/3 that kept their picks.   Besides, tanking creates a awful losing culture. I mean, who's gonna want to go to Philly anytime soon?    I mean look at the OKC Thunder who tanked for 3 straight years.  Who wants to go there and play with Durant and Westbrook?  Look at that losing culture the Warriors created by losing all those years and getting Curry, Thompson, Barnes, and Green in the draft.    The only reason the tank happened the last two seasons was because our squad was decimated with injuries anyway.    Which saved the FO from their own stupid selves."
lakers,3chp2p,StealthRUs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:07:35 2015 UTC,*Top 3 protected. It would be very hard to keep that pick. The Lakers could be the worst team in the NBA next season and the pick wouldn't be guaranteed.
lakers,3chp2p,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:16:15 2015 UTC,"They would have a 2/3 shot at it.  Which is far better than a 2% shot at it if we pick up an extra 9-10 wins.  I could live with tanking into the bottom 3 and not making it.  We lose a bunch of games either way, but Russell, Randle, Nance, and Upshaw get a lot more playing time if we commit to the tank."
lakers,3chp2p,StealthRUs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:22:51 2015 UTC,"Of course it would be helpful to add another talented youngster onto the roster, but tanking is way too risky. Lakers so-called ""won too many games"" last year but we ended up w/ a top 2 pick due to luck, so I feel like tanking is more luck than actually losing a lot of games."
lakers,3chp2p,JHeezy19,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:29:26 2015 UTC,"Like I told /u/JHeezy19 Philly had as many or more close game losses than we did last year (depending on how many points your threshold for close games was - I looked at 4,5, and 6 points).  If people think Philly was just straight-up garbage last year, we were just as bad.  There's no ""almost a lot better"" about our team.  We earned that record."
lakers,3chp2p,StealthRUs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:40:45 2015 UTC,"But nobody is saying ""almost a lot better.""   You just continue to misconceive optimism surrounding the young guys as ""holy shit we're going to the Finals.""  At this point, that's not even ""being realistic."" You're just disagreeing to disagree."
lakers,3chp2p,JHeezy19,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:46:39 2015 UTC,"No, I'm just disagreeing with the viewpoint that we were (un)lucky to end up with the 4th worst record because of all of our close games, and that with a ball bounce here or there we would've been the 7th or 8th worst.  A lot of people on here like to push that story.  We were legitimately that bad, there was no ""almost better"" about it."
lakers,3chp2p,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:48:28 2015 UTC,Who's ever said that in this thread or the previous thread?
lakers,3chp2p,acekickerx,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:00:51 2015 UTC,It's been repeated on this sub by a lot of people who say how hard it would be for us to tank.  They always point to our close losses as to how close we came to not making bottom 5 and keeping our pick from PHX.
lakers,3chp2p,jhueckel,4,Thu Jul 9 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"Also, we gave up our first round pick in the 2016 draft, so there's no point in tanking"
lakers,3chp2p,GirthyAfghan,3,Wed Jul 8 01:44:35 2015 UTC,It's top-3 protected. So we would have to be really bad to keep it
lakers,3chp2p,Walooo,5,Wed Jul 8 04:57:21 2015 UTC,Really bad and lucky.
lakers,3chp2p,StealthRUs,4,Wed Jul 8 05:55:14 2015 UTC,Better to be lucky than bad. (Cavs 2014)
lakers,3chp2p,JHeezy19,-1,Wed Jul 8 05:55:51 2015 UTC,We have our pick if we tank.  That's why tanking matters.
lakers,3chp2p,StealthRUs,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:44:33 2015 UTC,No we don't.  There's a thing called the draft lottery. Tanking doesn't guarantee anything.
lakers,3chp2p,JHeezy19,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:46:13 2015 UTC,"There's no guarantee, but it would be a lot more likely than not that we would keep our pick if we tanked."
lakers,3chp2p,Rebel908,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:04:41 2015 UTC,"You don't build success around probability man. That's called gambling.  Oh wait.  I'm talking to a dude who can forsee the future, I forgot. So since you were 100% correct on the Nash gamble, how many wins is our current roster gonna end up with next season?"
lakers,3chp2p,JHeezy19,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"If the pick was top 5 protected, there is a benefit to being the worst team period, as that team can't get any lower than 4th, which is what put the team in such a perilous situation this year, since there's a fairly high chance of dropping 1 or 2 slots, and as the 4th team, Lakers could have dropped to 6.   There is a possibility of dropping to 4th with the worst record, 35.7%, but I'd take the 64.3% chance at keeping a top 3 pick.   I don't think the team needs to, but if they're going to stink, stink it up instead of trying to cover the smell after a couple of months."
lakers,3chp2p,dalas3322,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:45:08 2015 UTC,"It's become a lot more difficult to be the worst team in the league this season. Portland and Dallas just hit the lowest of the lows, on top of the fact that last seasons' bottom feeders, including the Lakers, didn't really get much better."
lakers,3chp2p,JHeezy19,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:40:16 2015 UTC,yeah two 20+ win seasons is enough for me.  we actually still might win around that many games but at least won't have people rooting for losses or coaching staff tanking games on purpose
lakers,3chp2p,rtrainer30,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:43:04 2015 UTC,"The Lakers would not have acquired Hibbert, Lou Will, and Bass if they were aiming to tank.  They're slowly developing a solid core while building assets. Our FO pretty much accepted the fact they're losing out on next years' first round pick and are moving forward. If we do land a top 3 pick, it's a sweet bonus."

lakers,3chp2p,DoctorJared,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:48:48 2015 UTC,"In the NBA, its worse to be mediocre than it is to be outright terrible. If the season goes awful, stay awful and try your damn best to keep that pick, or barely miss the playoffs, but look like a team that's going in the right direction so the team can attract FAs.   Don't be a 27 to 32 win team that doesn't have its shit figured out a la the Kings. Don't be so desperate to try and win that the team pisses away a top 3 pick because they end up 4th or 5th.  If the team is .500 or slightly below 500 by the ASG next year, yeah, keep fighting, look good. But if they're floundering, channel your inner tank commander."
lakers,3chp2p,StealthRUs,0,Wed Jul 8 20:36:23 2015 UTC,"So I know tanking sucks but it really is in the best interest of the team. If we were able to keep our pick this year it'd be top 3 which would be awesome but it would save us our 2018 pick from Orlando (would turn into 2 2nd rounders I think). We would save that pick because you can't trade picks in back to back years and since 2017 would belong to the sixers we'd get lucky.  That being said, the lakers aren't trying to tank so over the next three years were only going to have 1 first round pick"

lakers,3cijno,Buckelroo,5,Wed Jul 8 04:45:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the ""fit"" thing sounds like a great sell bc Roy Hibbert is the only REAL guy at his position that will pry from his minuets.

lakers,3cijno,Kbmakaveli,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:42:19 2015 UTC,I have the same worry. It doesn't seem like we are going to have much of any cap room to sign him. Could other teams offer him more then?

lakers,3cgzei,Barian_Fostate,7,Tue Jul 7 21:51:24 2015 UTC,TW Sportsnet employee here. From what I've heard all the hype is real. These guys have been downright disgusting in practice.
lakers,3cgzei,Larryduhlobster,3,Wed Jul 8 04:20:18 2015 UTC,anything else about Russell that stood out to anyone?
lakers,3cgzei,Barian_Fostate,11,Wed Jul 8 04:29:26 2015 UTC,"Just that his workout was widely seen in the organization as the best of anyone in this class, and apparently it wasn't even close. There were those who still wanted Okafor anyway because of his potential to be a dominant scorer in the paint, but Byron wants to recreate Showtime and Russell is his best chance at doing that.  I don't think the Lakers will shoot the 3 ball any more than they did last year. That's not Byron's style and it's not what Showtime was about. Scott wants this team to MURDER people on the fast break. He wants to run defenses into exhaustion and always have people on their heels. Golden State will continue winning with ball movement and long range scoring, and to combat that Byron wants to play defense and have consistent offensive output with high percentage shots...I.E. Clarkson driving the basket like he does so well, Randle banging down low, and Russell finding people cutting into the paint to lay it in. He wants to get a constant stream of 2's rolling in at a fast pace and play good enough defense to force those 3 ball teams into bad shots. If the Splash brothers get challenged out wide enough to have an off night, Byron can beat them with this philosophy. That's a big ""if"" of course.  Either way Russell is the key to everything. Byron wants this kid to be able to get the offense in position to make those high percentage shots on every possession so that he is constantly putting pressure on the opposition to answer. The more desperate that people get to keep up with constant 2's by chucking 3's, the deeper they potentially dig themselves into a hole.  That's what made Magic so great with Showtime. His passing put constant pressure on the other team to keep up, and they simply couldn't. It took Herculean efforts from Larry fucking Bird to beat them. That's how effective it was.  If Russell can be a Magic clone like Byron thinks he can be, we will see Showtime in LA once again. That's what Worthy told me, anyway."
lakers,3cgzei,coupdevent,3,Wed Jul 8 04:54:38 2015 UTC,"So Byron's not totally convinced on the consistency of a jump shooting team. I get that and I don't think he's wrong, but he really needs to make sure our team can also shoot the 3. If there's no floor spacing that steady stream of 2s won't exist. You can't rely just on fast breaks to get your shots... I really really hope Byron doesn't ignore the 3. That's stupid."
lakers,3cgzei,ardyputra027,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:54:35 2015 UTC,"I dont think he ignores the 3. Perhaps he is saying that you cant rely on threes too much to win. Although recent champs have win by relying on them (gsw), but they got curry the best 3pt shooter perhaps we ever witness and his partner klay who could do 3pt layups"

lakers,3cgzei,Liquorpuki,4,Wed Jul 8 13:30:36 2015 UTC,"Clarkson, Randle and Russell is a promising core and they fit with each other.  You got Russell threading the needle, Randle's post-up game, all 3 can slash, Clarkson and Russell can shoot the 3 ball  You wanna see the wrong way to build off a tank job, look at the Sixers stockpiling centers.  Okafor is gonna get either Noel or Embiid traded before February"
lakers,3cgzei,mexicanborderlands,4,Wed Jul 8 00:11:40 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they would have picked russel if not for us lol"
lakers,3cgzei,Liquorpuki,3,Wed Jul 8 01:37:29 2015 UTC,"Yea I just think it's funny that here's a team whose been tanking longer than we have with 10x the picks stashed, and all they've done is stacked one position to death"
lakers,3cgzei,JHeezy19,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:51:40 2015 UTC,"They've obviously been picking the player many consider to be the best on the board. All of them just happened to be Centers.  Philly really isn't doing a bad job on their rebuild; they're hording draft picks because they know how valuable it is in the current NBA. It's all about assets. Hell, they could end up becoming a threat for this Lakers team a few years down the line, along with the Celtics."
lakers,3cgzei,yooorick,9,Wed Jul 8 17:59:30 2015 UTC,"Since a lot of the 2nd year players are dominating now (Gordon, McGary, Smart, Exum, etc) I'm pretty excited to see Clarkson play considering he already played pretty well last year. Another year of actual NBA experience under his belt I expect him to dominate the SL."
lakers,3cgzei,kanyetwittykitty,5,Tue Jul 7 21:30:27 2015 UTC,The reports of him putting in hard work this summer is exciting. Hopefully it all pays off this year!

lakers,3cgzei,arkansastraffic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:51:56 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Clarkson definitely has the most to lose. He's either getting a huge payday after this season if he excels or is out of the league if he flops.   Honestly, I think the former is more likely and the Lakers should try to see if he'll sign an extension right now."

lakers,3cgzei,JustAGuy993,3,Wed Jul 8 03:32:05 2015 UTC,The Lakers have far and away the most talent in the SL since Wiggins isn't playing (it would be very close in that case).  I'm expecting blowouts.
lakers,3cgzei,swolebeasley,3,Tue Jul 7 21:58:09 2015 UTC,Could Upshaw be the next Stifle Tower?
lakers,3cgzei,rebeltrillionaire,3,Tue Jul 7 23:08:46 2015 UTC,"It's totally possible. He's got elite, elite measurables, was putting up insane numbers within the minutes he played, and the only knocks on him as a project have nothing to do with basketball.   Since being undrafted and landing on the Lakers of all franchises, he has all the makings of a huge turnaround.   Our FO is pretty savvy too, they should figure out a way to keep him off the market for at least 5 years. Look at what the Rockets did with KJ McDaniels. He'll probably end up signing a much cheaper deal than if he stuck around in Philly and then told them over the summer not to match anything."
lakers,3cgzei,arkansastraffic,3,Tue Jul 7 23:25:26 2015 UTC,All this talk about Upshaw's troubled past...I just want to know if the dude can ball lol

He's an obviously incredibly intelligent guy. I hope he never loses this feeling that he's got today though.

He spoke well and sounded more professional than many atheletes out there. Love his confidence. Only played 8 times since washington but he is certain he can make the team after SL.
lakers,3ch7n0,avengedteddy,3,Tue Jul 7 22:23:30 2015 UTC,"My hope for him turning out to be a backup center for the Lakers is increasing the more I see him. His mid-range jumper looks good, attitude seems in check. Can't wait till Friday!"
lakers,3ch7n0,harryhov,2,Tue Jul 7 22:07:06 2015 UTC,Seems like he's truly sorry for his behavior in college. I think he'll mature well and be a good part of the team.  On a side note. What is it with big men and immaturity? Shaq and Dwight both were immature for a big chunk of their careers. Shaq grew out of it. Dwight...well...

lakers,3cify4,Aliensdoexist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:51:33 2015 UTC,That's different... in the triangle offense you're SUPPOSED to improvise (within the structure of the triangle).
lakers,3cify4,ape_cage,2,Wed Jul 8 22:18:55 2015 UTC,This is true. I think our lakers would do best in horns sets and some motion I think. Anything that can show the passing skill of this team  which is pretty good from the 1-4 positions.

lakers,3cgkre,lars5,6,Tue Jul 7 20:32:35 2015 UTC,I imagine that's not how he would shoot in an actual game. Looks more like he's just working on form and just making them. I don't see how you would work on release speed before you're even able to consistently make the shot.
lakers,3cgkre,TuneHD,-1,Tue Jul 7 21:06:35 2015 UTC,Why should he have to rush his jump shot? In what position will he be in late in the clock were he's far out and not in the block most of the time?
lakers,3cgkre,lakers__sad_summer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:43:01 2015 UTC,"late in the clock? If he has the ball in his hands late in the shot clock, forget it.

lakers,3cgkre,DJyoungHeisenberg,-3,Tue Jul 7 19:46:42 2015 UTC,Exactly. Why would he need to practice rushing his shot at all if it's not late in the clock when he will be living in the block?  Your premise of him 'needing' to have a quick(er) shot rn is what I refute.

lakers,3ck41e,LakersTurnip,3,Wed Jul 8 15:36:48 2015 UTC,"All this talk about Randle playing the 3 is silly. Why wouldn't we let him play his natural position before making him adjust to a different one? Playing the 3 often means you're going to have your hands full guarding the other team's best perimeter players. We want Randle to produce on offense, so it doesn't make sense to move him to the 3 for multiple reasons. Nance Jr isn't a good enough shooter to stretch the floor, but he is a good enough defender to guard 2-4, maybe saying he can guard 2s is a stretch,  but the fundamentals are there. I'd him in a Tony Allen role, not really an offensive option, but there to just guard the wing. (I'm not trying to sandbad Tony, but that's what he hangs his hat one). If that's the case then we can definitely slide Nance Jr to the 3. Josh Smith is the closest thing to actual cancer than exists in human form. Avoid at all costs."

I'm not sure how people on here decided Nash was going to mentor our PGs for the rest of his life.  He has no official position with the team and any work he put in with Clarkson last year was probably just some combination of him being a nice dude and feeling like he owed the Lakers something since he was still on the payroll.
lakers,3cgsm1,stevebeyten,6,Tue Jul 7 20:21:23 2015 UTC,"He's not pursuing a career, hes playing with a D4 B squad in the NPSL lets not act like nash is working out with an MLS team or hell even playing with college kids in the PDL.  Nash is just looking for some semi-professionally organized soccer and that's about it."
lakers,3cgsm1,cellcell,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:27:04 2015 UTC,Too bad his back hurt too much to even play 20 mins of basketball a night.
lakers,3cgsm1,vtechnique,8,Wed Jul 8 06:20:58 2015 UTC,20 minutes of NBA basketball bro
lakers,3cgsm1,coupdevent,12,Wed Jul 8 09:59:47 2015 UTC,Steve Nash is pursuing a soccer career   Ok.
lakers,3cgsm1,purplecorazon,7,Tue Jul 7 21:26:48 2015 UTC,"Steve Nash is pursuing a soccer career...   Except for the fact that trialing with a soccer club doesn't mean anything,👍."
lakers,3cgsm1,justgivingsomeadvice,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:45:51 2015 UTC,"People probably thought it because he lives in LA and figured maybe he wanted to spend time working with the Lakers while his kids are out. And he loved the sport too much to leave it?   A soccer career works too, would've loved for him to get an official position though"
lakers,3cgsm1,stevebeyten,3,Tue Jul 7 21:04:43 2015 UTC,"Oh totally agree - i was optimistic/hopeful but always found it odd that people on here would constantly say things like: ""Can't wait to see Nash tutoring Russell!"" as if we announced Nash was joining Scott's staff or something."
lakers,3cgsm1,raofblow290,-5,Tue Jul 7 21:08:39 2015 UTC,I thought you were being sarcastic about the soccer thing..what the fuck...that's pretty lame.
lakers,3cgsm1,stevebeyten,19,Tue Jul 7 20:36:25 2015 UTC,why is that lame? he's an avid soccer fan.   if he decided to come back and take some sort of assistant coaching position with the team - i'd be thrilled. but he doesn't owe us anything.
lakers,3cgsm1,raofblow290,3,Tue Jul 7 20:40:08 2015 UTC,"Cause if he is healthy enough to run like crazy playing soccer then I wish he made a comeback for basketball , so I personally think it's lame."
lakers,3cgsm1,TuneHD,13,Tue Jul 7 20:47:44 2015 UTC,Playing minor league soccer is not the same as playing professional basketball. He has an injury that makes the up and downs of basketball difficult whereas he'd be jogging around a lot kicking without much jumping on a minor league team.
lakers,3cgsm1,raofblow290,0,Tue Jul 7 21:11:10 2015 UTC,I assumed it was major league hahha no idea why...cause Nash is a boss
lakers,3cgsm1,purplecorazon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:26:37 2015 UTC,"He very well could have gone and played somewhere had he chosen to. I don't know that he'd be as successful at it as he was at basketball or if he would have even made it into one of the top European leagues, but he and Kobe have both said if there was any other sport they could play professionally, it would be soccer."
lakers,3cgsm1,lufty574,9,Tue Jul 7 21:54:32 2015 UTC,Steve is such a nice guy that I'm sure if he was in LA and D'angelo shot him a text asking for some pointers Steve would toss him a workout or two.
lakers,3cgsm1,iNteL-_-,-1,Tue Jul 7 22:06:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd hope so. And especially if he isn't living in New York or seriously dedicating all his time toward soccer rn; I'd like to see the two get together."

lakers,3cgsm1,Xenowait,2,Tue Jul 7 20:15:35 2015 UTC,Scott knows a thing or two about the game and winning championships. He never had Nash's numbers but he knows the game.  The franchise should bring in that guy they call Magic. I hear he knows something about the game.
lakers,3cgsm1,TuneHD,2,Wed Jul 8 04:55:57 2015 UTC,"Oh I've met Magic, that shady dude, who sleeps on a mat outside the staples. But we could also always consider Earvin Johnson, the man's a hall of famer."

lakers,3cgkg3,dissphemism,7,Tue Jul 7 23:06:58 2015 UTC,He is a good guy I wish him well. Also wish he played better while with the Lakers.
lakers,3cgkg3,John_The_Reddit_Man,7,Tue Jul 7 19:48:44 2015 UTC,"Wes isn't a bad dude, just a bad player. He never.. ever.. ever.. Should I add another? ever.. came anywhere close to his potential.   That being said, he'll be in a better position on that Clippers team with CP3 & Blake. He's getting too old to truly develop, but he & the Truth should provide some nice veteran leadership on the wing.   The fact that he signed on a minimum shows you his market value. He was a role player on the 4th worst team in the league last season."
lakers,3cgkg3,badguymatt,39,Tue Jul 7 20:03:40 2015 UTC,"Some of you guys are unbelievable, wes was a great role player for us. He could defend four positions and would give us a highlight block/dunk once in a while. I wish him the best."
lakers,3cgkg3,supermaor23,10,Tue Jul 7 19:28:01 2015 UTC,What defense? I happen to think he was completely overrated defensively.
lakers,3cgkg3,lemp44,3,Tue Jul 7 21:19:22 2015 UTC,No.
lakers,3cgkg3,UpnUpvote,4,Wed Jul 8 05:11:48 2015 UTC,He was the best defender on the team last year which doesn't say a whole lot but we still have very little depth at sf this year. I would have liked to see him stay.
lakers,3cgkg3,crawshay,-1,Tue Jul 7 20:25:44 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. I wish we could've kept him, he would've kept some depth on our bench."
lakers,3cgkg3,starspec,5,Tue Jul 7 20:29:45 2015 UTC,"He is what he is - a great athlete with a below average basketball IQ (which hinders his defensive capability), and very little basketball skill other than a very streaky J.    I wonder if he's getting paid peanuts again."

He's a good role player I feel like this just sets a bad example for potential FA when they see the lack of commitment the FO has for their players, besides for star players.  They need to show they are committed to the players they bring in.  We lost Ed Davis for nothing, and now Wes for nothing.  two quality role players gone."

Kobe will re-sign on a hometown discount and the Lakers will pick up a superstar like KD that wants to play with Kobe and Kobe respects enough to defer to.

lakers,3cgwib,numbnutsnz,14,Tue Jul 7 20:37:01 2015 UTC,"My take on the realistic best possible outcome:  We finish the year healthy, with Randle and Russell having great rookie campaigns, and Jordan Clarkson showing clear improvement from last year. We manage to unload Sacre, Kelly, and Swaggy P. Upshaw, Nance, and Brown show the skills required to be solid rotational players early on. Kobe maybe breaks a couple of records, Hibbert reverts to his old All-Star self, and we are in contention for the 8th seed for a while, but don't make it. Not a great season, but not nearly as bad as the past two.  However, we showcase the potential growth and improvement for the future with arguably the most talented young core in the league. We also show we're a superstar away from legitimate contention. Thus, we're a much more attractive FA destination for Kevin Durant, who would come into as promising a roster as there might be. We'd have both guard spots and the power forward position set for the future, while still having enough cap room to get some more quality guys, or another great player, such as Al Horford or Joakim Noah.  Also, since we own Hibbert's rights (traded to us), I believe we can sign other guys first, and then go over the cap limit to re-sign him, if he regains his former elite defensive level of play. There's that option as well. Same goes for Kobe, I believe.  We could then re-sign Kobe to a much more cap-friendly deal and have any of the following rosters:    PG: D'Angelo Russell - Jordan Clarkson  SG: Kobe Bryant - Lou Williams  SF: Kevin Durant - Anthony Brown  PF: Julius Randle - Brandon Bass - Larry Nance. Jr  C: Al Horford - Robert Upshaw    PG: D'Angelo Russell - Jordan Clarkson  SG: Kobe Bryant - Lou Williams  SF: Kevin Durant - Anthony Brown  PF: Julius Randle - Brandon Bass - Larry Nance. Jr  C: Joakim Noah - Robert Upshaw    PG: D'Angelo Russell - Jordan Clarkson  SG: Kobe Bryant - Lou Williams  SF: Kevin Durant - Anthony Brown - Larry Nance Jr.  PF: Al Horford - Julius Randle - Brandon Bass  C: Roy Hibbert - Robert Upshaw    PG: D'Angelo Russell - Jordan Clarkson  SG: Kobe Bryant - Lou Williams  SF: Kevin Durant - Anthony Brown - Larry Nance Jr.  PF: Al Jefferson - Julius Randle - Brandon Bass  C: Roy Hibbert - Robert Upshaw  We can get a talented big to pair with either Hibbert or Randle (or both!), and can move forwards with a great starting 5, and with very, very good depth. Add a couple of veteran ring-chasers and maybe a low-key trade for a 3-and-d player, and we're suddenly in contention again.  So basically, 2015 is about staying healthy and showing enough to convince the big FAs that our young guys will be great players, and thus they sign with us. No playoffs, no high lottery pick, just a season focused heavily on the development of our rookies. Best case scenario, we're candidates to contend a little over a year from now."
lakers,3cgwib,MrGoosemahn,9,Tue Jul 7 21:07:36 2015 UTC,"This. If this past off season has reinforced anything, it's that the mystique of the Lakers alone is not enough to lure marquee free agents. We must develop our young core so that our foundation is attractive. Without a promising foundation, our cap space is relatively worthless because we will be unable to attract top-tier free agents."
lakers,3cgwib,StuckFern,2,Tue Jul 7 22:47:23 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with this.  Really, what makes me so passionate about Lakers basketball is NOT the brand...it's what they bring to the game and the sport.  They need to find a way to bring exciting, fundamental basketball back to the franchise...which is what this franchise is known for.  All the flash and glam is trivial compared to this."
lakers,3cgwib,Andrew_Korenchkin,2,Wed Jul 8 03:08:11 2015 UTC,In all your scenarios you have gone with Kevin Durant. The problem there is that I think the Lakers might be really low on KD's radar for next season. OKC and Washington are probably the leading contenders for KD during free agency. We should probably think about what we can do if KD doesn't chose the Lakers (the most likely scenario).
lakers,3cgwib,k4f123,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:21:09 2015 UTC,"Well it is best possible scenarios. However, if we discard Durant, then we can focus on one of Horford and Noah, as well as getting a guy like Nicolas Batum or Danilo Gallinari.  Or maybe we only get one good talent and position the cap room to make a move for another great FA in 2017, which has the potential to be a very good free agent class (Dwight Howard, Derrick Rose, Blake Griffin, Russell Westbrook, Ty Lawson, Serge Ibaka, Stephen Curry, DeMar DeRozan). Not all of them will actually hit free agency, but some might."
lakers,3cgwib,MrGoosemahn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:53:38 2015 UTC,You've got it all planned out. I'm going all in on this plan.  If Noah can find his mojo again I'd like the lineup with him in it. Having his D but primarily his passing ability would be a huge problem for opposition teams.
lakers,3cgwib,gavi75,24,Tue Jul 7 21:22:41 2015 UTC,"Fuck realistic. This is what has to go down. We suddenly have a big 3 in the making Randle turns out to be a beast who dominates and can't be stopped driving it to the hole. We have the next magic in D'Lo who is a wizard with the ball. JC turns even more stud and gains Baby Mamba powers. Upshaw sees this and thinks ""oh man better fall in line"" and we have the most dominant big man in the league (in the making). Kobe, the GOAT and grand master, teaches this group the ways of the mamba and we don't need no damn KD or Westbrook or any of these half assed wannabe free agents that pick weak ass san antonio over the limelight. We stun the world. Land a 2 seed. ok ok, 3. The rookies make history. Lead by the GOAT, they make a deep playoff push and loose a heartbreaking conference final to Golden State. This lights the fire under their ass. Every GOAT team in history needs this. The pain makes them push it to the limit and kobe sees something. he says one more year, maybe 2. Takes the discount everyone is bitching for. We sign good FA's but retain our core. The bench is strong. Everyone sees the potential in the rooks. 2016-17 NBA CHAMPS. We're FUCKING BACK BOYS. With the youngest team ever to win the finals, we go back to back, establishing a new rivalry with golden state and dismiss the bitch ass clips. After 2 or 3 rings guess who finally comes up? Bitch ass celtics. We knew they's be back and we are ready. We face them in the finals 3 out of the next 5 years. Win all 3 of coarse. Bitch ass celtics, look at all these banners! Free agents pray to come to LA. Even Lebitch wants out of Cleveland for one more shot at the chip (we beat him once and he never made it back) but we say fuck off LeBron, we don't need your sorry ass old knees and non clutch shooting. Maybe off the bench replacing Randle? nah, nvm we rather not give your weak ass a ring. Then we basically dominate till 2025. Then it can all fall apart again or whatever (can't be too greedy).   EDIT: Oh yea, Kobe retires with 7. Suck it MJ."

lakers,3cgwib,rebeltrillionaire,0,Tue Jul 7 22:57:41 2015 UTC,Don't worry I upvoted you. I just don't think it's practical to expect more than 30 wins this year.
lakers,3cgwib,BABYPUBESS,2,Tue Jul 7 23:23:53 2015 UTC,"I think at the moment we're exactly at 35. If we somehow get some nice middle-aged vets we may get past 40.    Gerald Green Dorrell Wright   PG: Russell - Clarkson  SG: Kobe - Williams - J.Brown  SF: Green - Wright  - A. Brown  PF: Randle - Bass - Nance Jr.  C: Hibbert - Black - Upshaw  We'd have one roster spot left. If we didn't pick up Lou Williams, Bass, and Hibbert, we'd only be winning between 10 and 20 games. But let's check it out with math.    Kobe | 8 WS (estimated dropoff) Williams | 6.6 WS Bass | 5 WS Hibbert | 4 WS   Let's do +/- 25% of those:  [ 23.6 Wins ] [+25% = 29.5 Wins ] [ -25% = 17.7 Wins ]  Not bad for a vet core. Now for our Sophomores:   Clarkson | 2.4 Black | 3.1   Now let's pretend both Randle and D'Angelo play as well as two superstars in their rookie outings:   Randle | 9.7 WS *  Russell | 5.4 WS *    Meanwhile our projects are a total of -2 WS.   [18.6 Wins ] [+25% = 23.25 Wins ] [-25%= 13.95]  So we're currently looking at a season of between 31 Wins and 53 Wins. That puts the Lakers at the 7th seed of the 2015 NBA Playoffs if everything breaks right. I think a lot of people aren't seeing us severely over OR under-achieving, meaning we go right at 42 wins and the 10th seed. One of the big hype factors that people will assuredly miss is that while Upshaw could be terrific, it's very unlikely he's a positive contributor his first year. For comparison, look at Rudy Gobert. There's a reason we weren't talking about him when he was so young and had talent in front of him on the roster.   Wright and Green have the exact same WS range -.5 to +6. That's the difference between playoffs and not. Rather than seeing more math, I think you get the point that a couple players that have huge on years can make the difference while a bad year can fuck you up.   But at the moment, there's no reason to shit on someone for their optimism. We've actually put together a pretty respectable roster all things considered.   Now if someone wanted to do a WS/48 and then figure out the likely total minutes played per person and then compare THAT to (82games x 48minutes) we can have another number to compare it to.  | * For comparison on Randle + Russell I used Blake Griffin and Damien Lillard's Win Shares from their Rookie Years."
lakers,3cgwib,rebeltrillionaire,0,Wed Jul 8 00:47:28 2015 UTC,You can't assume Russell and randle will do as well as two previous rookie of the year winners. And Kobes win share won't be even close to that high. Good post though.
lakers,3cgwib,BABYPUBESS,2,Wed Jul 8 00:59:10 2015 UTC,"True, it's a ridiculously high WS and it's why I asterisked them. But by combining the total to Clarkson and Black, and then giving them a total -2 WS (which is actually pretty big) and then saying their floor is a combined 14 Wins, it doesn't really feel wrong.   I mean imagine just Clarkson, Black, Randle, and Russell and one basic player that never really hurts you. I could see them winning 14 games. Maybe even 16. So maybe Russell and Randle are off but Clarkson and Black make up for it. I did make a separate post though where I start talking about coefficients that would make the projection much better.   Bottom line I was really trying to say, ""no need to shit on optimism, it's mathematically possible!"""
lakers,3cgwib,mario10x,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:13:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  I reallt hope our young guys do pan out like that, and they technically could, I just find it unlikely. But either way it will be a fun season to watch as long as everyone stays healthy."
lakers,3cgwib,StealthRUs,3,Wed Jul 8 02:23:36 2015 UTC,Lakers win on 6 games vs. Cavaliers
lakers,3cgwib,trulivin,5,Tue Jul 7 23:51:25 2015 UTC,"The best (and realistic) outcome for the future of this franchise is in 2015-2016:   Randle, Russell, and Upshaw all stay healthy and play well in their rookie seasons.  Clarkson and Black improve upon last season. Kobe sits out most of his final season. Hibbert plays the same as he played last season and we get a young player/picks when after trading him to the Clippers when they get desperate for center help.  We go into the tank and keep the top 3 pick and gear up on the path to contention in 2017.   Edit: a word"
lakers,3cgwib,pistolpete4407,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:12:27 2015 UTC,I get you with the best realistic Kobe but the best (unrealistic) is he plays and makes the younger players around him better by leading them from the back. I'll be over the moon if he isn't taking the most shots in the team by more than 5-6 a game.
lakers,3cgwib,unix04,2,Tue Jul 7 22:16:44 2015 UTC,I say we get the 8th seed. I know free agency didn't turn out the way we had hoped but somehow we ended up with a pretty talented roster.

lakers,3cecar,Scabandiri,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:19:00 2015 UTC,I wasn't saying that last year or the year before that.
lakers,3cecar,StealthRUs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:22:40 2015 UTC,"It's a year long audition for Hibbert. Worst case, he remains in his current form and just has a so-so season. Maybe he gets moved before the trade deadline to a surprise contender for assets, who knows. Best case, he goes back to his peak with Indy. Things get alot more interesting then, especially with S&T's during the summer. Couple this with Lou Will's extremely friendly contract and you can expect the Lakers to make a serious trade next summer. Again, this is all if Hibbert pans out.  That pick owed to Philly is as good as gone in my mind. Especially if Kobe manages to stay healthy."
lakers,3cecar,JHeezy19,-2,Tue Jul 7 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"If Kobe plays like he did last season, he's going to shoot us out of a lot of games."
lakers,3cecar,StealthRUs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:00:03 2015 UTC,"And if alot of games go down to the wire, much like all those close losses last season, Kobe can bring you W's in at least 20% of those games.  Not that it matters, this Lakers squad is still gonna lose alot of games. But it's still statiscally far fetched that the Lakers land another top 3 lottery pick next summer. You don't tank to help out Philly. The Kings already did that plenty."
lakers,3cecar,JHeezy19,0,Tue Jul 7 18:15:46 2015 UTC,"But it's still statiscally far fetched that the Lakers land another top 3 lottery pick next summer.    Statistically far fetched = something like a 5 % chance.  The chances of landing that top 3 pick were closer to 65 % before the acquisitions - which is the opposite of far fetched.  Now, I'd say it's closer to 35% - again, not far fetched, but mostly not likely.  I'm still going to pull for the tank to make this team do the right thing in spite of itself.    Still you, and a lot of people on here, talk about close games like were were thisclose to having a decent record while Philly was just getting blown out all the time as to why we couldn't tank.  Philly had 8 losses that were decided by 4 points or less which is the exact same number of close losses as the Lakers had last season.  If you look at losses by 5 points or less, Philly had more close losses than the Lakers last season (13 vs 11).  If anything we were unlucky (or lucky, depending on your perspective) that we didn't finish with a worse record than Philly.  So to say that we couldn't tank again or that it's far fetched is ridiculous.  We're still going to be a bad team."
lakers,3cecar,StealthRUs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:39:53 2015 UTC,"You just don't get it do you?  None of the Lakers acquisitions were terrible. Hibbert's an expiring deal; something literally any team looking clear cap space for the next FA class would take on. Lou Will is paid slightly higher than Nick Young. 29 out of 29 teams would prefer Lou Will over Nick Young. A great trade piece, if necessary. Brandon Bass was also brought over on a solid deal. You could make a case on why the Lakers should have fought for Ed Davis, but Bass has more experience with deeper runs to the playoffs.  Not to mention the same teams the Lakers were ""fighting"" for the worst spot last season, like Philly, Sac, or Minny, surely didn't get any better. But at the same time, teams like Portland, and more recently Dallas got significantly worse. Both of those teams are gonna be worse than last seasons' Kings.   So you'd rather see the team scramble every summer trying to make moves/sign FAs and throw a few more seasons away instead of slowly rebuilding and acquiring assets to have a better shot at FA? For what? A 65% shot at keeping your draft pick? And it's not like any of the recent acquisitions are suddenly gonna make the Lakers come close to sniffing 40 wins.  Given the current situation, it's better to do something rather than nothing and pray we still keep our pick. It'll be a nice bonus on top of everything else.  And it's pretty dumb to just look at game results. You don't even know what happened during those Philly games. A lot can happen during the 4th. But for a guy who just loves to generalize to get his point across it's really no surprise."
lakers,3cecar,JHeezy19,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:38:01 2015 UTC,"You just don't get it do you?   No, I get it.  You're the one who continues to be hard-headed.   None of the Lakers acquisitions were terrible.    I'm not saying they are terrible in and of themselves.  I'm just saying they are detrimental.  There's a difference.  Getting Hibbert for a 2nd round pick, some guys who will never play in the NBA, and some cash(?) is straight up theft.  Williams' and Bass' deals are quite reasonable.  In and of themselves, they are fine acquisitions.  But these guys probably add wins to a terrible team that would benefit in the long run a lot more from continuing to be terrible.     Not to mention the same teams the Lakers were ""fighting"" for the worst spot last season, like Philly, Sac, or Minny, surely didn't get any better.    You're kidding, right?     Philly will be slightly better - they got Stauskas and Okafor and Noel has a full year of experience under his belt.   Minnesota will definitely be better with all of their guys healthy and with Wiggins and LaVine also having a full year of experience under their belts and with Shabazz having 2 full years under his belt.   The Knicks will definitely be better with Carmelo back healthy and Afflalo on the team now.   Sacramento might be about the same.  They got rid of Landry and Thompson, but Cauley-Stein will be ready to contribute immediately, so they could be slightly better or slightly worse.  Cousins will start to enter his prime this year, so that could give Sac a few extra wins right there, but Rondo might offset those wins.  So, yeah, Sac could compete for bottom 3. Portland will be worse and might go into the tank, but they still have Lillard.  Don't know if they'll be bottom 3 bad, but they could be. Dallas will be worse, but they won't be bad enough to tank for bottom 3. They still have Dirk and Parsons and they signed Barea and Wesley Matthews and Richard Jefferson.   I could see them tanking for bottom 7 to keep the Celtics from getting their pick, but Carlisle is too good of a coach.  He will get the most out of that team.      So you'd rather see the team scramble every summer trying to make moves/sign FAs and throw a few more seasons away instead of slowly rebuilding and acquiring assets to have a better shot at FA?   In case you haven't been paying attention - tanking is rebuilding this team.  Are we better off because we signed Hibbert, Bass, and Williams?  Of course not.  Nobody gives a fuck about those guys.  People are more optimistic about this team because of Russell, Randle, and Clarkson - and those guys came through the draft, through tanking.   And it's not like any of the recent acquisitions are suddenly gonna make the Lakers come close to sniffing 40 wins.   True, but they potentially could make the Lakers come close to sniffing 30 wins, which would be disastrous to the long-term health of the franchise.  This pick is important.  It might be the last time we could have a chance to land a top 3 pick for a while, so I don't see why we should jeopardize it needlessly.  Going from 21 wins to 33 wins isn't going to make any A-list superstar want to sign with us.  The only way the LMAs, Lebrons, and Durants of the world are going to want to play here is if we draft and develop our own young players that could turn into superstars.     And it's pretty dumb to just look at game results. You don't even know what happened during those Philly games. A lot can happen during the 4th. But for a guy who just loves to generalize to get his point across it's really no surprise.   So, would you care to tell me what happened in those games?"

lakers,3cgoha,youretellingme,-4,Wed Jul 8 18:11:45 2015 UTC,we should trade hibbert to the clippers who are desperate. ask for Crawford and their 2019 first round pick. 2019 is the season when Blake and CP3 are both off the books. the team could break up and that pick could be excellent. we flip Crawford for a late first rounder and then sign Larry Sanders on a 3/21 with team options at the end of each season. give him a deal with incentives and lets use this Hibbert trade to land a lottery pick a few years down the line when well be too good to get one.

lakers,3ccg83,CapnGrundlestamp,9,Mon Jul 6 23:00:35 2015 UTC,"Honestly, drafting Russell was the best case scenario for Randle, and vice versa.  What people don't realize when it comes to developing rookies is that the first year or two is so huge when it comes to players picking up or shedding bad habits.  When you stick a talented rookie on a shitty ass team with no other options, often times the guy is relied on to carry the load and picks up a knack for taking too many bad shots, while focusing less on his defense and becoming a one-dimensional chucker.    Russell and Randle will be huge compliments for each other right out of the gate.  Russell could have ended up in Philly and been forced to be more of a shot-maker, taking tons of shots while negating his elite passing ability.  But because he has guys like Randle, Clarkson and Kobe to play with, he can focus more on being the facilitator that he was meant to be while being more patient and smart about his shots.    The same goes for Randle.  Sure he can score easy points off the fast break and his sweet face-up game hitting mid rangers or driving to the hoop, but ideally you don't want your power forward to be the guy to initiate his own shots.  With Russell, Randle now has a point guard that can find him in perfect positions on the court, making Randle less of an iso-player and helping him develop an off-ball midrange/pick and roll game that will be so valuable in taking his skillset to the next level.  Long story short, I am drooling at the thought of these guys learning to play with eachother over the next couple of years.  I can already imagine Russell setting easy pick and rolls for Randle, or Randle posting up, getting double teamed and whipping out a wide open three to Russell.  SUMMER LEAGUE CANNOT COME FASTER!!!!!!!!"

lakers,3ccnw5,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,0,Tue Jul 7 11:44:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know anyone who thinks it's a sure thing. I see a hell of a lot of future potential.

I've watched all year long at Kentucky and I'm not impressed. I love the kid but I don't like his game. Can he become an all-star? Yeah. Is he a sure thing like dumbasses like you say he is? Nope, far from it. I don't need to watch videos of him bricking shots in practice to tell he has a good jumpshot, or him dribbling around cones to tell he has a nasty handles."

lakers,3ccnw5,FuckTheClippers,6,Wed Jul 8 00:48:36 2015 UTC,Isn't Clarkson a free agent after the 15-16 season?
lakers,3ccnw5,TheMissingMeatball,20,Mon Jul 6 21:54:45 2015 UTC,He's a RFA next season. With Kobe coming off the books (as well as possibly Hibbert) I find it unlikely we won't match.
lakers,3ccnw5,badguymatt,11,Mon Jul 6 21:58:02 2015 UTC,Shit if he continues to develop the way he has been ill be outright pissed if we don't keep him
lakers,3ccnw5,jerkidiot,4,Mon Jul 6 22:16:20 2015 UTC,retaining JC is gonna be our number one priority this season. I bet we'll offer him a multi year contract a couple months into the season. Also there aren't a ton of teams sold as high on Clarkson as we are yet. I'm sure many people are going to be keeping an eye on him this season.  I expect us to lock him up pretty easily though. He seems to enjoy playing here and he's got a starting position on our line-up. I'd just do what Ant and Kawhi did and sign that contract before even talking to any other teams.
lakers,3ccnw5,badguymatt,3,Mon Jul 6 22:21:40 2015 UTC,I'm not sure we can. I think we have until like Oct or something. Then after that he hits the market in June.
lakers,3ccnw5,mes8007,2,Mon Jul 6 23:13:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you're right. If we're smart we'll do all we can to lock him up before the season begins."
lakers,3ccnw5,badguymatt,2,Tue Jul 7 00:27:28 2015 UTC,Clarkson is going to become such a better player bc of Russell.  Not only bc Russell will make everyone around him better but because of the completion aspect. Clarkson plays with a chip on his shoulder already and I bet he thinks he's better than Russell. I'm so ready for this year. Clarkson randle Russell plus the new additions.
lakers,3ccnw5,virji24,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:12:12 2015 UTC,How could we not re-sign Magic Johnson 2.0?
lakers,3ccnw5,Toomuchgamin,2,Tue Jul 7 16:49:19 2015 UTC,had the FO been willing to throw down an additional million for both '17 and '18 he could have been locked up for four years on the cheapest contract. FO saved 2M but will have to pay a lot more a lot sooner because of it.
lakers,3ccnw5,youretellingme,3,Mon Jul 6 23:37:13 2015 UTC,That's all hindsight though. FO would have been crucified if we signed him for 4 years and he ended up caving in. We made a solid bet and now we will pay up. I'm curious what kind of contract he will command though.
lakers,3ccnw5,KookLife,2,Tue Jul 7 00:59:13 2015 UTC,"I'm curious too, really depends on how good he is this year. But if Reggie Jackson just commanded 5 years $80M from Detroit and Brandon Knight got 5 years $70M from the Suns I'd imagine it could be a very big contract if he plays well. I don't think its hindsight. More savy GMs lock up their second round or undrafted assets on the cheap (under a million a season) for longer than two years. For example Morey in Houston who is a master of this gave Patrick Beverly a three year contract because he liked him and believed in him. As a result, he got to postpone Beverlys free agency for three seasons (which allowed him to take a stab at Chris Bosh last off-season). If he's not under the books for a third season as he was, Houston probably loses him in the first week of July while hunting for Bosh.  The Lakers believed enough in Clarkson to buy his rights for $1.7M, they should have followed through with the investment by tacking on one or two more years at $1M a season. nobody would have been crucified if he was on the books for another season even if he was a bust, it would have been a $1M contract in a league with a $90+M salary cap.  If Ebanks was good enough for a three year deal, we should have done it for Clarkson. The gain outweighed the risk ($2M over two seasons), they didn't play the gamble as well as they could have. But of course I can't complain too much, were lucky we got a guy like Clarkson that late in the second round. He made the rookie first team and six or seven of the first ten players selected in the lottery didn't."
lakers,3ccnw5,youretellingme,2,Tue Jul 7 01:10:42 2015 UTC,"Good points. If we did that with Ebanks, we should have definitely done that with Clarkson. I believe we did the same thing with Blue during the season as well (it may have been Brown, not sure)"
lakers,3ccnw5,KookLife,2,Tue Jul 7 01:23:19 2015 UTC,"thanks man. it's not my concept, Zach Lowe spent time on one of his podcasts talking about the sneaky value of 2nd round picks and how adding the extra year doesn't really hurt with the future bump in salary cap, especially if you're a big market team like the Lakers. with how rough free agency has been we don't have a lot of room for error in the structuring of the rebuild. this isn't an error it's just not ideal, thanks to Clarkson. I'm looking on basketball reference, Young, Randle, and Russell are the only guys signed past next season, unless it's wrong: http://www.basketball-reference.com/contracts/LAL.html"
lakers,3ccnw5,youretellingme,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:31:48 2015 UTC,"It's really interesting the level of planning and strategy that goes into constructing a roster. I haven't checked out any Lowe Posts yet but I know I will have to jump on it soon. Lou Williams will be on their for about 7 million a season for the next three years and Brandon Bass will likely have a similar contract, but that's just an assumption since I haven't seen any of the details released yet.  I hope we can make some good use of that cap space, but it will have to be a hail mary because I dont see rookies +lou will and brandon bass being enough to entice the durants of free agency. Really interested to see how this all plays out."

lakers,3ccnw5,evsoul,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:54:20 2015 UTC,And that's a good thing. He deserves to get paid.
lakers,3ccnw5,holyevilcow,2,Mon Jul 6 23:53:48 2015 UTC,it would have been more ideal for the Lakers to break the bank on him in 2018 as opposed to next off season.
lakers,3ccnw5,youretellingme,11,Mon Jul 6 23:54:45 2015 UTC,Right but that is only scary if both are actually good which we dont know if they are yet.
lakers,3ccnw5,rtrainer30,4,Mon Jul 6 22:20:31 2015 UTC,Did you not watch the Lakers last year? We know Jordan Clarkson is good.
lakers,3ccnw5,Incognitary,16,Mon Jul 6 23:17:35 2015 UTC,"No, we know he could be good. He was an all rookie guard who had as many uh oh moments as he had oh wow moments. We know the potential is there, but to say he's a legitimately good NBA player is still a bit of a stretch. He put up volume stats on a bad team, let's watch what he does this year and then we'll see where he's at."
lakers,3ccnw5,Chilled_Penguin,-2,Mon Jul 6 23:32:11 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if it was a trash team. That's such a bad excuse people always use for whatever reasons. What about all the other rookies putting up good numbers on trash teams. Does that just void Wiggins season now or what? What about the trash 2nd rounders on the 76ers who couldn't put up good numbers? He's shooting a good percentage on a bad team, shouldn't that be a feat in itself?"
lakers,3ccnw5,jayhawk-420,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:05:05 2015 UTC,"I think last year showed he will be worth keeping around, even if he maxes out as a rotation player.

lakers,3ccnw5,badguymatt,-2,Tue Jul 7 01:19:50 2015 UTC,Penny wasn't as explosive when he played with Kidd.  I thought you were comparing this JC/DR to Kidd/Penny
lakers,3ccnw5,jaysteezy24,3,Tue Jul 7 01:21:19 2015 UTC,It reminds me a lot of what PHX ran this season with Bledsoe & Dragic.  Bledsoe would be Clarkson with Russ as Dragic. (Albeit Bledsoes probably got a higher ceiling still than JC.)
lakers,3ccnw5,PaperDesk,6,Mon Jul 6 21:52:42 2015 UTC,the fact that these guys are both north of 6'5 gives me hope though.
lakers,3ccnw5,realniggacologne,2,Mon Jul 6 21:57:28 2015 UTC,"Imma be a homer here and say JC's ceiling can be comparable Bledsoe's. He didn't hit his stride until he turned 23, 2 years ago. And Clarkson just recently turned 23 and it took him half a season to showcase what he could do. Compare what Clarkson did the first half of his rookie season and then compare it to the second of half of rookie season and you see a huge difference in improvement."
lakers,3ccnw5,death_by_laughs,3,Mon Jul 6 21:57:54 2015 UTC,"Very very true. I'm not trying to sound like a JC hater, cause I fucking adore everything about the kid haha. I would love for him to be the player that Bledsoe is today (and maybe even better.) I do know one thing though, we'll get a way better feel for how good JC actually is this season."
lakers,3ccnw5,badguymatt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I know you aren't hating, you're just trying to be as real as possible when you look at our players and not expect them to be like the next superstar player in the league. I definitely think he can be a better player than Bledsoe now, hes taller and just as athletic, and I think he can play make a lot better than Bledsoe could. Bledsoe thrived with a secondary ball handler and was not as good without Dragic or Knight next to him. In the small sample size we got from Clarkson, he looked like he can handle the team as the sole point guard, and was even good when he lined up with another point guard. But yeah we just gotta wait for the reg season to start and watch him play a full season."
lakers,3ccnmt,brandoi,80,Mon Jul 6 21:44:37 2015 UTC,Would just be the right decision..

lakers,3ccnmt,Dmanning2,10,Mon Jul 6 23:14:19 2015 UTC,Didn't Blake Griffin have a similar situation? Or did he not even play a regular season game?   Edit: he broke his knee cap in the final preseason game so he technically never played. Still seems like you should have to of played at least a full game to be considered a rookie haha.
lakers,3ccnmt,evsoul,59,Tue Jul 7 05:56:10 2015 UTC,Randle and Russell Co-ROTY confirmed
lakers,3ccnmt,WLVTrojanMan,33,Mon Jul 6 21:52:13 2015 UTC,"I can see if they don't allow it on a technicality and wouldn't hold it against them, but it'd be really nice of them to let him compete given the circumstances."

lakers,3ccnmt,itsSMITTY,10,Tue Jul 7 08:35:59 2015 UTC,"Gonna be a tough feat with Towns, Russell & my personal favorite darkhorse Mario Hezonja. Would have been much much harder with a 100% healthy Embiid challenging him for the spot as well, but I have no clue what's going on with his health.   Edit: Regardless, that'd be awesome for them to allow him to compete for ROTY."
lakers,3ccnmt,badguymatt,9,Mon Jul 6 21:55:15 2015 UTC,"Hezonja is such a beast. If Lakers would've fallen to 5, I was all in for picking him. But I feel like the resigning of Tobias Harris might stunt his growth a little. I feel like he's a starter. Was I the only one who saw his game winner/big shot this past weekend?"
lakers,3ccnmt,mister_greyMATTER,2,Mon Jul 6 22:36:53 2015 UTC,Hezonja is going to be like a new Drazen Petrovic.  I hope his career isn't like Drazen's though.

lakers,3ccnmt,avanhokie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:23:05 2015 UTC,"Well the end of his career was actually pretty good and he was finally getting the playing time to show how awesome he really was, which makes his sudden death even more tragic.  Most of his career he warmed the bench."
lakers,3ccnmt,aveydey,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:44:33 2015 UTC,"Ah I see, I just assumed you were talking about the tragic loss of his life. I apologize."

lakers,3ccnmt,aveydey,2,Tue Jul 7 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"Hezonja doesn't need all 3936 minutes to develop though. That's the mistake a ton of teams make when they build through the draft and the reason why I'm very against any talk of moving Clarkson.   The NBA season is overly long. Like literally 22 games too long, maybe even more.   Harris will be on a very good contract if he keeps producing, and while you'll never put up insane per/game numbers or totals, fans are starting to realize how important efficiency, per-possession, and even per36 are. If Harris can't be productive in less games or less minutes or off the bench, or Hezonja can't but looks like he's got a higher ceiling. Having Harris as a trade trip vs. cap space is a no-brainer, you want him as a trade chip."
lakers,3ccnmt,rebeltrillionaire,3,Mon Jul 6 23:34:54 2015 UTC,I think Hezonja will take a couple seasons to find his game. I think Stanley Johnson and Myles Turner will surprise people though.
lakers,3ccnmt,ChuckEJesus,3,Tue Jul 7 01:34:01 2015 UTC,Don't forget about Okafor. He went 20/9 tonight and 7-9 in the second half.
lakers,3ccnmt,DariosDentist,2,Tue Jul 7 04:08:41 2015 UTC,yeah............ Makes me wonder if we got the right pick... I wanted Okafor. Hope I'm wrong.
lakers,3ccnmt,Icarosz,3,Tue Jul 7 14:59:47 2015 UTC,"I wanted Okafor too man, but Mitch knows what he's doing.  As soon as they got Hibbert I felt better about everything.  Mitch is trying to build Showtime for the 2010s and you need a flashy passser with high IQ and great court vision for that.  Russell was probably the right call if we want to be able to compete against Steph, Klay and the Golden State Warriors."

lakers,3ccnmt,Based_joe,7,Tue Jul 7 16:46:33 2015 UTC,It's crazy the way the NBA works on this. They should do it like they do in baseball. There should be a minimal amount of minutes a player can play without ruining their eligibility. Maybe 100 minutes or so.

lakers,3ccnmt,aeisenst,7,Tue Jul 7 17:26:11 2015 UTC,"there's literally no advantage or positive for Randle to ""take a year off"" his career. from an on the court perspective, there's no need to try and out shine other rookies, he's already mature for his age. however, more importantly, from a business perspective, Randle would be more inclined to be labeled a 2nd year player because he'll get to the 7 year mark needed for max player contract consideration. why wait an extra year for more money. just doesn't make sense to me for that reason"
lakers,3ccnmt,stafreshi,3,Tue Jul 7 04:58:06 2015 UTC,"I suppose that the Derrick Rose rule could be a factor if Randle is confident enough in himself, but otherwise I think you're right and I wonder why I never thought about this before.  EDIT: Now that I think about it some more, does the league's designation of rookie status actually affect a team's contract or is it just based on actual calendar time?"
lakers,3ccnmt,retrofuturist,3,Tue Jul 7 06:03:06 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter, going to D'Angelo anyways. Randle will be a reason that Russell gets it though. Russell leading in rookie assist, mostly to Randle."

lakers,3ccnmt,badguymatt,0,Mon Jul 6 22:03:47 2015 UTC,"Before OP deleted his comment, he said something along the lines of: ""what NBA player would ever want to be considered a rookie in their second year.""  Nerlens Noel &amp;amp; Blake Griffin are two guys who qualified as a rookie in their true second contract year in the NBA. (Two guys with ceilings higher than Randle, might I add.) so yeah.   And sorry, Noel's defensive ceiling is higher than Randle's offensive ceiling, and that's the only reason I say that. I love Julius. I think he's going to be an amazing player. You people need to realize that Nerlens Noel & Blake Griffin is not bad company.."
lakers,3ccnmt,MrDaveyHavoc,3,Mon Jul 6 22:06:15 2015 UTC,They didn't play a single game.  What does their ceiling have to do with this?
lakers,3ccnmt,badguymatt,-4,Mon Jul 6 22:07:13 2015 UTC,"So you compare that to Julius' 1/2 game, and he hasn't played a game either. Your logic is ridiculous. Their ceilings matter because of your logic. You said Randle wouldn't want to be considered a rookie so that he could hit FA ASAP to get paid. People aren't going to pay off a small sample size. And their ceilings do matter.  If your logic were true, why would Nerlens Noel & Blake Griffin take the role of rookie in their second year, if they could just hit FA and make literally tons more than Julius off ceiling alone?  Your logic is wrong regardless. While there's a chance Julius is considered a rookie this year, he's still a second-year player."
lakers,3ccnmt,DovhPasty,2,Mon Jul 6 22:13:23 2015 UTC,Draymond Green begs to differ when it comes to people not paying for a small sample size..
lakers,3ccnmt,badguymatt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:25:24 2015 UTC,Draymond Green played juuuust a little more than 14 minutes before he got paid.
lakers,3ccnmt,thesplashman,2,Mon Jul 6 22:30:16 2015 UTC,I don't see how you can watch Noel on offense and definitively say he has a higher ceiling than Randle.
lakers,3ccnmt,badguymatt,-1,Tue Jul 7 00:04:02 2015 UTC,"Sorry man, I didn't really mean it like that. I find the ceilings of Nerlens & Julius to be pretty close. But let's be real. Nerlens is one of the best defensive big-men to enter the draft in years.   If Julius can improve on his defense (and he's young, he should be able to.) it'll be a different story.   Noel plays elite defense, and as of right now Julius is yet to truly be elite at anything. So that's what I meant by that.  People need to realize that Blake Griffin & Nerlens Noel is damn good company. I think Julius is gonna be a great player in the league and potential all-star."
lakers,3ccnmt,randy88moss,4,Tue Jul 7 00:19:23 2015 UTC,"Even if you miss your entire first season, you are contractually a 2nd year player."
lakers,3ccnmt,MrDaveyHavoc,2,Mon Jul 6 22:59:17 2015 UTC,Right.
lakers,3ccnmt,jsun_,2,Tue Jul 7 00:26:06 2015 UTC,"Being a rookie doesn't delay his free agency. He is in year 2 of his contract. All rookies are signed to 2 year deals with a 3rd year option. If the 3rd year option is picked up, the team can then pick up a 4th year option. Then they become restricted free agents. Even if he qualifies for the ROY award he is still in the 2nd year of his contract."
lakers,3ccnmt,MrDaveyHavoc,0,Mon Jul 6 22:13:52 2015 UTC,"Of course not. But we turned a flippant remark into a CBA lesson, so at least we got some content out of it."
lakers,3cel4a,rebeltrillionaire,2,Tue Jul 7 08:31:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, with the cap going up by as much as it is, next season it will be literally impossible to sign RFA's. Which is too bad as Kidd-Gilchrist seems like he'd fit our roster perfectly as a defense first wing."
lakers,3cel4a,Notalent13,3,Tue Jul 7 09:55:13 2015 UTC,RFAs are next to impossible to sign anyway
lakers,3cel4a,MrDaveyHavoc,2,Tue Jul 7 16:55:19 2015 UTC,"The only ways are:    Stupid FO  Player wanting out   The Hornets are a mess. Their team looks like it is completely directionless. Even if certain players are individually good, it seems like they don't fit together at all.   If MKG doesn't want to be there and Charlotte just lets him walk (stupidly...like Biyombo) then we have an outside shot. But other than that, no, it's a small margin for all RFA's."
lakers,3cel4a,badguymatt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:09:50 2015 UTC,"Idk, I think Harrison Barnes could be a possibility. Even with the cap going up I don't see GSW matching him up to a max (if we wanna take him there). I mean I definitely could be wrong, but it almost seemed like they were a little reluctant to hit Draymond with the max, and he's their 3rd most important player, you may be able to make the argument for 2nd. I could see them trying to upgrade at the 5 and go with Horford."
lakers,3cel4a,MrDaveyHavoc,0,Tue Jul 7 10:56:38 2015 UTC,How many RFAs switch teams?
lakers,3cel4a,FuckTheClippers,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:55:44 2015 UTC,Odom did but that's after he begged the Clippers not to match it
lakers,3cel4a,badguymatt,0,Tue Jul 7 18:22:13 2015 UTC,"How many times has Steph Curry won the MVP before last season? Shit changes, homie. Perhaps they want in on the KD stakes."
lakers,3cel4a,Notalent13,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:16:22 2015 UTC,"More likely the Warriors being a mid tier market will find it hard to justify paying for Harrison Barnes when they will need to find money to reup Curry with the new max. Remember that this Warriors roster is only possible as it is right now because Curry is making nowhere near his value. I don't know how deep their owners pockets are, but 35 million is still a huge paycheck and that's supposedly where the max will be when Curry hits the market."
lakers,3cel4a,MrDaveyHavoc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:32:49 2015 UTC,"They are overflowing in both TV revenue and championship related revenue right now, in addition to ownership money. If you consider the Bay Area as a whole and not just Oakland their market is just fine."
lakers,3cel4a,MrDaveyHavoc,0,Tue Jul 7 19:37:23 2015 UTC,"A truly laughable comparison. The RFA system is the same every year. No rule changes are set to take place regarding RFAs between now and next year. We have seen that this system almost always ends with the RFA back with their team, assuming they are any good. Not comparable to a player increasing his performance from year to year at all.  Where are the Warriors getting all this extra money?"
lakers,3cel4a,badguymatt,0,Tue Jul 7 18:22:45 2015 UTC,"It's not hard to make things work. They were going to do it for Dwight. I find it laughable that you think you know exactly what will happen next season; and then you even slipped an ""almost always"" into your sentence. While we're at it I'd like for you to tell me LA's final record next season and who the champ will be.   I find it laughable that you automatically expect them to max Harrison Barnes when there were talks about Barnes being initially thrown into a package to dump David Lee.   I find it laughable that you think they'd automatically max him out rather than saving said cap space as well, adding it to the cap spike, dumping one more contract like Andrew Bogut to make room for KD, if they can't trade Lee then he also comes off the books next season. It can happen. They are most definitely trying to get into the KD sweepstakes."
lakers,3cel4a,MrDaveyHavoc,0,Tue Jul 7 18:30:26 2015 UTC,"Dwight was not a RFA so he's not germane to this discussion.  It's laughable to compare a controlled, contracted CBA function to the wild fluctuations in player performance.  RFAs of value do not move the vast majority of the time.  Betting on this trend to break is a sucker play."
lakers,3cel4a,badguymatt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:33:52 2015 UTC,"You're right there. But I wasn't referring to Dwight as being an RFA, I just meant that GS was willing to make room to accommodate Dwight if he wanted to come over. Same as they'd wanna do for Durant.   Regardless, I think Harrison is more-so a system guy anyways, and I think there are better unrestricted options available next season.   Sorry not trying to come off as a dick my dude, just got my wisdom teeth taken out this morning so I haven't been in the most agreeable mood all day lol.   Edit: just wanted to let you know I'm not over here downvoting you.  I don't downvote discussion."
lakers,3cel4a,MrDaveyHavoc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"Oh if a superstar wants to come they will find a way. I just think the way isn't to give up players of value for nothing like not matching an RFA sheet would be. I assume if Durant wants to come and HB is going to be the sacrifice then they'd try to S/T him to someone else for an asset or even to OKC in the Durant deal.  No worries, it's all in fun.  I downvote for bad content not for disagreeable ideas so we are simpatico."

lakers,3cel4a,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:51:42 2015 UTC,"If the Lakers got MKG, I can't imagine the amount of complaining we'd hear. He probably has the brokest jumper in the NBA."
lakers,3cel4a,aveydey,2,Tue Jul 7 23:11:35 2015 UTC,KD and whoever KD wants to bring with him.
lakers,3cel4a,StealthRUs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:02:07 2015 UTC,"He checks a lot of boxes for us, and Miami may really just not have the cash to compete for him.    Miami will have the cash and will be able to offer more money to him   Whiteside will be eligible for a maximum salary of slightly less than 25% of the 2016 salary cap for a player in the 0-6 year experience tier, and being as Whiteside will not meet full veteran qualifying free agent qualifications, the max contract length either Miami or any other team can offer is 4 years, albeit Miami can offer an increased 7.5% annual raise over 4.5% of everyone else.  Thus, while Whiteside will be an unrestricted free agent in 2016, the scenario actually works out well for the Heat, for if Whiteside was a restricted free agent this coming offseason, the Heat likely would not have had the means to match his expected offer, and his success story in Miami would end."
lakers,3cel4a,FreshDiamond,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:44:05 2015 UTC,I don't believe you would  have to renounce  bird rights. The way free agency works everything is figured out before it can happen. If you knew Kobe was going to take a ten million dollar deal you could simply agree to terms that would put you over the cap with other players when accounting for the cap holds. Then when you are actually allowed to sign players you would sign Kobe first then by cap hold. I could be wrong but that makes sense to me.
lakers,3cel4a,MrDaveyHavoc,2,Tue Jul 7 16:25:34 2015 UTC,"The order of operations obviously matters, but technically Kobe would either have to be released or re-signed to reduce his 25+MM cap hold. You need to do this before technically signing other players, but it's just paperwork."
lakers,3cel4a,FreshDiamond,2,Tue Jul 7 16:57:34 2015 UTC,Isn't that what I said?
lakers,3cel4a,MrDaveyHavoc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:15:29 2015 UTC,"Just pointing out that relinquishing of Bird rights or not is unimportant, assuming it's his last deal."

lakers,3cel4a,AvrupaFatihi,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:03:28 2015 UTC,In a perfect world we'd be able to offer Kobe a 1y player option contract this season already and not have his cap hold next off-season
lakers,3cel4a,MrDaveyHavoc,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:54:48 2015 UTC,I don't know what that means.  His contract is in place already so it can't be renegotiated. Are you saying you wish his last contract had a 1 year option at the end? because the cap hold is there regardless
lakers,3cel4a,joelee1711,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:29:44 2015 UTC,"We'll have space for two max contracts next summer, so in order to get KD we'll need to have a supporting cast talented enough to jump to title contention if he signs.  Hopefully we learn from our mistakes from the past years, because if adding a big free agent won't even guarantee us a playoff spot, much less a chance at a title, they won't come.    A name that I think you're missing is Al Horford.  He'll be 30, but his game will age well and I think he's worth spending on to try and make our team more appealing and ""win now"" to Durant.  Of course, a lot of this hinges on the development of our young guys, mainly Russell, Clarkson, and Randle.  If they can show their tantalizing talent and growth this year, that'll make our pitch to big FAs sooo much easier.  P.S., Jeff Green also becomes a FA in 2016 too.  His value has gone way down so it might be worth a shot to pick him up early in free agency because I think Durant and him are close."
lakers,3cel4a,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:41:38 2015 UTC,"In other words next year's FA's won't be great outside of Conley, KD, and Horford... and Whiteside isn't that good man."

lakers,3cefdk,SwirlPiece_McCoy,2,Tue Jul 7 08:26:56 2015 UTC,"You know to me it's not so much /r/lakers spewing the hate, it's ESPN/Grantland/LA Times going way too overboard in their ""analysis"". They already have winners and Losers and the FA period isn't over yet. We can somehow get Anderson from Dallas or maybe Napier from the Heat (just examples fellas) and the haters (Adande, Plaschke, Elhassan) would still write a column about how we were the big losers in FA cause Monroe, DJ, LMA turned us down even though we only really went after DJ/LMA. In my opinion we gave a half assed meeting to Monroe and hurried back to the DJ meeting. Calling the Lakers or even the Knicks losers in the FA market so far is just click bait crap."

lakers,3cefdk,WOX_69,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:25:29 2015 UTC,"I'm also a Dodgers fan...and their rebuild (although without the cap and international signing ability) is much easier to accomplish with money than it is for the Lakers.    But there is something that feels lacking on this team with the way that we pushed some home grown Dodgers to the side.  Kemp was my favorite player, even though he isn't the star he used to be.  Dee Gordon was another.  Sure, I want the Dodgers to win, but it feels better when you do it with your own guys.    The Lakers have had the feeling for me a lot, too.  Of course, we traded or signed major players (Kareem, Shaq, Pau, etc.).  But we also had drafted cornerstones as a part of the franchise for 30 of the past 40 years (Kobe, Magic, Worthy).    That gives this team potential to replace Kobe with one of our own guys.  If Randle and Russell end up the stars we hope they are, it will be more satisfying as a fan.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm really hopeful.  As an adult, I got to enjoy some great relationships with the Lakers.  With my young kids, they'll probably start to get interested in the next 3 years...so I'm hoping that we have an exciting team of young Laker lifers ready for them to cheer on for the next 10 - 15 years."

lakers,3cefdk,SevTheNiceGuy,0,Tue Jul 7 19:41:56 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, people act like we've never had this issue before. I'd say 2016/2017 FA is when we really start making moves. Resign Kobe at a discount  for 5-7 million a year. Sign max free agents, I'd say we should shoot for Cousins in 2017 and a SF in 2016/2017 depending on how our young core develops. This could make us favorites in the 17-18 season with a young core that can contend for years. It may not be what people want to hear, but the reality is we need to let our young guys develop before we can really lure any notable FAs. The earliest we contend is the 16-17 season with a more realistic 17-18. I have a strong feeling we can lure Cousins. Now of course Cousins shouldn't be our own target since that's a huge gamble and that we should be going for any good max FAs we can get (championship caliber, not guys like Tobias Harris and TT)."

lakers,3cbjmk,rameninside,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:04:18 2015 UTC,"Isn't Randle considered a rookie as well, seeing as how he only played a few minutes last season? I'm asking because I'm pretty sure that's how it works in baseball (my understanding is that you need a certain number of games in a season in order to be considered to have completed your rookie year), is that also how it works in basketball?"
lakers,3cbjmk,Musingmike,3,Mon Jul 6 22:00:27 2015 UTC,Even 1 second played means he cant be classified as a rookie.
lakers,3cbjmk,deadmicedance,2,Tue Jul 7 00:03:47 2015 UTC,That's weird. At least MLB has a decent system. NBA needs to look into adjusting theirs.

lakers,3cd79t,spudwinkle,21,Tue Jul 7 01:04:54 2015 UTC,Anthony Brown's got a sweet stroke. Hopefully he'll fit into the 3/D role - since (at least at the moment) we don't really got a SF who defends.
lakers,3cd79t,ss3happy1,4,Tue Jul 7 00:58:44 2015 UTC,"He's going to be playing 35 minutes a game by the All-Star break. Especially if Kobe stays healthy this year. We're going to need more shooting and perimeter defense. Especially with Kobe on the floor.  I can only see Kobe playing the 3 if the other team has a non-threat at SF. If we're playing OKC or SAS or the like, Kobe has to play a guard spot and we need to bring in a forward to defend the SF.   Clarkson and Russell are just not big enough to guard a larger wing player like that, and Kobe can't be asked to defend any perimeter scoring threat at this stage in his career."
lakers,3cd79t,amarstan,9,Tue Jul 7 07:01:31 2015 UTC,so hyped for our backcourt duo and randle.

lakers,3cgw57,Thehomelesshobo,3,Tue Jul 7 20:34:29 2015 UTC,"I'll offer you some constructive criticism here. I'm a designer as well.   I think the first one is the cleanest. It uses our color scheme pretty well. That being said, I would lower the contrast between Ju and the background for sure. You could add depth into this piece by giving off a soft light source at the top left, as well as adding some text into the piece. To add the most depth in here it might do you some good to add a couple linear spots behind him as well.   I've never been the best at critiquing from my phone where I'm not able to actually toy around with the image or even see the image while I'm commenting this.   Have you ever looked into vectoring?

lakers,3ccxb1,Scabandiri,15,Mon Jul 6 22:57:08 2015 UTC,I love how articulate Randle is. He has a confident presence that comes across in his tone. Randle just exudes star power. It would be hard for me to believe he wont be anything but successful. Now how successful will have to wait and see.
lakers,3ccxb1,bornduringwinter,12,Mon Jul 6 23:42:42 2015 UTC,I agree. Randle sounds like a mature guy who can handle the grind of an NBA season. He reminds me of Fish in that respect.

lakers,3ce6gv,_im_on_acid_,13,Tue Jul 7 05:27:27 2015 UTC,I don't care who we trade with or who we help. As long it improves our team I'm all for it
lakers,3ce6gv,njain4,2,Tue Jul 7 05:51:01 2015 UTC,"Amen, I find myself getting to caught up in which players we should go for."
lakers,3ce6gv,Riles26,4,Tue Jul 7 16:06:40 2015 UTC,"Or we could just not even send them Jordan Hill. If they have to make than Haywood trade in order to actually play Haywood, I'm gonna laugh my ass off.   Sorry Clips fans creeping in, I don't actually hate y'all that much. I know the feels when you lose your dominant big man over disputes between him & a guy who wants literally nothing more than to win. :(   I'm okay with sending them Swaggy & letting them make their own move for a 5. Swaggy is someone we need to let go. But I'm not about to do a S&T just to lend a helping hand. Maybe if we ""still had"" CP3 ;)"
lakers,3ce6gv,badguymatt,0,Tue Jul 7 06:57:37 2015 UTC,"I know the feels when you lose your dominant big man over disputes between him & a guy who wants literally nothing more than to win.    You say that as if Shaq didn't want to win, also."
lakers,3ce6gv,StealthRUs,3,Tue Jul 7 13:57:39 2015 UTC,"It was more in reference to Dwight as well. It does apply to Shaq because he and Kobe did not get along at the end of it. Kinda just a vague statement, may not have been the best example."
lakers,3ce6gv,badguymatt,0,Tue Jul 7 14:24:00 2015 UTC,"Oh.  My mind automatically went to Shaq, because by the time we got Dwight he was no longer dominant."
lakers,3ce6gv,StealthRUs,2,Tue Jul 7 14:29:45 2015 UTC,We can trade away Nick Young without helping the Cavs and Clippers.
lakers,3ce6gv,WOX_69,4,Tue Jul 7 05:31:16 2015 UTC,"While I don't want to help those teams, there arent teams lining up to trade for swaggy.  If we do find someone to take him, I see no other way to do it without either taking back salary or giving up picks.  If the cavs want him this would get rid of him free and clear"
lakers,3ce6gv,SSD65,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:37:42 2015 UTC,This might be possible because JR might request too much and the cavs need a shooter.
lakers,3ce6gv,JHeezy19,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:13:42 2015 UTC,"If you need a shooter, why would you even consider Nick Young?"
lakers,3ce6gv,StealthRUs,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:09:00 2015 UTC,Young is such a huge downgrade from JR.
lakers,3ce6gv,StealthRUs,0,Tue Jul 7 13:58:12 2015 UTC,"Young is a big downgrade on his own, I'm not sure the Cavs would want him.  Crawford and Swaggy together is an upgrade over smith, it's instant offense off the bench at 2 positions instead of just 1.  That also means they don't have to pay JR and can have a slightly less big tax bill this year and repeater tax bill down the road by giving JR multiple years. Crawford is an expiring and Swaggy next year is cheaper than what they'd get JR for, plus they can get out of Swaggy after next year to decrease their tax bill.    They're trading Haywood no matter what and have been linked to Crawford, but that doesn't work on its own.  We could make it work money wise, but it just depends on if they want to include us for either swaggy or Sacre/kelly."
lakers,3ce6gv,WOX_69,2,Tue Jul 7 15:35:05 2015 UTC,"Who would take him?  He came to the Lakers for the vet minimum for a reason, and now we're paying him $5 million/year."
lakers,3ce6gv,lakers__sad_summer,2,Tue Jul 7 13:59:06 2015 UTC,I have faith that we can fool someone into taking him.
lakers,3ce6gv,evsoul,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:00:08 2015 UTC,"I've heard the Lakers are already having a lot on the books with Hibbert, Lou and Bass coming. Is this a move just to clear space?  Also, I'd kinda lean toward keeping Swaggy if him alone doesn't land a 2nd rounder. 9mil over a few years isn't too bad for an overall avg player off the bench. He can even compete with Lou and we'll see who the better man is."
lakers,3ce6gv,evsoul,3,Tue Jul 7 05:49:56 2015 UTC,"This would clear space by sending out Scare and Kelly, possibly swaggy before doing those other deals.  If all three of them are sent out it could free up about $6mil in cap space.    The front office wants to dump swaggy and some other salary.  Swaggy and Lou seems like a redundancy to have, and not a good one.  Both are bench scorers and both need the ball, by having both play it'll take away touches from the rookies and slow down the offense."
lakers,3ce6gv,JHeezy19,2,Tue Jul 7 06:00:19 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think this helps us enough to justify helping the stupid Clippers."
lakers,3ce6gv,lakers__sad_summer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:26:22 2015 UTC,He's still owed about 15 over the next 3 years. He signed a 4 year $21mill contract.
lakers,3ce6gv,JHeezy19,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:23:11 2015 UTC,"What.  Lou's just coming off a 6th Man award. It's not even a question who the better player is.  I don't think people realize how good a deal Lou's signing was. Solid bench guy sitting on a cap friendly contract? He can bring either roster depth or be a valuable trade asset, something the Lakers haven't had in awhile.  And fuck Nick Young."
lakers,3ce6gv,barath_s,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:06:48 2015 UTC,There's a lot animousity towards NY. Just saying he's on a good contract and can create his own shot. That type of player is still going for a lot in the FA market.
lakers,3ce6gv,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Tue Jul 7 18:26:07 2015 UTC,"We just signed a unquestionably better player that brings similiar skills, but can also pass.  And no, Nick Young won't demand ""a lot"" in free agency. His market value has been low even before coming to the Lakers.  And there's a reason people don't like him. He talks a whole bunch of shit but doesn't do shit on the court. The way he carries himself makes me think I wouldn't like him if I knew him personally.  He had one job; help the Lakers tank. He played his part beautifully. Now it's time to part ways."
lakers,3ce6gv,barath_s,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:41:18 2015 UTC,We waived bird rights on Jordan hill. Plus clippers over the tax. So no sign and trade
lakers,3ce6gv,dalas3322,2,Tue Jul 7 14:26:52 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if we waived his bird rights or not, because of the moratorium no deals have been made and we have $24ish million in cap space.  This deal wouldn't add salary to our cap sheet, it would subtract salary by dumping some combination of kelly/sacre/swaggy and then waiving Haywood's non-guaranteed contract.  We could do this deal before signing Lou and trading for Hibbert and free up additional cap space.  Clippers being over the tax doesn't matter, they are sending out Crawford and can take back up to 125% of his $5.675mil salary, or a little over $7million.  That should be enough for Hill at this point without many other free agency options, if they also send out Wilcox and his $1mil salary that means they can take back another $1.25 mil in additional salary for Hill ($8.25mil) or a Sacre/kelly contract"
lakers,3ce6gv,rtrainer30,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:45:50 2015 UTC,"Nice work, sir."
lakers,3ce6gv,rtrainer30,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can sign and trade somebody else's free agent,  which is what hill essentially is right now. Sign someone and you have to keep him 90 days.  Also clippers being repeatedly over tax may restrict what they can take back in a sign and Trade under new cba.  But the primary reason lakers can't sign and trade hill after waiving bird rights is that they no longer have cap space to do so. Hill is going to need more than 9 million cap space to sign. Lets see  I don't think lakers can delay lou and Hibbert..  They are unsigned now only because of league moratorium to figure out the cap till July 8.  Tell you what, do you wanna bet that July 9, lakers S and t hill?"
lakers,3ce6gv,rtrainer30,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:25:55 2015 UTC,"i'm fine with getting rid of kelly/young contracts but why sacre, he is so cheap like 800k i think and a serviceable back up big.  i don't mind helping clips since were not in the running for playoffs and hill on teh clippers doesn't even get close to replacing jordan"
lakers,3ce6gv,FuckTheClippers,2,Tue Jul 7 17:56:21 2015 UTC,"At this point in Sacre's career there isn't any upside.  What you see is what you get, a 7 foot dude who can foul 6 times in a game and is fun to watch on the bench.  Hibbert will get most of the minutes at the 5, but Upshaw and Black should be getting minutes ahead of Sacre.  We are also at 15 roster spots right now after the bass signing, we need to free up a spot to actually sign Upshaw.  Dumping Sacre and Kelly frees up the roster spot for upshaw and another $2.7mil in cap space to go after another Brandon Bass type vet/locker room guy or another young player."

They had a bad offseason, but ensuring Lilliard doesn't see FA was big for them. Now they can rebuild in relative peace.  The real biggest loser was the Kings. They've got a coaching crisis, a superstar who wants to leave, and oh yeah they made a terrible deal with the 76'ers so that they could get cap space they weren't actually able to use for anybody who can actually improve the team. In the end they had to make due with Rajon Rondo, on a relatively expensive 1 year deal."

lakers,3cdsgk,IMjudas,27,Tue Jul 7 17:21:01 2015 UTC,Resoundingly disagree. We by no means hit a home run but we are without a doubt better than we were last year. Clippers are still a better team then the Lakers but they've gotten worse. The trailblazers lost 4 of their 5 starters. The Knicks have had a horrible off season. People just like to shit on us.

ESPN is making a bigger deal out of this than it seems.  Stars don't want to waste their prime years rebuilding the Knicks/Lakers.  Give it time and we'll be good with space and we'll attract a star"
lakers,3cdsgk,locallyunknown,17,Tue Jul 7 03:20:26 2015 UTC,"how? we moved from 4 to 2 in the draft taking russell. We signed hibbert, williams, bass and possibly taj gibson. What about the trailblazers who just lost 4 of their 5 starters. Who votes on this? ESPN?"

lakers,3cdsgk,likwidsage,2,Tue Jul 7 11:19:51 2015 UTC,"I have a hunch he's referring to the unconfirmed rumors that the Lakers are working on a deal to send Lin/Hill to the Bulls in a S&T. /u/lakerswiz posted a tweet from some Chicago sports personality the other day claiming the deal was already done and just waiting for the moratorium to end, but it wasn't announced who they would be receiving in return.   With the Bulls having shopped Taj last year and just recently drafting Portis, it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility that Taj is that return player.  Not sure offhand if/how he would fit into our cap without further trades (we're already having a hard time clearing enough space for Hibbert, Lou and Bass), but if we got him, I do believe we could mount a serious push for #8.   A lineup of      PG SG SF PF C    Russell Kobe Randle Taj Hibbert   Clarkson Lou A. Brown Bass Black    J. Brown  Nance Upshaw    definitely has a chance. Doubt it happens though."

No one cares about big market appeal, the Laker brand is dying.""   That's all nonsense, and it requires you to not have any sense of nuance. The Lakers had a fine offseason, I'm not even sure getting LMA would've been a good thing but missing out on DAJ, etc. does hurt. But their draft was great and they picked up some solid pieces to field a more competitive team.  The Lakers brand isn't dead. It just doesn't override basketball reasons: A 30-year old power forward isn't coming to a rebuilding team, Lakers or not. That doesn't mean that their brand is tarnished; it just means LMA isn't an idiot.  If you take away that stupid narrative and look at the actual personnel rosters, no way did the Lakers have the worst offseason. But again, sportswriters will run with whatever narrative, so that's the one we get."

And, he's on one year. I like it and think it's a smidge better than what I dreamt up.  Getting Lou, possibly getting value out of Lin, Hill, and Swaggy would overall surpass my expectations for the FA offseason (bc the lotto and draft) overall made the offseason good."

This is to prevent a loophole, in a manner similar to free agent amounts (see question number 39). A team can't act like it's under the cap and sign free agents using cap room, and then use their Disabled Player, Bi-Annual, Mid-Level and/or trade exceptions. Consequently, the exceptions are added to their team salary (putting the team over the cap) if the team is under the cap and adding the exceptions puts them over the cap. If a team is already over the cap, then the exceptions are not added to their team salary. There would be no point in doing so, since there is no cap room for signing free agents."

lakers,3cbk3x,VladDracul_III,0,Mon Jul 6 17:20:15 2015 UTC,"The idea that Clarkson comes off the bench and Russell starts from day 1 is ridiculous. It's like Lakers fans are so unfamiliar with rookies that they don't understand you don't just throw them out there for 35+ min a night from day 1 unless you can't avoid it.  The starting lineup will probably be veteran heavy (includes Clarkson and Randle, yes it's weird) at the beginning of the season, and the rookies will be introduced off the bench, slowly gaining more minutes as the season goes on, eventually taking on the starter's share (35+ min) by mid season.  The only exception to this would be 1) you've got nobody else good to play the position, or 2) the player is a transcendental talent.   So of course Clarkson starts next season. And likely Russell will either come off the bench or perhaps start (4 da hype) but play limited minutes initially while he gets his feet wet.  We won't know anything about the permanent starting lineup until perhaps as late as the all star break."
lakers,3cbk3x,amarstan,9,Mon Jul 6 19:03:36 2015 UTC,They are going to play the best player at the position regardless of how many years they have put in. If Russell outplays Clarkson and they feel he is the better player he'll start.

lakers,3cbk3x,justflop,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:57:01 2015 UTC,What about RP? Last year was a tanking season so they weren't gonna put the best guys on the floor to win games.

lakers,3cbk3x,muffhug,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:54:33 2015 UTC,I don't disagree with that notion - the development of JC.   The OP's comment was based on the notion that veterans get heavy minutes unless 1) Nobody else to play or 2) The player is a transcendental talent.   My argument is that neither of those conditions were filled last year in starting Ronnie Price during some games.   Don't you see the inherent contradiction in what you said? I'm not talking about JC. I'm talking about giving Ronnie Price heavy minutes in the early part of the season over JLin.
lakers,3cbk3x,justflop,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"Oh, now I understand what you meant. I thought you were trying to say RP was the best of the 3 for some reason. But Lin was always getting more minutes than RP"

I think he's worthy of a starting spot next to Clarkson, especially if we don't make moves and get a good wing player to start. To me, the starters might look something like Russell, Clarkson, Kobe, Randle, Hibbert. We'll see though, I could be completely wrong and we could go for a more ""veteran"" lineup, although in my mind it would be detrimental, as we're trying to win games now.

lakers,3cbk3x,lmaonade200,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:18:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a Mavs fan, but I've been on the Clarkson bandwagon since summer league last season. Thought he had one of the better rookie seasons in the NBA. He might not be a long term point guard since you have Russell, but he was a good finisher and can make plays. Good piece for the future."
lakers,3cbk3x,ceelogreen5,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:07:28 2015 UTC,"Russell Clarkson Kobe Randle Hibbert   PG, SG, and SF are interchangeable for the most part. Kobe gets hidden on defense with the least mobile player of the three opposing players from 1-3. Not sure how this would work against monster SFs like LeBron or Durant, but there wasn't much chance that they weren't going to get their's, anyway (a true 3 and D SF would have REALLY helped, here...)  The offense should either be really good or a complete mess. Three shooting guards who can pass well, have good/great court vision, and can shoot well. It can be really dynamic with all three players sharing ball-handling duties if Byron does his thing coaching-wise. Randle and Hibbert may get in each other's way in the paint, though.  It's going to be...interesting. I just can't wait for the season to start. I don't care how much of a mess it may be. It's going to be fun."
lakers,3cbk3x,arch_wizard,2,Tue Jul 7 04:36:47 2015 UTC,"This may be a bit of a stretch, but I think they might develop Nance in that way (3&D player), he has a similar build to Trevor Ariza and is known for good defense, and though he has a shaky shot that can always be developed (it's not like he doesn't have an outside shot, he shoots above 30% from the 3, not good but at least the shot is there, I remember Ariza not having much of a 3 shot when he first joined the Lakers as well)  Even though Nance is technically a PF most of the dangerous players are at SF so we'd have him guard them anyways, being a defensive minded player and all"
lakers,3cbk3x,_Wi11,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:02:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah Ariza randomly found a stroke in the 2009 finals if I remember correctly. Pretty wild.   And I hope so, man. Perfect height for an SF. I know he's a hustle guy, but is he quick enough to keep up with the better SFs in the league? I have no idea about this dude's game other than that he was a great defender in college (defending mostly other PFs I'm assuming)."
lakers,3cbk3x,Darkcooo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"Your guess is as good as mine, my friend.  I've only seen the scouting reports and some of the ""highlight"" scout vids for Nance so I can't say much on how he regularly performs. But I'm betting on Nance being similar to Ariza and SFs more than traditional PFs.  He has a similar build (more lean than big like Randle) to Ariza. Ariza gave us some great hustle plays and overall effort and judging by how Nance talks about his game and how his scout reports went, he'll do the same as well.  A big part of his report was his speed and athleticism, apparently he's decently quick for a PF and can play above the rim, so he can swing between forward positions depending on how small the Lakers want to play. Another thing is his 7 foot 2 wingspan, he has the long arms so if he works on defensive awareness and lateral quickness I can see him becoming a good perimeter defender in the same vein as Ariza, Artest, Iguodala, etc.  It seems like he knows how to defend the pick n roll and down in the post as well (from defending PFs of course), so that's another plus. Though I'm pretty sure his defensive game is fairly complete, I think 4 years in college and overcoming a torn ACL definitely molded some true skill/technique out so he doesn't rely solely on natural talent. We'll just have to see whether or not he's able to scale his skills to the NBA level."
lakers,3cbk3x,BABYPUBESS,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:33:05 2015 UTC,I've been thinking this too. He resembles Draymond Green in a lot of ways.
lakers,3cbk3x,rtrainer30,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:49:28 2015 UTC,The way he take it to the hole scares me. Remind me of how reckless D.Rose played pre-injuries. He needs to be more cautious imo. Tons of upside though. Probably my favorite young player on the team other than Russell.

Now they have Lou, Nick, Kobe, and 2 young scoring guards......there's no DEFENSE between those 5 players and only ONE ball. They should've just tried to collect bad contracts and picks while signing good future prospects like KJ McDaniels instead of Lou....for 3 years holy shit......Now there's talk of Bass? This front office is killing the Lakers. I'm a fan of the Lakers, not this shitty front office. True fans don't get those 2 mixed up."
lakers,3ccczg,m-teezzy,5,Tue Jul 7 02:06:33 2015 UTC,"I must disagree with you on your points except for the defense on the guards. 1 thing hibbert and bass will do is play some good defense and negate some bad decisions on the young guys. Kobe defense will not be great either but i would rather have him guarding sf's instead of running around trying to guard these quick pg's and sg's. Sorry man but KJ was never coming as Houston would've matched. Sweet Lou will provide some good offense from the bench which we will need. The offseason isn't over yet maybe Indy gives us something in the Hibbert deal, maybe Dallas gifts us Anderson for Lin, maybe there's another deal coming. Mitch may not be great attracting free agents but the man can find talent through trades. As long as Mitch is in the front office i'm definitely a fan."

Nance sounded like he went to a military academy or something the way he was speaking. Brown seems like he's really motivated. All in all I think this is a really well disciplined group of rookies. I know it's extremely optimistic but if they could turn into our versions of CP3, Kawhi, and Danny Green in a few years that'd be great."

lakers,3ciloh,FreshDiamond,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:05:28 2015 UTC,He isn't going to become a good defender over night nor is his free throw shooting going to stop sucking. What we do know is what he does well he does very well. Just because jah okafor was the most NBA ready doesn't mean he is done improving. I agree these threads about okafor are pointless but so is critiquing his summer league performance by saying he struggled in areas he was expected to struggle in.
lakers,3ciloh,BeefCat10,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:43:20 2015 UTC,"The point is that people are worried because he has looked am good in the aspects we know he excels in. We don't need posts every time he scores 20 points. He's the most NBA ready prospect, but the Lakers didn't draft for this year. I'm not critiquing his SL play, but rather pointing out that if you want to be scared about how good he looks, you clearly haven't been watching all the negative aspects about his game that are very obvious. I wish the guy all the best, but we really should stop talking about him."

lakers,3ceucc,heroicdumb,3,Tue Jul 7 10:43:39 2015 UTC,"If you put him at the tree you are taking away everything that makes him special. I don't think he can stay in front of opposing threes and while he is a good mid range shooter, he won't be able to  stretch the floor like a three point shooter would be able too at that position. In the princeton the 3's and 4's do get swapped and do a lot of the same things, but I think it would be better for Randle to stay at the 4 and develop there."
lakers,3ceucc,Daucremann,3,Tue Jul 7 17:51:05 2015 UTC,"That's actually the one part of his game you shouldn't be too worried about. He's a pretty damn good ball-handler for his size. Many have referred to him as a point-forward because he excels at taking it coast-to-coast. The thing I worry about is him not being able to keep up with other SF's, especially teams who can play a 2/3 at the 3 (like Wiggins in Minnesota.) I'm not sure that he'll have the physical quickness on defense to keep up with them.   But I do think Byron is giving him a shot at SF every now and then. (He fucking ran Ryan Kelly, Ed Davis & Carlos Boozer at SF at random times this season, Kelly for the most time.) which is fine. We might as well see what he can do before we lock him down in our roster as a ""one-dimensional"" player.   God damn I'm so excited for Ju."
lakers,3ceucc,badguymatt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:51:32 2015 UTC,"If teams like Golden State are running small, Randle at 3 would give us a great advantage offensively. I think the forward positions are starting to get blurred anyway. I'm just worried about who Randle can guard 1 v 1."
lakers,3ceucc,_Wi11,2,Tue Jul 7 14:26:42 2015 UTC,"The thing about forwards is true, Randle even mentioned that about his game to the media saying, 'the system coach runs - the 3's and 4's do the same types of things' or something."
lakers,3ceucc,lakers__sad_summer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:21:26 2015 UTC,"That's different, the Warriors can do that since everybody in their small ball lineup is a big threat from 3. Draymond was also borderline DPOY so that's a huge difference."
lakers,3ceucc,TuneHD,3,Tue Jul 7 16:49:27 2015 UTC,I think Randle slimming down is a mistake.  I think he should get bigger and try to be more of a Karl Malone type where he bullies opposing 4s.  Bully ball has basically been his shtick forever.  Having him get lighter is taking away one of the main assets that got him drafted at # 7.
lakers,3ceucc,StealthRUs,5,Tue Jul 7 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but he is slimming down fat. Fat works when you're in college when you are playing smaller players, but when your in the NBA the size of the average player goes up so the size advantage isn't as overwhelming. Especially if a lot of your size is fat. I think he is going to get as big again as he was, it's just more of it will be muscle. Slimming down has to be improving his speed, which is good for the stretch 4 system the NBA is going to. Also it's been said that he is trying to improve his shoot to become serviceable in games. Slimming down should also make him have better stamina in games, considering a big knock on his game was stamina issues. I think Randle is just trying to improve all aspects of his game and I am all for it."
lakers,3ceucc,PaperDesk,2,Tue Jul 7 16:16:10 2015 UTC,"If it's just slimming down fat, then I'm all for that.  I thought he was pretty ripped, though, so I figured he wouldn't have enough fat to slim down like 15 pounds.  But if he's just leaning out before he starts bulking again, I got no qualms with that."
lakers,3ceucc,StealthRUs,2,Tue Jul 7 16:27:04 2015 UTC,"I agree, unless he plans on playing the SF I just don't see why he wants to slim down. Trimming fat is great, but I want to see some serious muscle put on him as well. He doesn't have the length to afford being slim at PF like guys like Duncan and Dirk. Guys like Griffin can get away with being smaller (mostly wingspan) is because he's an athletic freak and big muscle wise."
lakers,3ceucc,TuneHD,-1,Tue Jul 7 16:46:53 2015 UTC,"Edit: what is everyone's vendetta towards you, man? The logic is so much better over in /r/NBA which is sad.   Bro everyone just likes to downvote you for no reason. You're not wrong. That's literally 100% all his game has been since high school.  Some scouts thought his game wouldn't translate to the NBA because he wouldn't be big enough to continue to play bully ball.   I can't blame him for tryina get smaller if he didn't believe he was capable of the play style he had coming into the NBA. But it woulda been nice to at least see first."
lakers,3ceucc,badguymatt,2,Tue Jul 7 14:28:51 2015 UTC,I totally agree but I think they had health concerns. I'm guessing they didn't think his frame could hold that weight and still be competitive.  They noticed he was sluggish last year at training camp.
lakers,3ceucc,readem_n_weep,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:30:46 2015 UTC,"That's also true. He didn't quite look as explosive as we had hoped.   But man, you bring up one flaw on one of your best players (who's fucking 19 and has PLENTY of time to develop) and /r/Lakers just goes bananas. I'm glad, for that reason, we didn't draft Okafor."
lakers,3ceucc,badguymatt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:44:13 2015 UTC,"You guys really neglect the fact JR had a great midrange game before his injury. If he could play with it off the ball and catch and shoot, than he already can iso, he would be the go to target (after Kobe).  idk exactly what y'all mean by 'bully ball' exactly, but JR will still post up, still drive (even better now), and still use his strength to get up and finish through contact."
lakers,3ceucc,lakers__sad_summer,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:47:41 2015 UTC,"I never once said he didn't have a good midrange game. Cause he does. And that's actually exactly what both Stealth and I are talking about. Randle is moving away from the bully ball, and headed more towards ISO and midrange. He'll be able to out-muscle SF's in the NBA, sure. But that's always been the biggest aspect of his game. In college and high school, he was always like the 2nd biggest guy on the court. There's a drastic difference between that and the NBA. I've got great confidence in his offensive ability as a SF. It's his defensive quickness that worries me.   He will still drive, and he'll still be Julius. All we're really discussing right now is whether he'll be able to defend at the 3, and how him shedding weight will effect his use of out-muscling guys.   I still think we drafted the right guy last year if that means anything to ya. I'm so fucking stoked to have him healthy this year."
lakers,3ceucc,badguymatt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:20:35 2015 UTC,"They don't like that I tell them like it is.  Some of them are kids who don't remember anything before the Kobe-Gasol Lakers and just assume that the Lakers just won every NBA title (not won by Jordan or Duncan) from Showtime all the way through 2010.    They think we always win, and they don't want to hear it when I tell them that we have to tank and rebuild and be terrible for a little while for us to be good again.  They don't remember the Sedale Threatt/Cedric Ceballos years and just assume that everyone wants to play for the Lakers all the time.     I don't think even the Celtics fans are as delusional as the fans are on here.  So they get pissed at me when I tell them that getting Robin Lopez, Rajon Rondo, Brandon Jennings, or Demarre Carroll isn't going to lead  to us winning a title or signing Kevin Durant or Westbrook.   Or that building a 35-win team isn't going to make Lebron leave Cleveland and come here."
lakers,3ceucc,StealthRUs,0,Tue Jul 7 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"Just off the top of my head, the only player with his size that's able to dribble the ball with speed like him is Lebron.   I hope he does take pride in his one-on-one defense. We could really use him against the bigger 3's like Lebron, Melo, and Durant."
lakers,3ceucc,justbringitbitch,2,Tue Jul 7 11:25:57 2015 UTC,"Don't forget guys like Blake Griffin, he has underrated handles. pretty sure what I've heard is he was a PG throughout high school then had a massive growth spurt so he ended up as PF."

lakers,3ceucc,StealthRUs,2,Tue Jul 7 14:09:35 2015 UTC,"Melo and, if the Finals were any indication, Lebron post up alot. I would like to think they'd have a harder time posting Randle up than the defenders they usually face."

Randle is a big, maybe he's more complete than the other two but it's real hard to see him getting a signature shoe deal given the history of bigs and shoe deals.  Russell I think is the most likely to get it if any of them do, and I imagine it'll be Nike just with the Kobe connection but he'd basically have to live up to every piece of hype around him to get there."

lakers,3cbyg6,babajafar,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"I think there is a big difference in Lillard and Russell. Lillard showed he can get separation from his defender while I question that Russell will be able to do the same in the NBA. He just doesnt have the quickness to do so. If you look at his games from college he needed a screen to get space and took a lot of contested shots because he couldnt break away and those were college level athletes. Russell is not a big time athlete or finisher so I dont see him taking it to the rim that often. What does that leave you with? Scoring off the ball: Spot up shots, catch and shoots while coming off screens and maybe a few jumpers off the dribble after a few moves. Does that translate to 17 ppg?"
lakers,3cbyg6,TuneHD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:17:11 2015 UTC,I'm not saying Russell is the same player as Lillard. I'm saying that's it's possible for a rookie playing big minutes to average 17ppg.

lakers,3c8s0u,evsoul,4,Mon Jul 6 03:03:35 2015 UTC,"I was almost going to add the Wolves to the list but I thought people would be flooding my inbox calling me crazy. The Wolves have some great players and are constantly wrecked by injuries, if they have a healthy season then they can possibly upset us."
lakers,3c8s0u,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,5,Mon Jul 6 03:12:15 2015 UTC,"We root for a team with a lot of stupid fans. Now that we suck, you're gonna inevitably get down voted for speaking the truth. I've been an obsessed Lakers fan since Kobe was backing up Eddie Jones, and it's always been this way."
lakers,3c8s0u,SedaleThreatt,3,Mon Jul 6 06:02:52 2015 UTC,"I think it's really that there are just A LOT of Lakers fans.  There are a lot of very informed, reasonable Lakers fans as well.  In fact name a category of fan and they are in the Lakers fan-BASE and in large numbers.    Also, there could be kids posting as well.  That's why I try to be polite.  I don't want to crap all over a 13 year-old's optimism.  And I'm not saying anyone in this thread in particular is a kid so settle down.  The West is crazy.  There are the contenders (SAS, GSW), the major rager playoff teams (HOU, MEM, OKC), the more than likely playoff teams (DAL, LAC), and then every other team (except maybe POR) is in the Lakers boat where it is just a big question mark with reasons to be optimistic (especially NO).   Basically 1/2 the west can say ""we're making the playoffs!"" and the other 1/2 can say ""we might grab the 8 spot!"".  Sedale was beast BTW.  Loved that era -> NVE/Eddie Jones ->Kobe/Shaq"
lakers,3c8s0u,sharkytowers76,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:57:52 2015 UTC,I feel like every year is the Wolves year to potentially breakout and they never do. This is probably their strongest year to do so but then again so is every year.
lakers,3c8s0u,SirDigbyChckenCeasar,-1,Mon Jul 6 17:23:14 2015 UTC,You're crazy

Dallas doesnt have a full squad capable of making the playoffs in the WC.  The suns and jazz will have a fun fight for the final spot all year. Dallas is better than us, were prob competing with Portland & the T-Wolves for that 10 spot"

Dirk is only getting older and the better your PG is the better DJ is.  Monta was a pivotal part of the mavs offense and he got replaced by a spot up shooter whos coming off a torn achilles.  They lost monta and replaced chandler with a younger version of himself.  The kings will find a way to fuck things up, that place is a tire fire managerially, but if the gods answer their prayers they could compete with the mavs for the 9th spot"
lakers,3c8s0u,LoraXis,-1,Mon Jul 6 07:04:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the Clippers are as good as they're going to be, with Jordan leaving and only a few extra million for a player. NO has Davis who is extraordinary, but the rest of their roster is questionable."

lakers,3c8s0u,readem_n_weep,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:56:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not, I just don't expect him to get much play time under Byron with the recent acquisitions that we've made."
lakers,3c8s0u,Cheese234,2,Mon Jul 6 04:01:57 2015 UTC,:/ I hope his play demands it but yeah I hear you. Scott plays his veterans and makes rookies earn it.

lakers,3c8s0u,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,2,Mon Jul 6 04:03:52 2015 UTC,"Not career highlights, but game by game highlights on youtube. I'm just saying I see potential."

lakers,3c8s0u,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,2,Mon Jul 6 04:16:24 2015 UTC,"Haha no, not at all. I was actually thinking it might be seen that way when I commented. I just think Anthony Brown and him could be very impressive. I think Brown was overlooked a lot because of his team, and can be a starting SF."
lakers,3c8s0u,evsoul,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:19:30 2015 UTC,"The first thought I had when looking at footage of Nance playing was how athletic and explosive he seemed. Like he may have been drafted partially as a Blake Griffin defense system?  Just a blind supposition on my part, but I wonder if we'll see the two match up at any point in the next few years.  Or is he too small?"
lakers,3c8s0u,sharkytowers76,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:05:14 2015 UTC,I heard sacre might go to indiana

lakers,3c8s0u,rl3191,-2,Mon Jul 6 00:15:38 2015 UTC,"No. They are just filling bench spots. Apparently, most people on here have forgotten a roster needs over a dozen players and preferably around 16-18. The lakers were bare bones a week or so ago. Now the 1-2 should be set for depth and now the 3-4 is just about there. The 5 spot is probably good enough at this point as well."

lakers,3c8s0u,mexicanborderlands,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:03:04 2015 UTC,These signings are bench depth. It has nothing to do with that.

lakers,3c8s0u,jaypooner,15,Sun Jul 5 23:42:22 2015 UTC,pretty consistent offensively. Great mid range. Defense leaves a lot to be desired but a huge imrpovement over boozer lol

lakers,3c8s0u,readem_n_weep,2,Mon Jul 6 03:58:42 2015 UTC,What she lacks in height she makes up with veteran savvy.  Very cerebral player.  Sees the court (with bifocals) like no other.  A clubhouse favorite -  cooks a mean lasagna.
lakers,3c8s0u,sharkytowers76,2,Mon Jul 6 08:08:52 2015 UTC,This can't be stated enough that your dead grandma just lying on the court has better defense than boozer.
lakers,3c8s0u,how_u_like_meow,2,Mon Jul 6 05:55:30 2015 UTC,"Defense leaves a lot to be desired   Brandon Bass has actually turned into a fairly solid defender. I think when he is paired alongside Hibbert we will have some great interior defense, especially compared to what we've seen the past couple seasons."
lakers,3c8s0u,BABYPUBESS,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:43:11 2015 UTC,"He is a good defender. Couple of years ago he was defending lebron in the playoffs. Granted, he didn't fare too well, but the fact that he was chosen to speaks about the confidence in his defensive impact. He is also a good guy to have in the locker room."
lakers,3c8s0u,mahg94,2,Mon Jul 6 02:27:25 2015 UTC,He'll of a free throw shooter. Solid offensive game. Not too sure how he is on defense

lakers,3c8s0u,SSD65,2,Mon Jul 6 17:06:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure but they wouldn't make Randle give his number up, Bass would likely change."
lakers,3c8s0u,readem_n_weep,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:38:50 2015 UTC,"Hibbert. 4. Bass. 3. Brown. 2. Kobe. 1. Russell.    Then we can have a bench of Randle, Clarkson and Williams and our other pieces. This doesn't look bad and most importantly... This builds a foundation and brings players to our team. Even if we trade some of these pieces, they are great pieces teams should want. (I don't necessarily want brown as a starter, but unless we can get another quality SF like Snell, ala S&T with Chicago maybe?)"
lakers,3c8s0u,Musingmike,2,Mon Jul 6 01:15:26 2015 UTC,How about Kobe at 3 and Clarkson at 2?
lakers,3c8s0u,Tw1987,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"Kobe plays the 2 and the 3 at this stage in his career. It just depends on matchups. Clarkson will likely be the 2 guy when Kobe is at the 3. However, that obviously won't be the case when Kobe is playing the 2."

lakers,3ce1f8,Flagcap,19,Tue Jul 7 04:35:15 2015 UTC,"That's not why you, or anybody, should be watching Jahlil. There's no good that can come from it. Either he does really well and some people are sad, or he struggles and everyone rejoices. Neither of those make any sense, and frankly, they are both kind of unfair. We got the guy we wanted in the draft, but Jahlil was more than qualified to be drafted at #2. I'm excited to see him develop in the league, and I think others should too."
lakers,3ce1f8,Buckelroo,3,Tue Jul 7 04:40:15 2015 UTC,"Great points, and yeah I was just so torn 50/50 between the two that I developed a lot of anxiety about wanting to get the better future player of the two which I see is pointless. Thanks for the insight."
lakers,3ce1f8,BeefCat10,14,Tue Jul 7 04:54:23 2015 UTC,Adam Morrison averaged 25 points a game in summer league. That should tell you enough about how much summer league matters.

lakers,3ce1f8,VladDracul_III,3,Tue Jul 7 06:21:36 2015 UTC,Why are sixers fans mad about Russell? Is it because they were expecting to get him? They got a great big to replace their flop in embiid.
lakers,3ce1f8,Schneeky,3,Tue Jul 7 06:38:56 2015 UTC,"Every Sixers fan wanted Russell and it makes sense considering they had Noels/Embiid with no legitimate PG since they traded MCW.   When reports started coming out that the Lakers might get Russell, a lot of sixers fans started to panic and dismissed the report as ""smokescreen"".. but then we shocked everyone when we drafted Russell and a lot of Sixers fans have been salty ever since."
lakers,3ce1f8,BionicSix,4,Tue Jul 7 06:02:13 2015 UTC,It's one meaningless game - no great player is remembered by their first summer league outing.
lakers,3ce1f8,Schneeky,3,Tue Jul 7 06:09:48 2015 UTC,All I saw was 1 SUMMER LEAGUE game and him missing all his free throws. I am not sure what should we regret...
lakers,3ce1f8,Tizzleman,7,Tue Jul 7 04:39:53 2015 UTC,I dont think anything Okafor does will affect our views on the draft. He played how everyone expected to play. He'll probably put up those numbers in the regular season too. We drafted Russell on the chance that he'll be a superstar. Only he can determine if we regret passing on Okafor or not.
lakers,3ce1f8,lakers__sad_summer,3,Tue Jul 7 05:19:37 2015 UTC,"D'angelo Russell, Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle, and Robert Upshaw (pending) are why I went from ""SHIT, WHY PASS ON OKAFOR!"" to seeing how awesome the team looks post-draft. The FO really did well in drafting talented needed in key positions and getting high caliber talent at that. Okafor is officially an afterthought bc of ALL that COMBINED.  Spacing and being able to push the ball up the court with DR/JC/JR is awesome and RU erases mistakes for JR (which he tend to do). All are great rebounders too, so that leads to free fastbreak points -- a solid trait to have for a young team that (maybe) prone to ""not getting"" the complexity of the NBA game. Also, those are two big guards who at least have hops and wingspan to add a little more defense. Solid four.  Overall, I'd say I don't see the HOF potential in DR like I do in JO. I'll give him that. But, and I know it's impossible to project such things, I feel like the young players Lakers got hedge their bets closer to championship contention in their prime over any other young core."

KAT's going to have growing pains, and Russell isn't going to be the focal point of LA's offense, hell he might not even start the season out as a starter because of how many good guards we have.  Jah is hyper polished and its likely his stat line from college is close to his stat line in the NBA, hell it might even improve. That said, Jah has less potential than KAT or Russell, maybe less than a few other players as well (Herzonja, Porzingus, Mudiay). This year isn't what will end up mattering for any of these players, they are mostly all long term prospects on teams that don't expect them to carry the load this year."

lakers,3c8rn7,Wateriswet1212,18,Sun Jul 5 23:35:43 2015 UTC,Bass can play defense on the perimeter if need be. In the 2013 playoffs he did amazingly against Melo both in the post and away from the paint.
lakers,3c8rn7,mister_greyMATTER,18,Sun Jul 5 23:45:19 2015 UTC,"He can switch, but he's no small forward."

I like both signings, but both were more of acquiring assets/veteran presence as opposed to addressing team needs - which is of course to find a perimeter defender at the SF.   We don't even need a 3 and D guy - just a D guy will suffice."

lakers,3c8rn7,willbsn13,2,Mon Jul 6 01:46:07 2015 UTC,A small forward or 3
lakers,3c8rn7,Reply_Hazy,18,Mon Jul 6 01:11:01 2015 UTC,"Solid post-defender with a decent mid-range, can play 4/5 behind Hibbert/Randle. Good signing, Lakers have had a quietly good off-season. Looks like Hill/Boozer probably won't be coming back or Sacre/Kelly/Young are outgoing in the Roy Hibbert deal."
lakers,3c8rn7,Cienes,10,Sun Jul 5 23:36:06 2015 UTC,To add... He's as professional as it gets in the pros. Kobe will love him.
lakers,3c8rn7,Schneeky,5,Sun Jul 5 23:45:17 2015 UTC,"I don't want to see him pulling minutes away from Randle's development, however."
lakers,3c8rn7,lebbe,8,Sun Jul 5 23:46:03 2015 UTC,I think Byron might make Bass the starter considering he's the vet but who knows
lakers,3c8rn7,bul1dog,-9,Sun Jul 5 23:48:14 2015 UTC,Yeah Bass should be the starter. He can actually hit a jumper and is a better defender than Randle.  And Randle and Hibbert together simply doesn't work. Neither can hit a jumper to save their lives. The spacing would be atrocious.
lakers,3c8rn7,Gardeon,20,Mon Jul 6 00:22:13 2015 UTC,Do you even...have you watched Randle play at all??  All his SL and pre-season highlights are him shooting mid-range or slashing left from the top of the key. Randle and Hibbert can absolutely play together.
lakers,3c8rn7,willbsn13,4,Mon Jul 6 00:37:49 2015 UTC,I'm on board with this though. Totally happy to see Randle be eased back into the NBA grind and learn the ropes off a vet like Bass and Hibbert.
lakers,3c8rn7,Cienes,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:39:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I see him has playing 22-28 minutes a night between the 4/5, spelling mainly Randle but also Hibbert when needed. Then the 4th big (Tarik Black) plays the remaining minutes w/ Sacre/Kelly as towel wavers/injury insurance"
lakers,3c8rn7,khighyle,5,Sun Jul 5 23:51:11 2015 UTC,I'm leaning toward Sacre/Kelly outgoing via trade.
lakers,3c8rn7,TuneHD,2,Mon Jul 6 00:02:37 2015 UTC,We need to send sacre out to get tarik more playing time
lakers,3c8rn7,willbsn13,3,Mon Jul 6 00:28:44 2015 UTC,What about Tarik Black?
lakers,3c8rn7,WOX_69,2,Mon Jul 6 00:58:43 2015 UTC,By 4th big I meant Tarik
lakers,3c8rn7,macgroobs,20,Mon Jul 6 01:01:57 2015 UTC,"Was just about to post this. Dude's got an interesting looking jumper but he's all effort, which Scott will appreciate. As long as it's nothing too much and not too long, I'm fine. Would love it even more if a team option is attached to it in some fashion."
lakers,3c8rn7,WOX_69,19,Sun Jul 5 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"It may not look good, but his mid-range jumper is very reliable. As a Celts fan, it sucks to see this guy go."
lakers,3c8rn7,diondrems,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:46:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's oddly reliable. I remember when the Magic signed him after their loss to us in 2009 and figured he'd help put them over the edge.  Turns out he didn't play a lot in Orlando, which I thought was very odd."
lakers,3c8rn7,WOX_69,14,Sun Jul 5 23:48:59 2015 UTC,"It's funny how people were crying literally 2 days ago because the Lakers hadn't signed anyone 3 days after the start of free agency. I swear the emotions in here,"
lakers,3c8rn7,superbadsoul,11,Sun Jul 5 23:59:53 2015 UTC,"Don't you know? No one wants to play with Kobe even for a season, the Laker's FO is terrible, we have terrible owners, we're outdated and we have a state tax. No one wants to join the Lakers anymore, might as well contract."
lakers,3c8rn7,WOX_69,2,Mon Jul 6 00:08:34 2015 UTC,You forgot about our lack of metrics and how well-connected small market teams are these days.

lakers,3c8rn7,kabob23,2,Mon Jul 6 06:27:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, and they don't want to risk the backlash of failure in a large market city, either. There are literally no benefits to playing for the Lakers."
lakers,3c8rn7,WOX_69,3,Mon Jul 6 06:40:24 2015 UTC,"Celtics fan here, you guys are going to absolutely love Brandon Bass. He's a hard working player, constant professional, and he does all of the little things out there on the court. He's pretty solid on the defensive end as well. He's not going to blow you out of the water but he's a solid complimentary player."
lakers,3c8rn7,itsyourdestini,0,Mon Jul 6 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"And for franchises like both of ours, that's all I can ever ask for."
lakers,3c8rn7,ZOOTV83,6,Mon Jul 6 02:40:32 2015 UTC,I like this. I mean we are playing for Wins. Make 76 draft high as possible.
lakers,3c8rn7,numbnutsnz,4,Mon Jul 6 00:16:42 2015 UTC,"Celtics fan here.  You guys will love Bass.  He's such a tremendous worker and can do all the nitty gritty on offense and defense.  His stats definitely aren't flashy, but he will absolutely hep you guys.  Treat him well."
lakers,3c8rn7,mister_greyMATTER,11,Mon Jul 6 01:04:45 2015 UTC,So many people stressing about Bass taking minutes away from Randle. You thought he was getting ready to play 48?  What if he's shit? Need a tried and tested vet in there. Good move FO.
lakers,3c8rn7,blackbeardboyband,2,Mon Jul 6 00:07:09 2015 UTC,"While I agree that it is a good pickup, I wouldn't want Bass to start. Lakers need to develop their young talent. You don't take minutes away from a lottery pick if you don't even know how he's going to perform. We can't assume Randle is going to be shit or if he's going to be good if we do t play him meaningful minutes.    To me, this pickup, along with Lou Will and Hibbert, seems like a move to be somewhat competitive. What Scott needs to do, is find a balance of getting the young guys PT while staying competitive with the vets. Scott has a better team than he had last year. The FO made moves, it's Scott's turn to put it all together."
lakers,3c8rn7,supermaor23,6,Mon Jul 6 00:27:31 2015 UTC,Good pickup. I like it.

lakers,3c8rn7,Gardeon,5,Mon Jul 6 00:18:08 2015 UTC,Trade packages of Nick Young + one of these Big Men will probably go down to create cap.
lakers,3c8rn7,mes8007,7,Mon Jul 6 00:21:24 2015 UTC,God I hope it's Kelly
lakers,3c8rn7,TimeisIllmatic95,4,Mon Jul 6 00:45:11 2015 UTC,"Best players will play. Can't keep babysitting Randle. If he's a monster, he'll get the mins. If Brandon Bass beats u out for mins, clearly u aren't all-star material like we hoped. And that's not a knock on Bass, I know he's solid but he shouldnt be beating out a guy who was once considered a top 4 pick up until a couple weeks before the draft.  And Nance and Upshaw are projects. They wont be breaking the regular rotation before Jan/Feb more than likely. As they'll have to learn a lot about playing down low in the NBA as while as build their endurance defensively. And Kelly is gonna be traded or dropped."
lakers,3c8rn7,LowkeyAnushole,5,Mon Jul 6 02:10:35 2015 UTC,Kelly and Sacre won't get any burn. I think Nance will get mins at the 3 more.
lakers,3c8rn7,TimeisIllmatic95,4,Mon Jul 6 00:42:49 2015 UTC,"Which I understand, but that's still 8 spots used on the front court.  That seems unbalanced especially when only black hibbert and maybe upshaw cover weak spots."

lakers,3c8rn7,Schneeky,3,Sun Jul 5 23:51:59 2015 UTC,Great veteran signing to go with Hibbert and Lou Williams. Add Kobe to that that and you have a nice mix of vets and young prospects. Its looking up for this season and still they've kept their flexibility for next season.

If the rookies produce well enough, and Kobe stays healthy the team will play much better.  It will be interesting to see What Byron does with the team though. Is he gonna be deadset in old school basketball, or is he gonna embrace some of the new. if its the former, then its not gonna go well"

I get that Clarkson is a good player, and he wanted to give him time to develop as a player, but why not stick him in at the 2 for a bit and slide out Lin later?  Not to mention, the chemistry between Lin and Davis seemed to pull points out of nowhere at times, but eventually Scott separated them near the end of the season so we could tank better."

We had so many injury issues with Julius being out for most of the year, Kobe being out for half of it, a tank job, a stronger western conference (compared to what we'll have next year).. and that's not even taking into account all the good pieces we've added this year.  I am calling a somewhere between 35-40 wins."

Building confidence in your youth is a huge part of player development. Building a garbage team around them certainly doesn't help them become better players. You think Randle and Russell would feel good about playing for a team that has so little faith in you that they're forcing you to tank?  The fuck you gonna do if you happen to whiff the lotto? You'd be the laughing stock of the entire league. The Lakers are not the fucking Cleveland Cavaliers. They don't need years of being ran like shit, praying to David Stern to be rewarded with top lotto picks, just to land the big fish. Fuck that.  Might as well get some smart contracts on board, get your young guys playing to win and go fishing for the big fish when Kobe's contract comes off the books.

They don't have the room to sign him straight up for what he wants so he'd have to be acquired through a trade where they're giving up or exchanging salary in the process.

We still need a star player, like Durant, and I think these signings and good progress this season will go a LONG way (and Kobe taking a back seat).   Unless you have a coach like Pop, you're gonna need 2 all stars. Even then Pop has shown he could take down 3 headed monsters in this league, even when one of the heads is the best basketball player on the planet. I think Mitch made the best out of a bad situation. The only player Lakers were supposed to be serious contenders for was LMA, and they missed. All that fluff on missing out on DJ/Love is just a distraction. Media kicking Lakers while they are down.  I hope to see a .500 season with good development from the core. I'm thinking .400 is more realistic though. We'll see, but I feel like things are looking better at least. Maybe we can sign on Mark Jackson or Van Gundy too. I think we need an upgrade at coach too."

lakers,3c9gap,Fruggles,2,Mon Jul 6 12:58:05 2015 UTC,"It is true.  Add Nick Young to that list, also.  Everyone was ecstatic about signing him last year, and now that he got his last big contract and reverted to form, everyone here can't wait to get rid of him."

lakers,3c9gap,toptier,2,Mon Jul 6 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"If the Lakers let Kobe go to free agency 2 years ago, he would've been lucky to get $15 million coming off that Achilles injury."

lakers,3c9gap,StealthRUs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:44:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry buddy but Plashke/LA Times, Charles Barkley, Adande and Brian Windhorst/ESPN have already said we were a dead franchise and we need to fire everyone and move back to Minnesota. There's no saving us even if Mitch did pull off some great moves it doesn't matter cause LMA, DJ, Monroe all turned us down. If only Mitch pulled these moves off a few days ago then we might've been ok."
lakers,3c9gap,nluna1975,2,Mon Jul 6 18:48:12 2015 UTC,"Did Charles Barkley say we were dead? He was just saying we were having a pretty shitty free agency period, which at the time we were?"

lakers,3c9gap,NicDwolfwood,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:16:35 2015 UTC,They do... People need to relax. This is why Lakers were pushing the trade for cousins. Then that's the guy you build your team around. Free agency would have looked at us serious. So that didn't happen we went after la and he said why come to a team that's in rebuilding when I am in my prime ... We got a decent roster that won't tank and will win some games. Maybe back to 30 35 wins...
lakers,3c9gap,FuriousFlex,0,Mon Jul 6 06:27:34 2015 UTC,it def saved face. I like the potential small ball lineup of Lou/Russell/Clarkson/Bass/Randle/; we'll see tho

lakers,3c9gap,teo1315,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:09:49 2015 UTC,Randle at the 5 would be interesting to see when we play the Warriors and they go small though
lakers,3c9gap,CalmerThanYouAreDood,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:13:25 2015 UTC,That lineup would be a disaster. You would 5 guys that are at best average defenders and at least 3 of them are poor.

lakers,3ccctt,MikeMcNorv,2,Mon Jul 6 20:45:39 2015 UTC,"Personally, if we somehow sign/trade for Tony Snell or Gerald Green I want the starting 5 to be 5 - Hibbert. 4 - Randle. 3 - Snell/Green. 2- Kobe. 1 - Russell. Then the bench can be 5 - Black 4 - Bass - 3 - Brown 2 - Williams 1- Clarkson. Then our third string would be 5- Upshaw 4 - Nance Jr 3 - Empty - 2 - Jabari Brown - 1 Empty -"

Regardless, should be a fun team to watch"
lakers,3ccctt,supermaor23,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:34:24 2015 UTC,"With the current roster, I think it is going to be: 5 - Hib Dog, 4 - Randle, 3 - Kobe, 2 - Clarkson, 1 - Russell. Russell is great at passing/running the court, so I think he's gonna be the PG over Clarkson. I wouldn't be surprised if they put Kobe at the 2, brought Clarkson off the bench, and brought in a 3. Maybe Anthony Brown will start a few games a few games."
lakers,3cccmr,Kermetheus,5,Mon Jul 6 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"I went to a few games at Staple Center last year. And having sat at both the mid-level and upper-level for those games, I would definitely prefer mid over upper. The upper-level isn't too bad, but after experiencing mid-level seats I don't think I'd go back to sitting up top. It will cost a bit extra, but the viewing experience is a lot more pleasant.  Edit: Here's a link to SeatGeek's Staple Center page with images of the floor from each section."
lakers,3cccmr,dr3wd3zi,3,Mon Jul 6 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"Depends on your financial situation.  If you can find nosebleed at center court the seats aren't bad, you can definitely see the action better than you would think.  I used to find seats there for around $40.  Mid-level seats are substantially better but can cost around $100.  Hopefully ticket prices decrease a little considering the on court product isn't...elite.  Stubhub is your friend, check it out"
lakers,3cccmr,TeamFreaky,3,Mon Jul 6 20:35:52 2015 UTC,Don't go to the 300 section if you're scared of heights
lakers,3cccmr,swaggerqueen16,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:40:08 2015 UTC,"If you're going for the game experience, to hang out at Staples, then it's worth it. If you're trying to watch a game, catch it on TV or try to score some cheaper tickets the day of the game on stub hub or the ticket reseller flavor of the week."
lakers,3cd3ep,Cincybengals7,2,Mon Jul 6 23:45:05 2015 UTC,"We might not have anymore cap space remaining after trading for Roy Hibbert,  and signing Lou and Bass. Sacre and Kelly's contracts will be used to off set the trade kicker from Roy Hibbert, and then Young has to be moved just to make room for Lou. We are probably using our mini mle on Bass. So the only way we can get a 3, is through sign and trade with Lin or Hill."
lakers,3cd3ep,jaysteezy24,2,Mon Jul 6 23:52:00 2015 UTC,"We are going to sign Lou and then make Hibbert waive his trade kicker, something he can only do if we are at the cap.  It sucks for Hibbert to leave $2.3 mil on the table, but he doesn't have a choice if he wants to actually get some playing time in his contract year.  Eric Pincus detailed it here  Things might change if we do a sign & trade for Lin and take some salary back, but as of now we'll sign the rookies and Lou to get close enough to the cap that we won't have to pay hibbert's trade kicker and have it count against our cap, and then we'll look to dump kelly/swaggy/sacre and use that space on someone else or keep it to start the season"
lakers,3cd3ep,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:23:31 2015 UTC,Ahh okay.. So Sacre and Kelly won't need to be involved. But wouldn't it be beneficial for us to move Sacre and Kelly in this deal because we are looking to move them anyways?
lakers,3cd3ep,jaysteezy24,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:38:19 2015 UTC,"All that would do is free up the $2.3million to pay Hibbert's bonus.  We could do that to free up the roster spaces and pay minimum salary players, but if we can do it later and free that space up to sign someone else.  We don't really need to pay Hibbert $17mil instead of $15, it's not good for anyone except for Hibbert."
lakers,3cd3ep,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:43:24 2015 UTC,"Good point, I was just worried that the Lakers won't be able to find other suitors to take on Sacre and Kelly, that's why I thought we'd be killing 2 birds with 1 stone."
lakers,3cd3ep,jaysteezy24,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:49:25 2015 UTC,"So let's assume the Lakers renounce their Bird Rights on Lin (because they literally can't do any of these moves if they don't)  If the Hibbert trade is processed before the signings, the Lakers don't need to make room even including the trade kicker.  But if Indiana is paying that (which is standard practice)  it won't effect his cap number post-trade, which means the Lakers have room to do the rest of their deals.  The only question is Bass, they may end up needing part of the Room-MLE to fit him, depending on what he makes."
lakers,3cd3ep,C3PO1Fan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:13:18 2015 UTC,"Correct Indiana does pay the trade kicker, but that 2.3 million or so that Hibbert got from the trade kicker will count against our cap space meaning instead of the initial 15 million being counted against us, it will actually be around 17 million. We aren't paying him the 2.3 million, but on our books its going to look like it. That's why details of the trade has been fuzzy. Including Sacre and Kelly helps us shed 2.6 million off the cap. So essentially it means we cancel out the 2.3 million from Hibberts trade kick and we just absorb his normal contract."
lakers,3cd3ep,jaysteezy24,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:36:12 2015 UTC,"We don't have an MLE, we only have the room exception of $2.8mil to sign him unless we free up space with a trade. They will wait to do the hibbert trade until the last minute when they have used as much of the space as possible in as many ways as possible"
lakers,3cd3ep,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:38:06 2015 UTC,We won't know till the Hibbert trade comes through on Thursday. I think that dictates everything.
lakers,3cd3ep,AaronOG,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:12:17 2015 UTC,Depends on what Bass's contract is.  I got the Lakers at ~3 mil in space before Bass.  I don't understand the numbers the Yahoo Guys are tossing around.  Only explanation is they think the Lakers aren't renouncing Lin's bird rights but I'm not sure why the think that.
lakers,3c9zad,yatrickmith,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:54:11 2015 UTC,looked like a skinny mini kobe in those highlights. He's good at getting that and-1 jumper to go and his three looked wet good pick up for us to help with scoring off the bench.

lakers,3ceidv,FreshDiamond,7,Tue Jul 7 10:54:15 2015 UTC,"Defense was lazy.  He gets winded way too easy.  Free throws were very bad.  Doesn't go hard to the basket, got blocked a lot. Didn't look like he could bully his defender down low as much, stepped OB on the last play of the game.  He didn't really have a great game, certainly not good enough to warrant a post like this, unless you just watched his highlights and nothing else."
lakers,3ceidv,Loryk,2,Tue Jul 7 13:32:10 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I really believe that he can be the best player in the draft but he has a lot to overcome. This description of his play doesn't come as a surprise to me in the least.
lakers,3ceidv,FreshDiamond,3,Tue Jul 7 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"Okafor and Russell are both amazing prospects - Okafor is expected to do well, he has the best post game of any prospect in 1-2 decades! There's a reason that so many of us were in love with him. Personally I had Russell a millimeter above on draft night, I think it was the right pick. Regardless of what happens, we shouldn't be upset with the past.  That being said, Russell will become a generational star, so none of this matters ;)"
lakers,3ceidv,rjvir,3,Tue Jul 7 09:09:45 2015 UTC,"Man, you just have the post draft jitters.  Okafor looked exactly like Okafor.  No revelations."
lakers,3ceidv,dood23,4,Tue Jul 7 08:32:34 2015 UTC,Mitch McGary dropped 19 tonight. Myles Turner dropped 20/8 last night. You can go ahead and take stats in the SL with a grain of salt. Didn't the Kings somehow win SL Champs last year? They didn't even have that great of a young core.   I'd rather have Russell & Hibbert than (more than likely) Rondo & Okafor.
lakers,3ceidv,badguymatt,7,Tue Jul 7 07:54:32 2015 UTC,"That's why I didn't bring up stats, just the way he played and what I saw. I have been watching the NBA for close to 40 years now and recognize a future star when I see one."
lakers,3ceidv,badguymatt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:00:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean.. the way someone played and their stats are literally the same thing. Didn't Dante Exum just drop 20, 5 & 5 as well? It's not like Okafor was gonna be a scrub, but I do think Russell will be better.   But you should be ecstatic with Russell, my man.   Jah still has plenty of flaws in his game, but I can easily see Okafor becoming a perineal All-Star as well.   Very, very, very small and weak sample size though. I think we should come back to this question around February."
lakers,3ceidv,StealthRUs,-7,Tue Jul 7 08:04:31 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Russell & Hibbert than (more than likely) Rondo & Okafor.    I would, too.  But I'd take Okafor and Lin over Russell and Hibbert."
lakers,3ceidv,santokimilktea,4,Tue Jul 7 13:46:30 2015 UTC,Ugh please watch the actual games and NOT the highlights. Same thing happened last year with Randle. Randle didnt really look good in SL but everyone was hyping over his highlight reel. Not that SL means anything what so ever but at least look at the whole game lol    Okafor got blocked like a million times and was a huge liability at the defense even completely giving away the last dagger because he couldn't get back on D. Of course anyone looks good if you just look at the shots he made but a little worrisome on the shots he was struggling with. He still looks like he's struggling conditioning wise.   Again he may get better at all his flaws. He may be stuck with them who knows. But his SL debut hasn't changed anything and just further shows his downsides as well as his offensive abilities
lakers,3ceidv,alexcustom6877,3,Tue Jul 7 12:25:43 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say, I saw A LOT of flaws as well.   For example, multiple times during the game if you'll watch, you'll notice the guard bringing up the ball beats Okafor to that side on offense and they start to attack the basket because it's less clogged, and then Okafor struts in late and literally almost runs into where the the guard is attacking and forces them to alter their shot.   He needs to work on his conditioning and drive, because I see him as the talent that receives so much praise that they almost feel they hardly need to change anything.  Obviously that will change, and I see Okafor succeeding in the league, but he definitely didn't look perfect out there.   Revisit this post after you see Russell at least play a game."
lakers,3ceidv,sirender72,2,Tue Jul 7 12:41:13 2015 UTC,"As someone who was pro Okafor before the draft, I feel like we still made the right choice. Both him and Russell will be great talents in this league, but watching Russell and the way he's carried himself in interviews... he's a natural born leader. His leadership mentality and court vision isn't something you can teach, and I think those qualities make him the right choice to hopefully become the future leader of this franchise."

lakers,3c85l9,TuneHD,7,Sun Jul 5 23:21:47 2015 UTC,What part of that sounded serious? Young and Lou being prime Kobe or an undrafted rookie averaging 15 blocks a game?
lakers,3c85l9,TuneHD,0,Mon Jul 6 01:05:53 2015 UTC,Blocks in college aren't the same as blocks in the NBA - Upshaw still has a long way to go until he's an NBA-level defender. I like him a lot though so I'm pushing for him!
lakers,3c85l9,spudwinkle,5,Mon Jul 6 01:27:46 2015 UTC,I think it's pretty obvious I was joking.

lakers,3c85l9,polvitos,2,Sun Jul 5 20:22:57 2015 UTC,Is it possible he got traded in the hibbert trade? How do we offer lou 7 million when we only have 5 million in cap space. Unless lakers know they can trade swaggy somewhere

lakers,3c85l9,SwolebrohamLincoln,3,Sun Jul 5 21:31:55 2015 UTC,Very solid pickup
lakers,3c85l9,SwolebrohamLincoln,3,Sun Jul 5 20:26:46 2015 UTC,"Wow. Welcome to LA, Lou Williams. My thoughts:  1) With plays like this, I think Lou will fit on a team with Mamba and Swaggy just fine.  2) It'll be exciting to see how long Hibbert lasts covering for Russell, Kobe, Swaggy, and Randle on defense before he loses it and kills everyone.  3) Speaking of Swaggy, I'm pretty sure this means he's on his way out. Too many mouths to feed and just one ball. Last time I checked, the Hibbert trade left something like ~$5M in LA's cap space.  4) Re: #3, with a Russell/Clarkson/Williams backcourt (along with Swaggy possibly being traded), this probably means Kobe's gonna be playing a good bit of SF next season.   5) It's nice that we made an impact (instant offense/reigning 6MOY) signing, but I'm not a huge fan. I guess this signing is a recognition that Kobe's gonna get games off (whether due to injuries or just rest). Still, backcourt depth wasn't an issue, and I would have rather chased Cory Joseph or KJ McDaniels, notwithstanding both of them being RFAs."
lakers,3c85l9,polvitos,16,Sun Jul 5 20:20:51 2015 UTC,"I know this sounds ridiculous, but I honestly think Mitch's goal for this season is to have everyone look at the Lakers and say, ""Wow, they would be a legit team if they didn't have a giant, Kevin-Durant-sized hole at SF.""  And then next summer he will pitch that to Durant and say, ""Okay, Mr. Durant, what coach do you want and what other player would you like us to offer a max contract to?"""
lakers,3c85l9,Duck_Matthew5,7,Sun Jul 5 20:47:55 2015 UTC,"""Scott Brooks and my man Kendrick Perkins""  Mitch retires because of a brain aneurysm."
lakers,3c85l9,Umgator,8,Sun Jul 5 20:18:39 2015 UTC,"The only SF I wouldve liked with that cap space is McDaniels, but sometimes you just gotta get assets however you can. I heard that we still have a 2.8m slot to use on another FA, but I dunno who is out there for that money."
lakers,3c85l9,davesuperstar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:39:59 2015 UTC,"Might still be a possibility. If anything, trade deadline comes around, and some playoff team desperately wants to trade for some bench offense which we now have on a good contract.   Example: This past season the Suns dealt newly acquired Isaiah Thomas to the Celtics for the Cavs 2016 1st rounder."
lakers,3c85l9,swaggerqueen16,3,Mon Jul 6 00:49:20 2015 UTC,I think you gotta have some veteran talent locked in for a couple of years to attract free agents next offseason. Lou with Clarkson and Russell is nice.

lakers,3c85l9,TuneHD,4,Sun Jul 5 21:08:07 2015 UTC,"Makes no sense, Swaggy is only 5mil and is the same player as Lou Will. So we pay 7mil for a guy we already have?"
lakers,3c85l9,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,3,Sun Jul 5 20:41:46 2015 UTC,"Kobe, Swaggy, and Lou Williams will be putting up shots instead of letting Russell and Randle get touches. I really hope Lou tries to be more of a playmaker this year or else we have too many chuckers who suck at defense on this team."
lakers,3c85l9,TuneHD,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:50:33 2015 UTC,Swaggy and Lou will be on the bench so they're not really going to be taking touches away from our starters. Kobe has no issues feeding the ball to people as long as they score. If you watched last season the only person Kobe passed the ball to was Hill since he was always set at mid range and knocked them down at a high rate. Everybody else would literally drop the ball or get blocked. if you even followed Kobe throughout his career you'd see he passes a lot.
lakers,3c85l9,The1percenter,0,Sun Jul 5 20:54:13 2015 UTC,"Lou will be playing 6th man minutes so yes he will be taking touches from the starters, unless for some reason Byron Scott adopts Coach Cal's platoon swap strategy. Also I have watched almost every game this season and yes I have followed Kobe throughout his career, I'm a Lakers fan... It's obvious Kobe is a volume shooter, dude was putting up more shot attempts than points this season, he is a great passer but it is an overstatement to say he passes a lot."
lakers,3c85l9,TuneHD,4,Sun Jul 5 21:24:08 2015 UTC,"Overstatement? Then how is he ranked #30 of all time in assists? Look at Shaq and Gasol times, he always fed them then closed out the games. They've said it themselves, we've watched it happen, and Kobe's stats back it up. When he got flack for volume shooting last season, he literally passed all game and we still lose since guys weren't scoring. He even notched his career assists record."
lakers,3c85l9,denimourson,0,Sun Jul 5 21:46:48 2015 UTC,"Kobe is a shoot-first player, I know he is a great passer, I mentioned this, I watch Kobe, I know that he passes but I guess we have different definitions of ""passing a lot"""
lakers,3c85l9,MikeMcNorv,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:23:43 2015 UTC,"He's a shooting guard who has been the best player in the league for many years and has been one of the best in the league until he got injured in 2012.

lakers,3c85l9,tcorb95,2,Sun Jul 5 23:17:36 2015 UTC,He was 6th man of the year. I'll take that.
lakers,3c85l9,KookLife,0,Sun Jul 5 22:13:38 2015 UTC,"6th Man of the Year so he's good but in terms of fit I think it's okay. He puts up a lot of shots and doesn't look to pass often and is also bad on defense, so he's very similar to Kobe and Swaggy. Lou and Nick Young might chuck up shots instead of passing the rock and letting our young guys get touches. But on the bright side he'll help us compete this year and make a name for ourselves which will come in handy next offseason. Also be prepared for countless step back long twos and threes."

We got a rim protector for pretty much nothing and if he does well we can sign him for long term. Now we have the reigning 6th man of the year to backup Russell. We may not win a ton of games next season but we are better set up for the future by avoiding the players and deals a lot of you wanted the lakers to go after. Not only is the Lou Williams signing good for us now but we could trade him in 2 years for a good return."

lakers,3c85l9,CaptainRatTrap,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:20:21 2015 UTC,That's a pretty good deal although we really need to sign up a quality SF or at least bring back Wesley Johnson. If not then at least we have Anthony Brown.

To add to all that, he hasn't meshed well with Scott either, and Scott is known to wear on guys."
lakers,3c8sz9,purplecorazon,8,Mon Jul 6 01:35:46 2015 UTC,No way dude. Odom was above and beyond Young in work ethic and discipline.

They don't NEED to include salary in the HIbbert deal to make it work.    Now maybe they want to do the move because Indiana really wants Young or the Lakers think it's time to move on from Young, but either way it's not necessary to make trades work like they're claiming."

lakers,3c9vjn,lakers__sad_summer,-2,Mon Jul 6 10:49:18 2015 UTC,Hell no I wouldn't. Those three actually work together in terms of spacing the positions they play and at least one (Clarkson) has proven he can play efficiently in the league.   I'd need to be proven wrong next year to even consider that trade.
lakers,3c9vjn,lebronsucks123,2,Mon Jul 6 07:08:07 2015 UTC,Did you forget that Wiggins was rookie of the year?

lakers,3c9vjn,TuneHD,2,Mon Jul 6 08:52:11 2015 UTC,I'd rather have TWolve's young core to be honest. They have 2 guys in Wiggins and Towns who can become the best in their position or at least in the discussion as 2 way players with athleticism. I wouldn't say 76ers have a better young core since they have a PF and 2 centers which won't really work when they actually play. I'd say our core has the potential to be the best since we have 3 guys who could become all star caliber players while most others only have 2.
lakers,3c9vjn,StealthRUs,2,Mon Jul 6 11:59:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say 76ers have a better young core since they have a PF and 2 centers which won't really work when they actually play.   And they have Stauskas now.  Having 2 potential franchise centers on the roster is not a bad problem to have.  I would still take the 76ers young core over ours.  If Embiid is healthy and he and Okafor both pan out, Okafor is a hell of a chip to trade.  They could move him for Simmons next year, if they don't end up with the top pick."
lakers,3c9vjn,swaggerqueen16,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:52:30 2015 UTC,Jordan Clarkson is a monster. Made NBA 1st Team All-Rookie on last 20 games alone. Will be better than Wiggins. Fact.   https://twitter.com/ChrisPalmerNBA/status/617943628653002752

Lavine has hops and is decent at handling the ball, but he's a poor shooter, bad defender, and has a pretty low basketball IQ. Rumors out of UCLA were that he was a bit hard headed as well.  There's a reason why his win share and adjusted/real +/- were so bad last year. He's a high usage low efficiency player. No thank you. And I say that as a die hard Bruin."

lakers,3ccfgs,TheAsianMamba,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:10:16 2015 UTC,"I feel 45 is the highest possible ceiling. Healthy kobe, rookies come out doing work off the gate, etc and it's possible.

lakers,3c9xrl,BeefCat10,22,Mon Jul 6 06:33:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll be better than maple jordan, but I do think everyone is sleeping on him. Max Kellerman is calling him a glorified backup, people in this sub echoing the same thing, clipper announcers were using the lazy ""best player on a bad team"" argument.   I don't think anyone who makes those claims actually watched him play. I watched every game, and post-ASG, Clarkson was scoring in spite of being the only offensive threat on the team. He always had to create his own shots while opposing defenders slacked off kelly and wes, still finding seams, improving his mid range jumper, and training with Nash to do that baseline run kick out maneuver. Dude is a beast, and I'm hoping people start to respect his game rather than discredit it. Imagine if we didn't buy that pick from Wash, we'd be one of the other 29 teams kicking ourselves for passing on this 6'5"" combo guard who models his game after Westbrook."
lakers,3c9xrl,bul1dog,15,Mon Jul 6 06:45:58 2015 UTC,Its not like Wiggins played on a good team either lol people just like to shit on Clarkson.

lakers,3c9xrl,bul1dog,5,Mon Jul 6 16:56:12 2015 UTC,Right on. No one would be acting like Clarkson isn't shit if he were drafted 16th instead 46th. The crazy thing is he was projected as a fringe lottery pick during the season. His play took a nose dive and so did his stock. Athletically the dudes belongs on the court with anyone. Pretty solid shooter and his court vision and playmaking ability could use some work but he flashed brilliance. I am sold on him being a starting caliber guard in the NBA right now. How good can he be idk. I guess we will see
lakers,3c9xrl,FreshDiamond,2,Mon Jul 6 06:55:05 2015 UTC,"Next year will be very telling. I hope he takes the next step, he's better than we could have ever hoped."
lakers,3c9xrl,rtrainer30,0,Mon Jul 6 06:50:34 2015 UTC,"I think those that used the ""someone had to score on a bad team"" or ""best player on a bad team"" were incorrectly diminishing his value as a player but you seem to be in the camp where you are overvaluing him. Reality is that Clarkson is a nice young player but he's skillset doesnt project to anything more than solid starter to back up PG. He does a lot of things well like you mentioned, but nothing at a high level. Isnt a great defender, passer, playmaker, shooter, slasher or finisher; he's okay at all those things, but OK does not make an All-Star player."
lakers,3c9xrl,KennyPOV,22,Mon Jul 6 13:59:43 2015 UTC,His Per 36 stats were better than wiggins idk he has an opinion both made All rookie 1st team. I feel like Lakers fans under rate Clarkson alot.

Clarkson shot significantly better and is a lot better playmaker than Wiggins. 48% fg post all star break is amazing for a rookie
lakers,3c9xrl,KennyPOV,2,Mon Jul 6 07:41:08 2015 UTC,"Yea Wiggins played 1 year of college, and he's arguably the best athlete in the league. I don't have to undervalue Clarkson in order to safely assume Wiggins will be the better player long-term."
lakers,3c9xrl,moserftbl88,6,Mon Jul 6 06:39:57 2015 UTC,Yes that is true but they both made All rookie first team. As you have the opinion that Wiggins will be better I just made the point that it isnt CRAZY for someone like Palmer to have the other opinion.
lakers,3c9xrl,DeangeloRussell,-5,Mon Jul 6 06:52:44 2015 UTC,"As someone who covers basketball for a living, it's absolutely nuts at this point in their careers to be 100% certain that Jordan Clarkson will be better than Andrew Wiggins."
lakers,3c9xrl,KennyPOV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:54:23 2015 UTC,"It's not really that shocking. It's a slightly different situation but writers do this stuff all the time just to get their name out there for instance last year there were a few people saying things like ""Anthony Davis will be the next star in this league. Book it"" is anybody shocked by that? He was drafted first overall and has been a beast it's not a shocking proclamation. This isn't the same thing but somewhat close. If clarkson ends up being amazing then he looks smart for saying it years ago. It's just what writers do."
lakers,3c9xrl,DeangeloRussell,-4,Mon Jul 6 15:10:44 2015 UTC,You are delusional if you think clarkson is better than wiggins. Plain and simple.
lakers,3c9xrl,KennyPOV,5,Mon Jul 6 06:47:01 2015 UTC,I never said that I just pointed out that his Per 36 were better. If I said that Clarkson was better than him then you could say I said that.
lakers,3c9xrl,DeangeloRussell,-7,Mon Jul 6 06:49:13 2015 UTC,"yes we know he's good...the original post is about him being better than wiggins though, so I don't see the relevance of your post if that's not what your implying"
lakers,3c9xrl,aveydey,6,Mon Jul 6 06:51:42 2015 UTC,The relevance in my post was to explain to the people that are shitting on Palmer that they both made All rookie first team. They both played on bad teams so people cant use that excuse only for Clarkson so its not crazy for someone like Palmer to think Clarkson could be better.
lakers,3c9xrl,stafreshi,0,Mon Jul 6 06:54:36 2015 UTC,What...no one is denying he made first team...they're more amused that the guy thinks clarkson will be better than wiggins. If you watch both players you know that's horseshit.
lakers,3c9xrl,thesplashman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:59:00 2015 UTC,"Dude Deangelo, don't worry , bro.. Clarkson is going to play the 2 and you'll get to run the point. Chill!"
lakers,3c9xrl,lakers__sad_summer,3,Mon Jul 6 13:42:23 2015 UTC,"dude has a lot of irrational takes, but he's a secret Lakers fan so you can't blame him. however, I do enjoy his #LOTN and top 5 lists sometimes"
lakers,3c9xrl,lakers__sad_summer,2,Mon Jul 6 06:38:00 2015 UTC,"Him having the audacity to write ""Fact."" at the end of that just makes it hilarious"
lakers,3c9xrl,TweetPoster,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:38:54 2015 UTC,"Clarkson finished the year being a better player Per 36 stats (as stated by /u/KennyPOV) so he was right. :P  And people underrate JC, really badly. He's only going to get better once him and Julius Randle play on the floor together bc their style of play is so synergistic.   idgaf about Wiggins. Is he a Laker? No! He can eff off than. He's the enemy, OP. :P"
lakers,3c9xrl,Lakesh0w,3,Mon Jul 6 07:04:14 2015 UTC,"I understand people might be undervaluing Clarkson some, but it's way worse to assume he's going to be better than Wiggins by examining stats in their rookie years, especially when Clarkson is significantly older"
lakers,3c9xrl,TuneHD,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:08:03 2015 UTC,"He was better last year, was the point. And yes, JC does have the benefit of being 3 years older coming into the NBA.  I'm not going to say he is or isn't but I'm a stubborn mofo (and an admitted homer). So stop talking about non-laker players who can go shove sticks up their own asses. GO LAKERS! :P"

lakers,3c9xrl,lakers__sad_summer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:34:33 2015 UTC,I'd love to see him be right
lakers,3c9xrl,gpholmes1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:35:27 2015 UTC,"I think Wiggins is better and will end up better than Clarkson, but I don't think they're going to be far off. Wiggins could be a top 3/5 2 way player in a few years. I see project Wiggins as being a Paul George at best and Kawhi Leonard at worst. With Clarkson I see him being a Damian Lillard at best and Reggie Jackson at worst. Wiggins had the advantage of starting and taking on the load an entire season whereas Clarkson only had a third of the season to really develop and shine."
lakers,3c9wx6,gratisfactionn,3,Mon Jul 6 06:22:29 2015 UTC,"He seems to be very, very good at shooting while drifting to his left. Which is a really weird thing to be good at."
lakers,3c9wx6,SamiAbK,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:51:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly a little bit worrisome in terms of the ball dominance in that entire highlight clip. Definitely a 6th man type volume shooter that can create his own shot. I'd love to see how he plays off the ball and if he can dish it out to an open player, but saw none of that there (maybe he does do that).   Not too worried about it this next season (we probably need someone like him), but hopefully he can be consistent. A type of player who if he has a bad shooting night could really put a game away from reach."

lakers,3cdjjg,m-teezzy,3,Tue Jul 7 01:57:21 2015 UTC,"We're not about to bring on two additional point guards when we have Russell, Williams and Clarkson who can play point as well. While we're getting rid of Young no matter what, this here would leave us with SIX guards. No way we're doing that."
lakers,3cdjjg,WOX_69,3,Tue Jul 7 02:28:25 2015 UTC,"Taking on Swaggy isn't something they want to do, especially if it means getting rid of Harris and anderson.  That would leave them with only Lin and Barea at the pg and whoever they could get with the vet's minimum.  They also have Parsons, Jefferson and Anderson at the 3 right now, why sacrifice pg depth and Anderson's upside and cheap contract to add Swaggy when they are already set at the 3?"
lakers,3cdjjg,_im_on_acid_,0,Tue Jul 7 03:00:08 2015 UTC,Swag can play the 2 which he can do for the mavs. Lin and Barea should be enough but i want anderson on the lakers pretty bad so any deal that brings him here and just cut harris and felton.
lakers,3cdjjg,nluna1975,2,Tue Jul 7 05:09:27 2015 UTC,"I think it will work out 3way between us and Pacers .. you guys still going for Hibbert right? And they going for Monta, we going for Lin"
lakers,3cdjjg,oz82,2,Tue Jul 7 02:15:14 2015 UTC,We love a good three-way
lakers,3cdjjg,jerkidiot,2,Tue Jul 7 02:18:23 2015 UTC,The whole reason Dallas wants Lin is because they don't have a starting point guard. I don't see them trading all their PG depth to get a starter.
lakers,3cdjjg,eriiccc,2,Tue Jul 7 06:07:23 2015 UTC,Aren't the lakers looking just to get cash for Lin?
lakers,3cdjjg,locallyunknown,1 point,Tue Jul 7 08:11:46 2015 UTC,dont we have enough guards on this team though?? why bring up 3 more
lakers,3ca7ic,aguilae,2,Mon Jul 6 08:54:54 2015 UTC,"I like him too, especially from his days in Golden State. I think he's more suited to the bench. If the Lakers are serious about making the playoffs or competing for them, they need to add a starting caliber guy. I'm hoping Landry Fields, or Gerald Green. I think Wright can help a team by adding depth, but I think the lakers should address the starting position more. He's better than Wesley, so I'll give you that lol."
lakers,3ca7ic,CoolScales,10,Mon Jul 6 14:45:53 2015 UTC,"Starting caliber guy and Landy Fields should not be in the same sentence unless the phrase ""will never be"" is there"
lakers,3ca7ic,AdrianWojnarowiski,3,Mon Jul 6 15:35:47 2015 UTC,"If we could start Wesley, we could start Dorell lol. I don't think we have enough money to sign any big names at SF anyway. Plus, Dorell puts up good numbers when given minutes. I feel like it's a good move for the FO to consider, but hey i'm no Mitch lol"
lakers,3c8kud,lakerswiz,6,Sun Jul 5 22:28:09 2015 UTC,Snell or Gibson. If true that would be great for us.
lakers,3c8kud,SSD65,10,Sun Jul 5 22:41:54 2015 UTC,Hopefully for a SF. Tony Snell maybe?
lakers,3c8kud,lemp44,10,Sun Jul 5 22:35:03 2015 UTC,"Snell only makes like $1.5 million though. If Lin was willing to sign for that much, he'd just take the minimum in Dallas.  Now if it's a Snell + Gibson deal....for Hill and Lin it makes more sense...that would be about $10 million in salary.  Hill and Lin on $5 million deals seems likely."
lakers,3c8kud,PhilDunphy_,5,Sun Jul 5 22:39:22 2015 UTC,You would not get snell plus taj for Lin and Hill. That's a straight trade rape.
lakers,3c8kud,nocioniisgod,0,Mon Jul 6 19:54:43 2015 UTC,"Snell + Taj for Lin + Hill is lopsided in favor of the Lakers even if Lin wasn't being sign & traded. But he is, which gives the Lakers even a bit less bargaining power"
lakers,3c8kud,TimeisIllmatic95,3,Mon Jul 6 20:26:48 2015 UTC,That would be a sneaky good pickup.
lakers,3c8kud,apathetic-irony,2,Mon Jul 6 00:44:25 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be worth it for Tony. The only guy that really makes sense is Taj Gibson, but this would be majorly underselling him."
lakers,3c8kud,VladDracul_III,0,Sun Jul 5 22:52:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think we want Taj, he is wayyyy too injury prone. Basically a big man version of rose. Unless rose's injuries were contagious, and in that sense this trade will make sense."
lakers,3c8kud,joebxcsnw,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:58:03 2015 UTC,That would be nice. Snell is a Cali kid too. Went to King High School in Riverside with Kawhi.
lakers,3c8kud,YungGeneric,28,Mon Jul 6 05:28:09 2015 UTC,For Jimmy Butler

D'Antoni wasn't a good coach for Pau but we fired D'Antoni.  We offered Pau 12 mil last offseason but he instead chose to go to an East contender.  He hasn't been treated like shit, but he wasn't treated like the Laker Legend that he really is.  Mitch said as much when asked at the end of this season if there was anything he wished he could change his answer was to keep Pau, he wished he could undo that and that he felt Pau deserved better and if he could change anything that's what he'd change. Not D'Antoni, not Kobe's contract... Losing Pau.  So do I think Mitch would love to trade Hill and Lin for Pau? Hell yes I do.  Would I feel sad for Pau to come home to LA and play with 2 upcoming rookies, Kobe and a great defensive Center?  Hell no I wouldn't."
lakers,3c8kud,JustAGuy993,2,Mon Jul 6 01:12:03 2015 UTC,The only way we have a chance of getting Pau is for some players to develop so much throughout the season and to win out in Free Agency next year so L.A. can sign him outright.    Hopefully it's like the season Fisher returned.

They just are, it's not even a conversation.   I also think SAC is SIGNIFICANTLY more talented (DMC, Gay, WCS, Rondo, Collison) but we'll see if Karl can get all their egos on 1 page.

Utah was 1 of the top 10 teams in the league after trading Kanter and making Gobert a starter, and there's really little reason to think they won't keep building on that.  SAC has a top 10 player and 1 of the all time winningest coaches in NBA history, along with just a crazy amount of talent. They just need to set chemistry issues aside.  I could maybe give you PHX - depending on what they do with their recently carved out cap space.  I'm just not sure where people are forming these expectations for our team."

lakers,3cblyj,ryanm37,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:25:56 2015 UTC,"I agree, I hope we can we shed a bit of salary by getting rid of Nick Young, and maybe picking up someone via trade mid season."
lakers,3cblyj,SSD65,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:27:17 2015 UTC,"Respectable gets you noticed. Respectable shows that we are playing real ball. Respectable gets you those FA signings. I can't wait to forget about last year. This offseason has been amazing imo... All we lost was a second rounder but received a contract year Roy Hibbert. We signed a better Swaggy p, and have some great veteran presence for our rookies. However, this team in a couple years man. This team... :)"
lakers,3cblyj,RyanLaFalce,0,Mon Jul 6 17:31:07 2015 UTC,"Having Lou is much better than Swaggy P. He was entertaining while we were struggling in the past two seasons, but shedding his salary for potential trades or another FA is a no brainer. Maybe I'm just not a fan of his, but I'm glad we picked up Lou, and hopefully we can get rid of Nick Young."
lakers,3cblyj,VladDracul_III,2,Mon Jul 6 17:38:30 2015 UTC,"I say seeds 1-7 are already taken, and it'll be a dogfight for the 8th seed. I hope we can slip into the 8th seed because who doesn't love playoff basketball. I'd love for the Spurs to get the #1 seed so we can upset them. Imagine that."

lakers,3cblyj,StealthRUs,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:01:31 2015 UTC,I can definitely see the Lakers upsetting the Spurs if they can squeeze at No.8. Of course this is all very much surrounded around the fact that more pieces will need to be moved from and to the roster so we have a larger veteran presence other than Kobe. I think the way Roy Hibbert plays is going to be a huge factor. The last few years in Indiana weren't his best but LA could be his revival and a place where he can continue the tradition of Hall of Fame big men that have worn Purple&Gold.
lakers,3cblyj,stevebeyten,4,Mon Jul 6 17:53:19 2015 UTC,I can definitely see the Lakers upsetting the Spurs if they can squeeze at No.8.    What the actual fuck? What world do you live in....?
lakers,3cblyj,stevebeyten,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:05:10 2015 UTC,Must be the world where the Spurs didn't just add LMA to their already loaded roster.
lakers,3cblyj,ape_cage,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned above, this is purely hypothetical. We are yet to see on-court synergy from the Lakers or the Spurs, and therefore we are allowed to hypothesize about what could potentially transpire. Most of this conversation is based on speculation simply because we barely started Summer Season, and October 29th is still months away."
lakers,3cblyj,_im_on_acid_,3,Mon Jul 6 18:08:42 2015 UTC,"I mean... you can frame it however way you want - the Spurs won 55 games to our 21 last year ... and they have done MORE to improve their roster than we have.   So yeah, I guess there is a ""hypothetical"" scenario where LMA and Kawhi LITERALLY murder each other, but beyond that... we don't belong in the same gym as the Spurs this season."
lakers,3cblyj,TuneHD,0,Mon Jul 6 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"Haha nothing is impossible, this is starting to remind me of the post finals Nike billboard for Lebron. -Imagine if everyone counted them out. -Imagine if they faced the top seed in the west. -Imagine if they defied odds, logic and the basketball gods to come back and win the series in 7.

lakers,3c8r8l,lolxddavid,2,Sun Jul 5 23:30:03 2015 UTC,I assume it's him considering the cap we have for Lou and Bass and we still need money for backup PG.
lakers,3c8r8l,TweetPoster,0,Sun Jul 5 23:42:06 2015 UTC,"I'd think so. Though we also have that pending sign and trade for Lin with Dallas so that TPE may come into account as well, assuming we get no players back from Dallas."
lakers,3c8r8l,Cincybengals7,2,Sun Jul 5 23:47:38 2015 UTC,Why does everybody want to send Nick Young away
lakers,3c8r8l,GeorgeLovesBOSCO,5,Mon Jul 6 00:52:50 2015 UTC,"I initially liked his energy and positive attitude which kept people and the team positive when they were at their low.  However, his arrogance and overall attitude will be toxic to the new players looking to develop in the nba. As are his ill-advised shot attempts. Basically, too many rookie characteristics for a player that should be filling a more veteran role."
lakers,3cb6nu,rejectx,5,Mon Jul 6 15:24:52 2015 UTC,I think kelly and sacre will be heading to indiana in the roy hibbert trade to off set the trade kicker. And nick young we might try to involve him in a sign and trade.
lakers,3cb6nu,jaysteezy24,5,Mon Jul 6 16:08:25 2015 UTC,"In regards to Nick Young, I don't care. Just get him the hell out of here."

lakers,3cb6nu,C3PO1Fan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:38:47 2015 UTC,"I got the Lakers roster size at 14.  That leaves them a space for  Upshaw if they like him.    But also most of the roster either is not guaranteed or affordable to release.   So I'd rather keep these players around until some need requires space to be made.  The remaining players available right now may not be upgrades, but other good players may be available later."
lakers,3cb6nu,magneto44,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:14:03 2015 UTC,I don't think Nance or Upshaw necessarily makes the roster this quick.
lakers,3cb6nu,wanderfound,8,Mon Jul 6 15:28:57 2015 UTC,Nance will absolutely make the roster next year. And if Upshaw has a decent summer league I don't know why he couldn't take Sacre's role as a 3rd center who won't play unless someone is injured.
lakers,3cb6nu,FreshDiamond,5,Mon Jul 6 15:31:00 2015 UTC,Nance has a multiple year guaranteed contract so he's here to stay.
lakers,3cb6nu,lakers__sad_summer,3,Mon Jul 6 15:50:03 2015 UTC,There is a pretty good chance nance will take up the 14th or fifteenth roster spot most of the year and not play at all. There are a lot of rookies that don't see the court even on bad teams. Late first round picks really aren't very valuable.  Sure you find gems like butler or gobert but most of these guys either find a niche and become a good role player or find themselves out of the league in a couple years. I don't expect to see much Larry nance this year.
lakers,3cb6nu,BABYPUBESS,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:14:17 2015 UTC,"Nick young is 6'6"" and Lou Williams is 6'2"". idk about replacing straight up bc NY has length to play SF. If Mavs are dumb enough to trade Justin Anderson (in a Lin sign and trade), that would be awesome! A.Brown is fine too, I guess (funny how much AB looks like NY, too lol).  Ryan Kelly is replaced by anyone bc he's just not needed here. Robert Sacre is an asset better than RK bc he can be plugged in as a meh second and ok third string C on any team for 1mil. Sacre prob wont be back and traded."
lakers,3cb6nu,lakers__sad_summer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:50:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think Nick Young is more of a SF, he's played more 2 guard throughout his career and can get pushed around by most of the 3s in the league."

lakers,3c92pz,yatrickmith,6,Mon Jul 6 01:13:09 2015 UTC,"yes I think we want the 8th seed, give Kobe one more run in the playoffs, and we don't have a draft pick in 2016 to tank for. I think it's doable if our young talent can produce"
lakers,3c92pz,tiagoroco,8,Mon Jul 6 02:02:32 2015 UTC,The Clippers minus Deandre aren't a playoff lock anymore. The West is no joke and that's a huge loss for a team that already had no depth.
lakers,3c92pz,GreatAmerican1776,7,Mon Jul 6 02:24:45 2015 UTC,I think Chris Paul and Blake Griffon will still be able to propel them into the playoffs for now. They won't have a run at the finals but they'll be in the playoffs.
lakers,3c92pz,superindian25,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:40:34 2015 UTC,Are you kidding me? Two top 10 players will put you in the playoffs easily. Especially since CP3 is arguably the best pg in the league and Blake is arguably a top 2 pf in the league.
lakers,3c92pz,iBangTurtles,2,Mon Jul 6 09:49:58 2015 UTC,The issue with that is they're both really big playmakers. They both have also had injury issues where they have to sit part of the season pretty often. I don't think they can carry the team without a rim protector since DJ's defense covered up Blake's shortcomings. They were really the best frontcourt duo since they were insanely athletic and their skillsets meshed extremely well. I'd say 7th and 8th seeds aren't a lock. That's without counting injury.
lakers,3c92pz,TuneHD,2,Mon Jul 6 11:46:36 2015 UTC,"we want to make 8th because we probably won't get our 1st rounder since it has to be top 3, so no point in tanking.  we have some nice vets and a promising young core but even bottom feeder west teams like sac and min are better than us.  i predict no playoffs and about 30-35 wins."

lakers,3c92pz,flea61,3,Mon Jul 6 06:40:46 2015 UTC,I say we do so the pick we send to the 76ers is high. Plus the better our team looks the bigger the chance we land a free agent. We are just proving everyone right if we suck.

lakers,3c92pz,joelee1711,2,Mon Jul 6 06:44:36 2015 UTC,Not yet. The west is too strong.
lakers,3c92pz,joelee1711,2,Mon Jul 6 02:31:48 2015 UTC,"I would say Portland has as good of a chance to make the playoffs as we do, or even better.  They're definitely no longer a lock, but by not even placing them on the list that means you think they're the worst in the West?  P.S. you have two #1 seeds."
lakers,3c92pz,megavino,7,Mon Jul 6 01:27:36 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know how much Lillard could do by himself. Portland lost 4 starters. And I'm pretty sure, statistically, they had the worst bench in the league last season."
lakers,3c92pz,ashishvp,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:29:06 2015 UTC,"But now they have incredible frontline depth, with Gerald Henderson and McCollum as good role players for guards."
lakers,3c92pz,PaperDesk,2,Mon Jul 6 01:31:29 2015 UTC,"I actually do really like Gerald Henderson, but who is their SF, PF, C.   In terms of talent and potential, I really only see Lillard. Maybe they have other pieces I don't know about? But IMO, I think Portland will not make the playoffs and don't have a chance, due to the fact they lost everyone but Lillard.   Meyers Leonard did show some promise in last year's playoffs though.   Oh wait. I think they'll have Kaman at the C with Meyers at the 4?   But still, I think IMO, they'll be pretty bad."
lakers,3c92pz,GabrielRodriguez115,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:35:13 2015 UTC,"If you're looking at last years roster and just read that they lost 4 starters, then yeah i can see why you'd think they would be bad.  But they got free agents and acquired players in trades.  No stars, but really good depth.    SF: Aminu/Connaughton PF: Davis/Vonleh C: Leonard/Mason Plumlee/Kaman"

lakers,3c92pz,notsurewhatiam,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:30:05 2015 UTC,Utah is making the playoffs for sure. Gobert is dpoy if he plays like he did post all star break and rumor has it he's developing a midrange game. He's a good free throw shooter so its pretty possible. I can't see us being higher then a 10 seed but I can see is improving tremendously post all star break.
lakers,3c92pz,aveydey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:33:07 2015 UTC,I've said this dozens of times.  FUCK the draft pick. We don't need it and I don't like this years upcoming class. It's top 3 protected which is an INSANELY risky tank.   Also in free agency next year we're a MUCH more attractive team with 40-50 wins as opposed to a tanking 20 wins.   ANYWAY. OP you forgot the Blazers as a possible 8th seed. I doubt they'll make it because their team exploded. But Dame is still a beast. I could see him going full Westbrook this year.
lakers,3c92pz,Prince_Aladeen,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:16:17 2015 UTC,"I didn't forget the Blazers, and I respect your opinion, I seriously don't see them getting into the post-season.   Westbrook went full ""Westbrook"" with a cast of Dion Waiters, Serge Ibaka, Anthony Morrow, and Steven Adams.   Whereas Lillard going full ""Lillard"" with a cast of Noah Vonleh, Meyers Leonard, Chris Kaman, Gerald Henderson and CJ McCollum."
lakers,3c92pz,FreshDiamond,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:44:07 2015 UTC,"Plus Westbrook is actually a great two way player. I love Dame, but he doesn't have the all around game to do what Westbrook did. What Westbrook did was possibly once in a lifetime, even he might not be able to do it again if given the opportunity. Even with that once in a life time performance the Thunder still didn't make the playoffs. I put the Blazers chance to make the playoffs at about 0%."
lakers,3c92pz,aveydey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:55:55 2015 UTC,"Guys. I'd say PHX is the lock for the 8th.   But you can argue that either of the other teams, possibly even the Lakers have a chance at the post season."
lakers,3c92pz,Billcosbyspuddingpop,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:45:59 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your setup I definitely believe we put Clarkson starting 2 since his game would meld amazingly with russel. He is clearly meant for the 2. With Kobe at the 3. Randle at 4 and Upshaw and Hibbert alternating at the 5 I want to see Upshaw shine like he should but At the same time we have to remind him what he could lose if he doesn't stay clean by making Hibbert alternate. For the bench 4 and 3 we have a lot of options we have Kelly, nance, and brown. Depending on how well brown and nance do in the summer league should take the 3 and 4 respectively, I'd rather have people at the beginning of their careers get time than a non healthy person. The bench 5 can alternate between bass, Upshaw, Hibbert depending on the situation at hand and who pans out to be the best.   Oh and throw nick young out to sea, he can use iggy's butt as a floatation device maybe he can swim over to China to play there."
lakers,3c92pz,aveydey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:19:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'd have to say everything has to go right for us to get 8th seed. D'angelo and Randle need to have ROTY caliber seasons, Clarkson needs to continue his growth since he was a 3rd tier PG by the end of last season with potential to be a 2nd tier PG. Kobe is going to have to take a reduced load playing 25~28 minutes a game and trusting the new guys while helping them on the court with call outs. Hibbert is going to have to give us what he gave the Pacers during their contending days. Swaggy and Lou need to be a two headed dragon raining shots off the bench. A Brown has to become a solid backup 3&D guy to play off the ball to Lou and Nick. Upshaw has to get his act together and anchor the bench's defense."
lakers,3c92pz,Billcosbyspuddingpop,0,Mon Jul 6 11:50:44 2015 UTC,Nope. We're a 10th seed AT BEST and that's stretching it.
lakers,3c92pz,Billcosbyspuddingpop,-6,Mon Jul 6 12:55:26 2015 UTC,I don't think OKC is a lock for the playoffs.
lakers,3c92pz,FreshDiamond,4,Mon Jul 6 02:00:08 2015 UTC,You're insane if you don't think Okc makes the playoffs. Even without KD they were just one game away from making it last year.

lakers,3c92pz,Billcosbyspuddingpop,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:27:38 2015 UTC,Ok come remind me how wrong I was when they miss the playoffs again.
lakers,3c92pz,ashishvp,0,Mon Jul 6 18:28:05 2015 UTC,Ill bet you 500 dollars they dont miss the playoffs if KD and Russ both play at least 75 percent of the games. I dont understand how a logical basketball fan thinks that team will miss theplayoffs at full health
lakers,3c92pz,Occitzer,3,Tue Jul 7 04:51:07 2015 UTC,If KD and Wesbtbrook are healthy than absolutely they are a lock
lakers,3c92pz,FreshDiamond,3,Mon Jul 6 02:11:39 2015 UTC,Even if KD isn't healthy Russ can get them there if everyone else is. They had a laker like run of injuries this year.
lakers,3c92pz,FreshDiamond,-8,Mon Jul 6 05:47:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah? They didn't make the playoffs this year and they fired their coach.  They are definitely not a ""lock""."
lakers,3c92pz,PaperDesk,5,Mon Jul 6 02:14:22 2015 UTC,Youre clueless if you think they arent a lock at full health
lakers,3c73kb,sayheykid24,33,Sun Jul 5 14:13:38 2015 UTC,"Great points. In summary, SSR is saying that a proper big will help develop our perimeter players and teach where they can lose on defense so that it's not all on their shoulders when an assignment is blown. You can't learn proper team defense without a big playing proper defense.  Secondly it says that we need to uphold the franchise reputation to attract top FA in the future.  Honestly, I'm tired of all the shit posts on /r/nba saying that Lakers should purposely tank, especially since it's coming from perpetual lottery teams' fan base. The focus should be to develop our youth. It's only until after all star break that we should even start thinking about the lottery."
lakers,3c73kb,dendenmoooshi,4,Sun Jul 5 16:09:52 2015 UTC,"its a good trade because just like last year with Lin we have enough cap space to take the 15mil and its likely we'll either get him for free or maybe even get a pick with him. Sure Lin didnt bounce back to his NY form but it was still a great trade that got us Larry Nance Jr.  tl;dr its just worth it to take a chance with the guy, if its basically free."
lakers,3c73kb,howdoesilogin,5,Sun Jul 5 17:15:56 2015 UTC,"Not quite comparable because the lakers didn't get a pick. In reality, they gave up a pick. However, the lakers have plenty of youth right now so a 2nd rounder could be worth it."
lakers,3c73kb,Musingmike,-4,Sun Jul 5 17:18:52 2015 UTC,Well we dont know the full details yet so maybe we'll get one.
lakers,3c73kb,howdoesilogin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:58:58 2015 UTC,"Up until we signed any players, I was advocating that we just go into the first game and start all of our rookies and just see what happens. I wouldn't consider that tanking, just not signing marginally better players for the sake of it.  Now that we have started making moves, I definitely think we are heading in the right direction. Outside of the advantage of getting a few mid tier solid players, Hibbert is a solid trade chip as an expiring, Lou is on a reasonable contract as well if he start's producing at a high level.   It's true we all need to calm down, but outside of all of us not posting until all the moves are in, we are just reacting to what we see coming in. I'm stoked to see where this season takes us though"
lakers,3c73kb,KookLife,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:00:39 2015 UTC,"sorry but when the cap is increasing by like 30m - an expiring contract means little.  Hibbert will provide a shot blocker who will at least make people driving think twice.  Offensively and on the boards he might even be a bit of a downgrade, but a far better defensive player"
lakers,3c73kb,Drak_is_Right,12,Mon Jul 6 04:45:11 2015 UTC,I'm waiting for Dan Gilbert to screw this up for us.
lakers,3c73kb,PineappleGrenade,9,Sun Jul 5 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"It's a great damage control trade. I think he can put together a strong season for us, personally. With Indiana he was asked to score because that's what they needed. With us, he's just gonna be playing defense. We have plenty of players who can put the ball in the net. We just need him to lock the paint down for us. I could see this being a steal and bringing him back on a longer term deal in all honesty. He may not be the most aggressive rebounder or scorer but his interior defense is definitely elite when he's motivated."
lakers,3c73kb,Chilled_Penguin,6,Sun Jul 5 18:08:12 2015 UTC,I wonder if we did this trade first if it would have helped get a big FA signing
lakers,3c73kb,kneemahp,3,Sun Jul 5 19:30:06 2015 UTC,The rest of the roster is still very unproven. The free agent signings so far have made good sense for those involved.
lakers,3c73kb,omarciddo,3,Sun Jul 5 19:33:46 2015 UTC,"Moot point, if we made this trade we wouldn't have money for a big FA"
lakers,3c73kb,FreshDiamond,4,Sun Jul 5 21:56:18 2015 UTC,"My English isn't that good, how much do Lakers need to pay him? 15 millions for 1 year? Didn't know he worth that much...."
lakers,3c73kb,LikeIFuckingCare,4,Sun Jul 5 20:22:31 2015 UTC,"Bigs are paid a lot in the league, also his presence alone in the paint makes your team a top 10 defense."
lakers,3c73kb,undercoverbrutha,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:34:17 2015 UTC,"he isn't.  In free agency 3 years ago Trailblazers offered him a max contract (he was a restricted free agent).  Pacers had to match it or lose him.  At the time he was an enticing developing player.  The first year, he was worth every bit.  Second and third years, not so much.  His offensive numbers have slid, particularly his efficiency."

lakers,3c73kb,Drak_is_Right,3,Mon Jul 6 04:55:07 2015 UTC,"Scoring isn't an issue for the Lakers, interior defense is. Now Kobe has someone behind him for when he gets blown by semi frequently."
lakers,3c73kb,numbnutsnz,2,Sun Jul 5 21:58:12 2015 UTC,"It sure is. Low risk, potentially high reward. I like it although it sucks the lakers had give up pick. Not a HUGE deal though."
lakers,3c73kb,Musingmike,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"In many aspects he is still a worthwhile starter.  If he can be retained beyond this year as a reasonable price (probably in the 6-11m range i imagine, given the salary cap bump), he would give the Lakers an ok starter at center that provides shot blocking while allowing the big bucks to be spent at other positions to maybe entice a superstar to LA."

lakers,3c80mp,LikeIFuckingCare,2,Sun Jul 5 20:27:00 2015 UTC,Buycks wasn't too bad in the couple games he played for us last year.  I could see him sticking on as our 3rd PG.

lakers,3c80mp,aveydey,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:24:45 2015 UTC,"Sadly it's the one benefit of having a player whose on a 10 - day contract, they are literally playing each game for their lives. I was so bummed when he got his injury and it meant he wouldn't get another 10 - day. Glad he can fight once more for a roster spot. His name isn't too great though lol, but Laker Nation will make up a good nickname with Buycks."
lakers,3c80mp,spudwinkle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:58:46 2015 UTC,Excited to watch Tony Mitchell. Kid can jump out of the building.

lakers,3c92sb,itsadriel,5,Mon Jul 6 01:13:47 2015 UTC,He doesn't mind losing.  As long as he's in the NBA making millions and he's back home in LA  he's content.
lakers,3c92sb,DUBBZZ,14,Mon Jul 6 01:53:18 2015 UTC,"he's not a very good player. Inconsistent scorer who plays no defense. With Lou Will here now, there's no need for Swaggy p."
lakers,3c92sb,MikeMcNorv,12,Mon Jul 6 01:17:05 2015 UTC,Don't forget his attitude.  That's the main reason.
lakers,3c92sb,joelee1711,-8,Mon Jul 6 01:25:09 2015 UTC,"Isn't Lou Williams the same type of player? In fact he seems less efficient than Nick Young. Not a Nick Young fan by any measure, but SF is our weakest position right now"
lakers,3c92sb,mjith,11,Mon Jul 6 01:43:11 2015 UTC,less efficient than Nick Young? what are you talking about man.
lakers,3c92sb,MikeMcNorv,2,Mon Jul 6 01:58:45 2015 UTC,"Shot 40% last two years. I haven't watched him play too much, but the Raptor fans seem to think he is incredibly inconsistent. Hope he thrives from the bench.. 6MOY for a reason i suppose."
lakers,3c92sb,mjith,6,Mon Jul 6 02:12:44 2015 UTC,Nick Young was worse last year.
lakers,3c92sb,MikeMcNorv,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:15:29 2015 UTC,"And nick young shot 36% last year. Never mind all the other shut with ""Swaggy P"""
lakers,3c92sb,fearlesspinata,2,Mon Jul 6 19:11:42 2015 UTC,Williams can play decent defense and shoots at a better clip.
lakers,3c92sb,Dougmartin22,3,Mon Jul 6 01:49:40 2015 UTC,So D'Angelo Russell can go out and ball in his #0 jersey.
lakers,3c92sb,Flagcap,8,Mon Jul 6 03:55:28 2015 UTC,I like Swaggy :|
lakers,3c92sb,AaronOG,4,Mon Jul 6 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"That's the issue, I like Swaggy as a person (or even a character) but not much as a player and since Lou is here well he has become expendable."
lakers,3c92sb,Bromine21,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:35:37 2015 UTC,"Well I really liked him for his performance his first year here, which was phenomenal. I don't think it's just to throw him under the buss for a bad season, a good Swaggy will only make our bench better I believe."
lakers,3c92sb,AaronOG,2,Mon Jul 6 01:41:17 2015 UTC,"That is true that it seems people have turned against him quickly after 1 bad season. I can't say I followed much of the locker room stuff with the Lakers but I think most fans concluded he just didn't take it serious enough, that even though he had nagging injures he felt lackadaisical  and was more concerned with being a celebrity in LA. Again not sure but that is what I have heard."
lakers,3c92sb,Bromine21,2,Mon Jul 6 01:44:30 2015 UTC,"I hope we can keep him and he gets a wake up call. I really thought past season was going to be good for him, he was working hard in the summer and was excited to play with Kobe. He then hurt himself (guarding Kobe) and it was all down hill from there."

lakers,3c92sb,imthatguydavid,0,Mon Jul 6 04:19:52 2015 UTC,He puts more effort into his pre/post game outfits and interviews. He's more focused on being a TMZ headline than a basketball player.
lakers,3c92sb,WOX_69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:21:45 2015 UTC,You're just making general statements. There's no way you know this to be true...
lakers,3c92sb,imthatguydavid,0,Mon Jul 6 04:30:31 2015 UTC,I can see it in how he plays.
lakers,3c92sb,WOX_69,0,Mon Jul 6 05:03:43 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were with him shooting in the gym."
lakers,3c92sb,AaronOG,0,Mon Jul 6 04:36:16 2015 UTC,"He he did he'd be good then, wouldn't he?"
lakers,3c92sb,WOX_69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:04:39 2015 UTC,"He might be a volume shooter in the midrange but he can catch and shoot, drive in the paint, and has a knack for drawing fouls. Don't pretend he's absolute trash."
lakers,3c92sb,AaronOG,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:10:33 2015 UTC,"Lol, he's horrible at driving in the paint and rarely does it at that. He lives off threes and long twos."
lakers,3c92sb,WOX_69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:12:49 2015 UTC,"He was a goofball playing well, and he became a lovable character on the team. His act sorta wore out and he...to me anyways, became a bit annoying."

lakers,3c92sb,WOX_69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:22:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah phenomenol. Seriously, if you didn't like Nick that first year you are going to absoloutly hate Lou Will. Nick is a better player in that 6 man role."
lakers,3c92sb,AaronOG,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:35:54 2015 UTC,"HAHAHAHAHAHA, boy you keep on knocking these jokes out the park man, I love it."
lakers,3c92sb,WOX_69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:04:14 2015 UTC,Swaggy is a mediocre scorer who can't be counted on to consistently do that. Since he doesn't do much else he doesn't serve much purpose. The lakers resigned him because he was a fan favorite and we were gonna tank. Now if we can dump him I say do it
lakers,3c92sb,FreshDiamond,5,Mon Jul 6 02:46:58 2015 UTC,He is a clown
lakers,3c92sb,thelakesh0w,4,Mon Jul 6 01:24:28 2015 UTC,Small man version of Dwight Forward with far less talent.  The Lakers are not the circus.... Thus no clowns allowed.  Good riddance to Young and Iggy
lakers,3c92sb,p0se1d0n,2,Mon Jul 6 01:34:53 2015 UTC,"I want someone who is serious about basketball. He's on a friendly contract, but that loses his value if he can't be a good veteran presence for the rookies. And I don't believe he can come in all season with the proper attitude"
lakers,3c92sb,Laker_Junkie,2,Mon Jul 6 02:38:31 2015 UTC,"Because many are fairweather fans. They loved Swag when he was ballin two years ago. but he has a bad, injury hit season, and is fucking Iggy so all of suddent dudes want him gone  If he shows up to training camp having improved on the things Byron asked him to, I see no reason why they shouldnt keep him"
lakers,3c92sb,NicDwolfwood,2,Mon Jul 6 05:14:33 2015 UTC,I liked him in his first year in LA.  Then I liked him a little less.  He's also strictly worse than Lou Williams. Lou isn't completely nonexistent defensively and he's miles better offensively.
lakers,3c92sb,ashishvp,6,Mon Jul 6 05:46:25 2015 UTC,The fact we refer to him as 'swaggy' says it all...
lakers,3c92sb,locallyunknown,3,Mon Jul 6 01:33:22 2015 UTC,This is the Nick Young I remember. If he plays like this I want to keep him. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IH2Jnf45BI

lakers,3c92sb,FreshDiamond,2,Mon Jul 6 01:30:12 2015 UTC,He isn't good at basketball
lakers,3c92sb,Symphonia1,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:09:55 2015 UTC,He is an ok player. But his attitude and demeanor is the antithesis of Kobe. He's just way too easy going and that doesn't sit well with a fan see who has had killer instinct winners for so many years past.
lakers,3c92sb,WOX_69,0,Mon Jul 6 05:10:32 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, boy you thought wrong.  He's horribly inefficient, horrible defensively, a horrible rebounder and a horrible playmaker."
lakers,3c92sb,TheJusticeCock,0,Mon Jul 6 02:20:17 2015 UTC,Because he's an idiot. I don't want him and his dumbassitute around young impressionable players.

lakers,3c9oxg,_Wi11,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:16:58 2015 UTC,Where did you hear that? I'd love to see that. I can definitely see D'angelo's defense improving just from guarding Swaggy in practice. Swaggy and Kobe are the only ones I ever see trash talking and taking it to other people in practice.

The Spurs have been the NE Patriots of the NBA since they got Duncan, and LBJ is the best player on the planet, likely until The Brow makes the perennial playoff leap. Barkley runs his mouth most of the time, but he's got a pretty solid perspective on players."
lakers,3c7ywt,Markdanielng,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:45:38 2015 UTC,He basically said to watch the Thunder recently.
lakers,3c7ywt,Buckelroo,8,Sun Jul 5 20:39:50 2015 UTC,"I mean, he's not wrong. Hibbert is just going to be a rim protector so we can develop our rookies. He's a role player that we needed, not expecting anything else."
lakers,3c7ywt,shitiwastold,2,Sun Jul 5 19:20:35 2015 UTC,Did anyone here actually read the article? Here is what he said.   It won’t make the Lakers much better
lakers,3c7ywt,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Sun Jul 5 21:45:18 2015 UTC,Barkley seems to have this idea like other Lakers haters that we are trying to compete for a championship lol
lakers,3c7ywt,aveydey,2,Sun Jul 5 22:06:09 2015 UTC,"We could still surprise some folks and make the 8th slot in the playoffs. Lots of roster change ups in the west and a couple teams definitely got worse while we got better, Clippers and Portland for example.  Some playoff teams will include Spurs, Warriors, Houston, Dallas, OKC if Westbrook and Durant are healthy, New Orleans possibly, maybe the Clippers if CP and Blake stay healthy, Memphis for sure... Sacramento could surprise people but I doubt it.  Anyway we have a shot, definitely a dark horse to get swept by Spurs or GSW in the first round."
lakers,3c7ywt,NicDwolfwood,4,Sun Jul 5 20:12:07 2015 UTC,"Being highly optimistic there.   alot of things would need to go right for the Lakers to make the 8th spot. they would have to win atleast 45 games to sneak in as an 8th spot, because thats what it takes in the Western Conference  Byron would have to coach out of his mind, The young players would have to play beyond their years, and Kobe and Hibbert would have to teach these guys how to win."
lakers,3c7ywt,aveydey,2,Sun Jul 5 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"I agree and doubling our win total wont be easy but it can definitely happen.  Celtics and Pelicans managed to sneak in when playoff favorite teams like Sacramento, Phoenix and OKC fell apart."
lakers,3c7ywt,Risar,2,Sun Jul 5 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"I agree and doubling our win total wont be easy    If Kobe and Randle are healthy with the addition of Hibbert and D'Angelo plus Clarkson and Lou Will ... how does anyone think we wont challenge for the playoffs. Honestly. We arent going anywhere past that, but we will be a much improved team over last year."
lakers,3c7ywt,aveydey,2,Sun Jul 5 23:48:23 2015 UTC,Yeah this year Coach actually has a decent roster.  Our losses weren't blowouts either like with D'Antoni... The point differential was usually less than 8 points.  I think the Lakers are going to surprise some folks and r/NBA are going to collectively shit themselves.
lakers,3c7ywt,Roike,2,Mon Jul 6 00:15:11 2015 UTC,"Dude the Lakers had an average point differential of 6.8 last year.  That may not sound bad to people who don't check out stats too much, but, 6.8 is good for 4th worst in the league."
lakers,3c7ywt,Not_Hulk_Hogan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:46:31 2015 UTC,"the fuck did okc, phoenix and sac have to do with the celtics"
lakers,3c7ywt,aveydey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:13:46 2015 UTC,Just another example of a team that snuck into the playoffs when no one expected them to.  And the reason they were able to was because Phoenix sent them IT and he went on a tear in Boston while Phoenix imploded.
lakers,3c7ywt,tmackattak,0,Mon Jul 6 01:16:35 2015 UTC,"Sac and Phoenix were playoff favorites?!  Dude, STAAAAP"
lakers,3c7ywt,aveydey,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:05:24 2015 UTC,Did you watch basketball last season? Sac was a favorite until Boogie got sick and Randive fired Malone.  Team went on a big losing streak then.  Suns were looking good too but then they started making bad trades and the Morris twins got arrested.
lakers,3c7ywt,tmackattak,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:13:26 2015 UTC,"So in your opinion, who did you have Sac and PHX replacing in the playoffs last year?  Do tell!"
lakers,3c7ywt,califan6868,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:37:57 2015 UTC,Hibbert will sure as hell improve our defense if nothing else.

lakers,3c86ga,JamesReach,7,Sun Jul 5 20:24:46 2015 UTC,Good. He only takes up 25 minutes.
lakers,3c86ga,Buckelroo,2,Sun Jul 5 20:36:06 2015 UTC,Can't be worse than swaggy. I hope he doesn't teach them to be selfish though
lakers,3c86ga,Scabandiri,-3,Sun Jul 5 23:58:26 2015 UTC,"Good for Julius Randle (who I consider a rookie) -- there will be plenty of offensive rebounds to fight for. Bad for Russell and 2nd-year Clarkson. Basically a more expensive Nick Young. We don't need 2 Nick Youngs and a Kobe. There's still only one ball to go around next season, right?!"
lakers,3c86ga,misterjay26,-12,Sun Jul 5 23:06:04 2015 UTC,He's great and in 16-17 he will be point for Jordan because Kobe will slide to the 2 to make room for KD to be our new SF :)
lakers,3c86ga,aveydey,7,Sun Jul 5 20:42:03 2015 UTC,And what about Deangelo?
lakers,3c86ga,Prince_Aladeen,2,Sun Jul 5 20:47:15 2015 UTC,"D'Angelo is a point guard, man... What about him? He continues to play the point.  Clarkson moves to the bench to play with Lou and Kobe takes the 2 slot with D'Angelo at 1 and KD at 3.  I am certain this is Mitch and Jim dream scenario they are working towards."
lakers,3c86ga,aveydey,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:15:48 2015 UTC,Ok I miss understood what you were saying. I thought you were saying Lou would start

lakers,3c6gtd,aveydey,7,Sun Jul 5 07:53:48 2015 UTC,"CHOO CHOO! UPSHAW HYPE TRAIN DELIVERING RINGS, RINGS AND MORE RINGS!!"
lakers,3c6gtd,stashtv,11,Sun Jul 5 11:00:18 2015 UTC,"Risk:reward ratio is there.  Let' see him during the summer league, how well he handles the NBA pressures and possibly bulk up."
lakers,3c6gtd,jerkidiot,10,Sun Jul 5 13:05:10 2015 UTC,If he brings the right attitude and keeps away from weed I think he'll be great
lakers,3c6gtd,jayautry,4,Sun Jul 5 13:57:13 2015 UTC,Maybe the weed will help him.
lakers,3c6gtd,Dijamant,2,Sun Jul 5 20:33:30 2015 UTC,Wise words
lakers,3c6gtd,CapnGrundlestamp,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:01:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think weed was his problem, was it?"
lakers,3c6gtd,StuckFern,2,Mon Jul 6 02:04:28 2015 UTC,"I've heard it was weed and cocaine, but I don't think anyone knows for sure."
lakers,3c6gtd,myzticaznfool,34,Mon Jul 6 04:03:41 2015 UTC,you can put stats to fit whatever narrative you want. The fact that he has those stats and went undrafted is more telling tbh
lakers,3c6gtd,StealthRUs,14,Sun Jul 5 09:19:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  People talk about Boogie being a headcase, but Boogie never got kicked off of any team.  Upshaw got kicked off of 2 teams."
lakers,3c6gtd,mister_greyMATTER,4,Sun Jul 5 13:43:44 2015 UTC,"Boogie's a head case for reasons of immaturity, which is something only he can fix himself.    From what I've read, Upshaw's main problem are drugs, which he can easily find help in the forms of coaches, current NBA vets, former players (Bill Walton) and rehab facilities. There haven't been stories from what I've read of Upshaw being a horrible teammate. You can't really compare the two, because they both have different problems."
lakers,3c6gtd,StealthRUs,8,Sun Jul 5 22:09:23 2015 UTC,"Boogies an adult, he's just a kid and he's getting a shot. No way you can not love his pickup. Extremely low risk, super high reward. Let's just hope he pans out."
lakers,3c6gtd,Truesince97,2,Sun Jul 5 15:19:07 2015 UTC,"I agree.  There's no risk to this pick, but there is a reason nobody drafted him.  Hopefully this guy pulls it together and we lucked into the steal of the draft, but people here shouldn't hold their breath.  This guy has major issues."
lakers,3c6gtd,Musingmike,12,Sun Jul 5 21:07:19 2015 UTC,"Man if he pans out, could be a solid hibbert back up who can take over after him!"
lakers,3c6gtd,undercoverbrutha,5,Sun Jul 5 09:03:54 2015 UTC,"Talent is not the issue with Upshaw. I'm amazed people are questioning that. His issue is behavioral. He simply needs to mature and he will be fine. He is very well the future of the center position for the lakers and should be viewed as a steal. The Lakers have some growing pains to deal with, but they are stacked for the future and just need to hope for a major free agent signing in 2016."
lakers,3c6gtd,SlightlyRyan,2,Sun Jul 5 17:04:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly, he needed to go a team with a solid FO and a veteran that can put him in line. We have kobe and a solid FO, we are at no risk giving him a chance"
lakers,3c6gtd,aveydey,29,Sun Jul 5 21:38:04 2015 UTC,"Those guys did it for a full season, against real teams. Look at the teams he put up most of his blocks against, most are barely D1 level schools"
lakers,3c6gtd,SlightlyRyan,10,Sun Jul 5 09:03:50 2015 UTC,He only played in 19 games and still was the #1 shot blocker in the NCAA.
lakers,3c6gtd,Musingmike,4,Sun Jul 5 11:01:02 2015 UTC,"He was the number 1 shot blocker until he stopped playing, he didn't end up the #1."
lakers,3c6gtd,SlightlyRyan,9,Sun Jul 5 17:02:48 2015 UTC,"Oh please. He was a top 100 recruit and only attended Fresno because he recommitted form KSU after a coaching change. He is from Fresno which is why he attended there last minute. His time at Washington was also cut short due to behavioral issues, but he proved his worth. His talent is NOT the issue."
lakers,3c6gtd,jayhawk-420,2,Sun Jul 5 17:03:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's talented, but we don't know how he plays against real players. You can get by in college on height alone when you play teams like San Jose State, Long Beach state, Tulane etc. People are crazy to compare his stats to guys' stats on real teams and think there is anyway they are relevant."
lakers,3c6gtd,SlightlyRyan,3,Sun Jul 5 17:08:28 2015 UTC,"He's obviously pretty good. Even if those aren't top notch teams, he wouldn't be putting up those numbers if he's some scrub"
lakers,3c6gtd,Musingmike,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:25:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely wouldn't call him a scrub. The guys he played against were scrubs. I hope he does well, and I (maybe blind optimism) think he'll be good, but not because of his stat line."
lakers,3c6gtd,SlightlyRyan,-5,Sun Jul 5 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"His stats alone don't mean anything, but I'm saying he is talented regardless of those stats. You aren't paying attention and you also have no business downvoting me. My comment adds to the discussion."
lakers,3c6gtd,lpcfliball246,7,Sun Jul 5 17:11:12 2015 UTC,"First of all, I never downvoted you, second of all, who argues the case that they shouldn't be downvoted."

lakers,3c6gtd,darkshark21,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:44:32 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that nobody that comes from small/not top tier colleges and pans out in the NBA. I'm just saying on top of all his other issues we don't really know how good he is at a top level, even more so for a big man who can get by on that level on size alone. I just think we should set realistic expectations."
lakers,3c6gtd,psychotichorse,10,Sun Jul 5 18:49:41 2015 UTC,Hopefully the Lakers have a good assistant coach to work with him.

lakers,3c6gtd,cellcell,5,Sun Jul 5 20:34:53 2015 UTC,"If he's able to clog the lane, hussel, rebound, and finish at the rim he'll have a place in the NBA. Being a serviceable big in the NBA takes alot of understanding of the game and that's been his greatest question mark. So we'll see what happens."

lakers,3c6gtd,GabrielRodriguez115,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:47:04 2015 UTC,College stats don't mean much to me. Basketball at the professional level is a much more difficult game. College basketball always seemed like Jungle ball to me. So I would reserve my opinion till I see him in a pro game
lakers,3c6gtd,ardyputra027,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:55:31 2015 UTC,Wait how was towns compared here i thought the coach only played him like 20 mins a game?
lakers,3c6gtd,GabrielRodriguez115,4,Sun Jul 5 20:28:35 2015 UTC,"Its the per40 minute stats. They adjusted their stats so that you got the brief example of how their numbers will be if they play for 40 minutes. Even though its not very accurate, it shows you things that they can do if they got a alot of playing time"

lakers,3c574y,DeangeloRussell,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:49:36 2015 UTC,I read a couple seconds rounders and a right to an overseas player.

lakers,3c574y,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,14,Sun Jul 5 01:15:31 2015 UTC,"Clarkson wasn't even our pick; we bought it from Washington. If there's someone we want we have ways of getting a second round pick for cash or a player.  Without Hibbert, our entire starting line-up minus Kobe would be 1st/2nd year players.  We don't need more rookies."
lakers,3c574y,MeridianKnight,2,Sun Jul 5 01:59:46 2015 UTC,"This is a solid point. Randle, Russell, Nance and Brown have played a combined, what, 15 minutes?  We need experienced players to build a form of leadership in the locker room. Hibbert is a decent option given the remainint bigs available. Low risk, high reward if Hibbert gets his game back."
lakers,3c574y,SubtleOstrich,0,Sun Jul 5 02:23:47 2015 UTC,16 minutes. Remember that one game?
lakers,3c574y,readem_n_weep,13,Sun Jul 5 05:30:22 2015 UTC,Who says he's a rental? If he bounces back and plays solid we might be able to sign him for much cheaper.
lakers,3c574y,moserftbl88,13,Sat Jul 4 23:04:30 2015 UTC,Haha that's funny. The lakers sign a free agent. Get out of here.

lakers,3c574y,readem_n_weep,9,Sun Jul 5 05:31:44 2015 UTC,"The reports say cash and 2nd round picks. You can buy 2nd round picks with cash, so it's not a big loss. We actually purchased the 46th pick last year for cash, when we drafted Jordan Clarkson."
lakers,3c574y,egoisillusion,0,Sat Jul 4 22:54:34 2015 UTC,"It's rare for teams to give up picks for cash, and if they do, usually the players aren't that good/or the pick is very low."

lakers,3c574y,Pardonme23,5,Sun Jul 5 01:41:23 2015 UTC,Hibbert has HUGE potential. How is everyone forgetting how big a part he was out in the Pacers when they were leading the East a few years back??
lakers,3c574y,Frangell,7,Sun Jul 5 02:43:22 2015 UTC,"He's 28, at this point I don't think we are going to see anything new from the guy. At 7'2 he's never averaged 10 rebounds in a season which is....concerning. But I'd say he's still got some left in the tank. He's big and experienced. We can work with that."
lakers,3c574y,NattyDread10K,4,Sun Jul 5 04:03:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, but be was extremely good with the Pacers. We'll have to see how things go though. But faith is all we have at the moment."

lakers,3c574y,Frangell,2,Sun Jul 5 10:01:43 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that he cant avg 10 rebounds is that he avg about 20is minute per game.

lakers,3c8b6z,PaperDesk,8,Sun Jul 5 21:16:33 2015 UTC,Thanks Mr. Rodgers.
lakers,3c8b6z,joelee1711,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:41:15 2015 UTC,"He's worrying over something that really, isn't a big deal.  We are nowhere near contention so it's unreasonable to stress over and freak out about an issue, while admittedly a big flaw, an understandable one bc championship aspirations are out of the question."
lakers,3c8b6z,mrbenoit,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:45:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we're just going to have to throw the rookies into the fire. We'll struggle, but hopefully it'll speed up their development."
lakers,3c8b6z,sayheykid24,6,Sun Jul 5 21:42:13 2015 UTC,"This is a very good question, and hopefully it's answered by trading Swaggy P for a defensive specialist."
lakers,3c8b6z,ss3happy1,2,Sun Jul 5 21:37:52 2015 UTC,"we will most likely put Brown on him. Unless we resign Wes. We have no more cap for a good SF anymore (unless they want to take a huge paycut) because of the Lou signing, so we'll just have to ride it out."
lakers,3c8b6z,Akvc8,2,Sun Jul 5 21:12:35 2015 UTC,This is why I make a play for Luc Richard Mbah a Moute for  minimum. Dude is such a solid wing defender..can gird 1-4. Really think he can thrive here as he's not expected to score much and can get boards
lakers,3c8b6z,StealthRUs,3,Mon Jul 6 06:26:21 2015 UTC,"Nobody.  We're going to, again, be a terrible defensive team."
lakers,3c8b6z,StealthRUs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:17:06 2015 UTC,Exactly. Imagine how screwed over we'd be if Hibbert wasn't there too.
lakers,3c8b6z,Edmuresay,-10,Sun Jul 5 21:19:26 2015 UTC,Screwed over?  If anything the Hibbert trade screwed us over. We pick up an extra 2-3 meaningless wins that send our pick to Philly.
lakers,3c8b6z,Risar,10,Sun Jul 5 21:32:34 2015 UTC,"Tanking with a top 5 protected pick was hard enough... It's not gonna happen with a top 3 protected. Let that shit go, that pick is going to Philly. Hell it has a good shot going to Philly even if the Lakers finish bottom 3. Time to build positive development habits and not perpetuate the bullshit losing culture that begins to happen once you tank enough."
lakers,3c8b6z,lars5,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:51:12 2015 UTC,"Better, who the hell do we want out of next years draft ? All the ""franchise"" bigs went this year. You need a vet at some point to drive the young guys to the next level. Kobe might be that, but more likely is someone after Kobe retires.  Think Igodoula for GS."
lakers,3c8b6z,hman9294,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:44:34 2015 UTC,"Funnel into Hibbert, hope for a blocked shot."
lakers,3c8b6z,harleyhjc,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:28:01 2015 UTC,"This is exactly my main concern. Kobe can guard, but he needs help.   We have to hope that Mitch has one more trick up his sleeve. Hopefully turning Nick Young into Wilson Chandler? I have a feeling we're going to be stuck with Wes however."
lakers,3c8b6z,IMjudas,0,Sun Jul 5 21:10:24 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how Wes isn't an elite defender. Last time I checked he was long, outrageously athletic, and at least above average in lateral quickness. Can we resign him and tell him no more shots outside of the paint, just get steals and we'll let you dunk the ball sometimes??"
lakers,3c8z2k,blackbeardboyband,2,Mon Jul 6 00:39:40 2015 UTC,I think it's still in the works.
lakers,3c8z2k,TimeisIllmatic95,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:17:45 2015 UTC,Is there an idea of the framework?

lakers,3c7efd,LittleToke,7,Sun Jul 5 16:10:17 2015 UTC,this team needs a good defender at the SF position someone like danny green would have been perfect   and 3 point shooters off the bench   brandon bass and lou are still available
lakers,3c7efd,kemar7856,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:05:48 2015 UTC,I say just let Brown have a chance. If he can defend and be semi consistent from 3 he could be really valuable to us. Totally agree though. Must have a 3 and D guy.
lakers,3c7efd,RichyRoach,3,Sun Jul 5 20:06:36 2015 UTC,I'm hoping we get Gerald Green of the SF position then we'll have a solid team or even chandlers
lakers,3c7efd,ILikeChocolateMilkk,2,Sun Jul 5 16:16:23 2015 UTC,Gerald Green/Miles Plumlee would be nice pickups to add support
lakers,3c7efd,hitmanrva10,2,Sun Jul 5 18:57:10 2015 UTC,Im even ok with Josh Smith as long as we don't over pay him
lakers,3c7efd,nigg_a,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:20:40 2015 UTC,We need a SF really bad. We don't have anyone.
lakers,3c7efd,RonaldCharles,2,Sun Jul 5 21:08:08 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Sacre. He's going to get some minutes this season. Also, I'd like to see Tarik Black play some power-foward next season. He said during his interview that he sees himself as more of a 4, and he's been putting some work in his mid range jumper.  Edit: I also see us holding onto Dwight Buycks and/or Vander Blue to give us some more depth."
lakers,3c7efd,Buckelroo,2,Sun Jul 5 17:05:01 2015 UTC,I'd like to see Clarkson and Russell play as many minutes as possible so I would start them in the backcourt.  Kobe and Swaggy P should share the minutes at 3.  Randle at 4 and Hibbert at 5.
lakers,3c7efd,iamnedsmanks,3,Sun Jul 5 18:13:53 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with what you're saying.  Let those two young guys get as many minutes as possible, and Kobe/Swag share the 4.  Anyone know if we're keeping Boozer?"
lakers,3c7efd,hitmanrva10,2,Sun Jul 5 18:56:05 2015 UTC,Definitely like that backcourt. A lot of athleticism and you want them to learn to play together going forward.

lakers,3c7efd,Theingloriousak2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:44:12 2015 UTC,Honestly if upshaw pans out the way we belive in the defensive end and russell/clarkson backcourt duo is amazing as it sounds we could possible contend for the playoffs next year with a proven squad and maybe sign the need free agent to take us to the playoffs but we lack a sf right now and i think gerald green or even josh smith would help us alot in that department
lakers,3c7efd,nigg_a,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:22:48 2015 UTC,"While just the right signing may change things, OKC, Phoenix and Utah are all still better than the Lakers - no playoffs."
lakers,3c7efd,iamnedsmanks,2,Sun Jul 5 19:38:45 2015 UTC,Plus the only team I see dropping out of the top 8 is the Blazers. Also I think a young man named Anthony Davis will have something to say.
lakers,3c7efd,RichyRoach,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:05:04 2015 UTC,"Clarkson, Kobe, SF, Randle, Hibbert with Russell coming off the bench for the beginning of the year. Eventually it'll be Russell, Clarkson, Kobe, Randle, Hibbert."

lakers,3c7efd,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:48:50 2015 UTC,the Lou Williams deal kind of fucked our cap space. He's a fine player but really awkward for our team.   We basically have 2 SF. Anthony Brown and Swaggy. It would be pretty cool to see if Mitch can work a few trades and get Wilson Chandler on his expiring contract.
lakers,3c7efd,ashishvp,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:24:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly unlike some folks I do see Kobe logging a lot of minutes at the elbow and mid-post. It requires less speed/athleticism than a pure 2 play, and its what other aging swing players have done over the years. People forget Kobe got to play with NVE, Shaw and Harper later in their careers and likely picked up some tricks.  Starting lineup PG: Clarkson SG: Kobe SF: Swaggy ? PF: Randle or LNJ ? C: Hibbert  Small ball, which right now seems likely: PG: DLoading SG: Clarkson SF: Kobe PF: LNJ C: Randle"
lakers,3c7efd,Risar,2,Sun Jul 5 23:53:35 2015 UTC,Kobes playing the 3 or at least starting at the 3.  Clarkson  Russell  Kobe  Randle  Hubert
lakers,3c7efd,Umgator,14,Sun Jul 5 16:19:28 2015 UTC,Hubert
lakers,3c7efd,psilocybin11,-1,Sun Jul 5 17:40:18 2015 UTC,People assume Kobes playing the 3 and Lakers starting both Clarkson and Russell. Kobe can't play the 3 at this age...  It's too demanding on the body and Clarkson is not starter material in the NBA. He'll be a back up to Russell. Sorry for saying the truth.
lakers,3c7efd,babajafar,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:44:20 2015 UTC,At this stage Kobe is probably going to be just as effective playing the 2 or 3. It makes more sense to give Clarkson and Russell the minutes.
lakers,3c7efd,iamnedsmanks,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:41:46 2015 UTC,Clarkson is not starter material in NBA but an unproven rookie is?
lakers,3c7efd,DionisioGameArt,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:49:26 2015 UTC,You are comparing a 2nd round pick to the #2 overall pick. Russell is a better player and this season will show that.
lakers,3c7efd,babajafar,4,Sun Jul 5 19:00:56 2015 UTC,It could also be said as an All-Rookie guard compared to an unproven rookie.
lakers,3c9hqe,saskenasy,5,Mon Jul 6 03:34:52 2015 UTC,"I think these are great additions to the team. The Lakers added a rim protector, a solid rotational big man with a good mid-range, and an instant offense guy off the bench. I think keeping Young would be nice, no matter how unpopular the opinion, but losing him won't hurt too much. It'd be great if the Lakers manage to pull something off with Dallas for Lin. If they can unload both Lin and Young and land a SF who's 3&D, I think we have a really good chance of competing for a playoff spot next year."
lakers,3c9hqe,CoolScales,2,Mon Jul 6 04:28:07 2015 UTC,"I doubt the Mavs would let him go, but if we somehow landed Justin Anderson that would be awesome. I agree with what you said about the new pieces too, solid additions who will instantly help"
lakers,3c9hqe,CoolScales,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:31:49 2015 UTC,"I think we'll probably turn Lin into a second round pick, some cash, and probably a big man since they have two good ones now. I'm seeing Greg Smith more than likely. Not great, but not awful"
lakers,3c9hqe,StealthRUs,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:35:34 2015 UTC,We won 21 games last year.  We have no chance at competing for a playoff spot next year.  Who are we leapfrogging?  New Orleans?  OKC?  Phoenix?
lakers,3c9hqe,CoolScales,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:02:54 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say we have no chance. Let's say it takes 47 games to make the playoffs this year. That's an increase of 26 wins. The Lakers turned Jordan Hill into Roy Hibbert. Although Hibbert isn't the greatest Center, if he can come close to replicating how he played just two years ago, we have a dominant inside presence. In Lou and Bass, the Lakers added two scorers.   Also, the Lakers have one of the strongest benches in the league now. You have Clarkson, who had a great rookie season, and is going to build on how he played last year. You have Lou, who was a sixth man of the year for his scoring off the bench. You have a rotation of big men in Tarik Black and Robert Upshaw, two guys who know their job is to protect the rim. You have Anthony Brown, who I think will be the next Landry Fields when Landry was in NY. And finally, you have Brandon Bass, a knockdown medium range shooter who's still only 29, yet has a ton of experience.   If the Lakers can add one starting caliber SF, I think they have a legitimate shot. They have a good starting lineup, and a great bench. Can they win 26 more games? I'm not sure. But out players, unlike any other in the league have something real to prove. Literally every guy on the team has something to prove. I think if they gel the right way, and play to each other's strengths, this can be a borderline playoff team."
lakers,3c9hqe,StealthRUs,0,Mon Jul 6 14:40:26 2015 UTC,"If he can come close to replicating how he played just two years ago, we have a dominant inside presence.   If he were capable of that, Indiana wouldn't have traded him for a couple of second round picks.  He's clearly no longer capable of that, so turning back the clock isn't something you can factor in.    Also, the Lakers have one of the strongest benches in the league now.    Stop being such a homer.  This isn't remotely true.     You have Lou, who was a sixth man of the year for his scoring off the bench.   But we lose Lin, who is a better scorer and passer than Lou.     You have a rotation of big men in Tarik Black and Robert Upshaw   Both, largely,  unproven.  A lot of people here are hyped about Upshaw, but he went undrafted for a reason.  If he turns into the next Hassan Whiteside, that's great, but the overwhelming odds are he'll be another Ebanks or Caracter.     If the Lakers can add one starting caliber SF, I think they have a legitimate shot. They have a good starting lineup, and a great bench.   We have a mediocre-to-bad starting lineup and we have a good but not great bench with Bass, Clarkson/Russell, Black, and Williams.     Can they win 26 more games?    No.  Absolutely not.  A move like that requires getting 2 A-list guys.  There's no other way.  Bass, Williams, and Hibbert probably net us an extra 12 wins, at the absolute very best, but more likely they'll give us an extra 8-9 wins.     But out players, unlike any other in the league have something real to prove. Literally every guy on the team has something to prove.   Lou Williams and Roy Hibbert will be 29 next season and Bass will be 30.  Those guys are who they are - average NBA guys.  They don't have anything to prove.     Russell, Clarkson, Randle, Nance, Upshaw and Black have a lot to prove, but you could say the same thing about Philly's young guys, Utah's young guys, Orlando's young guys, or Minnesota's young guys.     I think if they gel the right way, and play to each other's strengths, this can be a borderline playoff team.   You're being a Lakers homer and not looking at the situation objectively.  You're also not factoring in that we have an awful coach.  Even if we had the talent to be a # 8 seed if everything broke the right way, B. Scott isn't the guy that's going to maximize that talent."

lakers,3c9hqe,DJyoungHeisenberg,2,Mon Jul 6 04:44:40 2015 UTC,He did good for us under mike  d antoni. What guard doesn't have a great year under him. There is a reason he played for a million bucks. There wasn't much of a market for him. He is a decent scorer that brings nothing else but inconsistency and a giant ego

Anderson's salary on its own won't be able enough for them to sign Lin at market value.  Adding Anderson to the equation would only serve to make Lin's salary higher, there's no need to sacrifice a rookie they like to do that when they can just throw in future picks and cash.    I'd love Anderson, but I highly doubt they'd give him up to pay Lin a little bit extra"
lakers,3c8dng,_im_on_acid_,2,Mon Jul 6 02:28:24 2015 UTC,"Well, if the Lakers are taking back Felton, they aren't gonna pull the trigger on the deal. The Mavs would have to send someone, or something else to entice the Lakers to pull the trigger, especially after signing Lou."

lakers,3c5378,howdoesilogin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:19:58 2015 UTC,The only reason Indiana gave him up is cap space. After signing Monta they were basically capped and now they can get other guys instead and play Mahimi at C (whos actually pretty good)
lakers,3c5378,joelee1711,22,Sun Jul 5 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"I'm worried that Hibbert's anxiety and performance issues will only worsen when playing with Kobe.  I don't think Hibbert is the guy that can mentally take how demanding Kobe is...i think the mamba will make him cry lol.  Can you imagine what Kobe will say when Hibbert gets less than 5 rebounds in back to back games?  Other than that, this is a decent pick up.  Helps our defense, but I wish we got an asset back.  Hibbert isn't very mobile and wont go well with what Russell and Clarkson do best."
lakers,3c5378,TuneHD,17,Sat Jul 4 22:36:05 2015 UTC,"I think Kobe is good at pushing people to be tougher, which is Hibbert's main knock. It only doesn't work with scrubs (Smush) and guys who have egos but have maturity issues (Howard). Hibbert knows his role and won't have a big head like Howard."
lakers,3c5378,gotdorkie,26,Sat Jul 4 22:50:16 2015 UTC,Kobe is going to break Hibbert.
lakers,3c5378,TuneHD,12,Sat Jul 4 23:36:03 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but I think Kobe might be able to push Hibbert to be strong just like West did. I don't think Hibbert is weak-minded in the sense that if you push him he'll break down. I think it's more like he needs somebody to keep him tough."
lakers,3c5378,bobbybrahhh,2,Sat Jul 4 23:55:24 2015 UTC,"Break him down and build him up, if you will?"
lakers,3c5378,fem3n3,9,Sun Jul 5 07:10:57 2015 UTC,He is going to break the thin glass thread that is hibberts confidence.

lakers,3c5378,Camus145,54,Sat Jul 4 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"As a Pacers fan, take care of my boy Hibbert. He has underachieved recently and he is a total choke artist, but he's a good guy and he's a gigantic human being who knows how to protect the rim. I think Hibbert makes a ton of sense on your team. He's one of the best rim protectors in the league, and I think he was key to the Pacers elite defense over the past 5 years or so."
lakers,3c5378,RyanLaFalce,19,Sat Jul 4 21:51:15 2015 UTC,"And hopefully you guys take Nick Young. Also, hopefully Paul George is a beast next season."
lakers,3c5378,Sharkytowers,2,Sat Jul 4 21:55:51 2015 UTC,Appreciate it man.  I'm cautiously optimistic about Hibbert.  A one-year flyer on him has salvaged what has otherwise been a disappointing FA period to say the least.    Enjoy getting Paul George back my friend!
lakers,3c5378,itsyourdestini,26,Sun Jul 5 16:57:07 2015 UTC,BEST CENTER IN LA
lakers,3c5378,lars5,6,Sat Jul 4 22:41:48 2015 UTC,lol that's true isn't it.
lakers,3c5378,how_u_like_meow,3,Sun Jul 5 01:59:50 2015 UTC,He's no hype man like Sacre but he's officially the top center for ALL Los Angeles teams...looking at you Clippers.
lakers,3c5378,hibby_,3,Sun Jul 5 03:05:34 2015 UTC,Hibbert vs. JaVale in the LA derby. What a time to be alive
lakers,3c5378,vandiger,23,Sun Jul 5 09:53:48 2015 UTC,Mitch did it!!! Saved our offseason getting a true center. Happy 4th of July!!!!!!!!

lakers,3c5378,SkipBroussard,-21,Sat Jul 4 21:37:58 2015 UTC,i actually think we should add david lee now too. hibbert can offset lee's defense.
lakers,3c5378,DeangeloRussell,44,Sat Jul 4 21:43:20 2015 UTC,Why take minutes away from randle?
lakers,3c5378,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,21,Sat Jul 4 21:50:38 2015 UTC,So we can keep the competition guessing duh!
lakers,3c5378,Notalent13,4,Sat Jul 4 21:58:42 2015 UTC,"Why actually play Lee as anything else but a reserve?  That said, it doesn't matter, Hibbert is expensive enough that I don't think we can get Lee unless we trade Nick Young, and I don't think the Warriors are willing to accept any salary in return, they simply want to dump money."
lakers,3c5378,aveydey,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:02:12 2015 UTC,If we're going to get Lee might as well just keep Boozer instead.
lakers,3c5378,RolloJTomasi,8,Sat Jul 4 22:59:30 2015 UTC,"Nah, man. 7'2 defensive Hibbert is nearly a good a front court match for Randle as there is out there. Randle's knock is his defensive aptitude, Hibbert helps cover his weakness."
lakers,3c5378,byrnesf,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:54:40 2015 UTC,David Lee is making 15 mil. Hibbert is making 15 mil. Kobe is making 25 mil. SwaggyP is making 5 mil. That's 60 mil right there...
lakers,3c5378,bombchron,19,Sat Jul 4 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"Calling it right now; Hibbert is going to have a solid year on both sides of the floor. He has been thrashed by the media in the last couples years for being unproductive and this year he is playing for a contract. He is a headcase who gets down on himself very easily, but the Lakers current situation is extremely low pressure."
lakers,3c5378,XC_Stallion92,54,Sun Jul 5 04:08:17 2015 UTC,"Lakers fans and Pacers fans are already chill with each other, so I'm pretty stoked about him going to you guys. Hope you guys can turn him around. He's still skilled, he just got really lazy and unmotivated and wore out his welcome in Indy."
lakers,3c5378,DeangeloRussell,32,Sat Jul 4 22:09:21 2015 UTC,Wish you guys beat the heat one of those years
lakers,3c5378,valiumandbeer,15,Sat Jul 4 21:59:09 2015 UTC,remember the Lebron layup to win the game when Hibbert was on the bench? that would have been so different if he was in the game...
lakers,3c5378,teo1315,4,Sat Jul 4 22:00:51 2015 UTC,Not many guys make Lebron second guess a layup.  Roy is one of those guys.
lakers,3c5378,XC_Stallion92,18,Sat Jul 4 22:59:54 2015 UTC,Yeah don't we all.
lakers,3c5378,bobbybrahhh,2,Sun Jul 5 10:44:25 2015 UTC,"Oh god I was pulling for them so hard during the ECF when they threw punches with the Heat and took em to the wire. The team that most people slept on all that year, taking the juggernaut Heat team to 7."
lakers,3c5378,Dmanning2,65,Sat Jul 4 22:17:24 2015 UTC,Hibbert for 1 year > Robin Lopez for 54mil

lakers,3c5378,CalmerThanYouAreDood,7,Sat Jul 4 22:26:06 2015 UTC,Long term cap flexibility
lakers,3c5378,spudwinkle,7,Sat Jul 4 22:57:06 2015 UTC,"I agree - test out Hibbert, and if it works great, re-sign. If not, we can let him go. I wouldn't want to be stuck with a Lopez brother longer than 3 years for 54m anyway."
lakers,3c5378,TheJucheisLoose,4,Sun Jul 5 02:21:31 2015 UTC,"""and how"" is an expression of agreement, not asking how."
lakers,3c5378,Theingloriousak2,16,Sun Jul 5 02:32:06 2015 UTC,Just got a 28 year old center who was misused by his previous team and showed that he can be really good on both sides of the court  On a 1 year deal so if he doesn't come through we are good  We just need a sf

lakers,3c5378,NattyDread10K,8,Sun Jul 5 01:59:11 2015 UTC,Hopefully a few assets to come with it as well along with a player who can hopefully turn it around.
lakers,3c5378,raofblow290,6,Sat Jul 4 21:36:43 2015 UTC,Big and experienced presence in the middle. It's something. Maybe last season was a fluke and he can be decent again.
lakers,3c5378,untouchedURL,5,Sat Jul 4 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"This is fucking awesome news actually. Although Hibbert has sucked the past year offensively, he is still an elite defender."

lakers,3c5378,clippjoint,6,Sat Jul 4 22:56:54 2015 UTC,We got one boys! WE BACK!
lakers,3c5378,WOX_69,4,Sat Jul 4 21:37:27 2015 UTC,"""Teams only shot 42.6% at the rim against Hibbert last year. That’s an elite level of rim protection."""
lakers,3c5378,_Meece_,24,Sat Jul 4 21:56:06 2015 UTC,"PLEASE LET US SEND OUT NICK YOUNG, PLEASE."
lakers,3c5378,WOX_69,5,Sun Jul 5 02:51:08 2015 UTC,"Wait until the trade deadline mate. His shooting production went well south last year, let him get back to being the usual efficient 3pt shooter he is so his value is higher."
lakers,3c5378,_Meece_,2,Sat Jul 4 21:53:02 2015 UTC,"He's only been forty percent shooter twice in his career, his first and third seasons. I fear if we wait any longer his value will just continue to sink. His shooting production is on par with his career."
lakers,3c5378,WOX_69,6,Sat Jul 4 23:02:01 2015 UTC,"Nah not last year, not at all. He was really bad last year. I'm sure that hand surgery had something to do with it. I don't think he'll be that bad again.  He only needs to be at 37-40% from 3 to be an efficient shooter. That's all I want from him this year, because we can get some good value out of that from playoff teams looking for a wing shooter."
lakers,3c5378,_Meece_,-1,Sat Jul 4 23:14:27 2015 UTC,"The problem is he isn't a spot up shooter, so he'd disrupt anyone's offense with his classic dribble out the clock chuck up a three move.  I just really hope we can dupe someone into taking him."
lakers,3c5378,WOX_69,5,Sat Jul 4 23:18:23 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much freedom he's given. He's mostly been on bad teams, where he's been forced to be a main offensive option.  He's a pretty iffy off ball player, no doubt. But he can spot up shoot when needed, like he did with the Clips not that long ago.  Definitely gonna have to dupe someone in to getting him."
lakers,3c5378,justgivingsomeadvice,-1,Sat Jul 4 23:20:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even say he was forced into being the main offensive option. With the Wizards he was coming off the bench, same with the Clippers and Philly. He went to the playoffs once with the Wizards, and his one half season with the Clippers. They proceeded to no re-sign him and picked up Crawford. Philly picked him up when they were rebuilding with Collins and then let him go. I think it speaks a lot to him as a player, especially that we were able to (Unfortunately) re-sign him twice. No one's beating down the door for him."
lakers,3c5378,WOX_69,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:22:11 2015 UTC,I remember thinking he's actually an excellent spotup shooter (or was in 2013-2014) but yeah he loves taking really stupid pullup 3s
lakers,3c5378,spudwinkle,-2,Sat Jul 4 23:33:01 2015 UTC,I'd hold off on calling him excellent.
lakers,3c5378,WOX_69,2,Sun Jul 5 01:18:39 2015 UTC,"That particular season (13-14) he was splashing it more than others though so he was definitely not bad - just his last season was so terrible everyone is ready to show him the door. I want him to stay one more season and reinvent himself with the young core, and now Big Hibb."
lakers,3c5378,logicatch,-3,Sun Jul 5 01:49:30 2015 UTC,"He's not shot forty-five percent from the field, the lowest end of of good for a wing player. Plus he defense, rebounding and playmaking were still just as atrocious as ever. This is who he is. He's not young (No pun), he's thirty years old. He's not going to reinvent himself. He's still the same below average player that he's always been.  People that were in the know knew he was a bad signing when we signed him in the 2013 off-season."
lakers,3c5378,Lyqu1d,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:52:43 2015 UTC,Hopefully Russell will get him some good looks so he can increase that FG% and boost his value.

lakers,3c5378,WOX_69,0,Sat Jul 4 23:47:37 2015 UTC,Won't someone think of the  children!!!!!!!!!
lakers,3c5378,JeremyDolphin,9,Sat Jul 4 22:11:29 2015 UTC,"He's not even that bad, you can't judge him based on his injury plagued season where we happened to be tanking."
lakers,3c5378,WOX_69,11,Sun Jul 5 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"Oh you mean the guy that's ALWAYS an incredibly inefficient ""scorer"" been a horrendous defender, terrible rebounder, a terrible playmaker (More career turnovers than assists) who puts more time into his pre/post game outfits, interviews and being a TMZ headline is ""not even that bad""?  What Nick Young was last year is the same player he's always been. He's garbage."
lakers,3c5378,JeremyDolphin,8,Sat Jul 4 22:16:22 2015 UTC,That's not fair. Nick had a bad year but he does bring value to the team when put in the right role. He has great energy off the bench and was the only guy before clarkson came on that could actually create his own shot.
lakers,3c5378,WOX_69,-2,Sat Jul 4 22:19:49 2015 UTC,"You understand that for he's career he's ALWAYS been inefficient, horrible on defense, a terrible rebounder for his size, and a terrible playmaker, right? He averages more career turnovers than assists."
lakers,3c5378,TracerBullet11,4,Sat Jul 4 23:42:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do. I'm simply pointing out that some of the inefficiency that is reflected in his stats is a result of the fact that he was the guy they threw the ball to with 4 seconds left on the shot clock."
lakers,3c5378,WOX_69,-2,Sat Jul 4 23:46:37 2015 UTC,Almost a majority of the time he got the ball with more than enough time on the clock to make something happened and he dribbled it out.
lakers,3c5378,raofblow290,0,Sun Jul 5 00:02:08 2015 UTC,This is why I stopped coming on this sub. How the fuck is anyone defending Nick Young's inefficiency
lakers,3c5378,WOX_69,-3,Sun Jul 5 00:04:39 2015 UTC,I just don't get it at all. It makes no sense whatsoever.
lakers,3c5378,kemar7856,2,Sun Jul 5 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"seriously, and he gave up on defense on a bunch of plays last season. he is not a true Laker and doesn't play like one."
lakers,3c5378,valiumandbeer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:30:34 2015 UTC,Exactly why I want this dude off this team.

lakers,3c5378,StarKiller66,0,Sat Jul 4 22:55:46 2015 UTC,he actually is.
lakers,3c5378,tree_D,7,Sat Jul 4 22:17:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly I like it. We need a big body to just be in the paint defensively. We aren't really counting on much offensive production from our 5 anyways given our lineup. We got dynamic young guards, an undersized versatile 4 in Randle, and Kobe who can still score. Hopefully we also picked up a couple other young players from the Pacers. Now let's just try and pick up a young 2/3 to a 1 year deal."
lakers,3c5378,mistersabs,7,Sat Jul 4 23:00:55 2015 UTC,Is it weird I always kinda thought he would end up a Laker?

lakers,3c5378,mcorcoran3,-5,Sun Jul 5 14:20:47 2015 UTC,Through a trade. That isn't good news. That means the lakers possibly wasted draft picks for a guy who possibly won't even be on the roster after next year which should be all about developing youth. This isn't anything to be excited over.

We are sending a second round pick and rights to international players when we should be receiving a pick in return for absorbing his salary. He's already on the decline at age 28 - this has Andrew Bynum written all over it. Hibbert has the yips. He's not going to be a franchise center and can sign with any team he wants next year.  Edit: He's never even shot 50% from the field. 10/7 last year on 44% shooting. 40th in the league in rebounding.

lakers,3c5378,GoingBackToMyWays,-4,Sun Jul 5 00:16:06 2015 UTC,There's a reason he got benched in Indiana...he's too slow to play in the modern NBA.  We will get murdered on the PNR and probably give up the most 3s in the NBA.  Still...not opposed to the signing.  His salary comes off the books after this year and it'll help us tank for our top 3 draft pick.  edit: Holy shit!  We gave up a 2nd round pick?!?!  Oh wtf.
lakers,3c5378,GOATLin,9,Sat Jul 4 23:20:59 2015 UTC,We got him essentially for nothing. A position we desperately needed. And a 1 year rental on what was once a very good defender? You guys need to be happy and celebrate. It's a win-win.

lakers,3c5378,GoingBackToMyWays,-1,Sun Jul 5 02:20:21 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of good players who were 2nd round picks.  Not about Lin as he was undrafted.  It's just stupid IMO for us to give up a draft pick to take on a salary dump.  Indiana didn't want him, had already said he wasn't going to play much, and yet we gave up an asset for him?  Doubt there were many teams looking to take on $15 million in salary for Hibbert."
lakers,3c5378,aveydey,5,Sun Jul 5 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"If you had a chance to draft a Hibbert in the second round many people would consider it a steal of the draft. At the end of the day Hibbert is a top rim protector, and if he applies himself is a legit starter in the league. If he plays good, we have our starting center for the next few years. I don't see why anyone would not be happy with this."
lakers,3c5378,ProdigalReality,-1,Sun Jul 5 02:45:12 2015 UTC,Drafting a Hibbert lets you keep him on a rookie scale.  We're getting a one year rental at 15 million.  The cap space isn't an issue but if he plays well we have to pay him on a new contract anyways.  Maybe that works because we can wait until we sign other guys then go over the cap to sign Hibbert.  But personally I don't think he's that good anymore.
lakers,3c5378,GOATLin,3,Sun Jul 5 02:47:37 2015 UTC,"So then why not start upshaw? He'll be  on a rookie scale, has skills comparable to Hibbert, by your logic upshaw would be better to have than Hibbert, correct?"

lakers,3c5378,GOATLin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:43:44 2015 UTC,"Well, because it's us making the draft picks, and it's our team developing these players.  Van Exel was the last 2nd rounder to actually be an everyday starter for this team. Drafted in 93.  Hell, only Marc Gasol and Patrick Beverley are the other two players who are even worth a shit.  That's 3 players through 22 years of 2nd round picks. 24 total 2nd round picks.  1/3 of 2nd round picks never even play in the NBA. Those that do get to play a game, only 50% actually make it past their 2nd year.  Average career length is 2.7 years. If you take out those who never play a single minute, it's 3.8.  The last 10 drafts, only two 2nd round picks made an all-star game."

lakers,3c5378,clippjoint,2,Sun Jul 5 09:46:42 2015 UTC,"2nd round picks aren't that valuable in the long run. They have a low rate of success. You don't lose anything by giving them up.

lakers,3c5378,GOATLin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:51:00 2015 UTC,"This is why our team is going into the toilet.  Our FO clearly thinks the same way you do.  Elsewhere, teams like Houston, San Antonio, etc do what they can to grab 2nd round picks on the cheap and avoid giving theirs away unless it's to get a better asset.  2nd round picks are cheap.  You can try and develop them every year and not lose a roster spot or much cap space.  Giving them away is shortsighted and just dumb basketball wise.  Especially for a 1 year rental."

lakers,3c8ns7,FreshDiamond,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:04:39 2015 UTC,He isnt that good but made it to the league... Gilbert was a beast and still could of flourished in the league but we all know what happened to him. Nick young does what hes paid to do by teams and that is score. Sure he can be inconsistent but hes no joke of a player. Ask any nba player thats played against him or with him. Javaris Critteton was terrible though thats unanimous.
lakers,3c8ns7,chaseeast,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:10:31 2015 UTC,I think we are all mature enough to understand when someone says an NBA player isn't good that means BY NBA STANDARDS. He doesn't score consistently. Everyone has off nights but you can count on Jamal Crawford to give you 15-20 points every night. He occasionally will miss those numbers but you feel comfortable outrun him in that role. Nick young can not be counted and at this point we don't need him. He is the least valuable guard on the our roster at the moment so bye nick.

lakers,3c5jmb,aveydey,16,Sun Jul 5 16:27:52 2015 UTC,I can see this being our rotation / depth chart  PG - D'Angelo Russell / Jordan Clarkson  SG - Jordan Clarkson / Kobe / Jabari Brown   SF - Kobe / Nick Young / Anthony Brown  PF - Julius Randle / Tarik Black / Larry Nance Jr  C  - Roy Hibbert / Robert Upshaw / Bob Shaqre
lakers,3c5jmb,Schneeky,20,Sun Jul 5 02:22:48 2015 UTC,"""Bob Shaqre"" ;)"
lakers,3c5jmb,clippjoint,2,Sun Jul 5 02:53:24 2015 UTC,Made me chuckle.
lakers,3c5jmb,ObliviousIrrelevance,5,Sun Jul 5 18:06:02 2015 UTC,"I don't see Clarkson starting, and frankly I'd rather he come off the bench. He'll still get 30 plus mins/gm. We'll need all the bench production we can get. It is possible that Russell will not immediately start though.  I think Anthony Brown will start by earning it this summer. He's a great defender, exactly what we'll want as a starter. Kobe can't be guarding 3's all season.   Russell - Kobe - brown - Randle - Hibbert   That's a decent defensive line up. That should be our game plan; focusing on D and letting it turn into offense. And offensively, Kobe and Randle will be options 1 and 2 in the post mostly (Kobe most effective there now against opposing 2 guards and will create mismatches if they send a forward on him inside). Russell and brown options 3 and 4 on the wing (kickout). Hibbert there to clean it up and create screens for Russell."
lakers,3c5jmb,Reply_Hazy,0,Sun Jul 5 05:20:18 2015 UTC,Could we possibly sneak into the 8th seed?
lakers,3c5jmb,RyanLaFalce,16,Sun Jul 5 02:30:51 2015 UTC,Ehhhhh no. Unless the rooks are LEGENDARY. They gotta perform as well as Wiggins did last year.  But we COULD be a .500 team. I wouldn't mind a 40 win season.   As long as we don't tank. I wanna watch some fun games this year. I'm not gonna bother if we're tanking.
lakers,3c5jmb,ashishvp,3,Sun Jul 5 03:03:48 2015 UTC,Woj just said on FS1 we'd be a lottery team. I hope not unless there's a can't miss second coming of LeBron Shaq jr. Lol
lakers,3c5jmb,RyanLaFalce,9,Sun Jul 5 03:18:24 2015 UTC,Lottery team just means missing the playoffs. Everyone thinks we're a lottery team. I think we're a lottery team.   But I still think we can get 40 wins. Fuck the draft pick. Philly needs it more than we do. Their starting 5 is all centers.
lakers,3c5jmb,ashishvp,2,Sun Jul 5 03:53:24 2015 UTC,".500 is tough. Unless something major happens during the rest of FA - but based on the remaining FA and assets for possible trades - we likely won't be doing so well next year. The West is too tough, not to mention we are in the Pacific, so we got to play Warriors, Suns, Kings, Clippers a lot throughout the year. Not going to lie - I don't think we can really beat any of them."
lakers,3c5jmb,ss3happy1,2,Sun Jul 5 06:23:30 2015 UTC,"But honestly, who can we actually say we're better than? The Knicks and Sixers? T-Wolves? I don't think any other team can be fairly put behind us right now."
lakers,3c5jmb,jhueckel,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:25:31 2015 UTC,I'd proly put the Blazers behind us. They have Dame but the rest of the team exploded. Reminds me of what Kobe went through back in 2005.
lakers,3c5jmb,ashishvp,5,Sun Jul 5 10:59:34 2015 UTC,Idk... but we must BELIEVE in our Lakers no matter what
lakers,3c5jmb,Schneeky,2,Sun Jul 5 02:35:29 2015 UTC,Oh I believe and hope it'll happen. Especially with a starting 5 of 2 established veterans and 3 young guns.
lakers,3c5jmb,RyanLaFalce,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:49:00 2015 UTC,Unless Russel transforms into something crazy that can carry a team then I can see us get to the 8th seed.
lakers,3c5jmb,FuriousFlex,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:48:33 2015 UTC,"In the east we would, probably not in the west though."
lakers,3c5jmb,VerneTroyersDick,6,Sun Jul 5 20:27:38 2015 UTC,"This is a good team - I like what they got and it allows the young players to do what they're good at without stepping out of their comfort zone.   Randle can bang in the post and be an Odom type player - Hibbert can cover for his defense and won't crowd the low post.  Russell can bring the shooting and passing while paying next to an athlete and has Hibbert behind him.  Kobe can also be free to score, and allows him even more leeway on offense.  This all puts less pressure on Clarkson who can be the utility kind of guy, facilitating and scoring as needed.  However, even if everyone plays the way they're supposed to, I see the Lakers as a lotto team.  Russell goes 15/7 and has a ROY caliber year with mediocre defense.  Clarkson has another 17/4/4 type of year, solidifying himself as a starter in the league.  Kobe goes 25/5/5, albeit on less efficiency than we're used to, and is a liability on defense.  Randle gets his 12/9 and shows an all-around game he did not show in college.  Hibbert gets back to 10/10/3 and plays somewhat consistently.  The Lakers have a young bench that'll bring energy although they can be inconsistent.  They end up ~3 places out of the playoffs and hand the 76ers the 10th pick or so."
lakers,3c5jmb,redundantPOINT,5,Sun Jul 5 02:52:21 2015 UTC,"I see the Lakers finishing with around 27-32 wins. Russell is going to need time to adjust to the pro game, as will Randle. Clarkson is going to need to find his role on a team that no longer features him. Kobe is going to take a lot of pressure off the young guys, but he's also going to take a lot of shots with a pretty low efficiency. Hibbert will be a nice defensive anchor but he doesn't bring much on offense.  Ultimately I think they will be fun to watch, but they probably aren't going to be very good. And they won't be bad enough to keep their pick. Ultimately it's a lost year, but that's good because with low expectations comes low pressure, which will benefit our young players."
lakers,3c5jmb,CapnGrundlestamp,12,Sun Jul 5 03:13:22 2015 UTC,This time last year Hibbert was one of the highest rated centres in the league. Now admittedly something happened to his mindset and didn't perform. But how many players manage to turn their career around with a good change of scenery?
lakers,3c5jmb,Brendan252,3,Sun Jul 5 01:18:01 2015 UTC,He was a strong DPOY candidate last year and one of the best defensive centers nearing the end of the season last season. I don't know what happened to him this year :/
lakers,3c5jmb,lolxddavid,2,Sun Jul 5 02:17:04 2015 UTC,His whole damn team was injured and it was clear the FO no longer wanted him
lakers,3c5jmb,undercoverbrutha,3,Sun Jul 5 08:36:06 2015 UTC,Maybe it was Larry bird treating him like shit?
lakers,3c5jmb,swaggerqueen16,2,Sun Jul 5 02:16:42 2015 UTC,Well that's not a good sign then because most likely Kobe is going to be hard on him.   Also he's moving from a small market team to the bright hollywood lights of LA so let's hope he changes his mindset and can perform under pressure.
lakers,3c5jmb,Schneeky,3,Sun Jul 5 06:43:20 2015 UTC,there is a difference between being tough on a teammate and a GM wanting to dump you ASAP.
lakers,3c5jmb,undercoverbrutha,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:36:49 2015 UTC,Maybe he performs well with a good team.
lakers,3c5jmb,PSSYPUNISHERRR,4,Sun Jul 5 03:45:59 2015 UTC,Reminded me of Steve Nash when we got him also on a 4th of July. I knew something will  happen today.   2-3 years ago we drool for Hibbert and George. Now we have one of them! Still a good job Mitch!  Our cap is completely safe in the next few years.   I just hope out rooks will pan out well to attract big names next summer.
lakers,3c5jmb,pAnDa_sHuRiKeN,9,Sun Jul 5 04:20:59 2015 UTC,Add to the fact that Hibbert has stayed pretty healthy through his career as well.
lakers,3c5jmb,supremesamurai,20,Sun Jul 5 00:43:52 2015 UTC,People on this subreddit have no faith at all.  Mitch is the best GM in the league and our FO are notoriously tight lipped.  I think Hibbert is honestly as good of a pickup as we could get.  I'd rather have him than LMA and I don't want to watch 2 hours of commercials every game while DJ gets hacked.  I'm very happy with this signing.  Now hopefully they lock down Upshaw.    Remember last year when this place was going crazy because we didn't sign Melo?
lakers,3c5jmb,aveydey,15,Sun Jul 5 00:32:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely, supper happy with this trade. If he gets close to his all star level, we have his bird rights, which could come in handy when trying to convince FAs next summer to join us. If he sucks, then we let him walk. Great deal all around. Classic Mitch move."
lakers,3c5jmb,GoingBackToMyWays,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:41:17 2015 UTC,Next summer every team will have cap space to outright sign Hibbert if they want to.  His bird rights aren't much of an asset
lakers,3c5jmb,barath_s,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:30:52 2015 UTC,"Well I'm under the impression he would like to stay here, if not it doesn't matter anyway."
lakers,3c5jmb,GoingBackToMyWays,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:04:39 2015 UTC,Bird rights are important because they can offer him the extra year of Max money.
lakers,3c5jmb,psychotichorse,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:21:52 2015 UTC,Really?  You want to offer Hibbert an extra year of max money?  when cap is super high and max will be too?   Hibbert is not the kind of franchise player who should get the max
lakers,3c5jmb,barath_s,2,Sun Jul 5 23:06:10 2015 UTC,The only reason you re-sign him is if he puts up great numbers and gets a max. Bird rights are only important if you're offering the max. That was what I was saying.
lakers,3c5jmb,psychotichorse,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:44:04 2015 UTC,Used to be important in other cases too. Eg. to give someone more than the midcap exception in a capped out league.
lakers,3c5jmb,barath_s,-7,Mon Jul 6 00:27:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because Durant is gonna be swayed because ""OMG ROY HIBBERT"" to play with us.  I understand the optimism, but let's temper our expectations a bit."
lakers,3c5jmb,gpholmes1,8,Sun Jul 5 03:05:46 2015 UTC,"Well it sure is better than saying come play with sacre. My expectations are tempered. I'm not expecting much of hibbert, but I also am not shitting on our front office decisions when they made a solid move considering the circumstances."

lakers,3c5jmb,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,6,Sun Jul 5 00:48:43 2015 UTC,Why is Mitch best in the league? I think he's great but honestly he's been disappointing so far.
lakers,3c5jmb,aveydey,16,Sun Jul 5 00:56:55 2015 UTC,Mitch has 5 rings since he took over as head GM of the Lakers... Pretty damn good record. He learned from Jerry West the greatest GM in NBA history.  He blew the league's mind when he traded for Pau.  He brought us CP3 and saved us money at the same time in a move SO GOOD it was deemed unfair by the league.  He became assistant GM in 1986 and head GM in 2000.  Do I need to say more?
lakers,3c5jmb,barath_s,2,Sun Jul 5 01:02:33 2015 UTC,Mitch has a spotty track record when it comes to picking coaches or getting ahead of a basketball trend
lakers,3c5jmb,FuriousFlex,3,Sun Jul 5 07:32:23 2015 UTC,The problem is the roster. unproven young players. Who would want to join the Lakers in their prime. They want to win now. This is why no one wanted to come to La....
lakers,3c5jmb,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,-3,Sun Jul 5 06:35:52 2015 UTC,"Back then he was great and the Pau trade was pure wizardry but in the recent years there has been teams like the Raptors, Celtics, Sixers, Warriors, and Spurs that have been killing it with signings and trades. Mitch failed to get talent last year and now he let one of our bright spots last season slip. He kept pursuing Aldridge even though it was obvious he wasn't signing here, especially because Mitch didn't use much analytics or actual basketball talk. He traded away a pick for Steve Nash, that will be a top pick next year and we could lose it. Now we have a decent young core and our rebuild might take 3-4 years. Mitch gets a lot of hate averted from him because we just blame the Buss children. In my opinion he's no longer the best GM."
lakers,3c5jmb,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Sun Jul 5 01:12:11 2015 UTC,"The ones you listed do have great front offices. Maybe better than Mitch.  Mitch is still great though. The Nash trade is only bad in retrospect, even if he were injured, if Kobe didn't tear his Achilles and Dwight therefore stayed, those picks would be low-value. The DH12 heist was great. The CP3 heist was great. Our draft picks look to be very much ""modern"": a 3&D guy in Anthony Brown, Russell over Okafor, etc. Clarkson was a great pickup, we'll see about Randle. Of course there's drafting Bynum, trading for Pau & Ariza, etc.  I agree the lack of analytics really hurts and that's probably the biggest shortcoming of the front office. Hopefully we improve on that front... until then yeah I can't see the Lakers' as having the best front office."
lakers,3c5jmb,ss3happy1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:30:29 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Mitch has a proven resume so I trust him. Still, a guy who was amazing 5 years ago doesn't mean he's still this good. Mitch hasn't had much to work with, but overall the past 3 seasons in general have been disappointing work by the FO. Some critical mistakes include the Nash signing, Falling for Nick Youngs inflated stats and overpaying him, and of course - the ineptitude of attracting FA during our pitches (apparently all our meetings with FA were underwhelming) and lack of a backup plan when these FA didn't want to come - ex: letting Ed get away. So maybe his GM career is one of the best In the nba, but based on recent performace, you definitely can't say he is CURRENTLY the best GM in the nba."
lakers,3c5jmb,barath_s,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:13:44 2015 UTC,"Mitch is pretty poor at picking coaches, which is one of the jobs of a gm. Buss gets the criticism and mitch gets a free ride. Mitch is pretty good at name talent, not quite as good at spotting unheralded breakout players or getting ahead of a trend like overseas players, analytics,  3and d etc  I think Ariza is the only significant guy who overperformed.. (bynum doesn't count). Not sure tuff juice counts either"

lakers,3c5jmb,Nathaaan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:03:05 2015 UTC,"Don't mind this move personally. At this point, the FA market is severely lacking decent big men, so under the circumstances Hibbert will likely be a solid player for our squad this year. The guy is a two time all-star, albeit on very good teams those years - but yes, has had his fair share of struggles as well.   For 15m (plus trade kicker) his contract is quite hefty, but it is expiring, leaving us around 5m to throw at one or two other players (preferably a SF/PF combo).   If Hibbert is underwhelming this year we can let him go or try and get him on the cheap (may or may not have his bird rights, can someone please confirm?). He is a great defensive minded centre who can play around 25 mpg and also has been pretty healthy the past few years (which for a man his size if very impressive) and will give us that rim protection we most desperately have needed - but don't expect too much offense. We see Robin Lopez has just gone to NY for 13m a year so this isn't a horrible move in the current market."

Depends on how Scott sets up the rotations, I had the backcourt as Kobe, Russell, and Clarkson but others believe Clarkson will be coming of the bench. I mean ideally is they can play off each other in transition then it could be fine, it is one thing to be ball dominant but these guys are actually pretty versatile. My reluctance is it comes down to coaching, but I think it can work to decent results."

lakers,3c7poa,srekalal,2,Sun Jul 5 17:57:00 2015 UTC,this is a decent tool
lakers,3c7poa,rejectx,0,Sun Jul 5 18:07:19 2015 UTC,"You could pick up a few decent FA's if KD doesn't come. I'd be fine picking up Waiters, Barnes, and Horford.  Edit: I noticed Drummond is an FA too. Has he signed an extention? If not, I'd want to go hard after him."
lakers,3c7poa,RyanLaFalce,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:18:46 2015 UTC,Not even giving hibbert a chance to bounce back to form in LA.  He was  an allstar just two seasons ago
lakers,3c7poa,teo1315,2,Sun Jul 5 20:51:33 2015 UTC,This is not a very good FA class.
lakers,3c7poa,Wateriswet1212,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:20:19 2015 UTC,Kd is the main target
lakers,3c7poa,FuriousFlex,3,Sun Jul 5 18:58:28 2015 UTC,"I have pipe drams of KD too, but we are not going to get him. He has 0 reason to come to LA when his title chances in OKC or even fucking Washington are better than here."
lakers,3c7poa,Wateriswet1212,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:05:11 2015 UTC,"Well, we don't know that. It really depends on how good our rookies are and if we can resign hibbert to a reasonable price if he plays well.   If D'Angelo was to have a breakout rookie year like Damian Lillard of MCW, then we would have a really attractive point guard on a rookie contract. Kobe would be off the books, and if randle plays really well, then I see no reason why not KD wouldn't consider us as a legitatite team for us to build around him.  The year after that, we would still have lots of cap space, and can make a run at the big FA again, but this time with Durant and Russell being the attractive pieces to entice players.  Its not likely, but there's definitely the possibility."
lakers,3c7poa,swaggerqueen16,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:12:59 2015 UTC,Yup makes sense
lakers,3c7poa,FuriousFlex,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:14:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're going to attract the major free agents next year. We don't have a strong enough foundation to attract the A-list guys, but there are some good players down the list I can see us going after. Hibbert is probably gone after next season, so we'll still have a hole in the middle. Jonas Valaciunas, Meyers Leonard, and John Henson are all interesting names at center."
lakers,3c7poa,Buckelroo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:21:35 2015 UTC,"If Hibbert plays well this year we'll have to think about keeping him.  Lakers have been terrible at the wing, but the small forwards outside KD next year are either restricted or old or gonna re-sign with the home team.   If LA loses this year's pick and KD doesn't leave for the Lakers I think Mitch revs up the tank again."
lakers,3c7poa,yungJoc,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:14:05 2015 UTC,Kobe Bryant is UFA. This offseason is HUGE guys. I wonder where he'll go!  In all seriousness the big fish is KD but there's a number of decent players.  Joakim Noah  Eric Gordon  Nicolas Batum  Luol Deng   Mike Conley   Jeff Green  Brandon Jennings  Harrison Barnes is RFA   Andre Drummond is RFA  Damian Lillard WAS going to be RFA. But he just signed an extension with Portland.

lakers,3c5wjf,ashishvp,28,Sun Jul 5 03:05:52 2015 UTC,I think it was a good move but 40 wins? Come on now.
lakers,3c5wjf,gpholmes1,35,Sun Jul 5 03:06:27 2015 UTC,"Last years team only had 21 wins but people didn't watch the Lakers, so they didn't know how much Lakers competed and how guys like Clarkson, Jabari Brown, Tarik Black improved bc of all that.  They were a healthy Kobe and Swaggy P away from just a smidge under 30 wins. We'll see how D'angelo Russell and Julius Randle add or subtract from that type of estimation.   edit: Also, people are still downvoting. Those are the trolls who aren't lakers fans visiting the subreddit or self hating lakers fan with no plans to entertain others' thoughts, comments, concerns on various subjects."
lakers,3c5wjf,lakers__sad_summer,8,Sun Jul 5 03:13:39 2015 UTC,Western conference is too comp for 40. I'll be really happy if we do though. I'd say we can win 30 games but be competitive in a lot of them. WE probably improve post all star break and start playing a lot better.
lakers,3c5wjf,megavino,10,Sun Jul 5 03:15:18 2015 UTC,I just want them to compete. I hope for very few blowouts. I want the young guys to get experience playing in close games and learn from the mamba.
lakers,3c5wjf,GoingBackToMyWays,5,Sun Jul 5 03:39:50 2015 UTC,yea that's the ideal situation. If we win games its a bonus
lakers,3c5wjf,megavino,6,Sun Jul 5 04:49:31 2015 UTC,"You never know. I'm going to keep an eye on the young players developing first, win column second."

lakers,3c5wjf,sumdue,3,Sun Jul 5 05:02:21 2015 UTC,"But you got OKC, Phoenix, Utah, and maybe Sacramento that will be in the mix also."
lakers,3c5wjf,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:33:08 2015 UTC,"40 win a is ideal, but realistically we might get to 30 wins to 35...which is an improvement if that happens."
lakers,3c5wjf,FuriousFlex,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:22:26 2015 UTC,Well Kobe didn't play a large portion of the season. I don't know why anybody thinks Jeremy Lin is any good. Russell hasn't played a single minute in an NBA game and I already think he's a major upgrade over Lin. We finally have a true center. I said from day 1 last year that the team sucked ass and was downvoted for it. I think our 2 new players plus Kobe makes us at least 15 games better.
lakers,3c5wjf,nu1stunna,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:33:08 2015 UTC,You don't think we can win 40 games in 3 years with this team?
lakers,3c5wjf,mike1883,2,Sun Jul 5 06:14:53 2015 UTC,In three years I would hope so.  But I was responding to the guy that thinks we will win 40 next year which is asinine.
lakers,3c5wjf,gpholmes1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:20:00 2015 UTC,I totally misread the situation. No I didn't it was a joke which I'm guessing you don't care for right now.

lakers,3c5wjf,DuncanDonuts32,9,Sun Jul 5 03:33:57 2015 UTC,all stars   Slow down there buddy. We'll see how they mesh together in the preseason games
lakers,3c5wjf,Scarlatina,4,Sun Jul 5 04:35:39 2015 UTC,When was the last time a team drafted 3 All-Stars back-to-back-to-back?
lakers,3c5wjf,Troof_sayer,3,Sun Jul 5 06:56:16 2015 UTC,OKC Thunder just did it about 5-6 years ago.
lakers,3c5wjf,Scarlatina,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:38:54 2015 UTC,"Is OKC the exception or the rule though? I can't think of any other team that has done it and I've been watching the NBA around 15 years now. Even with OKC, Westbrook, Harden, and Durant were all lottery picks... Clarkson is a second rounder, a great one, but probability is against him on being an All-Star."
lakers,3c5wjf,Troof_sayer,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:12:13 2015 UTC,"Also, didn't GS just do it with Steph, Klay, and Draymond.  Draymond was a late second rounder.  This is the recipe for getting it done. If all goes well Clarkson has as good of a chance at being an all star as Draymond."
lakers,3c5wjf,Scarlatina,2,Mon Jul 6 16:57:13 2015 UTC,"Draymond isn't an All-Star yet and was the 4th pick on the 2nd round, but I understand what you were trying to say. Also, Green probably shouldn't have fell that low, he was a monster of a player in college, but scouts gave him unfavorable grades due to his size (""'tweener"")."
lakers,3c5wjf,Rbk703,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:05:48 2015 UTC,"KD, Westbrook, Harden"
lakers,3c5wjf,iaminno,3,Mon Jul 6 05:06:56 2015 UTC,Not yet
lakers,3c5wjf,iaminno,6,Sun Jul 5 03:59:13 2015 UTC,warriors fan here. glad you guys were able to get hibbert. I hope he is there to stay. the nba is definitely more interesting when the lakers are relevant. I read somewhere that you might be giving up picks? not sure if I like that from the lakers. what are your guys thoughts on that?
lakers,3c5wjf,aveydey,6,Sun Jul 5 08:03:25 2015 UTC,I think it was 2 2nd round picks and the rights to an overseas player that will likely never join the NBA.  We're not losing any sleep over it
lakers,3c5wjf,BerriesNCreme,3,Sun Jul 5 08:07:57 2015 UTC,"wow another great trade then. always amazed to see what Mitch can pull off. what's the lineup now? Russell, Kobe, blank, ranked, hibbert? I think Gerald green is still available? you guys definitely need to go pick him up. best option at the 3 right now."
lakers,3c5wjf,aveydey,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:14:21 2015 UTC,"I think our lineup will be Russell, Clarkson, Kobe, Randle, Hibbert... Going for something closer to GSW lineup."
lakers,3c5wjf,lemurr,-1,Sun Jul 5 11:05:04 2015 UTC,"Around this sub KJ McDaniels is the buzz for our new SF.   He was with Philly and got traded to Houston, where he sat as a bench warmer. We're thinking Mitch will try to pick him up for like 4-5 mil.   Mitch is really hit or miss. He's best with all the small moves. (Getting us Lin for free last year, for example.) But I personally don't like him going after the big name guys. I'd rather build a deep team with 3 or 4 good players than a single superstar"
lakers,3c5wjf,TimeisIllmatic95,5,Sun Jul 5 08:25:24 2015 UTC,40 wins 8th seed   holy shit lol. Yall need to chill...the west hasnt gotten any easier. We gonna be the in the same spot next year. I need a top 3 pick
lakers,3c5wjf,Musingmike,2,Sun Jul 5 06:26:18 2015 UTC,"The west DID get easier.  Portland lost 4/5 starters, Clippers lost their defensive anchor and we'll at least split the season series with them.  Sacramento is a real ? If they will turn out to be good or not, Denver imploded... It's definitely possible the Lakers could steal the 8th playoff slot."
lakers,3c5wjf,Side-Pocket,3,Sun Jul 5 11:07:11 2015 UTC,Didn't think about this... You make a very good point #optimistic
lakers,3c5wjf,CaptainRatTrap,4,Sun Jul 5 21:29:17 2015 UTC,40? Lol. More like 30 MAYBE 35 if everyone stays healthy.
lakers,3c5wjf,PaperDesk,2,Sun Jul 5 06:31:06 2015 UTC,"I call it delusional. A 40 win season or an 8 seed? Come on man. I'm optimistic about the future, but sure as hell not next season. It's all about player development...not wins or seeds. The lakers getting a 10 seed would be huge..."
lakers,3c5wjf,Troof_sayer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:47:41 2015 UTC,If they can get more than 21 wins then I can call the season a minor success... It is going to be awhile before our rookies can evolve (assuming Buss doesn't trade them away to sign some has been veteran guy for ridiculous amounts of money) and maybe for the love of god don't pick up Carmelo.
lakers,3c5wjf,RyanLaFalce,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:53:19 2015 UTC,40 wins over the next two seasons maybe. Hibbert doesn't make us much better were still the worst team in the NBA on paper. Last years roster was more competitive then this roster this far
lakers,3c5wjf,cyborgspider,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:31:39 2015 UTC,"Come on man, we still aren't getting the 8th seed. OKC, HOU, LAC, DAL, SAS, NOP, and MEM are almost assuredly going to be better than us. Along with the fact the Suns have been just outside the playoff seeds for the past couple of seasons and that Utah has been really good for the past few seasons with the real potential to jump into the playoffs with all their young talent, I don't think there is a chance we are going to make it. Don't get me wrong, we made a really great trade to bring Roy over here, and I'm happy about all the other things we have done this offseason as well. Still though, I don't think it's reasonable to think we will be making the playoffs this year. Awesome year for development though."
lakers,3c8d5r,PaulKr,4,Sun Jul 5 21:21:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are really loving the Lou signing. I like it because he can help our bench scoring, but if we didn't get rid of Nick Young, it almost seemed redundant to have two players do almost the same thing (granted Lou is better at it than Nick). Someone mentioned it already, but Mitch is not really filling roster needs anymore. He's just going after assets now. We don't have a perimeter defender, so we'll have to rely on Anthony Brown to do the best he can for us."
lakers,3c8d5r,ss3happy1,2,Sun Jul 5 21:55:47 2015 UTC,"Until we're ready to push for a championship, acquiring the best assets we can seems to be the ideal strategy."
lakers,3c8d5r,SwolebrohamLincoln,2,Sun Jul 5 23:59:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think targeting a backup veteran guard before you secure a defensive wing was a smart move for the Lakers FO. We should have signed a wing, a veteran PF who won't take minutes from our young bigs, and then a veteran backup guard."
lakers,3c8d5r,jaysteezy24,-1,Sun Jul 5 21:26:28 2015 UTC,Jim Buss doesn't believe in defense. That's why he hired Pringles instead of Phil. Byron cares about defense but he's not running things. Jim is. I really believe we are in for a LOT of bad while he is still in charge and that will be at least another 2 years.
lakers,3c8d5r,Wise-Old-Man,4,Sun Jul 5 21:57:48 2015 UTC,"Fucking Pringles, man."
lakers,3c8d5r,spudwinkle,0,Sun Jul 5 22:02:13 2015 UTC,Totally....
lakers,3c8d5r,Wise-Old-Man,2,Mon Jul 6 01:42:53 2015 UTC,"It was Dr. Buss' decision to hire MDA because he wanted to try to bring showtime back. They have come out and said it was probably the wrong move...but it has nothing to do with ""Jim Buss not believing in defense."" That is dumb. He was respecting Dr. Buss' wishes."
lakers,3c8d5r,MightBeKanyeWest,-1,Sun Jul 5 23:20:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I disagree. Dr. Buss knew better. It's been all downhill since Jimmy took over. Once he is gone and if nothing changes, then come talk to me about not knowing what I am talking about. Until then as far as I am concerned it's all Jim's fault and little will change while he is around."
lakers,3c8d5r,Wise-Old-Man,2,Mon Jul 6 01:42:38 2015 UTC,There is nothing to disagree with. I am telling you a fact. Dr. Buss wanted to hire MDA.
lakers,3c8d5r,MightBeKanyeWest,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:50:07 2015 UTC,Hopefully the front office makes a trade.
lakers,3c8d5r,lemp44,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:32:35 2015 UTC,"Hibbert will make all of the perimeter better defenders as he did with Indiana all these years but yea the Lakers dont have one of those long, athletic wing defenders other than Anthony Brown who hasnt even made the team yet."
lakers,3c7m8w,LowkeyAnushole,3,Sun Jul 5 17:25:30 2015 UTC,"FO was only after 3 FA this year: LA, Monroe, DAJ Mitch already had in mind if they missed on those 3, he would just go for Hibbert. I'm guessing they don't want to commit too much money to role players unless we land a star or one of our core starts to show thier potential."
lakers,3c7m8w,vandiger,7,Sun Jul 5 17:45:14 2015 UTC,"Ed Davis is the only one. I'd rather have potentially motivated hibbert on an expiring deal in a contract year then robin lopez on that 4 year deal. Shumpert was going back to cleveland regardless. He got good money and I'm sure he loves playing with Lebron. Aaron Afflalo is a good wing but I'd rather get a younger wing who has room to grow or let Brown and Nance get experience. We know what afflalo is at this point so at this point after getting hibbert I'm perfectly fine with how free agency went. If we can somehow get Kj mcdaniels, it was a solid offseason."
lakers,3c7m8w,megavino,0,Sun Jul 5 17:34:33 2015 UTC,"I'm iffy on ed Davis.  IMO he's really a backup 4 that can play the 5 on occasion.  I would have liked to have him but we already have tarik black for much cheaper, so it never made much sense to bring him back.  I didn't think Shumpert was going to fit the team but I was trying to be fair with his name.  I think we could have signed Afflalo as a veteran player to start with and at least had some depth at the wing to either develop and or trade away down the line.  Definitely hoping for kj, just don't know if we can get him away from Houston."
lakers,3c7m8w,SwolebrohamLincoln,2,Sun Jul 5 17:53:02 2015 UTC,"Davis is a perfect 3rd big, true he is undersized for a traditional C but for someone playing the backup role that works just fine, especially in todays game. I agree with the thought on Tarik Black however, I really liked what he gave us last season so hopefully he can fill in that role well."
lakers,3c7m8w,Buckelroo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:28:16 2015 UTC,"Rolo, Kosta, Bismack, Marco Belinelli, Big Ed. The only one to be bummed about is Ed Davis. We were too busy chasing big names and let him slip away. Totally inexcusable."
lakers,3c7m8w,nighthawk88000,7,Sun Jul 5 17:39:19 2015 UTC,RoloKosta. . . of love!
lakers,3c7m8w,spudwinkle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:16:57 2015 UTC,I liked the idea of Demare Carroll after his breakout year - but he signed pretty quick.

lakers,3c7m8w,AaronOG,0,Sun Jul 5 19:36:54 2015 UTC,I think that if we would've gotten Hibbert first we could've attracted more free agents
lakers,3c7m8w,subtle_penguin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:22:56 2015 UTC,with that 5 mil in cap space?
lakers,3c7m8w,Kbmakaveli,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:32:35 2015 UTC,We only have 5 million in cap space with this trade though
lakers,3c7m8w,AaronOG,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"We don't pick up Sacre with Hibbert, that's like 2 three mil contacts maybe?"
lakers,3c7m8w,Kbmakaveli,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:38:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah for sure, just no big name guys would be possible"
lakers,3c7m8w,PaperDesk,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:04:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  he would have made us viable for other free agents but then again he takes up so much of the cap that we wouldn't have had much left to do anything with."
lakers,3c7m8w,PaperDesk,0,Sun Jul 5 21:18:40 2015 UTC,"We really did miss out on DJ and Aldridge. Both gave us meetings and chose to go some place else. We had realistic shots to pick them up, but it just didn't work out. We could have probably have also gotten any of the players that New York picked up (Rolo or Aaron Afflalo). Players like Greg Monroe or Tobias Harris would have been nice, but it was unlikely to pick up Harris considering he was a RFA and Greg Monroe would not have fit well with Randle. Overall I'm happy with the offseason with the draft and the trade we made to get Hibbert. I still don't think we will make the playoffs this year, but at least it will be fun to watch."
lakers,3c89kx,hman9294,5,Sun Jul 5 20:51:26 2015 UTC,It's been made clear Kobe will be playing a lot of forward
lakers,3c89kx,SlightlyRyan,2,Sun Jul 5 20:53:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he will, but we currently have no one who is a true small forward. I don't expect Kobe to be guarding guys like Lebron, KD, PG, Wiggins, & Melo on a nightly basis. His body can't handle that at this point in his career."
lakers,3c89kx,SlightlyRyan,2,Sun Jul 5 21:00:32 2015 UTC,yeah. I think thats why we drafted a 3&d guy
lakers,3c89kx,badguymatt,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:28:22 2015 UTC,"Josh Smith isn't a small forward, dawg."
lakers,3c89kx,jaysteezy24,3,Sun Jul 5 21:03:03 2015 UTC,"Nope we don't have the funds for players after this head scratching signing. Swaggy  needs to be moved, but I doubt any team will touch him right now because he has no value after his awful season. Wilson Chandler would be nice, but Denver would probably laugh at us if we even try to do a straight up trade for him."
lakers,3c89kx,joelee1711,3,Sun Jul 5 23:28:40 2015 UTC,"I think Larry Nance and Anthony Brown can become good role players at the least.  I would not bring back Wes and give Brown a chance.  I don't really see much out there that we can afford for a small forward.  Who would even do a nick young for wilson chandler deal?    Also, I like Clarkson better as a PG, but I do see  him as more of a combo guard.  He'll play SG along russell, but I'd like to see him function as more of a PG when playing with Lou next year.    There is just no fucking room for Swaggy..I'd love his contract if he played just 80% as good as the year with Dantoni, but it's clearly not working out with a shit coach like Byron."
lakers,3c89kx,NicDwolfwood,2,Sun Jul 5 20:56:16 2015 UTC,Kobe will be the SF  smart thing to do is let Russell and Clarkson run the backcourt together
lakers,3c89kx,NicDwolfwood,2,Sun Jul 5 20:56:34 2015 UTC,Kobe can't guard today's dynamic SF's at this point in his career. We need someone to take that pressure off of him.
lakers,3c89kx,Tbuckelew,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:55:13 2015 UTC,"I agree on that front. but I think the best thing moving forward is the Russell-Clarkson backcourt. I see no reason why relegate Clarkson to the bench.  Kobe can do just fine at the SF. there are only a handful of dynamic forwards at that spot, the rest are 3&D guys"
lakers,3c89kx,SSD65,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:02:55 2015 UTC,"Jeff Green has no reason to move, and Memphis wouldn't do it anyways. There should be clarifications about the complications with Hibbert's contract and our available cap space coming out soon. Until the, It's safe to assume that we are out of money."

lakers,3c88rs,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:50:47 2015 UTC,Any possibility its a sign and trade where we send Ryan Kelly and Robert Sacre over to Toronto? I think those two combine for 2.7 million in cap space.
lakers,3c88rs,aeisenst,8,Sun Jul 5 20:52:16 2015 UTC,I don't know. Do you think Williams would be willing to join a Lakers team without Sacre? Sounds like a dealbreaker.
lakers,3c88rs,jerkidiot,4,Sun Jul 5 20:56:37 2015 UTC,Yeah if we lose Sacre we can kiss any future big name FA's goodbye
lakers,3c88rs,ss3happy1,2,Sun Jul 5 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"I can't believe I'm saying this...but we can't trade Sacre. If Upshaw doesn't pan out, we still need a backup Big. Tarik Black will probably be the backup PF to randle."
lakers,3c88rs,aveydey,3,Sun Jul 5 21:15:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think I can handle seeing Robert Sacre play minutes for us anymore. Even if Upshaw doesn't perform that well in summer league I'm sure hes still light years better than what Sacre has to offer to us, the only way I see him not getting a contract is if all the red flags he had coming out of college starts popping up again."

lakers,3c6lj1,tks91,2,Sun Jul 5 09:19:33 2015 UTC,Yet people try to question Kobe's defense just because he's old and coming off injuries now. Kobe was an amazing defender in his prime and even in 2012 he was guarding guys like Kyrie still. When he first came back in the 13/14 season he even tried to go one on one with KD defending him.

lakers,3c5bl9,likwidsage,12,Sat Jul 4 23:02:31 2015 UTC,LMAO. one of the funniest things I've seen involving an athlete
lakers,3c5bl9,Drawsomeawesome,6,Sat Jul 4 23:19:37 2015 UTC,The Irving one is pretty good. The guy is going to have a fantastic media career once he is done.

lakers,3c5bl9,dissphemism,8,Sun Jul 5 00:30:54 2015 UTC,This is why I'm hoping a change of scenery gives him confidence back in his game. He's genuinely a great person.

lakers,3c5bl9,TuneHD,5,Sun Jul 5 01:24:52 2015 UTC,He's got that improve game. lol
lakers,3c59xz,RolloJTomasi,25,Sat Jul 4 22:45:27 2015 UTC,"Knick fan checking in, I think it's a great move with little risk.  He's in a contract year with the potential for a huge payday if he plays well.  His per36 numbers have been very consistent and the Lakers definitely needed a rim protector.  Russell,Clarkson,Kobe,Randle and Hibbert, not a bad starting five.  If he doesn't pan out, pull the plug and walk away."
lakers,3c59xz,ynksjts,4,Sat Jul 4 23:03:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thought. Contract years more often than not being out a player's best and couple that with the cap increase he's going to want to get paid. Low risk with a high reward and our new guys can develop around him, should be exciting to watch next year."
lakers,3c59xz,PAO_RT_IN_THE_KISSER,36,Sun Jul 5 00:32:23 2015 UTC,"We are basically getting him for free, which is fantastic. Nice move."
lakers,3c59xz,Lyqu1d,14,Sat Jul 4 22:49:20 2015 UTC,A nice mentor for Upshaw too. Both defense first players
lakers,3c59xz,PaulKr,12,Sat Jul 4 22:55:37 2015 UTC,That was my first thought. Hubert + Upshaw has some massive rim protection potential.
lakers,3c59xz,JustaGangsta,7,Sat Jul 4 23:01:57 2015 UTC,"This is perfect for Upshaw imo. If he ends up making the roster, he gets to be a backup to a respectable big and gets a full NBA season under his belt. Give it a year or two and I can definitely foresee him being our starting center of the future."
lakers,3c59xz,tuphnamja,5,Sat Jul 4 23:09:16 2015 UTC,Yes. I really hope Upshaw impresses during summer league. That would give us some nice front court depth.
lakers,3c59xz,KMSC18,14,Sat Jul 4 23:01:50 2015 UTC,Maybe a stupid question: which overseas players does LA own the rights to?
lakers,3c59xz,RemoteClancy,20,Sat Jul 4 22:53:24 2015 UTC,Ater Majok. The 58th pick in the 2011 draft

lakers,3c59xz,mister_greyMATTER,2,Sat Jul 4 23:02:50 2015 UTC,So why does Indiana want his rights when the Lakers can just absorb Hibbert's contract?
lakers,3c59xz,misterrunon,8,Sun Jul 5 02:55:04 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty happy, we at least finally made a move! He's an expiring contract, so Mitch is doing the same thing as last off season to try maintain CAP for the next free agency. Hopefully this upcoming rebuilding year will see the rise of the rookies to attract some FA next year."
lakers,3c59xz,ss3happy1,4,Sat Jul 4 23:05:18 2015 UTC,"A nice problem to have is Hibbert playing out of his mind, and putting up super numbers. Do we max him, or let him walk. If he doesn't put up decent enough numbers, we can let him walk and preserve our cap space."
lakers,3c59xz,Titanosaurus,4,Sun Jul 5 00:49:37 2015 UTC,He will likely have more value at the deadline as he had a bad year with low confidence and this is his contract year with the cap going up. He will have a lot of motivation and will be very coveted by a team desperate for help down low. Someone will get injured or have an off year and a team will be willing to trade more than this come deadline imo

lakers,3c59xz,SSD65,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:00:39 2015 UTC,Hibbert is getting paid about 15 mil. So we've got like 13 mil left
lakers,3c59xz,ashishvp,2,Sat Jul 4 23:14:51 2015 UTC,"We technically had $28mil but really only had $22 after the cap holds for Russell, nance and all of the roster spots.  We've only got $7 mil left, and might have less because Hibbert has a trade kicker"
lakers,3c59xz,squirrely_control,-4,Sun Jul 5 02:39:12 2015 UTC,"come on we didn't wanted to trade Pau for Boozer (and likely few first rounders), but we are doing this and giving away picks? I don't know how so many of you are actually happy with this. We should have made moves that potentially get us picks, not the other way around."
lakers,3c59xz,rejectx,7,Sat Jul 4 22:54:28 2015 UTC,"It's not secret that the Lakers are desperate for a center, the Pacers used that to their advantage. Any other year this would've been a bad trade but now we have great rim protector and he isn't on the books for next year which leaves us with a ton of cap space and bird rights to him at the end of the season if he plays well and they want to keep him....not a bad move in my opinion."
lakers,3c59xz,peglegjohn,10,Sat Jul 4 23:09:15 2015 UTC,"If we did this trade maybe 2 years ago, the Pacers would've been the laughingstock of the NBA. Hibbert was an All-Star, maybe top 5 center just a few years back."
lakers,3c59xz,ashishvp,4,Sat Jul 4 23:16:27 2015 UTC,Hahaha yeah obviously we would've had to part with a lot more than some picks back then.
lakers,3c59xz,peglegjohn,-3,Sun Jul 5 00:08:06 2015 UTC,why we are exactly desperate when we will be bottom 5 team in the NBA?
lakers,3c59xz,rejectx,3,Sat Jul 4 23:10:26 2015 UTC,"It might be kobes last year they are still going to try and build somewhat of a ""competitive"" team and they can do it without risking next years cap space. They can still tank this season if they have to."
lakers,3c59xz,peglegjohn,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:11:16 2015 UTC,This isnt truem we arent going to try and be contenders. This is just a solid guy and a name for the casual fans who have been complaining about signing someone.  Ita a bad move because we gave up picks for someone that we didnt have to give up anything for. We shouldve gotten picks for his shitty contract
lakers,3c59xz,DaRealDucane,4,Sun Jul 5 02:54:47 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I thought. I was thinking it would be on the same lines of the Lin trade so we take their 1st rounder next year (if they still own it) for Hibbert's contract. We would've still given them the rights to Majok.
lakers,3c59xz,Trebolations,2,Sat Jul 4 22:59:44 2015 UTC,Don't we have enough young guys right now. We need some solid players.
lakers,3c59xz,Neilmev,-4,Sat Jul 4 22:57:12 2015 UTC,"if we will wait next year on superstars again he will just leave in FA like everyone else did or we will have to overpay him, he is on terrible deal and Pacers were desperate to trade him to avoid luxury tax, we got screwed."
lakers,3c59xz,rejectx,3,Sat Jul 4 23:00:56 2015 UTC,"We're not going to overpay him, especially if he stinks it up this year. This is about as low-risk as it gets. We needed a center and Indiana needed to free up some cap space. Nobody got screwed."

lakers,3c59xz,CAPTAIN_TITTY_BANG,-1,Sat Jul 4 23:00:07 2015 UTC,actually there are great players every year in second round so it's definitively a rule.

lakers,3c59xz,Terry_Pandee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:35:44 2015 UTC,"They did limit the amount of money teams could sell picks for, so it is true that it is more difficult than it was 10 years ago."

lakers,3c59xz,rejectx,4,Sat Jul 4 23:37:18 2015 UTC,We could move nick young or Ryan Kelly if we want 2nd rounders too. You can get all the 2nd rounders you want in this league. This is a good 1 year rental at a position we desperately needed.
lakers,3c59xz,Terry_Pandee,0,Sat Jul 4 23:39:42 2015 UTC,actually if Nick Young keeps being as lazy as he was this year we would have to give up second rounders to move him.
lakers,3c59xz,rejectx,0,Sat Jul 4 23:40:46 2015 UTC,Nah an injury here or there and he's a hot commodity come deadline time for a contender needing a boost off the bench. 2nd rounder would be easy to get for him.
lakers,3c59xz,Terry_Pandee,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:46:47 2015 UTC,i think he tried to buy a very late one to secure upshaw. that's how i read it considering he called upshaw's agent draft night for a summer league invitation.
lakers,3c59xz,seddard,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:55:22 2015 UTC,Everyone here is crazy saying we can just buy a second round pick. It doesn't happen often and only happens if the pick is worth nothing to the team that owns it. Second rounders are becoming more and more valuable every year and if we will continue to suck then there's a good chance that pick could get us a cheap rotation player. I'm not against this trade though.
lakers,3c59xz,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:06:07 2015 UTC,"From my count, there have been ~11 players selected to All-Star Games/All-NBA teams from the second round since 2000. Like you said in another post, you can definitely get bench level players and I have faith in the ability of the Lakers FO to identify those players. However, the chance of finding a star is extremely low. 11 out of 450 (the number of second rounders since 2000, not including this year's rookies) is less than 2.5%. You could field a team of 15 second rounders and have a very high chance of not getting a single franchise piece from any of the 15. (~69% if all second round picks had equal hit rate, which I know probably is not the case)."
lakers,3c59xz,Parkinsonian,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:02:44 2015 UTC,Every year I can name...1 player.   A single player out of 30 in the 2nd round that have made a significant impact in the NBA
lakers,3c59xz,ashishvp,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:21:30 2015 UTC,"We used cash to get Clarkson. No need to worry about the second round, if the lakers see potential they'll buy the player or trade something."
lakers,3c59xz,DynoDunks,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:01:24 2015 UTC,"Two thing: first, we are now loaded with young talent, so a second round pick isn't as valuable anymore. Second, every year there are a couple teams willing to trade their second round pick for cash, so if there's someone that warrants it, we can always buy back in, which is actually exactly what we did with Clarkson."
lakers,3c59xz,KaosAlpha,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:05:25 2015 UTC,"unless those are like top 50 protected I don't agree, you can always find great rotational pieces even in second round or combine them for better assets, giving away even second rounders sets us back, what if Nick Young or someone becomes dead salary? You could have used those picks to make a salary dump, we should have gotten pick for salary dump not given away, even if we signed Kosta Koufas as our starter it would be better value considering we are not giving anything away and still have more cap space left."
lakers,3c59xz,rejectx,2,Sat Jul 4 23:09:23 2015 UTC,"Signing a FA like Koufas would require a longer term commitment and tie up cap, especially this year. I mean, look around, 52M for Chandler, 54M for Lopez and 15.5M starting (yes, that's just the first year) for Kanter, for fucking Kanter! I'm someone who wanted Chandler but not at that price. These deals are frankly out of control in anticipation of the cap increases the next two years. To me, it looks like a sound decision to send off a second rounder for a 28 year old center that was an all star just a season and half ago. One who's also on an expiring deal that gives us his bird rights and keeps him a RFA in the event he turns it around. Also, while there's usually one or two breakouts from the second round each year, it is far more likely that any one given second round pick is a bust."
lakers,3c59xz,KaosAlpha,0,Sat Jul 4 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"you could sign Koufas for similar deal like we did with Jordan Hill and he would accept gladly, there offers that are left for him are most likely mid-level options. I wanted Hibbert, but I was not expecting us to give picks that's why I am mad, I hope they are heavily protected or there is something more to this trade. Also they had zero leverage in this trade, they wanted to dump him, so why are we paying?"
lakers,3c59xz,rejectx,0,Sat Jul 4 23:44:52 2015 UTC,"We traded for clarkson. Relax, if theres 2nd round talent we want well trade for it."
lakers,3c59xz,DeangeloRussell,0,Sat Jul 4 23:00:31 2015 UTC,We might go into this year with five rookies. We don't need more 2nd round picks.
lakers,3c8cuf,_monsterpoon,3,Sun Jul 5 21:19:05 2015 UTC,1 - Denver doesn't do that trade.  2 - Gerald Green is identical to Nick Young. No point of doing that.

lakers,3c8cuf,WOX_69,2,Sun Jul 5 21:26:58 2015 UTC,"Please educate me on how. All I see is volume shooters off the bench who do not play any defense whatsoever (Nick is probably even better defensively), don't go to the rim like they should and settle for bad shots, they're around the same age as well so it's not that. Young just wasn't healthy last year."
lakers,3c8cuf,PaulKr,-1,Sun Jul 5 21:32:20 2015 UTC,"What the hell? Nick Young is a HORRENDOUS  defensive player, as he is with rebounding and playmaking.  Stop with the excuse with that he wasn't healthy, he was healthy until he busted his knee up. And with that his stats were on par with the rest of career. He's just a shitty player."

lakers,3c4xlp,GeorgeLovesBOSCO,26,Sat Jul 4 22:13:52 2015 UTC,"Let's fucking do it. Two scenarios can come outta this:  a) it gives us solid depth and an actual starting 5. A trade for Hibbert (I think his contract is what 15 mill?) would still leave us room for a guy like KJ. If Hibbert flops, he comes off the book next season and at least we can say we tried something this offseason.   b) the return of Hibbert. perhaps Roy returns to his old form in LA (bare with me), and performs well enough for another contract the year after. This is his contract year, and if he had declined his option he wouldn't be getting paid what he is today. He's gotta show that he's still worth some $$$."

lakers,3c4xlp,owningypsie,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:49:32 2015 UTC,I think this rule helps centers who use it to their advantage. Mozgov used it well in the playoffs. So I don't see why it hurt his game.

lakers,3c4xlp,supremesamurai,3,Sat Jul 4 21:30:15 2015 UTC,"Do it. He's on a one year deal, and he's a better defender than any free agent center/big man left on the market, if he keeps his head straight. This would preserve cap space for next year too. Get this fucking done please."
lakers,3c4xlp,Remote95,5,Sat Jul 4 20:57:05 2015 UTC,Hope the Lakers would be getting a 1st round pick for next year too.
lakers,3c4xlp,TimeisIllmatic95,9,Sat Jul 4 21:07:51 2015 UTC,"Just in case some of you think this isn't a good move:   We could like land some assets (eg a pick) with Hibbert- much like we did with the Lin trade last year.  Hibbert's contract expires in a year, meaning that we do not have to commit long term to him. We can just let him walk in FA.  He would give us some much needed rim protection for a year- he is a legit center and a elite defender. We could use that for a year considering that some of y'all want Upshaw to start lol. Also, squad depth.  And plus, if Hibbert regains his offensive game, we would own his Bird rights and would be in the primary position to resign him if we wanted too.    In other words, Hibbert helps our team development by giving our young players a legit center to play with, and can help our rebuild if we gain assets."
lakers,3c4xlp,bombchron,3,Sat Jul 4 21:01:52 2015 UTC,Solid assessment. Hibbert is a headcase like no other in the NBA. I believe the Lakers situation is low-pressure enough for him to attempt to regain his offensive rhythm without being berated for being unproductive.
lakers,3c4xlp,Camus145,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:02:11 2015 UTC,Why would the pacers be so desperate to pay draft picks in order to send out Hibbert?
lakers,3c4xlp,SuperBowlDolphin,2,Sat Jul 4 21:39:40 2015 UTC,"Cap relief. Same reason the Rockets gave out a first while dealing Lin last year. Hibbert is due to make around $15.8million (I may be wrong). They've clearly stated they want to move on from Hibbert and already have his replacement in Turner. To offload that contract, I dont see why they may not include a pick in there."
lakers,3c4xlp,Russell2LA,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:46:16 2015 UTC,I'm 100% confident another team would take him without any picks. Plus the Pacers aren't even near as good as the Rockets where last year.
lakers,3c4xlp,bmarshall12,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:43:40 2015 UTC,"Possibly. Pacers are in the East though, and depending what we offer back to the Pacers, they may throw in a pick to make it even. Not saying that we'll 100% get a pick, but I'm saying that it's plausible."
lakers,3c4xlp,Lyqu1d,-5,Sun Jul 5 00:15:23 2015 UTC,"I want him however we are going to be better than the blazers, nuggets, sixers, hawks, suns if we make this trade are you willing not to have a lottery pick next year and give it to the sixers the pick will most likely be 4-8"

lakers,3c4xlp,lemp44,2,Sat Jul 4 20:48:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think we are gonna be tanking, we only have top 3 picks protected.

lakers,3c4xlp,Thefirmbiz,3,Sat Jul 4 21:42:33 2015 UTC,Because he has an expiring deal that'll end after next season. And having a defensive anchor to at least help cover up the young guys mistakes on defense is huge for their development.

lakers,3c4xlp,SantaMariaD17,3,Sat Jul 4 20:59:06 2015 UTC,We will likely get a pick out of the deal. Plus he's an expiring contract. Doesn't affect our cap space for next season. Pretty much the same thing we did last season with Lin.

lakers,3c4xlp,TimeisIllmatic95,0,Sat Jul 4 21:16:40 2015 UTC,Yeah yeah We pick up his contract like a Jeremy Lin situation. The issue is all the free agents out there this offseason and the big move the organization makes is Roy Hibbert. You don't have to agree on him being a bum ass center fact is his game doesn't lie.

lakers,3c6b8d,the_wheyfinder,5,Mon Jul 6 03:39:23 2015 UTC,"I prefer KJ Mcdaniels over those two, but if I had to choose veteran back ups, I think Beno Udrih would be better because Brooks seems like the type of player who wants 20+ mins a game, and I would rather just let Clarkson and Russell handle the majority of our point guard minutes.  And for small forward I want Luc Richard Mbah a Moute even though Wright shoots it a lot better than him, I prefer his defensive ability over a guy who hasn't been able to really play defense in recent years due to injuries."
lakers,3c6b8d,jaysteezy24,2,Sun Jul 5 07:25:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah KJ McDaniels would be perfect, but knowing Morey, he won't let him go easily. Anyway, I hope Kobe has some sort of Indian summer defensively. If not, just try to outscore the other team and rely on Hibbert to clean up their mistakes!"
lakers,3c6b8d,jaysteezy24,3,Sun Jul 5 08:14:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe sign and trade with them, send Jeremy Lin to the Rockets for KJ Mcdaniels, iunno. But yeah that's why I said Luc Richard might help us defensively cause if we look at our team Hibbert is our only known defender, while guys like A.Brown and Nance were good on defense in college, but we don't know if they can have the same impact in the NBA. Taric Black was praised by Byron Scott this past season as our most vocal defender, so we'll see if he can do it for 82 games."
lakers,3c6b8d,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Sun Jul 5 08:18:55 2015 UTC,"Tarik was great, when he started playing in favor of Boozer and also Kobe got injured (love him but his off-ball defense might be the worst in the league), our defense picked up quite a bit. 110 ppg given up before the ASG, 103 after."
lakers,3c6b8d,flea61,2,Sun Jul 5 18:57:52 2015 UTC,"I really really want Dorell Wright but I'd prefer Farmar, Udrih or even Andre Miller at point guard. They just seem like better veteran mentors for our young guys than Brooks."

Let's not forget he's one of the worst off-ball defenders in the league (look at any advanced defensive stat... they're all flawed but when they all agree that he's a bad defender, he's probably a bad defender), so if he puts up 18pt-5ast-4rbd with terrible defense and good efficiency (which might be a good season for him), which could maybe be worth $12 mil in the new cap, something like $9 mil would be fair. He's been paid something like $78 mil the last 3 seasons, so he can do the Lakers a solid if he wants to come back.  The Lakers need to keep cap space open for free agency, after all."

lakers,3c62to,lakers__sad_summer,11,Sun Jul 5 04:23:01 2015 UTC,Kobe in his prime is historically good on defense. Current Kobe is a defensive liability because he just doesn't have the ability to succeed on offense while putting forth significant effort on defense
lakers,3c62to,megavino,-6,Sun Jul 5 04:48:21 2015 UTC,"'Pretty weak anecdotal evidence, considering he's not played much and Kobe is a gym rat. Kobe is also wise enough to play elite off/def whenever he wants. Not for a full four quarters, but certainly when it matters."
lakers,3c62to,justgivingsomeadvice,0,Sun Jul 5 04:52:20 2015 UTC,"Kobe is literally one of the worst off-ball defensive players in the league. Defensive rotations, when you're old and susceptible to fatigue, are a matter of effort, because there's at least one level of buffer (the current ballhandler has to pass to the guy to be able to punish you) and that makes it easier for a tired player to justify not playing defense. Kobe can be an elite on-ball defender still, though.  Every defensive stat agrees he's horrible defensively, including on/ off numbers, RPM, DWS, D RTG, etc."

Kobe will clamp down on D and play better D then 95% of the NBA. But on a night to night basis, you're right, he doesn't have enough left in the tank to give it all on both ends, and we all know which end he prefers"
lakers,3c62to,justgivingsomeadvice,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:09:21 2015 UTC,"the worst was when he would gamble or let his man go, then get mad when his man scores. even worst was when byron scott pretty much rips everyone on defense and lets kobe off the hook. Lakers last year pretty much had Kobe and 4 people playing defense for him."
lakers,3c62to,mattre7,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"He plays good on-ball D. His off-ball D has consistently been horrible since like 2010, even before he tore his Achilles. In 2012-2013, there was one game against the Wizards where he let Ariza hit 8 3s but giving him wide open shots.   Every defensive metric has him as one of the worst defenders in the league: defensive RAPM, DRTG, defensive win shares, on/ off numbers, etc. It's because he gets lazy on defense and doesn't hit his rotations.   He was better in 2014-2015 than years past (probably b/c of Byron) but when he would get tired from playing too much offense, he'd revert to being horrible again. Hopefully he can have a good defensive season again with a smaller offensive burden this year"

lakers,3c62to,PineappleGrenade,5,Sun Jul 5 04:40:14 2015 UTC,"Dude, don't count Kobe out on defense. I'm not the world biggest Kobe fan but that guy is heartless on defense. Strips, blocks, charges..he's still going to be doing at least a fraction of that next year and that would still be better than most SG/SF hybrids.  And Julius Randle getting abused? I doubt it. He's a year older and took additional time off to reshape his body. He can also be going against smaller players bc his skills make a lot of missmatched/lapses for the other team."

lakers,3c43xh,likwidsage,49,Sat Jul 4 17:11:03 2015 UTC,Duncan will be making 6m this year... Fuck his paycutting ways.
lakers,3c43xh,Scarlatina,9,Sat Jul 4 16:18:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, damn Duncan and his prioritizing his team above himself! It is almost like Duncan knows he has already made enough money for 4 lifetimes and still has his endorsements deals on top of all of it."
lakers,3c43xh,likwidsage,7,Sat Jul 4 18:40:31 2015 UTC,Damn him for being against competition. Don't get why people have a hard time accepting it just because it's Duncan. The heat caught flak for it. And every player other than Duncan does.
lakers,3c43xh,siphillis,5,Sat Jul 4 18:56:33 2015 UTC,"It's his job to entertain his fans, not maintaining the state of competition within the league.  If he feels taking a paycut allows him to do his job better, then more power to him.  Dirk does the exact same thing in Dallas.  Hell, Michael Jordan played for pocket change for most of his career.  If Kobe took a huge paycut to help out the team, would you really be telling him to go fuck himself for being against competition?  We shouldn't get on people's cases for whatever salary they're able, and willing, to negotiate.  It's their decision."
lakers,3c43xh,likwidsage,-4,Sat Jul 4 19:40:11 2015 UTC,"I can't agree. I watch basketball to watch people compete against each other. Not to make super teams with known all stars to kill competition. I hate Dirk and Lebron just as much for doing it. You should make what you're worth, instead of taking less and having ESPN run articles about you and how you're making less. That's how the whole world works. MJ didn't play for pocket change, the cap was just a lot lower and he signed a 8 year deal. He took as much as he could get when ever he could. If Kobe took a paycut I'd say the same thing. I'm only a Kobe fan because I'm a Laker fan. He's done a lot of wrong, and that would also be one of them. When we're paying to watch a competitive league, I feel we have every right to complain about people being anti-competitive. That said, I know it's only my opinion. I just find NBA to very boring compared to what it used to be."
lakers,3c43xh,siphillis,2,Sat Jul 4 21:17:35 2015 UTC,"Fair enough.  I don't think many call either the Mavericks or Spurs a ""superteam"" like the Miami Heat, but in a perfect world, ever team would be great.  Legends taking paycuts interferes with this process."
lakers,3c43xh,fkndead,2,Sat Jul 4 21:44:35 2015 UTC,"Past a certain point money is meaningless is what you don't seem to get, and now you're twisting your whole world-view according to your favorite team's superstar. Life hardly changes whether you earn 10 or 30 mil a year. In either case you can do whatever the fuck you want."

lakers,3c43xh,likwidsage,0,Sun Jul 5 06:08:29 2015 UTC,"Keep making those assumptions. Obviously and 30 million/year player lives better than a 10mil/year player. If money was so useless, you wouldn't have billionaires. Understand money is the thing that runs the world, there no such thing as too much. Ask any person that makes that much."
lakers,3c43xh,nu1stunna,-55,Sat Jul 4 23:07:18 2015 UTC,It's seriously bullshit. They should implement some rule in the cba that any player who's made the all star game at least 3 times and once in the past 5 years cannot make any less than 10-12 million a season. This will end this nonsense.

lakers,3c43xh,Seanloleey,5,Sat Jul 4 17:57:19 2015 UTC,You would not take that big of a pay cut if it was you lets be honest. I would easily take the Kobe route get as much as I can. The career of a basketball player is to short to take paycuts IMO.
lakers,3c43xh,Musingmike,10,Sat Jul 4 16:55:36 2015 UTC,The best in the game can afford pay cuts because they get endorsements. The people who can't are the ones who are middle or bottom tier players.
lakers,3c43xh,BerriesNCreme,2,Sat Jul 4 17:18:22 2015 UTC,I would absolutely do what Kobe did and take the money they fucking offered. These whiny bitches can suck a dick. Kobe deserves that money. He's put his body through the meat shredder to play basketball. Hes done experimental treatments upon experimental treatments to keep his body going. He's been a huge part of bringing 5 championships to this city for this team. Then you're gonna say he should make less...fuck that
lakers,3c43xh,pbsun,3,Sat Jul 4 18:23:22 2015 UTC,"Kobe's made enough money to live 2 lifetimes without the need to work, he can afford a pay cut."
lakers,3c43xh,L075,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:59:23 2015 UTC,"And then you look at Duncan's career earnings, which is close to a quarter BILLION dollars. At age 40, with over 200 million made and what not, the difference between what Timmy is making now as opposed to Kobe can and will never over compensate what a ring will do for either's legacy at this point. If I was Kobe, and someone offered me a 15 mill pay cut and a legit shot at a ring? Not even a question he's taking that 10/10 times."
lakers,3c43xh,likwidsage,2,Sat Jul 4 18:36:04 2015 UTC,They won't do anything about it. It makes their argument for giving owners more money that much easier. How could you say you need a higher cap when everyone is taking paycuts? You can't.

We're the shitheels, the NBA's 4th worst franchise and nobody wants to be here not even Lin, Boozer or Hill who all suck shit, as far as I'm concerned. We draft the next LeBron in 10 years but don't win with him in the first 5 and he goes somewhere else. That's my only hope for this team. We are the Cavs now without LeBron finding a conscious. And we have the Cavs coach to show for it. We're complete shit in the NBA today!!! Yayyyy!!!!"

He is a complete defensive liability and with Westbrook and Steph in the West it'd take a fortunate string of events to avoid them. If anyone watched the playoffs and the Spurs down the stretch Parker just looked like trash.   Laker centric opinion: Learn to enjoy this time. So long we've been scratching at ""win now"" ""fix it now."" This is the first time we've had a chance to be young and develop guys like OKC did. Remember 2011 when we were old AF and getting run around? Now we have that youth. Give Russell, Randle, Clarkson, Brown a shot (and maybe Upshaw/Black)."
lakers,3c43xh,DonMakaveli,3,Sat Jul 4 16:59:45 2015 UTC,"They may start Patty Mills and use Parker off the bench, FWIW. It's not gonna make a huge difference vs. GSW/HOU/OKC, but they'll find a way to make any matchup a series since they always fucking seem to."

Every pick can't be the next LeBron so just go with the the player that would help you each year and you're ok like Philly. Who hates the Phillies, they just suck and get a lot of draft picks. Leave the playoff junk for the Celtics and Bucks."
lakers,3c43xh,DinoDonkeyDoodle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:05:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I really wish we would've taken Okafor. Good young bigs are rare and hard to come by. I guess management was confident we could get a big in free agency, but now we've obviously come up dry. Why can't the draft be AFTER the first week of free agency when teams actually know what their needs will be?"

Call me skeptical, but I wouldn't bank on us being a contender this year, even if we got LMA. He's going to a better home on the Spurs and we don't have $80m+ to worry about in our salary room.  If you want to try and get a win now, then start rooting for another team. We need more time to rebuild and prove our newbies have what it takes for another superstar to even dream of coming our way. That's just the simple truth of it all. I don't like it, but it is what it is."

lakers,3c5xki,gpholmes1,13,Sun Jul 5 03:26:12 2015 UTC,"Man what's up with all the ""fans"" shitting on this trade? No one is expecting him to be the best center in the league, but he's not 35, hoping for him to return to his all star form is not far fetched or unrealistic."
lakers,3c5xki,GoingBackToMyWays,2,Sun Jul 5 04:42:16 2015 UTC,Exactly. People forget watching the 2013 playoffs where he was very very good!
lakers,3c5xki,Cincybengals7,-2,Sun Jul 5 13:02:37 2015 UTC,"We had to give up a second round pick for the ricpghts to pay a guy whose team no longer wanted him $15 mil (it could be a $17mil cap hit if we have to pay his trade bonus).    Last year the rockets gave us a 1st round pick and $3mil to pay Jeremy Lin's $15mil salary (only $8mil cap hit).   While I don't mind Hibbert and think he'll fit with Randle well, I thought the whole point of taking on a salary dump was to get assets, not give them away"
lakers,3c5xki,_im_on_acid_,3,Sun Jul 5 07:38:05 2015 UTC,"The Lakers gave up a 2 d round pick...  Which isn't much for one of the best defensive centers in the league. On top of that he has a 15 mill expiring which doesn't interfere with future plans...  And on top of that we now we have his bird rights which means next season when everyone goes off the books (except for Russell, Randle, Swaggy unfortunately & Clarkson resigned), the Lakers can sign 2 max FAs and then STILL be able to go over the cap to sign Hibbert to a max deal too if they want. I thought this trade was great."
lakers,3c5xki,babajafar,2,Sun Jul 5 10:04:59 2015 UTC,Why on earth would the Lakers want to max Hibbert?  He sucks.  You do understand Indy just gave him away to us and they expect to be contenders in the E. Conf. next season?
lakers,3c5xki,StealthRUs,2,Sun Jul 5 13:26:43 2015 UTC,"He's not saying they are going to give him the max, he's just saying they could if they wanted/needed to. Right now, Hibbert isn't the best center, but there was a time literally a year ago where he was a top five center. If the Lakers can get that out of him, then we're lucky. If not, oh well, he comes off the books in a year.   Also, Indiana isn't competing for shit next year. They've lost every key player except Hill and George, they have no front court depth, their bench is gone, and their only big signee of the year was Monta Ellis: guard who can score with no defense. There's around 8-9 teams that have a better shot of making the playoffs over the Pacers. This is a salary dump and a tank by them, not a competitive move."
lakers,3c5xki,CoolScales,0,Sun Jul 5 13:36:34 2015 UTC,"He's not saying they are going to give him the max, he's just saying they could if they wanted/needed to.    Why would there ever be a need to max him?   but there was a time literally a year ago where he was a top five center.    Was a time.  I would say it was more like 2 years ago, and it had more to do with the lack of quality centers than him being that good.  Now he's on the decline.     Also, Indiana isn't competing for shit next year. They've lost every key player except Hill and George, they have no front court depth, their bench is gone, and their only big signee of the year was Monta Ellis: guard who can score with no defense.   You just saw that Brooklyn made the playoffs, and they don't have anyone near PG's level on their team.  PG, Hill, and Monta is enough to make the playoffs in the East.  If they were truly tanking, they wouldn't have signed Monta."

lakers,3c5xki,StealthRUs,0,Sun Jul 5 13:28:05 2015 UTC,Who was going to give us picks to take a bad player? Golden State can't give picks until 2019.  What other team was going to give us picks?
lakers,3c5xki,aveydey,0,Sun Jul 5 14:54:04 2015 UTC,"Obviously, the Kings would have, but we didn't do that deal."
lakers,3c5xki,StealthRUs,4,Sun Jul 5 21:07:50 2015 UTC,I think it's just a nice to have. We couldn't tell Ed Davis to chill while we made moves because we didn't have his rights. So when the offer came he took it.
lakers,3c5xki,rebeltrillionaire,3,Sun Jul 5 03:25:28 2015 UTC,"Doesn't have to be a max, if we were to fill our cap with unrestricted FA next year, we could sign him later to go over the cap if it is necessary"

The dude's only 22, and he's been stuck in Charlotte, which is not exactly a bastion for player development. Even if he doesn't ultimately pan out, there's been no rumors of him being any kind of negative influence, so worst case scenario is he takes up a roster slot or we use him to even out salaries in a trade later. But all of this is moot since he's on the Raptors now."

lakers,3c5lt1,likwidsage,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:11:33 2015 UTC,"I think being as good as odom is randle's ceiling i guess. Odom is a really good and versatile player. If randle could be close to what odom used to be id be estatic. Defensively odom got more tools by being longer and leaner, but offensively randle got that potential to be better than odom cause he got that freaky strong body but still veryyyy quick for guys his size"
lakers,3c5lt1,ardyputra027,1 point,Sun Jul 5 16:14:24 2015 UTC,"I think he can be slightly better than odom over his career. He has decent speed, handles and is strong. His wing span is much shorter, but I think he makes it up with his athleticism and power. Anything close to Odom, would be awesome."

lakers,3c5lt1,Incognitary,2,Sun Jul 5 02:12:28 2015 UTC,Russel is great but magic with a jumpshot would hands down be the best point guard ever. Russel can be great but c'mon
lakers,3c5lt1,Billcosbyspuddingpop,-2,Sun Jul 5 02:18:38 2015 UTC,"If everything went well, and Russell hit his absolute celing, he would be the greatest PG ever"
lakers,3c5lt1,swaggerqueen16,11,Sun Jul 5 02:19:56 2015 UTC,Im sorry but no. He has a great ceiling but his ceiling is not the best point guard of all time. Lets settle down a little bit
lakers,3c5lt1,Billcosbyspuddingpop,-3,Sun Jul 5 02:21:04 2015 UTC,"Why not? His passing is the best since magic, he can slash to the rim, and has incredible ball handling skills.  Tbh, he probably wont reach his absolute celing, but if he were, he definitely could be the best."
lakers,3c5lt1,swaggerqueen16,4,Sun Jul 5 02:22:43 2015 UTC,"His passing is great but it isnt the best since magic, c'mon. He can slash to the rim but hes not elite at it nor is he an elite ballhandler. He can improve on all of them and i have a feeling he can be a star in this league but evn if he reached his ceiling he wouldnt be the best ever. His ceiling is high but its not that high. Youre setting yourself up to be very dissapointed"
lakers,3c5lt1,Billcosbyspuddingpop,-6,Sun Jul 5 02:27:23 2015 UTC,"The passing part isn't something I made up, its what I've heard from scouts and reporters for the past 3 months. Hell, even sports science said he was one of the best.   It sounds crazy right now, because he's only 19 and hasn't even played an NBA game yet, but for 19 year olds, his game is pretty polished already. Its like when curry first came into the league, if you were to call him an potential MVP and one of the best point guards ever, and the best shooter ever, people would call you crazy as well.   Its a guesswork right now, but I really think if he were to work on basketball the way Kobe works on his game, he definitely has a shot."
lakers,3c5lt1,swaggerqueen16,6,Sun Jul 5 03:45:59 2015 UTC,His passing is great but there's a difference between a great passer and Magic Johnson. I Will bet you everything I own over the next 20 years of my life that he won't be a top 10 all time player. He's going to be great but you have to be a little realistic. He's 19 and pretty polished but he has some flaws and isn't the once in a generation talent that magic is. He's going to be awesome but if you think he's going to be magic or close to that you're in for a rough time

lakers,3c5lt1,megavino,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:12:10 2015 UTC,I have high hopes for Russell becoming a star. For randle I'm not sure how he'll turn out. Clarkson though he can play I think he's gonna be a solid player. Cant wait to see them next week for summer league.

lakers,3c5lt1,sillymath22,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:07:27 2015 UTC,I've seen a lot of people compare Randle to Randolph but the player I think I see him being closer to is Boozer. He's already decent in the post and is supposed to be a solid rebounder and seems to be developing a mid range game. I see him resembling him more also with his size.

Last season before the injury, his defensive statistics were relatively low - lots of people were criticizing him on this because apparently our defense was better without him on the court. But yeah, Kobe needs to be more of a facilitator and let others shine offensively. This won't necessarily allow us to succeed, but more so to allow our rookies to gain experience, progress their skills, and become comfortable with being the main guys when Kobe leaves."

lakers,3c777b,babymonster69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:29:41 2015 UTC,It's Kobe's last season let him do whatever he wants. Nobody should try to corral Kobe's game. His creativity and decision making is why he's regarded as one of the all-time greats. Also asking a 37 year old Kobe to anchor our defensive is a little too much. We want to see him preform on the offensive end one more time before we have to say goodbye.
lakers,3c6qe2,lemp44,3,Sun Jul 5 10:50:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about letting Johnson go, but I had some other choices for the SF position.  Gerald Green is a slightly underrated guy. He can shoot the three and make highlight plays. I think signing him would bring some much needed excitement to this team. Our current line up doesn't possess any form of spectacular athleticism, so adding someone who can plug that in should help our transition game and help us run more.   No one's gonna agree with this one, but Landry Fields. I loved the guy when he was with the Knicks. He signed a big contract with Toronto a few years back, had a bad injury, and then got relegated to the bench. I think he could help a lot of teams out with his 3 and D style, and I think he'd make an awesome mentor for Anthony Brown. They were both second round picks from Stanford that went to the biggest markets in the NBA. They both also have a similar role for their teams. His stock is low now because of his benching, but that might be the reason we can sign him for cheap."

lakers,3c4ia5,Kbmakaveli,4,Sat Jul 4 20:00:24 2015 UTC,It's not pot....
lakers,3c4ia5,Akvc8,3,Sat Jul 4 21:11:20 2015 UTC,Well at the very least it isn't meth.
lakers,3c4ia5,Lyqu1d,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:15:40 2015 UTC,what drug was it?
lakers,3c4ia5,TheShaggyLion,9,Sun Jul 5 07:51:10 2015 UTC,And that's not even getting into the heart issues/drug problems/other major red flags.  C'mon LakerNation.
lakers,3c4ia5,DaRealDucane,22,Sat Jul 4 18:39:59 2015 UTC,Someone on this sub told me he could easily surpass 4 time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace. I'm not even kidding.
lakers,3c4ia5,Doocane,4,Sat Jul 4 18:45:07 2015 UTC,Good lord.
lakers,3c4ia5,GabrielRodriguez115,7,Sat Jul 4 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"Good because thats not what youre seeing. Dont be stupid. They are signing him because we have no other options and hes the best option out there.  Hes not pur future, Russel is. If upshaw pans out thats great, if he doesnt qho cares we are rebuilding anyway. Quit being spoiled. Any attempt to make is contenders this season will hurt us more than help"
lakers,3c4ia5,Musingmike,2,Sat Jul 4 19:03:13 2015 UTC,"By we I meant the fans, not the organization. Sorry for not being clear."
lakers,3c4rdz,FuckTheClippers,45,Sat Jul 4 19:48:40 2015 UTC,"The CP3 trade fucked us more. It led to the pau gasol drama which undoubtably made us look terrible to other FA's. Couple that with the Dwight drama and here we are. Nash was bad, but definitely worth the gamble."
lakers,3c4rdz,GoingBackToMyWays,15,Sat Jul 4 19:55:00 2015 UTC,"Plus, it led to us trading Lamar Odom when we could have used him."
lakers,3c4rdz,rjvir,19,Sat Jul 4 19:57:29 2015 UTC,"Plus it led to a downward spiral for Lamar Odom's personal life. We're just sports fans, but Lamar, I think we would gladly give one or two lousy seasons just to see Odom have a much happier life."
lakers,3c4rdz,Titanosaurus,11,Sat Jul 4 21:55:26 2015 UTC,"People rip Phil Jackson and ask what he did, I respond with look at Lamar Odom. The instant Lamar was separated from Phil his personal life and basketball play fell apart."
lakers,3c4rdz,Notalent13,3,Sat Jul 4 22:05:32 2015 UTC,"That's beautiful, I never thought nor realized this. As Lamar himself said, ""Coming off the bench gave me my first title."""
lakers,3c4rdz,Titanosaurus,3,Sat Jul 4 22:12:00 2015 UTC,Same thing with Dennis Rodman and Phil.

lakers,3c4rdz,bul1dog,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:14:40 2015 UTC,They didn't have to make that horrible trade. Lamar had a lot more value than a fucking trade exception.

lakers,3c4rdz,StealthRUs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:12:05 2015 UTC,trade exception got us steve nash iirc - hindsight sucks but at the time everyone was happy.
lakers,3c4rdz,Tw1987,8,Sun Jul 5 22:24:31 2015 UTC,The Nash contract was worth the gamble. Not giving up the picks though.
lakers,3c4rdz,ceelogreen5,3,Sat Jul 4 20:50:51 2015 UTC,"This. I hate to blame all our struggles on just one event, but this really started the domino effect. I still think about how life would be if that trade would have went through."
lakers,3c4rdz,Sigsang,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:21:44 2015 UTC,I don't think Pau drama had much to do with free agents at all since we didn't have cap space to go after one.
lakers,3c4rdz,FreshDiamond,9,Sat Jul 4 21:26:19 2015 UTC,"I mean if you want to be historically correct it was the CP3 veto that put us here. Had that gone through CP3 is a Laker, Steve Nash never comes, we keep our pick next year, and Dwight most likely stays as well. We'd be looking at 17 or 18 titles right now if that CP3 trade had gone through."
lakers,3c4rdz,Chilled_Penguin,15,Sat Jul 4 20:24:20 2015 UTC,"He was my favorite PG of all time by that time. I freaking loved him, I was so excited when I read he was coming. David Stern can go fuck himself, I'll never forget this one."
lakers,3c4rdz,Lyqu1d,3,Sat Jul 4 22:14:38 2015 UTC,kobe doesn't tear his achilles either putting the team on his back
lakers,3c4rdz,justgivingsomeadvice,2,Sun Jul 5 01:46:00 2015 UTC,No one could have guess that Nash would have fell apart like he did. Its sad. Worth a gamble for sure but not as bad as CP3
lakers,3c4rdz,VulcanRyu07,5,Sun Jul 5 02:29:42 2015 UTC,Really?  Was this that unexpected?  I expected this shit was gonna happen when it was first announced. Lakers grabbed him at 38 with a history of injuries already. The suns have a legendary medical team that could have prolonged his play slightly longer. The Lakers do not.
lakers,3c4rdz,TyrannosaurusRektus,5,Sat Jul 4 20:02:56 2015 UTC,"No way, everybody was too enamored with the trade to be saying anything negative. We all pictured getting the Nash that played in the 2010 wcf against us"
lakers,3c4rdz,barath_s,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:04:10 2015 UTC,However the injury that killed him as a player was a freak  and new. Just bad luck
lakers,3c4rdz,Unknownchill,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:08:03 2015 UTC,Hey! Steve Nash was not that bad. He might even coach for our rookie guards.
lakers,3c4rdz,Count_Sack_McGee,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:03:53 2015 UTC,I didn't think we'd be this bad but I did feel like the only person in the world that didn't like the Nash acquisition.  All my friends and my dad thought it was the greatest thing ever. He was a broken down PG who we were paying quite a bit.  This is one time when I wished I was wrong.
lakers,3c4rdz,steve_n_doug_boutabi,0,Sun Jul 5 04:23:58 2015 UTC,"Don't forget the rule of 3's and I'd say our strikes were: The CP3 trade, hiring mike brown over phil and howard drama."
lakers,3c4rdz,Lyqu1d,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:01:01 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, coach wise the choice for D'Antoni was even more fucked up then Mike Brown. It was a complete disgrace for our franchise. I still don't understand what our FO was thinking when they decided that would be a good idea."
lakers,3c4rdz,steve_n_doug_boutabi,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:55:39 2015 UTC,IMO that stems back to jerry buss passing away and how his son wasn't and still isnt up to running this organization

lakers,3c5koc,kerby720,5,Sun Jul 5 00:41:01 2015 UTC,I like that sign and trade with NY.
lakers,3c5koc,aveydey,2,Sun Jul 5 00:54:06 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, they're both unrestricted free agents, so there is no reason for them or the teams who sign them to do a S&T."
lakers,3c5koc,blacKCastle32,3,Sun Jul 5 01:08:39 2015 UTC,"You're right, they can be signed outright without S&T, but I think Knicks and Rockets are over the cap, so the Lakers can use their bird rights to sign the players, and those teams just send over players to offset the salary being used to sign Lin and Hill. If Lin or Hill wants to play for those teams."
lakers,3c5koc,jaysteezy24,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:20:59 2015 UTC,They can save cap space by paying a little more over five years. Something Hill might be interested in. Depends on if he thinks he will be able to get another contract four years from now.

lakers,3c4u9t,rheeddiddi,3,Sat Jul 4 20:38:27 2015 UTC,"I think it would be something like Lin to Dallas, Ellis to pacers, and Hibbert to Lakers with possibly Felton put in there"

lakers,3c4u9t,AaronOG,3,Sat Jul 4 21:13:03 2015 UTC,only if the pacers give us a 1st rounder. hibbert makes us 5 games better which will probably just mess up our tank.

lakers,3c4u9t,AaronOG,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:32:58 2015 UTC,We are $23 million under the cap. He can be absorbed. I'd be ecstatic if we could throw Nick Young into the mix.
lakers,3c4u9t,misterrunon,9,Sun Jul 5 00:07:56 2015 UTC,"I've been hoping for this. I think he's underrated, personally. He had some bad games, but he's still young. I think 15 mil is his salary and seeing as we have plenty of money after free agency this year, we should take a shot. Who knows, if he has a good year, he can develop something with these young guys and stay as at least the back up in the coming years."
lakers,3c4u9t,DarkNightsWatch,2,Sat Jul 4 20:38:46 2015 UTC,"This is a great time to capitalize on picking up Hibbert while his value is low. If he plays well, Lakers have all the leverage in the world during the summer."
lakers,3c4u9t,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:42:54 2015 UTC,Totally agree. He's just not a number one option type player. More like a number 3 option at best.
lakers,3c4u9t,rheeddiddi,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:41:52 2015 UTC,"He's probably a ""no option"" type player. All he can do is play defense. He can't really finish around the rim or do anything. He's a strange player.. slow as hell, uncoordinated, but he can play defense."
lakers,3c4u9t,misterrunon,3,Sun Jul 5 00:07:24 2015 UTC,good call bruh
lakers,3c4u9t,jordanthejordna,2,Sun Jul 5 01:28:12 2015 UTC,Sure of the Pacers hand over a pick.
lakers,3c4u9t,SantaMariaD17,2,Sat Jul 4 20:35:30 2015 UTC,I would love to see the Lakers bring in Hibbert. Great rim protector at a decent price

lakers,3c7t4q,Buckelroo,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:31:22 2015 UTC,"Why would Cousins leave when the Kings drafted well and made good moves this free agency to put pieces around him? And I hate to break it to you, but our FO isn't that attractive right now. Jeanie and Jim are openly at ends with one another. In two years, Jim is supposed to step down, but what if he doesn't? Jeanie is going to have to decide whether or not to fire her own brother. That will result in some crazy media storm around the Lakers. That's the type of drama Cousins would be smart to avoid like a plague. There is not savior coming until our rookies can build the foundation."
lakers,3c7t4q,Buckelroo,2,Sun Jul 5 18:38:14 2015 UTC,It's a horribly run organization and you can bet he will leave after his contract is up in 3 years.  I think Hibbert and a Randle or Clarkson makes them think a little bit.  It's still the Lakers and if Russell pans out they become a lot more attractive.....Have you seen all the drama currently going on around the Kings organization for the last month or so?
lakers,3c7t4q,Titan67,0,Sun Jul 5 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"The drama was centered around George Karl shopping Cousins around without the FO's permission. Since Vlade Divac cracked the whip things have settled down. Rudy, Cousins, and the FO are all ready to move forward. Their moves this off-season are evidence of that. The worst thing that can possible happen is that they let George Karl go, and if they were going to do that, they would have already done it. Sacramento isn't as messed up as you think it is."
lakers,3c7t4q,Theingloriousak2,0,Sun Jul 5 18:49:04 2015 UTC,"I don't get it....I'm pretty sure this whole 'Jim Buss stepping down in a few years talk' CAME FROM JIM BUSS himself. Why are people assuming there's drama btw Jim and Jeanie? And I'll wait and see how the Kings do, Rondo there will be boom or bust, no middle ground."
lakers,3c7t4q,p0se1d0n,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:51:40 2015 UTC,You could eat a contract with his 15 mil expiring  so just in that way he's in asset  If he plays up to his per 36 he will be even more of one
lakers,3c7t4q,BuyAllTheVowels,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:42:34 2015 UTC,"agree, that's my point"
lakers,3c7t4q,NicDwolfwood,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:43:39 2015 UTC,"Sacramento's FO has done everything to appease Cousins thus far, short of firing Karl.  They got him the PG he wanted (Rondo) and they acquired a center so he can go back playing the PF position.  Also the ownership in Sacto is much more stable then with the inept Jeanie and Jim.  Sad but true"
lakers,3c7t4q,FreshDiamond,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:53:08 2015 UTC,"Huh? The Kings easily have the worst owner in the league who has no clue what he is doing.  They hired Vlade who has no front office experience and raised eyebrows everywhere when he was hired.....  Jim Buss was there when the CP3 trade was nixed, not his fault..."
lakers,3c7t4q,spudwinkle,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:44:57 2015 UTC,I think the rule is once you trade for a player you can't package him in a trade for another player. He can be traded by himself but I'm pretty sure Sac isn't agreeing to that.

lakers,3c6967,Lemonsforu,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:05:01 2015 UTC,Foreal they hyping them up too much. Matthews might not even be the same player. Also lin might not even go there for 1 year.
lakers,3c6967,aveydey,0,Sun Jul 5 07:37:03 2015 UTC,No Lin please. Let him go to Dallas and take his fans with him.
lakers,3c6967,harryhov,2,Sun Jul 5 14:57:22 2015 UTC,Yes but I doubt they would want to take on any commitment beyond this year. I think Wes Johnson would really flourish with D'Angelo running point.
lakers,3c6967,spudwinkle,2,Sun Jul 5 05:52:20 2015 UTC,i'm all for it then!    sign them all to good 1 year contracts. this team probably wont make the playoffs but will be competitive
lakers,3c6967,Honest_Joseph,1 point,Sun Jul 5 05:54:04 2015 UTC,"Wes really needs to change his game up and become consistent, too much talent and athleticism that isn't reaching its peak."
lakers,3c6967,jaysteezy24,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:53:24 2015 UTC,We only have bird rights on Lin. The player has to come off at least a 3 year contract for bird rights.
lakers,3c6967,StealthRUs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:48:41 2015 UTC,wesley johnson has early bird rights?
lakers,3c6967,FreshDiamond,1 point,Sun Jul 5 07:05:36 2015 UTC,"I really don't see the point in bringing Wesley and Hill back, maybe Lin if he accepts playing about 15mins a game, but he won't because teams like Dallas are offering him a better position with more playing time and opportunity to succeed. You have to remember these are the same guys we've been playing with and have been losing with. Jordan Hill improved his jumper, but then he fail in love with it so much that he stopped doing what he had always done best in the past which was just be the energy garbage man, and his defensive ability was always suspect. We now have Tarik Black to replace what Hill did for us at a much cheaper value. Wesley Johnson is just not good simple as that. Way too inconsistent, can jump out of the gym but chooses not to cut or slash to the rim. He has all the tools to be a great 3 and D player for us, but he just never seem to have got it. I would rather give the opportunity to another player."
lakers,3c50df,UrbanRaptor,2,Sat Jul 4 21:10:54 2015 UTC,"Among other things, it has a lot to do with the SportVU cameras that have recently been installed in all arenas. At first teams had to pay six-figures to have the cams installed, lakers obviously not being one of those teams. They are in every stadium now, though the lakers have been reported to be slow in effectively using any of the data that is available. The cameras do an amazing job of providing an almost limitless amount of data on every single player on the floor.  Here is a link to sportvu on ESPN http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/"
lakers,3c50df,poops__everywhere,5,Sat Jul 4 21:19:32 2015 UTC,"I will go even further to say that if the Lakers don't strengthen their analytics department (do they even have one? Mark Madsen? lol), they will continue to not only lose out on every single big FA signing, but also continue to be uncompetitive on the basketball floor. ""Come to LA we have movie stars here"" is laughable in today's NBA market."
lakers,3c50df,poops__everywhere,5,Sat Jul 4 21:29:04 2015 UTC,analytics is just advanced statistics and tracking. It applies to sports VU tracking but also where people shoot on the floor such as showing that a 3 is way more valuable than a long 2. Also shows how the 2 most important shots are corner 3s and layups.
lakers,3c2n3d,hobojarpen,43,Sat Jul 4 04:42:04 2015 UTC,"Couple of things that stood out:   Upshaw talking about being confident he'll be on the Lakers roster come opening night How emotional/appreciative/real he sounded about getting a Summer League opportunity, being grateful about getting a chance with the Lakers How excited he is to take on Towns and Okafor in the first two Summer League games"
lakers,3c2n3d,harryhov,23,Sat Jul 4 04:44:27 2015 UTC,Only silver lining aside from D'Angelo. I really hope he comes in and becomes a beast.
lakers,3c2n3d,TuneHD,5,Sat Jul 4 04:48:19 2015 UTC,"I hope A Brown can come out as a good 3&D guy, he seems like a guy who really knows his role. His press conference interview and his workout interview left good impression on me."

lakers,3c2n3d,harryhov,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:34:01 2015 UTC,Yeah.. sorry I wasn't clear. I think best is to just expect the worst next summer FA and hope something comes out lol.
lakers,3c2n3d,Buckelroo,20,Sat Jul 4 17:37:01 2015 UTC,"WHAT A FUCKING GUY. My god, I'm so glad I listened  to that."
lakers,3c2n3d,ByTheBeardOfBruce,14,Sat Jul 4 05:10:58 2015 UTC,"wow, I was so wrong about this guy. Damn, that's some powerful stuff right there. Glad to have him on the team"
lakers,3c2n3d,mrspacemein,13,Sat Jul 4 05:47:26 2015 UTC,"Man, listening to that made me like the guy so much more. I don't get any sense that this guy would make a bad presence in our locker room. He sounds like he honestly has learned from his mistakes, and is ready to go kick some ass on the court."
lakers,3c2n3d,aveydey,19,Sat Jul 4 05:41:46 2015 UTC,Imagine that we were able to draft both Okafor and Russell this summer?  That's exactly what Mitch did by getting Upshaw.  Fuck the shitty class of free agent centers this summer.  This guy is going to be awesome.  Count on it.
lakers,3c2n3d,thelakesh0w,10,Sat Jul 4 06:06:02 2015 UTC,why does it sound like he's crying while talking?
lakers,3c2n3d,ElementShield,19,Sat Jul 4 06:00:59 2015 UTC,He is just emotional about his past.
lakers,3c2n3d,darkshark21,6,Sat Jul 4 06:14:59 2015 UTC,Happy to have an opportunity after getting kicked off two college programs.
lakers,3c2n3d,harryhov,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:04:39 2015 UTC,"I wasnt aware he was red-flagged by the NBA for a possible heart condition. If he really turns out to be a beast on a court, Lakers really lucked out."
lakers,3c2n3d,zunick,9,Sat Jul 4 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"WOW. He is such a well spoken guy and he seems so humbled to have this opportunity. I would absolutely love for him to go from undrafted to one of the best defensive bigs in a few years and show how far he has come. What a guy. :,)"
lakers,3c2n3d,fungdamental,6,Sat Jul 4 07:00:47 2015 UTC,This guy could have a gobert-like emergence next couple of years if lakers dont sign bigs so he gets playing time and he stays focused and works
lakers,3c2n3d,TimeisIllmatic95,9,Sat Jul 4 07:18:46 2015 UTC,I think he's gonna be better than Gobert as far as overall skill.
lakers,3c2n3d,TimeisIllmatic95,6,Sat Jul 4 08:07:19 2015 UTC,He's about to dominate Towns and Okafor in the Summer League.
lakers,3c2n3d,egoisillusion,7,Sat Jul 4 08:15:52 2015 UTC,If he can stay clean and work hard he has the tools to be one of the best defensive centers in the league. Let's hope he can get and stay connected to the right people in his life.
lakers,3c2n3d,itsyourdestini,5,Sat Jul 4 10:39:56 2015 UTC,HE NEEDS TO MAKE IT!!! I AM HIS NUMBER 1 FAN
lakers,3c2n3d,teo1315,2,Sat Jul 4 07:48:57 2015 UTC,I'm fucking hyped for this guy
lakers,3c2n3d,Titanosaurus,5,Sat Jul 4 10:21:17 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind. Deandre Jordan is a 2nd round draft pick, and he's being courted with max deals before going to Dallas. There's gold in the second roubd!"
lakers,3c2n3d,SPMrFantastic,3,Sat Jul 4 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"I love his potential, hate that he had a beast of a game against my school"

lakers,3c2n3d,Tekdepledj,3,Sat Jul 4 11:14:48 2015 UTC,I cannot wait until summer league. We get to see D'lo play for the first time on the nba level. We get to see how Julius Randle has improved his game. And now I'm really curious to see if Upshaw is as good as he was projected before all of the off the court issues.  i love watching summer league anyway but this is gonna make things so much more interesting
lakers,3c2n3d,mister_greyMATTER,2,Sat Jul 4 16:04:48 2015 UTC,"I'm ready to watch this dude grow and dominate the paint. Make it happen, front office."
lakers,3c2n3d,djSexPanther,2,Sat Jul 4 08:58:57 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what the song is that starts playing when Upshaw first starts talking? It's super familiar and I'm kicking myself for not being able to place it.
lakers,3c2n3d,LA0834,3,Sat Jul 4 14:50:00 2015 UTC,"NBA on TNT theme song. I was waiting for Ernie, Kenny, Charles and Shaq to start talking haha."
lakers,3c2n3d,ferociouspandas,2,Sat Jul 4 15:39:34 2015 UTC,It's the song from the first Jurassic Park movie.
lakers,3c2n3d,djSexPanther,3,Sat Jul 4 15:18:54 2015 UTC,Ah yes. It's because he's a shot blocking pterodactyl. Thanks.
lakers,3c2n3d,TuneHD,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:32:25 2015 UTC,I hope he's our Whiteside that becomes a diamond in the rough.
lakers,3c2oxn,polvitos,24,Sat Jul 4 05:04:01 2015 UTC,I'm in. Dude looks like he's got a nice stroke too.
lakers,3c2oxn,megavino,10,Sat Jul 4 05:27:30 2015 UTC,That surprised me. Hopefully he makes the roster and gets a days workout with Kareem.
lakers,3c2oxn,Havok-Devastator,8,Sat Jul 4 06:00:43 2015 UTC,"I've watched and followed his career for a decent time now. He's honestly the next Royce White more so than Hassan Whiteside. His motor is relatively low for a big. He's not an above the rim player, dispute what a highlight reel might lead you to think. Can't seem to handle/understand inticacies of organized basketball (and I mean the sheer basics, not anything too remotely advanced relative to all other rookies). Basically without sounding like I'm a Debbie downer, he's as raw a prospect as one can get. He doesn't belong on an NBA team as a starter yet or even as a major bench contributor. It's going to be very interesting how he fairs in summer league, but based on literally following this guy for the last 2 1/2 years, chances are he's not going to make any NBA roster.  Before people accuse me of some sort of blind hate towards the guy, Let me just say it really isn't. I no longer live around LA but I def see myself as a fan still, even while working elsewhere. A lot of you guys are overwhelming unhappy about this FA process (rightly so), but are also putting blind faith in a VERY questionable player. Everything I've said is just on the basketball side of things. This guy has been kicked off two major school programs for various infractions/mishaps. It is not solely bud/weed related. He has extreme red flags that the entire league/scouts are well aware of. I hate to use the term arm chair GM but that's what we are doing by expecting this guy to be just great. I know its unpopular opinion but I really feel like someone has to be the dissenting voice. Obviously I hope I'm dead wrong/eat crow as he morphs into an All Star and succeed on the team but beyond that, it's all just a lot of hoping rather than waiting from my pov."
lakers,3c2oxn,L075,5,Sat Jul 4 09:54:35 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I actually remember Royce White to be a good prospect basketball-wise. He's multi-skilled, definitely a good passer, which would be difficult to showcase if he didn't know the plays and offball movement. Raw is a player like Lavine/Oubre/Tony Mitchell, who can't do much right now, but got drafted for what they can become. Upshaw has an elite skill right now which is really valuable, rim protection."
lakers,3c2oxn,dissphemism,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:23:29 2015 UTC,"Raw is a player like Lavine/Oubre/Tony Mitchell, who can't do much right now, but got drafted for what they can become.     Agreed. If we're going to call Upshaw raw talent, then it shouldn't be considered such a bad thing.   Upshaw has an elite skill right now which is really valuable, rim protection.     This is a key factor as well."
lakers,3c2oxn,mister_greyMATTER,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:44:04 2015 UTC,"Oh, I solely meant Royce White as a reference of someone who looked great but turned out to be not ready for the league. In essence, I wasn't comparing their skill sets per se since once is a wing and another a legit big. I meant more so their relevance to a team since White was pretty much hyped up to be a lottery ticket for teams willing to gamble on him, much like Upshaw is now. White's off the court issues has hampered a first round talent like him, and those are 'mild' compared to the issues Upshaw is reportedly shown to have. Just my 2 cents.   White as you stated was really talented. There is no doubt he showed out his skill set a variety of times. I guess I was confusing to compare a wing to a big, but only so in terms of their situations."
lakers,3c2oxn,L075,2,Sat Jul 4 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you. He's an exciting prospect, and he might pan out, but I'm not betting the future of the premier NBA franchise on an undrafted center. Sorry."
lakers,3c2oxn,ohsemantics,2,Sat Jul 4 15:02:40 2015 UTC,He shot 43% from the free throw line in college..

lakers,3c5bht,tragikkBronson,9,Sat Jul 4 23:01:26 2015 UTC,He had a bad year and people hate him now. Much like JR smith the past couple years.
lakers,3c5bht,DeangeloRussell,7,Sat Jul 4 23:12:37 2015 UTC,He just needs to refocus - he had quite a bit off the court drama... sadly the mrs. created most of it. His season before was crazy good and he was the player we all were watching. hopefully he comes back with better intensity to show the youngin's what's up.
lakers,3c5bht,spudwinkle,2,Sat Jul 4 23:37:47 2015 UTC,"I'm cool with keeping him. A lot of people want him traded, but his contract isn't that big and he's a decent bench player for what he's getting paid. He was in talks for 6MOTY a couple years ago too."
lakers,3c5bht,kx2UPP,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:17:18 2015 UTC,Wrong he had a good year and people loved him. Then the real nick young showed up. He is a below average basketball player with a huge ego. He would have been out of the league if he didn't take the minimum with the lakers 2 years ago. He got his new deal because he was a fan favorite and we were tanking
lakers,3c5bht,FreshDiamond,14,Sun Jul 5 22:12:41 2015 UTC,"He had a really good year under D'Antoni season his first year, then last season he got injured and shot terribly. To be honest, I don't get hate towards him but this season will decide if he has a future here."
lakers,3c5bht,AaronOG,-1,Sat Jul 4 23:06:13 2015 UTC,the hate is because he was coming late to practices after he got paid that's completely unacceptable IMO.
lakers,3c5bht,rejectx,4,Sat Jul 4 23:23:38 2015 UTC,"Nothing. He is what he is, a volume shooter who provides offense off the bench but not much defense and can get hot at any given moment and go off. I think people are enamored with having maximum cap space for some reason and he's pretty much the only long term contract other than Randle and Russell. Also, some are turned off by his aloof attitude and question his commitment to the team and getting better as a player."
lakers,3c5bht,KaosAlpha,3,Sat Jul 4 23:13:49 2015 UTC,Doctors say it's a rare disease called the Iggys
lakers,3c5bht,Symphonia1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:31:22 2015 UTC,"He's an overpaid inefficient scorer off the bench. He literally does nothing else on the floor, not a good defender, doesn't assist much and doesn't get others involved, doesn't rebound well for his height (6'7). He shoots 37% from the field because he just chucks bad shots up repeatedly without thinking. To put it in perspective, JR. Smith even in NY was shooting 40 percent from the field. Lastly, he's too entranced in LA spotligt as opposed to winning. He doesn't play to win, more so to get paid and have fun. After he got his contract his work ethic just died - came to practice late, etc."
lakers,3c5bht,ss3happy1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:29:09 2015 UTC,this right here
lakers,3c5bht,Vapology_Story,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:28:53 2015 UTC,He's a Hollywood JR Smith.  Useful in the right system (Pringles) but relegated to an off-the-bench volume scorer or a distraction if placed in the wrong one (right now)
lakers,3c5bht,jon_snow_jones,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:20:50 2015 UTC,No idea.  He makes 5 million a year to be a microwave player.   He had a bad year but he's far from being the one reason why the Lakers haven't been competitive plus he's a fun character and brings a little light heartedness to the team.     Laker fans just needed a scapegoat.
lakers,3c5bht,LowkeyAnushole,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:13:25 2015 UTC,The problem with Nick Young is he's not very good.  He's a high volume shooter similar to J.R. Smith without all the negative antics.  He's also not at good as J.R. Smith....
lakers,3c5bht,jmg2023,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:39:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anything wrong with him per se; He is what he is: a volume shooter, often inefficient, doesn't play much defense.  However, when focused, he could -- and is! -- an exciting player that adds a bit of spark to the game. I think injuries derailed his focus last season coupled with the poor play of the team overall. I think that attitude turned off a lot of fans.  My hope is that we'll see Swaggy P bounce back a bit this season and feel healthy and rejuvenated and inspired by the new additions to the team, etc."

Dating Iggy Azalea (which is a whole other issue), likely does help due to him being in the lime light way more often then he would be if he were just simply a player for the Los Angeles Lakers. If the dude couldn't get buckets, he would have been gone a while ago."
lakers,3c5s0x,fudmuffin,19,Sun Jul 5 02:10:52 2015 UTC,"I found it HILARIOUS how some of you turn your nose at this trade, we got him for nothing!!! an all star center for nothing!! We missed out on LMA and DJ and Mitch got off his ass and got us an elite rim defender, all of you were crying when we were going to go with Okafor and said it wouldnt work because he cant play D! Im very happy with this trade, hope he bounces back this year"
lakers,3c5s0x,starfoxer,3,Sun Jul 5 02:23:26 2015 UTC,"Hope youre not talking about me(the OP).  I like Hibby.  Honestly Im not even mad that Lakers didnt made a splash in Free agency.  Gasol and LMA are 30 years old.  K-Love is such a liability on defense.  Robin Lopez isnt worth is 54M contract.  I resent not getting DeAndre Jordan, but otherwise getting Hibby as a fallback option isnt bad at all!"
lakers,3c5s0x,starfoxer,3,Sun Jul 5 02:42:06 2015 UTC,"No sorry that wasn't towards you at all, It was a general statement. Not bad what so ever. We have a anchor for the defense"
lakers,3c5s0x,GoingBackToMyWays,5,Sun Jul 5 02:49:33 2015 UTC,no worries. in all honesty i think people are spoiled where they wanna see a quick fix and have the lakers be in the nba finals next year. i think hibby can be good with coach scott. plays his brand of ball.
lakers,3c5s0x,MikeMcNorv,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:58:30 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing the people complaining are the ones who honestly thought we were getting love, Aldridge, rondo and lebron. Otherwise, I really don't see why anyone would oppose this. Best case scenario we found our starting center for the next four to five years, worst case scenario we lost a couple of second round picks that odds were wont turn out a good player."
lakers,3c5s0x,starfoxer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 06:32:30 2015 UTC,"Hibbert is better than any center out there. But don't say they got him for nothing. The Lakers need draft picks, even if it's a 2nd rounder, there's no other way for them to get talent."

lakers,3c5s0x,BuyAllTheVowels,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:15:53 2015 UTC,It will probably be pretty easy to buy a 2nd round pick straight up in the next couple years because 2/3 of them are owned by the 76ers and celtics
lakers,3c5s0x,nikkus,3,Sun Jul 5 06:08:26 2015 UTC,Yes. All he'll be asked to do is play D and guard the paint. If he wants to earn another contract he'll have to do it.   Also expecting a lot of 1-4 pick and roll/pops with Randle and our guards. That's going to be a lot of fun.   Roy's exactly what we needed and it's great the Lakers didn't have to sign anyone long term or overpay to get it.
lakers,3c5s0x,Scabandiri,2,Sun Jul 5 02:25:02 2015 UTC,Yep. He's gonna be our defensive anchor and won't demand the ball on the offensive end.

He wanted the ball all the time in the post in Indiana and would whine a lot talking wise, publicly and physical gestures on the court.

lakers,3c4dpv,aeisenst,14,Sat Jul 4 17:44:36 2015 UTC,"the brian windhorst interview on Colin Cowherd's show scared the hell out of me. When pushed as to why they didn't discuss analytics in the LMA meeting, Mitch Kupchak apparently said, ""We weren't very good last year. I'm not sure what looking at the statistics would have proven.""  A fundamental misunderstanding of the difference between stats and analytics from the GM is kind of scary. LMA didn't want to see fucking stats. He wanted to know how his style of play at the 4 was going to fit in with the team's strengths and weaknesses. He wanted to see numbers on how and where the Lakers get their points. He wanted SMART numbers, not a fucking stat sheet.   /rant."
lakers,3c4dpv,agentfox,6,Sat Jul 4 18:12:16 2015 UTC,To be fair what were we going to propose? How he would fit in with players that won't even be on our roster this coming year? Kobe barely played and we are barely retaining our players. It makes more sense to sell him on the future and the roadmap we plan to take once we sign him. I'm sure the story was around building around LA but LA took a safer route with the Spurs end of story
lakers,3c4dpv,santokimilktea,3,Sat Jul 4 19:14:52 2015 UTC,It didn't make sense to put so much effort into selling him anything when the precedent of stars moving to better situations had already been set. You can't sell a 30 year old star on hope for the future.

lakers,3c4dpv,readem_n_weep,0,Sat Jul 4 18:51:06 2015 UTC,"I mean Mitch is right.     They don't have stats on Randle or D'Angelo, no way to tell how Kobe will play and how long he'll play,   numbers show that Clarkson projects to be a decent starter(unless he experiences another jump in growth) the preferred positron for Aldridge is already occupied by Randle so either we move Aldridge to the 5 (which he hates) or move Randle to the bench(which stunts his growth and/or weakens the starting line-up) and we're coming off of the historically worst season in franchise history.    The Lakers could have definitely put up a chart or analysis spelling all that out but that's not typically how you get free agents.  Now after we get some wins, some growth and some cohesion this upcoming season, we can break out formulas, analytics and presentations but this off season, outside of the Knicks who will have a healthy superstar player, we were by far the worst team in the hunt for a major free agent, which would be a reason we didn't break out any analytics."

For instance, the Houston Rockets are in love with advanced stats and they are said to be a big part of the Rockets' success. I don't know about you, but I don't need analytics to tell me a team with James Harden, Dwight Howard, and Josh Smith is gonna be good. They just got the best players available that isn't analytics at all lmao"
lakers,3c4dpv,ACPhila,-1,Sun Jul 5 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"Josh Smith is horrible and analytics will tell you that. They took a chance on him because it was for next to nothing and Howard's best friend. Its not just for free agency, its for the draft. Theres a reason why the spurs almost always hit on players and why other teams whiff. Its just a state of denial for the Lakers. It works and its beating them.  EDIT: you know whos one of the biggest analytics minds in the NBA? Jerry West.  Im a sixer fan and wanted Russell so badly and was pissed you guys took him because...analytics said he was going to be a superstar. He can shoot 3's and is a great passer and can score in the paint. You guys have a great prospect dont screw it up to sign overpriced FA's who probably wont fit and then its a repeat of Howard and Kobe again."

Aldridge went to the obviously better situation... the better team with the best PF ever, the best Euro point guard ever, the best South American player ever, fantastic supporting cast with one of the best breakout players in the league, the best coach in the league, no state taxes, and it's his home state.   What do the Lakers have to offer to someone that doesn't have a risk taking personality? Absurd media pressure? Fans that heap praise and scorn in equal measure at the smallest opportunity? A season or two rebuilding for someone on the wrong side of 30?   Anyone that thought he was ever going anywhere but San Antonio are fucking delusional."

Please don't forget that the FO almost pulled off one of the most devious trades that would have set the franchise up for years of success. Fortunately all the stars were aligned for that move, but Stern didn't let it happen. Aggressively going after Cousins was such a reassuring move because it shows that the FO knows what type of players will equate to success. The Lakers right now are doing what the best teams in the NBA (Spurs, OKC, Warriors) have done, build through the draft. Sure a LMA or DJ would be good additions, but neither will get you a ring. Be patient homies, LA sports always find a way to turn themselves around."

It's almost an assumption the Lakers are a playoff team every year at this point. A reminder that it was only 5 years ago that we won a championship.  Just to put this situation into perspective, look at the shit other team's fan base had to live through in the last decade. look at teams like the Raps, Twolves, even the fking Clips pre-Blake. Their fan base have suffered years after years of mediocrity and losing seasons, how many losing seasons we've suffered so far? Two.

The winning means more and feels better when you have gone through the bad seasons and stick by your team through it all. Its always the same story...""are the Lakers done?"" ""is this the end of the Lakers as we know them?"" blah blah blah a few years later they are back in the finals and everyone forgets the bad crap we had to go through to get back on top. This is no different. If I had to sit through Anthony Peeler, Elden Campbell,  and Nick van Exel (and dont take me wrong, i absolutely loved those squads too, cuz, you know, loyalty) in between 5 chips with Magic and then 5 chips with Kobe, you all can spend a few seasons watching the Jordan Hill, Nick Young, Robert Sacre Lakers in between Kobe and whover the next great Laker we have the PRIVLEGE to witness......"

I've been avidly reading this subreddit over the last year (and especially with the onset of free agency) and I have to categorically disagree with your sentiments.  From my perspective, and I hope from others', the point of forums is to discuss, analyze and debate. Consequently, posters should not be criticized for opining about the FO. I enjoy reading people's opinions on what to do, who to sign, etc. I enjoy scrolling through the discussion and following debates. I like reading comments people make about max-ing LMA or Monroe. Comments supporting the FO and comments criticizing the FO have had their issues. Some of them are superficial and others are extremely insightful. Whats the point of a forum if we cant read interesting debates and inform ourselves about different opinions than the ones we hold?  Furthermore, the offseason and sports in general would be quite boring if we all said ""the FO has been one of the best in the league, so lets just celebrate everything they do and never criticize them."" That seems silly and would ultimately lead to a very boring forum. It's fun to put ourselves in Kupchak's shoes and think about the direction of the team. We are fans, after all, and that's what fans do.  I just want to add that calling people spoiled and accusing them of not understanding what rebuilding means is not the way to change minds."

The Lakers just finished 40 games below .500 and as of right now, their roster looks awful. Not saying it's not ultimately for the best, but just try to keep in mind that these last couple years have been filled with disappointment and frustration, and we are in for another awful season where we might not even keep our pick...."
lakers,3c1411,ss3happy1,14,Fri Jul 3 21:05:44 2015 UTC,It's just disappointing to see the front office do absolutely nothing
lakers,3c1411,WOX_69,20,Fri Jul 3 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"We've had multiple interviews with some of the biggest free agents. I'm sorry did you want to sign Tyson Chandler to a 52 mil 4 year deal? I sure as hell don't, lets keep our options open for trades or next years FA. Lakers swing for the fences its all or nothing, I guarantee in the next year or two we make at least 2 huge signings or trades that will bring us back to prominence."
lakers,3c1411,WOX_69,9,Fri Jul 3 20:25:08 2015 UTC,"Lakers swing for the fences its all or nothing   Exactly. This summer, the result has been ""nothing"", and I'm disappointed by that."
lakers,3c1411,WOX_69,14,Fri Jul 3 20:28:32 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed we didn't get LMA or DJ too, but I'm not gonna rag on the FO or my team. It's ultimately the players decision, can't say we didn't try."
lakers,3c1411,wartodas,11,Fri Jul 3 20:32:22 2015 UTC,Except we shouldn't have been chasing them. It was clear from the beginning we weren't getting ANY of the top tier free agents. Instead we wasted our time and missed out on some great mid range players. We let Ed Davis walk for less than what he was asking for because we wanted to keep space open for LMA. If that isn't embarrassing for a front office I don't know what is.
lakers,3c1411,WOX_69,2,Fri Jul 3 22:00:13 2015 UTC,"We have Tarik so I'm not really upset about Davis leaving. Maybe facilitate a sign and trade, but other than that that didn't really hurt us."
lakers,3c1411,wartodas,-2,Sat Jul 4 03:31:06 2015 UTC,How was that clear? We were in consideration for all of them. Not exactly the front runners but not completely out of the picture. I would have liked to re-sign Ed to but obviously FO didn't see him in our future plans. But it sounds like we should put you in FO cause you got it all figured out.
lakers,3c1411,WOX_69,3,Fri Jul 3 22:27:27 2015 UTC,"The FO put the Lakers in this terrible situation because of a series of bad decisions. They need to be criticized for giving Kobe a ridiculous contract that is destroying our Cap. Because of this, we don't have space for 2 Max guys this summer. Contrary to popular belief, next year's FA class is not that good (except for KD). Ppl are upset for a reason, you don't have to be condescending."
lakers,3c1411,njain4,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:09:42 2015 UTC,The only bad decision was the Kobe contract. Everything else was a great idea at the time. Hindsight is 20/20.
lakers,3c1411,avanhokie,2,Sat Jul 4 04:53:21 2015 UTC,Please explain how we had any shot at any of these guys. Already every single report from the meeting we had say the players weren't impressed.
lakers,3c1411,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:44:37 2015 UTC,"Do you believe everything you read on the internet? LMA wasn't impressed, so unimpressed he had a second meeting with us. I'm not saying were going to sign him and I doubt we are but our FO is trying. You want us just to sign anyone just for the sake of signing someone? We should have signed Ed Davis I agree, but we also avoided overpaying mediocre players."
lakers,3c1411,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Sat Jul 4 01:50:04 2015 UTC,"But think, what were we really going to do with LMA in the long run?"
lakers,3c1411,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Sat Jul 4 03:31:34 2015 UTC,"Westcoat, I completely agree we as Laker fans are spoiled. But at the same time, this off season was a disaster, not because we didn't get anyone - but because it was so scathing to realize that no one wanted to play on the Lakers. We had 23 million in cap - and we literally have put none of that to good use. This strips our fan base of hope because even with CAP we weren't able to do anything, so what's next? Our only hopes are on rookies now, something Laker fans aren't accustomed to. Overall, we are spoiled. But the Laker FO have done an outstandingly bad job this summer, not taking advantage of a key cap year to steal some good players (or even some role players) under the current CBA. Other teams will now have an advantage going forward, with their stars on cheaper contracts, so they can add more talent. Lakers FO has also shown to lack in analytics and recruiting staff - something that is to be expected in this decade of basketball. So now, even with tremendous cap next season Lakers have to revamp their FO before thinking about how to use that. We were too accustomed to success...but now the situation is looking gloom - which is why Laker fans are worried."
lakers,3c1411,WOX_69,-8,Sat Jul 4 03:45:29 2015 UTC,can't say we didn't try   We halfheartedly tried to sign only three players

lakers,3c1411,justsomeguy5,2,Sat Jul 4 03:29:24 2015 UTC,But what did you realistically expect them to do? There were no moves there were going to put us in contention.
lakers,3c1411,bmamba2942,2,Sat Jul 4 03:26:41 2015 UTC,But we could have attempted to sign players that would entice stars to play here in 2016. Now we have to hope that Russell's the Rookie of the Year just to get players interested in coming here
lakers,3c1411,thelakesh0w,2,Sat Jul 4 03:32:22 2015 UTC,"And promoting the youth movement is exactly what we should be doing. We're at the end of the Kobe era and at the beginning of a new era. If you throw in a thirty year old LMA then what? Kobe retires and now you've got a thirty year old plus LMA plus young talent. That has a treadmill team written all over it.   The closest player that would have made ""sense"" for us would have been Cousins, who is only twenty-four. But I was never big on him, he never seemed like a transcendent big man to me. Never has shot over fifty percent and just doesn't seem like he'll take it to the next level."
lakers,3c1411,justsomeguy5,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:35:52 2015 UTC,"This free agency there is nothing to do.  But there are lots of things to improve on so this shit doesn't keep happening.  It's not just the team on the court, but the Lakers are way behind much of the league in facilities, sports science and analytics.  This really matters.  The Lakers used to be innovators and treated players like royalty.  But look at the Gasols.  Pau was mistreated and Marc wanted nothing to do with the team.  Also, I think states like Texas and Florida will, from now on, have natural advantages over the Lakers.  There is no state tax there.  So, guys like DJ who ""take a pay cut"" to play in Texas are actually making more money."
lakers,3c1411,C3PO1Fan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:29:00 2015 UTC,"I think this interest in ""analytics"" is far overblown. No player when it comes down to it is going to be swayed to go any team based on team's reliance on eFG, PER, TS and other just unnecessary advanced stats. We're already building a new practice facility and in regards to sports science, I'd assume that come with new facility.  Marc was never going to leave to Memphis to begin with. While I wasn't happen with Pau's treatment from 2012 onward,  I don't think that's going to be anything that's lingering. If anything, Shaq's trade would have looked worse for the franchise in that regard and no one makes a word of it.  In regards to Texas and Florida will have a natural advantage, eh. While it's true, they do have higher property and sales taxes in general. While that's solely dependent on what you spend as opposed to being taxed on on earnings, your earning potential in Los Angeles is much higher overall. You may get taxed more here, but if you're t with the Lakers that endorsement money will be something serious."
lakers,3c1411,Titanosaurus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:47:03 2015 UTC,"I think this interest in ""analytics"" is far overblown.   It's not about analytics, it's the total of the parts.  No analytics, old facilities, poor sports science.  The Lakers front office is cheap.  Like bottom of the league in a lot of categories.  Sure, they'll spend on players and coaches, but they are miserly when spending on the team infrastructure.   your earning potential in Los Angeles is much higher overall.   Is it though?  I get that this has historically been true, but if you look at the top ten highest paid players (salary + endorsements) it's basically just a list of the ten best players in the league.  If you are a top player, you'll get paid.  Doesn't matter where you are, anymore.  Social media and the internet made LA's advantage a lot smaller.   Marc was never going to leave to Memphis to begin with.   Agreed.  But he went out of the way to say ""I'm not leaving Memphis, but oh... by the way, fuck the Lakers.""  Between Pau and Dwight, there are two talented former Lakers that are clearly bashing the organization when talking to other players.  It seems like the denial is so damn deep.  It's not like the Lakers can never recover; I expect them to be much better in a few years, but the constant rebukes from top tier free agents isn't a fluke.  The team has structural problems that is driving potential players away.  The Lakers are less attractive than Milwaukee."
lakers,3c1411,undercoverbrutha,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:56:06 2015 UTC,"Like I said, we're blowing out on a new practice facility in El Segundo, so in time you'll these things improve. But I don't think that's ever been a detriment for the team, because I've never heard any player, current or former, complain about them.  Location still is a big factor. I can almost guarantee you'll see D'Angelo Russell have more endorsements nationwide (And worldwide considering the Lakers are a global brand) than Karl Anthony-Towns for example.  Dwight is Dwight and I've never heard Pau say anything negative of the organization. In fact I've heard him say the opposite since being gone. In regards to Marc, being his brother, I'd expect that to play a factor for him, considering how close they are. Look how Markieff has reacted to the Suns trading Marcus. I don't think it's anything permanently damning.  I think the reason we're not getting free agents is because we're at a crossroads. The franchise player is thirty-seven this coming August, and our next best players (And future) are twenty-three, twenty and nineteen respectively. The rest of the team is horrible and makes it nowhere near contention. If someone is going to give up max money to stay with their original team and get paid the same amount go elsewhere regardless, they're going to want to win. And a thirty year old LMA isn't going to do that for us. Let's say our three players are stars in four years. Having a thirty-four year old LMA on a max contract does us no favors."
lakers,3c1411,aveydey,5,Sat Jul 4 21:47:19 2015 UTC,"Might be the dumbest post I've seen.  Either you're saying they aren't doing anything at all, which isn't true.  They obviously went after Aldridge.  Or you're unhappy they aint offering a bunch of max contracts to bums.  I'm so happy none of you are actual GMs.  Scratch that, I'd love for you guys to become employed at Boston, San Antonio, Houston, etc..."
lakers,3c1411,Bcanas,0,Fri Jul 3 20:24:58 2015 UTC,"We've unsuccessfully gone after a grand total of three players, Aldridge, Jordan, and Lopez. It would have been nice to simply make an offer to players like DeMarre Carroll and Greg Monroe."
lakers,3c1411,firestulantz,2,Fri Jul 3 20:27:40 2015 UTC,"Lakers offered less than the max to Greg Monroe, and he instead took the max to play in MIL. I have no problem with the lakers refusing to offer the max"
lakers,3c1411,dukefan01496,5,Fri Jul 3 20:47:43 2015 UTC,"Ewww, fuck Greg Monroe.  You don't build a contender with a Greg Monroe, or a Lopez.  Jordan would've been nice, but not for a max.  You don't max a guy you need to take out of the game late in the game unless his name is Shaq."
lakers,3c1411,C3PO1Fan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"With the way the cap is going you are going to be ppaying big bucks for good not great players. We should have tried for Monroe at 15m a season, in 3 years that will be decent starter money. We have to have some sort of base to attract top tier free agents so signing someone like Monroe, Harris, or Carroll who can be a supporting player on a great team is what we need."
lakers,3c1411,magical_poop,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:16:47 2015 UTC,LMAO. Did you see how much money Carroll got? You think he deserves 15 mil per yr?

lakers,3c1411,ceelogreen5,-2,Fri Jul 3 21:42:50 2015 UTC,I think he deserves at least $12m/yr. My point is we should have at least made an attempt to sign players.

Other than the fact that last offseason when we chased Carmelo for damn near forever (even though we all knew he wasn't coming to LA) at least guys like Ed Davis were still available. Now we've put all our eggs into the LMA basket, even when it was pretty obvious he wasn't going to sign with us after meeting 1. I'm glad we did our due diligence in getting a meeting 2 if the first really bombed that bad, but we should have been placing feelers elsewhere like NYK did."

It's always exciting to me to draft players and speculate whether your team just drafted the next big star or not.   Speaking of, really excited to see the Clarkson, Russell, Randle trio next season, assuming they stay healthy."
lakers,3c1411,Kbmakaveli,2,Sat Jul 4 14:52:54 2015 UTC,i'm embarrassed our president had everyone tweet #latola right after bombing the interview
lakers,3c1411,Tb_thrway,5,Sat Jul 4 16:45:21 2015 UTC,"The negativity is there because the Lakers bombed on another summer so spectacularly that no one can really believe it. They've been trying the same approach for 3 summers, and they've failed all 3 of them. They spent all this time creating space and signing everyone else's rejects to maintain it only to pursue 3 people in free agency, go 0/3, and then sit there like a deer in headlights.   There's no defending that nonsense, though some will try."
lakers,3c1411,Kbmakaveli,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:56:52 2015 UTC,"There's plenty of defending it!  There's no need to sign Derrick Williams if you can't sign Aldridge!  You're better off surrounding the young talent with other young talents, and low cost longshot gambles.  And there's no need to rush to sign those guys, there's three months to do that."
lakers,3c1411,mfkswisher,3,Sat Jul 4 07:08:14 2015 UTC,You know what was an Un intended consequence of all that winning? A collective bargaining agreement that is  designed to make us lose.
lakers,3c1411,Doocane,3,Sat Jul 4 00:10:07 2015 UTC,"And even that didn't stop us lol We still managed to trade for two of the top 10 played in the league and save money while doing it. But cuban/gilbert threw tantrums and then ""basketball reasons"" happened.  Now everyone mocks us like our FO sucks which is fucking hilarious considering the commissioner himself had to swoop in and block us. The whole reason kobe got injured and we've been tanking is because of that, nothing we did to ourselves but us in that position"
lakers,3c1411,dalas3322,5,Sat Jul 4 03:26:45 2015 UTC,"Look here's the thing Lakers fans need to understand... we don't need a super star center.  Our starting 4 are looking awesome right now with Russell, Clarkson, Kobe and Randle.  Those guys are all solid and all of them can knock down shots.  All we need at the 5 is a guy who can RELIABLY block shots and get rebounds.  That's all.  He doesn't have to do anything else except catch Kobe's bricks and throw them back outside.  If he can get 0/10/10/10 that would be incredible.    Criteria: Can you run fast? Can you block shots? Can you get rebounds? OK DEAL! Anyone who can fill those criteria will be perfectly fine on this Laker team.  Hell even Tarik Black might end up being our starting center.  He was good last year and the guy is incredibly smart, very creative and musically gifted.  Upshaw might end up being a beast like Dennis Rodman was his rookie year, hopefully the Lakers give him a full on contract after his first summer league game.  All I'm getting at is that we don't need DJ or LMA.  The free agents who would have been serious difference makers on this team were Marc Gasol and Kawhi Leonard.  One was never going to leave Memphis and one was restricted and we could never pry him away from San Antonio anyway.  Remember last offseason everyone was freaking out because we didn't sign Melo? LOL.    I'm sure TWC was hoping we'd get DJ so that we would have to watch 2 hours of commercials every game from all the hacking.  We are going to be OK.  Mitch will scoop someone up who fits that criteria and we will be fine."
lakers,3c1411,howdoesilogin,13,Fri Jul 3 20:24:33 2015 UTC,It's very possible that all 3 of our young guys are busts. Just throwing that out there .
lakers,3c1411,Doocane,8,Fri Jul 3 20:29:23 2015 UTC,Clarkson already passed the 'bust' label.  Your post is nonsense.

Plenty of players have looked really good while young and then hit a wall in their growth and got left out of the NBA because their skills weren't growing anymore."
lakers,3c1411,WOX_69,2,Sat Jul 4 02:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, we can, because he's a second round player.  They don't even usually make the team, let alone end up starting, and definitely not making the NBA Rookie first team.  He can do nothing else and he was a success beyond projection."
lakers,3c1411,DarkKnightCometh,4,Sat Jul 4 06:53:22 2015 UTC,"Clarkson is past the point of a ""bust."" Also, that term isn't meant to be used to players drafted outside the lottery, let alone the second round.

lakers,3c1411,Musingmike,11,Fri Jul 3 23:57:31 2015 UTC,Possible but really unlikely.  Clarkson has already proven to be a solid rotation player at best and role player/6th man at worst.  We'll see about Russell and Randle.
lakers,3c1411,ferociouspandas,3,Fri Jul 3 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"What do you mean unlikely? We are banking on them to become stars. I have no doubt they can become stars, but we havent seen them play. Like ""we'll be contenders if our rookies all become superstars"" is very wishful thinking"
lakers,3c1411,Musingmike,6,Fri Jul 3 20:53:53 2015 UTC,He said unlikely that they all bust. Which is true because Clarkson has pretty much already proven not to be a bust. He was a 2nd round pick man.

lakers,3c1411,Catullan,2,Sat Jul 4 01:48:49 2015 UTC,"Each of the past few years, we've seen relatively obscure players come to the Lakers and significantly outperform expectations. In no particular order: Jodie Meeks, Ed Davis, Wes Johnson, Kendall Marshall, Ramon Sessions, Earl Clark. All of these guys ended up being pleasant surprises, if not exactly star material. Now, it would be nice if we could hang on to those players once in a while, but there's no reason to believe that the Lakers have lost their touch for identifying and developing talent.  The point is, I have faith in the Lakers scouting operation to round out this roster without throwing a bunch of money at star free agents. We're not going to the playoffs, but that doesn't mean this season can't have some more pleasant surprises in store for us."
lakers,3c1411,chequilla,2,Fri Jul 3 21:23:28 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is that fans like you just think with your hearts too much. Everyone here loves Kobe, but he IS holding us back and his ridiculous contract held us back then and still is. He had an incredible career, is my personal GOAT, but once hes gone we can ACTUALLY rebuild. Its not ragging, its just being logical. We are not gonna be good for at least 3 more years, and we wont have people come in until our current young talent has proven to everyone that they are good (which will take a couple of years) and we dont have Kobe's contract eating up money that could be used on someone who can help us. Face it, Kobe isnt what he used to be. I hope he plays incredibly well this season, but season ending injuries on multiple seasons arent good, especially for someone with his miles. I wouldnt be surprised at all if he got injured again this year. the dude has put his body through hell for us. He now needs to know when to walk away. for us and for himself. Fans are allowed to want the best, Kobe himself would disagree with your post. He fights with the FO all the time because he wants moves to be made. so do we."

lakers,3c1411,mylasthope,2,Sat Jul 4 08:06:19 2015 UTC,"thats because the league is shitfed to playing with friends. It doesnt matter what we have if we cant sign a player and a friend. ALso every free agent knows that we STILL wouldnt be contenders if they signed. we are a terrible team atm. and yea i agree, we need to develop our current youngsters. We'll be fine in a couple of years, Lakers fans just panic because we are used to being contenders all the time and because as much as people will hate to admit it, we have both the most dedicated fans AND the most casual fans. its like there is no in between here."

Then the salary cap explodes then we have enough money to throw at least 2 max contracts to max players. We will still have 3 young talented players on our roster.

Kobe isnt on the same track. He wants to win, but he doesnt think he should take cuts for it to happen. Thats just how Kobe is. Hes not wrong, but in this current era its something he is gonna have to adjust to in order to become good again. however i think once the big fundamental wins another this year Kobe will decide he wants to try again. He will want a huge contract, and thats where it will get interesting. He might actually be on another team."

lakers,3c1411,Brucer91,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:44:53 2015 UTC,"The future is potentially bright with some young talent to build around, but fans have every right to be ticked at the FO not signing even some 2nd tier guys for depth at this point. They also still need a starting center. The starting lineup is acceptable with that glaring exception. It is just a shame the Lakers have fallen this far. Past success doesn't matter. This is just about as pathetic as it gets. However, I agree that this is certainly not the end of the world. It's just frustrating that after 2 horrible years, the Lakers will likely miss the playoffs for at least one more year."
lakers,3c1411,realniggacologne,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:29:39 2015 UTC,"Man, the posts on here have been nuts lately. I guess a lot of these fans didn't go through the early 90s with the Lakers. Couldn't agree more with OP. People need to chill and realize we'll get better in time.   Excited for this young core. Develop them. Add to them.  Enjoy the growth process. And maybe we'll get some great prime players later on. But please have patience. Damn oh mighty."
lakers,3c1411,jtingin25,2,Sat Jul 4 03:11:17 2015 UTC,"I can't wait to see a lot of these guys in action!!! The lakers are gonna suck horribly, but it'll be fun watching the young guys develop."

lakers,3c1411,l3all3r900,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:03:28 2015 UTC,The easiest road to failure is lowered expectations. Maybe this is just the new NBA where The Lakers are just one of 30 teams.
lakers,3c1411,GOATLin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:23:12 2015 UTC,"What's so wrong with complaining. Ya I like looking at all the past banners but history is no where near repeating its self. I know Kobe is a huge problem with his payroll, injuries, and lack of wanting to play second fiddle. I know the CP3 veto fucked us real hard. But this organization has lost its touch. In 3 years our best asset we acquired is Swaggy Mother Fuckin P!"
lakers,3c1411,GOATLin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:27:55 2015 UTC,"So far, the only mistake the Lakers have made was offering Kobe a giant contract/extension to show their stars are taken care of. Clearly hasn't resonated with any other potential star FAs."
lakers,3c1411,GOATLin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:45:23 2015 UTC,"Some people have short term memory. However, you do have to agree, this feels so un-Laker like. Cmon, even during the Kwame years, we still managed to make it to the playoffs, and almost beat a Suns team with Prime Nash and Amare Stoudamire. During the Wait before Shaq and Kobe, form 1991-96, we still managed to get 40-45 wins and still make the playoffs and were sorta competative. For the past 3 seasons, it doesn't feel like it. I mean, yeah we're not gonna win big, that was obvious, but worst record in franchise history? 2 straight years no playoffs? Just really hard to swallow.  However, I do still trust our FO. I mean we did get Nash and Howard ( sadly shit happens) We got Chris Paul ( and if shit didn't happen), well we would probably be in NBA Finals contention for the past 3-4 years, hell he woulda made it to the big stage for once in his life. We got Pau Gasol and you see? 3 Straight Finals Appearances and 2 rings.   Change is hard."
lakers,3c1411,GOATLin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:26:24 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah. All those finals appearances and wins in the Kobe era.   Heh, it's kinda like thermodynamics..the LAL built a sound system that handles a bunch of steam and high pressure..but the architect and engineers left the facility to their relatives and new technology and thoughts cam along and... no boom...just a lot of shaky structures and the old tools being used to fix new problems/demands/etc that arise in the system."
lakers,3c1411,razelbagel,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:43:46 2015 UTC,A am also kind of disappointed at how many Laker fans are turning on Kobe.  some really hard core old school fans.  I'm fine with the money we gave him because he earned it and more.  How much better honestly would the Lakers have been without giving him that contract?  I think we would have overspent on some questionable talent.
lakers,3c1411,randy88moss,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:01:10 2015 UTC,"Negativity is actually completely warranted. Prior to Dr. Buss' death we missed the playoffs 5 times. Not only are we on back to back seasons of missing the playoffs but they were the two worst seasons we have had as a franchise. The mix of Buss passing and this makes our entire future questionable, leaving many fans like myself, feel trapped in limbo. Since Jim took over we haven't been able to keep or sign big named free agents. If these don't leave a bad taste in your mouth I question how you are as a fan. We built a culture on winning and being the marquee franchise of the NBA and some of us old school fans might be witnessing this leave us."
lakers,3c1411,crewdoughty,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:15:53 2015 UTC,"I mean, the front office had to know that this year would be a bust for free agency prospects - they kept their picks in Randle and Russell and are hoping that Clarkson lives up to his potential, and that's fine. But it's a gamble - they're unproven, and that (rightfully) frightens free agents. I mean, did anyone expect LMA to be impressed by the Lakers plan? I'm not sure the FO really knows what the plan will be until they see how the new guys work together. If they're as good as we hope they'll be, 2016 will be a much better year for us in terms of free agency. I'm not too hot on Randle, but I think Clarkson and Russell have the tools to become very good guards in this league.   And it's not like signing DMC wouldn't have been a gamble. Well, obviously a proven center is less of a gamble than a couple of rooks, but it would also be questionable whether free agents would want to play on a team with Kobe, DMC, and pretty much nobody else.  So yeah, the front office is gambling on our youngs. If they pan out, we should be in good shape to get back into contention in the West within the next 5 seasons or so. If not, well, rebuilding will take a bit longer than we all hope, but I'm sure it'll get done."

Hopefully this offseason is a wake up call for them that players are choosing organizations these days with current cultures and not the brands that the history of a team like the Lakers brings to the table. Arguing that 'The Lakers aren't bad for long.' doesn't mean anything to a current player that can take the same amount of money in a better situation.  I will say this though: I still think the salary cap should be relative to the State Taxes to where the franchises are located. How this isn't a thing is a joke. Teams with higher state taxes should be able to offer an adjusted salary to players compared to those teams located in states to little to no tax so the take home would be the same for the player."

lakers,3c2b4g,Chilled_Penguin,17,Sat Jul 4 02:39:35 2015 UTC,It would have been stupid to try and sign Tobias Harris an RFA. Orlando would have waited the 3 days before matching. The Laker FO was smart enough not to do a dumb panic signing and tie up their cap space. .
lakers,3c2b4g,likesound,9,Sat Jul 4 02:58:52 2015 UTC,"People are bitching about it but this is so true. Harris MIGHT have been gone had Millsap accepted their max offer (or at least mulled it over for longer), but Millsap declined.   Also, they just signed Harris to a $16M/year deal, which is basically his max. Why do people think we could have stolen him away?"

There would have been a tremendous amount of overlap with our existing talent and we would have had to overpay massively to get him via RFA.

lakers,3c2b4g,chargerland,3,Sat Jul 4 04:57:09 2015 UTC,The lakers need a starting center and backups at all positions. I don't see how this matters. Did people think the lakers would sign him or something?

lakers,3c2b4g,nluna1975,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:55:17 2015 UTC,I disagree. LMA has been very vocal about not wanting to play center. PHX can guarantee he won't play center whereas SA can't make that same promise. With Splitter and Baynes gone when Timmy takes his games off there will only be Diaw and LMA to pick up that center slack. Tim will only play 25 to 30 mins a game and when Diaw comes in LMA will have to put time into the Center position. That's why he's looking at going back to Portland or choosing the Suns cause on both teams he doesn't have to worry about that. If the Spurs make him that promise he signs that day but they won't so his decision has been alot harder.
lakers,3c2b4g,Kbmakaveli,5,Sat Jul 4 05:34:03 2015 UTC,I wonder if we'll get more than 11 players

lakers,3c2b4g,lebbe,10,Sat Jul 4 02:53:08 2015 UTC,There was never any 2016 FA hope to begin with. You think KD would choose us over OKC or Wizards just because we have Tobias?  Time to face reality. This team is a bottom dweller and will remain so for years to come. No big name FAs will choose to come here. Our only hope is to get picks and build through the draft.

lakers,3c3qsg,DUBBZZ,2,Sat Jul 4 14:22:11 2015 UTC,That's what's kinda frustrating because if that's truly our plan then we haven't leaned any lessons from this summer or last. Superstars don't want to give up even one year to rebuild if they can get the same money from a promising team.
lakers,3c3qsg,jerkidiot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"We're doing a true rebuild here.  Which means Russell, Randle, Clarkson and everyone else are going to have to show it on the court.  Sit back, relax and enjoy the rookie tank next season."

lakers,3c3qsg,dalas3322,2,Sat Jul 4 15:00:55 2015 UTC,conley is staying with the grizzlies. great situation for him and after all the pushing he has done for gasol to resign it would look hyporcrtical for him to leave.  biggest names lakers could get are derozan and jennings two one dimensional chuckers. kupchak will get played by durant next year like he has been by melo and lma and all the other quality free agents will sign elsewhere.

Obviously at this point we don't know what DAR is going to be like. He could be amazing or a total bust, or he could get hurt, who knows. I'm not making any projections, I'm just saying hopefully he'll be good enough that the Lakers won't be looking to fill a hole at the 1 in two years. That's all, nothing more."

That's on top of another #1 pick Irving.  You want to copy Cavs? Maximize your chance to get #1 pick. Which means tanking.

lakers,3c11ji,PopeyeMcThugg,17,Fri Jul 3 20:18:08 2015 UTC,"I don't like it he Clippers at all, but what the fuck is that guy thinking? He just left two top 10 players to go play with a 50 year old Dirk, Wes Matthews recovering from an achilles tear, and his boyfriend...."
lakers,3c11ji,BeefCat10,28,Fri Jul 3 20:15:18 2015 UTC,He's thinking max contract; with no state tax; In a city that's a 30min flight from where his home is. DJ hasn't seen endorsement money in LA. He needs all the on court $$ he can get. As this will more than likely be his only max contract of his career.
lakers,3c11ji,mes8007,6,Fri Jul 3 20:17:49 2015 UTC,Makes more sense when you put it that way
lakers,3c11ji,tree_D,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:18:38 2015 UTC,"Yea but Texas is state tax free. For a guy who doesn't have major endorsements, this is a big factor. Cali state tax I believe is the highest in the nation. It's over 11% that on top of federal taxes. And he's in the highest tax bracket.. That  means in Cali he's seeing aprox 22- 25% of his check gone. In Texas its significantly lower. We are talking millions in savings."
lakers,3c11ji,mes8007,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:32:28 2015 UTC,"Good points, weren't the clippers allowed to offer more money? But the state tax comes out to the same then as the deal in Dallas?"
lakers,3c11ji,tvfilm,2,Mon Jul 6 02:23:43 2015 UTC,True but u have to work a extra yr. In Dallas he's getting the same amount with the tax adjustments in only 4 yrs as he would make in 5 in LA.
lakers,3c11ji,mes8007,5,Sat Jul 4 19:34:37 2015 UTC,Deandre Jordan's main goal is not to win a championship. He said he wants a bigger role and cash...Mavs gave that to him.
lakers,3c11ji,ss3happy1,3,Mon Jul 6 02:20:44 2015 UTC,"Money, I think. No taxes and cheap as fuck to live in Dallas compared to LA"
lakers,3c11ji,ashishvp,2,Fri Jul 3 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that DJ knows that the Clippers have hit their ceiling and have no flexibility(unless they break up the team) so having a core of DJ, Parsons,  Matthews, Cuban, cap space and no state taxes will be enough to pull in another free agent next year."
lakers,3c11ji,LowkeyAnushole,3,Fri Jul 3 21:42:51 2015 UTC,Who is the FA that pushes that team over the top? Durant is not going there.....that team goes no where in the West without a superstar.
lakers,3c11ji,BeefCat10,0,Fri Jul 3 22:15:01 2015 UTC,But u know strangely enough.. If he wanted more money. Why not go Lakers.. Young roster and a huge international endorsement slot looking to be filled. With the Mavs he's basically be traded in 2yrs for draft picks as the Mavs will suck.
lakers,3c11ji,mes8007,2,Fri Jul 3 22:17:00 2015 UTC,"Or take a 2 year deal at the max with a player option and get a new contract when the cap goes up. They guy has played 322 games in a row, pretty safe bet. Especially considering players like Wesley Matthews gets $13 a year at his age and coming off the worst injury possible."
lakers,3c11ji,BeefCat10,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:27:39 2015 UTC,"But of a risk. 2 yr with clips made sense becuz u know he could more than likely redo what's he's done in that system. But to risk money on a 2 yr deal else where when u dont really have a skillset outside of rebs. Very risky. Safe bet was taking long term deal if moving to a new system. I think he'll be productive in Dallas. But no where near as productive as what he was for Clips. Perhaps more efficient defensive wise though, Rick Carlisle is more of an efficient coach than doc."
lakers,3c11ji,mes8007,2,Fri Jul 3 20:30:12 2015 UTC,"That's what I meant, a 2 year with the Clippers. Especially if he's truly worried about Blake leaving. The Clippers give him the best chance to showcase his strengths and hide his flaws."
lakers,3c11ji,BeefCat10,14,Fri Jul 3 20:37:29 2015 UTC,Tis will be fun to watch the Clippers team struggle for a fifth seed.
lakers,3c11ji,Shambaree,-18,Fri Jul 3 20:39:16 2015 UTC,You're giving them too much credit! They have no center and can only sign a mediocre one if they're lucky. This is a potential lottery team.
lakers,3c11ji,schnide1,20,Fri Jul 3 20:12:13 2015 UTC,"What? Did CP3 and Griffin die? They'll be in the playoffs, but nowhere near as good as last year."
lakers,3c11ji,zzyyxxqq,3,Fri Jul 3 20:22:00 2015 UTC,They dropped the ball with not foreseeing this and having RoLo or even Chandler as a backup plan.
lakers,3c11ji,Bromine21,2,Fri Jul 3 20:33:32 2015 UTC,In the east they'd still be top 4. West is different. I see them on that 8-9 border.
lakers,3c11ji,schnide1,3,Fri Jul 3 20:40:51 2015 UTC,"Wait wait wait...last I checked CP3 is still the best PG in the league  and Blake ain't no scrub either.   and they got Lance and Paul Pierce which should help their bench.  Come to think of it, why the fuck did DJ leave?"
lakers,3c11ji,ashishvp,-2,Fri Jul 3 20:52:00 2015 UTC,Those are two of the best players in the league and it STILL might not be enough to make it in. Think about the competition for those 8 spots...
lakers,3c11ji,schnide1,2,Fri Jul 3 21:41:21 2015 UTC,Okay...tell me 8 teams that are better than the Clippers as of right now
lakers,3c11ji,ashishvp,0,Fri Jul 3 21:46:27 2015 UTC,They're gonna be top 4 easy.
lakers,3c11ji,bio-logist,-1,Fri Jul 3 21:50:53 2015 UTC,"Once again, never said they were going to be bottom of the west. Lottery is by definition just missing the playoffs. I wasn't saying it was a guarantee either, but it is a very real possibility. Here are 6 teams definitely better than LAC: GSW, HOU, MEM, SAS, DAL, OKC. Here are 3 teams MAYBE better: NOP, PDX, PHX. That puts them at anywhere from 7-10. 8 seed probably most realistic. Which is nowhere near top 4. Even this year, they were only in the 2-5 range (all separated by a game). A drop-off from there should be expected."
lakers,3c11ji,schnide1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:57:41 2015 UTC,Dallas isn't gonna be better even with DJ. MAYBE Phoenix and NOP. Definitely not Portland.   I project 6th seed for the clips this year. Probably not much worse.

lakers,3c11ji,Cienes,14,Fri Jul 3 19:59:27 2015 UTC,"Doesn't mean there's a rivalry. It's more Laker fans not used to seeing Clippers doing well, and people hopping on their bandwagon. They've never met in the playoffs, and there's no real on-court animosity (Clips/Warriors is one to look out for tho).  Kobe said he'd want one last shot at Tim Duncan in the playoffs, if it puts it in perspective."

lakers,3c11ji,mes8007,2,Fri Jul 3 20:19:10 2015 UTC,"Yea I thought Mavs would end up as a lottery team but this certifies them as a playoff team although not sure what slot though. I guess it depends on Nugs, Kings but we probably are the worst team int eh West."
lakers,3c11ji,TheDenverBroncos,3,Fri Jul 3 20:16:58 2015 UTC,"Crazy, just like that clippers look to be headed the wrong direction with a aging pg and sg. Plus unreliable players like Jamal and Lance etc. Sucks they just officially missed their championship window. Blake cp3 and Paul pierce won't be enough. Not in the west. They'll be competitive and make it as a 6-8th seed for next 2 yrs. But that's their ceiling now and after that. All downhill."

lakers,3c11ji,DUBBZZ,2,Fri Jul 3 20:15:16 2015 UTC,He's from Texas and this is probably going to be the only max contract he's ever going to get so he took it. I do wonder who is going to throw him lobs now. It's going to be interesting to see how he does w/o CP3.

lakers,3c1j4i,jphenom5,18,Fri Jul 3 22:19:08 2015 UTC,"We don't have the cap space to do both, we only have about $24 million.  David Lee is earning $15mill and Nene is earning $13.  Unless the Wizards want to sign and trade for Hill and take Swaggy we can only take 1 deal.  One of the problems is that the Warriors can't trade any draft picks until 2019 and don't own any other teams picks, the only thing they can give us is Looney who cuts into our cap space even more.    The other problem I have with it is we need to start signing some players for more than just 1 year.  We can't develop chemistry when we have a revolving door 5 of new players logging 20+mpg a night.  Both Lee & Nene are 32 and don't really fit into our long term plans unless they re-sign at a market rate next year.  I'd like to get one of them and either Looney or a Washington 1st round pick next year and use our remaining cap space to go after a young guy or two on a multi-year deal, unfortunately KJ McDaniels and Kofus are about all that's left, but we could probably sign the two of them and absorb Nene's deal.    It's also not the worst thing if we pick up one of Lee or Nene and have space under the cap to start the year, we could use that space to facilitate trades for other teams and pick up assets."
lakers,3c1j4i,_im_on_acid_,3,Fri Jul 3 22:46:08 2015 UTC,"Can we send Young + smaller trade exception to the Wizards in exchange for Nene? That'd mean we take back $8 mil in salary, enough for Lee's contract. not that this happens on the Lakers' (or the Wiz's) end, just getting the logistics down"
lakers,3c1j4i,justgivingsomeadvice,3,Fri Jul 3 23:44:05 2015 UTC,"Probably?  I don't see why not, but I'm not as well versed in the cap as some other folks here.    You'rre right that the Wizz would never do that, they've had their fair share of Swaggy P and don't want any seconds."
lakers,3c1j4i,_im_on_acid_,3,Fri Jul 3 23:52:15 2015 UTC,Trade exceptions can only be used on a player that makes less than the exception is for. You can't bundle players and exceptions into one big package.

lakers,3c1j4i,teo1315,6,Sat Jul 4 09:53:48 2015 UTC,"I'm very pro-this. Was actually just telling a friend we should do it. We need to acquire picks for the future.

lakers,3c1j4i,ceelogreen5,0,Fri Jul 3 22:41:16 2015 UTC,For teams to do this they'd have to want some other player to sign. Almost all good free agents are gone. There is zero incentive for these teams to trade with the lakers and give out picks.
lakers,3c1j4i,spanskolajno,5,Fri Jul 3 22:37:25 2015 UTC,The Wizards are rumored to want to sign David West (he's still available) because Wall wants a stretch four. West has a better mid range than Nene.  The Warriors want to avoid the salary tax and want to get rid of David Lee in a salary dump.
lakers,3c1j4i,devotedhero,2,Fri Jul 3 22:41:59 2015 UTC,We don't need you to take Nene for david west though. That's the thing. This is kind of dumb for us (Wizards fans).

Given Upshaw's issues, I know I'm being optimistic, but please go back and watch Deandre's early years and college and compare that to Upshaw. Upshaw has serious issues, but if he gets focused, he can be as good if not better than Deandre. 4 blocks a game is no fluke. He has the measurements and he's talented. Have faith bro"
lakers,3c0d1q,Memoney,-1,Fri Jul 3 18:20:24 2015 UTC,Dude the chances of 1 player developing to his fullest are slim now you're saying 4 of ours players are guaranteed to hit their ceiling and then some is craaaaaazy. Cmon you even said Aldridge is on the wrong side of the 30 yet he's 29 at the moment!! I'd love for this too happen but let's be real the chances of this happenin are the same chances that we'll know for sure how the universe came to be just no... No

My team is the Blazers and I fucking hate you guys but I'll give respect where it's due and I agree that Clarkson looked pretty good against us.  Good luck y'all."
lakers,3c0d1q,AyeKale,3,Sat Jul 4 05:59:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, the future is bright, but like 3 or more years from now. After the past couple years, you really think there is much to enjoy the next season? It's gonna be brutal. If they reach 30 wins, it would be a successful year. I'm just sick of watching them be viewed as a joke. That is the issue for me. I don't mind the Lakers not getting Aldridge or most of these other guys. However, I want them to get SOMEBODY because Center is still an issue right now as well as depth."
lakers,3c0d1q,abbaby85,9,Fri Jul 3 19:06:34 2015 UTC,"Just remember that all the b.s. you hear from the other fan bases comes from years and years of defeat at the hands of the Lakers. It's pathetic to see, and no other team in the NBA is getting the treatment quite as harsh as we are but that's only because of how many enemies we've made through out the decades. I take it with a grain of salt and a little smirk. They hate us cause they aint us!"
lakers,3c0d1q,high5ghost,3,Fri Jul 3 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly. The hate we're getting is so bizarre until I realize the damage we did to their teams. Whether I'm listening to podcast, reading blogs, or on twitter, it's been nothing but negative things. The hate that Kobe got from Henry Abbott others has been absurd. I just try to brush it off. We've witnessed greatness for so long. Let them have their fun for this brief period of time. We'll be back"

lakers,3c0d1q,OnlyinVegas,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks for saying what we all feel. I've been a Lakers fan since the Eddie Jones, Nick Van Exel, Elden Campbell days. They were not the best team at all, but they had heart.    I've seen the dark days and the glory days. The Lakers franchise has it's ups and downs, but would you rather see a Lakers team win rings by buying players or through great coaching and player development? I always loose respect for teams who try to buy rings.   Remember all of those disasters the Lakers have made to try to buy a championship? Remember the Karl Malone year and how much tension there was on the team? Or remember the Dwight Howard fiasco? Let's rebuild and do it like Golden State.    I'm excited for the 2015-2016 NBA season. I'm ready to see what Clarkson, Randall, and Russell can do. I'm also excited to see what Byron has in store for his young team. Remember, dynasties take time."
lakers,3c0d1q,goat_justinanderson,0,Sat Jul 4 21:56:00 2015 UTC,"Ummm... You just compared a 22 year old rookie that was picked in the 2nd round to Tobias Harris, a player who was picked 19th in 2011 and averaged 17 pts 6 rebounds last season. Kinda crazy if you ask me..."
lakers,3c0d1q,wh11,5,Fri Jul 3 17:13:31 2015 UTC,"Very true, but he got those stats playing power forward, going against slower guys and we want him to play the 3 and guard the opp's best players. That's kind of crazy if you ask me. He's a decent 3 point shooter and his defense isn't good. Brown is not as good as him, of course. But if he can become a good 3 and D player, why pay Harris the max? And if not Brown, then we need to find someone who can guard the other teams best player. It won't be russell, and clarkson will guard the best perimeter player. That leaves Harris as our go to stopper for the next 4-5 years. We'd be doomed. I'd rather roll the dice on what we have, while maintaining flexibility. Lets not be rash because we're striking out. Let's focus on developing the promising players we have.  Edit: What if I compared a 22 year old rookie named Draymond Green that was picked in the 2nd round to David Lee, a player who was picked in the second round and averaged 18 and 9 the season before? We don't know what the future holds, but it's bright and we drafted capable players. Be patient."

Kobe retiring may not be enough. Jim Buss may still be there.   Look at Boston. They have a draft pick cornucopia and can't build a winner and no one wants to sign there.  And before you think it can't happen here...it happened to Boston.  Boston.

lakers,3c44xl,DaRealDucane,-1,Sat Jul 4 19:12:50 2015 UTC,"Shut up, dude. Young players' development tends to be stunted when their team is historically bad, and it helps them to have veterans to learn from/follow. Kobe isn't good with rookies. It's not about ""big moves,"" it's about moves, period. Or should we roll out a four rookie lineup? Do you really think that's good for them in the long run? Do you think it was good for them not to sign Ed Davis on a super reasonable contract?  We need to sign players. We need to fill out our roster. The Lakers FO fucked up by waiting on pipe dreams, and they're fucking up by not pivoting.   This comment explains it perfectly."

lakers,3c2fnp,lars5,2,Sat Jul 4 03:45:22 2015 UTC,28 points total and he broke down that trap with ease. There's a post on SBnation about it too
lakers,3c2fnp,thevisitor,2,Sat Jul 4 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"yeah they tried to get the ball out of his hands, so he went into catch and shoot mode in a bunch of plays.   The pg on Ohio State has a similar game to Clarkson, which makes me really excited to see Russell and Clarkson playing off each other in the same way."
lakers,3c2fnp,lars5,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:22:41 2015 UTC,He played both 2 and 1 I believe at the OSU
lakers,3c2fnp,dissphemism,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:05:07 2015 UTC,"if you watch the games, he starts at SG and plays off ball a lot. The PG's role on that team is to basically bring the ball up to half court and pass it to Russell. Most plays start with a floppy where russell cuts baseline getting the screen as he comes across, which allows him to receive the pass from the PG in the spot where he shoots the highest percentage from 3. From there he basically runs the offense. I assume this is to preserve his energy so he can play most of the game and not be harassed up and down the floor."

lakers,3c14dl,TuneHD,0,Fri Jul 3 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"I would love to get Harris and I'm not saying we shouldn't offer him the max. We probably would if he showed interest. But we aren't getting him, we probably aren't getting anyone good this off-season."
lakers,3c14dl,mes8007,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:14:38 2015 UTC,I'd rather wait for the right guy. Who's coming to LA for Tobias Harris?
lakers,3c14dl,NattyDread10K,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:14:03 2015 UTC,The right guy needs to be interested in the first place. Having Tobias at the 3 is a lot more appealing then what we have now
lakers,3c14dl,KookLife,0,Fri Jul 3 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"We don't know what we have right now so that's not true. We don't know how Clarkson, D'angelo, and Randle will pan out."
lakers,3c14dl,borisr55,10,Fri Jul 3 21:25:44 2015 UTC,On paper at the moment it looks horrible. But what if D'angelo comes out like lillard rookie yr.  Randle comes out beasting to. And Clarkson shows to be efficient again. Plus perhaps upshaw looks to be 2015' Whiteside. This is a likely scenario too.. Or they could all just bust lol... But being a fan is about believing in our young guys.
lakers,3c14dl,KookLife,4,Fri Jul 3 20:25:25 2015 UTC,"Thats very optimistic, but I dont think Upshaw will average 10 rebounds a game in his rookie year, and even if all of our rookies are good by rookie standards, we will still be awful. I believe in the talent, but im curious as to if we are trying to tank again this year"

lakers,3c14dl,mrbenoit,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:28:18 2015 UTC,"A top 3 pick. There is talent in every draft, just need to evaluate it correctly. Simmons, Skal, Bender, Ingram would be a solid pickup, especially simmons or ingram"
lakers,3c14dl,Tbuckelew,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:12:31 2015 UTC,Our pick is only top 3 protected. That means if we fall out of the top three we lose our pick. If we are gonna tank we have to tank hard and be luck to not screw up in the lottery.
lakers,3c14dl,ArrowBat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:24:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah we are definitely in a tough situation. I was just trying to say that we don't need to tank for someone specifically, and there is talent in every draft, especially in the top 3 positions if we are lucky enough to keep our pick.   Now that everyone is off the board, I am strangely okay with just rolling with all rookies and seeing what happens. If we somehow managed to lock in that top 3 pick we would be rolling out a pretty interesting lineup that could really grow together."
lakers,3c14dl,high5ghost,4,Sat Jul 4 17:30:53 2015 UTC,"We'll run a   Russell/Clarkson/Kobe/Randle/Black starting 5, which isn't necessarily that bad for us. We may not win a lot but that will give our guys a lot of opportunity to really learn each other.  As of right now our bench line-up would be something like  Jabari Brown(?)/Swaggy/Anthony Brown/Nance or Kelly/Upshaw or maybe Jordan Hill if we re-sign him.   We really need to snag another cheap ball handler (can be a D-League dude for all I care) to fill out our rotation. We also should sign 2 more bigs imo."
lakers,3c14dl,ArrowBat,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:28:34 2015 UTC,"There's 48 minutes at point, right? Just have Clarkson/ Russell always run point.   backcourt: 16 min Russell/ Clarkson, 16 min Russell/ Kobe,  16 min Clarkson/ Brown (Mizzou chemistry)  would be fine?"
lakers,3c14dl,Neilmev,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:08:15 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of always having either Clarkson and Russell run point, even if they start together. So if Russell subs out, Clarkson can continue running the point, with young, kobe, brown, and possibly randle rotating at the SG and SF"
lakers,3c14dl,savonjeesus,4,Sat Jul 4 00:44:37 2015 UTC,People are thinking it's foolish to tank. Guess what? It doesn't matter. We're going to end up with the worst record in the league anyways!
lakers,3c14dl,zomgmatt,2,Sat Jul 4 03:32:26 2015 UTC,Lakers win 27 games. (UNLESS THEY LAND A BIG FREE AGENT) If they do any worse I will eat my shoe
lakers,3c14dl,Musingmike,0,Fri Jul 3 20:41:56 2015 UTC,Get ready to eat it then. We only won 21 games last year and the roster as currently constructed is significantly worse...
lakers,3c14dl,lolxddavid,5,Fri Jul 3 20:57:14 2015 UTC,How much worse is it though? We only lost Ed Davis so far... and with Russell on board I'm sure he'd be better than Ronnie Price...

What was the plan a week ago?  2016.  You want dude to just toss away the plan cause he didn't get Aldridge?  Next year we have more developed talent and an assload of cash.  That's always been the plan.  Sorry he didn't offer Monroe a max deal to appease some whiny ass kids on the internet.
lakers,3c14dl,LeeHarvey_Teabag,4,Fri Jul 3 20:54:32 2015 UTC,The plan was free agency 2016? Nobody wants to come here. Why would they? We have 0 proven core

lakers,3c1aes,PaperDesk,6,Sat Jul 4 05:48:19 2015 UTC,Be calm and be careful what you wish for. You don't want to sign some guy then regret it.
lakers,3c1aes,denimourson,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:11:48 2015 UTC,"Considering our cap situation, can we actually sign anyone expensive enough to merit regretting? I mean the Mav's signed a guy with a torn achilles for 15 mil per season and when he busts they probably still won't give a shit because of the cap hike next season."
lakers,3c1aes,Notalent13,0,Sat Jul 4 05:57:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, we need to be patient."
lakers,3c1aes,nbaballer8227,15,Sat Jul 4 03:33:53 2015 UTC,I agree. The time to wait and see is long past. The problem with hanging on to a big cap is that we will be in the exact same situation next year and be rejected left and right AGAIN. EVERYONE is going to have lots of cap room next year and the year after. We need to get some pieces and fast.
lakers,3c1aes,poops__everywhere,0,Fri Jul 3 21:10:58 2015 UTC,"Except not. If the rooks and sophomores develop, - and they probably will because of heighten playing time - then they'll be more attractive. You're looking at this as if we have a lot of money this year but honestly Kobe has a huge % (about 37%; and Young's terrible contract) of the cap, and a coach like Byron doesn't really blast to players as attractive. He burns his players as if this is old school ball, and it's not.   You understand that after Kobe is off the books, there's enough money for at most 2.5 max players. Assuming cap rises next year (and it will), they'll have nick young, whoever is signed this year (hopefully for cheap) and the rookies...  Stop complaining about not winning. It's a new era and this fan base needs to adapt to that as much as anyone."
lakers,3c1aes,Tb_thrway,13,Fri Jul 3 21:30:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not complaining about not winning. All I'm saying is we need to add value, which we haven't done. The FO plan seems to be= swing big on an all star FA, and if that doesn't work just sign a bunch of mercenary 1-years, and rinse and repeat. Right now our team is Kobe + little kids. That's it. There's no guarantee ANY of these young guys will develop, and even if they do develop, why would any of them want to stay here when their contracts are up?   As a Laker fan since the early 80's there has always been a strong sense of family in the organization-even through the cedric ceballos and van exel years. I just feel that maybe we've lost a bit of that closeness and camaraderie along with the winning culture that the franchise worked so hard to develop.   TLDR; we need to add value pieces before we can get bigger pieces"
lakers,3c1aes,poops__everywhere,3,Fri Jul 3 21:37:52 2015 UTC,No big name free agent is gonna come solely because of a bunch of rookies playing better than expected. They wanna win now. Best shot we have is to keep our space develop these young guys. Hope we get a top 3 pick and pray to the basketball gods that two big name free agents wanna come here together. Cuz that's the only way we're enticing big name free agents to come from a basketball standpoint
lakers,3c1aes,BerriesNCreme,2,Fri Jul 3 23:06:49 2015 UTC,"If we have room for 2.5 max contracts then 2 free agents can talk amongst themselves and decide to come here as a package knowing them along with the rookies (assuming they show the promise this season) then knowing they could also add a nice role player with the rest of the money is enticing. This is similar to what Miami did with Bosh and Lebron. Not saying it will happen or even be as good of a team as that, but it's a decent scenario, especially with LA being a destination."
lakers,3c1aes,Phatferd,2,Sat Jul 4 00:52:05 2015 UTC,Really hope we don't give Tobias the max. He isn't worth it.
lakers,3c1aes,bio-logist,6,Fri Jul 3 22:00:52 2015 UTC,"His max is $15 million, which when the cap goes up is equivalent to 16% of the cap or the same as 11 million is now. He is definitely worth 11 million under the current cap, he will be worth 15 under the new cap."
lakers,3c1aes,Conflict_NZ,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:04:13 2015 UTC,Wow. Didn't know he averaged 17 a game. Fair to give him that.
lakers,3c1aes,bio-logist,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:11:07 2015 UTC,This. Couldn't agree more. 22 at that price is worth it.
lakers,3c1aes,polvitos,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:25:51 2015 UTC,"He's 22, averaged 17ppg and can't sign for more than 4 years.  As /u/Conflict_NZ said he'll only be 15% of the cap next year when we can offer up 2 max deals, and in year 3 of the deal when the cap jumps to $108 mil in 2017 his $15 mill will be even less."
lakers,3c1aes,squirrely_control,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:50:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. Didn't know he averaged 17 a game last year.
lakers,3c1aes,bio-logist,2,Sat Jul 4 17:11:24 2015 UTC,"I say we just forget LMA and offer Bismack Biyombo a reasonable deal and give Tobias Harris max. And also see if we get Boozer and Stoudemire for cheap. yes, Boozer. Also give KJ McDaniels and Kevin Seraphin and shot."
lakers,3c1aes,likesound,2,Sat Jul 4 01:04:16 2015 UTC,"Aside from missing out on Ed Davis, the Lakers are doing the right thing. Don't overpay for role players that would cripple your flexibility down the line."

lakers,3c1aes,GeorgeLovesBOSCO,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:19:46 2015 UTC,"It's pointless to sign Harris, because he can't sign an offer sheet until 7/9, so it's better to wait until then. And they shouldn't waste cap space in case LMA decides to sign with us. I'd rather wait and see, no need to make a desperation signing right now."
lakers,3c1aes,squirrely_control,3,Fri Jul 3 21:59:28 2015 UTC,"If LMA signs elsewhere we need to sign Harris to a max on 7/9 and hope Orlando doesn't match.  The Lakers are a laughingstock right now, we can't pitch people properly and Monroe turned down a max from us to play in Milwaukee.  If we sign Harris and get him thats great, we add a 22 year old that scored 17ppg last year.  If we don't get him we can still add David Lee.  Regardless it will be nice to just sign him to an offer sheet so everyone saying ""no one wants to play for the Lakers"" shuts up."
lakers,3c1aes,polvitos,2,Sat Jul 4 00:46:53 2015 UTC,Most players couldn't sign right away either but made binding commitments prior to signing. The same could be done with Harris.
lakers,3c1aes,GeorgeLovesBOSCO,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:25:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe, he was still going over offers since he's restricted. I really wish we can get him though if the LMA thing doesn't work"

lakers,3c1aes,polvitos,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:24:18 2015 UTC,I'm right there with you. We can sign someone that can have an impact and be cost effective - K.J. McDaniels anyone?   We need to fill out a roster of talent if we want to attract players next offseason. Clearly a dead roster doesn't appeal to anyone this offseason!
lakers,3c1aes,_Wi11,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:31:49 2015 UTC,"Even if we didn't sign anyone big, I'd rather retain our good players like Ed Davis. These big name FAs have been screwing us because we always put all of our eggs in one basket. Why not build first then attract a big name later?"

lakers,3c5dto,cabrerabear,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:12:30 2015 UTC,"Same here. I'd rather see the Lakers compete and if we miss the playoffs it's as #9-12 hopefully. Sure we're in the lottery but if we miss and give up the tenth pick in an apparently weak draft class then I don't feel bad. If we get lucky and hop into the top 3 we're lucky, but if we tank and fall out of the top 3 I'd be livid (as would the rest of us).  We're a young squad with two All Star vets most likely past their peak (Hibbert isn't officially past his prime but he's been written off). I'm excited to see the youngsters grow. Rebuilds aren't fast, you can't get big FA talent without pieces to build around them. This year we have pretty much all unproven commodities, if we're competitive and win 30-40 games this season then 2016 will be much better come the summer."
lakers,3c5dto,StealthRUs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:44:45 2015 UTC,65% chance means way more likely than not to keep the top 3 pick

To add, free agents probably would not be convinced that the Lakers are gonna be competitive."
lakers,3c5dto,StealthRUs,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:22:33 2015 UTC,"About the same as what would come out of winning 28 games, except at least we tried to keep the pick.    No free agent is going to be convinced the Lakers can be competitive after a 28 win season, either."
lakers,3c5dto,TempMedicine,8,Sun Jul 5 13:13:07 2015 UTC,"Tanking for what? The Lakers would have to bottom out to keep the pick. And then what? Another young asset that free agents won't want to play with? Two losing seasons is enough. I don't care if they don't make the playoffs or get an awful seed, I'm just tired of watching bad basketball."
lakers,3c5dto,Bromine21,3,Sat Jul 4 23:34:11 2015 UTC,"As well purposely tanking is bad for development, we have a solid young core. Let them be hungry and aggressive, at the very least make it an exciting 25 wins."
lakers,3c5dto,SlightlyRyan,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:40:53 2015 UTC,"I don't want to tank this year, but I think the tank last year was good for Clarkson's development. He would've never got that many minutes on a good team as a rookie."

This is a shit plan, but the FO put themselves in a position were they couldn't tank by trading away all picks and the CBA is not at all favorable to these Lakers in the summer were small markets always get advantages. We'll see if more cap space makes a diff next year but I doubt it..."
lakers,3c5dto,joeinthebox,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:13:33 2015 UTC,"Yah, I think we're done with tanking. I think we roll with the young, promising players we have and hope they develop swiftly because then we will be able to attract some marquee free agents and look towards the playoffs and beyond."

lakers,3c0geo,RickSmith123,29,Fri Jul 3 17:17:58 2015 UTC,Could he be? Yes.  Should we bank on him being? No.  It's a best case scenario. Luckily he comes with little to no risk.
lakers,3c0geo,camlawson24,2,Fri Jul 3 17:57:01 2015 UTC,"Could he be? Yes. Should we bank on him being? No.     I agree. But adding to that and being optimistic here; if he can stay clean, growing with our young core would be a great opportunity/scenario for him and the Lakers. As some have said on this sub, he seems like the ideal front court mate for Randle. He's 7'0, has a 7'5 wingspan, has a decent jumper and lead the NCAA in blocks at one point. He also seems to finish well around the rim.    It's a perfect pairing if you ask me. But the ideal thing to do, if I were the Lakers, would be to bring him along slowly and pay close attention to him. Constant drug tests and check-ins by Mitch should be required during his first couple of years with the Lakers. They should also give him an ultimatum: stay clean or hit the road. If they do sign him after summer league (which they should, after striking out in FA this year), they should structure his contract with the possibility of him slipping up in mind. That way, waving him wouldn't damage financial flexibility."

lakers,3c0geo,aveydey,15,Fri Jul 3 18:28:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Upshaw will become that guy, but I can tell you as a Husky fan, this guy is really, really fucking good. He is just extremely raw, and has obvious off the court issues and character flaws.   But if he works hard and stays clean, granted a huge if, he can be perfect for the Lakers. The dude is long, mobile, and has a nose for blocking shots. Watching the huskies this season I don't think I've ever seen a player have such a huge impact. Opponent post fg% went up almost 20% after Upshaw was dismissed. He is insane.   I obviously carry some bias but I'm really excited to see if the Lakers can whip him into shape both physically and mentally. If he plays out the whole season at UW, he's a top 20 pick, and we just got him for peanuts."
lakers,3c0geo,razelbagel,6,Fri Jul 3 17:42:51 2015 UTC,LA is probably the worst place for a guy with drug/party issues unfortunately
lakers,3c0geo,WLVTrojanMan,11,Fri Jul 3 19:20:14 2015 UTC,"Meh, you can find drugs in any city of you want it. Ya there are more places to go out here than some other cities but if he's not going to work on himself and stay straight then he isn't taking this seriously and isn't going to work out anyway.  Only way he works is if he commits, regardless of city."
lakers,3c0geo,razelbagel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:38:34 2015 UTC,"And there's the seperate argument that in other, smaller cities, there's nothing to do so people just turn to drugs for entertainment."
lakers,3c0geo,rjvir,2,Sat Jul 4 00:18:26 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately true.  When you're young it's easy to say no to some dude offering you a rail, but when it's some pretty gal asking you to take a hit it can be a different story, especially if you already have issues."
lakers,3c0geo,ginbooth,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:41:17 2015 UTC,"Have you read the expose on Javaris Crittenton? Him going to LA totally got him involved with the wrong people, but him getting traded is what led to his serious spiraling out of control. Same thing happened with Lamar, actually.  You're right LA has everything to make him fuck up, but if he has the proper support, he can overcome all of that. Whether he will or not... well that's another issue completely."
lakers,3c0geo,justgivingsomeadvice,14,Fri Jul 3 23:59:16 2015 UTC,"My friend was on the Huskies, and he said Robert's problems were extremely overhyped"
lakers,3c0geo,Kbmakaveli,14,Fri Jul 3 18:17:59 2015 UTC,"""I don't wanna hurt nobody just wanna party"" - Robert Upshaw"
lakers,3c0geo,SPMrFantastic,7,Fri Jul 3 19:09:12 2015 UTC,We need to sign him now to a contract before other teams snatch him from us. D:
lakers,3c0geo,clippjoint,3,Fri Jul 3 20:29:24 2015 UTC,This is not even a joke. It techincally could happen.
lakers,3c0geo,ethanol_clearburn,8,Sat Jul 4 01:04:38 2015 UTC,It'd be pretty brutal if Upshaw chooses to sign with a different team. At this point it wouldn't surprise me sadly. Lakers better lock him up while his value is as low as possible.
lakers,3c0geo,shootmans,7,Fri Jul 3 20:33:05 2015 UTC,"He may not end up being our savior at center, but I'm very excited to see him in summer league. His interviews leading up to the draft made it sound like he was really getting his shit together. He's from Fresno, so I think being close to his family might help."
lakers,3c0geo,Buckelroo,5,Fri Jul 3 18:07:12 2015 UTC,Hopefully he can move his family away from Fresno.
lakers,3c0geo,dendenmoooshi,5,Fri Jul 3 18:44:31 2015 UTC,That explains why he's ghetto lol
lakers,3c0geo,duragjones,11,Fri Jul 3 18:18:54 2015 UTC,Would rather have Upshaw on the cheap + preserving cap space for 2016 then overpaying for garbage like Robin Lopez.  Flexibility is the key along with not panicking.
lakers,3c0geo,p0se1d0n,6,Fri Jul 3 18:13:25 2015 UTC,Garbage? Lol someone is a little salty
lakers,3c0geo,duragjones,16,Fri Jul 3 18:19:11 2015 UTC,"Lopez averaged 9.5 PPG and 6.6 RPG and is a soft defender.   You want to pay him $12-13 mil per year for those stats.   Jimmy,  is that you? Lol"
lakers,3c0geo,p0se1d0n,4,Fri Jul 3 18:23:30 2015 UTC,That's a little overpay but we have to do that to get some solid pieces before we even think about superstars signing here. And those are stats look at where he places in defensive categories he would've been great for us as a rim protector and decent shot blocker
lakers,3c0geo,duragjones,6,Fri Jul 3 18:26:24 2015 UTC,Nobody is coming to LA for an opportunity to play with Robert Lopez lol.
lakers,3c0geo,NowhereManTAP,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:28:40 2015 UTC,"Or Kobe, apparently..."
lakers,3c0geo,sneakAstroke,2,Fri Jul 3 22:10:45 2015 UTC,"As happy as I am to let him play this last season with that contract, I don't blame them.  If he can't stay on the court, he's not bringing them closer to a title."
lakers,3c0geo,virji24,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:31:06 2015 UTC,"""Robert"" 😂😂😂"
lakers,3c0geo,aveydey,2,Fri Jul 3 23:31:48 2015 UTC,Autocorrect but what I put seems more fitting lol
lakers,3c0geo,JeremyDolphin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:47:06 2015 UTC,I wanted Lopez until I saw that contract he got. Just awful. Dodged a bullet there
lakers,3c0geo,SPMrFantastic,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:15:19 2015 UTC,Nah it's Vivek.
lakers,3c0geo,TheRealMindGamez,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:29:21 2015 UTC,Totally agree. We need to hit homeruns not panic and bunt out singles.
lakers,3c0geo,FuriousFlex,-1,Fri Jul 3 18:32:19 2015 UTC,Would you like some tequila with your salt?
lakers,3c0geo,aveydey,5,Fri Jul 3 19:10:12 2015 UTC,"He spoke with Bill Walton and has undergone therapy sessions to fix his off the court issues. Sounds like he's been working hard to redeem himself.  If he keeps himself on the up and up, works hard with the coaching staff to prevent any future missteps, I really don't see why he can't become a shot blocking defensive machine."
lakers,3c0geo,JustaGangsta,3,Fri Jul 3 18:26:48 2015 UTC,He needs to clean up his act... no more dugs and all this other crazy stuff. It's up to him. He can be our long time Center we all need. He can grow with this young core.
lakers,3c0geo,FuriousFlex,3,Fri Jul 3 19:30:41 2015 UTC,"He reminds me of young Rodman when he entered the league... troubled but just seriously great at basketball.  The guy was a janitor before he went to the NBA.  Chuck Daly became a mentor and father figure to him and he became one of the best PFs to ever play the game.  Now I'm not saying Upshaw is a total headcase like Rodman or that he's going to turn out to be a superstar like The Worm, but the dude was the #1 shot blocker in the NCAA and only played in 19 games.  His troubles are way overblown and this dude could end up being awesome for us, especially if we strike out with FA centers."
lakers,3c0geo,Toomuchgamin,3,Fri Jul 3 20:30:14 2015 UTC,"If you take away the off the court stuff and just leave Upshaw the basketball player, where does he get drafted? Top 10? Mid first?  Obviously those issues are there, but this is an insane opportunity, the sort of prospect who could negate likely giving up a first next year."
lakers,3c0geo,ss3happy1,3,Fri Jul 3 20:41:49 2015 UTC,"I agree, maybe hopefully he can become part of our future."
lakers,3c0geo,shootmans,2,Fri Jul 3 21:40:11 2015 UTC,Time for another Bynum.
lakers,3c0geo,jtromo,5,Fri Jul 3 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"Or we can sign the old Bynum  Lol just kidding, we had our run with him."
lakers,3c0geo,Musingmike,0,Fri Jul 3 20:32:17 2015 UTC,I'd still take him over Sacre.
lakers,3c0geo,The_Real_William,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:44:25 2015 UTC,At least sacre will be in the game. 76ers ended up with a guy to warm the bench
lakers,3c1k77,fakeshits,6,Fri Jul 3 22:27:47 2015 UTC,The Knicks have made two decent signings.  The Lakers have done nothing.  Can't compare right now.
lakers,3c1k77,JustAGuy993,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:36:18 2015 UTC,We're fucking up big time.
lakers,3c1hvy,Conflict_NZ,3,Fri Jul 3 22:08:57 2015 UTC,"We might just keep our draft pick this year... I hope these guys are all amazing out the gate, but we are really young at this point with old man Kobe. Let's hope for greatness, but plan for the worst."
lakers,3c1hvy,SSD65,4,Fri Jul 3 22:10:19 2015 UTC,"While I agree the pick is top 3 protected, even if we finished as the worst team there is still a 35% chance we lose it. Tanking shouldn't be the main priority, I would love to get the 9th or 10th seed just so Philly doesn't get a good pick out of us."
lakers,3c1hvy,aeisenst,2,Fri Jul 3 22:12:14 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure we don't need to tank to keep that pick. This is a really, really bad team. Lots of potential, but next year we are going to stink."
lakers,3c1hvy,ceelogreen5,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:26:46 2015 UTC,Yep. The tanking has pretty much already happened by not getting Aldridge. Nobody that we sign at this point is going to make us good enough to compete for an 8-seed in this conference.
lakers,3c1hvy,rejectx,6,Fri Jul 3 22:52:58 2015 UTC,"let's just sign McDaniels, Koufos and take a salary dump + assets I would still be pretty happy with this."
lakers,3c1hvy,Laker_Junkie,2,Fri Jul 3 22:10:21 2015 UTC,"For sure, I hope we can get Lee or Hibbert, just some kind of frontcourt rotation."
lakers,3c1hvy,poops__everywhere,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:12:52 2015 UTC,I've been completely on board with this in the last 48 hours. We have to salvage the free agency period and add a couple contributors
lakers,3c1hvy,aeisenst,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:54:23 2015 UTC,"Kobe, Clarkson, D'Doeee, Sacre, and Randle starting lineup here we come!!!"
lakers,3c1hvy,TimeisIllmatic95,3,Fri Jul 3 22:12:35 2015 UTC,Probably start Black instead of Sacre.
lakers,3c1hvy,jonnysh,2,Fri Jul 3 22:27:38 2015 UTC,When you put it like that I give it til maybe december until kobe murders the team.
lakers,3c2upg,TakeMe4GrantedBB,14,Sat Jul 4 06:11:07 2015 UTC,"I'm more upset about people posting the same type of diary entries about how they feel over and over again, especially when the content is usually irrational or just straight up wrong. Things suck right now, it's just reality."
lakers,3c2upg,BeefCat10,5,Sat Jul 4 06:16:46 2015 UTC,I don't think people understand how overrated this summer's FA is. Mediocre players getting paid big money. Same with last year.
lakers,3c2upg,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Sat Jul 4 06:38:43 2015 UTC,Agreed. This is a very weak free agent group.
lakers,3c2upg,sayheykid24,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:23:19 2015 UTC,"Sadly, it's gonna be the same ordeal next summer outside of KD, Conley, and Horford."
lakers,3c2upg,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:03:16 2015 UTC,Yeah people on this sub just freaking out because fans of inferior teams are celebrating and talking shit to us because their teams signed guys like Robin Lopez and Tobias Harris.
lakers,3c2upg,aveydey,3,Sat Jul 4 14:04:41 2015 UTC,I'm upset that we let Ed walk. Did FO even give him a call?
lakers,3c2upg,Havok-Devastator,3,Sat Jul 4 06:37:24 2015 UTC,They called him after their meetings with LA and DJ
lakers,3c2upg,dc041894,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:05:01 2015 UTC,I think Ed was a good player but there are many professional basketball players that can give you the same production at a cheaper price. I don't understand why the idea of being in a rebuilding process is so negative on this sub. Many people on here feel that player development is very different from signing middle of the road players when it simply is not the case. We are in fantastic salary cap health and there's no need to jeopardize that.
lakers,3c2upg,jgaskins34,2,Sat Jul 4 07:03:24 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why the idea of being in a rebuilding process is so negative on this sub.   It's because we're fans of the Lakers. We've been spoiled over the years and now we're having to deal with what other teams have to go through so often. We've made it to nearly half the NBA Finals, we're used to having marquee players on our team, and a few years of mediocrity is making our fans crazy."
lakers,3c2upg,Havok-Devastator,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:21:38 2015 UTC,"Not downing the rebuilding process, just saying I wish we could've brought him back. He wasn't asking much, I mean they're paying swaggy like 5 mil(?) for doing what?"
lakers,3c2upg,sgad88,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:16:23 2015 UTC,"I think people are upset because Ed Davis is getting something like 7 million a year with Portland. We could have easily given him a similar contract, and the dude is worth every penny."
lakers,3c2upg,NicDwolfwood,2,Sat Jul 4 07:22:19 2015 UTC,"because signing free agents is important whether for immmediate impact or to look good to potential free agents in the future  With the Lakers not doing shit in free agency not only does it hurt them short term, but also long term. It hard to sell Superstar free agents to come to a team who's been a lottery team 2 seasons in a row and are headed for a 3rd. Developing young talent is good, but you also need good role players to field a solid team, with enough depth. not having both not only weakens your team, but also raises the chance of injury if you have to play your good players alot of minutes because there is no depth"
lakers,3c2upg,Notalent13,2,Sat Jul 4 06:21:05 2015 UTC,"Don't forget we also have no first rounder this year unless we manage to hyper tank our way into a top 3 pick again.  I'd be ok with tanking if we for sure had our first rounder...but we don't, in fact even if we tank hard its unlikely we keep it."
lakers,3c2upg,LauranceFuller,-2,Sat Jul 4 08:21:10 2015 UTC,"not signing free agents to irrational long term contracts   we haven't signed anyone to any contracts   Why do so many users see signing free agents as a solid move compared to developing what we have?   we barely have a team, we literally need to sign players and it would be nice if they didn't suck"
lakers,3c1dmk,fakeshits,2,Fri Jul 3 21:34:32 2015 UTC,I think he will definitely struggle more offensively because no more CP3 to lob him easy dunks!
lakers,3c1dmk,sneakAstroke,2,Fri Jul 3 23:02:43 2015 UTC,Na mavs have that covered if they get lin. Jj and harris are gold aswell. Mavs and clips were the only 2 teams last year that had over 100 Alley oops. And we had an aging chandler too
lakers,3c1vf0,rjvir,3,Sat Jul 4 00:06:34 2015 UTC,Time to trade Swaggy
lakers,3c1vf0,GreatAmerican1776,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:06:45 2015 UTC,"This is why we shouldn't be panicking. Everyone will have cap space, but we could easily add two max players next offseason. I'd imagine if we had the space to add both LMA and DAJ this weekend year, things would be pretty different right now."
lakers,3c1vf0,Donkeykongalan,-3,Sat Jul 4 03:44:06 2015 UTC,Means we can sign role players to max contracts but won't even do that. We'll swing for the fences and miss every time. Oh but we will do the Swaggy P thing for some reason. We'll get the league's superstar retard somehow again.
lakers,3c1vf0,BeefCat10,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"In all honesty who did you want the Lakers to sign? Outside of Ed Davis, I don't really see massive mistakes. Also please don't say Tobias Harris because the Magic apparently will match whatever is offered."
lakers,3c1vf0,rejectx,2,Sat Jul 4 00:25:48 2015 UTC,"I wanted us to pursue Tyson Chandler and DeMarre Caroll. They would fit perfectly and help our rookies develop, obviously not for the money they got."
lakers,3c1vf0,BeefCat10,2,Sat Jul 4 00:33:20 2015 UTC,"That last line basically sums it up. Our core is made up of 20 year olds, while Chandler is 33 and Caroll is 30 and both just got long deals where they are honestly probably both overpaid."
lakers,3c14b4,molson24,5,Fri Jul 3 20:20:50 2015 UTC,I say we take a shot on Javale McGee.
lakers,3c14b4,poops__everywhere,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:41:32 2015 UTC,"he's the same type of player as Upshaw, long arms rim protector, catch some lobs. adding hill would provide some more versatility"
lakers,3c14b4,poops__everywhere,4,Fri Jul 3 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"Jordan Hill really did not show me much versatility all of last year. I'd rather have a guy with freakish athletic ability who scores at 60%+ in the paint, boneheaded issues and all."
lakers,3c14b4,krillinit,2,Fri Jul 3 21:14:33 2015 UTC,"Upshaw might not be here since he's not on a contract. He makes a good fit on this team, though."
lakers,3c14b4,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:11:31 2015 UTC,No thanks.
lakers,3c14b4,nigg_a,2,Fri Jul 3 21:42:00 2015 UTC,We should sign Tobias for max then sign some other vets to 1 or 2 year to fill up our cap then resign jordan hill with bird rights and trade him for hibbert and a first round or second round pick. Thats my ideal situation
lakers,3c14b4,badguymatt,2,Fri Jul 3 20:59:05 2015 UTC,"I'm all for it. I don't understand why we STILL haven't offered the max to Tobias. That is, unless we're the unknown team but that was probably fucking Guangdong for all I know."
lakers,3c14b4,Kbmakaveli,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:30:16 2015 UTC,"If we offer a deal to RFA, it means our money is locked up for 3 days while Orlando decides whether to match. In the meantime all the free agents could be gone"
lakers,3c14b4,badguymatt,2,Fri Jul 3 20:33:28 2015 UTC,"All of our money would be gone, so we couldnt sign free agents, so basically what we're doing now"
lakers,3c14b4,cowboy925,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:51:11 2015 UTC,"I understand that, yeah. But what I mean is since we've literally done nothing but chase the top guy (again) and have struck out on everybody, there's no reason not to freeze our money for a few days. We could still sign Jordan Hill. As far as I know, we're the only team that's even contacted him this offseason."
lakers,3c14b4,ashishvp,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:35:08 2015 UTC,"Tobias Harris is the top guy left, lol"
lakers,3c14b4,AboveBall,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:37:18 2015 UTC,"And if we don't, some other team will take him. 28 other fucking teams can offer him a max."
lakers,3c14b4,RolloJTomasi,2,Fri Jul 3 21:48:56 2015 UTC,"no they can't, most teams don't have cap room to offer a 15mn deal. there's maybe 5 or 6 last I checked"
lakers,3c1j5p,mister_greyMATTER,15,Fri Jul 3 22:19:23 2015 UTC,he seems to think so
lakers,3c1j5p,lars5,5,Fri Jul 3 22:44:43 2015 UTC,"HA! Didn't know this existed, that's awesome. Thanks for sharing!"
lakers,3c1j5p,sneakAstroke,3,Fri Jul 3 23:08:21 2015 UTC,Favorite team: Spurs 👎
lakers,3c1j5p,lars5,6,Fri Jul 3 23:34:33 2015 UTC,"could be worse, he could have been a celtics fan."
lakers,3c1j5p,rl3191,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:59:37 2015 UTC,He drew a pretty good logo
lakers,3c1j5p,TimeisIllmatic95,3,Sat Jul 4 00:02:02 2015 UTC,That could be why the Lakers: a) Haven't signed any wings in the offseason b) Drafted him in the 1st round when he was projected to go in the 2nd round.
lakers,3c1j5p,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Fri Jul 3 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"Good point. Maybe they saw something in him that others didn't? I mean, our FO did draft Clarkson. He seems like he could be a great role playing guy.    EDIT: Not signing a wing would also keep our flexibility, I guess."
lakers,3c1j5p,Gardeon,3,Sat Jul 4 01:51:29 2015 UTC,"IDK much about the guy like the rest of us, but I recently watched the DraftExpress video of him and he looked like he has a lot of potential especially on the defensive end and has leadership qualities too."
lakers,3c1j5p,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Sat Jul 4 06:13:56 2015 UTC,The leadership is what stood out to me as well. Dude's got the composure of Derek Fisher.
lakers,3c1j5p,rejectx,2,Sat Jul 4 13:54:09 2015 UTC,That's a nice comparison.
lakers,3c1j5p,KillaKamNewtun,3,Sat Jul 4 21:02:48 2015 UTC,"I would say yes, he is really athletic (IDK if he can run, not just jump) and he is probably best defender on our team now."
lakers,3c1j5p,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Fri Jul 3 22:24:02 2015 UTC,"(IDK if he can run, not just jump)     I found myself questioning that as well. If he can sprint those lanes, I'd say he'd be great at SF."
lakers,3c1j5p,redundantPOINT,2,Fri Jul 3 23:11:52 2015 UTC,"not that he plays like him, ive never actually seen Nance play, but everytime I seem him, he reminds me of Matt Barnes. so hes got that going for him. lol"
lakers,3c1j5p,sillyspaghetti27,2,Fri Jul 3 22:30:18 2015 UTC,Barnes is a good one and I've even seen someone say McRoberts on here which isn't bad either.
lakers,3c1j5p,redundantPOINT,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:51:29 2015 UTC,"Lol that's a pretty good comparison. He reminds of Luke Walton whenever I look at him. His game kinda resembles Luke's as well, except he's way more athletic."
lakers,3c2krh,ricecuker,6,Sat Jul 4 04:16:28 2015 UTC,"It's not Mitch fault, it's Jim Buss and Jeanie who put the ""win within 3 years"" window, Mitch has no choice other than to go after big names because of that. Mitch is the one who has to fix their mistakes"
lakers,3c2krh,Tweefin123,2,Sat Jul 4 04:19:55 2015 UTC,Also harden and Russ are not free agents next year
lakers,3c2krh,FreshDiamond,0,Sat Jul 4 06:07:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, they completed wasted their time chasing big name free agents that never had any intention of actually signing with us. Yes, our roster would look a lot different if they had more realistic expectation going into this off-season. Will this off-season be the wake up call our FO desperately needed? I fucking hope so. Let's hope that is enough for now."
lakers,3c2krh,Tbuckelew,3,Sat Jul 4 04:28:39 2015 UTC,"Meh things are better than they look.  If the rooks can stay healthy and develop,  and some of the Laker greats can mentor Upshaw,  this could be a young formidable squad in a few years."
lakers,3c2krh,Kukantiz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:56:29 2015 UTC,By missing out on the big names not going after anyone isn't really a bad thing. We will have the ability to sign 3 max free agents next year. Not saying that is the route they will take it or that it will work but I think it is more appealing to tell two or 3 guys. We have a solid young core and cap room for you guys to play together than it is to say hey come play with essentially two rookies and a Second year pg.
lakers,3c2krh,FreshDiamond,2,Sat Jul 4 06:06:16 2015 UTC,"My problem is NOT signing big name free agents! The problem is that we cant get ANYONE to sign. We need to fill out the roster with SOME names. We cant just let the young horses run free. Yes, I am excited about our young talent, but who's there to teach them? We have no vets! Kobe? He doesnt give 2 shits about anyone on the team. What makes you think that Jim and Mitch can work the FA market next year if no one wants to take our money this year! We have approx 25M to spend and what did we get in return...."
lakers,3c2krh,FreshDiamond,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:14:44 2015 UTC,Because we will be able to give two or three of them he opportunity to play together and D Lo and randle will have a year under their belts. If they show they can play at a high level we may become very appealing next offseason.

It'd take injuries to our entire roster that would force us to sign every member of the D-fenders for us to have a good shot at it. Gonna be really difficult to keep that pick, but at the same time, we're going to have one of the worst records in the league too.   Tanking isn't an option IMO unless we have one of the worst records in the league towards the end of the season. Just win every game possible."
lakers,3c2z6v,Remote95,3,Sat Jul 4 07:18:05 2015 UTC,"At the end of the season, regardless of where we sit we'll be watching the lottery praying that percentage comes off.  I don't see the point in winning 7 more games to have a 15% chance over 56%.  It will be us and the 76ers at the bottom with the Nuggets potentially making moves to sneak in. If we can get bottom 2, chances are we keep it. I say we just develop our talent, increase our odds and hope this comes off. Every contender had a bit of luck somewhere along the road."

He's a reliable 3-point shooter with some defensive chops, though he's somewhat injury prone. Plus, he's from LA and, according to Jabari Young of Comcast SportsNet NW, wouldn't mind a homecoming to the Lakers. I can definitely see him fitting in well with our core guys and would be happy to see him sign a contract in the neighborhood of 3 years/$13 million."

lakers,3c1gfz,TimeisIllmatic95,3,Sat Jul 4 07:03:56 2015 UTC,"Brewer signed with the Rockets.     Koufos makes too much sense. If the FO fails to sign him, I'll start losing trust in them relatively quickly. It's already a damn shame they didn't recruit Robin Lopez well enough and that they let Ed Davis walk while waiting on players who likely weren't coming to the Lakers.    Mitch is really good at the things he can control (draft, trades), but it seems like the FO has problems convincing players to buy into their plan. The last four or five free agency periods have been really bad for the Lakers (ever since we signed MWP, basically), and I'm concerned that they're not learning from their mistakes. So just sign Koufos and a relatively affordable wing (not Tobias Harris) who can guard Lebron/KD/etc and let's start building a semi-respectable team that will have assets that we can trade in the future, if need be. Because whiffing on every single valuable player in FA and punting the ball 'til next year will probably only lead to the same results.    And our situation isn't made much better by the fact that the only ""tradable"" assets we have right now are cap space and young players who we should keep around and develop."

lakers,3c2t91,Notalent13,0,Sat Jul 4 05:59:48 2015 UTC,that's why we're signing no players and didn't resign Ed Davis. Sacre starting at center will make it pretty hard to win any games.
lakers,3c2t91,JustAGuy993,6,Sat Jul 4 06:00:32 2015 UTC,if the lakers go 0-82 there's still only a 64% chance they keep the pick.  That's fucking horrible.  If they tank this coming year for Philly they will have even more egg on their face than they do now.  It would be a colossal embarrassment and they can't afford to have that happen.  Better to try and win some games to re-establish a winning culture.  No FA other than scrubs wants to join a dumpster fire.
lakers,3c2t91,Anwar_is_on_par,3,Sat Jul 4 06:09:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Unless we trade for another pick or we get our pick back, tanking would be a disastrous move.  We just need to build what we have, our future is out in the open right now, it's dependent on D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, and Jordan Clarkson. We can't develop those guys by intentionally losing for a pick that will end up in Philly's hands anyway."

lakers,3c2t91,Buckelroo,3,Sat Jul 4 16:40:15 2015 UTC,I hope we absorb some contracts and get some picks out of it. David Lee could come with a first round pick and maybe Kevon Looney. The Knicks are going to be looking to pedal Jose Calderon away and we could get another pick from that.
lakers,3c2t91,FreshDiamond,2,Sat Jul 4 05:56:20 2015 UTC,There is no benefit in tanking. We may not win very much but Byron is not going to be coaching to lose
lakers,3c2t91,FreshDiamond,-2,Sat Jul 4 05:57:29 2015 UTC,There is no benefit in tanking? What about losing more games in order to get a better draft pick in order to actually get a draft pick? It's gonna be a 'stealth tank' but only to the average fan.
lakers,3c2t91,RyanLaFalce,6,Sat Jul 4 05:58:55 2015 UTC,"Ummm because our pick is top 3 protected. We have more talent on the team than we have in the last 2 years. Which netted us the number 7 and number 2 picks. We lucked into the number two pick and were worried about not even having one. The New York Knicks were the worst team all season then won a couple games at the end to fall to the second worst team. They fell out of the top 3. If Kobe Bryant can stay healthy we will win some games that we could lose. Because well good luck telling Kobe to sit down. We are not going to be bad enough to get a top 3 pick without a massive stroke of luck. Not worth it all. All tanking accomplishes is making the lakers look bad, which makes it that more difficult to bring in free agents. Next year we may have room for 3 max players. We haven't had the opportunity to sell a fa on playing with another star free agent. We will next year. Why try to lose"
lakers,3c2t91,lakers__sad_summer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:20:49 2015 UTC,Who are the top prospects for next year's draft?
lakers,3c2t91,BeefCat10,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:51:39 2015 UTC,"I already had faith in Jordan Clarkson as being part of the back court going forward, he just needs to sign that extension next year.  Than, Julius Randle. I see a lot of game in him and when paired with JC, that's synergy.   I'm not high on D'angelo Russell like others, mainly bc his shot doesn't look crispy and he looks like a pusharound; thankfully he is smart and crafty on passing, so that should make up if he isn't shooting 3's or blowing past defenders like crazy.  To me, that's the future already and no need to go begging in the lotto for another top 5 pick bc LAL kinda were lucky to land that pool of top 5-10 draft talent.   Not to mention Tarik Black, he might project well bc he earned some playing time last season over vets like JHill, Ed, and Booz."
lakers,3c2t91,lakers__sad_summer,2,Sat Jul 4 06:03:07 2015 UTC,There is a grant land shot chart that showed he shot 47% from 3 on the right side. His shot is pretty nice and should only get better.

lakers,3c2t91,pistolpete4407,-1,Sat Jul 4 06:07:50 2015 UTC,"Basically. His game has a lot of cross over too, and that will no doubt be taken as 'showy' by vets he takes on. Like, Steph Curry and them can do that to those other teams old farts, but if a kid tries doing that and he wears a Lakers jersey...idk, man...those vet guards in the league will be butthurt as well as jelly. Probably take it all out on him.  But over all I'm just thinking about he doesn't look as strong as a guy like Emanual Mudiay whose a worse player but still looks to have more muscle mass hypertrophy. Like I said, Russ will use his brain but if he had that type of regiment Mudiay had he'd at least beast over the bullies and totally demoralize them."
lakers,3c2t91,Donkeykongalan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:16:22 2015 UTC,"I think Mudiay is abnormally large for a guard. After seeing more of Russell, his physique is actually more than what I expected and he's so long for a guard."

If you can attach a narrative to even the smallest story it has a better chance of catching on and all of a sudden, you're ""the guy"" that broke that part of the story, whether it's true, partially true, or completely false. My example would be when we deleted the LA to LA tweets there were media members suggesting we did it out of saltiness when in fact it was by NBA request.

And to top it off, Laker bloggers are out there with their ""sky is falling"" mentality, not helping and generally discussing rumors like they're fact.  (Their recent anti-Jeannie claims are based on NOTHING they know first hand; they just want to pretend like they're knowledgeable.)    Laker community is pretty insufferable rightnow.  Also to continue the rant, I do not get how these leaks about ""so-and-so is leaning to this team"" get out.  Unless it comes directly from the player's mouth, it's a totally unknowable and unmeasurable opinion, and I don't listen or trust any source/info claiming anything like that.  I really don't think Deandre, say, is telling someone ""I'm 70-30 going to Dallas"".  These numbers are meaningless and a waste."

lakers,3c2e1y,Prince_Aladeen,12,Sat Jul 4 03:08:13 2015 UTC,"You're wondering why the Lakers couldn't sign anyone in free agency? I'd love to tell you. We failed to sign free agents because they (the free agents) have NO IDEA who they would be playing with. Nobody, even us, knows the types of players Clarkson/D'angelo/Randle are going to be. Or if Kobe, even at under 30 minutes a game, can stay healthy for an entire season. We can hope for the best, but a free agent isn't going to walk into a situation blindly. Why? Because that's bad business!   We are not going to be able to attract free agents until we have something to offer. Look at the Knicks as an example. Even though they lose more games than us last season, they were still able to sign players this off-season. That's because free agents know what Carmelo can do. We have nothing to offer free agents except wishful thinking. LA will become an alluring destination for free agents when our rookies make a name for themselves in the league. Which will not happen in just one season. Until then, kiss free agency good bye. You think KD is coming in 2016? Haha, come on. He's not coming. We have nothing to offer him. Everyone is going to have money in 2016, and our money isn't special anymore. The sooner people realize that our franchise isn't going to be rescued by a superstar free agent signing, the better. Let the rookies plays! And boys, get ready for several more bad seasons."

lakers,3c1po5,diondrems,3,Sat Jul 4 05:33:06 2015 UTC,Looks like the Magic intend on matching any (Laker) offer offered to Harris.

lakers,3by3xu,WhiteHorseTito,22,Fri Jul 3 02:54:42 2015 UTC,I believe this was announced last year or the year before. It was Jim Buss' idea and not Jeanie's iirc
lakers,3by3xu,_Wi11,6,Fri Jul 3 03:11:11 2015 UTC,It was his idea but it doesnt need to be brought up. Its just unnecessary negativity.
lakers,3by3xu,streetsweepskeet,2,Fri Jul 3 04:21:12 2015 UTC,"Interesting rumor floating around: Jim was the one that leaked that negative stuff about the meeting with LMA, which makes sense because it came from a writer with Laker sources and LMA wouldn't leak that. Then Jeanie goes onto the radio and brings this shit back up for no reason. I really hope they aren't starting a sibling rivalry in the middle of fucking free agency."

lakers,3by3xu,cellcell,5,Fri Jul 3 05:49:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah I never understood the hate, We all know Jim isn't his father but hes not a moron like everyone in the media attempts to make him out to be. Lets be honest the lakers are still the major target for troll radio hosts and clickbait articles and because of that his ""public"" image has suffered."
lakers,3by3xu,psychotichorse,2,Fri Jul 3 16:22:40 2015 UTC,"Jim got CP3, Dwight and Nash. All of those were good basketball decisions, even Nash at the time. Jeannie gave Kobe a 2 year $50M deal. I think it's clear who the bad one is."
lakers,3by3xu,misterrunon,2,Sat Jul 4 01:55:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah.. I never hated him that much, but I don't think I even hate him at all now. I don't think our problems are necessarily because of him. He might suck at what he does, or he might not.. but it's not all on him, like fans tend to believe."
lakers,3by3xu,itsyourdestini,3,Fri Jul 3 11:04:02 2015 UTC,I think some are starting to shift the blame towards Jeanie.
lakers,3by3xu,PatronSaintOfUpdog,13,Fri Jul 3 19:10:54 2015 UTC,"And who would replace him? I'm fine with Jim doing what he does, it's not his fault Cp3 got nixed. We got Dwight for Bynum, and he's had way less of a chance to build this franchise than obviously less competent owners like Dolan, Sterling, Jordan, etc have had.  I'm ALL for a change in management, and while I'm sure Jim isn't the only problem, we better have a real replacement lined up if need be."
lakers,3by3xu,lars5,3,Fri Jul 3 03:02:46 2015 UTC,Mitch and Ryan probably get promotions.

Looks like no one is signing because they haven't proven they can put a team together that will win, and the current strat cant do that."
lakers,3by3xu,Tweefin123,35,Fri Jul 3 05:50:27 2015 UTC,"Him resigning doesn't mean they will sell the team, most likely her taking over. She just needs to shutup and stop throwing him under the bus publicly."
lakers,3by3xu,ChapulinDescalzonado,34,Fri Jul 3 02:56:25 2015 UTC,It's Jim Buss who made the statement and made it public. She  frequently gets asked about the statement; is she supposed to deny it? Of course not. This is public. The media is trying to get a reaction out of Jeanie.
lakers,3by3xu,GreatAmerican1776,12,Fri Jul 3 02:59:47 2015 UTC,"While that's true, why are we so sure Jeanie isn't part of the problem? I mean what has she ever done to deserve always getting the benefit of the doubt."

Of course the media is trying to get a reaction, that is why you don't speak to them and keep in private. Jeanie and Jim hate each other and are ruining the team because of their beef."
lakers,3by3xu,electro_report,7,Fri Jul 3 06:53:49 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call a 5 billion dollar tv deal a bad aspect of business operations...
lakers,3by3xu,Tweefin123,5,Fri Jul 3 14:32:10 2015 UTC,"It's the Lakers, I could have made the same deal."
lakers,3by3xu,chargerland,0,Fri Jul 3 21:57:47 2015 UTC,It's pretty clear that she was the main force behind the Kobe contract.
lakers,3by3xu,Titanosaurus,7,Fri Jul 3 07:28:53 2015 UTC,"She is the main reason behind the Kobe contract. And honestly, I respect that decision."
lakers,3by3xu,psychotichorse,0,Fri Jul 3 13:57:15 2015 UTC,How can you? I love Kobe but she gave him a Max deal when he hadn't come back from surgery yet. Kobe should have been talked into a Duncan contract.
lakers,3by3xu,Titanosaurus,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:53:32 2015 UTC,"Dr Buss's biggest regret was not properly saying goodbye to Magic. And he always reminded his children about that. Jimmy and Jeanie be damned if they let that happen with kobe. Could they have given him a smaller contract and still say goodbye? Maybe most likely.   Kobe deserves it. You might disagree, I get that."
lakers,3by3xu,psychotichorse,0,Sat Jul 4 02:31:11 2015 UTC,"Kobe deserves great treatment and the fans respect, he was a beast and the ultimate winner. However, no one coming off of a Achilles injury at 36 should be given $25M per year. I defended the contract originally, I love Kobe, but he's an albatross to the team at this point. It's two summers in a row he's been a major contributing factor to other stars not wanting to come to Los Angeles.  Edit: also Dr. Buss was a saint with Magic. I don't know where you get that. Magic retired because of his HIV and Buss gave him $4M just because he loved him and paid him the rest of his contract and gave him ownership. What else could he have done?"
lakers,3by3xu,GreatAmerican1776,0,Sat Jul 4 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"No, she's not, but she keeps involving herself by saying dumb things in the media."
lakers,3by3xu,LetsGetADrink,7,Fri Jul 3 03:51:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think what she said here is dumb.. I mean I don't really know the context of why she said this, but it isn't anything that Jim Buss hasn't already said."

The Lakers aren't even gonna go to the playoffs next season and the following season isn't even guaranteed. However, I could see the lakers getting a lower tier playoff seed in a couple years and maybe sneaking a playoff series win. They won't reach the NBA or even conference finals though for at least 3 years from now."

lakers,3by3xu,aveydey,2,Fri Jul 3 17:33:59 2015 UTC,It was Phil or West and the Lakers chose Phil.
lakers,3by3xu,Wateriswet1212,2,Fri Jul 3 18:01:58 2015 UTC,I don't get this. He got a lot of backlash back in 2012-2013 but I think the general fan base is behind him again.

lakers,3by3xu,itsyourdestini,2,Fri Jul 3 17:04:26 2015 UTC,When people say bring Magic as owner he means him and his billionaire homies. They want him to be the face   They hired people who are smarter than them to run the Dodgers .
lakers,3by3xu,FuriousFlex,2,Fri Jul 3 17:16:42 2015 UTC,Our solution is bringing back Magic... and the Logo
lakers,3by3xu,kerby720,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:45:37 2015 UTC,"Jeanie Buss has done nothing for the Lakers for me to have confidence in her taking over moving forward.    She's the one that overrode Jim's decision to wait and see before offering Kobe a bloated contract. She ended up being the one to offer Kobe the 2 year $48.5 million contract before he was even back from his ACL injury. With her being responsible for the business side of things, she decides it's a good idea to present all the outside activities that would be available to LMA if he signs with the Lakers. Aldridge who has never seemed to be one that craved the spotlight. He just seems like an unassuming guy that's willing to do what he has to on the court, but not looking for endorsements necessarily. Not to mention being heavy on the Hollywood with her #LAtoLA. She's the one that has made no secret of posing nude in Playboy and even has a semi-nude picture of her as her twitter handle. That is not the image you want of someone running a team/company/etc. Jeanie is also responsible for the Lakers marketing department, so it's safe to say that she was probably responsible for the #stayd12 banners that were hung to try and convince Howard to stay. Lastly, she seems to have it out for Jim from the very beginning. Take the decision to hire D'Antoni for example. It was made by Dr. Buss, cause he wanted to recreate the Showtime era. However, Jeanie kept laying the blame on Jim and Mitch. All around the same time, Phil was throwing his support behind the team. Coincidence?   I have one thought on who she'll get to be the next head of basketball operations if Jim is let go. There really is only one choice for her most likely, but I shudder at the thought of him running our franchise into the ground. I mean he hasn't really showed he's capable of doing it NY, so why accept him here?"
lakers,3by3xu,misterrunon,3,Fri Jul 3 05:19:40 2015 UTC,"I agree that Jeanie isn't that great - you can tell by the way she speaks, that she isn't  entirely competent. But the issue with her posing for playboy is not a big deal. It happened 20 years ago.  She looks like she's had a ton of plastic surgery done though.. but even then, I don't care."
lakers,3by3xu,ryanm37,4,Fri Jul 3 11:07:06 2015 UTC,Who cares if she posed topless? What's that got to do with her business acumen?
lakers,3by3xu,clippjoint,2,Fri Jul 3 08:11:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly I love how he completely omits the part where she is responsible for that 5 billion dollar TV deal  w/ Time Warner and a renewal of radio broadcast with ESPN, and also the new Lakers state of the art training facility being built at El Segundo."

lakers,3by3xu,Rackstein,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:54:05 2015 UTC,It's hard for me to see how bad Jim Buss could be... I didn't really see any negative rhetoric until Dr Buss died and Bill Simmons wrote that tribute piece (which he then ended by slamming Jim).  I feel like it's pieces like that which end up shaping the narrative.
lakers,3by3xu,wafflecakes,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:25:17 2015 UTC,"As unfavorable as Jim Buss's decisions may have been, I have to give him credit for being as proactive as he can be with front-office actions. And Jeanie never brings up the ""deadline"" out of ill will, it's often brought to her; and, when she does reply, she sounds like she has Jim's back.  As a Lakers fan, I want this pressure. I believe in our new talent, and still feel blessed to have Kobe. Here's to growth and development."
lakers,3by3xu,ToberG,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:57:37 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day, I do believe that we will be in contention and reach at least the semi-finals within the next two years. And if it doesn't workout, then someone like Magic could step in and fill a more hands-on role in the organization and relieve the Buss family from some of the basketball related decisions. Mitch Kupchak is more than capable of pulling the right pieces together, and even though rebuilding often takes more than 5 years, we are yet to witness Randle's rookie season, as well as the combination of Clarkson and D'Angelo Russell.

Given the TV deals and the overall mass appeal of the Lakers (I could tell you first hand, growing up in the Balkans being 7 years old and staying up till 2am to watch the Lakers), if the team is not able to contend soon, they will explore all options including both Jeanie and Jim stepping down."

lakers,3c2boc,harryhov,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:35:36 2015 UTC,At first I was all game with the Kobe contra but now I'm just bitter. how could Mitch not know this would prevent us from getting two max players? You think people will play at a discount to be in LA? What you gonna preach? F'ing Sportsnet and AEG giving you a reality show? The weather? Give me a break.

lakers,3c2boc,Donkeykongalan,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:19:11 2015 UTC,Knowing it's over and there's nothing to do anymore now that the Kobe train has come to it's end. I wanted to like them too but all they did was find the shittiest players to play with Kobe and Shaq. Guess I owe them for that.
lakers,3c2boc,justsomeguy5,-1,Sat Jul 4 18:16:02 2015 UTC,I miss Dr. Buss. This shit would never happen with him around. No way he would sit on his hands for 3 straight seasons and not improve the team even a little bit.

lakers,3c35e8,darkshark21,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:05:30 2015 UTC,I agree that he is not. I've been saying since the draft not to do it for all the assets they want. I was curious if people saw the lakers maybe doing this in a panic since they've essentially missed out on any free agents.

lakers,3c35e8,StealthRUs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:56:01 2015 UTC,I don't see this happening.   It looks like we're committed to the rookie tank this year.  We can package our top 3 from next year to get someone to put alongside KD in 2016 or draft someone to play with Westbrook in 2017.
lakers,3bxv4n,YHWHandSon,48,Fri Jul 3 01:33:20 2015 UTC,This article is exactly what all of us sensible Laker fans have been saying. However it's easy for people to shit on popular franchises for clicks and reactions.
lakers,3bxv4n,BeefCat10,12,Fri Jul 3 01:39:25 2015 UTC,"I tell ya, I got friends who are fucking crazy, all mad that we didn't land LMA, or get DMC for scraps, as if Mitch could just wave a magic wand and get us a championship team even though he's got nothing to work with.  I was all for DMC when I thought we would get the 6 pick out of it, but now I'm glad we didn't pull the trigger.  I mean, that's how you end up like the Knicks, making those short-sighted trades like that.  Lakers will be fine; we'll develop this young core and then we'll bring in some outside talent to take us over the top"
lakers,3bxv4n,TuneHD,-12,Fri Jul 3 01:44:17 2015 UTC,"I won't lose sleep about missing out on LA, but I would definitely love to have Cousinss. Cousins/Randle/3&D guy/Clarkson/Russell would be fantastic"

lakers,3bxv4n,TuneHD,3,Fri Jul 3 04:34:43 2015 UTC,And also long enough that it's completely irrelevant to the discussions people are having right now?
lakers,3bxv4n,Ksanti,-1,Fri Jul 3 12:17:12 2015 UTC,"The discussion is people want FAs and to contend. The reality is, we aren't attracting anybody good enough to do that right now.

lakers,3bxv4n,Paladinoras,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:43:21 2015 UTC,Yes but the discussion around Boogie was because of rumors that he wanted out and that we were in the running to get him through a trade.  If you're talking about Boogie as a Free Agent you might as well be talking about Curry and Westbrook.
lakers,3bxv4n,sketchquark,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:50:43 2015 UTC,"If the conditions for the Cousins trade were true, it would have been Cousins/cheap FA/3 & D/Kobe's corpse/Ronnie frickin Price"

lakers,3bxv4n,Musingmike,2,Fri Jul 3 03:48:40 2015 UTC,Everybody freaking out right now needs to read this article.
lakers,3bxv4n,FuriousFlex,2,Fri Jul 3 04:19:33 2015 UTC,"Exactly my point. What sense is there putting extremely young talent with a thirty year old on a max contract? We'd have another huge hole to fill in four years, right when these players would looking at free agency.   The closest acquisition to make sense would have been Cousins, but I was never big on him either. He doesn't strike me as a transcendent big man, and nothing he's done shows me that he'll ever be that."
lakers,3bxv4n,metrofeed,7,Fri Jul 3 18:36:37 2015 UTC,Love won't live up to that contract. LMA is good but he is 30 and has never been past the 2nd round..  signing him doesn't instantly make the Lakers a contender.
lakers,3bxv4n,SSD65,3,Fri Jul 3 20:01:33 2015 UTC,"I don't get why they are after him... He will break down in a year or so, meanwhile our young players are going to be playoff ready. Then we are going to sit and say why did we give this contract to him."
lakers,3bxv4n,sayheykid24,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:32:57 2015 UTC,"Good article and I agree with the Aldridge remarks within it, but it isn't just big time free agents. It is a lack of signing even a 2nd tier free agent as well. The team is bare bones right now. It is really embarrassing to see not a single player want to sign with the lakers. Even the Knicks are gonna sign Lopez..."
lakers,3bxv4n,imadogg,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:52:10 2015 UTC,I don't get why we went after a 30 year old big PF that is on the decline in a year or so.. He wants to be in a situation to win now... Lakers is not that situation right now. Maybe in a few years YES! Once our young core (I Hope they ball out this year) can show this other players they are legit ! After that then players will want to come and play for LA. WE have just a unproven young talent now. In time boys give it a few years. and FK STERN! we could have had CP3 right now and made an attractive destination. but nooooo we need several years to find stars again and develop... 1 block trade cost us so many years.
lakers,3bxv4n,Rusty__Trombone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:59:54 2015 UTC,I was all for Aldridge but I thought dude was 28. That changed everything to me.
lakers,3bxv4n,realniggacologne,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:41:27 2015 UTC,"The one thing I feel people might be forgetting, which this article mentions, is that DMC is only 25, a beast at a very hard position to fill, and a potential superstar. I would be fine with trading SOME of our few assets to acquire such a player.   Had we drafted someone like Okafor or even Towns, our wish would be that in a few years he turns into DMC.   That said I don't see that FA next year or even the year after give us a ton of reasons to hope. So yes, keep the young kids and see what shakes out of other teams, but if the Lakers don't have a strong core by next season or the season after, they are in the exact same position they are now of not being a contender."
lakers,3bxv4n,nikkus,0,Fri Jul 3 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"Sign and trade for Hibbert. Move Swaggy and Kelly. Then take David Lee's salary, only if they give us Looney. Finally, try to sign Tobias Harris. I would be happy with this."
lakers,3bxv4n,nikkus,5,Fri Jul 3 09:18:05 2015 UTC,Can't sign and trade for Hibbert because he's not a free agent.
lakers,3bxv4n,readem_n_weep,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:27:37 2015 UTC,Just trade for him them. I would actually take Hibbert who the Pacers have been badly trying to give away if they'll take Swaggy (and Kelly or whatever). It actually doesn't sound that outlandish. The trade would work because we're under the cap. And his contract expires after this year. Didn't even think about it.  Hope Kobe and everyone would be able to get him into shape though and he wouldn't suck ass again. We would need his defense and immense size next to Randle.
lakers,3bxv4n,nikkus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:35:30 2015 UTC,I agree
lakers,3bxv4n,badguymatt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:12:15 2015 UTC,"I'd only take a player like Lee if we got draft picks. I'd also rather wait a year and let Randle and Russell grow, then try to get a FA next summer.  I don't believe Aldridge or Love are the solution to this Laker mess.  I would rather tank one more year, let the young guys play and develop, then get a top ten pick in the draft.  I would hate the Lakers to overpay a 30 year old with a max deal unless he is the guy to put us over the top to win a championship."
lakers,3c2szx,gpholmes1,0,Sat Jul 4 05:50:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my only worry is that they get desperate and make a really shortsighted win now move by trading one of the young guys."
lakers,3c2szx,JustAGuy993,3,Sat Jul 4 05:53:06 2015 UTC,"This is why this whole ""2 year"" proclaimation by Jim Buss scares me.  Why put uneeded pressure on yourself to win in such a short window?  Focus on developing the team and be patient; don't sacrifice the future for some delusion of winning the finals right now."
lakers,3c2szx,JustAGuy993,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:55:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, and Jeanie brilliantly keeps bringing it to the forefront of the media every few months to add to that pressure.  If they trade one or more of these guys for anything less than a Cousins level talent I'm done spending money on this team until they sell."
lakers,3c2szx,StealthRUs,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:58:17 2015 UTC,Yes.  It's very wrong and completely unrealistic for you to think that.
lakers,3c2omp,terryd24,3,Sat Jul 4 05:00:53 2015 UTC,Well they have a max guy who can produce to that level (before his surgery) and the Lakers have an old max guy. They're in a better situation. If Kobe ends up staying he's gonna need to take way less money.
lakers,3c2omp,AndrewNava,3,Sat Jul 4 05:43:48 2015 UTC,"Knicks have done a good job. Afflalo, Derrick Williams and Robin Lopez are solid Mid Level players that can produce for them immediately. and the good part is they didnt really overpay for them"
lakers,3c2omp,NicDwolfwood,6,Sat Jul 4 05:50:35 2015 UTC,"Aside from R Lopez, I don't see value in locking up your cap on the other players."
lakers,3c2omp,harryhov,4,Sat Jul 4 05:03:29 2015 UTC,"They improved the talent level of the team to begin to really rebuild the Knicks franchise because Phil was smart enough to understand that trying to sign a max level star to pair was Carmelo was a waste of time. It's what the Lakers should have done, but didn't like idiots.  Knicks improved their team drastically while also preserving some cap space and will be able to chase more talent next year with the cap increase too. They're in a way better situation than the Lakers are, which is not something I would have said 4 days ago."
lakers,3c2omp,justsomeguy5,4,Sat Jul 4 05:39:44 2015 UTC,I think getting Afflalo for 2yr/16mil is a pretty solid deal as well.
lakers,3c2omp,p321p,2,Sat Jul 4 05:10:36 2015 UTC,"It's a decent deal to get a starting caliber wing on your team.   How ever the second year is a player option. So if Afflalo plays well and remains healthy, I can see him opting out to get a bigger pay day."
lakers,3c2omp,harryhov,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:10:47 2015 UTC,I forgot about him.
lakers,3c2omp,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Sat Jul 4 05:50:15 2015 UTC,"You call Afflalo and Lopez good signings? Those guys are mediocre. Afflalo they got him at a good price, but Lopez they paid way too much even w/ the cap going up, still. He doesn't do anything exceptionally well. Knicks were being desperate. Knicks are gonna have trouble scoring outside of Melo unless Porzingis shocks the hell out of the world and brings out his inner Dirk. They'll be much better defensively obviously."

lakers,3bwrbj,mike1883,94,Thu Jul 2 21:45:29 2015 UTC,Like Mason and Ireland said on their show today. This is just damage control. I can see how it will play out. Lamarcus will attend the meeting and then you will hear from the media that Lakers felt it went well (again). Then you will hear from Lamarcus' camp saying they were also impressed and it will be a tough decision. Ultimately he will end up in San Antonio. Don't get your hopes up guys :( As a Lakers fan I feel this is more embarrassing than when we put up that billboard asking Dwight to stay. Its sad that we have to have a second meeting with Lamarcus even though we know he is going to San Antonio. It seems very desperate.
lakers,3bwrbj,arch_wizard,20,Thu Jul 2 20:40:27 2015 UTC,I agree but at very least this gives F/O opportunity to get the presentation right and self reflect on the futility and inanity of concentrating on off the court opportunities aka distractions.

Now at 30, I'm sure he's asking ""will this get me a ring"". LA is a legit dude with a focus on basketball. You can tell in all of his interviews he's passionate about what he does.   I understand pitching Hollywood to a guy like Howard, but not LA."
lakers,3bwrbj,evsoul,5,Thu Jul 2 21:13:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah but on the other hand this is just more time spent on a guy who won't come to our team.

lakers,3bwrbj,FuriousFlex,2,Thu Jul 2 22:01:22 2015 UTC,Not everyone wants that. Some players want to be confident that Mitch already knows what players will compliment LMA and has a plan to make it happen. The reality is that there's a very good possibility that nothing we can say will work because there are a few teams which are just better options to LMA.

lakers,3bwrbj,FuriousFlex,6,Thu Jul 2 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"I just hope that we fail again, because I already bought the idea that we are not going anywhere even if we land him. He's a skilled 30 year old player, I don't know how relevant his addition is going to be for the team in the long run. Even if we sign with him, I believe we wouldn't even make the playoffs (potential Dwightmare 2.0 ?) so the best option at this point seems to be focusing on the development of our young talent, hoping that they prove themselves until the next summer. Perhaps Russell can go all Stephen Curry and Julius Randle reveals himself as a much improved version of Lamarcus Aldridge. After figuring out the role of all of our prospects, we could then go for a huge young FA signing (preferably a Center) since we would have, hypothetically, a more solidified core to make a championship run."
lakers,3bwrbj,Lyqu1d,3,Thu Jul 2 20:28:49 2015 UTC,"I agree that the upside of getting him might not be that high. But this isn't a trade, this is a free agency signing, and he is a great contract (borderline superstar on the max).  In general, getting top tier free agents for free (as in, not having to trade assets) is always a good idea. Evaluating him as ""he's only the 15th best player in the league and is 30"" is not relevant, because again, we don't have to trade players or picks to get him.   It won't come down to this, but at any point we could trade his contract for multiple assets and first round picks. Getting a star player on a relatively good max (rising cap in 2016) drastically increases the teams assets and expected wins in the future."
lakers,3bwrbj,rjvir,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:16:11 2015 UTC,"I see your point and of course his addition to the team can bring decent upsides, by either gathering trade value or attractiveness to our franchise. I just hope that it won't turn into a Dwightmare once again. That would hurt our young talent pretty bad."
lakers,3bwrbj,Lyqu1d,2,Thu Jul 2 21:34:55 2015 UTC,"True. Luckily if we got him it would be for probably at least 3 years so it wouldn't be as bad as Dwight. Also, from the outsider fan perspective, Lamarcus seems like a better locker room presence than Dwight.   But you do bring up good points - he's high usage (at mediocre efficiency) and doesn't solve our defensive woes. In the short term we will still suck and he could take away from other developing players."
lakers,3bwrbj,rjvir,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:54:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was a nice discussion. Let's hope for the best and wait for the buzz to settle down. Anyways - GO LAKERS!"
lakers,3bwrbj,Lyqu1d,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:12:56 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest positive would be allowing the young guys to be on a team that is at least competitive for the next couple years. Russell, Randle, and Clarkson will grow and improve regardless, but another couple seasons of 20-win basketball might really create a pretty negative and ho-hum atmosphere. With Aldridge we will immediately be at least a competitive team every night and out of tank mode (which doesn't help us because next year's pick is top-3 protected anyway).  We just can't just sit back and expect the big-name FAs to turn us into a title contender every year anymore. We need to build from the ground up again -- and instilling a competitive mentality for the young guys is key to that."
lakers,3bwrbj,camlawson24,4,Thu Jul 2 21:18:14 2015 UTC,I almost completely agree with you. But don't you forget that when it comes to winning mentality and work ethic our young players already have one hell of a role model to follow.  Kobe Bryant.
lakers,3bwrbj,Lyqu1d,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:32:18 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, but even a healthy Kobe might only lead this team to 20/25 wins as currently constructed. He can set the example but if we're still losing 3 out of 4 games it's going to create a poor atmosphere."
lakers,3bwrbj,camlawson24,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:27:57 2015 UTC,I agree. The whole situation has become a clusterfuck that makes us look desperate. Our team image has taken a big hit from this.

This social media reporting is not even close to reliable. Who are these bullshit sources?

lakers,3bxrwa,hanni90,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:20:31 2015 UTC,"Not really a front office issue, it's more of a 'we can't contend for championships every single year without rebuilding'.

lakers,3byb33,Scabandiri,17,Fri Jul 3 03:59:11 2015 UTC,Probably means we are looking into the possibiity of trading for cousins
lakers,3byb33,Billcosbyspuddingpop,2,Fri Jul 3 04:00:28 2015 UTC,The Kings aren't trading Cousins -- they just traded all their draft capital so they don't want to tank and give their firsts to Philly.
lakers,3byb33,mcorcoran3,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:10:49 2015 UTC,"I would imagine this is the only scenario in which we go for Rondo. Fortunately Rondo's value could be at an all time low, so now might be the time to snag him for a reasonable contract, but with team options"
lakers,3byb33,sketchquark,2,Fri Jul 3 05:25:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I certainly don't want to pay a primetime price for him, I feel like he needs to re-prove himself.  That said, anything we can do to free up Kobe to play pure Shooting Guard without overly depending on him to be a playmaker is good. Given his injury record and general fitness levels over the last three years we need to be conservative with his minutes and free him up to be a mid-range jumper machine through the season."
lakers,3byb33,SwirlPiece_McCoy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:27:36 2015 UTC,But why do we even care about Kobe getting his shots off at this point? Our main priority should be to develop our young guys and I can't picture a scenario where having Kobe be our first option helps with any of that. He's not getting another title with us as much as he'd like to believe so. I think appeasing him at this point will just lead to more outbursts from him that could hurt our younger guy's confidence and spirit.
lakers,3byb33,Occitzer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:00:16 2015 UTC,I believe rondo already said he was only considering 1 year contracts.

lakers,3byb33,Ksanti,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:16:17 2015 UTC,This is actually very unlikely because Kings are pursuing Rondo as well. They can just sign him themselves with the tremendous cap they have - especially after Wes Matthews turned down 16 mill a year with them. We really have no more leverage in a Cousins trade.

Our biggest FA signing was Derek Fisher, who was definitely an improvement from Smush Parker, but overall, that year was pretty disappointing. There was so much talk about Kobe wanting to leave because of the trash that we were surrounding him with. Luckily, we traded for Pau and Ariza months later and the rest was history.  This summer's definitely up there though. Let's see how the season plays out. Unlikely we have anywhere near the success that we did in 2008, and the two subsequent years afterwards though."

lakers,3c1b2c,Akashady47,3,Fri Jul 3 22:36:41 2015 UTC,"What the fuck are you talking about. His contract is just a couple million more than what other max players make. And he is worth it. No one expected him to have 3 season ending injuries. Do you not remember literally 3 years ago we were in the playoffs. We had Dwight Pau Artest Kobe and Nash? Calm the fuck down dude. His contract is not the reason we suck. We suck because of horrible injury plagued teams, busts, rookies and just hit a rut. We're 5 years off of a championship run. Other teams haven't won EVER. calm down and just enjoy watching the game. Watch our youth develop and watch other teams play. You don't have to cheer them but at least respect the game and watch it"

The NBA has changed and we didn't change with it.   3) Kobe is kinda above basketball at this point, but I still don't think we should have given him all of that money for what he already has."

Sucking horribly last season with garbage like Lin, Wes, Boozer, Hill, Sacre, etc was hard to watch, but we kept our pick because of it and lucked out by having it jump in the lottery. This upcoming season, although we, most likely, will be towards the bottom of the league again and have far worse odds to keep the 2016 pick this time around, watching Russell, Randle, and Clarkson get ample playing time is going to be far more watchable.   Hoping like hell Kobe plays at least 60 games too. I want him to be able to go out on his own terms and not because of some horse shit injury."

But, Kobe has only recently got out of his prime and the rebuild has only been in year 1.  The FA period tact taken sucks, but modern FA period is a mess anyways when you look at the fluctuating contracts and the high frequency of it all and the politics involved.   The LAL are always going to be at a disadvantage there bc a single FA can disrupt a great percentage of the LAL FA signings and dictate poor trades, etc. In fact, it would not surprise me if some small market (SAS, Pheonix, Mavs etc) knew they'd sign LMA and just trojan horsed him.  All that along with CA being the highest state income taxed in the league give me hope that a new CBA will give LAL a more equal shot at FA next time the team rebuilds...which might be soon bc Jim and Mitch are def. not going to fulfill their promise, and a new crop of LAL FO execs will include some rebuild plan in their process.

With that said however, the amount of money given to those guys wouldn't have allowed us to pay both of them. The REAL issue in my opinion lies with Kobe's contract. As everyone points out, the reasons for giving Kobe the ridiculous contract have been contradicted. His contract really cripples us for trying to accumulate quality players that potential free agents would want to team up with. Its funny because someone who was against giving Kobe the inflated contract was none other than Jim Buss."

We aren't even rebuilding if we don't have    he's not the scape goat, Mitch and Kobe are the scapegoats. Jim and Jeanie fighting has ruined the FA."

Let our young guys shine this year and then next year FAs will be interested in playing with them...plus Kobe can come back for minimum.

lakers,3by7dp,kingtarzan,3,Fri Jul 3 14:53:05 2015 UTC,I don't think he's coming back. If he does he should take the minimum. We shouldn't sign him otherwise.

lakers,3by7dp,readem_n_weep,3,Fri Jul 3 16:43:14 2015 UTC,Well there's a difference between taking less and taking the minimum. Taking 7-10 mill a year is a pretty steep cut and would make a huge difference.
lakers,3by7dp,Chilled_Penguin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:53:09 2015 UTC,I'm thinking he should be starting but playing 6th man minutes and maybe less. It may be the only way to keep him healthy.  I'm being downvoted for saying Kobe should be taking the minimum but he has barely contributed anything in the last two years. Just keeping him on the roster is giving him respect as a legend.

lakers,3by7dp,Sickfire22,2,Fri Jul 3 03:36:07 2015 UTC,"Kobe comes off the books next year (as far as his payback contract is concerned), the rookies are all super promising and Nick Young's contract wont be so silly once the cap goes up.   I don't give a fuck if questionable contracts can get us from 35 wins to 45. Lakers are about championships, and picking up questionable contracts and inhibited coordinated contract opportunities next season is the last thing we want to do.

lakers,3by7dp,Ksanti,0,Fri Jul 3 12:21:29 2015 UTC,You also need to remember that championship teams aren't just built overnight. We need to at least show that we have some capability beyond winning just 20 games. We need to at least show that were being serious and put together solid role players and then we can look at the superstars.

How the hell did Robin choose Nyk over LA?!    He was the most reasonable big man that I thought we could actually use. I've been patient but I can't believe we were spurned by Robin Lopez.     Unless he wants to live close to his brother,  I can't see a significant advantage of playing with the Knicks over the Lakers."
lakers,3by7dp,LowkeyAnushole,3,Fri Jul 3 04:41:52 2015 UTC,I'm assuming the Lakers are still holding out to save room to offer a max to either DJ or LA. The Knicks were a sure deal so he locked it up. Which sucks because we aren't getting either of those two.
lakers,3by7dp,wwgaray,3,Fri Jul 3 05:12:02 2015 UTC,"He signed with Knicks contingent on them not getting DJ, so the Lakers could've done that too."
lakers,3by7dp,mcorcoran3,2,Fri Jul 3 11:06:25 2015 UTC,"That makes sense.  Hate that LA is missing out on the solid B level players but if you can get a homerun, you have to go for it"
lakers,3by7dp,LowkeyAnushole,2,Fri Jul 3 05:16:54 2015 UTC,It just sucks that our two options are a) sign B/C players and give up on maxing out LA or DJ before hearing back from them or b) wait for them to make a decision but lose out on B/C players and most likely LA and DJ too. Tough situation the Lakers front office is in right now.
lakers,3by7dp,wwgaray,2,Fri Jul 3 05:36:40 2015 UTC,"It really does suck.   This is part of the reason I originally wanted to draft okafor because I knew it was going to be much harder (and more expensive) to get a quality big in free agency than it would be to get a good wing or guard,  but I trust the FO to draft the right player."
lakers,3by7dp,LowkeyAnushole,2,Fri Jul 3 14:59:50 2015 UTC,NYC is a pretty awesome city so it makes sense. It's more upsetting that Monroe chose Milwaukee over LA
lakers,3by7dp,windmuffin,2,Fri Jul 3 14:47:14 2015 UTC,"I never really wanted Monroe anyway.   If we were going to sign a B player,  I wanted someone that fit the mold of what we needed and outside of physically playing center,   Monroe doesn't do much of what we actually needed from the center position.   Plus he would have required a max to come here too. Lopez was my dark horse to fill our needs well while not sucking up all of our cap space."

lakers,3byhiq,Havok-Devastator,2,Fri Jul 3 05:09:25 2015 UTC,Won't he be the starter? Or who?
lakers,3byhiq,Reply_Hazy,3,Fri Jul 3 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"As of right now he will be. I wouldn't be surprised if we give Jordan Hill a call though, honestly. They'd probably split the time. Hopefully Upshaw will pan out, but I don't see him starting this season."

lakers,3c0x4p,badguymatt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:29:39 2015 UTC,I haven't seen anything about teams reaching out to Hill. That should tell you everything you need to know.   Ed Davis would have been better to keep but maybe the FO thinks Upshaw and Tariq are all we need??
lakers,3c0x4p,badguymatt,2,Fri Jul 3 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"Ed would have been nice to keep. Shit, he even stated after he accepted that deal with Portland that he wanted to return to LA, but wasn't just going to wait around forever. I don't blame him. We fucked up there."

I hope we don't sign Koufos, Biyombo, Hill and Amare just to sign someone for signing's sake. With the exception of Amare, who might be a good sign at the mid-level range, these guys just aren't any good. Biyombo? Have you guys seen him play?  I don't think we're getting any of the remaining big names (LMA, Harris, DJ), and that's okay tbh -- I'd rather watch a fun, young team and let the core 3 + Upshaw develop than watch Biyombo take up space.

lakers,3c0ver,rejectx,6,Fri Jul 3 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"Swaggy's definitely done us some favors in contract negotiations. We do have him on a nice contract. Granted that depends on if he plays like he did the years prior to last. Last year he didn't really seem like he wanted to be out there. And when he was he looked good, but he was also way too content with our struggles. If he puts in more work and actually shows a bit of drive and motivation, his 5mill ain't shit."
lakers,3c0ver,badguymatt,2,Fri Jul 3 19:28:16 2015 UTC,"That all depends on how well Nick Young plays this year.  If he can be an efficient scorer off the bench and play average defense then nobody SHOULD have a problem with him.  It still made 0 sense to sign him to that contract last year with the idea of ""competing"" though."
lakers,3c0ver,wanderfound,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:20:36 2015 UTC,"It's a good contract, but I think not all of the problem last year was injury and bad play.  He was really motivated two years ago when he was only playing for $1mil and in a contract year, I also think being in MDA's system helped inflate his stats some.    It really pissed me off when it came out that he is constantly being fined for being late.  If he's getting paid millions to play a game he supposedly loves, he should be in the gym early trying to improve or at least show up on time and pretend to give his best effort.  He seems to be really enjoying being a Laker and all the fame and exposure that goes with it, but doesn't seem to care nearly as much about his effort on and off the court.  Yeah he's got a great contract if he can have a bounce back year, but I really don't want his sense of entitlement or bad work ethic rubbing off on our young players.    I'm on the fence about him, I think there's no reason to trade him now while his value is low and we don't have any use for that money.  If he puts in the work and plays well I'll be happy to have him around, but if he continues to goofy off and basketball remains his second priority I think it's best to cut ties with him.    I haven't heard about him putting in work at the gym all offseason, so I'm not too optimistic."

lakers,3bymle,ChrisKamanMyEye,7,Fri Jul 3 05:47:00 2015 UTC,can you post a direct image link because the instagram post is private
lakers,3bymle,Taskmaster24,4,Fri Jul 3 07:37:21 2015 UTC,He looks like he's in shape. Now if we can just get some decent FA's and Kobe returns to form we will still be fun to watch whether or not we make the playoffs.
lakers,3bymle,TheAsianMamba,3,Fri Jul 3 05:51:04 2015 UTC,we were pretty competitive last season. just couldn't close games. maybe a healthy kobe changes that.
lakers,3bymle,lars5,5,Fri Jul 3 06:06:27 2015 UTC,"He looks good, but damn Vanessa is looking fine af."
lakers,3bzw6k,duragjones,19,Fri Jul 3 14:35:49 2015 UTC,"Best case scenario next season is Randle, Clarkson and Russell display unbelievable chemistry, play out of their minds and win almost 50 games, barely miss the playoffs, and beat the odds and get the 3rd pick in the lottery."

lakers,3bzw6k,streetsweepskeet,2,Fri Jul 3 16:02:57 2015 UTC,"That would be even better scenario haha. I'm pretty certain we won't get our own pick even if we get sub 15 wins. I'm just hoping for 30+ wins I'd think it's be enough for max players to take a flyer on us, I'd also like to see our young core each averaging double figures in points"
lakers,3bzw6k,santokimilktea,2,Fri Jul 3 14:44:36 2015 UTC,You kind of said best case scenario so he's not really wrong there :)
lakers,3bzw6k,ss3happy1,2,Fri Jul 3 16:13:50 2015 UTC,LOL yup this would bring tears of joy! Although the best case scenario would also have Kobe rejuvenated and averaging 25 a game in addition to the emergence of our rookies. Then we draft Simmons and Kobe takes a paycut next season so we sign a big time FA.  It's fun being outrageously optimistic!!!

lakers,3bzw6k,Tbuckelew,3,Fri Jul 3 15:16:58 2015 UTC,"If things stay the way they are, we're on track for the worst record in the league. We might have some stiff competition considering the 76'ers are the masters of losing. Best case scenario is that our rookies so their potential and we keep are pick. Which we'll have a 65% chance of doing with the worst record."
lakers,3bzw6k,KookLife,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:44:33 2015 UTC,"If Embiid is healthy to play next year, I think Nerlens, Okafor, Embiid is enough to make them a little better next year. Even the Knicks might be better than us with their recent signings. Our tank record will really depend on how much time Kobe plays. If he goes down early, we need to commit and develop our rookies. If he plays the full season we will be 2nd-3rd worst, and hand over a prime pick to the 76ers. I'm expecting to see a lot of Upshaw and Black next season!"
lakers,3bzw6k,justsomeguy5,2,Fri Jul 3 17:50:39 2015 UTC,Best case scenario is to lose more games than they did last season to keep the pick. The Lakers will likely do that anyway though.
lakers,3bzw6k,sillymath22,2,Fri Jul 3 16:01:03 2015 UTC,I hope it'd be an unexpected surprise if somehow they kept their pick and got Simmons I'd be ectastic
lakers,3bzw6k,kenn4000,2,Fri Jul 3 17:00:54 2015 UTC,Look at how deep the west is. I think it will be very hard for a rookie team to win against any of those teams. Its going to be another tough year. Best case would be that lakers are competitive in every game but still get a top 3 pick.

lakers,3bxgu5,Akvc8,10,Thu Jul 2 23:33:27 2015 UTC,Pay him 3 yrs/23 mil and get this over with
lakers,3bxgu5,Laker_Junkie,2,Fri Jul 3 00:06:43 2015 UTC,this actually sounds about right to me. maybe even entice him with a player option for year 3. we can't roll into the season with sacre as our only guy over 6'10

lakers,3bxgu5,delscorch0,4,Fri Jul 3 00:04:30 2015 UTC,I'd like this if they can get him on a good value contract.  The Lakers can offer PT at the 5 ...

lakers,3bxgu5,Musingmike,3,Fri Jul 3 00:15:00 2015 UTC,"Lopez is going to the Knicks most likely. Not official yet, but the rumor mill has him being close to signing. Koufos is a guy I don't know much about on the rumor mill though. He may sign..."

lakers,3c2miz,USCTrojanMJB,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:35:29 2015 UTC,"So because west drafted Kobe and Kobe is still the leader of this team, no matter what happens, it's because of West."
lakers,3c2miz,likwidsage,2,Sat Jul 4 04:43:59 2015 UTC,"That's absolutely right. That decision altered the 2 decades that followed. He brought this franchise one of the greatest players in NBA history for the price of Vlade Divac, a guy who smokes 2 packs of cigs everyday. How many of your Laker memories has Kobe provided? One of the most entertaining players of all time. Heck yeah, West deserves credit for everything this franchise does on the back of Kobe's individual greatness."
lakers,3c2miz,likwidsage,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:23:20 2015 UTC,"There's one problem. That means there isn't anything anyone can possibly do that'll get credit for it until Kobe retires, because he'll always be the leader."
lakers,3c2miz,harryhov,2,Sat Jul 4 05:33:52 2015 UTC,"Not true. Obviously it's hard to fathom, but there are players Kobe would be willing to pass the torch to. Pau wasn't one, mostly because Kobe was still ultra effective. At this point, he knows he's losing his Alpha status. I don't think anyone that's been available is worthy of the keys to the franchise though."
lakers,3c2miz,BdayMassacre,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:14:43 2015 UTC,My concern is we really have no assets we can trade. All the rookies are too valuable to trade and no expiring contracts. We should've secured the services of support players instead of trying to hit the home run with A list FA.
lakers,3c2miz,NicDwolfwood,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:51:36 2015 UTC,"We're committed to the rebuild. No question. I'm not sure we should've just ignored the big names, but they clearly didn't get a good gauge on what each player's motivating factor was. Pretty disappointing. It's one thing to miss out, and another thing completely to miss out mostly because you didn't understand what was important to the player."
lakers,3c2miz,harryhov,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:46:45 2015 UTC,Didn't West also say Russell is the most talented player in the draft?  At least there's that
lakers,3c2miz,riceballa,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:15:53 2015 UTC,"My Concern has always been on the guy that is currently running the show, Jim Buss.   As soon as he cleaned house and fired lifers in the front office, people who had worked there for three decades and replaced them with his buddies, i knew shit was going downhill fast.   The hiring of D'Antoni over Phil Jackson was the nail in the coffin. they hired a coach to coach a team that didnt have the pieces to fit his philosophy. and he was unwilling to play to his teams strenghts, which led to all kinds of disaster  The big concern is that the Lakers are so far from even being respectable that its almost insulting that they have been promising a better product since 2 years ago and have failed to deliver. 05 and 06 was nothing compared to this. So they've struck out on major free agents 2 years running, and also let plenty of mid level players sign elsewhere and let good players leave the Lakers for other teams. they did that with Jodie Meeks last year, did it with Ed Davis this year. did with Ariza in 09, did it with Earl Clark in 2012 so its a track record of underappreciating good players for them, and signing very little players to improve the squad."

lakers,3bx9oq,Musingmike,13,Thu Jul 2 22:32:06 2015 UTC,Look how fast things are going. Players and spots are being signed/taken up VERY fast. You can't wait around unless you are a top tier guy with teams waiting to get word of your decision...like Aldridge.

lakers,3bx9oq,BeefCat10,6,Thu Jul 2 22:33:31 2015 UTC,I like Ed but this could end up being a mistake. Especially if the Lakers were going to give him the starting job on a team that would have made him look even better than he actually is.

lakers,3bx9oq,ss3happy1,3,Thu Jul 2 23:26:24 2015 UTC,"Yea you're on the right track tho, why would we take Lee's awful contract for free? And GSW has no picks to give unlike the Rockets and Lin last year"
lakers,3bx9oq,rejectx,3,Fri Jul 3 01:16:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah and even if they did, those picks would be unlikely to produce anything of value.   Speaking of declining, non-defense-playing PFs, I hope we don't re-sign Boozer."

We can't always get what we want,  from either perspective."

lakers,3bx9oq,fucky0urkarma,8,Thu Jul 2 22:58:05 2015 UTC,"Free agency is not comparable to that whatsoever. Terrible example. Free agency also moves very fast. If he wants options, he has to sign fast. I'm sure there may have been a part of him which wanted to sign, but ultimately he made a good decision his part to be part of a competitive team and get paid. Can't bash him for that."
lakers,3bx9oq,Darkseid_Omega,2,Fri Jul 3 00:44:52 2015 UTC,Don't know how the Blazers are a competitive team.   Ro-Lo is gone.   Afflalo is gone.  Wes Matt is gone.  LMA is gone.   Nic Batum is gone.   Would've been better if Ed Davis signed with us.
lakers,3bx9oq,fucky0urkarma,0,Fri Jul 3 05:44:50 2015 UTC,"If he wants options, he has to sign fast.   i dont get that logic. if he signs fast, he's ignoring all other potential options."
lakers,3bx9oq,SPMrFantastic,6,Fri Jul 3 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"He's trying to say, if he wants to catch windows while they're open, he has to act quickly. Lets be frank here-- Ed Davis isn't an all-star and the prospect of losing a sure thing somewhere else while possibly being burned by the Lakers didn't seem like a good one. It's a completely understandable and prudent career move."

Ed played the safe route and accepted UCLA."
lakers,3bx9oq,C3PO1Fan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:19:23 2015 UTC,that sounds fucking stupid considering that contracts wont be signed until the 9th. and its barely day 2 of free agency
lakers,3bx9oq,KookLife,6,Thu Jul 2 22:34:28 2015 UTC,"He made is intentions known to the Lakers long before opting out of his contract. The Lakers have had months to resign Ed David. Instead, we wasted all of our time and effort on the big free agents that aren't going to come."
lakers,3bx9oq,C3PO1Fan,5,Thu Jul 2 22:40:29 2015 UTC,"If they had signed him out of the gate, it would've limited their flexibility.  Ed Davis is well within his rights to not want to wait that process out (in fact he absolutely should capitalize on sure thing money because for all he knows the Lakers might do an S/T or something and not have room for him and leave him out in the cold), but the Lakers at this stage need to keep that flexibility.  It was really a situation where neither side could really meet the other's needs."
lakers,3bx9oq,NicDwolfwood,2,Fri Jul 3 01:50:53 2015 UTC,"That's valid, but he signed for 6.5/yr, which was lower than what was leaked our earlier (7-10). I get that they wanted some flexibility, but they need to wake up and be realistic on their free agent options. We have a cast of rookies and Sacre is our most experienced center, did they really think LMA et al would go for that?"
lakers,3bx9oq,poops__everywhere,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:01:35 2015 UTC,"They did that last year, signed Jordan Hill before he could go and people freaked out."

lakers,3bx9oq,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,-1,Fri Jul 3 04:41:36 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like he didn't want to be in LA. Didn't even give the lakers the courtesy of waiting more than two days? Enjoy the wonderful city of Portland, Ed."

lakers,3bwwe6,realniggacologne,-6,Fri Jul 3 00:22:46 2015 UTC,They chose today...one of the most embarrassing days in Lakers history to release this news bite.  We are not signing a single fucking free agent so there plan is let's release the summer league team instead.
lakers,3by8yt,duragjones,11,Fri Jul 3 03:39:20 2015 UTC,Salary dumps. Yes. More picks.
lakers,3by8yt,readem_n_weep,6,Fri Jul 3 03:42:38 2015 UTC,draft picks is what they need. Only way for them to bring in talent.
lakers,3by8yt,MikeMcNorv,5,Fri Jul 3 03:43:16 2015 UTC,yes get a first round pick back if possible
lakers,3by8yt,thegetawayplan9,3,Fri Jul 3 03:54:45 2015 UTC,Not Joe Johnson. He doesn't even fit on our salary cap
lakers,3by8yt,TheAsianMamba,4,Fri Jul 3 03:40:37 2015 UTC,And the Nets are desperate for draft picks themselves.
lakers,3by8yt,dadiomcduck,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:28:36 2015 UTC,but they're also desperate for cap relief (or at least they should be)
lakers,3by8yt,checkag,2,Fri Jul 3 19:37:38 2015 UTC,"No, we're one year away from having all the cap space in the world.  Unless you mean players with one year remaining, then it's no.  Expiring contracts are worth something and it doesn't make sense to trade something of value for a rental when we have no intention of making a championship run."
lakers,3by8yt,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,2,Fri Jul 3 04:05:30 2015 UTC,Even with all the money in the world NO ONE is signing with us we at least needed one decent pickup this season to get a foot in the door but with each passing hour it seems less and less likely
lakers,3by8yt,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,2,Fri Jul 3 04:07:11 2015 UTC,"Why?  What is one signing going to do?  Nothing.  Look at the caliber of players this offseason that have legitimate chances of leaving their team, outside of Aldridge, there aint shit.  Why the hell would you wanna sign somebody for the sake of signing somebody?  That's a desperate move, that's the shit I don't wanna see.  The plan has been 2016 for a while now, just because we seriously went after one player, doesn't mean that's still not the plan."
lakers,3by8yt,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,2,Fri Jul 3 04:10:11 2015 UTC,"I've been wanting him ever since the rumors of him wanting to cash in on his Nike? Endorsement and come to a large market team like the lakers, his stats are nice and he's only 22 even if randle and Russell live up to expectation (which I doubt both will) we still need to round out the roster. Or are you ok with the Wesleys and sacres of the league"
lakers,3by8yt,lufty574,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:14:13 2015 UTC,Who's he?  Joe Johnson and David Lee certainly aren't 22 years old.

lakers,3by8yt,dalas3322,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:20:52 2015 UTC,"I'm for it, but for the right price.  People keep talking about max contracts for everybody."
lakers,3by8yt,starcraft_writer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:18:23 2015 UTC,Tbh that'd the only way we can get him besides we'd still have around 10 mil left for the year and next offseason Kobe comes off the bus and the cap is rising even if we grow the Mac at Tobias well still have 40mil to play with
lakers,3by8yt,KennyPOV,2,Fri Jul 3 14:23:21 2015 UTC,So what should we tell KD? To leave his championship contending team to go waste his prime on a team that is 3-4 years away from contending. Fuck that.
lakers,3by8yt,Buckelroo,3,Fri Jul 3 04:45:23 2015 UTC,"To leave his championship contending team to go waste his prime on a team that is 3-4 years away from contending.   He's been on that ""championship contending team"" for his entire career.  And I'm not sure where you've been, but we just so happen to have a couple of nice shiny pieces that can pan out and be something special.  And if Durant were to come to this team, we wouldn't be 3-4 years away.  Especially if he comes with another max player."
lakers,3by8yt,Toomuchgamin,3,Fri Jul 3 05:17:56 2015 UTC,"What shiny pieces are you talking about? Russell is something special but Randle hasn't even played a fucking game and Clarkson put up numbers on a shitty team for half a season. KD isn't stupid and wouldn't leave a team with Westbrook, Ibaka, Steven Adams, and Kanter for our team that is still years away from winning anything. Stop being a delusional homer and be realistic for a change. I mean just listen to yourself, you really think he's leaving a team he went to the finals with for a team that just came off another tanking season? Hell if I were him, I'd go to Washington instead. It is honestly hilarious you think our shiny pieces are enough to attract two max players, I envy your delusion/optimism."

lakers,3bxf9i,ByTheBeardOfBruce,-2,Fri Jul 3 00:42:17 2015 UTC,The tank train continues
lakers,3by8m1,BeefCat10,11,Fri Jul 3 03:36:16 2015 UTC,"Mitch didn't have a lot to work with.  The Lakers just had the worst season in Franchise history.  While the Lakers have a solid core of rookies and talent, that talent will take time to develop.  To any player who is looking to win now rather than later, the Lakers just aren't a good destination.  Getting a superstar can allow you to recruit a second one later.  It's why Mitch was trying so hard to get one.  Not only do superstars bring in more money for the organization, it can shorten a rebuild by attracting more superstars.  Signing mid level talent might get us more wins next year.  But the Lakers won't make the playoffs with that.  It doesn't make the Lakers a better destination than before unless they can be key components of a future bench.  So if the Lakers do sign them, it's for the future and we want them to be as cheap as possible so there is plenty of cap space for the starters.  Mitch is thinking long term where many lakers fans just want to win now or tank now.  He knows there is no point in tanking this season but he also knows the Lakers would need a miracle to make the playoffs in the West with this squad.  Most of the big free agents were long shots at best.  Mitch did his due diligence and tried to land someone who would move the needle but not unsurprisingly, the long shots didn't pan out.  He still has a solid core of young talent to work with.  Now he has plenty of minutes to train his team of the future.  There is talent still out there.  Mitch may surprise us with a trade that we didn't see coming.  There is a saying:  In Mitch We Trust.  Because the Lakers are the Lakers.  The Lakers always find a way."

lakers,3by8m1,A_Bridge_to_Nowhere,8,Fri Jul 3 05:02:04 2015 UTC,I really trust him but it's diminishing seeing all these free agents pass by.
lakers,3by8m1,TheAsianMamba,6,Fri Jul 3 03:38:38 2015 UTC,No other way to put it. I wonder what shit is going to come out his mouth next time he addresses the media
lakers,3by8m1,duragjones,8,Fri Jul 3 03:43:01 2015 UTC,That's what so intriguing. He's such a smart guy he's got to understand that he has no chance at spinning this into anything other than disaster.
lakers,3by8m1,duragjones,0,Fri Jul 3 03:47:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly I will be so disappointed to hear we never even offered Harris the max, cmon Mitchy don't fuck this up!!!"
lakers,3by8m1,dalas3322,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:55:45 2015 UTC,i'd like to hear why we didn't get ed signed back with us.
lakers,3bzams,p321p,9,Fri Jul 3 10:43:05 2015 UTC,"Most Lakers fans are hung up with FA because this offseason is a key one. There are some important points to consider:   Locking up a star player for the current max, will be helpful to cap when cap increases next year Getting a key FA establishes our organization, and makes us more appealing to more players come next offseason (again increase of cap allows for possible gathering of big superstars) Brings a leader/primary option to replace Kobe when he leaves, and guide the young roster   Building through rookies is never a full guarantee. If we don't get a FA this offseason, it's not looking better the next offseason. We have 23 million in cap - yet we can't get anyone. This tarnishes our franchise's reputation and makes us an unattractive destination. Remember, the cap increasing just means that all players get a raise. It doesn't mean a team can start signing multiple superstars. The only possible way this happens is if we sign someone THIS year under the current CBA, and then add another guy next year. But at this point, it looks like no one wants to come, which hurts our future tremendously."
lakers,3bzams,ss3happy1,3,Fri Jul 3 12:22:17 2015 UTC,"Most Lakers fans are hung up with FA because this offseason is a key one.   Right.  Add in that the last couple years that has been the mantra coming from the Laker Front office:  We need Cap Space for ""flexibility"".  That is why last season, we traded for guys on expiring contracts (Boozier, Lin) and gave out 1 year deals to players like Hill.  The Plan was Cap Space and FAs.  The fact they can't sign any is disturbing."
lakers,3bzams,ControlAgent13,5,Fri Jul 3 14:36:50 2015 UTC,"It isn't necessarily about having these top free agents for this upcoming season, it's about having something to show next summer's free agents that we have something worth building on. If we don't end up signing anyone notable, what's going to make KD (who will be even pickier about picking teams than Aldridge) come? Zero chance."
lakers,3bzams,c_double_u,2,Fri Jul 3 11:37:01 2015 UTC,"if we signed someone like DJ it would just help our core grow, he is perfect fit with Randle and our team also would help us with future FAs."
lakers,3bzams,rejectx,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:48:59 2015 UTC,Yeah DJ could be a good piece around Randle and the team in general. He brings in the presence in the paint. Also has been having a good health record despite logging in good minutes and starting the past 2 seasons.
lakers,3bzams,justsomeguy5,2,Fri Jul 3 10:56:07 2015 UTC,"The problem is that there's very little to build on. Clarkson was alright last season. No one has a clue how Randle will play in the NBA, or these new guys they just drafted. This is a team full of question marks, and the Lakers entered this offseason with tons of money to spend, and have nothing to show for it. The fans have a right to be upset. They spend money to come to the games, but look at the product on the floor.  Terrible."
lakers,3bzams,chaseeast,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:08:23 2015 UTC,Yeah we need to develop are youngins. Lakers havent really made a big free agent signing in a good while. We usually find steals by doing trades
lakers,3bzams,likwidsage,0,Fri Jul 3 11:02:31 2015 UTC,"I really only want a center. LA would be nice, but also feel it would take some shine away from Randles growth."

When we were on, we were fucking on. We beat them in the playoffs more times than they've beaten us, that alone is a win for me."
lakers,3bxht1,Wateriswet1212,2,Thu Jul 2 23:53:58 2015 UTC,I'd rather be the Lakers and win titles sporadically than be the Spurs and lose in the conference finals consistently.
lakers,3bxht1,zzyyxxqq,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah we will be back but it will take time. people think its easy to rebuild and get delusional with dreams of Durant, Westbrook and whoever else playing for us which is not going to happen. We will have to have a core team in the 40 win range to even think of getting star free agents to sign here.   It took us 6 years from 2002 to 2008 to get to the finals again and we had an all time great on our roster. It will take more than that this time"

lakers,3bxht1,readem_n_weep,2,Fri Jul 3 02:17:39 2015 UTC,no. jerry west was the one to build the 3 peat Lakers. Jerry West got the Lakers Kobe and Shaq. some other marquee mitch moves- trading caron butler for kwame brown. signing smush parker. trading lamar odom for nobody. letting pau and dwight walk instead of trading them (clippers were offering bledsoe+ blake for dwight) while celtics were offering rondo for pau in 2012.
lakers,3bxht1,LakeshowAA24,2,Fri Jul 3 02:47:53 2015 UTC,"You're skipping the part where he brought in Pau and company to win two more championships though. The ""almost"" three peat team was very different from the early 2000 three peat team."

I meant in theory of course, what if Upshaw pans out becomes that defensive presence they need becoming Ben Wallace 2.0, Russell wins ROY and tears up the league averaging 21 ppg, Nance becomes Lamar odom 2.0 and averages 13/8, Anthony Brown becomes a light version of Jimmy butler and averages 15 ppg, Clarkson steps up his game and replaces kobe at the SG (Kobe reinjures his knee) averaging 18 ppg with 8 apg, Randle becomes an All star caliber player (second team) averaging 22 ppg as him and Russell develop the best P&R in the league. The lakers manage to not only make the playoffs but make it as the 7th seed, and then do the improvable knocking out the 2nd seeded LA clippers in a showdown that starts the next great rivalry in LA sports. Then I wake up of course."
lakers,3c18xs,Itorr475,5,Fri Jul 3 20:58:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand how hard it is to average double digits in the league. You can't just throw out random players, add on a ""2.0"", and theorize these types of situations. Boogie barely made it to the all-star team for goodness sake.  Also, we're in the WEST. We're not making the playoffs. No wonder you got shit on.  Horrible post."
lakers,3c18xs,rheeddiddi,-5,Fri Jul 3 21:08:38 2015 UTC,"In theory, wow its the offseason for christs sake, how stupid would you feel if the lakers did make the playoffs? Its not that insane, IF was the key word there, Im willing to take a bet with anyone that the lakers 1. Make the playoffs and 2. win more than 45 games."
lakers,3c18xs,rheeddiddi,2,Fri Jul 3 21:20:01 2015 UTC,"Bruh your delusional if you think this squad as currently constructed is going to the playoffs in the west. I'm huge Kobe fan but the man is 36 and coming off consecutive injuries he isnt gunna average 30pts to carry a rookie filled team to the western playoffs. Unless LA signs up to save us, and the fuck would he, we arent sniffing the playoffs."
lakers,3c18xs,rheeddiddi,-2,Fri Jul 3 21:28:05 2015 UTC,"Are we taking into account the other NBA team moves? Playoff teams with recent changes and major blows.  Dallas- Lost their leading scorer Ellis to FA, signed broken down Matthews and non offense having DJ  Portland- Lost some key players, Batum, Matthews, Afflalo, and more than likely LA  Clippers- Lost their best defensive player and P&R guy DJ, got an old paul pierce  San Antonio- most of team remained in tact but key players are a year older, Duncan, Ginobilli, lost splitter, at some point they will have to go down hill.  Pelicans-Made the playoffs on the last game of the year, pretty good squad but not a powerhouse and not guaranteed to make the playoffs.  Rockets- Team is still in tact, expect them to make the playoffs next year.  Warriors- will be the warriors  So everyone is already crowning the playoff teams that have had a lot of turnover this offseason?"
lakers,3c18xs,rheeddiddi,2,Fri Jul 3 21:35:05 2015 UTC,Portland drops from the playoffs probably but a healthy okc fills in for them the kings if they get a focused rondo will be better as well. If our rookies ball out and kobe plays well i could see us being 10th in the west
lakers,3c18xs,dredhedjizzle27,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"You can't be serious... So let me assume that youre theorizing the Lakers to make the 7-8 seed, you're telling me that you are willing to bet that a team with an aging Kobe and a bunch of rookies and sophomore are going to replace the warriors, rockets, clippers, blazers, grizzlies, spurs, mavericks, and pelicans? The only team that will probably get booted from playoff contention are the blazers but they are quickly replaced by a healthy okc team.  So tell me, how does a starting five of russell, clarkson, kobe, randle, and black beat any of those teams? They can't even beat the Kings at this point (who are looking to have a team of rondo, collison, belinelli, gay, and cousins).  Go root for the clippers, you are clearly delusional and know nothing of basketball."

lakers,3bxgd0,Ibrahimnaldo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:40:05 2015 UTC,I think the mavs are another interesting choice.  He can take over for Dirk playing a similar role. With him on the team they would have a chance at grabbing someone else next year and making a run......kinda like the lakers.

lakers,3bxgd0,khkarma,3,Fri Jul 3 06:33:09 2015 UTC,"yea damage control for the Lakers. It's not an utter waste of time for Aldridge. Who doesn't like to be wooed? He loses nothing by taking the meeting, gets free dinner and strokes his ego."
lakers,3bxgd0,RolloJTomasi,9,Fri Jul 3 06:41:14 2015 UTC,He's not coming to LA. Spurs seems like the best candidate. Time to move on.
lakers,3bxgd0,tehjavi,35,Thu Jul 2 23:22:22 2015 UTC,"It's been 24 hours since Free Agency began and the highest sought after FA has given only one team a second meeting. You go to the meeting and you make your case. When did we get a bunch of silly children in this sub? So afraid of failure that they quit in the middle of the game?  The Lakers are making the extra effort and even if it doesn't work out, that's the professional move. If it lands them Aldridge all these Sour Grapes Kids will be the first ones to go out and buy LMA jerseys.  If it doesn't work out, you still know you did everything you could do to secure the guy. None of the other free agents matter. They're not franchise players. You can always find role players. You may as well invest Two Days on trying to lock down the franchise guy. Especially if he grants you a second meeting.  Pfft, ITT kids calling for ""move on"" mid afternoon on 7/2/15 before the meeting has even ended. Stop fearing failure.   Edit: don't let your dreams be dreams."
lakers,3bxgd0,amarstan,10,Fri Jul 3 00:39:40 2015 UTC,"People don't realize he met with the Lakers first after the worst season in franchise history, and giving a SECOND look.  That in itself is huge."

lakers,3bxgd0,TheWizard77,-4,Fri Jul 3 00:55:41 2015 UTC,"Calm down man, I'm just being pointing out the truth. It would be great if LMA came to the Lakers but why would a guy who's getting similar max offers from other teams come to a team that is in full rebuild mode? If you were LMA and want to win which team seems more enticing? No one is giving up but we put so much emphasis on LMA that we didn't put too much effort into other free agents that would have been great addition to the Laker roster. Sure they may not be franchise players but where are those role players you're talking about? Yea we got the rooks but it's always good to have more veteran presence on the team for them to learn from. I'll never give up on the Lakers but I will at least admit the obvious  facts when I see them."

lakers,3bxgd0,supermaor23,2,Thu Jul 2 23:26:43 2015 UTC,We basically begged him. I don't think he's seriously considering us at this point but the meeting might push us into the serious contender list. I just want him to fucking decide soon.

lakers,3bxgd0,likwidsage,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:01:19 2015 UTC,"Damage control is just stupid.  The guy's not gonna waste his time on a team he has no intention on signing with, just like he didn't with NY.  That being said, that doesn't mean he will sign with us or that we're the front runner."
lakers,3bxgd0,ChoGanji,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:10:33 2015 UTC,Its probably more along the line of instead of wasting time he would by talking with the knicks hes using it for damage control with us. or for his agent?
lakers,3bxgd0,megavino,4,Fri Jul 3 00:39:22 2015 UTC,"No, you guys are taking this reddit narrative and running with it. Players don't do damage control for teams. Let alone for teams they have no intentions in dealing with."
lakers,3bxgd0,shilldabeast,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:56:06 2015 UTC,"Its so stupid if it is because if he signs with the spurs or someone else, it makes it obvious that it was damage control and we look even worse because we basically confirmed that our first meeting was a shitshow. I don't mind missing on free agents, but I don't feel like have a plan. If the FO plan is ""we're the lakers and someone will bite"", that doesn't fly anymore. If we waste time with these guys and a tobias harris is off the market after deandre and aldrige sign with someone else, we fucked up big time. Hopefully I'm wrong and Mitch has a plan."
lakers,3bxgd0,megavino,2,Fri Jul 3 00:46:50 2015 UTC,"How do you know the second meeting is for damage control? If you were a highly sought out free-agent would you waste your time in taking a second meeting with a team that didn't even impress you? That makes absolutely no sense and would be a waste of time. Clearly there is something he is interested in for Aldridge to agree to a second meeting. Does that mean he will sign? No, but getting a second meeting when no one else has received one says something."
lakers,3bxgd0,BionicSix,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"The meeting was only 90 minutes. The reason he would waste his time with a second meeting was because the lakers felt it was embarrassing that the agency who represents lamarcus basically called them out on their shit after they had leaked the meeting went well. Because said agency will undoubtedly do business with the lakers again, they want to maintain a good relationship with the lakers and scheduled another meeting. That's why the meeting probably went 90 minutes. I want to believe that Aldridge was genuinely interested and I'll be happy to be proven wrong but I don't think it's anything more then that."
lakers,3bxgd0,suitntiekid18,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:23:09 2015 UTC,"Damage control.  There were a lot of powerful media people in that meeting who have brand relationships across several mediums and for the LMA camp to basically say, ""eh, y u no bball plan?"" and instead of saying ""No"", letting it leak out that he wasn't impressed was a slap in the face and embarrassing."
lakers,3bxgd0,iNteL-_-,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:08:25 2015 UTC,"I think he's considering, he met with LA first and are the only team to get a second meeting, at this point all we have is hope, so I'll take it"

I already know he's solid defensively but I know for sure he's not better than Deandre.  Nevermind. I misread the age part, Biyombo doesn't have the low post defense or rebounding of DJ at his age, but he is certainly excellent at protecting the rim."

The man does not know how to pass, crazy low pass-rate even for a center. He has cinder blocks for hands and does not know how to position himself on offense. He'll be strictly catching lobs on offense. Overall, his superb shot-blocking ability gives him playtime in this league, but his offense is so shite that teams can't afford to start him. Also I heard rumors he lied about his age so he might not have the upside people believe in.  TLDR: yes he's similar to Ed Davis but he's a better defender, with absolutely horrible offensive game, at least Ed provides PnR finishing."

lakers,3bwxy1,rejectx,14,Thu Jul 2 20:51:36 2015 UTC,well no one expected everyone to sign in first day
lakers,3bwxy1,NicDwolfwood,3,Thu Jul 2 20:54:58 2015 UTC,That's true there are a lot of restricted free agents than anything else.
lakers,3bwxy1,NeMANja_the_Matic,5,Thu Jul 2 20:55:55 2015 UTC,"Free agency has moved damn fast this year. its barely day 2 and pretty much all the major free agents have already agreed to terms on a new contracts.   Plus it seems they didnt really learn shit. if their pitch to Aldridge focused on off court opportunities, more than on court, then that is a fucking problem, and indicative of why the franchise is fucked. with the internet/social media, you no longer have to be in big markets to get other business opportunities and exposure. and the Lakers no longer have the money advantage either, because small markets can offer huge contracts just as well as big markets can."
lakers,3bwxy1,Musingmike,4,Thu Jul 2 22:36:38 2015 UTC,I want Robin Lopez. A lot.
lakers,3bwxy1,NeMANja_the_Matic,3,Thu Jul 2 21:51:53 2015 UTC,Bummer because he is about to sign with the Knicks.
lakers,3bwxy1,mes8007,2,Fri Jul 3 00:50:08 2015 UTC,"Damn! I thought he would be a great fit for us. He is highly under-rated. I really only watch Laker games and then whenever there are good match-ups on TNT or ESPN, but Robin was on my fantasy team last year and he was awesome for me before he got hurt."
lakers,3bwxy1,pistolpete4407,7,Fri Jul 3 01:28:51 2015 UTC,Tobias is sitting there just begging for a signing sheet... Smh .. Tbh I prefer Tobias.. Young and his prime will match our young guys prime. Unlike LMA.

lakers,3bwxy1,tangential_quip,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:41:01 2015 UTC,I believe they said they won't.
lakers,3bwxy1,Musingmike,3,Thu Jul 2 23:48:31 2015 UTC,That was when they still had a max offer our to Millsap.  The situation changed when he re-signed with Atlanta.
lakers,3bwxy1,TimeisIllmatic95,3,Thu Jul 2 23:51:33 2015 UTC,No. They are just striking out on everybody.
lakers,3bwxy1,DJyoungHeisenberg,2,Fri Jul 3 00:49:46 2015 UTC,"Both last year's free agency and this year's is overrated IMO. People too worried about us trying to sign players just because other teams are. IDK about you guys, but I don't wanna be a mediocre team in the West."

lakers,3bwxy1,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:55:19 2015 UTC,We need to start making an offer that they can't refuse ;)
lakers,3bwxy1,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:44:21 2015 UTC,"Who else were we going to get if we didn't sign Melo?  Luol Deng? Lance Stephenson?  Chandler Parsons? Really?  We're going to cry over missing those guys?  It's not like we missed out on Lebron or Bosh because of Carmelo.  I mean Eric Bledsoe was still available after Carmelo stayed with the Knicks.  They could've put in an offer for him, and they chose not to."
lakers,3bwxy1,FreshDiamond,5,Thu Jul 2 21:00:34 2015 UTC,TBH I didnt really mind the fact that we didnt get many free agents last year. I was all aboard the tank train. This year is different though. It would be a plus if we get good players on decent contracts with the cap going up. They look good to future free agents if you have some kind of structure in your roster. Are we really going to tank with a top 3 protected? Thats risky as fuck
lakers,3bvo47,Buckelroo,34,Thu Jul 2 15:06:25 2015 UTC,You have 3 20 year old guys with a lot of potential  They need to show it on the court before fa's will consider us
lakers,3bvo47,Theingloriousak2,5,Thu Jul 2 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"This.    It's not an utter failure by the front office; it's that coming and playing with a bunch of unknown rooks isn't all that attractive.  If Clarkson/Russell/Randle all show off as an exciting trio next year, an Aldridge-type will be more interested next summer.   I mean, to me, that trio is just as exciting as the Bucks' young team, but Monroe went with the more known players.  Give it patience."
lakers,3bvo47,firestulantz,2,Thu Jul 2 16:22:21 2015 UTC,but is byron scott and his staff capable of developing russell and randle?
lakers,3bvo47,hanni90,5,Thu Jul 2 17:04:24 2015 UTC,Scott has had great young PG's before. CP3 and Irving plus Clarkson was looking well towards the end of last season. Whether you want to give him credit for those or not since it's most likely a toss up if he really did much for those guys.
lakers,3bvo47,Omnipotent420,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:16:02 2015 UTC,"He was more than capable in developing Clarkson.    In fact, I'm more stoked for Randle this year than I was last summer because of JC's rapid development.  (If JC can get there in a season, Randle can too.)  You can claim it was just JC's extra minutes, but you can't just totally ignore coaching because you want to be dismissive."
lakers,3bvo47,firestulantz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:47:37 2015 UTC,"Byron Scott has had some pretty good success with good point guards.  He took the 2003 Nets to the finals with Jason Kidd in his prime.  He coached Kyrie Irving 2011 when Kyrie got rookie of the year.  Granted, Russell may or may not be on the same level as Kidd and Irving, but Byron Scott is more than qualified to coach him."
lakers,3bvo47,fresh_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:17:35 2015 UTC,"It works the other way as well.   You have 2 or 3 guys in FA with a body of work that proves that they are not franchise players.   Sure these FA's might be solid/integral pieces to your team, but these FA's alone are not winning you games.   Thus far in their respective careers they have not shown that or proven that."
lakers,3bvo47,SevTheNiceGuy,8,Thu Jul 2 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"I don't get most of these replies.  This guy was a great fit(young, talented big man) and well worth the max considering his was around 16 mil.  We missed out on this one especially when you look at whats left.  I'd shift the focus to Harris and just hope we can resign Davis or Hill."
lakers,3bvo47,Trontaun79,5,Thu Jul 2 15:54:31 2015 UTC,Harris is an RFA and the Magic just lost out on Millisap.
lakers,3bvo47,mcorcoran3,0,Thu Jul 2 16:52:05 2015 UTC,IKR. The man will be locked up for 3 years under a current CBA max with less than 7 years of exp. Signing him would be a steal for any team.
lakers,3bvo47,ss3happy1,-3,Thu Jul 2 17:01:44 2015 UTC,"Horrible defender. Above average scorer at his size. Doesn't add up to a max. Especially when it's clear his agenda is get paid now, and hit FA when the cap skyrockets. No thanks."
lakers,3bvo47,mccruthers,5,Thu Jul 2 16:27:14 2015 UTC,This is just so depressing watching our team whiff of free agents after free agents.....  :(
lakers,3bvo47,clippjoint,7,Thu Jul 2 16:42:52 2015 UTC,Not a big loss for us. Especially if he wanted a max.
lakers,3bvo47,aveydey,5,Thu Jul 2 15:16:05 2015 UTC,"Ramona just tweeted that the Lakers DID offer him the max and we still got rejected. Ugh, that's depressing."

lakers,3bvo47,Bcanas,2,Thu Jul 2 15:33:17 2015 UTC,"Not only that but he does not protect the rim or play defense in any way, shape, or form, and we're already the most terrible defense in the league."
lakers,3bvo47,PaulKr,2,Thu Jul 2 15:45:57 2015 UTC,Also who would've thunk that BOTH the Lakers and the Knicks would be striking out this badly in Free Agency.
lakers,3bvo47,p0se1d0n,2,Thu Jul 2 16:04:33 2015 UTC,"We're both terrible teams, players want to win now, so it wasn't that hard to believe this would happen."

lakers,3bvo47,DouglassFunny,0,Thu Jul 2 23:18:56 2015 UTC,"Oh please. He was never going to LA. If the lakers were wasting time on him last season, it was their own stupidity and arrogance."

lakers,3bvo47,metrofeed,6,Thu Jul 2 16:36:21 2015 UTC,Holy shit I never thought I'd see the day someone rejects our max contract and signs with the motherfucking Bucks. Truly depressing.
lakers,3bvo47,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:30:31 2015 UTC,How is it that surprising that a young guy soon to enter his prime would rather play for a playoff team over a lottery bound team?

lakers,3bvo47,fresh_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:35:44 2015 UTC,Lopez or Harris otherwise we completely strike out.
lakers,3bvo47,mylefthandkilledme,3,Thu Jul 2 15:11:51 2015 UTC,"I'm okay with Harris so long as we only offer 9-10 million.  Anything more than that, let the Celtics or Magic have him.  I'm more than content with standing pat this offseason or taking bad contracts for 1st rounders."
lakers,3bvo47,StealthRUs,0,Thu Jul 2 15:22:02 2015 UTC,"That's a terrible idea. Who the hell wants to team up with some rookies? Next year the same shit will happen all over again. We need quality players right now, to attract stars later. Jesus Christ some of you guys still haven't learned after this terrible free agency?"
lakers,3bvo47,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:32:33 2015 UTC,"You're the one who hasn't learned.  We don't have a star talent base.  We're trying to be the destination for guys like Kevin Love and Lamarcus Aldridge, not guys like Demarre Carroll and Greg Monroe.  We don't have any stars on this team, so all we can do is clear the decks and have the cap room to sign multiple star guys.  Having the Greg Monroes of the world on our payroll interferes with that."
lakers,3bvo47,StealthRUs,2,Thu Jul 2 18:57:54 2015 UTC,You can't get the LMA's and Kevin Love's with no team though.
lakers,3bvo47,DouglassFunny,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:04:15 2015 UTC,"This is the combo we should've signed in the first place. Those two fill gaping holes in our roster. They're both pretty young too, but both have more experience than most of our roster. which is definitely a positive.   We should've avoided the PR nightmare that came with courting a big name, and just signed two solid players. Clarkson/Russell/Randle/Nance/Upshaw/Lopez/Harris is a really nice looking young core, and we'd still have space for two max slots next year.   I feel like the FO is trying to get the star first, then the supporting cast. No star wants to sign with a team with no players."
lakers,3bvo47,DouglassFunny,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:03:06 2015 UTC,We can get both. If only Kupchak gave up and actually focused on these two free agents.
lakers,3bvo47,TheAsianMamba,0,Thu Jul 2 15:19:47 2015 UTC,"Lakers have enough cap space for both and Ed Davis and likely Jeremy Lin(the backup PG they're going to need). They're sitting on this hands again just like last year while waiting for Carmelo to take a sabbatical and decide where he wants to go while all the other decent/borderline good free agents sign deals with other teams. Like I said, we're lottery bound again because the Lakers front office simply doesn't learn."
lakers,3bvo47,justsomeguy5,3,Thu Jul 2 15:22:10 2015 UTC,So you think throwing a max at Harris is how we're going to win a championship? I'd rather wait for a great player to throw a max at than just giving one just to be mediocre. I'd rather win a few championships every decade and be bad for a few years than be average all the time.
lakers,3bvo47,TuneHD,9,Thu Jul 2 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"Your first sentence is why the Lakers aren't any closer to being back in the hunt. It's not about winning a championship. We're not winning one this season, or next season. The Lakers need to rebuild the core of the team. 15 million may be a bit of an overpay, but the Lakers don't have anyone else, and aren't going to get anyone else either. Here are the options the Lakers:  Sign no one because we shouldn't be ""mediocre"", and have a repeat of the last 2 seasons.  OR  Sign someone, and work on rebuilding the Lakers as a winning team that will be a contender again some day so that free agents take the Lakers seriously. You learned nothing from Dwight, Carmelo, Chris Bosh, and Lamarcus Aldridge all telling the Lakers that they aren't in a position to win now. No one wants to play with a bunch of rookies and if the Lakers don't get it in gear, that's all that we'll have on the roster."
lakers,3bvo47,justsomeguy5,2,Thu Jul 2 15:43:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly, so what's the rush? Wait until we can find the proper pieces for a championship instead of just rushing to become first round exits.  Melo and Bosh went back to their teams, LA is going to a team contending right now since he's 30, and Dwight left after Kobe went down since he's getting old too. What does that have to do with anything? We have 3 guys who are our core with 2 being unproven, have some faith. We have the #7 and #2 pick playing next season."
lakers,3bvo47,TuneHD,3,Thu Jul 2 16:15:59 2015 UTC,"You learned nothing from Dwight, Carmelo, Chris Bosh,   I'll add to that, that the reason we didn't get Carmelo or Bosh was that we were restricted by the CBA from paying them as much as the Heat and Knicks could.  If it really was about ""winning now"", Bosh would've gone to the Rockets and built a juggernaut and Carmelo would've gone to the Bulls.  Those dudes wanted to get paid, and they liked the teams they were with."
lakers,3bvo47,StealthRUs,5,Thu Jul 2 16:28:25 2015 UTC,"It's not about winning a championship.   It absolutely is.  It's always about winning a championship.  We are the fucking Lakers.  If being horrible for 4 straight years lets us spend the next 5 years in contention and winning 2-3 titles, so be it.  I could give a fuck less about 8th seeds and being competitive.  It's contention or bust.     Sign no one because we shouldn't be ""mediocre"", and have a repeat of the last 2 seasons.   The last 2 seasons that possible have landed us 2 potential franchise-changing talents.     You learned nothing from Dwight, Carmelo, Chris Bosh, and Lamarcus Aldridge all telling the Lakers that they aren't in a position to win now.   And Greg Monroe, Robin Lopez, Rajon Rondo, Brandon Jennings, Demarre Carroll, and all the other B-list and C-list players that everyone here is clamoring for don't put us in a position to win now, either."
lakers,3bvo47,StealthRUs,2,Thu Jul 2 16:24:12 2015 UTC,"Those players you mentioned aren't supposed to make us win now, they're supposed to help lure other free agents, what the hell will you tell KD or Westbrook? ""Come team up with some inexperienced 20 year olds and waste some years of your prime!"" Jesus you still haven't learned after every player has turned us down because they to win right fucking now. This isn't NBA2k where Randle and Russell become fucking all stars, then you offer KD a contract and he immediately accepts. And stop with the ""We're the fucking Lakers"" bullshit, look where that stupid pride and living in the past bullshit has gotten us. We need to build smart and not like it's a video game where we just tank and build a dynasty."
lakers,3bvo47,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:42:07 2015 UTC,"But they're supposed to say, ""Oh yeah, they've got Robin Lopez!  Let me go there!""  We don't have a talent base right now, so all we can do is keep the decks clear to sign multiple top-tier guys.  Lebron and Chris Bosh didn't care that the Heat only had Mario Chalmers under contract when they went to play with Dwayne Wade.    The filled in the role players after the stars were already signed.  Stars first, complimentary players second."
lakers,3bvo47,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:54:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah because I'm sure they're dying to team up with Julius Randle lol. RoLo is starter-quality center and signing guys like Tobias Harris should improve our record while keeping our core young. Do you really think KD or any other big name is going to sign with us after we tank another year? We'll miss out on all the stars of 2016 then 2017 rolls around and all we have are inexperienced youngins, who the fuck is leaving their team to come join us. I don't know about you but I prefer getting proven talent over rookies who can become busts or just not great players. Good luck getting stars first with this shitty roster."
lakers,3bvo47,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:05:14 2015 UTC,"RoLo is as mediocre a center as it gets.  Tobias Harris could be a good signing, because he's 22, but that's about it.  Improving our record does nothing at this point but hurt us.  We need to keep tanking.     Do you really think KD or any other big name is going to sign with us after we tank another year?    If we have the money to pair him with other A-list guys, absolutely.  And even if those guys aren't out there, after playing the young guys, if they show value, we can use them as trade bait along with our pick to acquire another A-list guy to pair KD with.   The Kings didn't want to trade DMC for Randle, Clarkson and our pick this year, but if Randle and Clarkson show real promise next year they'll probably be a lot more willing to trade him to us for those guys plus a first rounder this time next year."
lakers,3bvo47,StealthRUs,2,Thu Jul 2 19:13:17 2015 UTC,Well said my friend. Have an upvote.
lakers,3bvo47,supremesamurai,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:39:00 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is that we are guaranteed NOTHING in the future. Tanking doesn't guarantee we're going to draft a superstar. Leaving open cap room does not mean we're going to sign a superstar. You have to build some kind of foundation, unless you want to rely on luck."

lakers,3bvo47,supremesamurai,0,Thu Jul 2 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"Monroe's decision tells me that he wants the rewards without the risk.   He is going to a team where there is no pressure for him to win or for him to prove that he is the top guy.   it's a smart move on his part.   There would have been too much pressure in LA or NY for him to show/prove that he was a top guy in those big markets.   LMA is trying to accomplish the same thing. LMA will go to the spurs and get to hide behind Duncan, Leonard, and Parker when it comes to production and taking the team to the next level. LMA tried it in Portland for 9 years and he failed."

lakers,3budmw,Lyqu1d,2,Thu Jul 2 13:02:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I am happier in the position we are in now than if we signed Shumpert and Monroe to the deals that they got."
lakers,3budmw,NeMANja_the_Matic,22,Thu Jul 2 21:49:44 2015 UTC,So excited for our core moving forward.
lakers,3budmw,SantaMariaD17,5,Thu Jul 2 06:17:35 2015 UTC,"We got our 1, 2 punch in Russell, Randle. Give it a few years when they start tearing shit up. FA's will be mad that they didnt sign with us when they got the chance."
lakers,3budmw,diondrems,3,Thu Jul 2 13:21:30 2015 UTC,Thing is LA is just turning 30 right now. In a few years he'll be 33? He's an old man.
lakers,3budmw,Cienes,10,Thu Jul 2 15:40:40 2015 UTC,"As unpopular as it may sound I'm ok with no big free agents this year. Put our young guys on the court let them take their lumps, possibly play us into contention for a top-3 pick that we can keep for even more young talent. The west is so strong right now and a mediocre product is all we can really expect even if we sign one big name so why not wait a little longer and rebuild the right way?"
lakers,3budmw,MaxwellSlice,3,Thu Jul 2 10:40:40 2015 UTC,"Only thing I honestly really wanted a veteran at center like Chandler with us playing a lot of Angelo, Clarkson, A Brown, and Randle to really let them develop. I can see those 4 turning into a rookie CP3, Mike Conley, Ariza, and quicker Z-bo with better ball handling. Nance could be our Aaron Gordon."
lakers,3budmw,TuneHD,2,Thu Jul 2 12:08:27 2015 UTC,"Come on man, I thought we all already agreed that Gordon sucks."
lakers,3budmw,Lyqu1d,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:00:57 2015 UTC,"He's a good athletic defensive player, he just needs to try to model his game after a guy like Ibaka or Noel."
lakers,3budmw,TuneHD,2,Thu Jul 2 13:26:14 2015 UTC,Nance has great touch. I watched a lot of his college games.
lakers,3budmw,Riles26,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:22:37 2015 UTC,Only problem is we won't have a first round pick next year
lakers,3budmw,zon3d0ut,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:53:19 2015 UTC,We do if it falls in the #1-3 range I'm pretty sure.
lakers,3budmw,MaxwellSlice,24,Thu Jul 2 16:15:18 2015 UTC,"Screw deandre Jordan, we have a potential defensive phenom in Robert upshaw if he gets his act together.  Screw LA, we have a potential all star in Randle if he can find his jumpshot.  Screw anybody's else's backcourt because we can have  potentially the most dangerous back court in the league.   Loaded with potential up the wazoo."
lakers,3budmw,Aliensdoexist,9,Thu Jul 2 07:03:55 2015 UTC,Dloading...
lakers,3budmw,FuriousFlex,13,Thu Jul 2 08:56:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah at this point, just give the youngsters major minutes and have Kobe's farewell tour."
lakers,3budmw,riceballa,3,Thu Jul 2 05:56:00 2015 UTC,The fact that we kept our pick and moved up to #2 is enough. Any FAs we add (hopefully a solid starter or rotation guy) would be gravy.

lakers,3budmw,Lyqu1d,3,Thu Jul 2 13:03:07 2015 UTC,Seriously.    I've been watching Randle and D'Lo highlights all day today and im fucking excited.  Today did suck tho.
lakers,3budmw,revolver066,2,Thu Jul 2 09:10:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for cheering me up. I guess we have to rebuild the new way. Should be worth it :)

lakers,3budmw,p0se1d0n,-1,Thu Jul 2 14:36:21 2015 UTC,Kobe's Farewell Tour....  Never thought those 3 words would bring such a huge smile to my face.
lakers,3budmw,SpaceboyOfMischief,0,Thu Jul 2 06:07:46 2015 UTC,"But, if the front office remains incompetent and the Lakers brand continues to decline and we are unable to sign any star talent in the next couple years, I'm afraid our young studs will just take themselves away from us and go to a team that has their shit together. I really really really hope that won't happen. Please tell me that won't happen."
lakers,3budmw,Thidwicks_Ultimatum,7,Thu Jul 2 06:41:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly even if everything were to go wrong, it's so hard for players to get away from their teams nowadays, you don't have to worry about it. Hopefully that's not an issue and things begin to turn around soon."
lakers,3budmw,supremesamurai,2,Thu Jul 2 06:42:42 2015 UTC,"That ""incompetent"" front office was competent enough to hit homeruns in two consecutive drafts... dont buy into the hype that they dont know what theyre doing just because they didnt sign a top tier free agent those two years. We can build through youth, were just not used to taking this approach."

lakers,3c05m4,IDontRegreddit,2,Fri Jul 3 15:54:34 2015 UTC,I'm a lakers fan and I think it is unreasonable. The lakers have had  success that isn't likely to happen anymore in the new era of  basketball. I would say making the playoffs in the next 3 years will be a solid accomplishment. If the lakers can't make the playoffs in the next 3 years then that is a problem. The fans idea of only winning championships is unrealistic and will cause the organization to make bad decisions like they have been.
lakers,3c05m4,sillymath22,2,Fri Jul 3 18:03:02 2015 UTC,"My goals:  2016: 30 wins.  2017: participating in the West's annual blood-bath battle for the 8 seed.  2018: playoffs.   Those are obtainable goals most definitely, and that's how I would know our rebuild is going the right way.   D'Angelo Russell will also only be 22 after the 2018 season, keep that in mind. Randle will be 23. Both guys (if they live up to their expectations) will still be a handful of years away from entering their primes as well.   I know they aren't as flashy as some goals of other Lakers fans, but they're most certainly obtainable."
lakers,3c05m4,badguymatt,2,Fri Jul 3 20:14:29 2015 UTC,Dude we have only been bad for about 2 years and when kobe is off the books literally we will have STACKS of cash to throw at people with our rookies still being on rookie contracts and the cap going up 3 years seems like a stretch if Kobe retires this year
lakers,3c05m4,KennyPOV,2,Fri Jul 3 16:21:06 2015 UTC,It's not going to be that easy. Like 27 teams are going to have space to sign FAs next season. Why would they come to the Lakers if there are playoff team trying to sign them?
lakers,3c05m4,high5ghost,2,Fri Jul 3 16:28:22 2015 UTC,Because we will have the money to sign other assets to pair them with. Take this year for example yea we could get LMA and a decent bigman to pair with him not to enticing with our young supporting cast in which 2 of the most attractive assets have played a combined 14 min in the NBA. If we have those 2 (Russle and Randle) play well and clarkson play well it looks better. Then with Kobe off the books we could sign Someone like LMA with the promise of bringing in 2-3 good players to pair with. This in turn = depth. I am not saying it will be that easy but when you have alot of cap space open depending how much we spend this year. This is what I expect to happen you don't have to agree with me.
lakers,3c05m4,KennyPOV,-1,Fri Jul 3 16:36:17 2015 UTC,Not really. By that time our young guys (if we keep them that is) should of developed fairly well and no how to play together. We have a boat load of cap space next year to try and get some people. The Spurs will be rebuilding with their older stars almost done. Same goes for the Mavs I don't see them being as big a threat then. The rockets I think will start to tail off with Howard starting to have some issues. I think clippers will start to decline as well. The lakers should have a decent shot.
lakers,3c05m4,moserftbl88,0,Fri Jul 3 16:04:32 2015 UTC,"Spurs? They have the old big 3 of Tony, Duncan and Manu passing the torch to the new Big 3 of Kawhi, Danny Green and maybe Aldridge. The Spurs are the most well run organization in the NBA - their players are all willing to sacrifice money to win...they will be fine."
lakers,3c05m4,ss3happy1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:37:33 2015 UTC,And when Pop retires?
lakers,3c05m4,moserftbl88,0,Fri Jul 3 19:06:04 2015 UTC,"Yea maybe I'm the only one that feels this way but the Spurs new big three does not scare me one but compared to the old big three. Green is too inconsistent, Leonard is great, Aldridge would be great for them but they need someone running that offense and still need to fill their bench. Not saying they can't I just see them being middle of the road team in the west soon."
lakers,3c05m4,p0se1d0n,-2,Fri Jul 3 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"It seems like Jim and Jeanie are way over their heads when it comes to running the Lakers.   These ""apples"" fell very far away from the tree and have no business running this franchise to the ground like this.   These two incompetent and inept spoiled brats need to get their act together ASAP or look into selling the team and collecting their billions."

lakers,3bwj93,howdoesilogin,2,Thu Jul 2 20:57:11 2015 UTC,"Philly will ask for multiple picks (a first, future second, to take lee's contract)  W lakers, they'd only have to give up a single pick and a bench player they don't have room for anyway..more cap savings/less luxury tax. Morey always asks for at least two picks in these salary dump situations historically"
lakers,3bwj93,Akvc8,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:12:23 2015 UTC,"Not exactly, as it stands now they have 2 suitors at the least (us and Philly) so they'll probably take whoever gives the better offer and we seem to be preoccupied with chasing big names."

lakers,3bw31b,Lyqu1d,3,Thu Jul 2 19:50:12 2015 UTC,"no if our pick falls below 3 as in we get #4 it goes to whoever phily trade their pick to.  if we get 1, 2 , 3 we keep it until next year."

lakers,3bw31b,Lyqu1d,2,Thu Jul 2 20:02:44 2015 UTC,"if we tank and the lottery gives us 1,2,3 we keep it, else we lose it."
lakers,3bw31b,sunstersun,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:03:14 2015 UTC,"Technically you are right, anything above 3, ie 4-30 is going away. In this case however lower numbers are more desirable and in fact pick first so your usage of above, while right, is confusing to native speakers. When people think of ""high"" draft picks that are ""above"" others they think of the picks with the lowest numbers."
lakers,3bw31b,lufty574,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:07:14 2015 UTC,"What are the consequences if we tank again? What I actually meant was:  Consider #1 the highest pick and #30 the lowest pick. Does the ""3rd protected pick"" term means that if we tank again the highest pick we can be awarded with is #4? I mean, because otherwise it would pretty clever for us to tank real hard again and then land a #1, #2 or a #3 pick in L.A. again.  I'm not entirely sure that I comprehend how much of a factor the season winning % is relevant to grant a team a high tier pick. What about the lottery?"
lakers,3bw31b,Lyqu1d,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"No you have it backwards. The highest pick you can be rewarded is the #1 pick, and the lowest is the #3 pick. Anything lower than #3 gets sent to Philly.   So the consequences are that even if you finish with the worst record in the entire league, you aren't guranteed to have the #1, #2, or #3 pick. Actually, for any single pick, the highest chance is to fall to #4, with a 35% chance of happening. So it's a big risk since there is no scenario where the Lakers are guaranteed to keep their pick."
lakers,3bw31b,HeJind,2,Thu Jul 2 22:52:42 2015 UTC,"Great explanation. I'm sorry for bothering you, but one last question that's gonna solve a doubt: what's our current position for the next draft?"

lakers,3bw31b,LifelongRedditor,3,Thu Jul 2 17:36:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah for like 3 minutes, because the team that didn't win the championship would get clobbered by an NBA playoff team..."
lakers,3bw31b,s_15_n,2,Thu Jul 2 17:44:15 2015 UTC,"There is no way we are making into the playoffs this year!  On the bright side LakersNAtion, our young core is going to develop nicely and hopefully we stay healthy! Next summer if this core proves they can ball, FA players will consider signing with us. All this soft scrubs that passed on us is because they don't want to be in a rebuilding situation. They want win now team. These teams also had cap space too so made our life difficult. Once Russsel, Jc, and randle ball out of their minds watch... next summer it be a attractive roster...  Also, Lakers FO get your shit together with these presentations. Hire someone learn from mistakes.. Next summer we need to LAND A BIG TIME.. KD would be nice to replace Kobe when he retires."
lakers,3bw31b,FuriousFlex,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:39:30 2015 UTC,"The second line-up is probably the best thing for us. 1) We'd save money for the 2016 FA. 2) Hopefully some, or all, of our rookies show their potential to attract said free agents. 3) We'd win around 20 games again and probably keep our pick in next years draft lottery."
lakers,3bw31b,Buckelroo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:08:40 2015 UTC,Kobe wouldn't be happy giving up his spot in the starting lineup...
lakers,3bw31b,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:44:08 2015 UTC,I think with that lineup were giving Philly a great lottery pick. Itt'l be cool to see our young guns go for it but its gonna be a rough season
lakers,3bw31b,LeBaconator,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:08:18 2015 UTC,Problem is someone needs to eat the money cba rules.
lakers,3bw31b,FuriousFlex,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:09:40 2015 UTC,"Screw trying to take things slow or trying to ""field a competitive roster"", as if that's actually possible at this point.  Play the rookies, and play them a lot.  1) By showcasing these young guys and showing teams their actual in-game talent, we boost their trade value  2) By showcasing these young guys, potential free agents like Durant now have actual, objective evidence that these guys can actually play.  3) If they all prove to suck and bust, we now know what we have and don't waste time on guys who can't cut it.  4) This is the most important thing IMO: WE BUILD LONG-TERM CHEMISTRY.  This is one of the most important elements of any sport, and it is the one thing that you cannot buy.  Rather than go out and try to make guys fit together and put together x personality with y personality, we let all these young guys grow TOGETHER, learning eachother's strengths and weaknesses, and when they all individually develop into elite talents, they are now ready to play well as a TEAM.  For instance, say we give Clarkson and D'Angelo a ton of time this year together on the court.  D'Angelo learns where Clarkson likes to get his shots, which kinds of shots work and which don't.  Clarkson learns to play more off the ball, and learns to be more efficient with his touches.  Likewise, Russell learns when to defer to Clarkson, and when to shoot vs. pass.  Same goes with Randle: D'Angelo learns where to best get his big man the ball to score, and Randle learns where to post up on the court for his pg to get him the ball.   Literally every rebuilding team in this league (us, knicks, 76ers) is using the Thunder as a blueprint for success.  Yes, the Thunder became a great team largely for their ability to draft and develop elite talent like KD, Westbrook, Durant and Ibaka, but the reason they became so good is that all of these players grew and developed TOGETHER.  Could you imagine if Westbrook and Durant were drafted by sepearate teams, then decided to team up later in their careers?  I would guess that it woudl take a ton of growing pains for these two alpha-dog, high-volume shooters to learn to play togehter, when each should defer, etc.  But they both grew up and developed TOGETHER, and because of that they learned to play as an elite team."
lakers,3byrnp,yungJoc,8,Fri Jul 3 06:41:22 2015 UTC,"If we do take on salary dumps, give us draft picks. 2016 picks. We need them.... bad."
lakers,3byrnp,SSD65,3,Fri Jul 3 06:50:50 2015 UTC,"I'll take a Hibbert salary dump. At least it's something.   If not, I'm cool with a David Lee salary dump if we're able to pull in Kevon Looney on that deal. Not sure how likely that'd be though."

lakers,3byrnp,dood23,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:52:46 2015 UTC,Hibbert would feel like a homerun at this point.  Too bad I'm not sure his attitude can handle being on a team with rookie pains.
lakers,3byrnp,Notalent13,2,Fri Jul 3 07:03:57 2015 UTC,"He might actually like it, no massive pressure on him to improve his offensive game, low expectations for the team, fans mostly excited for even the smallest improvements. I could see him jumping at the chance to play for a rebuilding team where he isn't crucified for every single mistake."
lakers,3byrnp,toptier,2,Fri Jul 3 07:17:01 2015 UTC,"I get the strategy with collecting the picks, but we're already one of the youngest teams in the league (even with kobe) right now. A trash of rookies and sophomores won't be good in my opinion.  Just saying we're not the 76ers.  Mitch is good at getting quality ""throw in"" players though."
lakers,3byrnp,_im_on_acid_,2,Fri Jul 3 10:12:45 2015 UTC,"The Good news is the Knicks won't be able to trade for Lee because they agreed to sign Lopez and won't have enough money left to absorb his salary.    The Bad news is that Roy Hibbert is likely headed to Dallas and not a salary dump option for us.  Indiana is singing Ellis so it shouldn't be hard for them to work out a sign and trade if DeAndre doesn't go to Dallas.  The Ugly news is that a salary dump of David Lee will probably help us compete for our top 3 pick, he doesn't play any defense.  They don't have any picks to give up (1st or 2nd round) until 2019, and we'd probably have to take on Brandon Rush's salary too for them to give up Looney.  He's only making $1mil so we could stretch him, but still doesn't help us"
lakers,3byrnp,JustAGuy993,0,Fri Jul 3 14:31:25 2015 UTC,"That's plan n.. Or c, d or plan y or some shit. Get David lee and assets and tank. There is no move worth doing that would make us significantly better next season besides getting jordan or Aldridge, so as might as well tank for our top three protected."
lakers,3byrnp,SlightlyRyan,3,Fri Jul 3 06:44:45 2015 UTC,"Thing is it's top 3 protected, that is absolutely terrible. Lakers could be the worst team in the league and they'd have a 35% chance of conveying the pick.  Check the odds here  We need to at least look promising enough to give 2016 free agents hope, because the cap jumps AGAIN in 2017."
lakers,3byrnp,We_Are_Grooot,4,Fri Jul 3 06:49:03 2015 UTC,Under no circumstances do I want to tank for that reason.  You think it's bad now?  Just wait until the Lakers have the worst record in the league (I still don't think that's even possible) and they end up 4th after the lottery.  That type of shit is enough to doom the whole franchise.
lakers,3bypse,SSD65,2,Fri Jul 3 06:21:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, the guys on ESPN radio LA were talking about this yesterday. We'd get the last year of Lee's contract and Kevon and/or their 1st round pick."
lakers,3bypse,Buckelroo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:35:48 2015 UTC,damn i am down with that
lakers,3bypse,joshuacrook,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:50:08 2015 UTC,"I'd be pretty ok with this, Mitch has done a good job drafting lately, my only problem with risking a tank this year was that our pick goes to the 76'ers unless we suddenly become the Cav's and get magical top 3 picks every year. Even if the Warriors pick ends up being shit, its still a better circumstance then we are in at the moment..."
lakers,3bypse,Notalent13,2,Fri Jul 3 06:55:27 2015 UTC,"I hope we don't tank for the exact reason you mentioned. I wanted to build a foundation and the Lakers had to go after LMA. Also, the chances we get into the top 3 are very slim, so I want to acquire as many assets as possible. David Lee is not horrible. However, its his contract which sucks. Hopefully we can just take on assets and trade them to move up i the draft. Im just freaking out and hoping for something better than this. The Lakers should be in the playoffs, not feeding at the bottom."
lakers,3bypse,Notalent13,0,Fri Jul 3 07:02:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't agree with the people saying its fine for us to strike out on FA's this year. With Lilliard resigned and Butler having taken the max offered to him rather than just the one year tender, there is absolutely nothing for us in next years free agency but Durant, and Durant won't come to LA if we don't look like we are on the verge of being a deep playoff team. We won't get shit in the draft as is most likely, so, we NEED something in this FA period, there is no advantage to tanking, absolutely none."
lakers,3bypse,thesplashman,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:05:37 2015 UTC,"If there are no free agents next year then what's the point of signing mediocre talent? Winning 31 games over 19 is meaningless unless you're trying to seem like a more viable FA destination, but like you said, there aren't free agents.  You can't tell me if we tanked and had Jaylen Brown in 12 months time that's not an advantage. I say we roll the dice. Every contender had some luck at one point or another, it's about a 50/50 chance we should really consider taking."
lakers,3bypse,Notalent13,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:46:24 2015 UTC,"So your suggesting we hyper tank and absolutely pray beyond a shadow of hope that we get a top 3 pick? Because otherwise we don't get shit, the 76'ers own our pick. Further if we tank, and say get the 4th pick, we are in much, much worse position than if we at least play ok this year, since maybe in the 2017 FA class we will have people who want to sign here for a competitive team"
lakers,3bypse,thesplashman,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:50:34 2015 UTC,"The 2017 class isn't looking at your record 2 years ago, and what's the difference if you convey your pick as the 4th or the 8th? Sure it's more disappointing, but it's exactly the same effect.  If we finish somewhere in the bottom 3, chances are we keep it. At the end of the day, even if we sign Kostas Koufos or whoever, we're just going to be a few slots higher praying that 15% comes off when it easily could have been 50+%."
lakers,3bypse,Notalent13,1 point,Fri Jul 3 07:55:47 2015 UTC,"Lets make this clear, if we get nothing this year, don't get the draft pick, we will get nothing next year. Period. I mean sure a lottery pick will be nice to have again in 2017, but that's all we can look forward to if we can't at least appear competitive by 2017.  Also, we aren't out tanking the 76'ers themselves, who are somehow worse than they were last year. I'm not sure we can out tank the Knicks, who are also, probably even worse this year."
lakers,3bypse,thesplashman,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:02:19 2015 UTC,"I don't see who we're giving up on getting this year that would put us in a much better position to sign guys next year. D'Angelo, Julius and Clarkson will be the attractions basketball wise.  But don't worry, I trust Byron to keep us bottom 3 for sure. It's us and Philly with Denver trying to join the party. Timberwolves will be better and healthier, and the Knicks aren't on our level anymore with Lopez, Afflalo and a healthy Melo."

lakers,3bu9xv,TheAsianMamba,24,Thu Jul 2 05:10:53 2015 UTC,"These ""sources"" are completely trolling NBA fans.  They know that any headline about the Lakers failing will get immediate clicks.  I think they're completely fabricating this bullshit and feeding the anti-Laker circle jerk."
lakers,3bu9xv,ThomasFurke,9,Thu Jul 2 06:06:03 2015 UTC,agree with you 100%. Media is just kicking the Lakers while they are down because it's the easy thing to do. Don't see anyone talking shit about how poorly the meetings of other teams went who will lose out on DJ and LA.
lakers,3bu9xv,kissmyash24,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:09:48 2015 UTC,To be fair this is also happening to the Knicks. It's just more captivating when bad stuff happens to glamorous cities. Portland is being ripped apart this offseason and it's barely making news anywhere.
lakers,3bu9xv,TheMurkyMerc,44,Thu Jul 2 16:55:03 2015 UTC,These clown reporters on social media need to stop with the bullshit. It's so easy to pick on the Lakers now and it seems that is what everyone wants to do. There is no way in hell the Lakers are being unprofessional in these meetings- as Kobe said the social media reporters are full of shit.
lakers,3bu9xv,kissmyash24,4,Thu Jul 2 05:24:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is saying the Lakers have been unprofessional during these meetings. More so that the Lakers have been underwhelming which has been a trend, fairly or unfairly, for the past 2 years."
lakers,3bu9xv,RickDescartes,6,Thu Jul 2 06:03:45 2015 UTC,"I don't believe the underwhelming part either. The Lakers should never even have been in the running for DJ or LA, but because we have cap space and big brand name we were. I have no doubt that Mitch and company are doing the best they can with the talent they presently have. Our team is in transition from the Kobe era to the future and our chances with stars like DJ and LA is rightfully slim."
lakers,3bu9xv,kissmyash24,6,Thu Jul 2 06:07:12 2015 UTC,"If anything we MIGHT have a shot for DJ. I have more faith in the Lakers than that. DJ is young, is looking for more money, and is looking for a spot where he can flourish while taking on more offensive responsibility. He can have both with the Lakers (while not worrying about having to move his entire life to Dallas), especially with a combo guard in D'angelo Russell who will most definitely make the players around him better and provide them with solid looks. The Mavs are in a fairly similar state as we are. They don't have a solid Point Guard (they have Devin Harris and Raymond Felton) or youth like us but have a good relationship between DJ and Parsons. Its a crap shoot.   I know chances are slim, as they have been, but part of me will still hold hope. Because its kind of all we have at this point."
lakers,3bu9xv,thevisitor,3,Thu Jul 2 07:14:55 2015 UTC,more than likely he'll stay with the clippers.

lakers,3bvcff,rl3191,5,Thu Jul 2 13:51:51 2015 UTC,The Avengers singing with the Lakers confirmed!
lakers,3bvcff,aveydey,7,Thu Jul 2 14:33:27 2015 UTC,CHOO CHOO UPSHAW HYPE EXPRESS!!! Get ready for him to block 20 shots a game!!
lakers,3bvcff,readem_n_weep,4,Thu Jul 2 14:39:06 2015 UTC,20 because he's a rookie
lakers,3bvcff,aveydey,3,Thu Jul 2 16:09:05 2015 UTC,Of course. We know his career average will be 40 blocks 20 assists 4 points.
lakers,3bvcff,Buckelroo,11,Thu Jul 2 19:07:32 2015 UTC,"Along with Tarik and Sacre so far. Ed Davis and Jordan Hill still haven't signed with anyone. There's still Koufus and Robin Lopez out there, either of those guys would help."
lakers,3bvcff,StealthRUs,8,Thu Jul 2 13:32:10 2015 UTC,"Just bring back Davis and let Hill walk.  Black, Randle, Davis, Upshaw, and Sacre is enough of a PF/C rotation."
lakers,3bvcff,erehpzomta,3,Thu Jul 2 13:58:10 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, Larry Nance Jr. is a PF too right?"

lakers,3bvcff,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:11:43 2015 UTC,Yep.  There we go.  We're more than covered at C/PF.
lakers,3bvcff,erehpzomta,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:26:08 2015 UTC,I just remembered that we have Ryan Kelly as well. Very covered at PF.
lakers,3bvcff,aveydey,3,Thu Jul 2 16:53:34 2015 UTC,Shit. I guess I can live with this. Let's hope the analysts are right when they talk about the C no longer being the most important player on the floor.
lakers,3bvcff,SpaceCowboy170,3,Thu Jul 2 14:38:40 2015 UTC,"Greg Monroe and RoLo are still out there, and we still have Tarik"

lakers,3bvcff,metrofeed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:23:07 2015 UTC,"I doubt we get Robin Lopez unless we overpay, which would be a mistake given his injury history. No idea what we should do, seems like next year is another non playoff year."
lakers,3bvcff,mikeoley,2,Thu Jul 2 15:26:21 2015 UTC,It was going to be regardless. Gotta have patience with this young team and let them grow.
lakers,3bvcff,metrofeed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:47:11 2015 UTC,I'm on board. But I am getting sick of not even being close to a playoff team. Maybe somebody will shake loose somewhere and there will be a shot at an 8 seed :/
lakers,3bvcff,readem_n_weep,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:35:33 2015 UTC,So Robin Lopez makes or breaks our season?
lakers,3bvcff,manonthemoon14,2,Thu Jul 2 16:09:53 2015 UTC,"Regardless Season is broke as in terms of playoffs but we get to watch the potential and growth of d angelo, Julius, Clarkson, Tarik, Upshaw"
lakers,3bvcff,readem_n_weep,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:33:48 2015 UTC,Totally. Best case scenario in my eyes.
lakers,3bvcff,BionicSix,3,Thu Jul 2 20:51:17 2015 UTC,"My opening night lineup has Clarkson/Russell Kobe/Randle and Upshaw - 4/5 rookie lineup.  Let it grow, have Black, A. Brown, Price, Nance off the bench.  I would watch every game - unlike last year where it was physically painful for me to watch that mess."
lakers,3bvcff,aveydey,5,Thu Jul 2 15:27:14 2015 UTC,I like Kobe as the new Kareem.
lakers,3bvcff,BionicSix,3,Thu Jul 2 15:28:35 2015 UTC,"I like this - when Magic first came in, it was clear he was the best player, but he kept deferring to The Cap, while simultaneously taking charge of the games.  I hope Russell is in the Magic role and Kobe in the Kareem role."
lakers,3bvcff,jimmy_wild1,3,Thu Jul 2 15:45:43 2015 UTC,Kareem won the MVP Magic's rookie year. Magic overtook Kareem sometime around 1985/1986

lakers,3bvcff,troutandabout,3,Thu Jul 2 20:36:29 2015 UTC,"We're not even guaranteed Upshaw. Because he's only on our summer league team, any team can still go out and sign him right now."

lakers,3bvcff,thevision24,3,Thu Jul 2 16:32:41 2015 UTC,"Ed Davis, RoLo, Bismack Biyombo, Kosta Koufos"
lakers,3bvcff,Trontaun79,2,Thu Jul 2 16:41:09 2015 UTC,"Everyone is thirsty for a rim protector, I'd go with Biyombo.  He's younger than RoLo, better defensively stat wise and will likely be much cheaper to sign.  I think the Knicks in particular are going to throw a lot of money RoLo's way after missing out on Monroe, not worth bidding with them over such little talent."
lakers,3bvcff,Bsollenb,2,Thu Jul 2 16:19:23 2015 UTC,I'm sure this is exactly the kind of pressure his mind is ready for.
lakers,3bvcff,C3PO1Fan,2,Thu Jul 2 16:30:04 2015 UTC,It is a poor decision to invest hope in a guy who's undrafted and at this time unsigned to any NBA team (players have no obligation/commitment to their summer league teams).  He might be good!  But at this point you're setting yourself up for disappointment if eggs are in his basket.
lakers,3bvcff,StealthRUs,0,Thu Jul 2 15:06:28 2015 UTC,"Our eggs aren't in Upshaw's basket.  We aren't going anywhere, so we might as well take a flier on this guy.  We could waste money on RoLo or we could give Upshaw a lot of minutes with the potential of him turning into another Hassan Whiteside."
lakers,3bvcff,high5ghost,3,Thu Jul 2 15:17:21 2015 UTC,"I think its sensible to not place to much pressure on an undrafted rookie center who's has a bunch of red flags. Signing another center  to start would help him transition into the NBA and he would still get lots of minutes regardless.   In any case it would be foolish to give him the starting job before seeing if he's actually good. Also Hassan Whiteside was drafted in 2010 and only now are we seeing how talented he is. If Upshaw needs 4/5 years to do the same, it would be a terrible move."
lakers,3bvcff,StealthRUs,-1,Thu Jul 2 15:27:37 2015 UTC,"Signing another center to start would help him transition into the NBA and he would still get lots of minutes regardless.    Yeah, but we already have Tarik Black as well.  What about his development?"
lakers,3bvcff,high5ghost,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:15:10 2015 UTC,"We only have Black and Sacre right now. Sacre the GOAT mostly sits on the bench. Black and Upshaw would be behind our starting center. Scott is probably gonna give more time to who ever he believes deserves it. Look I'm pretty sure we're going to sign a center regardless this summer. All I want is that our FO focusses on finding that center now, rather than in a couple weeks when the options are limited."
lakers,3bvcff,StealthRUs,-1,Thu Jul 2 16:22:11 2015 UTC,And you're taking minutes from Black and Upshaw and giving them to a guy that likely won't be around when this team is finally ready to contend again.  It's a waste of time and money.
lakers,3bvcff,high5ghost,2,Thu Jul 2 16:30:02 2015 UTC,"We have to spend that money regardless. What would you do with the money? Why should we give Black and Upshaw all our minutes at Center. We've never seen Upshaw play against an NBA team and do you think that Black is our center of the future?   Also signing players next year or the years after is going to potentially be a bigger waste of money, everyone will have cap space and no one, not teams/players/agents, know what FA season is going to be like."
lakers,3bvcff,ashishvp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:00:27 2015 UTC,Do we even have the rights to upshaw?   I thought hes a free agent after summer
lakers,3bvcff,ashishvp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:42:56 2015 UTC,"he is, but if he chose us for summer league, he probably has interest to play here."
lakers,3bxmfl,rejectx,7,Fri Jul 3 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"No, that's a 35 win team."
lakers,3bxmfl,Tbuckelew,3,Fri Jul 3 00:16:34 2015 UTC,"which is most definitely a step in the right direction. I won't be ""thrilled"" with 35 wins, but that's a decent goal. As long as we can improve and build our core together."
lakers,3bxmfl,badguymatt,3,Fri Jul 3 01:36:15 2015 UTC,Id say that's a 40 win team. It all depends on how the rookies perform
lakers,3bxmfl,swaggerqueen16,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:18:00 2015 UTC,That is like a 30-40 win team maybe

lakers,3bwbj6,Ray3142,2,Thu Jul 2 18:05:34 2015 UTC,My opinion doesnt mean shit but i am completely on board with rebuilding the proper way. Doesnt look like we have much of a choice anyway but no more shortcuts for me.
lakers,3bwbj6,harleq01,2,Thu Jul 2 19:36:51 2015 UTC,Kobe was selling the fact that Mitch always works to do the right thing and make the team better.   LMA and Kobe know that this years Lakers team is not talented and they have a lot of work in front of them.   Kobe was trying to prove the point that Mitch is reliable when it comes to working towards building a contending team and putting things in place.

lakers,3bxkdj,Scabandiri,6,Thu Jul 2 23:56:39 2015 UTC,I think he's waiting out to see where LMA goes. IIRC the two still want to play together. I think if we can get LMA we need to find a way to unload Swaggy to get Lopez.
lakers,3bxkdj,Wateriswet1212,4,Fri Jul 3 00:00:16 2015 UTC,I don't get it either.  Hopefully these two attention whores DeAndre and Aldridge sign with the Clippers and Spurs and we can finally set our sights on Rolo/Harris/Koufos before they're gone.
lakers,3bxkdj,JustAGuy993,2,Fri Jul 3 00:08:59 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that he is the more realistic option, but LMA giving us a second meeting must mean something, and we'd be fools for not taking the opportunity."

lakers,3bsxo5,zunick,48,Wed Jul 1 21:59:08 2015 UTC,No he's saying LMA camp just aren't douchbags. They plan to tell Lakers directly. Not thru the media. Doesn't change the facts though that LMA thoughts on the Lakers and kobe already leaked out. Just means the official Denial hasn't come and when it does Lakers will know first hand as that's the professional thing to do.
lakers,3bsxo5,mes8007,7,Wed Jul 1 22:04:23 2015 UTC,What thoughts on Kobe did they have. I keep seeing this but the only thing I have read was that Kobe said it would be like him and Pau. Nothing from the LMA camp about Kobe. As for your first statement that they plan to tell the Lakers directly you immediately contradict it by saying they leaked their thoughts.
lakers,3bsxo5,sonofsmog,5,Wed Jul 1 22:12:21 2015 UTC,"No someone leaked it in a unofficial capacity. Could have been anyone involved in the meeting or anyone close to LMA camp. These reporters don't name sources. Could be LMA cousin who text him all day for all we know.  But the official statement of deciding clearly against us is still to come with Lakers receiving the call before the media. This is all I am saying And ""on Kobe"". I'm refferig to the leaked information of LMA feeling as though he didn't "" gel"" with Kobe."
lakers,3bsxo5,mes8007,2,Wed Jul 1 22:23:22 2015 UTC,"There was no such statement that I saw. Supposedly he didn't like the  ""basketball side of the presentation"" whatever that means, but it didn't include any reference to Kobe."
lakers,3bsxo5,sonofsmog,5,Wed Jul 1 22:26:30 2015 UTC,"Mike tweeted it... Tweet from @Mike_Bresnahan: More LMA: He and Kobe didn't quite gel. It's a little vague, but Aldridge apparently didn't quite get answers from Kobe he was seeking."

lakers,3bsxo5,omarciddo,-1,Thu Jul 2 00:01:44 2015 UTC,"Listen, Kobe is great, he's one of the best ever and I respect him and his opinion but I totally agree. WTF is he even in on these meetings?"

lakers,3bsxo5,owningypsie,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:18:01 2015 UTC,"It's unprofessional to deny a story reported by the media and then come out publicly and reiterate the contents of the report as if your denial didn't happen. I don't think they will own their reasons, they will just tell the winner of the sweepstakes LMA is coming and all the others will get the message then."
lakers,3bsxo5,mes8007,3,Thu Jul 2 01:17:49 2015 UTC,"It's a mess now.. Lakers official twitter account deleted all of their LMA tweets.. The whole thing is a mess and LMA camp (regardless of intent) has officially embarrassed our organization when we treated him with nothing but respect. I doubt he calls now, with the way things. I respect the damage control they tried. But it had already spiralled out of control with blogs and media springing up negative articles on Lakers free agency meetings presentation. Unfortunate."

lakers,3bsxo5,ControlAgent13,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:14:35 2015 UTC,"That was my first thought, but he's going to get the max no matter where he goes, not sure there is much leverage if this is his move."
lakers,3bsxo5,Chilled_Penguin,52,Thu Jul 2 00:26:50 2015 UTC,Translation: Agent wants to still use possibility of Lakers as leverage with Spurs
lakers,3bsxo5,FuckTheClippers,13,Wed Jul 1 22:21:07 2015 UTC,Leverage for what? It's not like the Spurs can offer more than the max
lakers,3bsxo5,amarstan,3,Wed Jul 1 22:57:01 2015 UTC,"It's small stuff in the contract that usually doesn't get reported I.e. trade kickers, performance bonuses, etc."
lakers,3bsxo5,Titanosaurus,2,Wed Jul 1 23:46:04 2015 UTC,It is the max K allowable under the CBA. There's nothing to be negotiated. This is why they're pushing back so hard.
lakers,3bsxo5,jskim2180,2,Thu Jul 2 05:38:59 2015 UTC,"Wait, why would he need to leverage against the spurs. It's not like the spurs won't offer him the max."
lakers,3bsxo5,owningypsie,0,Thu Jul 2 01:04:20 2015 UTC,He doesn't need Lakers for leverage. He already has all the leverage he can get. If anything (assuming this is true) this tells me that LMA is still considering Lakers as an option - they don't want Lakers to move on and sign someone else.
lakers,3bsxo5,drewbagel423,2,Thu Jul 2 01:01:07 2015 UTC,All sources of leverage help in a contract negotiation.

lakers,3bsxo5,UltraFlyingTurtle,7,Thu Jul 2 15:16:12 2015 UTC,I'm not surprised not am I too worried. I don't feel like the lakers are really in a win now position. We don't have the superstar kobe of the past what we have is a legend who's end is on the horizon as much as it hurts me to say it. What we do have are young prospects who can turn into something special. We are a rebuilding team and I don't feel like LMA necessarily fits into that mode. He's a guy who's about to hit his prime years but after so many years of playoff exits and misses with the Blazers if I were him I'd be looking to win. Money is always a factor but if you have the passion for this sport like I think he does then winning is something that is essentially 1a.   He's got a better chance and doing some major impact on teams like the rockets or the better spot which is the Spurs. For LMA the lakers are simply not the prime destination at the moment. Guys like Monroe though are solid pieces to try and get because of his age and position. We should be listed owing at pieces that will help strengthen this team and make us a contender over the next 3-5 years versus trying to get a piece that is like Aldridge and trying to put together a win now team.
lakers,3bsxo5,padowan,3,Wed Jul 1 22:29:00 2015 UTC,"As much as I'm not that enamored with Monroe, I think you make good points. He's young, productive, and can grow with the team's (very) young core. The 90's young bigmen in Divac and Elden Campbell had deficiencies, but it was fun to watch them improve every year, along with the then-new guards Van Exel and Eddie Jones, so I'm hoping Monroe will do the same with Russell, Clarkson, Randall.   When the team is ready in the next several years, able to make the playoffs regularly, maybe hovering between the 4th or 6th seeds, they can hopefully then land big time free agents to put them into contention."
lakers,3bsxo5,chief-yeezy,15,Wed Jul 1 23:31:14 2015 UTC,Lol it's so funny how we're all sitting here freaking out about the future of our franchise when in reality the Lakers FO is probably chillin...This is their job and truly remember that in Mitch We Trust. He's not sitting around and doing nothing; let things play out! Sure we probably won't get LaMarcus but there's still so much time left in free agency. It's the first day people!
lakers,3bsxo5,GeorgeLovesBOSCO,7,Wed Jul 1 22:00:46 2015 UTC,I hope they aren't just chilling... Lol
lakers,3bsxo5,TuneHD,10,Wed Jul 1 22:13:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hope Mitch is panicking and offering Robin Lopez the max. /s"
lakers,3bsxo5,GeorgeLovesBOSCO,-3,Wed Jul 1 22:25:49 2015 UTC,"No, panicking is how you end up being a middle of the pack team. Don't settle, just be patient. We don't need to make shortsighted, impulse moves."

lakers,3bsxo5,Ksanti,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:01:24 2015 UTC,I'd be okay with becoming middle of the pack by next year so that we actually have something to pitch to free agents next year
lakers,3bsxo5,TuneHD,3,Wed Jul 1 22:55:38 2015 UTC,Yeah but panic offering mediocre FAs big money to become middle of the pack is how you wind up pissing all our cap space up the wall. Keeping cap space and focusing on a talented young development core of Clarkson Randle Russell is how you build an attractive team for coordinated contracts.
lakers,3bsxo5,thevisitor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:34:15 2015 UTC,"Except if we're offering max contracts, we have nobody and nothing to pitch. We'd have no cap space unless we manage to trade them, but then we're back at square one. I'm ok with signing role players and veterans for decent prices on shorter contracts, but tying up our cap space with above average guys for max is going to hurt in the long run."
lakers,3bsxo5,TuneHD,0,Thu Jul 2 00:36:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, of course. I'm not saying to max every breathing thing out there, but to at least make an active effort to give decent deals to decent players, if not for the sake of getting good starters, then for the sake of building depth on such a shallow team. If we really think the likes of Wayne Ellington or Robert Sacre will get us anywhere or will ever feel appealling, we're only fooling ourselves. 3 straight years of the same ""get cheap players on small deals to inevitably strike out on free agency"" strategy would only hurt even more lol.   The goal in this off season now shouldn't be to have one dramatic makeover from just one off season by trying to max out players and losing out on both them and moderate level free agents, but to gradually develop into a competent team that free agents would actually want to be a part of purely for solid basketball reasons next year or the year after. We cant rely on the draft anymore because our pick is going to Philly most likely."
lakers,3bsxo5,Aynatix,2,Thu Jul 2 00:53:14 2015 UTC,"We should be going for players like Chandler, Green, and Middleton (although they're taken, just examples). People like Harris and Carroll just aren't worth the max. We need to fill out the roster with veterans to help the young guys grow and role players. I'm really hoping in the future we can have Danny Green or Trevor Ariza somehow when we're in playoff mode, or Brown can become that type of player."

lakers,3bsxo5,Aynatix,0,Thu Jul 2 02:43:29 2015 UTC,"No, hopefully we can still make a few solid pick-ups. Tobias Harris please."

All our guys are our young guys except for Nick young and Sacre.  And they don't want to sign and trade for Hill. Hill isn't that valuable to lose a expiring contract and take on a bad Hi contract of about 12 mil for next 3 yrs.

lakers,3bugs4,DA40_in_the_rough,0,Thu Jul 2 07:19:21 2015 UTC,"Oh yea he's loads better defiantly, it's just I remember him disappearing quite a lot in pacers playoff games. But he was once a all star so I'd like if he can bring it back. Still only 28 yrs old."
lakers,3bugs4,vino23,2,Thu Jul 2 07:33:06 2015 UTC,"No... getting mediocre players so that we can feel like we ""salvaged"" an offseason is a terrible idea.  Sometimes no move is better than making a move.  Save the space and go hard after 2016/2017 free agent max players is my suggestion."
lakers,3bugs4,ReallyGoodUsername,3,Thu Jul 2 07:15:22 2015 UTC,"I agree but at the same time we have to create a team thats attractive for free agents in 2016/2017. If we're mediocre again, its going to be tough to pry a big FA away."
lakers,3bugs4,darkshark21,2,Thu Jul 2 15:05:11 2015 UTC,Trading for Hibbert wouldn't hurt our space in 2016/2017. Harris would and I agree on not signing him but I'd love Hibbert on this team.
lakers,3bugs4,StealthRUs,2,Thu Jul 2 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"His contract would expire after next season. So it wouldn't mess with anything at all.  But for Tobias Harris, yeah it would."
lakers,3bugs4,jaysteezy24,0,Thu Jul 2 18:38:31 2015 UTC,I wish more people on here thought this way.
lakers,3bugs4,StealthRUs,2,Thu Jul 2 13:40:23 2015 UTC,"Hibbert too weak mentally, Kobe going to eat him alive and he won't be able to handle the expectations LA fans will give to him. And with our team looking the way it is now I'm not sure if a slow center is the best choice. His defense is good, but the fact that he can't get up and down the court really limits what we can do."
lakers,3bugs4,misterrunon,-2,Thu Jul 2 07:07:44 2015 UTC,Kobe could eat guys alive when he was performing.  Now his antics just piss guys off because he can't get it done on the court anymore.
lakers,3bugs4,TuneHD,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:39:36 2015 UTC,I just want Robin Lopez and re-sign Ed Davis. Then wait for next year.
lakers,3bugs4,MrDaveyHavoc,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:25:18 2015 UTC,"I don't want Harris, Hibbert would be good to sign him for a more respectable deal when his expires."

lakers,3bugs4,00argopile,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:57:17 2015 UTC,Honestly Indiana will probably give us a pick or a young guy to package for Hubert since no one wants his fat contract
lakers,3bugs4,chaseeast,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:53:42 2015 UTC,Highly unlikely trade with Indiana picking up Monta Ellis.  And why does everyone want to trade away Young? He is going to be an important backcourt piece coming off the bench.
lakers,3bugs4,owningypsie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:43:15 2015 UTC,No please no Hibbert
lakers,3bugs4,chaseeast,6,Thu Jul 2 06:42:08 2015 UTC,"He has 1 year left and he's better than Hill, Davis, Lopez or any other big left in the FA market."
lakers,3bugs4,Citizen_of_Atlantis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:43:54 2015 UTC,Sacre?
lakers,3bwbfq,EpicMoy,3,Thu Jul 2 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"I honestly want the Lakers to trade for him. He has 1 year left, so we can just salary dump next year by not re-signing him. Also he's still an elite rim defender, something the Lakers could use despite his offensive struggles. We'd just be committing to him for a year."
lakers,3bwbfq,jasoyang,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:12:07 2015 UTC,No thank you. I wouldn't want to commit with Hibbert long term.
lakers,3bwbfq,spudwinkle,-1,Thu Jul 2 18:07:08 2015 UTC,"It would definitely feel like a Bynum part two, named Roy."
lakers,3bx2jg,Duck_Matthew5,5,Thu Jul 2 21:28:14 2015 UTC,"One player is not the missing link, but the trend now is that great players want to play together. To make that happen, you need great players. Signing one big player this offseason gives us more chance to sign others next year, and beyond."
lakers,3bx2jg,metrofeed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"Ok. I agree 100%. However, I still don't see how that changes our position. At best this year with FA signings, we get...what...4th 5th seed? Not likely. Maybe 6 - 8.  Best case scenario as is...8.   Let's say we sneak in as the 8 this year,  isn't that attractive to a star? Let's say we maneuver a pick next year, get another quality young player. Aren't we equally attractive?   I just don't know what the expectation is. Since CP3/Stern, I've resigned to a long haul rebuild, and netting KD or Westbrook eventually. No one else matters, especially sine AD is locked.   Lastly...D'Marcus would have been the only difference maker for us this year, and that saga still isn't over."
lakers,3bx2jg,pistolpete4407,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:45:50 2015 UTC,"It's not missing out on LA, mello, DJ and bron that upsets me, it's the fact that our FO has put ALL of their focus on the big name guys instead of other capable free agents that bother me."
lakers,3bx12z,nluna1975,4,Thu Jul 2 21:16:20 2015 UTC,They are not moving Whiteside.. They have him for pennies on a 2nd chance contract. Whiteside is the kind of player LMA wants to play with.
lakers,3bx12z,mes8007,0,Thu Jul 2 21:18:32 2015 UTC,Is they really want LMA they gonna have to move a valuable piece. Whiteside will hardly be used if they have lma and bosh. Pat is not thinking about the future just the present.
lakers,3bx12z,Buckelroo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:28:38 2015 UTC,you want LMA and Bosh to play 48 minutes a game?
lakers,3bx12z,probotic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:42:21 2015 UTC,Well no player plays 48 minutes a game but in the east they can get away with it.

lakers,3bwz7o,SP1344,2,Thu Jul 2 21:01:17 2015 UTC,"Bandwagon.. Been a fan since I was 2 years old. 25 now. I'm sure there are a lot of people who have been fans for even longer then 23 years. But I have never once liked any other team even for a little, have been a die hard fan since birth and will be until I can't watch TV anymore. Being a die hard fan of this organization and team, means that I also hold our front office to a high standard because they should do everything in their power to put out the best team possible. Right now they are not doing anything close to that... Not asking them to get LMA or DJ. Just to make something happen, show us they care and are being smart. Have a plan. Get Tobias Harris, Get Robin Lopez. Something that improves us."
lakers,3bwz7o,magneto44,3,Thu Jul 2 21:19:24 2015 UTC,Dang you remember the Lakers when you were 2? I only remember as far back as when I was 4-5
lakers,3bwz7o,StealthRUs,0,Thu Jul 2 21:25:34 2015 UTC,"Without some help for our big men we will be one of the worst teams in the NBA.   That's the whole point.     Please WAKE UP LAKERS FRONT OFFICE. Bring in some talent and help to this team ASAP!   Calm the fuck down and embrace the tank.  If you can't do that, you're welcome to get off the bandwagon."
lakers,3bwz7o,JustAGuy993,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:13:23 2015 UTC,The Lakers can't tank.  The chance of them actually being the worst team in the league is slim to none. The chances are simply too high of losing the pick if you are anything but the worst team in the league.
lakers,3bwz7o,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"thank you, exactly my point. Our tanking days are over. We need to build and keep improving. At this point only way to improve is to sign some decent young or position of need Free agents that will help our growth. Unless something insanely drastic happens we won't have draft picks for 3 years. Build from Clarkson/Randle/Russel. Add some pieces which will draw more free agents next year along with the hopeful growth of those 3 players we'll keep improving.   As of now... Please get Tobias Harris/Rolo already!"
lakers,3bwz7o,JustAGuy993,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:40:03 2015 UTC,"Slim to none?  With this team as currently constructed?  Are you serious?   We won 21 games this past season.  We're losing Boozer, Lin, and Davis and replacing them with rookies.  We would be lucky to win 18 games right now."
lakers,3bwz7o,StealthRUs,0,Thu Jul 2 22:49:33 2015 UTC,"Boozer is trash.  Those other two made less of an impact than Kobe and Randle will this year.    Teams that are for sure going to be worse include Denver and Philly, that list will grow if we get Tobias Harris or Rolo."
lakers,3bwz7o,JustAGuy993,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:01:49 2015 UTC,"Randle has 0 games of NBA experience. To expect him to come in and do better than Boozer is crazy.    Everyone on here expects rookies to do way better than they will actually do.  Unless the situation like Magic where they come in surrounded by a loaded finals team, no rookie is going to come in and lead his team to a bunch of wins. Not even LeBron could  do that."
lakers,3bul3p,ImZeTiger,12,Thu Jul 2 07:28:18 2015 UTC,"I'm super excited. Randle, Deangelo, upshaw, Larry Nance, clarkson and the browns..  I can already feel Larry Nance is gonna be fan favorite."

lakers,3btzsf,Binzer777,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:54:12 2015 UTC,Nah its probably not your opinion. It's essentially a fact he won't leave to come to us at this point
lakers,3btzsf,bmarshall12,3,Thu Jul 2 04:02:00 2015 UTC,Just show him something the Clippers have never earned -  a West Conference title

lakers,3btzsf,GOP_,2,Thu Jul 2 03:50:38 2015 UTC,He's 26 so it would be cool to have him on the Lakers. But he shouldn't. Its his prime and our dark days. He'll be 30 by the time we can contend.

lakers,3btzsf,WVS_SoShi,0,Thu Jul 2 04:58:10 2015 UTC,By offering them both contracts
lakers,3btzsf,titanic_swimteam,0,Thu Jul 2 20:28:41 2015 UTC,We can only afford one max deal. I don't think either Jordan or Aldridge want a 4m/yr contract.

lakers,3btzsf,titanic_swimteam,0,Fri Jul 3 03:35:50 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why I was asking him. It's not realistic at all, why even brought that up."
lakers,3btzsf,WVS_SoShi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:21:40 2015 UTC,"Well, if you want the realistic answer, we would have to trade swaggy p for a second round draft pick and get each of them to take just below the max."
lakers,3btzsf,titanic_swimteam,0,Fri Jul 3 15:32:19 2015 UTC,"13m/yr each is not ""just below the max"". And they definitely won't take anything less than a max."
lakers,3bsdde,hollyw00dhustle,15,Wed Jul 1 19:31:15 2015 UTC,"The Lakers winning this off season doesn't necessarily mean signing the best players, it could also mean not signing any bad contracts. We're rebuilding, with a almost clean slate right now. Go slow and don't make and bad acquisitions and we'll be fine."
lakers,3bsdde,IamHankScorpio,2,Wed Jul 1 19:48:56 2015 UTC,"If the past two free agencies have taught us anything, it's that you can't keep selling promise. We need to either--a) see great development from our young guys this season; and/or b) sign one other player that we can move forward with--in order to attract the big names we all want to sign next summer and beyond."
lakers,3bsdde,owningypsie,44,Thu Jul 2 06:41:21 2015 UTC,100% agree. I'm fine passing on non-max guys. People talking about paying Robin Lopez crazy money? Fuck that. Rather bring in 60 million to 2016.
lakers,3bsdde,ricky_roe,12,Wed Jul 1 19:40:55 2015 UTC,"2016, outside of Durant, doesn't seem to have a very strong free agent class. In 2017, however, we will feast."

lakers,3bsdde,GoingBackToMyWays,6,Wed Jul 1 19:44:23 2015 UTC,"Griffin, Ibaka, Teague, Curry, surely someone else who will break out in these couple of years"
lakers,3bsdde,PaulKr,2,Wed Jul 1 19:49:51 2015 UTC,"Cool, I hope we could make some noise that summer. Teague or ibaka are probably the only realistic options at this point though."
lakers,3bsdde,GoingBackToMyWays,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:58:17 2015 UTC,"I don't know, if Deandre leaves for Dallas and CP3 starts to regress hard, it would't be too crazy for Griffin switch teams. Would stay in the same city, there aren't really many die hard Clipper fans that he would anger, and the rest would jump on the Lakers bandwagon. Seems pretty realistic."
lakers,3bsdde,PaulKr,-5,Wed Jul 1 20:01:53 2015 UTC,Definitely wouldn't mind Griffin. However he needs to get better in the post and improve his mid-range jumper.

lakers,3bsdde,badguymatt,0,Wed Jul 1 19:45:19 2015 UTC,"KD is the key, and I think we have a chance. Added benefit of KD leaving is that Russ will want out and he's a FA the next year too."
lakers,3bsdde,ricky_roe,17,Wed Jul 1 19:50:15 2015 UTC,We don't have a chance at KD next year.  Just like we didn't have a chance at LMA or Love this year.  Just like we didn't have a chance and Lebron and Carmelo last year.
lakers,3bsdde,StealthRUs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:41:16 2015 UTC,A lot can change in a year. I like to be a bit more glass half full.
lakers,3bsdde,brac20,4,Thu Jul 2 08:43:02 2015 UTC,"Locking Rolo up and overpaying him for one season of crazy money before the cap jumps is probably not a crazy or bad move.  I think there's very little risk that he won't be worth near-current-max dollars after the cap jumps.  Lakers need someone at the 5, and they can squeeze your money out of him in a trade if they want to do something else."
lakers,3bsdde,myLeftTesticleofFury,5,Wed Jul 1 19:56:14 2015 UTC,"We've been saying this for a couple years. Besides, look at 2016's FA class, its Durant and role players. If we strike out on Durant (more than likely) its the same old story."
lakers,3bsdde,FFMonstar,18,Wed Jul 1 20:09:20 2015 UTC,We say that every summer just wait till next year. We'll be saying the same shit next year.
lakers,3bsdde,Fappin_is_Exercise,69,Wed Jul 1 19:45:40 2015 UTC,This is the first full on rebuild since the mid 90's. This isn't the mid-00s where we still had a 25 year old Kobe to work with. Rushing it could fuck us up even worse.
lakers,3bsdde,ricky_roe,21,Wed Jul 1 19:47:53 2015 UTC,At least some people on here have some sense.
lakers,3bsdde,StealthRUs,-10,Wed Jul 1 20:41:55 2015 UTC,"except what has the front office done recently in the past several years to prove this organization is still capable of becoming a championship contender? i really can't think of any. if you can't even land love, alridge, melo, or any other big name free agent, or trade for one, what THE FUCK makes you think you can land durant and westbrook? you really think you can get westbrook or durant to come to LA by telling them that the hollywood hills are a lot of fun, that they'll get to star in movies and party with celebrities? get fucking real. what BASKETBALL reasons would the lakers have to attract guys like westbrook? NONE. the team is shit. the coach is shit. and the front office has shown to be shit for quite some time."
lakers,3bsdde,hanni90,9,Wed Jul 1 22:53:53 2015 UTC,Drafting Russell instead of okafor could prove to be that move that shows the FO is still on their shit. Time will tell. Also clarksons ceiling still isn't a for sure thing. We could see him continue to improve year after year after year. Again only time will tell.
lakers,3bsdde,CAPTAIN_TITTY_BANG,-4,Wed Jul 1 23:16:27 2015 UTC,lakers should have hired a young coach instead of going after a shitty byron scott. their coaching hires are enough to tell me the front office doesn't know what the fuck they're doing.
lakers,3bsdde,hanni90,10,Wed Jul 1 23:55:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I respectfully disagree. We're not in contention right now. Whether he meant to or not, he was a great tank master last season. Not only that, but one huge upside to Scott is he undeniably helps develop guards. Paul, Irving, and we're beginning to see it in clarkson. Hopefully Nash stays around to help Russell and clarkson even more. Not to mention Kobe... We have all the right tools to develop some all star guards. Maybe I'm just being optimistic but I truly believe this is all falling into place quite nicely."
lakers,3bsdde,CAPTAIN_TITTY_BANG,2,Thu Jul 2 00:11:54 2015 UTC,"Ya, how come the Lakers didn't make sure the new CBA has no salary cap, got an income tax exemption from the state of California and put an end to revenue sharing!!!

lakers,3bsdde,JustaGangsta,2,Wed Jul 1 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"It's looking like the Lakers are going to be younger next season, and young teams lose a lot of games even when they try really hard.   I wouldn't try to tank if I was the Lakers because there's still the risk of three teams moving up, but they may legitimately end up in last anyway if Randle and Russell are expected to be the best players on the team next year."
lakers,3bsdde,C3PO1Fan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:43:56 2015 UTC,Kobe hasn't retired yet.
lakers,3bsdde,JustaGangsta,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:04:27 2015 UTC,I think his role is going to be more supportive unless he can roll back the clock a bit more.

lakers,3bsdde,Ibrahimnaldo,3,Thu Jul 2 04:07:22 2015 UTC,yeah but the lakers don't have their pick next year
lakers,3bsdde,danielsilva12345,0,Wed Jul 1 19:50:47 2015 UTC,"We do if it lands in the top three. I hope we win something like 35 games next year, miraculously win the lottery a la Cleveland, then reload for 2017 leaving Philly with a late first rounder"

lakers,3bsdde,manonthemoon14,11,Wed Jul 1 22:09:53 2015 UTC,"I think the ""allure"" to the city of LA is a myth. Big fish free agents go to cities where they 1. Can win 2. Fit in 3. Can get paid. When the Lakers were winning, everyone wanted to be here. Love re-signed with Cleveland because its a winning team. Aldridge will go to the Spurs because they offer the best shot to win. If you haven't noticed, generally free agents are coming from mediocrity - that's why they haven't re-signed or signed extensions. Doesn't make any logical sense to jump from one mediocre team where you can get paid more, to another where you get paid less and you're in the same mediocre situation."
lakers,3bsdde,lemp44,8,Thu Jul 2 00:52:11 2015 UTC,"I agree. If the rumor were true that the pitch they gave LMA was more about 'outside' opportunities rather than actual bball, then it's no surprise why he didn't pick us. These promises of being a star, hangin in Hollywood, being on TV will only get him paid.  What's better? Getting paid and winning."
lakers,3bsdde,impactblue5,9,Wed Jul 1 21:03:03 2015 UTC,"The FO really needs to back off this whole ""Hollywood"" bullshit. It's fucking played and the Clippers offer the same shit with a currently more successful team. Lamarcus already has a fucking house in LA! You don't need to lecture him on the virtues of his second home!  Twice now Houston has delivered better pitches than us. LA might not go to the Rockets, but he was still impressed by their analytics-heavy emphasis. Everything about our pitch reeks of antiquity. ""We got Hollywood, the beach, and bitches amirite"". Be real. Even if you wanted that crap you only really have much time for it during the offseason. You can live anywhere the fuck you want during the offseason."
lakers,3bsdde,omarciddo,6,Wed Jul 1 21:33:02 2015 UTC,"Haha or the tired.. ""You'll follow in the footsteps of some of the best big men in the game.. Wilt, Kareem, Shaq....""  LMA:  Awesome, now those guys got theirs, now tell me how will the FO go about helping me get mine?"
lakers,3bsdde,impactblue5,2,Wed Jul 1 22:41:22 2015 UTC,"LA does have allure but its more like a cherry on top not the whole cake.  If lakers had a deep squad and were competing against a team like SAS for a free agent and were able to offer the same money, sure the city could be a selling point to push a teetering FA to our side. No one wants to come to a shitty team just because its LA."

lakers,3bsdde,inspector_baj3t,17,Wed Jul 1 23:15:29 2015 UTC,"People are trying to come up with other reasons, but it honestly boils down to this."
lakers,3bsdde,mikeoley,14,Wed Jul 1 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't. It comes down to having an elite player that others want to come play with.  Kobe's contract or personality aren't the issue. It's his ability to stay on the court. For better or worse, Kobe appears to be washed up.  Our lottery pick broke his leg in his first game last year. It's not like these guys are coming to play with a ROTY contender and an at least 82 games worth of Kobe.  The Spurs, Suns, Mavs and Portland all have actual proven players on their team and have won 40+ games last year.   Kobe's deal isn't scaring away FAs. It's his age and inability to show he can still play at an elite level."
lakers,3bsdde,amarstan,0,Wed Jul 1 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"No you're right, Kobe saying things like ""I'll show you how to be a champion"" and ""it'll be like me and pau"" to DA have nothing to do with it. The lakers won't be relevant again until he is gone. I don't care if he was healthy and played 82 games. Nobody wants to play with him at this point in his career, Or they would have to have a super passive demeanor like Pau had. No young distinguished star who knows they can ball in this league is gonna be like ""teach me Kobe. Teach me how to win""."
lakers,3bsdde,mikeoley,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:56:12 2015 UTC,"Which is probably why not many of the young guys are being mentioned as all time greats.  The torch is passed, it doesn't just magically fucking appear."
lakers,3bsdde,Risar,7,Thu Jul 2 00:32:21 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. We need to understand that players wouldn't want to come to LA because the Lakers are not particularly good now. Nevertheless, we have a few talented young players. Give Russell and Randle a couple of years and see how they develop. Once we have a bonafide up and comer, the free agents will come. Hopefully, Russell will be that guy."
lakers,3bsdde,aeisenst,5,Thu Jul 2 05:12:43 2015 UTC,I'm with you. We haven't had a homegrown player of any real significance since basically Kobe and Fish.
lakers,3bsdde,omarciddo,3,Wed Jul 1 19:52:34 2015 UTC,I really hope d angelo and Julius can be like that
lakers,3bsdde,manonthemoon14,6,Wed Jul 1 22:46:45 2015 UTC,"The problem is the lakers are going after the wrong free agents. We should be hitting young up and coming guys. No established star is going to leave a contender and come to a rebuilding team, lakers or not especially if we don't have a superstar. Kobe isn't what he used to be. Target free agents based on realistic availability and age."
lakers,3bsdde,megavino,4,Thu Jul 2 00:58:38 2015 UTC,"When is the last time a ""huge"" free agent came to sign with the Lakers anyway? As I recall, it was Shaq in 1996. All these people who say that others teams are geniuses for building their teams over time forgot that Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak built those teams essentially with smart draft choices, wise role player signings, and great coaching. We'll do it the right way this time, too, and hopefully string together another 3-peat in the next decade."
lakers,3bsdde,huskysagehen,3,Wed Jul 1 23:06:17 2015 UTC,I see what you're saying but it is true to a fault. One of the other reasons why LMA is not impressed with the Lakers is because we flat out don't have anyone of worth on our team. The Lakers offered him just as much money as the other teams did. You need to land some pieces that make you considerably better before next off season so that these free agents actually believe they will contend if they join.
lakers,3bsdde,thevisitor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:47:00 2015 UTC,"Just my opinion, but I think the Lakers were hoping he'd be open to playing the 5 w/ Randle at the 4. I don't think they  want Randle coming off the bench."
lakers,3bsdde,ricky_roe,3,Wed Jul 1 19:43:35 2015 UTC,"While it leaves a bad taste that the spurs FO is making envious moves, we are still reeling from basketball reasons and dwight. As much as I would live LMA and Deandre, they're not gonna suddenly make us a championship contender. We need to make the right moves, not the best moves."
lakers,3bsdde,Titanosaurus,3,Wed Jul 1 19:49:09 2015 UTC,You know i was a little disheartened about today and the draft but getting a defensive minded center and a small forward is taking a big step forward from last season. We don't need big time players who can't play the positions we need to succeed. We need to grow our young players and make sure they will be ready when it's their time to shine. I believe Kobe is one hell of a teacher and he will get them ready to take over. We will progressively get better and our young guys will grow this season but we must be patient about this. If we try to rush this then all we are is just a bunch of Mavericks running around making bad personal decisions. Let's not be them.
lakers,3bsdde,nluna1975,2,Wed Jul 1 20:39:10 2015 UTC,"Does nobody realize we possibly got the steal of the draft with having 7' center Robert Upshaw? Plus, if he produces (and our young guards/Randle as well) and we don't pay anyone this summer, even tons of more money to hand out next summer!  We'll be fine"
lakers,3bsdde,ArbitraryLurker24,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:41:47 2015 UTC,This. This kid has the ability to be a huge steal and the best part is we won't be expecting anything from him offensively. He just has to play defense and rebound. If he stays out of trouble and puts the time in then he has a chance to be successful in the nba as a defensive center
lakers,3bsdde,virji24,2,Wed Jul 1 21:45:11 2015 UTC,"I miss watching basketball like I used to, I struggled watching Lakers games past two seasons."
lakers,3bsdde,Triflin01,2,Wed Jul 1 23:03:44 2015 UTC,Same but now we can look forward to the development of Julius and d angelo and watch them grow together
lakers,3bsdde,manonthemoon14,2,Wed Jul 1 21:47:52 2015 UTC,"I think the best the Lakers can do is fill in some strategic holes and ride on their young core. Show enough potential to draw in guys like Durant. I hope Russell shines in his first year. An ROTY and lots of spots on ESPN highlights will surely get outsiders excited at the prospects of joining LA. That, and figure out the coaching circus. Scott is not championship material as far as coaches go."
lakers,3bsdde,unix04,2,Thu Jul 2 01:00:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Finally someone with a thread that makes sense. Can someone tell me when LaMarcus Aldridge became Hakeem Olajuwon? Let's not forget he is 30 years old. Isn't the whole process of our team to become younger, faster, better? Not older, slower and worse. The smart play here is to go for young guys like Tobias Harris and Ed Davis. And then go for the big fish next year. Aldridge did us a favor, he would have hurt us big time the next few years. Eye on the prize guys if this is next year with KD then I get it. But lets focus on getting a good core. Lakers will be back!!!!"
lakers,3bsdde,spartan7828,2,Wed Jul 1 23:51:07 2015 UTC,"Trying to bring in one notable free agent is not ""swinging for the fences."" We will have room for 2 max free agents next summer even if we spend on one this summer. And we are much more likely to attract FAs next summer if we have already convinced another top 20 player to sign."
lakers,3bsdde,owningypsie,2,Thu Jul 2 00:57:34 2015 UTC,"We don't need to be successful this season. I'm even happy the way the roster is currently. It could be Kobe's last season, but all good things must come to an end. The Lakers do have a young core and getting useful experience is necessary. The Lakers have a young core with potential.   D'Angelo Russell (19)   Julius Randle (20)  Larry Nance, Jr. (22)  Anthony Brown (22)  Jabari Brown (22)  Jordan Clarkson (23)  Tarik Black (23)  Ryan Kelly (24)   Robert Sacre (26)   Robert Upshaw**(21)"

lakers,3bsdde,jtingin25,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:50:06 2015 UTC,Wouldn't mind getting him. The Lakers shouldn't be putting all their eggs in one basket for KD.

lakers,3bsdde,B0NERSTORM,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:26:51 2015 UTC,Lol. Then he will step down then. The lakers won't win 40 games which might not be good enough for 10th place.

lakers,3bsdde,camlawson24,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:13:21 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I wasn't expecting the Lakers to make a big splash this free agency. Frankly, what do we have to offer? We have the Mamba on his last legs, unproven young guys, and the women, weed and weather (shoutout to k-dot).  I'm looking at next year. Kobe comes off the books, and if the young talent develops well it look more attractive for those big fish (KD, Russ, BG, etc.) to come and lead this group. Or if one of these guys turns into a superstar talent? Even better.  Plus, its the first friggin' day FA. Mitch knows what he's doing. The dominos started to fall for the Lakers last year too once we knew we weren't getting Melo and the lot.  Stay calm fam."
lakers,3bsdde,AhKEYno,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:22:35 2015 UTC,"This is how our front office has been operating. We have 3 quality prospects that can grow together. Any of them can make a leap (especially learning from Kobe) and make us attractive to free agents. The key is not to clog up our salary with bad and over priced contracts.  Swing at LA, Butler, and Jordan. Be cautious with the rest. Glad we don't have to go after Rondo anymore."
lakers,3bsdde,TheWizard77,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:37:54 2015 UTC,"yes, lets not over commit to a mid level guy just because we missed on the big names.  that asik contract NO just gave would be a good example"

But the Spurs also have a huge advantage over us because their players don't pay state income taxes.   Texas...  Next CBA needs to include a provision so that the salary cap counts after tax income. Eliminate that from the discussion.  Keep in mind, who was the last big Free Agent any of the CA teams signed?"

Dirk is a complementary player at this point and Parsons is injured. They don't have a point guard, shooting guard or center. They are rebuilding with no promising young players. Lakers at least have Russell, Clarkson and Randle for youth. Kobe is Kobe and they have cap space and an ownership group that wants to win."

lakers,3bt8en,lakeshowtime,2,Thu Jul 2 05:40:25 2015 UTC,It is a factor. I think we losing out because we are just not good. If Russell and Randle ball out the free agents will come. Right now everyone is looking at a ton of unknowns.

Unproved yet.. We have JC.. he is a somewhat proved himself, but we need another year to truely know if he is legit or not... We have Kobe... Kobe prime? No.. damn im out..   This is why I hopeee Russel, Randle, Jc, and a few others just ball out so KD and the other FA in 2016 will be drooling to come to LA."
lakers,3bt8en,vino23,5,Thu Jul 2 07:41:58 2015 UTC,"If the media wasn't spewing nonsense saying that every SINGLE FA was interested in joining the Lakers, there honestly wouldn't be so much whining. Its just hard not to get excited as a fan when everyones saying we have a legit shot at a big name free agent that will make our rebuilding process A TON easier."
lakers,3bt8en,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:56:51 2015 UTC,People need to stop believing everything they read.
lakers,3bt8en,p0se1d0n,15,Thu Jul 2 06:56:08 2015 UTC,For me it's not that the Lakers lost out in LMA or any other premier FA.  I'm more disturbed hearing how the Lakers are conducting themselves in these meetings and how they haven't learned anything from their dealings with Dwight and Melo the past couple of years.   It's time that Magic and the Guggenheim Partners Group seriously look into buying the team from the inept Buss children.
lakers,3bt8en,chargerland,14,Thu Jul 2 01:09:17 2015 UTC,"It's difficult to sell free agents on the basketball side of things. LMA is 30 years old, I don't think he'll be sold on the possibility of Durant in a year, or Russell/Clarkson/Randle being good in a few years. It could work for DJ, since he's young, but I doubt he'll leave the Clippers. One day we'll be attractive to big name free agents, it's just not going to happen this year."
lakers,3bt8en,FuriousFlex,4,Thu Jul 2 01:22:25 2015 UTC,All these players are in win now mode. Lakers need to build their core and prove if some of these fa come to L.A. then they can win.. Look at the Cavs. They had a few pieces and lebron said if I go back home excuse these players. I can work with. Look what happened.
lakers,3bt8en,manonthemoon14,2,Thu Jul 2 05:43:13 2015 UTC,THIS
lakers,3bt8en,nigg_a,0,Thu Jul 2 02:40:14 2015 UTC,Kobe said it to aldridge himself during the meeting stating that if he went to the spurs he would win a ring but homestly have no future. That was what the lakers were trying to sell. Not hollywood as the reporters keeping lying about but rather a future just like they did with the shaq in 96 when magic left with aids and kobe signed. We had a unproven star named Kobe just like we have with russell and randle. They were trying to sell him a dynasty and not a 1 or 2 time playoff run like with the spurs who are aging and almost going to retire and may not be able to compete with some of the younger competition like the okc thunder or the warriors. Aldridge can either get 1 ring before duncan retires and his contract ends or get a series of championships with a young core. One hit wonders vs a Dynasty
lakers,3bt8en,DeanBlandino,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:19:55 2015 UTC,"LMA is also looking at a core of kawhi and green and a coach in pop. The best the Lakers could offer is 2 rookies and a coach that doesn't like 3pt shooting. The lakers need to stabalize their team under the new ownership. Maybe Durant comes, and he's the only one so far worth taking between Lma/Howard/whoever"
lakers,3bt8en,fearlesspinata,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:34:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I am concerned that were trying to lure people here using the pedigree of our past along with the glitz and glamour of Hollywood to try and get people here. Why not talk basketball? Are we trying to win or are we trying to assemble a team of fabulous? We should try our hardest to pitch basketball and talk about what we're trying to achieve. Be honest with players and tell them our plans moving forward and how we plan to win again. The glitz and glamour of the lakers has always been a side note and never the main page. The main page has always been about winning basketball games and wing winning championships. The way that the FO is conducting itself is ridiculous and it makes me scared for what's to come.  Dr Buss would have never conducted business this way where we come out looking like a joke. Make the winning pitch be focused on basketball not in the money cars stars and bitches.
lakers,3bt8en,SirPovertus,4,Thu Jul 2 01:16:40 2015 UTC,"I think people are being a little bit unfair. What do we even have currently that is attractive enough to bring in a big name like LMA, who btw is turning 30 soon. An aging Kobe that didn't look like his old self last year and is about to retire soon? 2 rookies in Randle and Russel who have yet to prove themselves in the NBA? Let's face reality here, we aren't winning anything in the immediate future. If the meeting was focused specifically on the basketball point of view, phrases like ""few years down the line"" will be thrown around quite often and that is absolutely not attractive to a star that is almost in his 30's and want to win a championship now. I for one totally understand the business focus in these meetings, we just don't have enough talents or assets to talk strictly basketball and winning championships immediately. I am cool with us having another 1 or 2 down years if it means securing a young solid core for many years to come after that."
lakers,3bt8en,fearlesspinata,3,Thu Jul 2 03:22:30 2015 UTC,That's the thing we shouldn't even really be going after a guy like Aldridge to begin with as I don't see it being a beneficial relationship for either party
lakers,3bt8en,DeanBlandino,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:58:12 2015 UTC,"Eh. Losing out on Lma sucks, but the real problem has been the superstars made available. You can't be a shit team and get the best superstar these days due to the age of UFA. But you know what's worse? Committing long term money to a guy like melo or Howard."
lakers,3bt8en,Binzer777,2,Thu Jul 2 15:29:59 2015 UTC,"Obviously they had interest in LMA and visa versa or the meeting wouldn't be the 1st on the agenda for both. The fact its leaked he went in 50/50 on signing then left with a ""no thanks"" is not a good look. So yes I do think they had a shot and they come off looking bad with #La to La nonsense and subsequent leaks"

lakers,3bynad,JustAGuy993,2,Fri Jul 3 05:55:58 2015 UTC,Orlando said that when they were gunning for Millsap. No way they're not matching now that he's back with the Hawks.
lakers,3bynad,Buckelroo,2,Fri Jul 3 06:07:51 2015 UTC,Wasn't that the general sentiment before free agency even started?  Doesn't he not get along with Skiles?
lakers,3bynad,JustAGuy993,2,Fri Jul 3 06:10:52 2015 UTC,Tobias Harris will be matched. They didn't get Millsap. How about Corey Brewer instead? He's the only wing left who can play defense (can't shoot though).
lakers,3bynad,JustAGuy993,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:53:21 2015 UTC,"Why is everyone so convinced he'll be matched?  I remember hearing before FA even started that they didn't want to match a max offer for him.  I thought he and Skiles had issues with eachother as well.    I really don't see why Brewer would leave the Rockets, he's also too old IMO."
lakers,3bynad,lars5,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:37:19 2015 UTC,Well there's probably no harm in submitting an offer sheet for Harris. And Brewer is 29. You need some vets on the team to set an example and also play some defense. There's really no one else except if you want to take a risk on KJ McDaniels.

And when a team is young, every yr they have potential to come back looking improved. Nick young will be Nick young. But Randle will coming back improved. Deangelo can change everything.

lakers,3bsmom,iliketodance_sueme,4,Wed Jul 1 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"the reason the lakers have a mediocre coach is because the front office went full retard and got mike brown, then d'antoni who was THE worst possible coach for when dwight was on the team, not to mention had the inability to mesh all the different egos on the team. phil was by far and away, THE perfect coach and anyone who says he wasn't is a fucking moron. so after the debacle of brown and d'antoni, you went for byron scott, another less than mediocre coach.   the reality is the lakers aren't the organization they once were under dr. buss, so stop telling me the lakers will rebound again because they haven't made ANY moves the past several years that has shown me they'll be championship contenders anytime soon. if you don't see it then you're fucking delusional. the lakers will be a less than average/terrible team for the next several years."
lakers,3bsmom,hanni90,2,Wed Jul 1 22:48:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean of course everyone wanted the GOAT coach. Still not clear on the circumstances surrounding why Phil wasn't hired but the Lakers got the coaches who were supposed to be the best available at that point. D'Antoni was terrible, especially without Nash who he was pretty much brought in specifically for. Mike Brown wasn't given much of a chance so we don't know how good or bad he actually was.

lakers,3bsmom,generalizationz,2,Thu Jul 2 07:45:16 2015 UTC,"Now, the firing of Mike Brown was a knee jerk reaction to a slow start of what mostly caused by playing an outdated system (Princeton Offense - the reasonable approach was to fire Eddie Jordan and promote Messina as Ass. Coach)   Yes they screwed the pooch with hiring Mike D over Phil, yet you must understand Phil was looking to transition into the front office and he wanted a position that would have caused an even more dysfunctional FO. Jimmy Buss is out to prove he is the rightful leader of this organization, and he didn't want his sister's boyfriend butting heads with him. Now, you claim the Lakers are not the same organization but thats not true. The Lakers have acquired great players like Chris Paul and Dwight Howard, and only because the media likes to paint a picture of Jimmy a dysfunctional leader you should be patient and give him a chance. He's a Buss and as long as this family that truly cares for this team is in charge, I'm okay with that."

lakers,3bsmom,TuneHD,28,Wed Jul 1 22:50:05 2015 UTC,"I feel LMA doesn't want any part of playing the Center position. On the Lakers he would have no choice but to play Center. The Rox, Spurs and PHX can give him the PF position he wants. More so with the Rox and PHX as Duncan will have to take games off and he would have to play center then.   It would seem our best way to go is getting Ed Davis back or looking for a defensive minded center and Small Forward."
lakers,3bsmom,nluna1975,7,Wed Jul 1 20:52:09 2015 UTC,Of course the most logical and rational answer is at the bottom needing upvotes.  I can't believe all the irrational Kobe hate in this thread. It feels like r/nba in here
lakers,3bsmom,aveydey,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:58:51 2015 UTC,It's just reactionary. We need someone to blame and unfortunately it's Kobe. I believe the Lakers didn't know about LMA's reluctance to play center and started backtracking and changing the subject when LMA kept asking those questions. I believe that's what turned him off. It seems no one not even Kobe could answer his questions. Just my theory.

We won't be that good next year, especially in the west, but we will have a young core going forward with the chance at having some all star calibre players(clarkson, Russell, and randle). Let them develop. When kobe comes off the books next year you have a lot of cap space. If kobe wants to win then next year he can take a huge pay cut while trying to draw a player like KD over. Once you get a KD its all about putting the right pieces around him to get to a championship contender"

The Lakers brought in fucking TWC execs to the meeting like they did in their meetings with Dwight and Melo. Some players don't give a fuck about that business/marketing shit. The Lakers need to realize this during their next big pitch.

Lots of of people here talk about committing to the rebuild, but our FO isn't acting that way. Instead of making a splash and signing a star, we need to sign solid players and slowly improve bit by bit. We need to sign a solid sf and c.  We just need to operate like the rebuilding teams of the past and keep our young core together. In the meantime sign players like RoLo or Brewer to make the Lakers a team FAs want to come to. In turn these mid-tier players can become awesome assets to trade for players and/or picks.  RoLo isn't an unrealistic player for us. The FO is just waiting on the stars to make their FA decisions. All the while, other teams are picking up all the good mid-tier guys on good contracts. I think that if  we went as hard as we did for LA we'd get him (I don't mean money wise, just attention wise). Maybe we have to slightly overpay to get him here, but guess what any contract we sign this summer will look spectacular in the following years and other teams have been overpaying to attract FAs since the NBA began.

No team ""slowly"" improves by signing mediocre players with no stars in place.  That's what poorly-run teams do that cap themselves out to mediocrity."
lakers,3buk4w,high5ghost,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:06:21 2015 UTC,Yeah you can by making your team solid and respectable you can sign better free agents. Also guys like Lopez might become super valuable mid-season when teams are trying to contend/get deep into the playoffs need a good big man to solidify their rotation. I think he could be an excellent trade piece to get us more talent/picks.   Committing to a rebuild doesn't mean tanking for draft picks or not signing any mid-tier players. You can rebuild in lots of varying ways. One of our biggest advantages is that the team is in LA and gets lots of media attention. So signing a mid-tier guy and trading him later when national attention piques other team's interest (i.e. Jodie Meeks) is a rebuilding strategy we could do.
lakers,3buk4w,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:23:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, because having a team full of mid-tier guys with no superstars that put up ""respectable"" records has worked so well for Denver, Milwaukee, Charlotte, and Detroit for attracting star FAs.     It certainly worked for Minnesota when Kevin Love was there.   Star free agents certainly couldn't wait to come there...if it wasn't for that they capped themselves out on ""respectable"" guys like Pekovic, Kevin Martin, Derrick Williams, JJ Barea, and Chase Budinger."
lakers,3buk4w,high5ghost,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:35:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying anything about a roster full of mid-tier guys. Rather I just think we should good ones for our center and small forward spots.  And the Lakers are in LA not Minnesota, I'm pretty sure that if we had Love and Rubio on our roster we could have attracted stars. Compare the Lakers to Minnesota is just ridiculous in terms of FAs."
lakers,3buk4w,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:43:32 2015 UTC,"Rather I just think we should good ones for our center and small forward spots.   Yeah, but there are no ""good"" Cs and SFs left.  RoLo is mediocre as is Monroe.  Tobias Harris might have potential to develop into a good SF, but we don't know that yet.    Also we have Randle, Nance, Upshaw, and Black that we're trying to develop at PF and C.  How is RoLo going to help that?     And the Lakers are in LA not Minnesota, I'm pretty sure that if we had Love and Rubio on our roster we could have attracted stars. Compare the Lakers to Minnesota is just ridiculous in terms of FAs.   It's not the least bit ridiculous.  When people on here advocate for us signing guys like Rondo and and RoLo, they're asking for the same situation that made KLove want out of Minnesota - precious salary cap space eaten up by role players.  As it is, we're already regretting the Nick Young deal and he's only making $5 million/year.  We couldn't sign 2 max players this offseason without finding a way to get rid of him."
lakers,3buk4w,high5ghost,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:10:52 2015 UTC,"There are a bunch of solid sfs and cs left. Players like Lopez/Koufos or Brewer/Harris. They might not be all-stars, but they're definitely better than what we've got."
lakers,3buk4w,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:36:31 2015 UTC,"But (with the exception of Harris) they're not going to develop into anything more than what they already are.  If our guys develop into something - even if it's no better or worse than those guys, then they'll be worth more as tradeable assets than RoLo or Brewer."
lakers,3buk4w,high5ghost,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"Signing a good sf/c now doesn't hurt their development. Immediately starting rookies is always a good development strategy. If they come out the gates with added pressure of being a starter and struggle it could hinder their development. I'm not arguing that we shouldn't give the young guys major minutes, I'm just saying we need solid starters. We will sign a sf and c, I just don't want to end up scraping players from the bottom of the barrel."
lakers,3buk4w,StealthRUs,0,Thu Jul 2 16:29:39 2015 UTC,"Signing a good sf/c now doesn't hurt their development.   Yes, but it hurts the organization as a whole.  Any extra wins those guys help get us, hurts us.  We need to keep our picks."
lakers,3buk4w,Occitzer,4,Thu Jul 2 16:33:08 2015 UTC,"I think too many people (Kobe himself included) are in denial that Kobe is still a top 5 player and that he can lead a team to a title. The reality is that we can't be arrogant enough to assume that we can just sign players and give Kobe a chance to catch Jordan in rings. It sucks to lose obviously, but so far we've gotten Randle, Clarkson, and Russell because of it. Our targets shouldn't be aging max players like you said, but younger role players that will help us build a foundation. What Mitch should do next is try acquiring as many first round draft picks as possible while going after defensive role players; no more of these one and done deals that don't give fans anything to look forward to."
lakers,3buk4w,PatronSaintOfUpdog,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:19:25 2015 UTC,Good point. I would love to trade for some picks.
lakers,3buk4w,joeinthebox,5,Thu Jul 2 18:51:40 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with being patient as long as we're headed in the right direction. The problem is I have no idea what direction we're headed. The FO clearly isn't completely committed to young talent (as evident by the DMC trade rumors, but telling that they didn't go through with it), but not throwing a max at B level players like Harris or Monroe is a good sign. It shows we're still thinking about the future and getting the right fits, not just buying talent and wasting cap space. The league is embracing analytics, I have no idea where we stand on that (except that we're not at the top), we have an old school coach who doesn't like the weapon the two teams in the finals abuse when they play us (3pters), but we did draft Russell, and that seems like step in the right direction.  Also, I've said this a few times today. We were 53-29 when we signed Shaq. We just came off a 21-61 season. The fact that we're getting interest from guys like LMA or Deandre is incredible. If we literally doubled our wins next season, we still wouldn't be in the playoffs. If we tripled our wins, we still wouldn't be as good as the Warriors. I think these big name FA meetings are nothing more than formalities and building through young guys is the only way to actually get better FAs to come later. Meaning we need to win, and we need to hope Russell, Clarkson, Randle, etc are all as good as we hope they are. We have a top 3 protected pick next year, with any luck we'll keep it without being as bad as we were this year.  /speech"
lakers,3buk4w,StealthRUs,7,Thu Jul 2 07:28:55 2015 UTC,"The problem is I have no idea what direction we're headed.   I completely agree. I think that is why it is such a confusing time for not only the fans but the front office as well.  For the first time in a long time we have the blessing and the curse of having an open path ahead of us. It's a curse because it's hard to pin down exactly where we are going, however, I think it's a blessing because we have so much flexibility, so many more options.  What's that old saying about windows or doors? Something about one opening when another is closed or something like that. I think that applies to our situation:   Okafor or Russell? Didn't really matter to me. Either would be great. Trade the #2 pick for Cousins? Sure, if the Kings accepted the right deal, we work around Cousins. Don't trade the pick? Fine, we take a young talent like Okafor or Russell. We got Russell. Awesome. What next? OK, a player like LMA or DJ. If someone like LMA signs? Great. If not? Fine. We lean on our young guys and keep evolving from there.   I think the direction will be more clear to us once we start to see some paths start to close down.  It's hard to speculate what will happen one summer from now and then two summers from now when there are more marquee free agents available and when the salary caps significantly expand.  But -- no matter what happens this summer in free agency -- here's what I do know:   No more tanking.   It's becoming increasingly clear that free agents (especially marquee ones) are interested in joining a team that is read-made to win or at least have the perception of that.  Therefore, in 2015-16, we have to win as much as we can with whatever we have to show marquee free agents that we are a lot closer to success than they think. Then with a young core and a nice free agent or two? Well, then you start to see playoffs and once you're in there, anything can happen."
lakers,3buk4w,high5ghost,2,Thu Jul 2 08:54:07 2015 UTC,"If we're committing to developing Randle, Russell, Upshaw, and Clarkson, that means giving them lots of playing time, which means we are tanking, because starting 4/5 of your roster with rookies/near rookies will result in a lot of losses.   You can't have it both ways.  Either you want us to develop young guys - which means we are tanking, or you don't want us to tank and you want us to waste money on crap like Greg Monroe and Brandon Jennings."
lakers,3buk4w,StealthRUs,2,Thu Jul 2 14:10:00 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, tanking only became a thing around 2 or 3 seasons ago. Rebuilding can also be done other ways."
lakers,3buk4w,high5ghost,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:57:14 2015 UTC,"Under the new CBA, rebuilding is way more difficult if you don't  have any tradeable assets and don't lose a lot.  We could sign Greg Monroe and use him in a trade later, but if a contending team really wanted Greg Monroe, wouldn't they just find a way to sign him right now?  I don't understand why people think this way."
lakers,3buk4w,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:14:20 2015 UTC,"Because as we're seeing right now, players get signed up really fast. It not ridiculous to think that teams can't sign everyone they want to. Also if a team is making a playoff push and a certain player is not up to snuff that team may want to trade for a better player in the same position. We see it happen every year."
lakers,3buk4w,high5ghost,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:32:51 2015 UTC,"If the Spurs wanted Greg Monroe instead of LMA, he wouldn't be signed to the Bucks right now."
lakers,3buk4w,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:14:03 2015 UTC,"Ok, not really sure how that applies though...  I'm not talking about Max contract guys, I'm talking about mid-tier players, the guys with movable contracts."
lakers,3buk4w,high5ghost,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:33:02 2015 UTC,"If a contender was serious about signing any mid-tier guy, and that mid-tier guy wants to go to a contender, then they'll wait to see how the situation shakes out."
lakers,3buk4w,metrofeed,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:34:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, but their situation can change drastically during the season. Like when Wes Matthews got hurt this past season, the Blazers needing a good sg traded for Afflalo. In the 2014 FA period they wouldn't have even thought of signing him, but after Wes's injury their need for an sg changed."
lakers,3buk4w,NicDwolfwood,2,Thu Jul 2 16:40:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I was really hoping we would not trade for DMC.
lakers,3bviiz,GenerallyThere,4,Thu Jul 2 14:20:40 2015 UTC,"I really don't see a huge downside to signing him; even at the current max of $15m. I would be against it if the cap wasn't rising; but it is, and significantly so. $15m under the new cap for a guy with as a much potential as he has is a drop in the bucket."
lakers,3bviiz,Citizen_of_Atlantis,2,Thu Jul 2 15:24:38 2015 UTC,"If the Lakers wants to have a chance on signing Kevin Durant in 2016, what they need is a powerful versatile center/PF   But If they are not interested in KD, the best SF (aside from LeBron) is Tobias Harris."
lakers,3bviiz,moli7724,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:41:02 2015 UTC,He's really good already and only like 22 years old. I don't get why people don't see any all-star potential in this kid.
lakers,3bviiz,Sletts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:28:29 2015 UTC,"Tobias Harris is practically asking to be stolen from Orlando. 15 mill is the new 5 mill under the upcoming CBA. The comparisons to Nick young are not even fair. He isn't on the floor to showboat or to hoard attention but to play hard-nosed basketball. Has a lot of the Shawn Marion intangibles including hustle, spacing and lower body strength. He will be able to outdo everything Draymond Green does in two years."
lakers,3bviiz,swift_eklipz,0,Thu Jul 2 18:19:32 2015 UTC,"Pros: He is very young and would fit well with our core age wise and position wise. Cons: doesn't look like he is improving much year by year, not good defender, even rookie max is huge overpay, stat wise he is Nick Young with better rebounding, he is RFA with how this FA is going ORL has no reason not to match him and try to trade him later."
lakers,3bviiz,rejectx,4,Thu Jul 2 14:28:42 2015 UTC,"doesn't look like he is improving much year by year,   His 3-point shot improved dramatically last year.   And I would disagree with the Nick Young comparison.  Harris is way more efficient inside the arc than Young is.  But he is, supposedly, a ball stopper on offense like Young is.    I just don't think a guy that is just a decent upgrade to Nick Young is someone you throw $15 million/year at.  Yes, he's 7 years younger, but we don't know how much more he's going to improve, either, and we need guys that can actually defend."
lakers,3bviiz,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:45:13 2015 UTC,So you don't see his defensive game improving with age and maturity?
lakers,3bviiz,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:37:23 2015 UTC,"If he's not quick enough, age and maturity won't matter."
lakers,3bviiz,rejectx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:39:38 2015 UTC,"maybe, but I don't know if I want to commit ~16+ mil to him for 4 years (even with new cap) same with Monroe. We need defensive SF and C to compliment our core and not just scorers."
lakers,3bviiz,probotic,0,Thu Jul 2 14:41:41 2015 UTC,CON: We struck out on big names  PRO: We sign someone
lakers,3bviiz,StealthRUs,2,Thu Jul 2 14:24:09 2015 UTC,"Signing ""someone"" is not a pro.  It's a big-time con.  It's how teams get in trouble - making moves just to make moves."

These past 2 days have put the amount of dysfunction, delusion, and incompetence of ownership and management on full display for the world to see.  The Lakers are stuck in the past. I don't want to sit through a lengthy rebuilding process anymore than the next fan, but the Lakers simply don't have any building blocks in place to leap frog the lows they simply have to endure.  Problem is that they didn't target a Monta Ellis, or Tyson Chandler or the like that could help then right NOW. See you guys at next year's lottery."

lakers,3byvin,HellFireNT,7,Fri Jul 3 12:00:24 2015 UTC,Absolutely agree. The front office said they learned their lesson and wanted to be patient in a rebuilding situation. Instead they waste their time chasing a 30 year old they were never going to get and miss out out getting some quality mid range guys that would've helped build the team moving forward. Absolutely embarrassing.
lakers,3byvin,Trontaun79,3,Fri Jul 3 07:34:08 2015 UTC,"A lot of factors led to where we are now but the end fault is Jim buss ! Lakers used to get the best players because they could outbid anyone (now with the cap....) , we got screwed on the Chris Paul deal , the Kobe farewell contract , and so on ...

lakers,3byvin,yungJoc,3,Fri Jul 3 09:49:31 2015 UTC,"I just hope this embarrassment gets the Jim Buss apologists to see the light.

lakers,3byvin,Silky_Johnson24,6,Fri Jul 3 15:44:32 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed but not embarrassed. The Lakers have still made great moves these past years to rebuild with limited assets.  I guess Mitch has made the calculation that if there's a shot at a star player it's worth scrapping all other deals for.   I don't agree with that - Contracts for dudes like Afflalo, Rolo, and Demarre Carrol, ED DAVIS will be bargains for future.  But Mitch is swinging for the fences, and I can't totally fault him for doing so. If we get LMA that would be a home run (even though this current season would suck)."
lakers,3byvin,justsomeguy5,6,Fri Jul 3 07:46:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not embarrassed. The sports journalism today is a joke and is less about facts and more about narrative. Unknown sources will tell you that the Lakers are antiquated and that nobody wants to play with Kobe. Aldridge is the gem of this FA market but he's a 30 year old natural power forward, he's not a great fit beside our future star in Julius Randle. Plus we aren't a bonafide contender right now so the odds of us snagging him were slim. Therefore the out come of the meeting doesn't embarrass me at all.   Meanwhile he's refused to meet with the Knicks(do you see ESPN bashing that organizational as a result)? Only players on the Cavs radar are Mike Miller and Mo Williams..... Do you see ESPN claiming unknown sources that nobody wants to play with LeBron? No.   Critical thinking is important in this era. I still have faith in this Lakers organisation and by the time I lose faith Jim Buss will already be out the door, so I can have a new chance to renew my faith."
lakers,3byvin,HeJind,3,Fri Jul 3 12:42:43 2015 UTC,"The only fact that matters is that the Lakers approach to free agency is wrong. It's not a narrative constructed to make the Lakers appear incompetent when numerous star free agents have turned down the Lakers because they aren't in a position to win. That's not a matter of bad journalism.  That is what has happened for the past 2 years. Dwight, Carmelo, Chris Bosh, Deandre Jordan, and Lamarcus Aldridge. All max money players, and all have listened to the Lakers make their pitch, and all of them turned down the Lakers. Kevin Love also mentioned this before he got traded to the Cavs that the Lakers simply aren't an attractive destination because they aren't in a position to win.  So if critical thinking is so important, then why haven't you drawn the same conclusion? There's no need for the media to paint you a picture. Look at who the Lakers have met with, and who they have signed. The Lakers aren't attractive because they aren't winning. They want stars that are looking for championships, but have nothing to make them think they can win a championship right now playing for the Lakers.  It's no coincidence that almost everyone can see why the Lakers won't be any better this coming season. They allowed every mid-level free agent, and by that I mean free agents that could help the Lakers right now, that could be had for less than max money get signed by everyone else, and the Lakers are stuck in a holding pattern waiting for 2 people to decide, really just LMA, decide where they're going to sign. The Lakers had the opportunity to  really jump start their rebuild to a contender and blew it by targeting free agents they never had a chance to sign.  That's not a narrative. Those are facts."

Incompetence is when the Knicks gave Amar'e $120M and the Hawks gave Joe Johnson $120M after they whiffed on LeBron/Wade/Bosh.

It's going to be a rocky season, but you can develop your picks faster. The FO won't commit to long term contracts barring Nick Young and they'll play this game again in 2016.

lakers,3brl3g,Oracle343gspark,8,Wed Jul 1 18:12:02 2015 UTC,"as long as we're rebuilding from the bottom, I like Tyson Chandlerr here. He's a fun PnR big. He might be expensive though, and we'll probably end up overpaying him just for his size.  Other names include Bass, Monroe, Kanter, and Asik. The ones I didn't mention I didn't like. Obviously no homeruns out there. Chandlerr would be the funnest one out there though."
lakers,3brl3g,dendenmoooshi,9,Wed Jul 1 21:13:08 2015 UTC,He signed with the suns according to woj :(
lakers,3brl3g,capomic,3,Wed Jul 1 17:56:09 2015 UTC,"agreed...I lean towards Chandler and RoLo but I'd take Monroe as a last resort. Are we talking Brandon Bass? I thought he was always more of a 4....  I'm worried about our 3 though, if we can't steal a Middleton or Harris I don't know if we fill that in FA. Might have to make a trade, might have to give up assets."
lakers,3brl3g,DJQuik,3,Wed Jul 1 19:16:25 2015 UTC,"Yea, I dont know why I said Bass. He's definitely not a top option at center.  Tobias harris is a possibility since leaks have said magic aren't going to match a max offer. If we get no big names, I'm ok with Lakers paying max for his potential."
lakers,3brl3g,dendenmoooshi,2,Wed Jul 1 18:33:02 2015 UTC,"man i never believed we were getting a single of the guys you mentioned.  who do we move on to?   Tyson Chandler, Robin Lopez, Wes Matthews, Paul Pierce  that's as good as we're gonna get in FA. If possible we'll make trades to improve. That's where Mitch busts out the magic wand"
lakers,3brl3g,DJQuik,2,Wed Jul 1 19:14:04 2015 UTC,"Robin Lopez seems like a good pick up, Steve Nash and him were good pnr buddies so a good chance lopez and Russell can have the same connection."

lakers,3brl3g,IamKlutcH,-10,Wed Jul 1 20:32:09 2015 UTC,that last stupid Kobe deal torpedoed the lakers ability to grab big name FAs. the front office fucked up w that one. every other big star at kobe's age was taking a pay cut for his team to bring in youngsters. Kobe got greedy and the Lakers let him.
lakers,3brl3g,lordofallshit,14,Wed Jul 1 18:18:17 2015 UTC,"What.  The dude played for your team throughtout the length of his career, brought you 5 championships, and is the most recognized NBA player on the planet. You better do him a solid and send him off with a thanks for everything contract when it looks like you're entering a rebuilding period. You don't think other players in the league don't recognize this type of treatment?   And you goddamn well better be the first one reaching for a pen if you're Kobe. This is your last big NBA contract ever. Cash in.  I swear man, the horseshit you read on this subreddit sometimes."
lakers,3brl3g,JHeezy19,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:18:34 2015 UTC,Duncan brought SA 5 rings and you know what the difference is? Duncan is still playing for rings in the twilight of his career while Kobe is in the lotto. For a guy who supposedly put winning as the most important thing. Seems like $$$$ is king.
lakers,3brl3g,lordofallshit,6,Wed Jul 1 18:27:08 2015 UTC,"So? Is that somehow Kobe's fault? You gonna be that ignorant and naive to think money is not an issue? You really gonna sit there and pretend the CP3 trade didn't get denied, Steve Nash's body broke down, and Dwight bitched out?  The Spurs are probably the best in terms of management in all of professional sports. Literally no other teams come close in terms of their ability to stay competitive. So yeah, let's literally take the one outlier that trumps my argument and ignore the fact that the current champions had not even sniffed the Finals for 20 some odd years prior.  What an idiot."
lakers,3brl3g,JHeezy19,0,Wed Jul 1 19:51:02 2015 UTC,dirk took less too because he didnt wanna watch his team fall into the lotto.  even wade lebron and bosh took less to win
lakers,3brl3g,lordofallshit,5,Wed Jul 1 19:57:08 2015 UTC,And Dirk's team is still in first round purgatory. But good for him right?  Yeah the Heat thing happened. It was planned though. Who would the Lakers have signed if Kobe took less? The Lakers offered Dwight the max and he bounced to Houston leaving money on the table.  Got any more dumb examples?
lakers,3brl3g,JHeezy19,2,Wed Jul 1 20:00:39 2015 UTC,What free agent in the last couple years would of signed with us if Kobe didn't sign his contract?! It's crazy how selfish some Lakers fans are. This man gave us his all for 17 years and we knew the next couple years were going to get ugly after ths Nash and Dwight fiascos so why not give him the payday he deserves?!
lakers,3brl3g,KOpackBEmets,4,Wed Jul 1 20:09:24 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculous. Nash injuries and Dwight leaving after having traded our picks hurt us.   Nothing for free agents to come to. A year of Russell, Clarkson, and Randle showing promise will bring free agents back."
lakers,3brl3g,scurvy_durvy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:29:08 2015 UTC,Kobe made the right move. Look what happened to Wade. The Heat are paying GORAN DRAGIC more over 4 years than what Wade earned in 15  Speaking of Wade. I still wouldnt mind him coming over to LA. If we strike out I wouldnt mind paying him his 15 mil just to spite heat fans. He deserves it as a person and a player. Even if its another team rewarding him
lakers,3brl3g,ashishvp,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:30:28 2015 UTC,Lol at the hate but its true. We are pretty much paying Kobe for the past. Though most of his counterparts are taking cuts. At this point of his career Kobe is more into $$ than rings.
lakers,3brl3g,tree_D,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:07:15 2015 UTC,Who did we miss out on because of his contract? If anything I'd love to play for a team that I knew showed that kind of love to their stars when entering a rebuilding time period

I understand you're a fan but shit, you can't just expect to flash some trophies and have all the big names want to play for the Lakers. The FO were walking into an uphill battle to begin with."

lakers,3brl3g,p0se1d0n,0,Wed Jul 1 17:06:52 2015 UTC,"Sorry bruh, this arguement doesn't work anymore.  If a company wants to scoop up a player for endorsements, it's gonna happen regardless of where they live.

lakers,3brl3g,kittonmittonz,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"Dude, the Lakers are only allowed to offer 4.  Get your facts straight.  Portland is allowed to offer more years and more money.  That's built into the current collective bargaining agreement to give the incumbent team an advantage.  The 4yr/90 (assuming that number is right) is the max that the Lakers can offer, not a dollar more.  From wikipedia...   The maximum amount of money a player can sign for is based on the number of years that player has played and the total of the salary cap. The maximum salary of a player with 6 or fewer years of experience is either $9,000,000 or 25% of the total salary cap (2013–14: $14,670,000), whichever is greater. For a player with 7–9 years of experience, the maximum is $11,000,000 or 30% of the cap (2013–14: $17,603,700), and for a player with 10+ years of experience, the maximum is $14,000,000 or 35% of the cap (2013–2014: $20,537,650).[10] There is an exception to this rule: a player is able to sign a contract for 105% of his previous contract, even if the new contract is higher than the league limit.[11]  Designated Player Each team in the NBA can nominate a player on his rookie contract to receive a ""Designated Player"" contract extension. A Designated Player is eligible for a 5-year contract extension, instead of being held to the standard 4-year restriction.[6] A team can only allocate a single Designated Player contract at any one time (if a team has already extended a rookie contract by using the Designated Player extension they cannot create a second Designated Player contract until the current contract expires, or until the player moves to a different team); however the CBA rules do allow teams to sign a second Designated Player from another team in addition to the one they already have. All teams are limited to having a maximum of two Designated Players contracted on their roster at any time (one which they have created from one of their own rookie contracts, and one which they have acquired from another team).[12]"

lakers,3brl3g,SevTheNiceGuy,3,Wed Jul 1 17:04:11 2015 UTC,"Sixers fan here. You guys whiffing in free agency is the best thing to ever happen to your org since you drafted Kobe and signed Shaq. You guys were never going to be contenders this year and contrary to popular belief Byron Scott isnt actually a good coach. As some have pointed out, stars in the league can live in LA now without having to be on the lakers they all make too much money guys want to win. Russell was a great start and I know our team wanted him badly, not that I dislike Okafor he may turn out to be Duncan (at least on offense) but Russell is a special player. Start using analytics stop with the BS old laker mentality that got you where you are now and when the lakers show they've drafted some nice young pieces starting with Russell the teams everyone laughed at for tanking (us and you) will be winning 60 games playing in the finals in 3-4 years with cheap contracts."

lakers,3brl3g,apoliticalscientist,2,Wed Jul 1 21:16:48 2015 UTC,Im guessing the main deal breaker is his lack of desire to play the center position.  It would of been very difficult for us to bring in a center if we offered him the max.  We need to use our money this offseason on a young center.  DeAndre or Monroe look to be who we are targeting next.

lakers,3brl3g,tree_D,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:03:54 2015 UTC,Exactly. In today's league your franchise is only as good as it's current roster. These players don't care about living in LA. They can have houses there and live there in the offseason. Most of the season they are traveling anyway.
lakers,3brl3g,windmuffin,6,Wed Jul 1 17:07:41 2015 UTC,You don't spend 2 plus in hours in a meeting with a team that didn't impress you. Shelbourne said that meeting went great and is much better on the Lakers beat then Woj. I trust her on any Lakers news and Woj on everything else.   Edit. If Woj is in contact with LMA's agent then it's a good bet he wasn't as impressed as we had hoped. Until something is final though we won't know for sure.

Damian Lillard had more attempts in the paint than Lamarcus did last year. Lillard had 554 while LA had 539, and at least some of LA's attempts in the paint were put-backs from Lillard driving, right? Why do we want a 7 footer relying so heavily on a mid-range jumper? Go to the Spurs Lamarcus, you're a perfect fit."
lakers,3brl3g,tylerbird,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:50:07 2015 UTC,"The difference is that the spurs are better set up to bring him both short term and long term success.  Aldridge is 30 years old already so I doubt he would want to come to a rebuilding project.  Also Aldridge does not strike me as the kind of player who wants ""the world"" or to constantly be in the limelight the way he would be with the lakers.

We will also have more money left for a solid wing (if there's any left by the time we sign him).

They could even package some of those 1st round picks for an underrated player."
lakers,3buekh,TimeisIllmatic95,27,Thu Jul 2 07:01:02 2015 UTC,"Sixers fans feel the same way.  That's why they're not panicking. The team has a clear vision of what they want to do.  It's consistent and apparent with all their moves.  They've fully committed to a goal and are not half in/half out, unlike our FO.  We need to be making more moves like these."
lakers,3buekh,StealthRUs,13,Thu Jul 2 07:11:12 2015 UTC,I 100% agree. Just the fact Philly was able to trade MCW for a top 3 protected pick which they will obviously get was pretty amazing I must say.
lakers,3buekh,TimeisIllmatic95,-4,Thu Jul 2 07:27:07 2015 UTC,"Depending on how committed the Lakers are, the Sixers might not get that pick.  We're going to be a lot less experienced team if all we do is just keep Wes Johnson and Ed Davis.  Randle will be starting in place of Boozer and Russell will be starting in place of Lin.  We could easily tank into the bottom 3.  Kobe couldn't screw up by winning with a team starting Randle, Russell, Upshaw, and Johnson/McDaniels."
lakers,3buekh,StealthRUs,4,Thu Jul 2 13:51:35 2015 UTC,"Highly doubt Wes Johnson will be back for a third yr, but I guess there's a chance we could keep the pick IDK. We have to see how things play out later tonight after the LMA meeting."

lakers,3buekh,faithfamilyfootball,11,Fri Jul 3 03:41:21 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we made a lot of moves straight out of Hinkie's playbook over the last year. The team seems self aware of the changing NBA and seems willing to adapt.   For example:    Absorbing Lin's contract for a 1st round pick (this was a rumored Sixers-Rockets trade and we made a deal with the Rockets out of nowhere) Aggressively benching Lin to prioritize the development of Clarkson (it worked) Not giving bloated contracts to mediocre players that were rumored to be interested in us (Bledsoe, Lance Stephenson, etc) Good minimum and late draft acquisitions that didn't cost us assets (Clarkson, Tariq Black) Didn't waste assets on role players (for example, Minnesota traded 2 first round picks for Thad Young and Adreian Payne)"
lakers,3buekh,joebooty,9,Thu Jul 2 07:33:28 2015 UTC,The Sixers ownership group somehow bought the team for only 280M 4 years ago. It is still not clear exactly how that happened but what an amazing bargain.   The end result is an ownership group that has doubled its money in 4 years without having to field a great team (lol understatement) so they are willing to be patient. It is really a fairly unique situation.

lakers,3buekh,StealthRUs,5,Thu Jul 2 23:52:50 2015 UTC,We should've done that deal.   Really good move on Hinkie's part. Maybe we can still get a 1st rounder for Boston dumping Gerald Wallace on us.

How could you have absorbed the 13.5mil in contracts this year and the 14ish mil in contracts next year for Landry and Thompson?

lakers,3buekh,yungJoc,-7,Thu Jul 2 06:16:08 2015 UTC,Part of me likes the deal but part of me wants to get some useful free agents this year.  76ers did it too because the draft is basically their only choice now: nobody wants to go there.  I don't wanna become the 76ers of the western conf.
lakers,3buekh,StealthRUs,14,Thu Jul 2 06:19:18 2015 UTC,"The draft is our only choice now.  You may not want to be 76ers west,  but we're already there."
lakers,3buekh,p321p,9,Thu Jul 2 06:22:07 2015 UTC,Honestly. Drafting players seems like the way to rn. We couldn't land LA who's the best FA that was linked to us.   Might as well stockpile future assets and hope Nik can develop to a rotation player. Thompson and Landry could be serviceable bigs for a year. Keep rounding out the team with proven talent and hope for the best when fa comes around again.
lakers,3buekh,Cienes,8,Thu Jul 2 06:27:43 2015 UTC,"It's not a bad thing at all. I think it's just a matter of when we can accept it.   With the current CBA, any superstar player will be locked in to the team that drafted him for 9 years. Obviously, we'll have the opportunity to try to lure a lot of players after their 9th years - but even in those scenarios we are missing out on some of the players most productive (and best value) years from 5-9. Not to mention the player development and the organic building of a roster around the superstar's strengths and weaknesses."
lakers,3buekh,StealthRUs,-2,Thu Jul 2 07:22:56 2015 UTC,"No, it isn't. Right now, I don't think they have a concrete plan of who they need to win, and how they're going to win. Too much uncertainty, and not enough ""Here's what we're going to do to put you in a position to succeed."""
lakers,3buekh,justbringitbitch,2,Thu Jul 2 06:33:21 2015 UTC,They went after LMA and tried to go after KLove this year.  They tried to go after LeBron and Carmelo last year.  They are targeting the guys they need to win.  They just don't have the assets to surround those guys with.  Robin Lopez and Rajon Rondo are not those guys.
lakers,3buekh,StealthRUs,0,Thu Jul 2 06:48:47 2015 UTC,I'll be happy if this cap clearing trade yields them nothing in free agency. That way we can revisit a Cousins trade. Doing this actually helps facilitate a trade that gives them back multiple players and salary.
lakers,3buekh,badguymatt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:15:19 2015 UTC,"If we do a Cousins trade, we shouldn't do it until halfway through the season once we see what we have.  Maybe Randle will perform well enough that they'll do the deal without getting Russell as well."
lakers,3buekh,StealthRUs,-1,Thu Jul 2 13:52:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that they'd do it simply because of the fact that we don't own our first round pick next season. Therefore we can't trade it. However, if you took out the swap of the 2016 first rounder completely, I'm sure they'd do it. Though that doesn't really solve much other than us hoping they're worse than us in 2017."
lakers,3buekh,badguymatt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:23:28 2015 UTC,I'm not sure that they'd do it simply because of the fact that we don't own our first round pick next season.    We do own our first pick if we land in the top 3.
lakers,3buekh,Cienes,3,Thu Jul 2 14:16:23 2015 UTC,"We don't actually own our pick in the sense that we cannot trade our pick. Philly can trade our pick. In fact, it was traded to them (as you know.) but we could not trade our 2016 first round pick right now. We can trade it on draft night if we happen to fall into the top-3, sure. But that would mean we own our pick."

lakers,3bu3mh,nigg_a,2,Thu Jul 2 15:27:27 2015 UTC,The Lakers had won 53 games the year before and had a championship contending team. Shaq was not coming to a barren squad and starting over the way LMA would be doing now. Shaq was doing something more akin to if LMA went to the Spurs right now.   Players don't want to go to crap teams. They want to go to good teams. Shaq included.

lakers,3bu3mh,DUBBZZ,0,Thu Jul 2 17:55:14 2015 UTC,True but it would be nice to get some decent young talent now. Tobias has some serious Ced Ceballos potential. I even think their games are a bit similar
lakers,3bu3mh,lakerfan91,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:57:01 2015 UTC,Agreed. We need to build a solid core in order to attract a superstar caliber FA. Harris is young and can contribute immediately.  Get a few solid veterans and we'll be back in business
lakers,3bu3mh,randy88moss,3,Thu Jul 2 13:09:35 2015 UTC,"This here is what gives me hope. Even if big name FA's don't want to come here, look at the success the team has had through the draft and on the trading block."
lakers,3bu3mh,lalo_92,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:09:27 2015 UTC,That said I'd sure like to see them pick up Robin Lopez and or Tobias just to have some more pieces
lakers,3bu3mh,supremesamurai,2,Thu Jul 2 04:13:09 2015 UTC,Metta was a HUGE FA signing.
lakers,3bu3mh,kushalKD,2,Thu Jul 2 04:14:05 2015 UTC,Well there's one I did forget. Long run keeping Ariza would have been preferable but I'll always defend Artest after that game 7 vs Celtics
lakers,3bu3mh,chargerland,2,Thu Jul 2 04:17:58 2015 UTC,That three!! I remember screaming no wtf then jumping up and down when it swished in.

lakers,3bu3mh,Inexh,0,Thu Jul 2 05:11:16 2015 UTC,"Its not a matter of caring so much as if you ask any average fan they will say the Lakers always get all the star free agents. Its an implication that the system is rigged in their favor. I've been hearing this for years and years and it gets annoying. I do understand some guys force their way to LA via trade, Kareem and Kobe come to mind, but this fallacy that the Lakers can just sign whoever they want because they always have needs to be put to rest."
lakers,3bu3mh,rsong965,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:07:30 2015 UTC,Yup and you can use this offseason has an example. Lol.
lakers,3bvw50,iJIP,2,Thu Jul 2 16:07:46 2015 UTC,"I'd like us to sign Ed Davis to a multi year deal, Lin is going to get a decent offer elsewhere, and I could care less if we sign wesley or not"
lakers,3bvw50,Itorr475,2,Thu Jul 2 16:29:34 2015 UTC,"Lin: Probably joining some other team. Quite a number of teams are linked to him including DAL, SAS, MEM, IND  Johnson: Reports said that he was meeting with Doc Rivers, probably off to LAC.  Boozer: We have too much depth at PF. Wouldn't be signing him back.  Ellington: NYK & GSW has expressed interest in him. Not sure where he is heading for though."
lakers,3bvu5p,viper25,2,Thu Jul 2 15:52:22 2015 UTC,"@ramonashelburne: If Lakers miss on their top three FA targets, they're more likely to pursue David Lee in a trade than revisit Boogie talks  https://twitter.com/ramonashelburne/status/616670029485076480"
lakers,3bvu5p,nauticalsky,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:23:43 2015 UTC,Not yet.
lakers,3bvu5p,probotic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"I'm curious what they'd give up for us or anyone to take on Lee's contract.  They don't have many draft picks left, and any second rounders will be towards the end of the draft and not too valuable anyways.  It would be awesome if they give up Looney, but would they really give him and Lee to a division rival?  I think dumping Lee on New York makes more sense for them"
lakers,3bvu5p,_im_on_acid_,0,Thu Jul 2 16:20:31 2015 UTC,Probably Looney and maybe a future pick or a role player. They were trying to ship Lee plus the #30 pick before draft night according to reports.
lakers,3bvu5p,erehpzomta,0,Thu Jul 2 17:02:13 2015 UTC,If he came with two first round picks from GSW and maybe B Rush I think we should take him ._.
lakers,3bvu5p,TheAsianMamba,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:02:06 2015 UTC,We are scraping from the bottom of the FA barrel at this point. David Lee is looking great right now haha. If we get anything but Lee I will be very ecstatic
lakers,3bvu5p,javi2123,0,Thu Jul 2 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"Thrown in Looney, some 2nd rounders and I'll be cool with Lakers allowing 160 points a game next year"
lakers,3bvu5p,PaulKr,0,Thu Jul 2 16:03:15 2015 UTC,"Why?  Why do we have to sign just any guy out there?  We already have Randle starting for us at the 4, Ed Davis is a 4/5, and we drafted Nance Jr. who plays the 4 as well.  Why do we need David Lee?"
lakers,3bvu5p,StealthRUs,2,Thu Jul 2 16:18:19 2015 UTC,"Assets, Assets, Assets."
lakers,3bvu5p,Count_Sack_McGee,-2,Thu Jul 2 16:29:53 2015 UTC,"If David Lee was such an asset to a contending team, a contending team would sign him already.  Christ, I hate how people keep repeating this retarded mantra on here.  Assets = young, developing players on cheap deals and draft picks.  David Lee is not an asset, and he could fuck up the tank."
lakers,3bvu5p,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"No one can sign Lee, he's under contract next year.  He'd be a salary dump similar to Lin last year that would require the Warriors to give up something for another team to pay his $15mil.  The question is what they'd give up and if it's worth it."
lakers,3bvu5p,_im_on_acid_,0,Thu Jul 2 16:40:23 2015 UTC,Ah.  Ok.  I'm cool with them dumping Lee on us for picks only if it's picks from other teams.  Their picks aren't going to be worth much of anything.
lakers,3bvu5p,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:46:37 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  The problem is they don't own any picks from other teams, all of their second round picks are traded until 2019, and they owe Utah their first round pick next year so they can't trade any first round picks until 2019 either.    They might have to give up Kevon Looney to dump David Lee, I'd be cool picking up Looney, let him get healthy and then we add another young piece.  If they have to give Looney up they'd probably look to the Knicks first rather than give a division rival a good young player."
lakers,3bvu5p,_im_on_acid_,0,Thu Jul 2 17:36:38 2015 UTC,I'd do it if they send Looney in the deal. Problem is the Sixers are out there too and might do it for less.
lakers,3bwmve,molson24,2,Thu Jul 2 19:28:54 2015 UTC,"Lol, its not so easy. You have to draft right, make the right trades, have at least 1 or 2 FA's sign with you. We don't have much right now to work with."
lakers,3bwmve,jasoyang,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:29:47 2015 UTC,"the ""have at least 1 or 2 FA's sign with you"" part is what we are failing at currently."
lakers,3bwmve,spudwinkle,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:34:08 2015 UTC,And this is assuming our rookies develop into all stars which honestly has less of a chance than both of them busting
lakers,3bwmve,duragjones,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"Randle and Russell are future all-stars, so hold up your predictions, we'll see."

lakers,3bwmve,WOX_69,2,Thu Jul 2 19:35:33 2015 UTC,Lmao that's your silver lining man.!?? Utter disappointment if anything we should've been overpaying decent free agents since last year
lakers,3bwmve,duragjones,-1,Thu Jul 2 19:37:21 2015 UTC,Thats what I was so upset about after last offseason. We should have gone after I. Thomas or even offered greg monroe last year.
lakers,3bwmve,pistolpete4407,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:41:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly, it infuriates me how Mitch tries to act like there's nothing wrong"
lakers,3bwmve,duragjones,2,Thu Jul 2 19:44:00 2015 UTC,You'd rather our GM have a public breakdown?
lakers,3brot2,lakerswiz,15,Wed Jul 1 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"Even before the FA period started, I didn't think the Lakers would land any of the ""marquee"" names.  My guess is that Lakers strike out and then use cap space on a placeholder to be able to try again next offseason.  One deal that I could see happening is swallowing David Lee's final year ($15-16M or something) if the Ws sweeten the deal with picks and maybe a player.  Lee and Kobe will then be off the books next summer to try again."
lakers,3brot2,hoverbikes,8,Wed Jul 1 17:38:15 2015 UTC,"This would be a very shrewd move, D.Lee is still a quality player and if we could get a first rounder or something out of it I'd be all for it. D.Lee might be a good influence on Randle as well."
lakers,3brot2,lufty574,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:18:32 2015 UTC,I'm just afraid that it's going to be another Boozer situation again. We aren't going to be giving Randle minutes because Scott is going to want to start a veteran over developing a rookie.
lakers,3brot2,PaperDesk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:28:30 2015 UTC,"I'd be okay with BS starting a former all-star and champion over (essentially) a rookie. Still, I'd like to see Randle get at least 20 min a game this season, ideally 25+."
lakers,3brot2,lufty574,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:11:23 2015 UTC,"I don't see any reason to start Lee if we are only going to win 30 games any way next year. The best way to develop talent is by giving them minutes and freedom in the court. We might as well be giving Randle, Russell, and Clarkson all starting minutes so maybe one of them can develop into an all star."
lakers,3brot2,PaperDesk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:45:19 2015 UTC,Hadn't thought about it but i would be very happy with a year of David Lee. I think when the Boogie rumours started going around a few people got overly attached to the idea of the Lakers making it into real contention this year and forgot we've got a really good rebuild already underway
lakers,3brot2,Ksanti,10,Wed Jul 1 23:39:05 2015 UTC,I'm hoping we land Monroe and Tobias. That seems more realistic and frankly better. That would be a nice youth movement and put us in the right direction.
lakers,3brot2,polvitos,2,Wed Jul 1 17:24:05 2015 UTC,Can we afford both? That wouldn't be such a bad off season.
lakers,3brot2,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:42:03 2015 UTC,Nope.
lakers,3brot2,virji24,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:43:34 2015 UTC,We would have to clear some space and hope each would take a little less
lakers,3brot2,lars5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:29:57 2015 UTC,Nope we'd need like $30M.
lakers,3brot2,polvitos,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:05:58 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. If one player takes a 1 year option then signs for more the following season under the cap. And we're still clearing cap room.   We could also do a sign and trade with one of them.
lakers,3brot2,lars5,5,Wed Jul 1 18:54:10 2015 UTC,"you're asking a decent player to take a steep pay cut. And looking at what guys are signing for today, it'll be really steep."
lakers,3brot2,ThomasFurke,9,Wed Jul 1 19:10:59 2015 UTC,"30 teams, only a few top FAs that weren't staying with their team, we're not a contender. No shocker if we strike out."
lakers,3brot2,harleq01,10,Wed Jul 1 16:43:19 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, Honestly I'd rather give our young guys more play time and ball time anyway. We're not going to change our chances at winning by just adding DJ or LMA."
lakers,3brot2,Terry_Pandee,38,Wed Jul 1 16:49:37 2015 UTC,At this point I think we need one of these rookies to become a star so quality free agents don't look at us as building from the ground up. Either that or one big FA has to take the plunge and others will follow. Not looking good this off season though.
lakers,3brot2,MChammershammer,23,Wed Jul 1 16:40:13 2015 UTC,We have essentially 4/5 potential rookies that will be on the roster.  We were never a good fit for Deandre or Aldridge.  I don't even know why people thought we were.  This season is strictly building our players and giving them exposure.
lakers,3brot2,Terry_Pandee,9,Wed Jul 1 16:43:29 2015 UTC,"I don't even know why people thought we were.   I hate this kind of thinking. Shit goes awry so people start acting like 'oh this wasn't supposed to happen in the first place.' It's a coping mechanism. We had cap space, we made a pitch and if LMA chose to go elsewhere, we failed to lure him here. It's a failure that we couldn't get him to play here."
lakers,3brot2,MChammershammer,20,Wed Jul 1 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"I disagree with it being a coping mechanism.  I believe we swing for all FAs as long as we have the cap space.  You have to be realistic here, this is not where shit goes awry.  There is a max contract in San Antonio to play along side Leonard, Duncan, Green, Parker, and Ginobili.  Why would he chose us, regardless of how nice our weather is, or how storied the Lakers are?  I believe it is more important to be realistic is all.  There was ZERO chance we were getting Aldridge if the Spurs cleared the space."
lakers,3brot2,TheChipiboy,2,Wed Jul 1 16:52:40 2015 UTC,"To add to that, i also think that the FA we were targeting were too old. These guys like Melo (last year) LMA and Marc all want to win. They dont want to be in a rebuild, but actual contention for a championship. The only guy i saw that had the chance was Kevin Love, but that was last year when he was up in the air."
lakers,3brot2,StealthRUs,4,Thu Jul 2 08:19:13 2015 UTC,Cap space was the only thing we had.  LMA is in his 30s.  There are plenty of other teams with cap space also that could give him a much better shot at winning a ring.  Serious question - what did we have to offer him that Portland didn't?
lakers,3brot2,stevebeyten,4,Wed Jul 1 18:54:46 2015 UTC,"I mean... some of us legit thought LMA was a longshot and a bad fit before we even met with him so I'm not sure why you're categorizing it as a ""coping mechanism""..."
lakers,3brot2,virji24,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:56:16 2015 UTC,"Really? Bc it seems to me like it was a long shot considering LA repeatedly has said 2 things. He wants no part of playing the center position, and he wants to go to a title contender. Am I missing where we can offer him either of those things?"
lakers,3brot2,justgivingsomeadvice,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:27:09 2015 UTC,"I mean if anything I think we keep a good amount of the cap space we have and go into next off season with enough to sign two max free agents. I haven't done the math, but I'm sure it will be possible."
lakers,3brot2,manolo88,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:41:20 2015 UTC,With just a bunch of rookie deals (and Nick Young) on the books? I see no reason why we wouldn't be able to sign 2+ maxes. Would've been nice to get a discount max on this year's cap though
lakers,3brot2,Citizen_of_Atlantis,5,Wed Jul 1 18:31:17 2015 UTC,"I'm expecting to strike out on all the top free agents. But I really hope we sign some tier-2 free agents. I would love to sign Tobias Harris, especially since Orlando seems to be signing Trillsap. Harris is the RFA that I think wont be returning to the magic and he's only 22.  If we sign Robin Lopez or Chandler as well, we would have a pretty decent team. It won't make the playoffs, but we have to be patient."
lakers,3brot2,BicMitchum_,3,Wed Jul 1 17:23:00 2015 UTC,"I still think we could get Tobias. I mean it's a gamble to offer max, or near-max, money on a guy like that. He's been pretty consistent in his career but if we give him a big contract and his production tails off then we're be saddled with a bad contract for some key years in our rebuild that may tie our hands for some future signings.   I think it may be worth it though just because the cap is rising so much that if we gave him max now it wouldn't be the end of the world moving forward. If we strike out on LMA and DJ, then that's the route I'd probably take."
lakers,3brot2,UrbanRaptor,3,Wed Jul 1 17:21:03 2015 UTC,I had a feeling we would. It doesn't make any sense why any of these FA's would come to a younger rebuilding lakers team.
lakers,3brot2,showtimeb,3,Wed Jul 1 18:26:30 2015 UTC,Oh God is this sub going to be filled with panic and how we should tank this upcoming season if we strike out on FAs again?
lakers,3brot2,Side-Pocket,0,Wed Jul 1 18:56:24 2015 UTC,we should tank. Lakers aren't gonna be doing anything. Why sign anyone mediocre to be at sub 40 wins and give up our pick? Just tank and hope for the 3rd pick or higher and continue the rebuild when kobe retires.
lakers,3brot2,showtimeb,2,Wed Jul 1 19:27:27 2015 UTC,Doesn't the Sixers get our pick if we tank next year?
lakers,3brot2,darkshark21,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:14:28 2015 UTC,Its top 3 protected
lakers,3brot2,showtimeb,2,Wed Jul 1 20:18:03 2015 UTC,A top 3 pick isn't guaranteed if you have a bottom 3 record.
lakers,3brot2,ashishvp,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:53:09 2015 UTC,yeah but its better to go for that chance than to be mediocre and get nothing. Either way nothing happens for the lakers until kobe retires. Might as well take the chance to get future assets. If we tank and end up not getting a top 3 pick we don't really end up any worse off
lakers,3brot2,showtimeb,0,Wed Jul 1 22:00:05 2015 UTC,"A top 3 protected pick? lol  Why would you have the tank mindset before the season starts. The team is gonna take the season day by day. If they keep winning games, nothing is stopping them from a playoff run."
lakers,3brot2,ashishvp,3,Wed Jul 1 22:13:13 2015 UTC,if you think this laker team will make a playoff run in the west you're delusional
lakers,3brot2,showtimeb,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:37:01 2015 UTC,"It's not about being delusional. It's taking the season game by game.   I'm saying the only thing stopping us from a playoff run is winning. We have no idea how good our rookies are. If they win, they win."
lakers,3brot2,_Wi11,2,Wed Jul 1 22:41:10 2015 UTC,"LOL you're trivializing the road to the playoffs so much. ""The only thing stopping us from a playoff run is winning"" When there are so many factors stopping us from winning. We have to have a top 8 record in the west. I'm just being a realist man there is absolutely no way the lakers are even a .500 team next year and if thats the case I'd rather we put ourselves in a position to contribute to our future by tanking. In today's league if you are not a contender than its always better to be bottom of the pack, mediocrity is a huge detriment to the future of a franchise"
lakers,3brot2,dharasick,7,Wed Jul 1 22:54:00 2015 UTC,I don't care as long as we land Tyson Chandler. He's great for us.
lakers,3brot2,SpaceCowboy170,15,Wed Jul 1 17:00:43 2015 UTC,Just signed to Phoenix
lakers,3brot2,SpaceCowboy170,4,Wed Jul 1 19:14:52 2015 UTC,"That would require the mavs getting DJ and the Bucks passing on Tyson, and then it's kind of a crapshoot as to who gets him"
lakers,3brot2,xodus112,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:28:45 2015 UTC,Why would that require the both of those?  They're already saying Milwaukee is out of the picture and DJ could sign in Singapore and it shouldn't affect us.
lakers,3brot2,JHeezy19,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:49:36 2015 UTC,"If I could get a source on the Bucks being a non-factor, that'd be awesome news for us.  Last I heard Milwaukee was the biggest possibility, but he could just re-sign if Dallas doesn't get Jordan."
lakers,3brot2,StealthRUs,2,Wed Jul 1 19:13:13 2015 UTC,Well he just signed with the suns.
lakers,3brot2,bombchron,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:18:10 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for Chandler, too. I really wanted LMA, but that was a long shot."
lakers,3brot2,Thidwicks_Ultimatum,6,Wed Jul 1 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"I really don't get why people on this subreddit are so desperate to see the Lakers ""hit a home run"" on FA every summer. It's like people expect that the Lakers will make an instant title run or something if we happen to land the biggest name every year.  LMA was a longshot to begin with. Yeah, it would have been awesome. No, it would not have made the team a force in the West. He's not getting any younger and the Spurs are pretty much a perfect situation for him.  DJ is a waste of money unless he actually takes the time to work on his game. Period. Watch his career plummet if he chooses to leave CP3 and Doc.  Greg Monroe is ass. He's got a strong post game and good rebounding ability, but he's a huge liability on defense. He's the exact opposite of DJ. No thanks.  Marc Gasol. You really think he'd consider it with the way Pau was treated the last few years in LA? Never had a shot.  Jimmy Butler. I love this guy but Chicago's got the death grip on him. Depending on how things pan out, there's always next summer.  Kevin Love. Would you really leave playing with LeBron and Kyrie in the East? Especially after seeing first-hand what LeBron was doing in the Finals? Who gives a shit if you're in Cleveland for 6 months outta the year? You're playing with a dude dropping videogame numbers every night.  Didn't name others because they're just smaller pieces of the puzzle.  So what's so damn enticing about this years FA's? Nobody is making the Lakers instant contendors, hell it won't even be a guarantee to make it to the 8th slot. If anything I wouldn't mind watching the younger guys on the roster this season. There's finally some fucking youth in the Lakers. Let them play and then bring what missing pieces you need."
lakers,3brot2,showtimeb,3,Wed Jul 1 18:46:56 2015 UTC,Truth.
lakers,3brot2,SpaceCowboy170,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:19:08 2015 UTC,"Bingo. For the last several months I've felt Tobias should be our one big target this offseason. He is just the type of player we need at this point, young, not marquee, and very productive."
lakers,3brot2,Thidwicks_Ultimatum,0,Wed Jul 1 21:14:43 2015 UTC,"This. Id so much rather sit tight on this promising crop of young talent, then shoot their load prematurely and either trade away some of these high ceiling pieces, or handcuff ourselves from the next two years of free agents. Have patience people... we basically just hit home runs in the draft the last two seasons, and we need to let these guys grow and develop. The future is still bright, and this team will actually be fun to watch gel."
lakers,3brot2,ss3happy1,5,Wed Jul 1 21:13:14 2015 UTC,"TBH I'm in the same boat as you. I don't think lakers will sign any really good FA talent until Kobe has officially retired. And as much as I love Kobe, the Lakers will be shit until he is off the team just the reality of it."
lakers,3brot2,DA40_in_the_rough,2,Wed Jul 1 16:48:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest, assuming we don't get LMA/DeAndre/Love, even though it would be a ""strike out"" and we probably won't be much better next year I'm not upset really. I have doubts about LMA's worth to the Lakers, being 30 and all. DeAndre also doesn't really do it for me. Both seem like a waste of cap space when we could have something much better next year (KD, Westbrook, etc.) And neither DeAndre or Aldridge would put us over the edge unless we got another superstar or Randle Russell or Clarkson grow up ridiculously quick.   Just my 2 cents."
lakers,3brot2,StealthRUs,2,Wed Jul 1 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"Best case scenario is we get Monroe and Harris, and i'm not sure how likely that is.  If Dj is a maverick and LMA is a spur, we'd better hope we don't miss on those two.  Otherwise we're looking at a lineup of Russell/Bryant/Young/Randle/Black and another year of waiting"
lakers,3brot2,RudiLogic,3,Wed Jul 1 17:26:40 2015 UTC,Young will not be starting...
lakers,3brot2,Lyqu1d,2,Wed Jul 1 21:09:44 2015 UTC,"No, it's vital we land at least some guy on a long term deal this summer, to take advantage of their deflating salary with the new cap increase - otherwise, it will be hard to sign two max contract guys in the future because both will be under the new CBA, and each will kill the cap. So please, don't stop praying laker nation!"
lakers,3brot2,RudiLogic,2,Wed Jul 1 17:27:06 2015 UTC,"I hope we do strike out.  Let's be real, LMA is 30 and DJ has too many holes for a max guy.  It might be a mistake to max them.  I would much rather go aggressively after the 2016 and 2017 free agent classes."

lakers,3brot2,StealthRUs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:03:24 2015 UTC,Newest report is LA's camp is denying the reports and Lakers are still in contention.  That said I honestly wouldn't mind signing Tobias Harris and Greg Monroe. That gives us a solid player going into the future at all 5 positions and if we can keep Ed Davis we have a decent 6 player core going into the future (granted they all develop well)  + 1 superstar sign potential next season.  And if we get Lamarcus I can't really imagining things going anywhere but up.
lakers,3brot2,KookLife,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:41:33 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think LA is gonna sign with us. I do however believe in the strength of our core and I believe that Harris and Greg would both be solid adds to the team. I just wanna see our boys developing under the wings of Kobe. We're gonna be a severe threat on the West in the next 2 years, believe me."
lakers,3brot2,droid0mega,2,Thu Jul 2 13:32:39 2015 UTC,"Big free agents were never going to sign with us, no matter the offer. Who would join a team in full rebuild instead of a playoff/championship contender? We can only hope the young guys put up a good show this season and Kobe stays healthy, then maybe we can hope to attract some big name in 2016."
lakers,3brot2,swaggerqueen16,2,Wed Jul 1 18:36:02 2015 UTC,"If we get Greg Monroe I won't be devastated. His shot charts have been comparable to Pau's these last few years. He's 6""11 and offensively talented.   The thing that I'm thinking is if we build a team that's all offense and no defense, and keep losing. Maybe it'll force our guys to just become better defenders. They're all pretty young. What's to stop them from figuring it out and growing that way. Most guys are asked to keep growing on offense.   I think it'd really help if we signed one really defensive guy. If we got Monroe and Tyson Chandler I'd be pretty excited."
lakers,3brot2,droid0mega,2,Wed Jul 1 18:47:34 2015 UTC,Yes.  But then I get downvoted because everyone thinks I'm being too negative.   We just need to commit to the rebuild and stop trying to take shortcuts.
lakers,3brot2,StealthRUs,2,Wed Jul 1 18:53:22 2015 UTC,"If we hand Philly a #4 pick next year I'm going to lose it. If we don't add any solid players, we might end up as bad or worse than last year."
lakers,3brot2,jitatime,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:13:46 2015 UTC,Anyone believe this has something to do with not wanting to play with Kobe?
lakers,3brot2,Cienes,4,Wed Jul 1 16:41:21 2015 UTC,Not in any way.
lakers,3brot2,ohhlookathat,8,Wed Jul 1 17:42:34 2015 UTC,Hell no. It's more like kobes contact doesn't give us incredible room until next year
lakers,3brot2,kingtarzan,-1,Wed Jul 1 16:42:52 2015 UTC,Hmm what about now? Still defending Kobe?
lakers,3brot2,StealthRUs,3,Wed Jul 1 21:06:30 2015 UTC,No.  It has to do with us being a terrible team and top-tier guys not wanting to come to a rebuilding project.   We just have to be patient and let our young guys show that they're worth playing with or they develop well enough to be attractive enough trade bait to get a guy that guys will want to play with.
lakers,3brot2,toomanypumpfakes,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:00:43 2015 UTC,"Its about money, and Kobe just takes up alot of it. Even if he is out after next season, no one wants to ""waste"" a year if they want to contend."
lakers,3brot2,avatar2534,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:24:17 2015 UTC,Think it has more to do with coming off of a franchise-worst season.

lakers,3brot2,InstantNoodlesIsHot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:44:37 2015 UTC,Robin Lopez and tobias gives us a young solid core to be competitive and stay flexible with tradeable assets for the next year fa class.
lakers,3brot2,TimeisIllmatic95,2,Wed Jul 1 17:49:30 2015 UTC,We won't be competitive with those 2 guys.  They are not difference makers.  We'll still be terrible.  We will only start to be competitive if/when Randle and Russell develop to the potential that some predict for them.
lakers,3brot2,LowkeyAnushole,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:15:31 2015 UTC,"It never made any sense to get Aldridge. He's 30 and all our guys are young as fuck, never got why he'd want to come here. DeAndre I'd love but I can't see him defecting from the Clippers to the Lakers.  Monroe I wouldn't be mad about getting but wouldn't be super pumped either. I'd like to get someone young and versatile like Harris, that'd be cool."
lakers,3brot2,SPMrFantastic,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:11:49 2015 UTC,"Fuck it, all the good young prospects are gone.  Let's just sign Wade and Pierce to 1+1's for the lulz"
lakers,3brot2,SSD65,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:13:57 2015 UTC,"feel same, except i really though we would get dmc for a while there.  only thing to do is build our rookies and hope one or more becomes a star.  money and the los angeles ""market"" are just not enough anymore since guys can become stars pretty much anywhere nowadays."
lakers,3brot2,manonthemoon14,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:20:00 2015 UTC,"I think this season we should focus on getting a defensive center like Chandler/Lopez/Hibbert. I think if Aldridge came it would mean less playing time for Randle or Aldridge playing center, which he doesn't want to do. Would be nice to land Aldridge, but it seems like the Lakers and him might want different things."
lakers,3brot2,tree_D,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:29:04 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are mentioning Monroe, but I'm not even sure if the Lakers should get him. We shouldn't sign players just for the sake of signing. If we could get Tobias Harris at this point, that would be cool. At least w/ him he can score and he's only 23 so he has the potential to improve on the defensive end."
lakers,3brot2,pr0ton13,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:41:41 2015 UTC,All?  Or the one?  I think them meeting with DJ and Monroe is just them doing their due diligence.
lakers,3brot2,scottycinco,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:47:25 2015 UTC,"I thought the only big free agent we had a Chance with was DJ.    Only because he could continue living in LA (so stability)  our popularity could propel him to the all star game like he wants,  he'd have a chance to be a bigger part of our offense.   Outside of that,  no reason for him or anyone else to come here.   I was hoping for next level players to come here and make us attractive the following year.   Robin Lopez and Demarre Carroll to fill up our needs for rim protection,  defense and 3pt shooting."
lakers,3brot2,strategolegends,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:48:02 2015 UTC,So far it seems like we're gonna strike out
lakers,3brot2,nu1stunna,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:08:49 2015 UTC,"I said this before and got down voted. However, I didn't want Demarcus. Arguably I wanted Deandre more for defense. However my point is we need to build a foundation for players to come. Of course a large free agent attracts more but a strong foundation and a winning culture is what brings people. We got D'Lo and we have a great looking young core. Now all we need to is to add a few quality pieces and start winning more games. If we build a good core, then the aldriges, Durants and loves will come. We might have the next Chris Paul on our hands and we need to show that off."

lakers,3brot2,Dozens562,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"It could be a blessing in disguise. Kobe's huge contract will be expired. Our young guys will have had another year under their belt to develop. If we stayed mediocre, we could have added another piece in next years draft (or traded it for a player) and maybe next year we would have a legitimate chance to offer two max contract offers with the idea that we are a young and upcoming team with the salary cap of a big market as a legitimate pitch to star free agents."
lakers,3brot2,r_u_effing_serious,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:31:44 2015 UTC,"FA's are using the specter of the Lakers as leverage to get better deals elsewhere. We haven't really signed a max level star free agent in many years. Most of the great transactions made in the last 20 years were trades. Went through this last year, struck out on all the big time guys and ended up throwing together a mish mash of conflicting talent. Use this year as a developmental year for some of the younger players, figure out what Randle and Clarkson are really about, and hope we hit big on a fringe player."
lakers,3brot2,r_u_effing_serious,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:37:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not at the ""should have drafted Okafor"" phase yet. But I'm teetering on the edge.  Hopefully we'll be able to make something happen."
lakers,3brot2,StealthRUs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:23:20 2015 UTC,"At this rate, there's no point in Kobe playing next season. If we're going to miss the playoffs, we may as well tank again. Now I am of the mindset that taking Russell over Okafor was a mistake. I wanted Okafor before the draft, but wasn't extremely upset when we decided take the other route. Nobody wants to come here. I don't want players on the team that don't want to be the reason for the Lakers success anyway, and would rather just be there along for the ride. ""I don't want to go to the Lakers if they aren't contenders."" Well exactly what were you planning on contributing then? They can be contenders if you sign with the team you freaking idiot. I hate these free agents attitudes. Okafor wanted to be here. I think we would have had an easier time finding a point guard in free agency either this year or next."

lakers,3brot2,ArbitraryLurker24,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:10:33 2015 UTC,We can't sign people on the hope that our core will soon be all-stars.   Our guys need to turn heads this year so FAs want to come and play with them.
lakers,3brot2,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:40:40 2015 UTC,"Somewhat. Of all the top tier free agents, I thought Aldridge was our best bet. What the Lakers need to do is start focusing on building a team first and then signing a star player."

lakers,3brot2,FreshDiamond,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:24:17 2015 UTC,Yes.  Because it's fairly common knowledge now that our combination of front office staff and roster don't know how to make a strong impression on free agents.  Downvote me if you want but it's the truth.  We suck at it.
lakers,3brot2,Tjryannnn,2,Wed Jul 1 17:54:19 2015 UTC,"Eh. Who have we really gone after lately though? Dwight and Melo and now LMA? Melo would have had to turn down a ton of money and LaLa is on a show filmed in New York. Dwight left for Dwight reasons and LMA is still just hearsay from last night, plus he's been rumored to want to go to San Antonio for some time now.  It's also hard to wow a free agent like LMA when his alternate choice, San Antonio, will be a top contender with him on the team."
lakers,3brot2,FreshDiamond,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:56:15 2015 UTC,I hear you and i would love nothing more than to find out that I'm wrong.  I'm just not feeling good about all of this now.
lakers,3brot2,JHeezy19,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:33:34 2015 UTC,"Next off season could be wildly different. One thing that we didn't have going for us is a showing of our rookie core. Randle was hurt. Clarkson started to thrive at the end of the season.  But this year if they all stay healthy, we can put out a young lineup of;  Russell, Clarkson, Black and Randle...that's a solid young group and if  they can get some major run together to show off what they got it might entice some dudes."
lakers,3brot2,FreshDiamond,0,Wed Jul 1 18:36:59 2015 UTC,"Dwight left for Dwight reasons   Dwight left because our front office chose Kobe and D'Antoni over him.  Our front office failed that test big time.  People here can hate on Dwight all they want, but LMA wouldn't be passing on us if we had Dwight."

lakers,3brot2,JHeezy19,0,Wed Jul 1 16:49:46 2015 UTC,"Why hasn't anyone mentioned Andre Drummond? Only 21 years old, Averaged 13/13/2 blocks last year. Although he is still under contract with the Pistons, he'll be a RFA in 2016. I think he'll be a steal next summer, especially under the radar with other big names in free agency then. Young enough to develop with our young team as well"
lakers,3brot2,ashishvp,3,Wed Jul 1 18:33:47 2015 UTC,He's not going anywhere.  Drummond is the reason they're letting Monroe go.

lakers,3bu2u0,high5ghost,2,Thu Jul 2 05:42:36 2015 UTC,I would move on. That's what happened last off season when they waited too long on Melo and missed out on everyone else.

Remember, in order to lure a premier FA, we need to show we have a good core that will compete.   At this point it looks like we have no choice but to develop the talent that we have. We should get the best available talent to support that."
lakers,3bu2u0,jon_snow_jones,7,Thu Jul 2 04:07:02 2015 UTC,"Tobias Harris is only 22. How sweet would it be for us to have our PG, SG, SF, and PF all hit their primes at the same time!? Tell me that wouldn't be enticing for future FAs."

The reason why OKC had to trade Harden was because they had to pay Ibaka and didn't want to go into the luxury tax. Small market teams really are at a disadvantage.  You better believe that the Lakers would gladly pay heavy luxury taxes if it meant they could get a few more championships."
lakers,3bu2u0,jon_snow_jones,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:02:14 2015 UTC,Real reason: cheap and dumb owner. Harden was better than Ibaka back then and they chose the wrong guy.
lakers,3bu2u0,Thidwicks_Ultimatum,2,Thu Jul 2 07:51:21 2015 UTC,Oh yeah definitely. As long as Tobias will grow with the system/team then we should go for it. I actually would like to get him and RoLo as long as it doesn't cripple future flexibility
lakers,3bu2u0,Thidwicks_Ultimatum,2,Thu Jul 2 04:52:08 2015 UTC,"It really wouldn't be bad at all. The cap is set to go up to around $90 million next offseason from roughly $69 million. Plus Kobe's contract coming off the books. That would leave the Lakers with a young promising lineup, no Kobe, and approximately $46 million of cap space.   Now I know everyone is hoping for Durant next year, but realistically he's probably returning to OKC or going to DC. What if we instead used the space on Drummond and Conley Jr.? We could make Clarkson our 6th man and our starting roster could look like this.  PG - Conley Jr.  SG - Russell  SF - Harris  PF - Randle  C - Drummond  Now this is all hypothetical of course, but you get the point. With a young, burgeoning lineup and $46 million in cap space next year. The sky's the limit."
lakers,3bu2u0,Thidwicks_Ultimatum,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:08:52 2015 UTC,You think Detroit would let Monroe walk if they werent planning on maxing out Drummond? Hes not going anywhere.
lakers,3bu2u0,SSD65,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:19:42 2015 UTC,"Hence the word hypothetical. I just threw it out there as a scenario in which we get a couple of marquee free agents to go with our young core. I happened to pick Conley and Drummon, because filling those positions the way that I did would really strengthen the roster of the Lakers.  I didn't exactly mean that those guys in particular were coming over or even available."
lakers,3bu2u0,scootify,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:28:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree that the PG position is a core need at this point, as long as we can develop Clarkson and Russell. I would argue that the wing and the center are far more important. While I would love to be able to grab Drummond, thats a total pipedream and not even worth hypothesizing over"
lakers,3bu2u0,ashishvp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:18:22 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but I really only see Clarkson as a great 6th man. In any case, if it makes you feel better forget I put Conley or Drummond there and just remember that we'll have $46+ million to spend on FAs however they see fit."
lakers,3bu2u0,justsomeguy5,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:57:08 2015 UTC,"Even if Clarkson turns into a great 6th man, that would mean he would back up Russell. In which case were pretty well set at that spot. Ideally, Jimmy Butler would sign a 1 year deal with Chicago and we'd sign him on at the wing spot next season, but I think the Bulls will try and lock him up (even though he has made it public he wants to be a Laker). Of course, Russell can play the off guard spot too, which makes Westbrook a possibility for the year after next, who also has expressed a desire to play for LA. After the wing, we really need a servicable defensive Center. We dont need a max guy there. And if Upshaw (fingers crossed) can drop the bottle and rise to his potential, we have our backup Center already..."
lakers,3bu2u0,Schneeky,4,Fri Jul 3 16:24:22 2015 UTC,I want Harris. Thought Lakers would go for him instantly. Hopefully Harris and Lopez.
lakers,3bu2u0,Thidwicks_Ultimatum,2,Thu Jul 2 04:00:36 2015 UTC,or even if we don't get rolo just throw the same contract at ed davis..  and anyone who doesn't like tobias harris just remember he was a high ranked draft prospect since highschool whereas someone like middleton wasn't and just got paid $70 mil.. harris is consistently good to say the least
lakers,3bu2u0,high5ghost,2,Thu Jul 2 05:08:28 2015 UTC,It's like the Lakers trying to throw money at the high roller casino hoping to get a jackpot.  But you win more money betting small and winning small ;D
lakers,3bwbkn,AranciataExcess,11,Thu Jul 2 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"Windhorst, shut up and stop acting like this was a dealbreaker for LMA. Go back to stalking LeBron.

lakers,3bwbkn,Citizen_of_Atlantis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:06:50 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree, but suggesting that the Lakers' problems in free agency are simply related to the lack of player talent is like burying your head in the sand.   The fact is the Bucks aren't necessarily better than the Lakers in terms of on-the-court personnel - and they certainly don't have a better culture surrounding the team, yet they were able to sign Greg Monroe and the Lakers weren't.   What Windhorst is talking about, and what other NBA insiders are discussing, is how the Lakers' basketball operations department has not been adapting to new analytical technologies that other teams have been instituting for years. Many teams use internal and external data crunchers, analysts, and even sports scientists to break down and study every aspect of the team and individual players' games. These data are used to help improve the coaching, the personnel choices, the training, etc. The Lakers have invested in virtually none of it, and players today are extremely technically savvy. They understand the importance of sports science, they want it. It's a big deal.  That's what Windhorst was writing about. The Lakers are a premiere franchise, it's about time they act like one - be on the cutting edge of these technologies and others to improve the organization. These things matter when it comes to making the organization attractive to players and coaches."
lakers,3bwbkn,exsisto,4,Thu Jul 2 18:25:20 2015 UTC,"Saying that ""the Bucks aren't necessarily better in terms of on court personnel"" is burying your head in the sand with respect to just how bad our roster is.

Put it this way - if the CP3 trade DIDN'T get axed, and we went into yesterday's meeting with CP3 and Dwight (I'm assuming w/ CP3 Dwight never leaves) - I don't think our lack of analytics would matter one bit.    And if Russell wins ROTY while Randle is averaging 18-9 and we simultaneously hit a miracle in the lottery and get the #1 overall pick (Ben Simmons is gonna be a monster) I am 100% confident our FA pitches will be MUCH stronger next summer, w/ or w/o analytics."

If that's true, that's more information about our analytics department than has been divulged in the past.    Everything that is known about our analytics department comes from this espn article and it isn't pretty:  We have a staff of six analytics people, only two of which have been publicly identified: Rudy Tomjonovich and his son.  Two of the other 4 people live in Boston, and the head of our analytics team is an old friend that went to UCLA with Kupchack when he got his MBA.

Tom Penn said the reason why FAs aren't signing with the Lakers (or the Knicks) is because of the the players they have on their rosters not because they aren't using analytics. These FAs want to play for teams who can make it to the playoffs this upcoming season not sign with a non playoff contending team and wait a year to get help. I bet if the Lakers had a better roster, most of these FAs would be salivating at the opportunity to play with the Lakers."

If we used those bullshit analytics back when Kobe was still a rookie, he would have been traded for a bag of peanuts.   Fuck Windhorst, fuck ESPN, and fuck everything about the game today.

The league isn't soft cause no one wants to play for a team that won 21 games. No one wanted to go to the Clipper even though they were in L.A when they were losers.   Aldridge is 30, he doesn't have 2-3 years to be part of a puzzle when he can make the same money in his home state and be a contender.   KLove's only playoff games were cut short by a goofy Celtic and had to ride the pine knowing he could actually be apart of something great. Why would he leave that behind to try and rebuild for a few years? I know fuck Dan Gilbert and all that but who wouldn't want to play along Lebron and get paid?  Marc Gasol? The way we treated Pau, his name in every rumor for year after year. Why go through that when you can be the king of Memphis making the playoffs and being a DPOY challenger.   Jimmy Butler. RFA Chicago owns his soul, no way we could've gotten him.  Tyson Chandler is on his last legs and the dude's getting paid, no way we give him that length or money, we'd be worse off with him in the long run, why sacrifice that for 2 more wins, if that?  Danny Green. The man clearly loved San Antonio with the contract he took, guy just wants to win, can't call him soft for taking that contract so he can thrive under Pop.  DeMarre Carroll. I don't know, we could've gotten him, I guess? Guy's good, making big bucks, but for a guy who's only looked this good under the Hawks I don't know if you can trust him to do as well.  Lakers aren't in a good spot, you want two things in this league, especially if you're a sought after UFA, you want a payday and/or to win. And the Lakers don't want to offer someone a huge contract, and they can't promise any wins. I just wish the guys listed didn't use us for leverage, that's what hurts the most......  /rant"

lakers,3buoel,HellFireNT,0,Thu Jul 2 10:00:17 2015 UTC,"Has the league become so soft that they want all star talent around and don't want to rebuild or be part of that puzzle?   Look. I'm an oldschool fan and I've watched the league change from team-driven or coach-driven to player driven. This is truly a player's league and I think what LBJ did in Cleveland is only the beginning. We're going to see puppet coaches and puppet FOs. It's not enough to just draw up the plays or shut down your coach, you have to get some insane contract for Tristan Suckass because he's your boy.  Kobe already has a huge say with how the Lakers run their business. If you're a FA and you want to come in, make this your team and put your stamp on things, who's standing in your way?  Kobe Bryant.   Look - for all we know, he's going to have a FO position like D Wade when he retires. You wanna come in here and claim the team from him? Because that's what you'd have to do. It's not like he's volunteering. Kobe isn't out there going ""I just wanna turn it over, come off the bench, mentor, shoot the ball in stretches and score buckets of points quickly, pass if I'm cold"" etc.   No. He still thinks he's the man. Whoever comes here to build their own legacy is building onto Kobe's legacy. You aren't ""part of a puzzle"" as much as you're a tool in Kobe's toolbox.   Any FA worth having doesn't want to do that. FFS, lifelong Laker fan Paul Pierce just chose the mother fucking Clippers over us. You know why? Because he wants to be part of a winning puzzle. Kobe thinks we're gonna win now, not rebuild. Clearly Pierce didn't agree. He signed for $3m/yr. We could have afforded that! Seriously! This is a completely different set of philosophies going on here and the FAs out there know that. I hope to Jerry we get LMA, but maybe it'll take losing him to teach Laker fan a god damned lesson about what's up in Lakerland.   Players don't like Kobe?   It's not that they don't like him, it's that they don't want to play with him. They want him to play with them. That's the difference. It'll take a great man to come in and sublimate their own ego and wait out Kobe's retirement.    Don't believe in jim buss vision?    Jim Buss has no vision. He has no idea what he's doing. It's Kobe's vision. For as offencive as this LBJ shit is in Cleveland, at least they're being honest about who's calling the shots there. If you're a FA, why do you care what Jim Buss has to say? There's a retarded, 2-headed management system with he and Jeannie that doesn't even get along and the real decision-maker, Kobe Bryant isn't even the one hiring you. It's like having some errand boy be sent to jerk you around. Kobe's the guy you have to deal with. But it's not his team, it's Jim's team. Except it isn't. It's Kobe's team. Jim is just too incompetent to take control of it for himself.  Jerry left a power vacuum and Jim wasn't strong enough to take it, so Kobe did. Jim Buss can have all the vision in the world, but he's clearly not in charge."

lakers,3bs9mw,shootmans,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:05:30 2015 UTC,Shaq doesn't happen without West. But that isn't comparable at all whatsoever to what's going down right now.  Not going to lose sleep over missing out on a 30 year old jumpshooting big that's never been out of the 2nd round or a 110 million defensive sieve that will most likely spend the majority of that contract on injured reserve.
lakers,3bs9mw,PatronSaintOfUpdog,0,Wed Jul 1 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"I think everyone is greatly exaggerrating out free agent influence.. Someone name the last BIG NAME free agent we signed from another team.  There are two answers really. Ron Artest and Shaq. Hell, throw in Payton too."
lakers,3bs9mw,CalmerThanYouAreDood,5,Thu Jul 2 07:11:55 2015 UTC,I think you're greatly exaggerating yourself man. The Lakers have been capped out for the past decade until the last two offseasons. Shaq was last big name FA we landed because he was the last one we really went for.
lakers,3bs9mw,PatronSaintOfUpdog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:09:32 2015 UTC,"Man and that was in 1996. We're lucky there's reported interest from guy like LMA considering how bad we are as a team. We were 53-29 the season before we signed Shaq, we're worse than the opposite of that now."
lakers,3bs9mw,CalmerThanYouAreDood,3,Wed Jul 1 19:27:15 2015 UTC,It was but you can't make it seem like we've lost out on hundreds of FAs in the last 20 years when we really haven't been after any.
lakers,3bs9mw,PatronSaintOfUpdog,3,Wed Jul 1 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm not trying to make it seems like that. I just don't like the ""FAs will sign in LA because its LA"" thing that circles around Laker fan groups. There's much more to signing guys than that."
lakers,3bs9mw,JustAGuy993,2,Wed Jul 1 19:43:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and Payton was past his prime.  Then you go back to..Kareem?  The Lakers have gotten like 3 big FAs in their history.  Hard to consider Artest or payton a ""big"" FA."

With these mid-tier players it will give a chance for our rookies to shine. I am glad we havent made any gigantic moves because with gigantic moves come gigantic commitments. Do we have money? yes. Do we have any trade assets? not really. I hope we keep our pieces and development clarkson, randle and russel around Kobe."
lakers,3bsbcj,javi2123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:26:00 2015 UTC,Do we have money? yes.   What's your definition of having money? Because from what I hear the team only has the money to offer one max contract. This era of basketball has shown that superstars want to play with other superstars.

lakers,3bsbcj,JustAGuy993,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:31:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I think this summer we just need one solid piece that could be in the plans for the future. Someone like RoLo or Harris. We don't need superstars at this point. We need quality role players THEN we can bring the big names
lakers,3bsbcj,bmarshall12,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:39:30 2015 UTC,yep the lakers need some of those mid tiers guys so they can start building a winning culture again and not be at the top of the lottery every year.

lakers,3brwym,Sletts,4,Wed Jul 1 17:41:16 2015 UTC,We are currently in need for a big man thou. We first need to fill that hole before we attack another. The lack of a strong center was mainly (im assuming) a deal breaker to Aldridge.
lakers,3brwym,nigg_a,3,Wed Jul 1 18:45:42 2015 UTC,I mean if we max out someone like Tobias we'd still have enough to probably sign RoLo or Chandler which I'd be totally fine with.
lakers,3brwym,Sletts,3,Wed Jul 1 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"Chandler to the Suns, but that just opens up Brandan Wright"
lakers,3brwym,flea61,2,Wed Jul 1 19:34:06 2015 UTC,Yeah I heard... We're really not moving fast enough to snag any of these guys. But I love Wright and RoLo hasn't been spoken about once in any rumors which is weird to me. We need to get the ball rolling.
lakers,3brwym,Sletts,3,Wed Jul 1 19:36:32 2015 UTC,We are also in dire need of a Small Forward. We're in need of everything except a good point guard
lakers,3brwym,thevisitor,2,Wed Jul 1 19:57:54 2015 UTC,We have kobe and young to play sf. Not really a HUGE need as the center position which we currently have no establish player so yes we have a very strong big man need and is possibly is a turn off to some pfs
lakers,3brwym,nigg_a,-1,Wed Jul 1 20:00:56 2015 UTC,Don't think it had anything to do w/ not having a C. The Lakers could've signed a C shortly after making a deal w/ Aldridge.
lakers,3brwym,TimeisIllmatic95,5,Wed Jul 1 19:25:01 2015 UTC,"Dude is the same age as 2/3 of our draft picks, averaged 17 & 8, is the prototypical 3/stretch4 option for modern nba and people are avoiding him like the plague, hes literally perfect for our team, if our young core of d'angelo, clarkson, randle, Harris & (hopefully) upshaw can win with kobe next year, we add a defensive center (asik?), maybe we can attract some looks from prime-age stars, because there will be actual evidence on of improvement on the floor, unlike now.  Y'all need to stop hating on a guy you've probably never even watched! He's going to be a star-calibur player, and is clearly our missing piece. i would be ecstatic if we signed him and even more ecstatic when i can say i told you so to all the nay-sayers"

lakers,3brwym,megavino,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:42:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. As much as I like Jordan, he aint comin, and honestly that might be for the better.

lakers,3brwym,apoliticalscientist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"Actually, I don't think that is for the better. Jordan is in the beginning of his prime, and is still pretty young. If he signs with us, it gives us a good shot at Durant next season, provided that Russell and Randle develop well this season. Kobe will also be off the books and we'll have enough cap space to sign anyone we want."
lakers,3brwym,kobe_bryant24,-3,Thu Jul 2 16:22:31 2015 UTC,As they shouldn't. He is not a max contract guy at all. He just isn't that good and his skill set isn't that valuable. He could be a great 2nd or 3rd option but he doesn't do anything well enough to be the 1st option or a huge specialist type player like deandre.

lakers,3brwym,kobe_bryant24,2,Thu Jul 2 00:15:53 2015 UTC,A max contract this year will be peanuts in a couple years. That's why every team is handing out huge contracts. So a max contract at 16 mil this year might be 25% of the cap but when the cap rises above 90 mil then his contract becomes a bargain. So we should absolutely do it!
lakers,3brwym,high5ghost,-3,Wed Jul 1 17:46:47 2015 UTC,It is not peanuts. 25% is not as big of a jump as you think. He is not that good. There is a reason Orlando isn't going to match the max. He just isn't good enough.
lakers,3brwym,Citizen_of_Atlantis,5,Wed Jul 1 18:00:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think* I explained it clearly. The max of  the salary cap this year (69 mil). His max salary would be 15.7 mil. Sounds like a lot doesn't it, but the cap is expected to jump to 90 mil the season after this one. Which makes his contract to 17% of the cap. Then the season after that the cap is projected to his 108 mil so his salary becomes only 15% of the Lakers' cap.   As the salary cap rises exponentially over the next years all the free agents teams are signing this summer become bargains. That's why teams are trying to sign guys for as long as possible.   He would be over-payed heavily for one season but then he would become an absolute steal in the next few years. A quick fix isn't happening for us so we should focus on building our team for the future.

lakers,3brwym,Tjryannnn,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:31:14 2015 UTC,"Yep, I completely agree with this reasoning. I'd sign him to max, or near-max (whatever it takes to make sure Magic don't match) if we strike out on LMA or DJ.   He shores up our 3 for years to come in case we also strike out on KD/Butler/etc..., meaning we can concentrate on other FA positions in the future  like Center - i.e. boogie in 3 years."

lakers,3bwom0,duragjones,2,Thu Jul 2 19:41:15 2015 UTC,I think you're missing the point. This team is bad. That's the reason we can't attract an FA. An injured Kobe Bryant with 1 years left on his contract that gave a 3 minute speech in a 2 hour meeting isn't the reason FAs don't want to come. Let's try to get 1 max player before dreaming of 2.   We would be in this position even if Dwight were chosen over Kobe. See: Orlando Magic. Now imagine that team in the west.
lakers,3bwom0,likwidsage,2,Thu Jul 2 19:57:08 2015 UTC,"It's not Kobe's fault.  It's Jimmy's fault.  When we were in this situation with Kobe and Shaq, Dr. Buss knew that Kobe was the future and traded Shaq.  If Jimmy had committed to keeping Dwight and letting Kobe go, we wouldn't be in the situation we are in now.  Everyone here can bitch and moan all they want about Dwight being soft or whatever, but he's in contention and we're not.  He's a guy that other guys want to play with.  Carmelo or Lebron would've come here to play with Dwight."
lakers,3bwom0,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:56:09 2015 UTC,You don't allow someone to be alpha. The alpha is the alpha until another alpha comes along and takes alpha status. Dwight was an alpha or beta he was a pussy. This is a dumb post

lakers,3bwom0,pistolpete4407,0,Thu Jul 2 19:48:23 2015 UTC,"I was against it.  Once Dwight was gone, I wanted them to either sign Kobe at a Duncan-like discount or let him walk."

I really want LA to come but lets be real here, where ever LA goes, he's not going to be the man dictating the offense. He doesn't have the skill set to do something like that."
lakers,3bspu9,likwidsage,4,Wed Jul 1 21:09:27 2015 UTC,and what's wrong with Kobe comparing LA's role to Pau?  Kobe & Pau won 2 rings together and they complemented each other's game.
lakers,3bspu9,Cap_N_Crunch,6,Wed Jul 1 21:23:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think anything is wrong at all. It's just the second fiddle part isn't inherit in that role, which is what I was speaking about. That said, LA will always have to play second fiddle to someone if he want's to join a good team. He's not capable of leading a team to contention."
lakers,3bspu9,likwidsage,2,Wed Jul 1 21:32:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely.  I don't get why people get worked up or think Kobe is always asking people to play second fiddle to him.  Kobe is certainly not the player he was 5 years ago, but him and LA can have the same dynamic Kobe had with Pau.  Not always having the ball in your hand doesn't mean you're playing second fiddle to anyone else."
lakers,3bspu9,Cap_N_Crunch,-1,Wed Jul 1 23:24:03 2015 UTC,This a grown man Kobe is talking to. It's about giving people respect. Everyone knows Pau was Kobe's bitch. Why would anyone want that role. It doesn't matter if Kobe didn't intend for it to come off that way the point is it did.

lakers,3bspu9,SevTheNiceGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:21:00 2015 UTC,Its the obvious inference from LA's perspective as that is what Gasol did.  Even worse it's a sad reality for the Lakers.  Why do you think it fell flat?
lakers,3bspu9,jerkidiot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:21:59 2015 UTC,100% agree. LA is a good player and an all-star. He is a not a super star and he is not someone you build around.   He was the #1 option in Portland for the past 9(?) years and he hasn't won anything.  The guy is not a number one performer yet he is asking for number one money (which he'll get) and still asking to be the number one guy.   You don't tell a 5 time NBA champ and a top 5 player in NBA history to take a back seat to your half-assed 9 year career where you can't get out of the playoffs.   fuck that dude....   In 30 years NBA fans will be talking about Kobe Bryant.   In 30 years no one will know who the fuck Lamarcus Aldridge is.

lakers,3bspu9,SevTheNiceGuy,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"Kobe is delusional if he believes he's the same player from 5 years ago. No wonder LMA was turned off by the Lakers presentation.   Memo to Jeanie and Jim, please don't bring Kobe to any future meetings with potential FA signings."
lakers,3bspu9,Musingmike,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:05:03 2015 UTC,Kobe's broken legs and 18th year averages 22 ppg..   younger lamarcus averaged 23...   A half mobile Bryant is better then 95% of the players in the league   right now...
lakers,3bspu9,SevTheNiceGuy,2,Wed Jul 1 22:36:16 2015 UTC,He didn't even play half the damn season. Just stop.
lakers,3bspu9,Scarlatina,2,Thu Jul 2 05:00:46 2015 UTC,yet he put 22 ppg...  averages are averages...  you think Kobe Bryant finishes a year averaging 12ppg?
lakers,3bspu9,SevTheNiceGuy,2,Thu Jul 2 05:57:23 2015 UTC,"*On 20.4 FGAs and 37 FG% in 35 games total  Edit: For comparison, Klay Thompson averaged 22 ppg, on 17 FGAs and 46 FG%"
lakers,3bspu9,Scarlatina,0,Thu Jul 2 02:47:40 2015 UTC,NBA was founded in 1949. Since then the NBA has not implemented an efficiency requirement to play the game or sign a contract..  out of 441 players in the league only 15 of them average 20 or more points per game.   Had Kobe finished the year out he would have been one of them.
lakers,3bspu9,SevTheNiceGuy,2,Thu Jul 2 06:13:11 2015 UTC,"Since then the NBA has not implemented an efficiency requirement to play the game or sign a contract.   What kind of argument is that? ""The NBA doesn't crack down on people that take a ton of poor shots!"" Yes, of course they don't, why is that even a point? A lot of players can put up gaudy numbers if they didn't give a shit about efficiency and shot 18-35 shots a game.  The question is do free agents really want to play with a soon-to-be 37 year old Kobe that is making 7.6 shots out of ever 20.4 he is taking (and thinks he can still be the #1 option over them)."
lakers,3bspu9,owningypsie,0,Thu Jul 2 07:13:24 2015 UTC,"the point is that Kobe is still better then they are...   LMA has been in the league for 9 years and all he has to show for it is 4 all star ballots.   That's it.   How the hell do you walk into a room with Kobe Bryant and try to convince Kobe Bryant that your 9 year career and 4 all star appearances; zero shit accomplished in the playoffs or the finals, is some how better than his current career?   LMA is a 20+ ppg guy.. So is Kobe. LMA has a career 48% shooting percentage and that does not stand out against Kobe's career 45%.   The Lakers are selling the idea to LMA that he can be a very integral part to the Lakers franchise. LMA is trying to sell himself to the The Lakers that he is a top guy and key building piece. The problem for LMA is that there is 9 years of proof that contends with his position that he can be a top guy. He was the top guy at Portland and it yielded NOTHING!  When you walk into a room and want to tell the current best player on the team that you should be considered the best player on the team, it helps to have the numbers and the record to back that up.   Lamarcus Aldridge, Kevin Love, and Greg Monroe do not have that, and probably will never have that."
lakers,3bspu9,owningypsie,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:36:45 2015 UTC,"This title is completely misleading from the message in the tweet   Kobe spoke for about three minutes in the presentation, said he envisioned LaMarcus Aldridge working with him the same way Pau Gasol did."

lakers,3bspu9,TeamYeezy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:58:22 2015 UTC,"So you are making the assumption that LMA's disinterest was due to his not wanting to ""play second fiddle"" while your evidence is that Kobe brought up a potential for analogy to the Kobe/Pau pairing.

lakers,3bstf8,suitntiekid18,4,Wed Jul 1 21:36:36 2015 UTC,That's just his team being professional. As a professional you want to tell all of the teams urself ur plans not sign there. You don't just leave it to the media and never call them back. So all this means is that LMA plans to tell Lakers directly he won't sign.   Edit: we saw the same with Dwight. It leaked to media he wasn't staying before he had a conversation with Mitch. And he didn't want to make his rockets intentions official until he contacted all other suitors first.

I'm sure Reggie ended up in a lot of 1 on 1 matchups with Kobe when Ron was on the court. And kobe was probably being Kobe. Getting under players skin. Kobe low key used to get under guys skin with little minor things like Dwight does now. Remember the infamous Kobe vs artest scuffle back in 09. But unlike Dwight, Kobe not a fake tough guy. He won't throw first punch. But he'll elbow u in the gut, and hit u for 3pts and stare u down like ""yea I did it, so what""... Unlike Dwight who will elbow u in the head, miss a easy layup, then be like "" huh what happen?"""

lakers,3bsv76,aveydey,2,Thu Jul 2 02:32:33 2015 UTC,Sounds good to me. We need magic as the face of Lakers so these players show respect to ownership.

lakers,3bsv76,FuriousFlex,2,Thu Jul 2 03:21:46 2015 UTC,These young guys don't wanna hear about how they have the opportunity to be Kobe's new sidekick.
lakers,3bsv76,DUBBZZ,2,Wed Jul 1 22:57:43 2015 UTC,"Knick fan checking in, I see Kobe as a big obstacle for a team that has a solid foundation(Clarkson,Russell,Randle and cap space).  How would you like to play for an old school coach that preaches discipline and effort but doesn't hold Kobe accountable at all.  From not playing defense to jacking up 3's, what would Kobe have to do to get reigned in or benched?  The sad thing is that when he wants to, Kobe is an excellent distributor.  He'll show glimpses of that for a few games and when he does the Lakers are much more competitive.  But he can't ever get away from who he is and will always go back to a shoot first mentality despite double teams.  He still sees himself as the alpha dog and it's not going to end well, aging is undefeated.  As long as he's there, I think it lessens free agents attraction to LA."
lakers,3bsv76,ynksjts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:56:06 2015 UTC,"I think you're right but the Lakers have a way to attract free agents, especially young ones by saying, ""Hey Kobe's on his way out and you could be our premeir superstar for the next 5 years."" The Lakers just need to develop their talent and then think about free agents. If any of out draft picks pan out, then LA becomes attractive again. The best chance for that would be if D'angelo becomes great because everybody wants to play with a guy who can spread it around on the floor."
lakers,3bsv76,ynksjts,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:44:06 2015 UTC,"All they need him to say is I'm not the same player as I used to be but I can still help us win.

lakers,3bsv76,probotic,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:34:17 2015 UTC,I think we have too much talent to tank. We might win around 35 games and anything more means that Randle and D'angelo had great great seasons.
lakers,3bsv76,StealthRUs,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:40:11 2015 UTC,"It was said that LMA didn't hear what he wanted from Kobe.  To me that says he wanted to be told he'd be the guy, more about how we are going to build around you type talk, not hearing about Magic Johnson and his magic card success."
lakers,3bsv76,YHWHandSon,-1,Wed Jul 1 21:45:37 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, but both statements are true.  Yes, we are a rebuilding team, and yes, Kobe, fucked up the pitch."
lakers,3bsv76,FreshDiamond,6,Wed Jul 1 21:39:42 2015 UTC,"What could his pitch have possibly been?  The guy is on his way out the door, and he can't stay healthy.  This shit ain't on Kobe, it's up to the FO to tell whatever big name free agent that, hey, even though Kobe is still around, this will be YOUR team."
lakers,3bsv76,StealthRUs,2,Wed Jul 1 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"It's not Kobe' fault directly. The lakers should know that Kobe rubs a lot of these guys the wrong way and STOP BRINGING HIM. I mean even the Nash thing they weren't exactly on the same page but Nash was an incredibly unselfish guy and Kobe was a lot better if player back then. Now Kobe isn't Kobe anymore so it's harder for players to accept his attitude. Also his ""retirement"" is very much up in the air."
lakers,3bsv76,ciths,0,Wed Jul 1 21:56:05 2015 UTC,"If Kobe is telling LMA that he has to fit in with him rather than saying that he'll take whatever role that LMA wants him to take, then it could've turned LMA off especially if the Lakers decide to keep Kobe around after this year.    Think of it this way - the only reason LMA would come here is to be the alpha dog and cement a legacy by pulling this team out of the lottery and into contention.  It's already asking enough of him to come to a lottery team, but (on top of that) he would have to put up with Kobe's BS on top of that when Kobe is no longer a good enough player to justify dealing with him.  That's a bridge too far from him with no ironclad guarantee that Kobe will be gone after this year.  It was just 2 years ago, when Dwight asked how much longer Kobe planned to play where Kobe responded 3-4 more years - and Dwight was immediately out the door."
lakers,3bsv76,duragjones,-4,Wed Jul 1 21:52:06 2015 UTC,History doesn't win you games. The Lakers Front Office is trying to sell the history of the lakers. Its been 19 years since you guys signed a HUGE free agent ( Shaq). Build through the draft like the Warriors.
lakers,3bsv76,ciths,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:00:13 2015 UTC,Only thing is we don't have any drafts picks
lakers,3bsv76,Thefirmbiz,0,Wed Jul 1 22:08:37 2015 UTC,Goes to show you that the front office isn't doing a great job then. Why isn't there more rumblings of fans being angry with the front office? You guys need a new voice. Mitch is out of touch. IF any other GM traded first round draft picks for Steve Nash he would be fired Same thing with Dwight Howard.
lakers,3bsv76,C3PO1Fan,3,Wed Jul 1 22:15:25 2015 UTC,I agree that we should be angry with our front office but I put most if not all the blame on Jim Buss. The guy chose d'antoni over Phil Jackson and preferred to build around Nash instead of Dwight. Mitch wanted to hire Jackson but didn't have much of a say in it. we are in this mess because of Jim Buss bad decisions.
lakers,3bsv76,duragjones,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:54:26 2015 UTC,"Be mad at the passage of time.  The Lakers are out of contention now because they got old.  And they're in a deep hole because they made some high risk moves to try and keep that window open.  But even if those moves had worked, the Lakers would be facing a pretty difficult rebuild right around now anyway.  Like if you tell me you think after the Lakers lost to the Thunder they should've blown everything up right then, I'll listen but I didn't see anyone saying that at the time.  The Lakers didn't bottom out after Magic retired because the bottom of the league was awful due to expansion, but this isn't the first time the Lakers have been rebuilding and they're about a year behind the pace of their last rebuild right around now."
lakers,3bsv76,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:53:34 2015 UTC,"I have to the agree. Dwight staying with us should've been the only priority.

I'm sure Kobe would've taken less that's can you believe that was the fo initial offer?!"
lakers,3bsv76,aveydey,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:24:43 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why we believe Mitch is some wizard. I guarantee if we didn't draft Clarkson we would be against Mitch and not repeating ""in Mitch we trust"" over and over again."

lakers,3bryea,Diesel46,7,Wed Jul 1 17:44:43 2015 UTC,"Its time to face reality, if you think LA is taking max over here to play with a unproven PG and PF, OVER the San Antonio Spurs with Duncan, Parker, Green, Ginobili, and Popovich, then I'll have what you're having.   LA is 30. He wants to win and go to a contender. Enough said."
lakers,3bryea,jasoyang,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:18:17 2015 UTC,"I agree that he would be crazy to pick LA over spurs, but not for those you listed. Every one of those guys has been linked with stories of retirement, Parker is broken. Pop will likely retire with Duncan, or shortly after. But they do have good pieces going forward like kawhi and green. There is a lot of uncertainty with what will happen in a post pop/Duncan Era. The one thing we have going for us is that we've always drafted well in the top 5,and we have talented young players. For lamarcus Aldridge it'll come down to now vs later imo."
lakers,3bryea,likwidsage,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"True, I even forgot about Kawhi. Bottom line is while the Spurs are linked to retirement, they have the pieces now to contend and we don't."
lakers,3bryea,jasoyang,12,Wed Jul 1 18:30:51 2015 UTC,"I don't really like Monroe. He's got a good post game, but he's a terrible defender. He's a PF naturally, so playing him at C would be a terrible idea. If we miss out on Aldridge or DJ, we should just look to sign a defensive minded center who can protect the paint and doesn't ask for the ball. A nucleus of the young guys plus a defensive center should be a better team than the one we had this year, and it'd allow the young guys to truly develop."
lakers,3bryea,CoolScales,4,Wed Jul 1 17:54:29 2015 UTC,"He isn't a terrible defender, he just isn't a great rim protector.   I think Randle's athleticism will surprise people on D, especially off-ball. Randle/Eddie Davis/Tarik/Monroe (not to mention LNJ or Upshaw if he makes the team) may not be a bad group for help D."
lakers,3bryea,ocmaddog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:56:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know about Randle, but none of us have proof if he's gotten any better on defense. This is what we know for sure: he's undersized for a PF and he's lost weight. He might be slightly quick, but he'll be outmatched most nights. He's gonna get bullied by guys like Randolph, and he'll be too slow for guys like Lebron who sometimes play PF. As for Monroe, he's not very good. He's going to struggle with the strength that certain centers have (Dwight and DeAndre), and he's too slow to play small ball. Davis and Tarik are good, but they're not going to be starting, and they probably won't at any point in their careers. We need a starting caliber, defensive stud of a center, and Monroe isn't that."
lakers,3bryea,CoolScales,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:25:24 2015 UTC,"Randle is a question mark for sure, and not getting a Defensive C is a risk, but I just don't know who would be better all-around than Monroe at this point.    Zach Lowe with some very kind words for Monroe's D this year: http://pistonpowered.com/2015/01/29/zach-lowe-greg-monroe-deserves-star-consideration/"
lakers,3bryea,ocmaddog,2,Wed Jul 1 23:37:33 2015 UTC,"I get where you're coming from, but I don't think the Lakers need an all around guy, ya know? Look at Mozgov this year. The guy doesn't have range, he's pretty one dimensional offensively, plays good defense, and has good hands. I don't think the Lakers need a C who's looking to score, we need a guy who prides himself on defense. This is what I see happening if Monroe shows up: Randle and Monroe post up on opposite sides of the low post. Russell tries to decide who to pass it to. He chooses Monroe more because he's more polished and is our second highest paid player. We've effectively slowed down the maturation of Randle. It's a small example, but I think it's a good indicator of what would continue to happen if we signed someone like Monroe. A better pick up is Robin Lopez. That's who I'd want mostly."
lakers,3bryea,CoolScales,2,Wed Jul 1 23:49:59 2015 UTC,Technically he's a C but is playing out of position because of Drummond.

lakers,3bsn62,p0se1d0n,-3,Wed Jul 1 20:56:27 2015 UTC,FACT is that no major free agent will sign with the Lakers until Kobe is off this team.   Hopefully Jeanie will keep this in mind if/when Kobe decides to play 1 or 2 more seasons.   Time to move on y'all.
lakers,3bsn62,ashishvp,2,Wed Jul 1 20:55:50 2015 UTC,"We aren't signing any of the marquee players for sure.

lakers,3bsn62,Drawsomeawesome,2,Wed Jul 1 20:57:30 2015 UTC,I dunno about Durant. I'm 99% sure he's either staying in OKC or going to Washington to copy Lebron's homecoming

lakers,3bun4c,PaulKr,2,Thu Jul 2 08:01:32 2015 UTC,"There is always media bias, how much impact it has is another story. Notice how everyone went crazy about the Lakers prior to FA and talked them up like they were a suitable landing spot for players like LMA or DeAndre Jordan. Then when reality set in and people realized that those guys don't want to come to the Lakers because they are rebuilding, everyone starts shitting on the Lakers for how bad their presentation was, Kobe said this, blah blah blah. The Lakers are not good right now, it really that simple, but because they are the most popular franchise in the league reporters gravitate to writing stories and tweets out because it gets the most attention."
lakers,3bun4c,BeefCat10,2,Thu Jul 2 08:05:15 2015 UTC,"You are overestimating the power and the influence of the sports media.  In this day and age, the media is driven by clicks which, of course, will increase advertising revenue and, thus, make money for the media.  What drives clicks to ESPN? Stories about LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and anything to do with the Lakers or even the Knicks.  And there's no surprise that the Lakers and the Knicks are in the two biggest media markets in the United States. And with more people in LA and NYC, there will be more clicks, which-- well, you get the picture.  Therefore, good news or bad, media outlets like ESPN will fly with the story that generates the most clicks. And the ESPN machine is fascinating too.  Guess what. When the Lakers are good again, then there'll be tons of articles praising the Lakers for their smart business practices, how they avoided grenades like Dwight Howard and Carmelo Anthony, how they built through the draft, reinvented themselves, became winners again in the post-Kobe world, and by the way, what does Kobe think about all this?  Next thing you know, it won't be us Lakers fans crying about media bias, it'll be the small markets once again stating: There's the media bias for the Lakers once again.   is it possible there is an agenda to make big market teams like LA and maybe even NY seem less desirable to increase demand and hype for smaller, less popular markets?   There is no way a massive company like ESPN is actively interested in making two massive media markets like LA and NYC less desirable in order to make smaller markets more popular.  Or, to put it another way, massive media outlets like ESPN have little motivation to try and build up smaller media markets.  Whether it's good news or bad news coming from a big media market, it's all good news for guys like ESPN."

lakers,3bt68h,jon_snow_jones,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:16:03 2015 UTC,"That's true. That's why Russell has to prove why he was the 2nd pick, Randle has to prove that he can be a force in the league, and Clarkson develops into Kobe-lite.  I think we should just sign cheap players this offseason, and dedicate the year to developing those three above.   Best case scenario, we get a great core. Worst case, we get a top 3 pick."
lakers,3bt68h,RolloJTomasi,2,Wed Jul 1 23:16:54 2015 UTC,"Worst case, we finish with bottom 3 record, get the 4th pick and it goes to the sixers. I would cry."

The clippers if they lose DJ have to play blake griffin at center, sacramento is a joke. Houston is one harden injury away from being .500. If klay/curry go down for golden state they're screwed as well.        Stay positive, remember 2008? Bynum emerged and we played hard, we werent supposed to get past the first round but we we're dominating and then bynum went down and we traded for pau.

You can't root for the two biggest rivals in the Western Conference. Just like you can't be a Celtics/Lakers fan or a Red Sox/Yankees fan or a Giants/Dodgers fan. They're mutually exclusive. One gains at the other's expense.  Then again, if you're a child then this is excused. Root for whomever is playing before bed time. Children don't know any better yet. I blame the parents."

The Lakers will always be my favorite team, and I would never root for the Spurs to beat the Lakers, but I loved Robert Horry so much, and to see how the Spurs play, it was tough not to like them. Was I pissed when Antonio McDyess tipped that buzzer beater in? Yes. Was I disheartened when they killed us on Easter Day 2010? Extremely. But that doesn't mean I can't like the Spurs.   In any case it's not as bad as rooting for that team from San Diego..."

So you're either 1) a child, 2) a troll looking to antagonize the sub, 3) a non-fan (colloquially referred to as ""a filthy casual"" who doesn't understand how one can't root for enemy teams.

lakers,3btq75,sillymath22,12,Thu Jul 2 01:57:46 2015 UTC,"The Lakers get good again by signing solid/borderline good FA's who are looking for money. By signing them, you increase the talent level while allow your rookies to learn and grow. Re-evaluate the state of the team at the end of each season like always and build on what you accomplished. The goal should be to re-establish the Lakers as being a winning team instead of throw everything but the kitchen sink at a star player. This is a fool's errand and the Lakers need to realize this.  The Lakers allure isn't gone, you just need to give free agents a reason to want to come since you can't outspend everyone else anymore. It's not like it was with Shaq. The Lakers put their balls on the table and no one wanted to pay more than they did. It's not like you have a prime Kobe that you can play with and be good right away. The approach and intended demographic have to change. Once the Lakers are winning again, it'll be much, much easier to sell the franchise to a star player. Until then, this is a hard, embarrassing lesson in futility.  I get that the Lakers would prefer to operate the way they always have. The problem is that the NBA isn't the same that it was even 10 years ago. Things change, people change, and so do their wants and needs. Stars want to compete for a championship, and the Lakers simply aren't selling that this season. The sooner the front office and the fans accept this, the sooner this franchise can get back to being in the hunt for championships."

Now we can't bid any more than any other team, so we have nothing to differentiate ourselves and we have to build through the draft.   In '94, I was biding my time waiting for the day we'd offer a crap-ton of money to Shaq.     Now there's no waiting for the day we can clear the decks and offer LeBron so much money he couldn't say No to us.  We're no different from any other team now, and all we can do is wait and hope Russell and Randle pan out and that we can tank hard enough to keep our pick in 2016 (which allows us to keep our pick in 2018 as well)."

Players want to win they don't care about living in LA because they are rich regardless and can spend their summers there if they want to. The new CBA allows for a level playing field.

lakers,3bsrfx,probotic,2,Wed Jul 1 21:20:56 2015 UTC,"He's a 15/10 guy with potential to get better at a position of need for us. He's undersized and a questionable defender. He's young but not young enough where you'd think his D will get anything but marginally better. I want this guy but not on a max deal, and that's what it's gonna take this offseason to get him I think."
lakers,3bsrfx,jerkidiot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:15:07 2015 UTC,"Forget Greg Monroe. Get a C and a SF who can play defence for God sake. We don't need more scoring, what we need more D! What about Ed Davis?"
lakers,3bsrfx,lemp44,2,Wed Jul 1 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"So you say we should forget about Monroe and get a Center, then proceed to suggest signing a power forward..."
lakers,3bsrfx,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:41:17 2015 UTC,"I used to really believe in acquiring him a few years back but at this point we know what he is and what he can do. He's about to hit his prime and he's remained remarkably, or unremarkably depending on how you look at it, consistent at 15/10 type of guy. That's nothing to sneeze at at all; and in this new type of league we're in seeing a center with numbers like that is noticeable. But overall, he's not someone worth max money. He's someone you bring in as a final piece to complete a roster; not as a cornerstone to build around."
lakers,3bsrfx,Citizen_of_Atlantis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:23:41 2015 UTC,"Your mind is right.   He's good offensively, don't get me wrong. He's no LaMarcus though. He's one of the slowest motherfuckers in the game, he's got no foot speed and no lateral quickness. He's also a very very poor rim protector. He's got a few nice post moves, and very little range. He is a great rebounder however.   He's the kind of guy you sign when you've already got an elite rim protecting center. (oh did I mention Moose plays the 4, and hates playing center?)   He'll be a decent pick-up for a team that's not LA. I'd rather bring Ed back."
lakers,3bsrfx,badguymatt,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:24:56 2015 UTC,"He put up 16/10 in a horribly cluttered front court while playing out of position. He's a good rebounder, great post player and a fantastic passed. Van Gundy also labelled him as the best post defender on the Pistons, although he is not a great rim protector. He's absolutely worth 15 million under the new cap and fit is irrelevant when your team is a bad as ours"
lakers,3bsrfx,Kbmakaveli,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:32:52 2015 UTC,"WE DON'T HAVE A CENTER EXCEPT SACRE IN THE WESTERN CONFERENCE AND WE PASSED ONE UP IN THE DRAFT PARTYLY BECAUSE THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A TON AVAILABLE.  Also, Monroe is underrated here"
lakers,3bsrfx,yungJoc,3,Wed Jul 1 21:18:48 2015 UTC,Mitch passed on Okafor because he believes that Russell will be a superstar
lakers,3bsrfx,Mantis-Toboggin,2,Wed Jul 1 21:25:05 2015 UTC,"Relax, caps lock. Tarik is still with us, and Upshaw could be a steal. Have faith, my dude."
lakers,3bsrfx,Buckelroo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:36:18 2015 UTC,BLEH BLOOP BLEH SOUNDS.  thanks for reminding me about Tarik though.
lakers,3bsrfx,yungJoc,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:39:23 2015 UTC,"AND WE PASSED ONE UP IN THE DRAFT PARTYLY BECAUSE THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A TON AVAILABLE.   LOL  I hope it doesn't happen, but this decision looks even worse today, and will probably continue to look worse as the years roll on.  We could've had Greg Monroe lite (this year) if we'd just drafted Okafor."
lakers,3bu4co,Reddfoxxthepoet,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:12:23 2015 UTC,"no need for a write up, the fact of the matter is that the lakers have nothing to offer players right now to make em contenders for a championship, a lot of the FA's want to win right now something the Lakers can't offer, it sucks but it's that simple, we're just not good enough right now, maybe in the future but not right now"

lakers,3bsymd,lemp44,2,Thu Jul 2 07:17:50 2015 UTC,"Sign Iman Shumpert, re-sign Ed Davis. Defensively we must improve. I know people around here want Tobias Harris, but I don't remember the last time the Lakers ever made an offer to a restricted free agent, so therefore I'd err on the side of they probably wont. We need to fill out the bench and get some veterans other than Mr. Bryant in the locker room too.  PG - Russell  SG - Bryant  SF - Shumpert  PF - Randle  C - Davis  And pray that our rookies play like the all-stars we want them to be."
lakers,3bsymd,duragjones,2,Wed Jul 1 22:07:31 2015 UTC,Thing about Harris tho is that the magic said they won't match
lakers,3bsymd,badguymatt,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:12:45 2015 UTC,"They will now, however. They weren't going to match if Millsap accepted their contract. He's returning to Atlanta though, and there really aren't many better options they can spend their money on. I guess that also depends on how much they like Greg Monroe though."
lakers,3bsymd,tmacgordon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:59:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think signing shumpert is a good idea, he hasn't shown much improvement over his career I'd rather move Clarkson to the 2 and kobe to the 3. Just so we can see what we have."

lakers,3bsymd,Schneeky,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:01:31 2015 UTC,Best Plan B we have right now is signing Harris and Lopez
lakers,3bsymd,Coffee_Transfusion,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:22:31 2015 UTC,Try and get rid of Nick Young.   Take on a salary dump in exchange for picks. Hope Upshaw gets his head straight and sign him. Ed Davis and Shump would be fine.
lakers,3bsymd,arffarffarff,0,Wed Jul 1 22:34:48 2015 UTC,We shall put on our helmets and head back into the tank! Commander  Scott! I await your orders!
lakers,3bsymd,mes8007,-1,Wed Jul 1 23:38:19 2015 UTC,Sign a bunch of waiver/ d leagues guys and keep flexibility. Worse thing you can do is tie urself up with  long-term vet contracts for guys no one wants.. I.E. Nick Young!! Or pistons signing Meeks to a big deal when they couldn't get real talent.
lakers,3bsymd,DAEStephCurryShotWeb,2,Wed Jul 1 22:06:58 2015 UTC,"KD doesn't want to go to a team with a bunch of D-Leaguers and rookies, no max player will want to team up here."
lakers,3bsymd,mes8007,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"We are not getting KD at all.. This summer was our last chance to grab some vet talent for KD. Iman sumpert and kanter either way aren't getting us KD. All they do is restrict our flexibility for other all-star caliber players in future after our young guys have developed for 1-3yrs. Next summer there will be guys like Whiteside, al Jefferson, Drummond, and al hordford available. Getting those guys will be key. And perhaps if we get one of them. We'll be in contention for for Russell Westbrook (Deangelo can play the 2, he is a natural shooter) or Paul George etc a year or so after that."
lakers,3bsymd,mes8007,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:37:53 2015 UTC,"We don't really have a lot of room for error in next years draft. If we tank, we could end up the 4th pick."
lakers,3bpt7i,LowkeyAnushole,20,Wed Jul 1 04:26:26 2015 UTC,"Danny green resigned with San Antonio taking him off the table,  then splitter was traded to Atlanta which means spurs can now offer Aldridge a max contract and that Atlanta can afford to keep Carroll.      Depending on how LaMarcus feels,  we've potentially lost out on LMA,  Danny and Carroll."
lakers,3bpt7i,metrofeed,8,Wed Jul 1 15:58:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's gone.  He has a chance for a title next year, the year after that, and probably the year after that with the Spurs. With us he'd have one rebuilding year, and then a chance IF the team can land another big-ticket FA. Plus the chance to play for Pop, and with the organization that is (for now) the class of the league. Damnit."
lakers,3bpt7i,readem_n_weep,2,Wed Jul 1 19:20:08 2015 UTC,Unfortunately yes. They are currently the class of the league. That has a lot to do with the way they handled Duncan. They kept Pops the whole time.  We let Phil go. Then got him back. Then we didn't get him again when we could.  We went out and just gave Kobe ridiculous money when others were taking less to allow for a better roster. Duncan's legacy hasn't been disrespected but he has been taking less to allow the FO to continue making it work. If anything Duncan has left good memories.   Note: I totally understand this is all in hindsight. This is just an analysis of what has already occurred.
lakers,3bpt7i,spahghetti,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:51:55 2015 UTC,As long as there are the three Buss kids splitting duties it is going to be a shitshow.  It isn't coincidence Lakers are bottomed out after Jerry Buss passed on.  Mitch isn't superman.
lakers,3bpt7i,readem_n_weep,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:53:35 2015 UTC,I totally hear you but we have to keep in mind that his passing coincides with Kobe's aging and injuries. Even with Buss Sr. we had some down times in between teams.  I don't know what to think. I guess we'll eventually see how this all pans out.  Going young and building a team is new to all of us.
lakers,3bpt7i,spahghetti,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:44:05 2015 UTC,"It appears to me that there is not really a person in charge.  It's a committee system that does not involve a strong coach, a manager that is probably very over all of it at this point, and an aged superstar who has far too much gravity to allow for a new start.  It would take someone like Dr. Buss to manage that kind of conundrum."
lakers,3bpt7i,txlonghornfan,10,Sat Jul 4 03:03:58 2015 UTC,Completely agree. All my LMA hype is gone.
lakers,3bpt7i,Null_Hypothesis7,5,Wed Jul 1 16:05:26 2015 UTC,not looking good for us
lakers,3bpt7i,txlonghornfan,5,Wed Jul 1 16:10:55 2015 UTC,Woj: Lakers didn't make strong impression on LMA.
lakers,3bpt7i,LowkeyAnushole,7,Wed Jul 1 16:17:09 2015 UTC,Not surprised.   What could we offer him?  A chance to play out of position and a max contract?  We have a much better Chance with DJ and even that isn't a great chance.
lakers,3bpt7i,readem_n_weep,2,Wed Jul 1 16:34:56 2015 UTC,This is good for us. We have a good core of young players.
lakers,3bpt7i,LowkeyAnushole,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:56:51 2015 UTC,Carroll just signed in Toronto for some reason.

lakers,3bpt7i,yapzilla,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:10:54 2015 UTC,no reds pinks oranges or purples for last names. although violet is a first name i've heard

lakers,3bpt7i,GummiBearMagician,4,Wed Jul 1 05:33:57 2015 UTC,"Looks like Robin Lopez and Biyombo are the only 5's left, we really need a rim protector"
lakers,3bpt7i,Pearberr,10,Thu Jul 2 03:33:45 2015 UTC,"I'm just gonna write my predictions here for later reference.  Gut feeling is that we don't get LMA or DJ - as much as I'm hoping we do.   I find it hard to see LMA saying no to the Spurs to be honest, he would be a great addition to the team but I wouldn't be super bummed if he didn't come to LA, having him interested and linked to the Lakers still shows that despite the bad few seasons we still have heaps of pulling power and that bodes well leading into 2016 free agency.  DJ will most likely stay with the Clips, if not he might head to Dallas. DJ would be a great addition as he is a defensive minded center which we really need however I suspect his offensive game would change a bit (numbers going down) with a change in scenery simply because he won't be catching as many lobs from CP3 and Blake who he both has really good chemistry with.  Now that that's out of the way, I can realistically see us pulling Robin Lopez if our other options don't come to fruition, perhaps even Tyson Chandler. Both are good and solid defensive 5's who will be very handy on the defensive end.  Danny Green may also be an option if the Spurs are focusing on LMA - would be a great addition on the wind (3 and D kind of player) that is very solid and experienced.   Despite all the hype, I am skeptical of our chances of landing a big name this offseason - however I don't think that is particularly a bad thing. With the draft recently over, we have an exciting young core (JC, Randle, Russ) which although might not be super competitive next year, will be exciting to watch and I feel as if this it the best position we have found ourselves in since we last made the playoffs and is very positive leading into the future! Go Lakers! (Feel free to disagree with anything I have put forward, just wanted to see my opinions against other people's)"
lakers,3bpt7i,LowkeyAnushole,3,Wed Jul 1 04:48:12 2015 UTC,I agree with you on everything. I want to believe so bad! But I just can't see any big names coming to the lakers when they fit better on other more competitive teams.
lakers,3bpt7i,jterrance,4,Wed Jul 1 06:11:37 2015 UTC,"Here's an article that breaks down the things that need to happen for the Spurs to sign LMA. TL;DR, it basically reads like a Rube-Goldberg-esque series of events that has to happen; individually they aren't unfeasible, but for all the pieces to fall as they should would be tricky.  If San Antonio were to force the issue, it could mean losing pieces like Splitter and Green (who I wouldn't mind seeing come our way if we're missing out on LMA and DJ).  San Antonio is as cap crunched as we are (maybe more so) except they actually have a good team to show for it."

DJ would be the best option to come here (even though I'm not a fan of his)  but realistically, Robin Lopez and a 3&D wing like Carroll or Danny green (they may both be system players) would be the best haul the Lakers can expect to come out with and I would be extremely happy with that."

Why would LMA worry about being second fiddle to Kobe if he'll have an inside track to being first fiddle after Kobe's done? What could Kobe have possibly said that would be so detrimental to the Laker's pitch? If he wants to contend, why would he look short term with San Antonio's big three on the brink of retirement when he can wait a year and possibly contend for years to come with our young core?  Things just don't add up for me here. If San Antonio gets him, I wouldn't think it's because the Lakers shat the bed unless LMA can't see past what's right in front of his eyes.  Or Byron Scott talked. That's a possibility too. In which case, we're fucked."

The free agents that we would need to turn a 30-35 win team into a title contender aren't going to sign with us as long it's still Kobe's team. Even if Kobe agreed to take a smaller contract and a diminished role in 2016, it will still be his team and that's how it should be until he retires. There's a reason why free agent are avoiding us like a plague, and that's because, unfortunately, there is nothing more unappealing than having Kobe on the books when trying to attract young established talent. Next year is a tribute to Kobe, and a farewell to the best player of my generation. Things will get better, just much more slowly than you're projecting."
lakers,3bvf89,exsisto,0,Thu Jul 2 14:24:45 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying. Let me challenge though.  I don't agree FA's are avoiding us like the plague. We've had meetings with all the top FA's this year. They have at the very least entertained the idea of going Lakers. As unappealing as Kobe may be(debatable), the appeal of playing in LA for the one of the best franchises in all of sports will always be powerfully enticing. The reason we lost out is because our situation isn't attractive at the moment.   That will change with our 30-35 win season and ROY season from Russell. The chemistry was pretty good last year and I expect it get even better. Who's not going to want take over LA with a squad of young talent? Aside from a few howard-like pussies who can't handle the pressure and we don't want anyways , we'll have our serious run at a few greats."
lakers,3bvf89,alldayhangover,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:46:38 2015 UTC,"Unless Kobe can accept a smaller role as an off-the-ball spot up shooter and 2nd / 3rd option, I hope he retires. He will be 37 when this season starts, he is coming off three straight season-ending injuries, and he was completely unimpressive before going out last season with the shoulder injury. And if you don't believe many guys in the NBA don't find him a desirable teammate and that's part of the reason we're having trouble signing free agents, you're kidding yourself. It's past time he give up individual control of the floor."

We missed out on a major FA yes but this is a guy that is entering late career stage soon that wants to win now. With what we have at the moment how can anyone with a functioning brain believe we are going to win immediately. I get it, we are the Lakers, our franchise is suppose to embody winning basketball but people need to calm the fk down and understand this is a rebuilding process. I would love to get LMA too but the fact of the matter is we're not what HE's looking for. Let's just stay patient, build on the young assets we got (Randle, Russel, Clarkson, Black) and in a few years maybe we'll have one of the best young cores in the NBA and we'll talk championships from there. Its a process guys! PS. (Also, for those who are panicking about the vanishing FA's that will not be wearing purple and gold next year, there is a solid young forward that a certain Orlando team will not match max offer to, just putting it out there.)"

lakers,3bsnsw,StealthRUs,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:53:57 2015 UTC,The word is he's a ball stopper on offense and isn't a great defender.  That's why the Magic are willing to let him go if they can't sign him at the right price.

He will only get better but before today everybody was avoiding him like the plague.  Now everybodys freaking out that we didnt get Aldridge or Love.  I've been saying on this sub all along that those targets werent realistic, and I would argue that they werent even best for our franchises sustainability.  Signing this guy to a max contract (15.5mil) is going to be the best thing to happen to our franchise in a long time.  This guy entered the nba at  very young age and was able to make the jump successfully, continously adding more and more to his game.  He's the same age as clarkson, but already has 4 years of nba experience.  Dont give up yet Laker fans, the best thing for our franchise may fall right into our lap!"

He's beginning to approach his prime but he's not going to suddenly morph into Cousins or something. He's a stopgap that won't win us a lot of games.  With Harris, who's a little younger, we still don't know what his ceiling is so he has room to grow.  I also just think it's more likely we can get Harris than Monroe anyway."

For a center I would say that Robin Lopez would be a great solid addition. I just hope sign a good center and don't end up with Hill again.

The situation now is different."

lakers,3bsg5h,TheDenverBroncos,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:27:30 2015 UTC,We still need good value players to trade in the future
lakers,3bsg5h,gumarik,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:53:50 2015 UTC,"I agree in the fact that we should continue to rebuild. But I disagree with the fact that you'd say we're no longer a prime FA destination. There are top guys (DeAndre, LaMarcus) that are giving us the time of day. It's not purely for leverage as some people think, because these guys are going to get a max contract regardless of where they go.   It just so happens that most of the big names this season are either restricted or veterans at this point looking to attach on a contender. There are still good names out there."
lakers,3bsg5h,badguymatt,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:53:52 2015 UTC,"It's not that free agents aren't interested in LA, it's that the past 2 years we have barely had more than max cap space and haven't been able to sign players because that space has been promised to LaMarcus or Carmelo.  We can talk to all these people that have signed today, and I'm sure we have, but we can't offer them a deal until LMA makes his decision.  We wouldn't be a destination if we pulled a max offer after we agreed to let a player think it over and listen to other teams"
lakers,3bsg5h,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:55:30 2015 UTC,"We might be striking out this year, but there will be future opportunities. Right now the Lakers are a very young team and are not yet close to contention. I don't think it is in anyone's best interest if we start locking down some 20mil a year players that are trying to contend now and will get frustrated and leave if we are not at the top of the conference within a couple of years.   We should realize that just because players like LMA don't want to sign with us now doesn't mean we can't haul in a superstar game changer in 2016 or 2017 (and those players WILL be out there). Right now, IMO, we should be signing some quality young players like Greg Monroe or Khris Middleton at affordable prices, then sign a superstar next year with the money that comes off the books when Kobe retires. Once he does, and the other players on our roster are given some time to build some chemistry together and get more experience, THEN we will be a hot destination for FAs."
lakers,3bsg5h,heresdajudge,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:21:58 2015 UTC,"Why would anyone want to come to the Lakers? Even with a big name I am not sure we can make the playoffs. Who is the 9th seed? OKC? And they didn't have KD LOL.  We can't even rebuild properly when we spend so much money on Kobe. I am not saying he doesn't ""deserve"" it, but realize a guy who hasn't played a substantial amount of basketball 3 years in a row is getting $25mil.  Why would LMA come to LA? So he can play with Kobe for one year, who might only play a dozen games again for all we know, not make the playoffs, and then potentially take another 2-3 years to rebuild?  I don't blame Dwight for leaving. Why the fuck would he not? Do you think if he stayed that we would be a good team? We have had Kobe and Nash injured for almost entire seasons.  Strap yourselves in boys, this is going to be a few years. And I'm alright with this."

lakers,3bouve,Jive_turkey82,2,Tue Jun 30 23:15:12 2015 UTC,"The plan has to be for short term deals for less than the max, and then max them out when the cap goes up/kobe comes off the books. Do that and sign someone in 2016 (cough KD cough) and all of a sudden this team is a potential contender."

lakers,3bouve,lars5,2,Tue Jun 30 23:47:41 2015 UTC,"Do you think it's possible that Kobe being there means he's going to promise these guys that if they take a normal one year contract with us, he will promise to take a fat pay cut so they both can re-sign with max deals next year and then they can lure in another major FA and they WILL win a championship all together? I really think Kobe wants a 6th ring. And probably a 7th."

lakers,3bouve,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:32:30 2015 UTC,"Apparently it's possible to get both Jordan and Aldridge for max money, if they incorporate a sign-and trade with Portland. It'll be very hard to pull off though, read on:  From CBA expert Larry Coon's blog: http://cbafaq.com/blog/?p=317   Eric Pincus points out that another scenario is a sign-and trade. If the Lakers kept some of their free agents, they potentially could sign Jordan with their cap room, and then compile enough salary (about $13.8 million) to instrument a sign-and-trade with the Blazers for Aldridge.  Here’s how something like that might work:   The Lakers keep all their players under contract, and do not waive anyone. The Lakers could also keep their Bird rights to Ed Davis (non-Bird), Wayne Ellington (non-Bird), Wes Johnson (Early-Bird), and Ronnie Price (non-Bird). They’d have 13 players spoken for (including Russell), so no additional cap holds. Their total would be about $47.6 million. The Lakers would then sign DeAndre Jordan for $18.8 million, bringing their total to $66.4 million ($700,000 under the cap). The Blazers then sign-and-trade LaMarcus Aldridge to the Lakers for a package that has at least $13.8 million going out. One such package might be Julius Randle (probably necessary in order for the Blazers to bite), Nick Young, Ryan Kelly, Tarik Black, and Wes Johnson, who is signed for close to the average salary as an Early-Bird free agent in a sign-and trade. Since this would trigger the base year compensation rule, Johnson’s salary would count only 50 percent in the trade.   Also a pretty unlikely scenario, but a possible one.  UPDATE #2: I corrected some numbers in the original post caused by my fat fingers on my calculator."

lakers,3bouve,ReallyGoodUsername,0,Tue Jun 30 23:28:27 2015 UTC,"You know your franchise has seen dark days if your fanbase is thrilled by the idea of overpaying DeAndre Jordan. I swear, if that guy leaves the Clippers, his value will plummet. Almost all of his production on offense is a result of the attention on CP3/Blake and their playmaking ability.   Who is going to demand that attention for us? A 37-year-old Kobe Bryant in his final season? One of our inexperienced guards? Even if we add LMA, he'll wind up away from the paint and less effective than he could be down low. Our roster wont come close to matching the Clippers' since they have two of the top-7 offensive players in the league.   I understand the value of rebounding and rim protection, but you cant offer a max contract (or a pseudo max contract) to a 27-year-old who can't do anything else, especially when your team is missing the other pieces to compensate for him on the offensive side of the ball."

Today's players don't care too much about the rearview mirror (Laker legacy, business opps, media market, etc) - they're looking through the windshield and teammates that will help together, not in a deferring role - and social media renders larger markets almost irrelevant (KD in OKC).  I wasn't a fan of the LaMarcus recruitment - but he clearly wanted to be valued as a baller and a piece of a team, if he wanted media opps and other business ventures, it would have happened already.  Gawd I'm frustrated - I'd rather we struck out detailing our BASKETBALL plan, not stupid sizzle glitz and cliche sounding pitches that would have worked in the 80s.  Gah dammit."

lakers,3bpzxy,mexicanborderlands,-9,Wed Jul 1 08:22:41 2015 UTC,"Over just like that? Ya, he aint coming. Probably for the best. I think dj should be the focus. Younger and can grow with the core we have."
lakers,3bstf3,Riles26,3,Wed Jul 1 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"Our FO needs to catch up with the times with analytics and managerial methods etc. That old Showtime Jerry Buss style worked for its time but we need to evolve and be at the forefront of basketball culture like before. Jeanie, Byron, Jim, Mitch, seem too old school to be very effective"
lakers,3bstf3,Yestromo,4,Wed Jul 1 21:49:06 2015 UTC,The Celtics & Knicks are 2 other franchises in this league with an insane legacy (like ours.) and they don't have max-level players showing up at their doorsteps either.   It'll happen in due time. We've got an extremely exciting young core to be ecstatic about anyways.
lakers,3bstf3,badguymatt,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:28:35 2015 UTC,And we're way better off than the Celtics and Knicks too
lakers,3bstf3,Mantis-Toboggin,-11,Wed Jul 1 21:34:22 2015 UTC,Umm no your not the celtics win 30+ games yall didn't even get to 20 maybe yall are worse at knicks
lakers,3bstf3,OnePieceAce,3,Wed Jul 1 21:35:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that we aren't as successful as the Celitics right now, but did you just say we are worse than the Knicks? Lol"
lakers,3bstf3,Shogun_36,2,Wed Jul 1 21:37:02 2015 UTC,"Because their first round pick didn't get hurt the 1st game of the season. Who's their core? Smart, Crowder, and Sullinger? Hardly anything to be excited about. Don't even get me started on how bad the Knicks are going to be the next 8 years. How about you go troll some other teams sub?"
lakers,3bstf3,Mantis-Toboggin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:40:14 2015 UTC,"Knicks have melo, which make them better. But we have a better long term plan with flexibility and youth hope in place. Just have to give Deangelo and Randle time to put in work. Hopefully they prove to be legit. And if they do, everything changes."

lakers,3bstf3,sunjolol,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:03:54 2015 UTC,Aldridge will be 30 by the time next season starts. This Lakers squad wouldn't be a contending playoff team for at least another 2 or 3 years. Aldridge will be 32 or 33 and most likely on the decline. He wants to win now and join a contending team. You can't blame him for wanting to win. Kevin Love is not leaving a team with LeBron and Kyrie and Jimmy Butler isn't passing up a chance to be the guy for Chicago especially after that season he had. The Lakers need to be patient and develop the youth they have and continue to look for solid short-term deals like they did last year as they prepare for Kobe's contract to come off the books.
lakers,3bstf3,thekobesystem8,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:41:24 2015 UTC,"Players in their prime wanting to win a championship don't sign with rebuilding, lottery bound teams. What do you want the front office to tell these guys?"

Of course when when sign guys or rookies, they'll mention the legacy, becuz its the laker way. But guys don't care about history. History won't win them anything.

lakers,3bov8t,Ksanti,3,Wed Jul 1 10:29:03 2015 UTC,"Because Randle was our first round pick and he's projected to have real potential to be a top franchise player. JC while he was a massive steal in the draft and played brilliantly in last season's shitshow, is just a pretty good guard in a league absolutely stacked with guard talent."
lakers,3bov8t,muffhug,2,Wed Jul 1 12:27:17 2015 UTC,"That's true but those are just draft positions and we all know how meaningless they can be. Smart and Exum were guards that were drafted even before Randle so they must have been considered to be top level/franchise player talent but JC outplayed them in much less games and was even gaining momentum. I really hope Randle lives up to the hype, but there's no more ""hype"" around JC. He's proven himself and I cant wait to see what he can do next season"
lakers,3bov8t,javi2123,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:21:38 2015 UTC,"JHill under the radar too. He is great also because he's a like a bulldog. He can be the nicest person, but once he steps in the paint he becomes a relentless force. I am a huge fan of Hill because of his work ethic. He was really focused last season and its apparent in his build. The man was in shape and ready to win. Whatever the Lakers offer him I hope he is happy because he deserves at least that much for sticking with us."

Maybe even waste a roster spot on him blocking the path of a young, healthy player who could be a diamond in the rough?  Still yes?  Then let's add Bynum's well-documented unprofessionalism too.

But he's unproven, so I'm hesitant about the Lakers giving him $15 million.  If he continues to develop, he'll be a steal.  If he stagnates, he's an albatross contract."

lakers,3bthsz,mes8007,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:45:39 2015 UTC,Orlando is stupid if they don't max him. We need one good center to guard the bench for us while versatile guys like Harris who can play the 3 or 4 are out there lighting it up for us. Or we get khawi. As fast as the ufa's are signing we'll be getting down to business with Harris of Khawi in no time.

lakers,3botpp,WestsideMoonWalker,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:56:33 2015 UTC,"When he said won't have the room, he meant $$. It came out earlier that even if we had only Kobe and Russell on the roster we wouldn't have the money to sign 2 max players this offseason."
lakers,3botpp,KeiserSoze24,5,Wed Jul 1 14:26:00 2015 UTC,DeAndre is not worth max...
lakers,3botpp,lolxddavid,0,Wed Jul 1 00:15:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe not for this year, but after the cap jumps next year, his contract would look at a lot better.   Edit: I don't think that contract would ever look good, but for max money, you could certainly do worse."
lakers,3botpp,_im_on_acid_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:29:28 2015 UTC,Please leave Dj out of this team. Max contract for a very limited offensive player and can't shoot free throws.
lakers,3botpp,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:42:32 2015 UTC,Unload Russell and Randle......... but that's what I would've said if I was a Lakers hater.
lakers,3botpp,LeBaconator,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:33:39 2015 UTC,"Sacre is probably gone, Jabari too.  Might have to include Black in a deal to dump Swaggy"
lakers,3botpp,TimeisIllmatic95,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:03:37 2015 UTC,Sacre is going no where. His contract is under 1 mil and it's guaranteed as of today. Jabari is on a cheap non-guaranteed contract as well. Don't see him being traded as he could help our bench w/ his scoring.
lakers,3botpp,justbringitbitch,-1,Wed Jul 1 03:23:26 2015 UTC,"DeAndre at Max and Harris at 4yr 40mil, possibly backload it to keep Ed Davis"
