twinpeaks,3c3dwv,Mikeoneus,7,Sun Jul 5 04:00:50 2015 UTC,"I watched Twin Peaks for the first time recently so I understand your thinking pretty well. Things get incredibly tedious for a while once the killer is apprehended, but, gradually, another mostly interesting plot is introduced as you approach the end. Initially it sits awkwardly in thr the background as soap opera bullshit takes centre stage, but it shifts into focus more as time goes on. For my money it never fully recovers but the final couple of episodes are much better than the really shit ones."
twinpeaks,3c3dwv,ForeverxJoker,3,Sat Jul 4 12:45:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah after some bs soap opera romance episodes with boring characters, there is another great plot introduced. Near the end it gets more David Lynch"

twinpeaks,3c3dwv,princesa-real,2,Sat Jul 4 22:34:33 2015 UTC,Thank you! I think I can handle it as long as it's not very Donna/James heavy. They tire and bore me.
twinpeaks,3c3dwv,princesa-real,2,Sun Jul 5 01:39:41 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. In a show where my eyes are glued to the question of ""Who killed Laura Palmer"", Donna and James come along and make me fall asleep. I suppose they got slightly more interesting when they were looking for clues but it's so hard to watch them at times."
twinpeaks,3c1ojz,aselectionofcheeses,16,Fri Jul 3 23:05:18 2015 UTC,"Those season 2 episodes are... well, it just seems like they are dragging it out. I don't dislike them entirely, but they feel like a very seperate thing. I think it should have ended when laura's killer is revealed. The episodes after that just try too hard to be weird, until the end when Lynch came back and tidied it up a little."
twinpeaks,3c1ojz,Chewlip,5,Sat Jul 4 01:15:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with you mostly, but if the series ended right after the killer is revealed we would have missed out on some excellent moments. the finale is one of the greatest episodes of television ever and makes the shitty episodes worth it."

Windom Earle is a fantastic character, the beauty pageant subplot was cute, and I liked seeing Cooper get some character development. The only thing I didn't like (besides James' big adventure) was Billy Zane's character. Even though I liked seeing Cooper falling in love, it should have been with Audrey dammit."
twinpeaks,3c1ojz,MeanAmbrose,8,Sat Jul 4 02:34:46 2015 UTC,I liked it all. I'd heard complaining on Reddit about the second season but I still loved it.

twinpeaks,3c1ojz,rockmandash,6,Sat Jul 4 01:19:55 2015 UTC,"Earle is a good idea for a villain, and he's great at giving the narrative a driving force again (since it just meanders for ages after the Laura storyline is wrapped up).   But, he's far too silly with zero menance. His speeches are silly, and this wouldn't be a problem, but, considering how much fear Cooper expresses at the idea of Earle showing up .. it's just lame to see him so .. lame! Not to mention that in the story of Twin Peaks, what, 3 or so people die in the first season and a half? Windom Earle's storyline (based off memory) has more than that die in half the amount of episodes .. it just becomes ludicrous."
twinpeaks,3c1ojz,LittleRudiger,4,Sat Jul 4 09:35:57 2015 UTC,I agree. I actually skip the James story line.
twinpeaks,3c1ojz,19mine,3,Sat Jul 4 13:03:54 2015 UTC,"The first time I watched through the show, I was so mesmerized by every little thing that basically every episode was perfect for me. Upon rewatches, the second half of season 2 becomes more like a parody of itself rather than a natural progression of what TP was before. I don't necessarily think it gets ""too weird,"" but it becomes a lot more like Lynch's movie Wild at Heart, which has a tone that makes you feel like you're watching a giant self-referential joke made into a movie. The sideplots that happen to most of the characters seem to make them less multi-dimensional (Ben is crazy, Audrey is a minx, James is a dork, etc.).  That being said, I still love every second of the show. I suffer from a strong case of intellect vs. emotion: I acknowledge that it got different in a bad way after solving the murder, but I don't let that make me enjoy the show less."

twinpeaks,3c1ojz,burntfishnchips,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:40:39 2015 UTC,"I feel like the show was just way ahead of its time. If it was allowed to exist as 8 episode seasons nowadays, it would probably be extremely popular on services like Netflix. Just that back then seasons were expected to be 22-26 episodes long. Most shows got around it by having a weekly procedural gimmick. It's just not possible to sustain interesting stories for every character for that long a period of time.   The Laura Palmer tragedy was perfect because it impacted everyone in the town in some way. David Lynch never wanted the mystery to be solved anyway..."

twinpeaks,3by1xu,ghostworldvhs,9,Fri Jul 3 02:37:15 2015 UTC,"I absolutely adored the film.  That's probably because I felt the show was at its best whenever exploring the mythology of Twin Peaks, and that's mostly what Fire Walk With Me is about.  I do agree that you need to be a fan of Twin Peaks to appreciate it.  There is such a complex world surrounding the show, and the movie does nothing to simplify it.  If anything, it complicates it even more."
twinpeaks,3by1xu,ElectricMarmalade,4,Fri Jul 3 03:11:17 2015 UTC,"""Fire Walk With Me"" aside, what do you mean ""take seriously""?   There are multiple ways to enjoy David Lynch, but being too invested taking things seriously could be very limiting. So much of Lynch is dependent on absurdity and irony, and part of what makes him great is his ability to strike balance between seemingly contradictory elements.   Here's an example:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji_K99Ff5tE  There's an absurd moment soaked in melodrama, that still informs about the characters and generates emotional affect, despite having little connection to reality. Things don't necessarily need to feel real to have narrative purpose and emotional pull, and in fact the unreal is the defining characteristic of Lynch's work."
twinpeaks,3by1xu,organizesubredditscl,0,Fri Jul 3 03:44:04 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying, and yes Lynch does a great job with that. It is not that I don't appreciate the absurd moments. The absurd and surreal elements of the show were what made me love it so much. I think maybe I appreciated the build up that you had to those very surreal scenes in the series. I would look forward to them. In the movie there just seemed to be so much more of the surreal going on, but it's all great. I just can't help thinking what a person who watched FWWM and only FWWM would think."
twinpeaks,3by1xu,LostInTheMovies,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:33:27 2015 UTC,"Surprisingly, in my experience they often like it more (well, except for the person right below this haha) because they aren't bringing expectations from the show. And if they are into Lynch, a lot of the weird stuff just seems like typical Lynchian surrealism and doesn't need any explanatory backstory (the one-armed man and little guy are no more confusing than, say, the Creature Behind the Dumpster in Mulholland Drive). In fact, I think non-series viewers tend to take the film more seriously than the average series viewer. They see it as being more about an abused girl's psychological state than tying together loose ends of the mythology and Twin Peaks plot."
twinpeaks,3by1xu,swingsetlife,3,Sat Jul 11 01:35:15 2015 UTC,"I LOVE FWWM, and I saw the film first, so it was just this nightmare that I didn't understand at all. Now I thoroughly appreciate it for what it was. And since the release of the 90 minutes of deleted scenes I appreciate it that much more!"
twinpeaks,3by1xu,Bardaf,2,Fri Jul 3 03:29:55 2015 UTC,"Some parts just seemed laughable    Sheryl Lee's wig ? Yep.  But there are so many great things in the movie.  Lots of clarifications (IMO) about the relation between Bob and Leland, more aspects of the fucked up life Laura had, also, boobs.  The real lack of the movie is that we don't see a lot of characters and I really miss them, but it was cut and really different from what was intended at first, the deleted scenes that you can watch in the blu ray show that they all were around in the first version."
twinpeaks,3by1xu,IcedThatGuy,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:29:59 2015 UTC,"I completely get what you are saying. After the relatively straight-forwardness of Twin Peaks, going right in to Fire Walk With Me, is jarring, uncomfortable, and unsatisfying. I felt the exact same way.  I binge-watched the show in a week after starting it up on a whim. I fell in love with the show, it's characters, and it's atmosphere. After finishing, I desperately tried to find an online free version (I was super poor) and watched the movie immediately after the show. I can describe for you the amount of disappointment I experienced. It gave absolutely no answers, made little sense, the acting felt 'off', and most importantly, very little Cooper. The change in actresses for Donna definitely confused me. It was just weird.  I started showing my girlfriend (now wife) the show and she fell in love with it. It sucked because I knew the inevitable end would be coming pretty soon. This time I bought the Bluray ( I wanted that extra unreleased footage!) and tried to explain what she was about to experience. We are both Lynch fans, and loved Mulholland Drive, so I made as many comparisons as I could.  Upon rewatching, I found the movie to be outstanding! After doing a ton of research since the first watch and perusing the show again, I found Fire Walk With Me to answer a lot of questions. Sheryl Lee's acting is really pretty phenomenal, and she gives life to a bleak and sad story. Moira Kelly, to me, was perfect as Donna, as she portrays a Donna that is more innocent and without the cynicism Laura's Death inspires in her. The answers this film gives are not obvious, and hang just below the surface, in the film's odd dialogue. The Twin Peaks Wiki is an invaluable resource.  TL;DR: Rewatch it. It is so much better after researching a bit into the show's mythology. Also understand that David Lynch builds a puzzle with his stories, that you have to pick apart with a fine-tooth comb."

twinpeaks,3bxsys,punkqueen,6,Fri Jul 3 01:14:07 2015 UTC,How is it the same plot structure? Episode 7 is airing right now and it really isn't similar to TP at all other than 'small pacific northwest town' and some mystery which they have already started to explicitly explain.  I don't like it nearly as much as Twin Peaks but its interesting enough. Much closer to The Prisoner than TP but as time goes on even those similarities are fading away.
twinpeaks,3bxsys,PaulCoffee77,2,Fri Jul 3 01:39:23 2015 UTC,Okay so fun fact: I'm literally an idiot. I don't want TV very much and I saw a trailer for it and for some reason I thought it was premiering tonight?? Just from the trailer and a few reviews I read online from like actual critics (I figured they see it early like film critics do??) I thought it was suuuuper similar to TP. My mistake!
twinpeaks,3bxsys,PaulCoffee77,3,Fri Jul 3 03:14:25 2015 UTC,Haha no worries. Give it a try you might like it. It is at least trying to be unique and well made and thats more than you can say for most TV.
twinpeaks,3bxsys,underthesign,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:31:12 2015 UTC,"I have to respectfully disagree with you completely. To me it's not trying to do anything new whatsoever. It's borrowing (putting it mildly. Stealing would be more accurate) incredibly heavily from Twin Peaks, X-Files, Lost, The Truman Show and Pleasantville and many more. The dialog is absolutely atrocious and the plot is extremely thin. Even the acting is sub-par. I've given up on it after about 4 episodes. The comparisons to Twin Peaks are totally valid IMO but this comes nowhere near in terms of quality. Disappointing to say the least."

Therefore, I like to imagine the area is pretty large, making the population so high by default, but that the actual ""downtown"" area of Twin Peaks is pretty small comparatively."
twinpeaks,3bw1dn,Iswitt,3,Thu Jul 2 16:51:53 2015 UTC,They had to put 50.000 on the sign by command/request of the network. Frost and Lynch always imagined it as a 5.000 village - this is why it feels like that.

Evidently it was supposed to come out on the PS2, but since it was so similar in nature to the show, the developers had to delay the release and it ended up on the 360 (with later releases on PC and PS3). . Also, fun fact. The grocery store from the game called the Milk Barn is a real place in the Snoqualmie, WA area. I saw it while I was at the 2014 Fest."

twinpeaks,3bnbzj,Lucan541,7,Tue Jun 30 20:24:21 2015 UTC,Alan Wake is half Twin Peaks and half Stephen King novel. I greatly enjoyed it.

twinpeaks,3bnbzj,RiseAnShineMrFreeman,7,Tue Jun 30 21:32:45 2015 UTC,it's certainly a bit of a love letter.
twinpeaks,3bnbzj,sleepybrett,3,Tue Jun 30 18:51:44 2015 UTC,The diner in the first act I'm pretty sure is a near-exact replica of the Double-R.  There are some characters that are direct parallels to people in twin peaks but that would veer into spoiler territory.
twinpeaks,3bnbzj,georgefrankly,3,Tue Jun 30 21:20:08 2015 UTC,"I'm not very far in, but it's definitely heavily based on Twin Peaks from what I've seen of the characters alone. Police station looks kinda similar, too."

twinpeaks,3bnbzj,douko,2,Wed Jul 1 01:50:50 2015 UTC,"The previous games by the developer, Max Payne 1 and 2, were also littered with Twin Peaks references. For example, there is a pink flamingo that often appears in dream sequences out of an in-game show called Address Unknown (the shows in Max Payne 2 play out a form of symbolic parallel with the game's story, much like Invitation to Love in Twin Peaks) which uses the exact reversed voice effect as the Man in the Black Lodge.  Alan Wake is a little more blatant. The aspects of the game that aren't pretty much exactly The Dark Half by Stephen King are directly out of Twin Peaks. The Lamp Lady=The Log Lady, the diner, the locale, etc.   All in all, I think they did a great job at capturing the Lynch feel in a video game and Twin Peaks continues to expand its influence in the direction of storytelling in games, a trend which probably started with Link's Awakening, but hopefully ends never.  Edit: Accidentally typed Link to the Past instead of Link's Awakening"

twinpeaks,3bf2v8,extraflux,6,Sun Jun 28 20:43:43 2015 UTC,"Fair warning, because this is my field. This image is 96dpi, which will give a shitty, shitty digital print. Even on it's best day it will have a ""fakey"" look to it. Grainy up close if it's too large or you have to have it super small, and then it's super obvious that it's a fake.  I tried looking for something a bit higher quality, but I could only find a 100dpi image - which is not much better.  My advice, not that you asked for it, but it's free - have it done on something high gloss, the shine will distract from the artefacts, and then put it in the most pedestrian frame you can.

twinpeaks,3bf2v8,Foroma,2,Tue Jun 30 19:34:13 2015 UTC,"Despite being a large picture, this is 109dpi. I would advise my customer against trying anything fancy with this. People have a predisposition to equate size with quality. Especially with images. How large were you looking to have this done?  If you're serious about doing this, get it gallery wrapped so it folds over the edge, beware that ""giclee"" print means printed on an inkjet (a nice one, but same tech) and don't go too large and resize in spec and you might do okay.  But then again, you might waste $100 doing that.  Most office supply stores (Staples et al) have print and copy centers where you can send stuff away and it's not horribly expensive, but they may give you a hard time about you not being the copyright owner on an image you're trying to get digitally reproduced."

It was also the first David Lynch film I ever saw and the first movie that convinced me that film could be art. Up until that point I was a fairly sheltered and naive 15 year old, so I never had really seen much outside of your typical contemporary fare.    As we watched my brother and his friend giggled throughout most of the film but I was totally spellbound. For the entire length of the movie I sat enraptured after watching surrealistic scene after surrealistic scene.  I spent the entirety of that evening trying to figure out exactly what I had just watched and began reevaluating film as a medium.  Immediately afterwards I began watching all the David Lynch movies I could find at the local rental stop and began to delve into classics like Citizen Kane, The Seventh Seal and so on. Years later I even got to watch the TV series (it was difficult to find recordings in the 90’s) and the spoiler that FWWM was did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the show.    I realize that FWWM wasn't the film that diehard fans were expecting when it hit theaters in 1992. But for me it will always be THE Movie, even if for sentimental reasons."

Put the DNS into your tablet and it will work. I use unlocator.com on my Sony smart TV and Fire TV stick. They also have a free trial period so you can see if its for you or not. I think someone on reddit has one thats even cheaper but I forget the name.

She lives with her mom):  I have only seen it once and that was in the theatre I guess it premiered in '91?  I remember it being pretty scary?  She's fifteen do you think that it's too much for her?   You know I've always felt that David Lynch's films were terrifying.   Or at least a couple of scenes in each of his films are creaking so scary.  I just watched inland empire again and it freaked me out!
twinpeaks,3b1qng,slackingatlazyboy,3,Thu Jun 25 15:32:58 2015 UTC,"Ohh okay, the picture is from that.  Yeah I'd say it's scarier than the show.

I'd compare it to Mulholland Drive in that respect."

It's far darker than the show, but so it should be given that it follows the last days of Laura Palmer. It's also missing some key characters, and didn't resolve the show's cliffhangers, which drew criticism.  Please watch it and make up your own mind."
twinpeaks,3b15yq,PeterOHanra,8,Thu Jun 25 11:30:33 2015 UTC,"Not very good? It's fantastic. Some of Lynch's most effective stuff in that film.  Critics didn't like it because it was very different tonally from the show. If you loved Lost Highway, I see no reason you wouldn't feel the same way about FWWM. Critics didn't really like LH, either."
twinpeaks,3b15yq,FloydPink24,3,Thu Jun 25 13:34:13 2015 UTC,"I think that FWWM suffered from people really wanting more of the story from after the Series Finale, which is not what the movie covers at all.  Now that Season 3 is on the horizon, I think it's probably possible for a first time viewer to not have any of that post-finale story desire color their experience of the film, and be able to enjoy the prequel for what it is (instead of dislike it for what it is not)."
twinpeaks,3b15yq,wharpua,7,Thu Jun 25 13:48:23 2015 UTC,"You should watch it, as it is considered canon for the new episodes. Actually, I hope to see quite a few characters from the film return in 2016."

twinpeaks,3b15yq,Cockrocker,3,Thu Jun 25 14:26:18 2015 UTC,"Do not watch the fan-edit of the movie as some have suggested. The Missing Pieces are very interesting to a Twin Peaks fan but it ruins the suspense, making the film even more disjointed.  I've watched FWWM twice in the last month. Initially I didn't like it because I was desperate for more Twin Peaks craziness. What I got was much more akin to Lost Highway, a very dark and sinister film and this initially left me hating the movie. When I watched it again a few weeks later I enjoyed it much more knowing what I was in for and besides a few issues I had with the ending it was thoroughly enjoyable."
twinpeaks,3b15yq,Confused_Shelf,3,Thu Jun 25 15:21:44 2015 UTC,"Frost said that FWWM will definitely factor into the continuation of the show. It's a relief to hear him say this, as i'd imagine there'd be huge incentive to gear the show towards the casual viewer who watched the show when it was a fad and drifted onto the next thing soon after. The majority of the audience are going to be these people, so you'd almost understand if Lynch and Frost aimed it more towards them (luckily, Lynch doesn't tend to give a shit what people want, but Showtime are ponying up the money and there's got to be some kind of understanding, i'd imagine, that he's not just going to make an INLAND EMPIRE with their cash).  FWWM was not as well-known as the show, but it's a continuation of it, it is most definitely canon and it also kicks things up a gear, showing us what was behind the facade of Twin Peaks. It's Twin Peaks at its best. It's weird and kind of a shame that people who're discovering the show can even think that watching the film is optional. I mean, it's the beginning of everything. If you like the show, why on earth would you not watch it? Even if you didn't enjoy it, it's still telling more of the story. There were crap episodes of the show, but no one skips them (at least the first time through; on a rewatch I would definitely recommend a few skips).  Certainly you could make skip it and things would still make sense. But you'd lose a shit ton of context, and you'd miss out on some brilliant FBI background stuff, as well as seeing Laura Palmer alive through an actually stunning performance by Sheryl Lee.   TL;DR: you could skip the film, but if you enjoy the story Twin Peaks is telling, why on earth would you do so?"
twinpeaks,3b15yq,IvanLyon,2,Thu Jun 25 19:01:20 2015 UTC,"Actually, on the Laura Palmer thing, one of the specific criticisms I've heard is that Laura becomes a really uninteresting character when the story is actually about her. Is there any truth to that? The acting can be stellar and still produce a middling character."
twinpeaks,3b15yq,IvanLyon,2,Thu Jun 25 19:14:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say she's all that interesting as a character; she's just what she's described as in the show, really. The good girl who everyone loves, but she has a dark side. She's just the focal point for all the stuff that's going on. But it's definitely interesting to actually see the living Laura for once. What happens to her in FWWM is horrific and Lee portrays this very well. The character may not be as fleshed out as some would want, but you're certainly not going to be bored. She doesn't appear until about forty minutes in, so you get plenty of FBI storyline, which is the best part of FWWM, really, and expands on the Black Lodge mythos.   It's absolutely the high point of Twin Peaks (if you're interested in the actual story as opposed to just the ambience and kookiness of the TV show - which is OK, this is the attraction for lots of people) and you'll be worse off for not having watched it at least once."

twinpeaks,3b15yq,Kindan,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:27:41 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I thought she was boring during the show because she just seemed like an object that everyone either was upset about or interested in her mystery. The movie makes her seem like a person and gives you a glimpse into what was actually happening in her mind and let's you see all the sides of her very complicated personality, which aids in understanding why so many people in the show thought of her in so many different ways. As the model student, the involved member of the community, the coke addict, the cheating girlfriend, the prostitute, so on. It's really interesting to see how she really was all of those people at once acted out in front of you on the screen."
twinpeaks,3b15yq,Shloog,5,Fri Jun 26 23:54:47 2015 UTC,"Not much is revealed in FWWM that isn't just filling in some blanks to the Laura Palmer mystery. But, the end does extend on the final scene of the shows finale, kinda giving an idea as to where the show might pick up from. If you want you should look for the Q2 fan-edit of the film that adds in the Missing Pieces scenes, saw it recently and thought it was fantastic."

The Missing Pieces is fine as a seperate supplement.  Also, Fire Walk With Me is excellent. The people who don't like it are usually just upset that it is so tonally different from the show. It's basically a horror movie.  So watch Fire Walk With Me, then watch the Missing Pieces, and then if the mood strikes you watch the Q2 edit"

twinpeaks,3b15yq,callmecatalyst,2,Thu Jun 25 18:11:29 2015 UTC,"Fire Walk With Me is David Lynch's Horror masterpiece and one of his five best movies (difficult but it's right there with Wild at Heart and Lost Highway). It's by far his most terrifying movie, and I think a lot of the criticism it received was due to it not wrapping up or being anything like the series. Now that we know it's not the final word, I bet it's even better.   Side Note: I kind of hate Tarantino for saying FWWM was Lynch going too far up his own ass. I dig his pictures but Quentin Tarantino should NEVER accuse anyone of going too far up their own ass (although that was in the 90's. I bet modern day Tarantino would never say that)."

twinpeaks,3avbhv,ziggykareem,7,Tue Jun 23 20:34:08 2015 UTC,You may be relieved to know that your experience echoes precisely the sentiment those of us who watched it on first airing. The ratings depicted this mid-2nd-season slide very clearly.

twinpeaks,3avbhv,Confused_Shelf,4,Tue Jun 23 23:53:28 2015 UTC,Episodes 17-23 are well known for being poorly received. Few here will tell you those aren't the worst sequence of episodes the show has.  However just about everyone agrees that it picks back up and the ending to the show is staggering; the best bit of Twin Peaks there is.
twinpeaks,3avbhv,Confused_Shelf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:16:03 2015 UTC,I just checked my Netflix and we're on episode 15... so you have not particularly excited me to finish and slog through 17-23.  I do think the last 2-3 eps we watched picked up a little bit for us.  Still planning to finish in time to watch the new series!
twinpeaks,3avbhv,Confused_Shelf,-1,Tue Jun 23 20:19:07 2015 UTC,Episode 15 is the episode where the killer is revealed. So if I'm not mistaken you haven't actually watched any more since you found out who did it.  If the murderers identity bummed you out that much then perhaps it's just best to leave it at that.  You say the last 2-3 were getting better so were you already disinterested before the reveal?
twinpeaks,3avbhv,Confused_Shelf,2,Tue Jun 23 20:23:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry; bit of a nomenclature confusion.  I meant Season 2 ep 15 rather than ep 15 overall.  In total episode count we're ready to start episode 23... so maybe we're through the ""duller"" section!  Woo!"
twinpeaks,3avbhv,EdgarsTeethAreDry,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:27:21 2015 UTC,"Oh right.  Well in that case you're almost (if not already) through the worst bits.  Without giving away anything, have you got to ""that"" scene with Josie yet? You'll know if you have. That is the turning point where the show regains focus and starts building towards the spectacular finale."
twinpeaks,3avbhv,coffeencreme,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:30:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go with... no.  but now I'm intrigued again!  Thanks for the honest advice/feedback on the show's doldrums, wasn't sure if I'd get a response other than ""Twin Peaks is the best all the time forever."""
twinpeaks,3apjp6,TodosLosLuces,7,Mon Jun 22 13:34:25 2015 UTC,"All of my friends had a hard time getting into the pilot. Like all 5 people I had watch it took time to get into it. But me? I don't know what it was, but I was instantly captivated. Just the mood and the music and the offbeat dialogue and the world, I was immediately hooked for life."
twinpeaks,3apjp6,Baba_Ganoush_Big_Guy,5,Mon Jun 22 17:17:53 2015 UTC,"I knew this sounds weird, I only watch twin peaks when it's dark and rainy. On a ""nice day/ night"" I can't get into the show. It helps the feeling of the show"
twinpeaks,3apjp6,nvrgnaletyadwn,8,Mon Jun 22 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"I had the same experience.  It took me 2 or 3 times of watching the first episode to even bother to continue on.  But once I did, it was definitely worth it.  Eventually, if your experience is like mine, you'll come to love and hate some of the characters so much that going back and re-watching the first episode will be a totally different experience.    Also, it doesn't really start getting weird until the third episode.  So I'd say that you just haven't gotten to the stuff that your friends (probably rightly) think that you'll love."
twinpeaks,3apjp6,pm_me_ur_garmonbozia,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:55:56 2015 UTC,Same here. I started the pilot the first time like 6 years ago. I'm finally finishing the series this week. It's so worth it.
twinpeaks,3apjp6,0bazooka0,1 point,Tue Jun 23 03:18:38 2015 UTC,Thanks so much. Up until now I was under the impression the whole of the internet thought the pilot was flawless. I'll keep it up :)

twinpeaks,3apjp6,GSV-Culture,7,Mon Jun 22 23:01:51 2015 UTC,"IIRC, when I watched it I almost gave up halfway through the pilot, then Coop showed up and started being Coop and I was hooked."
twinpeaks,3apjp6,Voduar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:00:43 2015 UTC,"The good news is you are on one of the subs I've found to be surprisingly receptive to reasonable criticisms. The pilot does very well in hindsight/multiple viewings as they setup a lot more than you think. However, I can see it being too laid back/half-asleep for some people to engage with."
twinpeaks,3apjp6,Thelonious_Cube,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:54:50 2015 UTC,It's not so much that it's flawed as that it's sort of a Trojan Horse for mainstream TV viewers of the time.
twinpeaks,3apjp6,arachnophobia-kid,3,Mon Jun 22 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"I dug the pilot almost immediately. By the time we meet Cooper in that episode Twin Peaks had become solidified as one of my favourite shows. That being said, I can imagine why this show could throw someone for a loop.   For what it's worth I encourage you to keep watching, it may not be the most accessible show but it is extremely creative and thought provoking. If you think you'd enjoy a whodunit with eccentric characters and a bunch of fantastical elements then you'll probably end up enjoying Twin Peaks in the long run."
twinpeaks,3apjp6,naylord,3,Mon Jun 22 20:37:16 2015 UTC,In my opinion the pilot is more or less as good as the show gets; season 2 makes a huge drop from season 1 which is relatively consistent starting with the pilot.
twinpeaks,3apjp6,Cooper_In_The_Lodge,5,Tue Jun 23 02:31:58 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people find something that doesn't appeal to them (be it TV show, movie, book whatever) , and their first instinct is to go into the appropriate subreddit in order to say how little they liked it. I just find it odd."
twinpeaks,3apjp6,DisKo_Lemonade90,3,Mon Jun 22 19:48:38 2015 UTC,"It's not odd, it's just a bunch of ADHD kids who need to be hooked in like three minutes or less."
twinpeaks,3apjp6,Thelonious_Cube,2,Tue Jun 23 00:18:21 2015 UTC,"Among other things TP is a parody of soap operas, so 'plot' is handled very differently than what you're probably used to - there are always new sub-plots being spawned and things get (laughably) complicated.  TP starts slow and was, I think, largely aimed at people who already had some sense of Lynch's sense of the absurd and his idiosyncratic mixture of humor and horror (or at people who were clueless re:Lynch and would be drawn in by a seemingly mainstream show).  Blue Velvet had made quite a splash.  Give it a few episodes and don't worry too much about the plot at first - enjoy the quirky, absurd characters and surreal touched (""...but first, a lecture about Tibet"") - you'll get hooked"
twinpeaks,3apjp6,TheCurseOfJamesDolan,2,Mon Jun 22 19:29:48 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Twin Peaks is very hot and cold. It goes from incredible television in season one to pretty bad television by middle season two. Then it's pretty good just before the end.  I think the exposition for most shows (and media in general) is the hardest part to get through. You have to meet the characters, understand what's going on and the actors are still growing into their roles.  I had a hard time getting into the series. I watched the pilot in freshman year of college and hated it. But I gave it another chance a few years later and loved the series. Then I started watching everything David Lynch.  Keep going. The sweet spot of the show is the mystery of Laura Palmer's death, Agent Cooper and Harry's (the Sheriff) bromance and Bob. Appreciate the creepiness of Bob."
twinpeaks,3apjp6,Melkor_Morgoth,2,Mon Jun 22 17:07:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone can answer your questions. The stuff is too subjective. I'd like to say ""stick with it"" because I love most of it. But the first episode is one of my favorites, so if you can't get into it, then I don't know if the following eps will be any better for you."

twinpeaks,3apjp6,bunipower,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:27:58 2015 UTC,I found it hard to watch the pilot all the way through in one go. I think this is because there are a lot of characters introduced for one pilot episode. It really picked up for me by the 3rd episode.

They were saying how they wanted to see inside out because agent cooper was in it?? I was shocked that they knew twin peaks and they were in love with it. I think it was since they saw it on Netflix, which is new and quite limited in Australia.

twinpeaks,3aiifi,some-freak,2,Sat Jun 20 14:49:19 2015 UTC,"Having listened on a weekly basis since the beginning (hearing the opening and then pausing as I watched the episode, and then resuming afterwards) that delay pissed me off so much, while at the same time I tried to remind myself that it was a free podcast (without sponsors!) so it's not exactly like I wasn't getting my money's worth.  But at the same time I integrated that into my weekly schedule every Tuesday, it was really nice to be watching something on a weekly pace rather than the binge watching that's typically the standard nowadays.

I'd take Fargo, Game of Thrones, Mad Men, Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, True Detective, and quite a few more series over the season-2 slump of Twin Peaks.   It is not good television.   The finale makes up for it, and a first time viewers should watch through all the episodes. But, I think we should be honest; the show gets terrible for a long stretch."
twinpeaks,3abia5,LittleRudiger,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:15:34 2015 UTC,"I see your point. The shows listed are relatively new shows so the comparison is a little apples and oranges.

Then flashbacks start to tell the grim story, of how he was possessed by BOB and committed horrible crimes.  Maybe he killed Annie.    Dale remembers his day in court, and how he told the blunt truth. The jury didn't buy the ""I was possessed by an evil otherworldly spirit"" defense.  (In short, it has to be done with layered flashbacks, one after another.  This is pure speculation but I think a good guess.)"
twinpeaks,3a79yr,shortbitcoin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 07:03:31 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but it could be done well.  And of course, most revelations will come out in the dialogue, but I can't see it being done coherently without any flashbacks at all.  I actually hope I'm proven wrong.  Anyhow, I have high hopes. A good director knows what the viewer truly wants, more than the viewer does."

What actually happened is that there were too many ""small-town"" shows on the air at the time Twin Peaks came out and those shows were floundering.  The executives at ABC thought America was sick of small towns.  So they specifically asked Mark Frost to add make the population 50,000 instead of 5,000.  They made the adjustment on the sign for ABC but 5,000 is the canon in the minds of David Lynch and Mark Frost."

twinpeaks,3a3snl,ttboo,5,Thu Jul 16 16:49:22 2015 UTC,"I grew up in a West Virginia town with fewer than 1,500 people, moved to another one of around 6,000 in 6th grade, and now live in a nearby city of about 50,000.   IMO, Twin Peaks comes off as a city/town of around 5k. Big enough to support some decent local eateries, watering holes, banks, a relatively active police force, and a tourist-friendly hospitality/convention center such as a large hotel.   The city I live in now is about 16.22 square miles, not including the river, and is very densely populated.   Unless Twin Peaks is about ten times the geographical size of that and fairly evenly populated with several heavily populated neighborhoods thrown in, then I'm pretty convinced that Frost and Lynch never intended to convey Twin Peaks as anything other than a small town of around 5,000, despite the welcome sign.  TLDR: Yeah, Twin Peaks feels a lot smaller than 50k."
twinpeaks,3a3snl,Andrew4Mayor,3,Wed Jun 17 09:24:35 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, we see only a fraction of the town's inhabitants, who all know and interact with each other. This gives it the feeling of being a much smaller town. In a real community of that size, random interactions would open things up to seeing a great many more people; but the quirky flavor of Twin Peaks never went in for casting a lot of extras for added ""realism""."
twinpeaks,3a3snl,CylonSpring,2,Wed Jun 17 16:13:08 2015 UTC,"I think you make a fair point, either way (51,201 or 5,120), we only see a small fraction of the town inhabitants in the show. But, the town doesn't seem to have the infrastructure of a town with a 50,000 population. There seems to be only one high school, the sheriff's department is small, one diner, one bar, a single major place of employment (the sawmill).  A population of 50,000 would demand an infrastructure of at least a small city.  In a small town, you can survive with a five person police department. Not so much in a city of 50,000 people."

twinpeaks,3a3wzj,westcoastmaximalist,2,Wed Jun 17 23:54:32 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'd hate to see your opinions on filmmakers you don't know about.   I asked you to enlighten me and you insulted me. Why?   if you came out of inland empire thinking that was lynch's attempt at a coherent, conventional movie   When did I say that was my takeaway?   I asked you for your take on why terrible choices in cinematography were part of what Lynch was aiming for and you responded with an appeal to the film's coherence (or lack thereof), suggesting you don't have a leg to stand on.   Even Lynch's weakest films (Wild at Heart, Dune) look amazing, and one is compelled to rewatch them even if they seem like nonsense, or even if the storytelling is less than stellar. In rewatching them, even if only for the aesthetics, one almost always found more there than at first met the eye. His films were dense, and unpacking them took several viewings.   But Inland Empire and everything since then has looked like garbage, and I have been in no way compelled to revisit anything he's done in that time to suss out hidden depths of meaning or storytelling.   I have rewatched Inland Empire once since seeing it in the theater. About a third of the way into it I found myself actually liking it quite a bit. By the end of hour 3, I once again thought it was awful. Were it not for the names of the talent involved, the film would be dismissed as just another garbage experimental indie movie shot on video by someone with so little skill that he left the autofocus on.   Perhaps the vision in his head remains as unsullied as it ever was, and ideally one would think that his having complete freedom of execution and exhibition would mean we were seeing those visions with even greater clarity. But the complete opposite is true. If anything, his taking on all the jobs himself exposes his lack of skill in those departments, and as a result only serves to diminish the success with which the vision in his head is perceived by the audience. He needs great collaborators like Caleb Deschanel to bring what's in his head out with true success. Without them, his movies are little more than home videos only called ""films"" because they are shot by the man who directed Blue Velvet.  Pre-Inland Empire David Lynch was one of my absolute favorite artists and filmmakers. I have studied his work, analyzed it, emulated it, been to exhibits of his art, read at least half a dozen books about and by him, written essays about him. But post-Inland Empire Lynch is a disappointment to me.  The Cowboy and The Frenchman is one of my favorite of his shorts, but let's take a piece like Idem Paris. This ""short film"" reminds me of when I would just shoot with my hi-8 camcorder, not edit it, but I would dub it to VHS and call it a movie. There aren't even audio dissolves on the cuts. This is lazy, sloppy ""filmmaking"" and we should hold David Lynch to a higher standard.  The original word going around that his interest in shooting on film had been reinvigorated by revisiting the Missing Pieces for Fire Walk With Me had me super excited. Hearing that he'll be shooting on digital after all is a bit of a bummer, although I have no doubt he'll be collaborating with a DP and shooting on an Epic or Alexa or better. I had been stoked - and still am! - for the possibility of a return to form. There are few things I feel as wild anticipation for as the revival of Twin Peaks. The new Star Wars movie is the only thing that comes close."

About half way through Season 2 just start fast-forwarding through James storylines and you'll be fine."
twinpeaks,3a6ier,swingsetlife,10,Wed Jun 17 17:26:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, here goes.  The Pilot is a work of art, though I don't recall initially falling in love with it. In fact, the whole show is a confusing jumble of various genre tropes and mixed emotions; the magic doesn't start to take hold until a few episodes into the first season when the seemingly scattershot construction can be seen for the deft balancing act the show is actually achieving.  Season 1, by and large, is good. It's not pushing itself into greatness, but it sets the stage and grows itself nicely.   Season 2 is where the first season comes to fruition. For the most part it is better on all levels. Gone is even the hint that the show is random or oblique in any way, the series is finally revealed for the deeply unsettling and deeply felt journey that it truly is. Well, until it ""peaks"" with its seventh episode, Lonely Souls. Here, the series hits its high note, one of the most profoundly affecting swatches of time in any visual medium.   In the second season's eighth episode, the turn for the worst begins. It's still the show you know and love, but something is different. Gone is the depth, the profundity, the connection you've been building over the course of it all. Everything seems, well, scattershot again, confusing bits of faux comedy crop up that lead nowhere, you're suddenly questioning whether the show had a point to it in the first place. The creative team waste no time shuffling plot lines and shoving necessary characters onto the back burner (or off the screen entirely). Bad decisions abound, the show becomes literal in a way it was never meant to. Within a few episodes it's an absolute bore, you're wondering how something could go south so quickly.   The rest of the season goes no better, in fact, it continues to miss the mark. The unfortunate part is, the mark was created by the first 14 or so episodes of the series. If there's one offensive bit of Twin Peaks, it's that it creates the thing you crave and then deprives you of it, creates its own standard of quality and then royally screws any attempt to reach it for the rest of the season. Watching the show pantomime itself is disappointing at first and eventually embarrassing.   Then the finale of season 2 arrives. Suddenly, the show you knew and loved returns for one incredible moment. You're not sorry for waiting while the show fumbled and stumbled, botching literally everything it had taken so long to get so right. The finale of the second season is worth all of the God awful nonsense that makes up episodes 9 - 21.  The show is an amazing thing. Lynch and Frost are able to transcend a television show to give a gift to anyone willing to listen. It's worth the watch and you won't be sorry."

Season 2 is where the first season comes to fruition.   Exactly. When I first watched it, I liked season one, but I wasn't a fanatic. When season two started to unfold and things got more and more ""supernatural"" I was totally hooked.  Now in retrospect I appreciate the genius of the first season all the more, because it was necessary to set up such an intricate and otherworldly plot."

twinpeaks,3a52o9,HooptyDooDooMeister,2,Fri Jun 19 03:38:13 2015 UTC,"Well, I am assuming that BOB is a about and we need a recognizable former host. Ray Wise doesn't seem to be busy, so..."
twinpeaks,3a52o9,Voduar,4,Fri Jun 19 05:08:18 2015 UTC,"My only real worries are having another round of boring storylines that don't contribute to the main plot, something like what we saw with James and Evelyn. Also, I want Cooper and Audrey to get together so if they keep the older characters in action I wouldn't mind. Even though Audrey might be dead. They are what made the original show, anyway.  As for youth in the show, there aren't many established young characters now, save Andy and Lucy's kid, who would be twenty five anyway. I swear, if they made Audrey pregnant with that gross guy (Billy Zane) I would be furious. And there's always the possibility of Annie and Coop having a kid, which would also make me furious, but I think their best bet is introducing new characters as teenagers, and they don't even have to be related to someone, they could be brought into Twin Peaks on business or something.  For a plot, if it was still 1991 I would want Andy and Lucy's kid to be murdered by evil Dale, then evil Dale would return to the Black Lodge and release good Dale, and all evidence would point to him in the murder. Although I'm not sure it was doppelganger Dale or just normal Dale possessed by BOB who was asking ""How's Annie?"" But it's not 1991 and unless they pretaped a bunch of flashbacks or something I don't think they could pull it off.  Anyway, I just really hope they don't fall into the same boring storylines, and I just want David Duchovny to reprise Dennis/Denise."

twinpeaks,3a52o9,TheWeakestLink,3,Wed Jun 17 19:33:43 2015 UTC,"As much as I love the coziness, and quirky humor, I hope there is still quasi self aware vibe, with regards to the show ""being about television itself"".  Also I hope it is surreal in a somewhat subtle way like in season 1, not just black lodge craziness.  Since fans have had 25 years to pick the show apart, a lot of focus has fallen on the lore.  I hope season 3 isn't written to appeal to just those who are into lore."
twinpeaks,3a52o9,HooptyDooDooMeister,3,Fri Jun 19 02:24:27 2015 UTC,My biggest worry is handling Bob wrong. My hope is that Lynch will do him right.
twinpeaks,3a52o9,shortbitcoin,3,Thu Jun 18 01:58:42 2015 UTC,"I worry about the possibility that Frost and Lynch won't want to introduce new characters.    I don't worry about that at all. They know what they're doing. This isn't a ""Twin Peaks Reunion"", this is season 3."

It was so fucking weird I cannot watch him now without thinking about that."

twinpeaks,3a3qql,milhaus,8,Thu Jun 18 02:59:32 2015 UTC,"I totally love Nadine, and her superhuman strength, and I loved the entire ridiculous going-back-to-highschool love-square subplot. In retrospect, I should have seen the way it would unfold coming a mile away, but it really caught me off guard."
twinpeaks,3a3qql,shortbitcoin,3,Wed Jun 17 03:44:14 2015 UTC,I get excited for every Nadine scene. She is my favorite part of the season 2 mid season slump.

twinpeaks,3a3qql,ExplosionsintheEye,5,Wed Jun 24 01:22:37 2015 UTC,"I've always loved Windom Earle, and his storyline. I think the fatal flaw in Season 2 was that it should've been a 13 episode season instead of 22, with Windom Earle coming into play before Laura's killer is revealed."
twinpeaks,3a3qql,swingsetlife,8,Thu Jun 18 22:47:38 2015 UTC,totally james.  edit: read that wrong. I hate james.
twinpeaks,3a3qql,sonichao,2,Wed Jun 17 01:32:42 2015 UTC,"I agree. James is easy to hate on/make fun of and is whiny for sure but like, he isn't that bad... The constant hating gets old"
twinpeaks,3a3qql,girlafraidx,3,Wed Jun 17 01:36:03 2015 UTC,"I didn't mind James that much truly. At least until the Evelyn subplot, the most annoying thing about James was the atrocious acting. Also, I liked the scene where James played the song.  I also liked Windom Earle and all of season two."

twinpeaks,3a3qql,davis98,2,Wed Jun 17 03:57:41 2015 UTC,Mike (as in Bobby Brigg's friend).  I find Nadine annoying at times but the late season 2 development between those two characters is great.  In fact I like all four characters tied into that story. Very angry when Nadine returned to her old self.

Twin Peaks should also be italicized wherever it appears. Same goes for any TV show, movie, or book title.   You make a good point about Twin Peaks lacking a good skeptic to counter the weirdness, which is where X-Files did much better with the character of Dana Scully. Sherriff Truman wasn't really what you could call a classic skeptical foil to Agent Cooper's true believer.  Good work. Keep at it. I would like to read more of your insights."

I have no idea why the notch is there, but just like any other symbol (crosses, check marks, etc.) there are probably more than a few variants."
twinpeaks,39o841,ThinkingViolet,32,Sat Jun 13 04:35:34 2015 UTC,"Well you don't rape and kill Laura Palmer between slapstick routines... I'm grateful that it is less ""controlled"" than the series.   The angel bit does throw me though, as it really wasn't part of the series mythology aside from Catherine's story about getting to Pearl Lakes which I always took with a grain of salt. The angel felt oddly ""tacked on"" at the last minute. But as a wise man once wrote: ""In heaven, everything is fine."""
twinpeaks,39o841,heresmything,13,Sat Jun 13 06:27:27 2015 UTC,"You are right, naturally. The lighthearted bits wouldn't have fit into this movie. I just didn't know the movie was going to be so relentless.   I don't buy Catherine's story about Pearl Lakes either. She lies as often and naturally as Ben Horn. But I thought the angel pieces might be a way to reference the White Lodge since they never got to do that in the show. I was surprised that Lynch went for such a traditional portrayal of an angel though, since his portrayals of the demonic are not exactly what you would call traditional."
twinpeaks,39o841,WildlifeAnalysis,6,Sat Jun 13 17:48:15 2015 UTC,I like the angel because she's so goddamn creepy. And I think throwing in something that exists outside of the series mythology makes the ending really mysterious and powerful.
twinpeaks,39o841,burntfishnchips,2,Sat Jun 13 16:34:44 2015 UTC,"The angel definitely creeped me out and I actually thought she fit in well because it was unexpected, yet can be expected from such a horrific situation.

twinpeaks,39o841,InerasableStain,6,Sun Jun 14 01:36:12 2015 UTC,"It actually was tacked on. It's not written into the screenplay at all. It was a concession made at the last minute by Lynch to Sheryl Lee, who specifically requested it to give the show some ""hope"""

twinpeaks,39o841,windsostrange,10,Sun Jun 14 03:03:15 2015 UTC,"Obligatory comment about how FWWM tackles issues like familial sexual abuse in such an oddly human way—and in a way few others have the courage or talent to even touch without it being terrible or weird or whatever—that many women to this day still thank Lynch for creating it so they can explore some of their own experiences through it.   It's still a barely-examined subject in mainstream art. And I don't know many others who can tackle it with the artfulness that David Lynch does. Life is full of complicated emotions, and FWWM is full of complicated emotions."
twinpeaks,39o841,burntfishnchips,6,Sat Jun 13 20:09:17 2015 UTC,"I also thought Lynch did a great job handling Laura's mental instability after being sexually abused for years. As a survivor myself, i truly thank him for not mocking it in a way most series do for 'shock value.'  He truly gave life for Laura Palmer's character and fleshed her out much more in the movie versus the series, where we only knew her through bits and pieces of hear say and flash backs. I applaud him for that."
twinpeaks,39o841,Confused_Shelf,3,Sun Jun 14 01:27:10 2015 UTC,"That is a good point too. I had a long conversation about the film today (it's thought-provoking, whatever other flaws it may have), and if you think of it without the context of the show, it's almost like the extreme trauma suffered by Laura (and her drug problem) caused her to create a mythology to cope with the horrible things in her life. For example, while I think it is clear from the show and the movie that BOB killed Teresa Banks, it is ambiguous to me whether it was Leland who decided to pursue the company of a prostitute to begin with. It was also Leland who confronted Laura aggressively and jealously at the family dinner table about her ""lovers."""
twinpeaks,39o841,snazzmasterj,7,Sun Jun 14 04:03:39 2015 UTC,"First time I watched it a month or two ago it was a big disappointment.  Now I'm almost finished my David Lynch marathon (8 down, only Mul. Dr. and Inland Empire to go) and I appreciated it a lot more second time through.  I still think it flies off the rails at the end what with the angels and it isn't as well made as a lot of his other work but it is much more in the style of his movies than the style of Twin Peaks the TV show."

twinpeaks,39o841,shortbitcoin,2,Sat Jun 13 22:29:21 2015 UTC,"It's not my favorite (largely due to its length and the muddy quality the inexpensive video gives) but to appreciate Inland Empire, you have to think of it like music.

Starts out incredibly boring and then looks like it's going to become a horror (which I was not expecting). Suddenly it takes a shift and it is a lighthearted thriller (that tailgating scene) only for it to return to boring for the next hour before the finale. I was just repeating ""What is going on here?"" to myself over and over again as I watched those final 10-15 minutes. Having reflected on it I think it might even be worse than Dune (a film of contrasting halves if ever I saw one)."

twinpeaks,39o841,snazzmasterj,2,Sun Jun 14 00:46:12 2015 UTC,I like Inland Empire a lot more than Mulholland Drive. But I would say both (for different reasons) are the hardest Lynch films to sit through and digest.

With Inland Empire I still get intrigued, confused and really feel Sue/Nikki's fear and disorientation, even though I've watched it like 11-12 times by now.

These are directly from DL himself, so there's definitely nothing spoiled in reading them before watching: 1. Pay particular attention in the beginning of the film; at least two clues are revealed before the credits. 2. Notice appearances of the red lampshade. 3. Can you hear the title of the film that Adam Kesher is auditioning actresses for? Is it mentioned again? 4. An accident is a terrible event...notice the location of the accident. 5. Who gives a key, and why? 6. Notice the robe, the ashtray, the coffee cup. 7. What is felt, realized and gathered at the club Silencio? 8. Did talent alone help Camilla? 9. Note the occurrences surrounding the man behind Winkles. 10. Where is Aunt Ruth?  Enjoy! The movie is his magnum opus imo."

twinpeaks,39o841,nein_danke,6,Sat Jun 13 13:58:03 2015 UTC,"The movie is definitely more brutal and horrific than the show as much of it concerns actually showing the horrendous crimes of Leland Palmer, and Laura's sordid double life that were only mentioned and alluded to on the show.  I don't think the more lighthearted bits would have worked in the film and I think it was right to remove them. I do like having them as a supplement, though. I think they're important and they do add to Twin Peaks as a whole. I view them as canon, even if they don't fit into the telling of Laura's last days."

Looking back after having seen the movie though, I really liked the super-creepy editing style with no music, the long drawn out scenes and the black screens between sections.

So it follows that the name BOB has certain useful symmetries which better enable BOB to, as Mike might say, ""chant out between the two worlds.""  The world of the Lodges is a kind of mirror world to that of Twin Peaks (specifically, Ghostwood). Remember, to enter the Lodge in the finale, ""Beyond Life and Death"", Cooper, Earle, and Annie Blackburn must past around a black, circular, mirror-like pool, which serves as the gateway to the Lodge (the Log Lady says, ""This oil in an opening to a gateway,"" in same episode). This mirror-quality is part of the reason for the backward-forward manner of speaking used there. So forward or backward, whether in the Lodges or Twin Peaks, it's still BOB, and not merely boB."

The film was edited and produced by Mary Sweeney, Lynch's longtime partner and co-worker. She co-wrote the script with John E. Roach. The film is based on the true story of Alvin Straight's 1994 journey across Iowa and Wisconsin on a lawn mower. Alvin (Richard Farnsworth) is an elderly World War II veteran who lives with his daughter Rose (Sissy Spacek), a kind woman with a mental disability. When he hears that his estranged brother Lyle (Harry Dean Stanton) has suffered a stroke, Alvin makes up his mind to go visit him and hopefully make amends before he dies. Because Alvin's legs and eyes are too impaired for him to receive a driving license, he hitches a trailer to his recently purchased thirty-year-old John Deere 110 Lawn Tractor, having a maximum speed of about 5 miles per hour,  and sets off on the 240 mile journey from Laurens, Iowa to Mount Zion, Wisconsin.

twinpeaks,38ndit,acidcock,3,Wed Jun 10 01:31:37 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go a different direction than everyone and say Albert when he was first introduced. Not for the reasons people dislike characters like James(often poorly written, irrelevant to the plot, etc) but because his character was genuinely unlikable, and that was the point of his character. He was the opposite of Cooper. Cold, uncaring, and an overall ass.  That said, I love his turnaround when he tells off Truman and explains why he would never hit the sheriff. In one scene he goes from unlikable to turning all of his flaws into exactly why he's so likable"
twinpeaks,38ndit,sprkwd,3,Wed Jun 10 10:55:47 2015 UTC,"I will say I genuinely disliked Albert as first too. As soon as he stepped into the Sheriff's office and spoke badly to Lucy and then to Harry, I was like ""Fuck this guy."" But then when he really turned around and became the zen guy who doesn't believe in physical violence, I really liked him. I thought he was a great character and played his part well because everyone really hated him and cheered when Harry punched him. Haha."

None of the Twin Peaks actors were very famous before Twin Peaks, (Yes, I know that Kyle was in Dune and Blue Velvet, they were not box office smashes).  I think any new faces will definately be just that, new. I think celebrity would distract you from the story, I don't think Lynch want to watch a scene and go ""Oh shit, look it's the guy from Pulp Fiction"". If a known actor is on screen he'll be so good you won't recognize him or her.  That's my two cents."
twinpeaks,38euy2,kansascityborn,3,Wed Jun 3 20:56:06 2015 UTC,"I understand that completely. I don't want Lynch to lose an aspect his artistry just to pander to having a star studded cast.

You have the episodes where the actual mystery of Laura Palmer's death is solved in front of you, and they are great. Those, however, are followed up by episodes that fumbles for storylines and comes up pretty short when they choose to focus on James Hurley, introduce some slick rich guy played by Billy Zane, introduce an old nemesis for Dale who is basically the Riddler from batman, and generally neglect the weirdness for which Twin Peaks is beloved for run-of-the-mill soap opera writing.  I'm currently on my first run-through, and these things being said, I've somehow fallen too much in love with the setting and the actually interesting characters, chief among them Dale, that I haven't considered quitting. I'm currently 5 episodes from the end of season two, and as I hear it, the last few are supposed to get back to the rich creamy center of the series.  I hear there's a fan-edit of the series floating around, called Northwest Passage (the originally proposed name of the series) that edits out everything irrelevant to the central plot and condenses the 30 episodes into a five hour long feature film. I haven't seen it, but i hear it's pretty good, so that could be a viable option if you're impatient and still wish to see it all wrapped up."

twinpeaks,38cqyb,letbaconcry,5,Wed Jun 3 17:45:35 2015 UTC,In places where one normally illicitly acquires copyright-protected material and things of that nature. There's no legitimate way to distribute an inofficial re-cut of someone elses work.
twinpeaks,38cqyb,ThrillerBOB,-9,Wed Jun 3 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"It's not even impatience at this point, the acting of James, Maddy, Harold, Julie and the Japanese characters is genuinely difficult to watch.

twinpeaks,38cqyb,Beardycitrus,7,Wed Jun 3 19:29:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with you in a way. Series 2 has a lot of low points, most of which don't have anything to do with the main plot. From what I've heard, this is because the network demanded a really long season. Lynch reluctantly agreed because otherwise he couldn't continue the project.   Now here's the kicker, Lynch didn't direct most of the episodes in the second series, only the plot important ones. This was because, at the time, he was working on another project (can't remember what) that meant more to him than those 20-something filler episodes of Twin Peaks.   You want to know why you should keep watching? Well, I'd say do it just to stick with Cooper's story and all the weird mysticism that comes with it. I don't care much for all the side stories, but the main plot has me rewatching the entire show every so often.  EDIT: If you don't like some of the acting, wait till you see a fresh faced Heather Graham make her appearance. How she got hired for anything after this still boggles the mind."

Sit back down and trust mo-foing DAVID LYNCH to rock all the episodes he had left to the best degree anyone in the universe could under those circumstances. If you have certain expectations for the ending of this show you will be dissapointed and miss the myriad of scattered magic left to go."
twinpeaks,38cqyb,kansascityborn,11,Wed Jun 3 16:29:26 2015 UTC,"If we have to do that then it isn't for you.   Twin Peaks isn't about the destination, it's about the journey.  That said, most of Season 2 is pales in comparison to season 1. The show lost direction, Lynch lost interest due t pressure from ABC to reveal Laura's killer.  There's some good bits in season 2, but overall it isn't great and in retrospect really only serves to get us more involved with a town most of us love, and we love it for that.   Most of us hardcore fans want to be in Twin Peaks, we love that world. So anything, a bad second season, a book, a news article, anything that gets us closer to Twin Peaks is a good thing."

twinpeaks,38cqyb,blackbirdsongs,4,Wed Jun 3 12:42:35 2015 UTC,"Seconded. I think we all wade through some shit episodes of any show, it's the overarching achievement of the series that matters. If you can't appreciate it then you don't deserve it."

twinpeaks,38cqyb,heresmything,-1,Fri Jun 5 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"I stand by what I wrote. It IS a privilege to view the greatest show in the history of the medium. Just as it’s a privilege to view the Mona Lisa or the Sistine Chapel in person. Nothing elitist about saying that. We are lucky that, for once, Art slipped through the giant commerce machine of TV in the early 90s.   It would be silly to post “Give me a reason to like Picasso, his brush strokes are so sloppy and there are too many bulls” to a Picasso fan group, so why do the equivalent here?"
twinpeaks,38cqyb,JaxTeller718,0,Fri Jun 5 23:29:01 2015 UTC,"Anyone can order this show on any blu ray website, making your comparison a bit silly.  I am not disagreeing that the show is indeed a work of art. Along with the movie it is a compelling and mesmerizing piece of horror drama and comedy. But it DOES have it's flaws and I can understand how certain aspects can be polarizing. The story has many different arcs, not everyone has to love every single one of them to appreciate the genius of the main arc, Coopers arc or the Lodges arc."
twinpeaks,38cqyb,polaroidgeek,3,Sat Jun 6 03:26:32 2015 UTC,I love Twin Peaks and I likewise don't care for the James storyline in season 2.  And the Harold thing is also a bit silly.  HOWEVER.... Stick with it.  It pays off.  Right about now in the show is when Lynch was off doing film work and a few other directors took turns at the helm of the show & the show suffered for it.  It does get better and gets back on track as the series concludes.
twinpeaks,38cqyb,Smugsy2099,3,Wed Jun 3 15:50:49 2015 UTC,"I think just about everyone struggles with at least some aspects of season two. Some things that might help: 1. Some of your complaints may actually be done that way on purpose, in ways that won't be clear until later. 2. Remind yourself that this is a pastiche on a soap opera. That gives it (in my mind at least) some leeway with weird acting choices and cheesy nonsense. It doesnt forgive all, but Maddy for example looks a lot better through this lens. It's about taking that style and warping it. 3. The last two or three episodes of season two are pretty fucking interesting, if you're into the mythology. You'll have some duds on the way, but some of the stuff that comes to light (whether by Lynch's hand or not) are worth watching. 4. You said yourself that in terms of TV history, this is indispensable. If you still believe that, then don't toss it aside.    Good luck, friend!"

twinpeaks,38cqyb,JaxTeller718,5,Wed Jun 3 11:50:42 2015 UTC,"Sure. It's not as good as season one. Successful shows rarely top their initial season(s). The very end of the series however is probably the best TV ever, but you can't really skip to it without slogging through some of the lesser episodes. Bear this in mind though: Twin Peaks features a lot of over acting and cheesiness like that of many soap operas (which is basically what the show is). This is intentional."
twinpeaks,38cqyb,Peevee89,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:58:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this query pops up more than any other on this subreddit. In many fans' opinion, the second series does go downhill (but for most this isn't for another few episodes yet from where you've got). For me, when I was watching it, I was almost entirely interested in the main storyline and the supporting stories were all just mildly entertaining at most. I would definitely recommend you continue watching at least to ""Arbitrary Law"" - episode 11 or so I think. Get some closure. The Laura Palmer story is the essence of the show of course, and one of the most haunting of TV history. Whether you continue from there is up to you.   I'd recommend you watch Fire Walk with Me though."
twinpeaks,38cqyb,JaxTeller718,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:12:25 2015 UTC,"Dont watch it, simple as that... If you dont enjoy the story around Harold and all the mystery surrounding it, than stop watching, srsly..."

Thats why Iam saying he shouldnt keep watching, he is obviously not into this kind of stuff."
twinpeaks,38cqyb,Beardycitrus,1 point,Fri Jun 5 17:47:13 2015 UTC,"But in the overall arc, the one that WE love and appreciate, he is not important. We have the luxury of having seen the final few episodes, we know what is to come and we know NOW to appreciate the whole vision. I remember when watching on network TV myself saying that the Harold stuff was just a way to keep the Laura murder going without having to actually solve it. It is not until the bookcase scene and the end of that episode that I remember going ""Oh SHIT now it is going to get good!"" And it did, it got GREAT. But we have that luxury of knowing where this is going. This person needs to give it to at least the final episode of the Laura arc. If that ending in the woods does not compel them to stick with it then nothing will. THAT to me is where they should walk away because it introduces the horror element that becomes important at the end of the series."

twinpeaks,3852mg,iulius_caesar,14,Mon Jun 1 22:28:48 2015 UTC,"Hard to say for certain. But once you know who the killer is, many scenes play entirely differently upon rewatch.  In short, the identity of the killer is not a cheat, which I suspect is the real question behind your question. It makes perfect sense who killed Laura.  In hindsight all the clues you've learned along the way fit. But whether or not you can solve it before it's revealed on the show may come down to your perception of a certain character's behavior.   EDIT: Please try to solve it as you watch and let us know how it goes. I would be very curious to know how close you get."

Anyway, it's a pretty well-circulated rumour (generally considered to have some truth to it) that Laura Flynn Boyle got really jealous over the attention Sherilyn Fenn was getting, and found it uncomfortable that Sherilyn's character was playing the romantic interest to Kyle (LFB + Kyle Machlachlan were dating at the time). So, the Audrey romance was vetoed and they hastily wrote in Annie + John Justice Wheeler. They weren't written in because Cooper/Audrey didn't have chemistry . . hell, it's actually the opposite. They started writing in scenes specifically because the director's saw chemistry between the two."

The general consensus I've seen here, and on other forums (Dugpa), is that one of the major failures of season 2 was switching the romance story away from Cooper-Audrey.   Hell, look at Sherilyn Fenn's twitter to see her lamenting at the story being changed.   I really think you're in the absolute minority on this one, which is fine, but, don't pretend that your opinion is reflective of the majority, nor that it's well documented, when there is information floating around to the contrary.  Laura Flynn Boyle pressured Kyle Machlachlan into vetoing the story, as they were dating at the time.

I think Lynch wanted to do that (years ahead of his time) but never got the chance.  It would be perfect.  Cooper falls in love, but Bob continues his rampage, and Annie was going to be the shocking ""OMG, how could she die?"" plot twist. Suddenly this isn't a typical FBI investigation, things have gotten personal. That obnoxious FBI agent suggests that Cooper be taken off the case due to personal conflict, but Gordon Cole stands by Dale.    Please note: I'm not making predictions for the upcoming season 3, I'm making predictions of what season 3 would have looked like if it aired in 1993 like it was supposed to have. After 25 years, all bets are off."

twinpeaks,37ys7l,burntfishnchips,10,Fri Jun 5 09:43:58 2015 UTC,"I never wanna see John Justice Wheeler again, nor do I want Window Earle back either, least intimidating villain of all time, just a stupid cartoon character.   For minor characters, I'd love to have Jerry Horne, Albert, Dr. Jacoby and Gordon Cole back, I love all of these. It would be especially fantastic seeing Lynch reprise Gordon Cole again, I just love him in that role so much. Same goes for the TMFAP, but I think Michael J. Anderson brought up a great point once on facebook about his role on the show and how he was shocking and a surprise back then, it was an unsettling thing to see him. At this point the character is so iconic and revered that having him back on the show would be predictable, basically the antithesis of what that character stood for in the original run of the show and the movie. I think that's a good point but if they can execute on it right, I'd love to see him at least once again."
twinpeaks,37ys7l,givemethatsprinklers,7,Sun May 31 15:42:44 2015 UTC,I think TMFAP should come back because he's important to the story of Twin Peaks now.
twinpeaks,37ys7l,letbaconcry,3,Sun May 31 17:09:05 2015 UTC,"I think Windom Earle had great potential, being the dark counterpart to Cooper, but they definitely squandered him..."
twinpeaks,37ys7l,douko,1 point,Sun May 31 20:35:03 2015 UTC,"You've said it all. Most characters who were minor at the outset seemed major as the second season tossed in a slew of forgettables. Windom Earle is the perfect example of what was wrong with the later Peaks episodes and doesn't need to be in the conclusion. The benefit of the 25 years is that the less compelling characters can simply have gone elsewhere in the off-time.  Miguel Ferrer, David Patrick Kelly (which doesn't even mean Jerry Horne needs to return, TP is not the show that needs to be hung up on continuity, I'd love for Jerry to have a return, though wouldn't mind seeing some old faces crop up as new characters), Everett McGill, Russ Tamblyn and Warren Frost will all hopefully be back. Characters like Hank or Leo had good roles to play in season 1, but were botched during the later 2 episodes when the show couldn't figure out what to do with them. Leo's return would be ridiculous after the show turned him into Earle's sidekick.   When I think of Twin Peaks, I presume season 1, first half of 2, the finale and FWWM as canon, I watched season 2 in its entirety exactly once many years ago, and have no desire to revisit (though I've rewatched many times FWWM and episodes 1 - 16) , I assume the fan base feels the same."
twinpeaks,37ys7l,Cardow,3,Sun May 31 17:07:23 2015 UTC,Personally I like Windom Earle and Annie and the Lodge stuff it was great
twinpeaks,37ys7l,damngoodcoffeebob,2,Sun May 31 18:45:48 2015 UTC,"Earle in the lodge, under Lynch's direction, was great - If they keep him there I'm all for it, but he's not a character I need to see come back in season 3. When it comes to the entire season, it's not so much that characters need to return, in general (though it would be great to see the familiar faces), but the mysteries of Twin Peaks continued to grow post-Palmer reveal, and grew in a big way in Fire Walk with Me, it's these mysterious elements that need a proper conclusion, whereas most character arcs had been completed already by the mid-point of season 2."
twinpeaks,37ys7l,Cardow,2,Mon Jun 1 22:41:48 2015 UTC,"I would at least like to see their stories completed. Something like confirming Leo's death or mentioning Windom Earle is in jail. Saying Jerry left town. I need a Big Ed cameo though! Same with Catherine Martell, need a cameo. Lynch will do a good mix of not letting cameos interfere with the new story. I think there will be another murder in TP which will allow Miguel Ferrer to return. Warren Frost is 90 so I don't know about him."
twinpeaks,37ys7l,colinrgeorge,3,Mon Jun 1 00:06:47 2015 UTC,"I have no idea where most fans stand on this character, but I love Ian Buchanan as Dick Tremayne. I know he expressed interest in returning, and I'd to see what that smarmy bastard is up to today."

twinpeaks,37wxic,ConradBHart42,-2,Sun May 31 11:51:54 2015 UTC,"I still want to say that this symbol has less to do with the owls and is more a symbol for the Twin Peaks area.  the ^ symbols are shelters or lodges, with the one pointing up representing the white lodge and the one pointing down representing the black lodge.  And the two in the back are self-explanatory, I hope."
twinpeaks,37wxic,ConradBHart42,2,Sun May 31 05:34:27 2015 UTC,"Its definitely the owl symbol. It was in the cave. Google ""twin peaks owl"" and this shows up everywhere.

twinpeaks,37wxic,ThrillerBOB,0,Sun May 31 11:50:02 2015 UTC,"A bunch of fan-sites aren't confirmation.  Yes, it's called the owl cave, by humans that found it and interpreted in much the same way the TP community does.  I'm not saying that the symbol doesn't look like an owl - I'm saying it has this older and much grander meaning as well.  It also doesn't make a lot of sense to me that the lodges would use owls as their symbol, since the owls are supposed to be servants of the lodge(s).  That'd be like Hogwarts from the Harry Potter franchise using owls as their symbol, when they're just pets and mail couriers.    And you know what they say - The owls are not what they seem.  Why can't that extend to depictions of the owls."

twinpeaks,37q1nq,gloamingchild,69,Fri May 29 16:26:53 2015 UTC,"I think the thing about Twin Peaks that eludes a lot of people is that not only is a Lynchian mystery with supernatural weirdness, but it's also a soap opera satire/parody.  James embodies those dark drifter, love triangle, bad boy with a heart of gold stereotypes that were staples of soap operas.  There is a reason that he wasn't directly involved with any of the Black Lodge stuff... because he was in the show to serve another aspect of it entirely."

twinpeaks,37q1nq,dilettanteTunesmith,6,Fri May 29 16:50:38 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I didn't even find it the worst character arc in Season 2, personally; sure, it wasn't the best, but I just kinda chalked it up to him being just a dumbass kid. Granted, I'm not saying that being his age automatically means you're a dumbass, just that he specifically is young and dumb. And though it doesn't make it more enjoyable of a story, at least it somewhat rationalizes it, I guess? At least how his character acts. Evelyn was dumb IMO, though.  Frankly, my least fave I think is a toss up between the Ben Horne arc and the Nadine arc. Mostly because one is always going to render the other superfluous because of how similar they are at their core (character goes through trauma, goes nuts, family plays along with their delusions at the insistence of the doctor). But I personally liked how ridiculous Ben Horne got, so I'm partial to that.  All that aside, I have to admit, I kinda actually liked season two, cause a lot of it felt like a really cheesy soap opera parody, and I like really cheesy parodies."

twinpeaks,37w0ne,writingtoss,6,Sun May 31 04:21:10 2015 UTC,"US. The EU pilot spoils a pretty significant part of the story and was not even intended as a television episode, it was more an attempt to wrap things up, had the show not been successful, so it could be sold as a straight to video film.  So the regular pilot is what you're looking for."
twinpeaks,37w0ne,givemethatsprinklers,6,Sat May 30 21:46:29 2015 UTC,This question has been answered correctly twice already but I want to reiterate that you should definitely watch the US pilot and avoid the EU pilot. The EU pilot contains scenes that spoil major plot points of the show. Those scenes were added as a failsafe to make the pilot a self contained complete story in case the network never picked up the show. So watch the US pilot.

Better yet, complete the entire series first. Then you should absolutely go back and watch the EU/International version.  The International Version is a self-contained story and wraps up the murder plot with a few minutes of additional footage. It has some spoilers, and portions of the additional footage were used in the subsequent episode, Zen, or the Skill to Catch a Killer."

twinpeaks,37tks3,Confused_Shelf,9,Sat May 30 19:16:04 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of David Lynch's scenes walk the line between comedy and horror. I think the rape scene in Blue Velvet is deeply disturbing but also laugh out loud funny. Same thing with the Laura Palmer's funeral scene when Leland is riding the coffin up and down. It's disturbing, deeply sad but also really goofy. That weird, uncomfortable in-between space is David Lynch's signature."

It's like an out of control id running around.   As much as I love it and saw it 3 times in the theater, I have to admit that one shot doesn't work for me. It did elicit laughs in the theater."
twinpeaks,37tks3,heresmything,1 point,Sat May 30 19:40:06 2015 UTC,"That is true, and I don't know if that worries me or makes me excited for season 3. Is it going to be 18 episodes of Fire Walk With Me or will it find a middle ground between the insanity of the movie and the more streamlined nature of the TV show? Because as brilliant as David Lynch is, because of the nature of his film making style his projects can sometimes go way out of control and become a total mess (Lost Highway.) I'm hoping that Mark Frost will reign him in a little bit. I think the restrictions that were placed on Lynch by the network made the show what it is. But nowadays networks like Showtime and HBO let the creators do whatever they want. Which is great, but sometimes there are merits to those restrictions."

Frost split and took all narrative sense with him. There was no real plan in place beyond the finale. The ""look"" will be closer to FWWM than the series since it will be on location, but it should be the best of both worlds: Lynch with the visionary (literally) ideas and Frost plotting them out into a semi-coherent narrative."

We knew something was rotten behind the facade. FWWM stepped up the game and showed us what was behind it, but we weren't told the reason why things were like this in Twin Peaks. The third season sounded initially like a way to answer this and provide a satisfying end to the show. I don't see how just providing more of the same TV vibe will do anything other than giving us a nostalgia kick.  I understand that people wouldn't necessarily want a whole season of FWWM level darkness (though if that's what Lynch wanted to do, I don't think he'd shy away from doing it) but I get the feeling that FWWM and the new plot elements it introduced are likely to get sidelined.  I think that Lynch and Frost will make a quality third season, but i'd much rather have had a lower budget, no-compromise, Lynch/Engels written S3 that keeps it dark (now that the secrets are out, etc) and just puts the story to bed in a way that if it is even half as good as FWWM, it would be a triumph."

Shelly Johnson had a Walther PPK, which disappeared around the time of the fire. Josie Packard was elsewhere at the time, and Catherine Martell was at the mill with Shelly. The next time we see the Walther, aside from the shooting, is when Catherine is revealing it to be hidden in a bookcase to Josie before she goes to meet Eckhardt. The only other forensic evidence was that the shooter wore a woman's coat. Josie's reasons for shooting Cooper never made much sense to me, so did Catherine frame Josie for it?"

twinpeaks,37h242,ziggykareem,7,Wed May 27 17:23:36 2015 UTC,"I read something somewhere- maybe the ""spy"" report that claims a new central character is an investigative reporter- that Cooper's been in jail the whole time, that he killed two citizens while possessed. Who knows if it's true or not, but it's an interesting alternative to Cooper living a ""normal"" life. If he does live a ""normal"" life, I'd imagine he stays in Twin Peaks. It seems something he'd do, and my recollection is that in one of his Diane recordings he mentions wanting to look at his retirement account and think about settling there."
twinpeaks,37h242,Applesauce_McGee,4,Wed May 27 17:33:31 2015 UTC,"^ THIS. In the extended cut of the movie, the nurse takes the ring from Annie and puts it on (The man from another place said ""with this ring I thee wed"", and the movie insinuates the evil spirits victims wear the ring). I think BOB possessed Dale killed the nurse, and killed Annie and Twin Peaks is going to pick up with Dale coming out of jail."
twinpeaks,37h242,killer_corgi,3,Wed May 27 18:06:42 2015 UTC,"I love the theory that Coop has been jailed for 25 years. Most likely he kills the nurse who takes the ring, the second victim should be Major Briggs to explain his absence, this also gives Bobby a nice vendetta against Coop. Best hope is that Bobby has switched to a protagonist, good-natured character in the interim, but his dislike for Agent Cooper brings back undertones of the old mischievous Bobby, his connections to darker characters like Hank resurface after 25 years.   Audrey, of course, is alive and well - as a successful businesswoman, she is one of the few in town who believe there's hope to save Cooper. Sheriff Truman, Andy and Hawk are other allies of Cooper, whereas the rest of the town has willfully forgotten the strange events of 25 years prior and choose to believe that Cooper had been deceiving them the entire time he was in Twin Peaks. Truman locks Coop up in the station to keep an eye on him and as a measure of protecting him, assuring that state and federal law enforcement never get their hands on him until a solution can be found.  Ed split from Nadine soon after season 2 and went off with Norma. They found they weren't right for each other and Ed soon returned to Nadine, who took him back. James is sad. So sad.

I visited and ate there a few times last week and we overheard the owner (who is very friendly) saying that he had been on the phone with David Lynch recently. The next day it was announced that it was being renovated... I guess I know what that call was about now

Strigoi are vampires (remember what BOB possessed Leland did to collect the garmonbozia) associated with the strix which are evil owl spirits.

Nothing is official until announced by Showtime and confirmed by Lynch. I'm hoping this is 2 seasons of 9 episodes each, which would give lynch/frost much more time to manage the quality than 18 all at once."
twinpeaks,37b81g,boyonstilts,3,Tue May 26 14:47:31 2015 UTC,Exactly. We already have a season two. Let's not repeat that.
twinpeaks,37b81g,windsostrange,1 point,Tue May 26 14:52:17 2015 UTC,"With Lynch being more of an adaptive, spontaneous creator - I'm not sure the extra time would really result in 'better' quality. It would simply be different based on his train of thought leading up to the actual production.   Personally, I find Lynch to be the most compelling when he does something more reactionary than something planned. A lot of the great touches that appear in Lynch's Twin Peaks episodes were a product of random, spontaneous inspiration.  The only risk of splitting it up is that if the first 9 episodes proved to be a commercial flop - there's a good chance we'd never get to see the final 9."
twinpeaks,37b81g,HotBeefyMcD,2,Tue May 26 17:56:59 2015 UTC,"Although I am hype over the fact we will get 18 episodes of this show we all thought was dead and buried, I agree with the logic that 18 hours (possibly more if the premiere/finales run at an extended length?) of television is a lot for anyone to consecutively direct...especially for an 70 year old film auteur who has not directed a production in over ten years. I'd gladly eat my words on this if Lynch & co. could prove me wrong. I'd be fine with two separate seasons of nine episodes each. That actually makes a lot of sense."

twinpeaks,378ksr,minibuddhaa,1 point,Mon May 25 19:46:48 2015 UTC,"Section 2. Season one of article  Twin Peaks:       On the morning of February 24, in the town of Twin Peaks, Washington, logger Pete Martell (Jack Nance) discovers a naked corpse tightly wrapped in a sheet of clear plastic on the bank of a river. When Sheriff Harry S. Truman (Michael Ontkean), his deputies, and Dr. Will Hayward (Warren Frost) arrive on the scene, the body is identified as homecoming queen Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee). The news of her death spreads rapidly among the town's residents, particularly Laura's family and friends. A badly injured second girl, Ronette Pulaski, is found across the state line walking along the railroad tracks in a fugue state. Because Ronette was discovered across the state line, FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper is called in to investigate. Cooper's initial examination of Laura's body reveals a tiny typed letter ""R"" inserted under her fingernail. Cooper informs the community that Laura's death matches the signature of a killer who murdered another girl in southwestern Washington the previous year, and that evidence indicates the killer lives in Twin Peaks.

twinpeaks,371ekn,Ghopper21,19,Sat May 23 23:46:20 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that nine scripts were approved initially. I think the expansion was just something that was agreed to as a compromise so that Showtime also got more for their money, and from the producer/director's side, expanded their canvas. Eventually I hope the real story will emerge without anyone losing face."
twinpeaks,371ekn,PourJarsInReservoirs,13,Sun May 24 00:04:35 2015 UTC,"There's no possible way they just threw on an additional 9 episodes to make more money.  Lynch would NEVER agree to that.  Every second will be essential story, I can't see Lynch doing it any other way.  He has to have a plan for all 18 episodes."
twinpeaks,371ekn,Scapone22,8,Sun May 24 01:41:55 2015 UTC,"Inland empire. Great film. But not all filled with ""essential story"""
twinpeaks,371ekn,Prometheus357,12,Sun May 24 04:17:09 2015 UTC,pretty sure none of the story in that movie is essential. nor does it need to be.
twinpeaks,371ekn,westcoastmaximalist,3,Sun May 24 04:19:30 2015 UTC,You can hardly compare Inland Empire to Twin Peaks.
twinpeaks,371ekn,brumsmithy,4,Sun May 24 09:44:30 2015 UTC,No you can't. But it is a good measure of how you don't need essential story to put out quality
twinpeaks,371ekn,Prometheus357,4,Sun May 24 12:33:41 2015 UTC,Of course he would. See the original show.
twinpeaks,371ekn,sheepcat87,0,Sun May 24 17:04:07 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree. I just think the negotiations went slowly and well enough that, kind of like when Lord of the Rings went from a two film deal to a trilogy, commerce and art each benefited."
twinpeaks,371ekn,PourJarsInReservoirs,2,Sun May 24 03:12:51 2015 UTC,I wouldn't doubt that showtime was expecting 9 1/2 hr episodes then they got the hour long scripts and then showtime started to pump the breaks lynch and frost then opened the negotiations to have the longer episodes but the final deal became the 18 episodes. The 9 hour long episodes divided to give the 18 episodes rumored.
twinpeaks,371ekn,Prometheus357,-1,Sun May 24 04:16:21 2015 UTC,"It's showtime. I've never been a fan of their original content they had me for a few moments with californication but that quickly sank. Every time I get excited for a showtime deal I get discouraged at its quality.   Now, this being a big deal and all with loads of talent behind it makes me feel a lot more at ease with the output. I don't recall showtime ever having such heavy artillery behind the camera before.   (Side note: I had hoped that HBO or Netflix would have picked up the show durning those limbo moments, however cbs owns TW and showtime is a sibling company of cbs so I knew that would never have happened.)"
twinpeaks,371ekn,Prometheus357,3,Sun May 24 05:39:52 2015 UTC,"The show always had 60-90 minute episodes (with ads). There's no reason they would've expected half hour episodes. I would put my money on them doubling the order after seeing the public attention and interest the announcement generated, and after seeing the quality of the scripts."
twinpeaks,371ekn,Rubular,1 point,Sun May 24 12:32:28 2015 UTC,I don't think it was showtime that doubled the order. I think lynch realized that the story he wanted to tell couldn't be told in just nine episodes and that's why he was going to back out if they didn't extend the order.
twinpeaks,371ekn,frank_has_a_kid,40,Sun May 24 10:24:17 2015 UTC,"I'll believe it when there's an official announcement. I wouldn't be surprised if this is a misunderstanding, that maybe there was talk of ""doubling the length"" but they just meant the first and last episodes."
twinpeaks,371ekn,mattkward,18,Sun May 24 18:13:19 2015 UTC,I would hope that they read the contracts they sign.
twinpeaks,371ekn,westcoastmaximalist,4,Sun May 24 00:20:41 2015 UTC,This is my thought as well. as much as I'd like to believe that Lynch/Frost had a whole extra season rattling around in their heads it doesn't seem likely.
twinpeaks,371ekn,Voduar,9,Sun May 24 05:21:11 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think that seems entirely likely. David Lynch always seems to come in with gigantic first drafts that need a ton of cutting down. The full cut of Inland Empire, his most recent movie, is almost 5 hours long, and that's after apparently cutting 100 pages out of the script and two dozen scenes from filming. The last Twin Peaks movie had something like 90 minutes cut from it as well, enough that there were talks about releasing it in two parts. Given his track record I wouldn't be surprised if he sat down to write nine hours and it spilled over into sixteen."
twinpeaks,371ekn,Rubular,2,Sun May 24 04:15:59 2015 UTC,"I heard there was over 2 hours of deleted scenes from Fire Walk With Me but the ones that we did get (the extra 90 minutes) were just the more ""relevant"" scenes Lynch chose to release"

twinpeaks,371ekn,rhinny,2,Sun May 24 00:10:25 2015 UTC,Bend is awesome!  I try to go out once a year.
twinpeaks,371ekn,bugalou,8,Sun May 24 05:54:00 2015 UTC,I can believe this.  If for no other reason than Lynch's writing and directing style.  The first cut of almost everything he's done is way longer than the final product.  The original approval was for nine episodes and the scripts he wrote for those nine episodes were probably way longer than the average hour long drama script.  Easy to stretch them to 18 episodes.
twinpeaks,371ekn,WilliamMcCarty,8,Sun May 24 17:01:06 2015 UTC,I hope some of the cast members of Psych guest star in a couple episodes. They did such a good job with that episode tribute.
twinpeaks,371ekn,09jtherrien,3,Sun May 24 04:58:26 2015 UTC,So glad to hear they're renovating Twede's. That place has needed some work done on the inside for a very long time.

twinpeaks,371ekn,norunningwater,9,Sun May 24 07:14:54 2015 UTC,"Twedes entire schtick now is twin peaks merchandising. Their cherry pie, however, is actually delicious"
twinpeaks,371ekn,WesleyBaxter,3,Sun May 24 00:10:01 2015 UTC,"I remember when Fenn did an extended q&a on FB right after Lynch quit, she said she believed he would like to go a second season of 9 episodes, and at the time a lot of people wondered where she was coming up with such odd specifics. I don't think we are getting an 18 episode 3rd season so much as a guarantee of a 4th season of another 9 episodes.  The idea of lunch/frost producing 18 hour long episodes by 2016 is certainly a stretch, but over the course of 2 years sounds exciting as hell."
twinpeaks,371ekn,boyonstilts,5,Sun May 24 04:48:08 2015 UTC,"if Lynch has agreed on eighteen, then he's enough story for that, I have confidence in him. Whether it's eighteen or nine, that's fine. Do we know for certain if it's one more season then done?   What worries me is closure. I'm all for Peaks coming back to finish in a way that it never had a chance to, it deserves a proper send off and this season will hopefully be it. But the idea that it could go beyond this season is a bit worrying. I mean, the scripts are already written. There's already an ending written down somewhere. That they haven't outright said 'it's one more then done' could suggest that the ending isn't as conclusive as some might hope it to be."
twinpeaks,371ekn,IvanLyon,2,Mon May 25 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"Hopefully, if they decide to do more than one season, they write each finale with enough closure.  No cliffhangers.   So that each season finale could act as a series finale if it needs to."
twinpeaks,371ekn,sabrefudge,2,Sun May 24 12:48:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I like this. Twin Peaks always felt like it was better suited for short seasons, 8-13 episodes at most. 18 new episodes seems like a whole lot. Another thing I can't wrap my head around is how Lynch is possibly gonna be able to direct all 18 of them, the previous 9 seemed like a huge task to undertake before, but double that? Lynch will be a 70 year old man next year.  I've never heard of anyone under a television show directing that many episodes. I remember Cary Joji Fukunaga directed all 8 episodes of True Detective and it sounded like that was massive work and something they were unable to do again with season 2.   I'm very hopeful for the return of the show and all. But it really felt like season 3 was better suited as a shorter season with maybe 10-13 episodes. I am also genuinely unsure of how Lynch is going to be able to put his all into all 18 of these, I can't barely imagine a young director being able to handle that much work, of course I'm not trying to undermine Lynch as a director, it's just that he's an older man now and this will be the most work he's ever undertaken by far.  Anyways thrilled to hear about the location and that it is being filmed during autumn as well."
twinpeaks,371ekn,givemethatsprinklers,3,Tue May 26 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of anyone under a television show directing that many episodes.   Tom Cherones directed 49 episodes of Seinfeld in a row. Multicam shows are obviously a different story, but 49 is still impressive."
twinpeaks,371ekn,ryanplant-au,5,Sun May 24 08:11:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not to say that isn't impressive, it is. But it's almost not comparable. It's a very formulaic process for sitcoms, they have all their sets ready and things are just sort of working like clockwork when compared to something this.   I do wanna state that I am incredibly excited for season 3 and I'm very hopeful about it all and thrilled that it is Lynch doing it, because it shouldn't be anybody other than him. I just thought a shorter season sounded perfect. Obviously I harbor no ill will towards what Lynch and Frost want to do and will be incredibly excited regardless. I'm just ever so slightly skeptical. Lynch is a master at what he does, it's just to me personally it sounds like so much work for anybody to undertake, but I do trust in his ability to do so, but it'll be a lot of work that's for sure."
twinpeaks,371ekn,givemethatsprinklers,1 point,Sun May 24 10:43:14 2015 UTC,"Valid concerns, but just because they've announced 18 new episodes doesn't mean those will all be released as one season. They could take a break half-way."

Sure, that's mostly multi-camera sitcoms, but, 200+ episodes of cheers, 150+ episodes of will & grace all directed by one man. Also he is 74 years old and is still working. He's directed twenty-seven episodes of The Millers so far and I believe they are slated for another season with him at the helm.  On the single camera side of things. Michael Rymer(53) directed twenty-two episodes of Battlestar Galactica and eight so far of Hannibal. Timothy Van Patten(55) has directed eighteen episodes of Boardwalk Empire, twenty Sopranos, thirty-one Touched by an angel. Jack Bender(65) directed thirty-seven episodes of Lost, Stephen Williams(can't find his age) directed twenty-six.   Lynch hasn't stacked up the pure number of hours behind the camera that these guys have, but he's a natural genius that needed very little training to be at the top of his game. He's a TM guy so I'm sure he can control his nerves and emotions and body to see this through. Eighteen episodes of this will be a walk in the park for Lynch."
twinpeaks,371ekn,jacabo,1 point,Sun May 24 23:26:21 2015 UTC,"Michael Rymer   from what I understand though, that is 52 episodes total over the course of the series, not 52 episodes directed in a row. Lynch will be making all of these episodes in one go, alone. There won't be any breaks he can take while others come in to direct a few episodes in-between.  Again, I feel like I'm undermining the work of everyone with these reply, know that that's not what I'm trying to do. But yes, I know that in sheer numbers there are some TV Directors out there that have done a lot. What I have not seen or heard of, is a serialized drama season with more than 13 episodes where a single director directed all episodes.  That to me sounds like a different beast from being along for a show with 5+ seasons and over the course of them directing what amounts to 20+ episodes, again a lot of work, but very different from doing 18 by yourself in a single go."

Top that off with old school cast drama with Lara Flynn Boyle complaining about the on screen relationship of her real bf at the time (McLaughlin) and Audrey.

I always saw the show as being about the Laura Palmer case, so I'm wondering how the new episodes coming out will work.  I had to watch the movie twice to get it, but I really like it, even more than the show. In the show, you kinda see twin peaks through the perspective of an enthusiastic FBI agent, so in general it seems like a nice, upbeat place. In the movie you see the town through the perspective of a terrified, drug addicted abuse victim. Everything is darker and all the relationships seem lonesome and distant, and it does a great job presenting that. The weirdness is still there, but it isn't humorous like it is on the show.  Its also only $3 to rent on Amazon for the 135 minute version."

twinpeaks,3714g4,davis98,1 point,Sat May 23 23:03:29 2015 UTC,"I did like the episode itself, but even Lynch was trying to wrap-up the bullshit that the other writers had written until that episode. Story-wise it was not good, but if I want to look at the episode separately, then I can say that it was great."
twinpeaks,3714g4,SiddharthaWolf,8,Sun May 24 06:35:05 2015 UTC,"""Fire Walk with Me"" is probably the antithesis of what you hated about the second series, so no worries there. In tone it's most like an amplified version of M's last episode.  I'm with you on this btw, I found the second half of the second series incredibly disappointing. Everything post L's demise was pretty poor in my opinion (except actually I have a personal fondness for the Civil War storyline, can't really explain that one though). Definitely watch FWWM - especially if it was the darker side of the show you liked."
twinpeaks,3714g4,givemethatsprinklers,1 point,Sat May 23 22:05:25 2015 UTC,"It was the darker side of the show that I liked, especially if it can be interpreted psychologically; as in everything was just in the mind of Leland or Cooper, and they had both gone mad.  I love Lynch's films, because their surreal elements are put deliberately in them, and all toward an objective.  Most of today's postmodernist works are written with the writer knowing nothing of what he's doing or where he's going to get to. Lynch's works are not like that, everything in his films exist to tell the audience something, all the elements are there to lead the viewer toward what has been planned by Lynch.  I consider Lost Highway one of the best films ever created, and its script as one of the best I've seen. I watched the movie two times, then I put a big piece of paper in front of me, and wrote and draw all the events, scenes and characters on the paper. I then tried to connect the events and characters together, while checking them again by watching the scenes and trying to get new details. It was 2 AM, it took me 3-4 hours for everything to click for me, and when it did, I couldn't do anything else the entire next day. I was just sitting there, trying to fathom this man's genius.  Twin Peaks wasn't like this at all. Everything was presented to me, every plot point was explained, like all other Hollywood movies that look at their audience as dumb creatures that need to be fed information to understand what's going on."
twinpeaks,3714g4,ctakim,2,Sun May 24 07:37:50 2015 UTC,"From the sounds of it, you'll love FWWM. Just make sure the version you're watching is 135 minutes in length, many people often mistaken The Missing Pieces for the actual movie and wind up seeing the 90 minutes of deleted scenes instead.   I disagree with the people in this thread saying FWWM is NOTHING like the show, it is. It is far darker though and doesn't have those lighter and comedic moments that the show had, and Cooper plays a very minor role in it and that is where a lot of that stuff came from.  But it is still Twin Peaks, it just has a different atmosphere than the show did.  The focus is on the horror of Laura Palmer's last week alive and it is incredibly poignant. You shouldn't prolong watching it. I say watch it as soon as possible, it sounds like it's just the right thing for you."
twinpeaks,3714g4,CarnageV1,1 point,Sun May 24 19:10:01 2015 UTC,"I think of FWWM as the TV show's dark doppelgänger. If you look for a continuation of the lighthearted quirkiness you won't find it (clue in the first scene of the film which is a big tip off). But if you felt a level of discomfort that Leland was held a bit blameless for the abuse of his daughter and his wake was a bit too jovial for what is ultimately a tale of horror and incest, this movie will balance things out. From what you post, I suspect you will find much to admire in FWWM. I hated it when it was first released and I respect it much more now."
twinpeaks,3714g4,EdgarsTeethAreDry,3,Mon May 25 16:52:21 2015 UTC,"I was in agreement with your post until you said the Lodge storyline was 'just bad'. That was the main plot of the entire show, man! As for Windom Earle, I absolutely loved his character, even though the majority seems to hate him with a fiery passion. He might have been a little too kooky and weird, but that was because he was driven into madness in his search for the Black Lodge. Although admittedly, it was largely the finale that made me truly enjoy his character, and that was under the direction of David Lynch.. and I'm not sure if Lynch wrote him into the story or if someone else did. But that's just my opinion, you're entitled to feel how you feel, and that's okay. But the whole thing with the Lodge's is what ultimately makes me continue to think of Twin Peaks and revisit it as often as I do, and ultimately is the central mystery of Twin Peaks, more so than Laura Palmer.. she was merely a victim of the Black Lodge.  I'm glad to read that you enjoyed FWWM, most Peaks fans who have your views on the show itself hated the movie, so it's refreshing to see someone view it for the first time and say it was 'great'."
twinpeaks,3714g4,partiallypro,-3,Tue May 26 12:23:33 2015 UTC,"But it was not. The show was about the rape and murder of Laura Palmer, by the hand of his father, who had gone mad; or that's how I like to see it, before it completely became supernatural and Bob became an existence.  So, now they had explain where was this Bob coming from and all the visions and supernatural elements, so they made up that White/Black Lodge thing.  The show completely became un-Lynchian after they revealed the murderer of Laura. The writers had thought that they had to follow the classical screen-writing rules, which says that if you mention something in your script, you have to explain it or have it later included in your film, because the viewer is anticipating it.  Cooper had talked about Windom Earle, so the writers felt the need to show the character, and explain more of Cooper's background too."
twinpeaks,3714g4,Sabbatai,3,Tue May 26 15:42:44 2015 UTC,The show had been building something more supernatural than Leland simply going mad pretty much since the beginning.
twinpeaks,3714g4,partiallypro,6,Thu May 28 08:53:21 2015 UTC,"Fire Walk With Me is absolutely nothing like the series at all. I can pretty much guarantee you'll hate it if this is your feeling. Twin Peaks went down hill after the network forced them to reveal the killer (they never planned to.) So after that it gets a little campy until the very last episode of the series when things start coming together...and of course it cliff-hangs in its infamous fashion. I think most will agree Twin Peaks is a masterpiece up until they reveal the killer and then again on the last episode (or two) when Lynch returned to direct. There's a deep history of why the show derails in Season 2...some of it was interpersonal relationship between actors (which is why Audrey and Cooper parted randomly), then a spat between Frost and Lynch...and of course network pressure to reveal the killer.  Frost and Lynch compliment each other well, and when one had more pull than the other you can tell...for instance in ""Fire Walk With Me"" it is pure Lynch, and had Frost had input I imagine it would have been a lot more like the show and less surrealist."
twinpeaks,3714g4,damngoodcoffeebob,1 point,Sat May 23 22:11:10 2015 UTC,But that's exactly what I like. I watched Twin Peaks because Lynch is my favorite director (and maybe a little because I loved Alan Wake).

There is still a lot of good in those episodes but you have to swim the mire of James & Evelyn, Nadine and Dick Tremaine to get to them.  I do wanna say though, that I never stopped liking Ben Horne's storylines (until the Donna Hayward thing). Ricjard Beymer is just so goddamn awesome, I could watch him do anything as Ben Horne. The Civil War stuff was funny to me, but it was dragged down because at that point in time it is one of like 6 comedic storylines compared to 1 dramatic storyline. You cant have all fluff and no substance, that's not why people watch this show."
twinpeaks,3714g4,Voduar,3,Sun May 24 16:50:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed, as long as Richard Beymer has the opportunity to chew on the scenery he's golden. Even the civil war stuff is fun to watch."

twinpeaks,3714g4,Voduar,2,Sun May 24 20:26:33 2015 UTC,"I finished the show yesterday, and watched FWWM right away. I couldn't agree more. As soon as Laura's killer is revealed the shit hits the fan. I did like the whole BL/WL thing, I wish they would have just focused on that instead of on Dick, James, Evelyn, and all of the other shit that didn't make any sense. I did like the movie for the same Lynchianism that I like in the show.   But at least Lynch is directing all the new episodes, and they have been given total freedom from the Showtime. So let's cross fingers."
twinpeaks,3714g4,Voduar,2,Wed May 27 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, I agree with you except on the Black/White Lodge stuff and I do think that there were a few episodes in the second half of season two that were good.  The funny thing is that I watched the show completely opposite of how you did. I enjoyed the show so much that I started out barreling through them, staying up to ridiculous hours at night because I couldn't get enough. Then when I got to the second half of season two, it took me forever to get myself to finish it. I couldn't make it through an episode in a single sitting during the worst ones."
twinpeaks,3714g4,LikelyWhisper99,5,Thu May 28 09:05:08 2015 UTC,"It's important to understand the backdrop to season 2. Lynch and Frost wanted to make it a slow lead-up to the gigantic revelation of Laura's killer and finish the season with the mind blowing extra-dimensional twist. But the network execs wanted some kind of ""Who shot J.R.?"" hype to explode around the show, and demanded that they sped things up so that the big revelation would be in the middle of the season and not at the end. So to appease the powers that be, it was condensed and then fluff-stories were added to fill out the season. It's just TV."
twinpeaks,3714g4,Quantumleaper212,2,Sun May 24 00:02:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's great to see that at least today some creators have a freedom in making what they want.

twinpeaks,371ncy,ohhimark108,5,Sun May 24 01:31:06 2015 UTC,17-23 is the questionable sequence of episodes. From then on it's pure quality building to the strongest episode in the series (finale).
twinpeaks,371ncy,Confused_Shelf,5,Sun May 24 01:57:03 2015 UTC,"No matter how cheesy or weird or silly some of the storylines get, I totally, 100% recommend watching all of it. I mean, why not? Twin Peaks is every storyline in it's entirety, not just the first season. I might be in the minority of enjoying the second season for what it is, but I think watching everything is essential to really knowing the show as a whole."
twinpeaks,371ncy,Mezzystar86,6,Mon May 25 03:58:28 2015 UTC,"To be honest you don't really need to watch any more after that besides the finale, which you absolutely should watch. I'd suggest just reading the episode summaries and if they interest you, then give them a watch. For a time (don't remember exactly, only watched them once--it was all I could bear), I wanna say from like 11-15 they are painfully boring and the show just completely goes off the rails. It's kind of fun to watch it descend into terribleness, however, so there is that. Lynch comes back for the finale though and tries to bring it all back together and I think it really works, so you should definitely watch that. Some of the best scenes in the whole show are in the final episode.  EDIT: Whatever you do, if you decide to watch the rest of them, do yourself a favor and fast forward through every James scene. I cannot stress enough how unimportant to the entire plot of the show his storyline is. It may be the worst story I've ever seen on TV and I cannot for the life of me imagine who thought it was worth filming."
twinpeaks,371ncy,Cletus_Van_Dam,2,Sun May 24 02:30:48 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the later half the second season, I recommend continuing to watch. You should see the last episode. It gets good again for the finale."

Everything from BOB's reveal 'til then gets a little corny and there are multiple subplots that just absolutely suck, but it all leads into the finale and it won't be properly appreciated unless you've rode it out to the end.   I can't say it enough, the finale is the BEST part of Twin Peaks, and one of the best things ever made. It's so absolutely incredible and weird and wonderful and terrifying ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

She appears in the final 6 episodes of the series and briefly in the prequel feature film Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. Born on December 24, 1971 she grew up in Twin Peaks, but, after a painful romantic experience that led her to slit her wrist in a suicide attempt, she went to live in a convent. She hasn't decided if she wants to remain in the secular world, but is willing to see what it can offer her. Despite her lack of experience outside the convent, Annie is not naive about everyday sorrows and transgressions. She may be seen as a mirror for FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper. She seems to possess an intangible quality to which he is drawn, almost hypnotically. Annie ultimately begins to represent a dark and painful truth from his past. Subsequently, she is cast into Agent Cooper's urgent quest to elude/capture the progenitor of his increasingly nightmarish existence. In the final episode of the series she is trapped in the Black Lodge by Windom Earle who brings her there as his ""Queen"" after she wins Miss Twin Peaks (Earle was playing a ""sick chess game"" involving real people prior to this). At the end of the episode Dale Cooper is himself possessed by the spirit of BOB, and he and Annie depart the Black Lodge.

The Twin Peaks Rewatch Podcast started a couple days later and I immediately started rewatching the show. They really helped illuminate the creativity from Lynch and Frost, and they didn't pull any punches when it came to the back half of season two (I believe they straight up called it a bad show several times, but they backed it up well).   I urge anyone who's planning to rewatch the show in the run-up to season three to listen to this podcast along the way."

Lynch dropped out because he felt like he wasn't getting the budget he needed to properly make season 3, which was really just a negotiating tactic to gain leverage against Showtime to open up negotiations to a bigger budget. Just a few days ago Lynch announced he got what he wanted and that he's back on board.  Although, either way, Showtime would have gone forward with Twin Peaks. Whether that would have constituted a 'real' 3rd season or not would be up for debate, but season 3 was never not happening."

twinpeaks,36klok,stevebaescemi,4,Tue May 26 18:58:29 2015 UTC,"I think there'll be time. Certainly it'll still go through in 2016, but an increased episode amount may lead to longer production time. They'll have to delegate the budget thay they've come to an agreement on, principal photography and set setup (this shouldn't take too long, as the shooting locale in WA should be the same), write out the entire season, then sign and gather all of the actors they need to read and then go into shooting.  Knowing Lynch, he'll edit it as meticulously as possible, which may add more time. It is a show that I expect will be filmed in full and start showing once editing is down the line, rather than shown while filming goes on.  Laura said I'll see you in 25 years, and maybe they will. He's done this before.  It's happening again."

twinpeaks,36ebsk,ryth,2,Tue May 19 03:34:05 2015 UTC,Is any post involved? It looks like paper with an alpha channel as well as after effects or some other NLE involved.
twinpeaks,36ebsk,StrokeMyBrain,4,Mon May 18 22:25:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, unfortunately working with paper is very, very limiting.   I puppet everything, so all movement is me moving the paper in real-time off camera while I'm recording with my camera. I do try to keep true and consistent with that and I feel it makes the movement more organic.   There are some cases, the reflecting trees for instance, where I adjust in post. Opacity, etc. If you look at the bird head, I attached the head to a pen wrapped in (plastic) green paper. I turned the pen in my fingers back and forth to make the head have movement. I did this all over a piece of green construction paper. I then keyed out the green leaving only the head visible on a transparent layer that I then added to the body. So even when I'm doing effects, I'm doing those effects with construction paper. :)  I work on a timeline of two weeks. I have to release a new video every two weeks so it's a bit limiting and I do need the assistance of some post help."

But, it's clear that they had no handle on the Red Room. As well, Windom Earle was passable when well-written (I liked the concept of him as a foil to Cooper, but, he was never menacing and his goddamn speeches were ridiculous), but in this, he's goddamn insufferable.

I would even go so far as saying that some of that dated feeling was intentional as well, the series goes for the very 50s feel at times and is where a lot of the charm comes from.   Without giving too much away tho, don't let that quirkiness fool you."

A lot of these actors will lose out on reprising their roles but that leaves room for new and interesting characters to step up!"

twinpeaks,36bfwy,Bearmanly,10,Mon May 18 17:30:35 2015 UTC,I wouldn't rule out Kiefer Sutherland. To be honest I can see Sam Stanley's character having good potential in Season 3. Especially since Chet Desmond is gone and Truman's partner is gone too. Especially since I assume plot is going to be focused on The Black Lodge.
twinpeaks,36bfwy,lWTD,1 point,Mon May 18 02:43:41 2015 UTC,I'd like to see him back too. Kiefer is so unpredicatbe these days though. He probably won't even go back to 24 for another season so I don't see him coming back to Twin Peaks. But we'll see.

twinpeaks,36bfwy,sabrefudge,10,Mon May 18 01:13:17 2015 UTC,"Has there been an actual audition or any sort of substance to Andrew W.K. ""trying out"" other than him tweeting that picture of himself next to BOB and trying to get the fans to back him up?  I'm not saying I necessarily approve or disapprove of his idea, I'm just wondering if there has been any real development or any acknowledgment from anyone else involved in the show (despite how early it is in development).  I kind of think they have enough footage of the original BOB actor (Frank Silva) posing in front of mirrors to just digitally insert him into the typical mirror shot as needed.  If they needed BOB to appear outside the mirror, that's where things would get complicated and a new actor would probably be needed."
twinpeaks,36bfwy,RoseCity,7,Mon May 18 03:14:15 2015 UTC,"I would be shocked if Bob is in the new season.  His spirit like we saw inhabit Leland, definitely, but not Bob's physical form or a re-cast.  I think the use of old footage could be cool, but I'm not sure if it's possible."

FWWM really upped the game and it'd be disappointing for the continuation of the show just be a regression to the smalltown kookiness of the initial run. We know what's behind the facade now, and -assuming the new run has an endgame in sight, at least - there's not all that much time left for the story to go back on itself. The cutesy Peaks is dead, and I hope that they keep FWWM in mind.   However, most of the target audience for new series is the casual viewer who remembers Coop, cherry pie and some dwarf guy, not necessarily those of us who stuck around for FWWM. Frost didn't have anything to do with it, either. There's  every chance that the film may just be glossed over. Then again, Lynch isn't the type to care about what people expect from him, and i'd bet he didn't have the casual viewer in mind when he wrote the new scripts. So I wouldn't count Chet out just yet.  I could see Isaak coming back, but I doubt Sutherland would. Bowie is quite ill and I doubt he'd be able to film."

twinpeaks,36apfx,PaulCoffee77,2,Sun May 17 21:29:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just thinking too much into things, but could there have been deleted scenes from FWWM that they held back on releasing?

It started out pretty normal but you knew being the last episode it was building to something.  Ignoring the early ""did X just die?"" moments, when Cooper appears in the lodge and we have the hauntingly brilliant ""Sycamore Trees"" scene I knew this was going to stick with me forever.  I watched that entire 30 minutes mouth open in stunned silence as he slowly navigated his way through that hellhole.  That conclusion too...  Edit: Jimmy Scott singing Sycamore Trees is the very definition of a ""I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore"" moment."
twinpeaks,36a3do,Confused_Shelf,18,Sun May 17 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"For my money, the epitome of Lynchian Twin Peaks has to be S:2 Ep. One, ""May The Giant Be With You."" It just defines what Twin Peaks is all about. Funny, surreal, dark, suspenseful, and full of mystery. Opening with our Lord and Savior Special Agent Dale Cooper shot and bleeding out on his hotel room floor and clinging to life is the greatest season opener ever after how much the audience loved Cooper after Season one. To take that suspense and give it great ironic and surreal humor with señor Drool Cup bringing Cooper's milk and hanging up his phone is just brilliant. Nobody else but Lynch could've given such a suspenseful moment such ridiculous and out there humor. And then the mysticism hits when the Giant arrives right after, and we get our first real Red Room esque moment of WTF AWESOME when Cooper gets the clues to Laura's killer from a member of the nether realm. Ten minutes of hammer dropping brilliance, and ten minutes only Lynch and Frost could've given us together. From there I cant even begin to touch on the darkness that is Audrey begin trapped at One-Eyed Jacks and being almost molested by her father, Albert Rosenfield watching in disbelief as Andy gives himself a concussion, Andy and Cooper solving the hungry horse and smiling bag clues (Doc Hayward forever underrated in the hotel scene), MAJOR BRIGG'S amazing relation of his dream to Bobby that made me tear up, or Ben and Jerry Horne interviewing Hank Jennings about the Leo shooting. But wrapping it all up with the Giant revisiting, telling Cooper he forgot something, and ending on the forgotten Ronette Pulaski waking up and seeing a vision of Bob running through the woods? It's the best ending besides the finale, always gives me chills. It's a perfect episode of television and watches like a Twin Peaks manifesto of campy soap opera, suspenseful thriller, emotional roller coaster, and batshit crazy surreality. Only David Lynch could've pulled off that episode."
twinpeaks,36a3do,Baba_Ganoush_Big_Guy,5,Sun May 17 20:21:45 2015 UTC,"This post really gets it. And that Bobby/Dad scene is one of the finest moments in the show.

twinpeaks,364b7q,Argobast,2,Sat May 16 02:15:21 2015 UTC,"I was just playing devil's advocate, but however you construe the OP's meaning of the word ""text,"" it still functions as a noun. Even if they were referring to an SMS, in this sense it would still be a noun because they would be referring to the message itself, not the act of sending it. Hence, my tongue-in-cheek comment saying that the OP could have just as easily meant ""The text (as in the writing itself) that David Lynch sent to Sherilyn Fenn."""
twinpeaks,364b7q,alchemeron,-6,Sat May 16 02:17:32 2015 UTC,"Except that the usage of ""text to"" leaves little room to misinterpret it as a noun.  You're being cute, but if you're going to be technically correct you have to be both technical and correct."

Because it's the inverted version of the infinitive? ""Lynch's text to..."" You can't have possession of a verb. A text to SF is a (noun) to SF. A drive to the beach is a (noun) to the beach. Stretch the fragment out: ""Here is the text DL sent to SF."" ""I sent a ham to my mother."" By your logic ham is a verb."

twinpeaks,3603xd,LikelyWhisper99,14,Thu May 14 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"I watched the pilot when they had it available for streaming a few weeks back. I think it has less to do with Twin Peaks than some might expect.  Sure there are certain things that evoke Twin Peaks, including the title of the show itself, and an art style rooted in 50s Americana pastiche. But beyond that it's actually much closer to something like Lost or The Prisoner. People quick to say ""That show is such a rip off of Twin Peaks!"" are understandably misguided in that assumption.  That said, I really enjoyed it. If you're a fan of mystery television, especially mystery television with a slice of WTF and science fiction, I can't see any reason not to enjoy it so far. I'm excited to see where it goes. It is probably the best pilot for a show in this vein I've seen in years."
twinpeaks,3603xd,ohhimark108,3,Thu May 14 23:57:21 2015 UTC,The Prisoner is definitely a good comparison

twinpeaks,35vcuo,cinemamacula,4,Mon May 18 18:32:00 2015 UTC,Fire Walk with Me is probably my favorite peice of Twin Peaks that I could get my hands on outside of the second half of the finale. The more David Lynch'ness the better. I love the pieces of lore that Lynch adds to the story so much better than all the horrible crap that was attempted to be added in the second half of the second season.
twinpeaks,35vcuo,Sanity0004,3,Thu May 14 11:09:58 2015 UTC,"Yep. I watched this first, before ever watching the series and was supremely impressed - whether I fully got it or not. Lynch is what drew me in the first place. When the show proved to be way different than FWWM my first reaction was to be kind of bummed. I wanted all of the uncomfortability. All of the small man. All of the black lodge.  Season 2 was annoying in parts. Fuck Josie, fuck James, good god, what's the deal with Nadine? But in the end it's great. Would be extra stoked if the show were more like the film."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,beepingslag,2,Fri May 15 05:02:52 2015 UTC,"Good god, the James side-story is just awful."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,helpful,3,Fri May 15 15:31:26 2015 UTC,"So, think of it like this: S1 of Twin Peaks was very Lynchian. The beginning of S2 was almost drowning in Lynch. But as time goes on it becomes more and more Frost's work as he was the one responsible for the lodge. And then we get that big honkin' Frost in another realm ending.  And here's why I remind you of this: There were two years between ""How's Annie"" and FWWM. So the fans spent two years dwelling on Cooper's future to get a flashback he wasn't in. Worse, it takes place in a nightmare timeline in the past where it seems we only get the evil in everything. I don't think I know anyone who got the positive bits of the movie out of the first viewing. Worse, this is a level of Lynch that one must be properly warned of before engaging in."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,Voduar,2,Fri May 15 08:38:19 2015 UTC,"Here's the most rational reasaon. It makes very little sense if you haven't seen the entire TV show, and if you have seen the entire show, it gives you no real new info. There's a couple new bits of Black/White Lodge mythology, but all of the actual events surrounding Laura are talked about in the show.   Keep in mind, Twin Peaks had only been off the air a couple years, and the people who still cared really wanted to know what happened to everyone after that cliffhanger finale. Even for a first time viewer these days people probably go into it with some vague awareness that there's no resolution. This was not the case in 1993. Imagine going into the theater after two years of waiting for a conclusion to that cliffhanger, and instead you get a movie full of stuff you already knew.   Also, it's a question of tone. Despite the dark subject matter, the Show was still often very light, and always had a ton of comedic moments. Now, I find parts of FWWM very funny, but it is not a light movie. It's a dark inversion of what a lot of people loved in the show. The cops are uncooperative, the diner employees are unfriendly, the implied darkness is very explicit, and hell, even the coffee tastes bad. On top of that, most of the fan favorite characters are absent. No Sheriff Truman, no Andy and Lucy, no Major Briggs, no Audrey, no Pete! Cooper's barely in it, and Donna is a different actress!  I love the movie. Adore every moment of its bruised and broken heart, but it's incredibly obvious why it wasn't acclaimed by the general public."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,GaijinSama,1 point,Wed May 13 23:08:26 2015 UTC,"It reminded me of the glimpses into the dark that the show gave, that were really unsettling alongside a show with a quirky tone. Like when you find out who killed Laura, or the scene with Bob and the couch. It reminded me of Twin Peaks, the town itself, because of how it has this pretty facade that we get glimpses into, and I feel like FWWM is the point where all those moments that grew more frequent as the show progressed finally came to a boil and showed us the seedy underbelly that the town was built on. But this same motif of ""pretty town with dark secrets"" can be scene in a lot of Lynch's other works, so it was nice to see this darkness that was showing a part of itself throughout the show, just like Leland and Laura, and the photograph of Laura with her dead body lining up where the picture seemed to crack. Like I understand it wasn't answering our questions or leaving us with closure but it was artistically original. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ (still pissed about Audrey though)"

twinpeaks,35vcuo,GaijinSama,2,Mon May 25 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think I've ever been more disappointed for a movie than with FWWM.  I watched all the episodes as they aired back when the show originally aired, read the books, the Diane cassette, chatted about the show on Prodigy- I was engrossed.  I was disappointed when they announced FWWM would be a prequel, but still really excited to see it.  And- I was really disappointed.  As someone else mentioned, it was just too dark.  I don't mind darkness, but it seemed like it didn't really connect with the mood of the series.  The biggest disappointment I had was with explicitly making Leland, and not Bob, the killer.  In the series, Leland's presented as being possessed by BOB, but the movie almost seemed to make BOB almost an allegory for sexual abuse.  I rewatched it a few years ago, and I enjoyed it a bit more with no expectations.  I have the box set, but for some reason haven't watched the Missing Pieces yet.  Need to rectify that."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,LostInTheMovies,1 point,Tue May 26 19:16:41 2015 UTC,"I understand that completely. I feel if I watched it the same way you did, I would have been just as disappointed."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,Confused_Shelf,4,Tue May 26 19:51:49 2015 UTC,"I just watched it for the first time last week and here's why I didn't like it.  It isn't what I expected/wanted.  It's worth saying that as soon as I find time I'm going to watch it again. Now I know that it in no way resembles the style of Twin Peaks I reckon I'll probably enjoy it more than I did. Initially I would have rated it a 2/10.  The movie was incredibly dark and grim. Now while I have no problem with that generally, it just felt like such a departure from Twin Peaks which I only finished last month that I couldn't get into it. It was essently 90 minutes of Laura being abused/raped, and that was kind of upsetting.  It didn't have any of the charm of Twin Peaks. Cooper is barely in it (I knew he wasn't the lead going in but I expected more than 5-10 minutes of screentime) and he didn't seem to be in character. All the lighter elements of Twin Peaks (Audrey, Lucy, Andy, Pete, Nadine, etc.) were missing so the film came across as really oppressive.  I fucking love the Pink Room."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,e_x_i_t,4,Wed May 13 21:07:30 2015 UTC,"I was excited to see David Bowie in it. That was a let down. Sheryl Lee did a good job as Laura but didn't even sound like her. Yes we only hear her messages to Jacoby in the show but I expected her spacey/zany voice to carry over. It didn't.  I couldn't ignore the change of actress for Donna. I thought Donna was a perfectly fine character in Twin Peaks but I couldn't tell you if Moira Kelly did her justice.  The opening 30 minutes was just dull. I've since watched a breakdown of the movie and realise that it is supposed to be a doppelganger for Twin Peaks, something I was kind of aware of watching (especially the diner/sheriff's office) but didn't much care for.  The shot where James does a burnout irks me in ways I can't describe (and I don't find James nearly as intolerable as Josie)."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,LostInTheMovies,16,Wed May 13 21:14:19 2015 UTC,"Moira Kelly definitely did her justice, in a way I don't think Lara Flynn Boyle would have been capable of. Lara Flynn Boyle as an actress is fairly icy, reserved, and has a harder edge to her. It worked great for the show, because she was playing a character who's innocence had pretty much just been removed from her(keeping in mind that the FWWM scenes had just happened to her before the show started). She was great because her character went on a journey for awhile where she became more and more like Laura.  That wouldn't have worked at all for the movie, however. In the movie we needed to see her character while she still had the innocence and naivete that Donna had given up by the beginnings of the show. Moira Kelly plays all of those moments perfectly, and presents a character that Laura would feel a closeness and protectiveness for. I don't think she gets the credit she should, because too many people are caught up in the fact that she isn't the original actress."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,Prometheus357,1 point,Wed May 13 23:51:22 2015 UTC,I agree - I think both Lara Flynn Boyle and Moira Kelly do excellent work as Donna and are well-suited to the different stages of the character they play. I'd kind of like to see Donna doppelgangers in 2016 haha. I wouldn't put it past Lynch.
twinpeaks,35vcuo,denalynn2001,2,Fri May 22 20:11:45 2015 UTC,"The departure of the iconic Twin Peaks style was my biggest gripe however.  Twin Peaks was made for TV and while they kept some of the most horror-like scenes I've ever seen in a show, it clearly had a 15 rating. David Lynch seemingly went wild with the restrictions removed and so it was constant swearing and nudity. I sound like such a prude saying that. My favourite show of all time (HBO's Rome) has far worse language and graphic sex than anything in FWWM. The issue is just how jarring it is to hear/see these things in the Twin Peaks setting.  That's all I can think of right now."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,Cockrocker,1 point,Wed May 13 21:18:46 2015 UTC,"Track down the Q2 fanedit, it reinserts most/all (depending on what version you can find) of the cut scenes from The Missing Pieces back into the movie and may help give you a different perspective on the movie."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,PourJarsInReservoirs,1 point,Sun May 17 05:34:16 2015 UTC,"I would argue that while this might be worth doing eventually, Confused_Shelf should give the theatrical cut another viewing first. It sounds like he/she might actually like the film once it's separated from the expectation to be like the show. Watching the fanedit might be interesting but it isn't the film Lynch ultimately wanted FWWM to be and I think it makes more sense to get accustomed to that film first, before looking up alternate versions. Just my 2 cents."
twinpeaks,35vcuo,e_x_i_t,2,Fri May 22 20:09:35 2015 UTC,"I think people didn't like it for much of what people say here. It was a departure from the tone of the show.... However, my additional note is that here we see Laura as a loose cannon. We see her at her most wounded and most weakened state and coming from the show that In its self was very jarring. People expected what they saw on TV up on the big screen. What's curious to me is... Is FWWM A glimpse into what season 3 would end up looking/feeling like, should lynch return.   I personally loved the film exactly as it was. The above is my assumption as to why people are not fans.   🐇"
twinpeaks,35vcuo,Melkor_Morgoth,1 point,Wed May 13 22:25:41 2015 UTC,"As a die-hard fan of the show, my biggest problem with FWWM at the time I first saw it was having a different Donna. I don't think there was any problem with Moira Kelly's performance and I feel like I am way overdue to see it again. I suspect the casting would not be a problem this time, since I feel like I have more distance from the show and could assess the movie on its own merits."

There is a big change in tone as most people have said, but in the show you learn that Laura was in a pretty dark place. It loses the melodrama, but that's ok for me. It's one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. I love the whole start, the Teresa banks story. I could have watched many FBI agents follow bob over many years.   In Australia, back in the 90s/early 00s, FWWM use to be on late night after Sports tonight quite often. My brother and I would dare each other to watch it.

twinpeaks,35rbb8,ohhimark108,13,Sat May 16 02:47:55 2015 UTC,"I think Showtime will move forward with it regardless of David Lynch directing, they have the scripts Lynch and Frost wrote, some of the deals with the actors are done. I think the machine is too big at this point to be stopped by David Lynch refusing to direct. Perhaps some rewriting will be necessary if other actors back out because of Lynch's absence. Mark Frost is arguably a more important factor than Lynch in the grand scheme of things.  I'd much rather Lynch direct and maybe that will still happen, but what are we even moving on to? The show has been off the air so long I don't think much will change if it doesn't happen. No point in not being cautiously optimistic."
twinpeaks,35rbb8,ohhimark108,3,Tue May 12 21:49:19 2015 UTC,"What I meant by ""being dead"" is Lynch's involvement. Should have clarified. Moving on from what? I dunno. Hope?

I was as disappointed as anyone to hear that it wasn't as done of a deal as it was presented to us.   But hope is cheap and not time consuming, and continuing to push for Lynch is probably the best shot we have at Showtime feeling pushing for Lynch is worth it."
twinpeaks,35rbb8,ExplosionsintheEye,3,Tue May 12 23:13:16 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I really REALLY want Lynch to direct, but if they could still use his scripts, and get some of the old directors on board still, I think it would be worth watching still, assuming the unsigned cast don't all drop out"
twinpeaks,35rbb8,citizenpuppet,2,Wed May 13 11:45:05 2015 UTC,"IF Lynch does not come back, I really hope actors like Sherlyn etc dont go through with dropping out too. Everyone should do the best they can without Lynch, and if it turns out shit, I'm fine with sort of ignoring the third season as truly part of Twin Peaks and using the script to tie up loose ends.   BUT  I am still confident Lynch will be back and s3 will be amazing."
twinpeaks,35rbb8,mrwhateverism,10,Wed May 13 18:20:45 2015 UTC,"I would be all about a Lynchian non-Lynch directed season three. What makes Twin Peaks great is not entirely from the mind of David Lynch, like Blue Velvet or Eraserhead were. Lynch only directed seven episodes, including the pilot - and only wrote five. So, losing Mark Frost would be seemingly far more disastrous to a third season. As long as the focus is utilizing the mundane as 'horrific' while surrounded by cool Red Room Agent Cooper canon stuff, I say bring it on. Who needs Lynch for that?"
twinpeaks,35rbb8,rmchole,5,Wed May 13 02:10:52 2015 UTC,The big problem for me with Lynch walking is that apparently many cast members already written into the scripts will walk with him. I'm sure Lynch would do a masterful job directing but I agree that Frost showrunning is more critical. Just would hate to see the scripts they worked on reduced basically to drafts to remove old characters and (you'd have to assume) add in new ones.

But really, to me Twin Peaks without Lynch seems absurd, and I would honestly rather have no series 3 than a series 3 without Lynch. Sure the scripts are written, but that doesn't really mean anything - when the original was being filmed Lynch was constantly improvising things - the best ideas are never on paper they're true moments of inspiration. You won't get that with conventional directors. Lynch may have only directed a handful of the original eps but they are leaps and bounds ahead of everything else, the show wouldn't have been worth watching without his involvement, and the other directors wouldn't have had such strong building blocks to work with (elevating their own work). I think the fans need to be strong and stay with a pure vision of how the show should be, not make stupid compromises, because if we start doing that then it's just going to be taken advantage of. Showtime will go ahead without Lynch, produce something bad and leave a sour taste in everybodies mouth, burying it for good."

twinpeaks,35n8s7,douko,2,Tue May 12 17:04:43 2015 UTC,"I'm watching this comedy show on Hulu called Fresh Off the Boat. It's pretty good, but what sets it over the top for me is that Leland, Ray Wise, plays the next door neighbor. It's great everytime he's on screen."
twinpeaks,35n8s7,sheepcat87,5,Tue May 12 17:13:21 2015 UTC,Watching Fire Walk with Me changed my views on Leland. Initially I thought the same but now I think BOB gave him an excuse to do what he wanted. They were working together rather than BOB being the controlling one during all the horrible moments. Sure BOB would have hurt Leland if he tried to protest but I don't think Leland wanted to.
twinpeaks,35n8s7,Confused_Shelf,3,Tue May 12 13:26:57 2015 UTC,"FWWM was too real and too raw. Leland knew what he was doing, as you said. He knew from the beginning, when Laura was only twelve years old. And when he found out she didn't want him for a ""lover"", when he saw her with other men sexually, he murdered her in a jealous rage. After raping her one last time.  I hate Leland."

twinpeaks,35m8co,douko,11,Mon May 11 17:35:54 2015 UTC,Hm. I was under the impression that anyone who ended up with the ring was screwed.

twinpeaks,35m8co,coolnamehavingguy,2,Mon May 11 19:51:44 2015 UTC,"The impression I had about Cooper and his motivations were that he was kind of the audience's avatar.  He was the character who always did what the audience wanted done.  Normally, when you watch a movie with supernatural stuff, there are omens that characters dismiss as just superstition, and the audience is shouting at the characters not to be so stupid and ignore them (even though, in real life, that's what most people would do).    Coop listened to every omen.  Coop took every precaution, and Coop was just generally likeable and professional and nice to every other character.  There's basically nothing Coop does that the audience would disagree with (aside from with the benefit of hindsight and knowing things later on, like with the ring)."
twinpeaks,35m8co,LittleRudiger,2,Tue May 12 00:26:40 2015 UTC,"This makes sense- Coop didn't have any knowledge of the ring's abilities aside from the fact that bad things tend to happen to those with it, so of course he advises Laura not to take it."
twinpeaks,35m8co,Fictitious_Pulp,2,Tue May 12 00:53:49 2015 UTC,"It's been a little while since I've the film, but doesn't the ring stop Bob from being able to possess Laura?  I remember Mike throws it to her and foils Bob's plan to become Laura.  Maybe the ring is essentially another demon's claim to a person.  Or maybe Cooper just knows that Laura taking the ring in the train car is what causes Laura to be killed, and he's trying to protect her."

According to this article a producer says that, beyond the surface details, the story is dissimilar to Twin Peaks.   ""It's actually nothing like Twin Peaks in terms of the story -- it has nothing to do with Twin Peaks,"" said De Line last weekend at WonderCon. ""What is similar in feeling is there's what appears to be this bucolic, idealized American town that looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting, and then underneath the surface are very dark strange things that are lurking and start to reveal themselves. That's what's similar to Twin Peaks."""

He doesn't say that it's not influenced by Twin Peaks... He says that their story is not like Twin Peaks.

That being said, it's really not that much like Twin Peaks. It's less of an ensemble and more about a guy who gets trapped in a small town surrounded by people with mysterious motives (which I never learned, because I never made it through the book). But the inspiration is there and I'm almost positive the author has credited Twin Peaks for that."

I took a course where we reviewed television shows and one of the shows I was able to review was Wayward Pines. I got the official press kit for the show which contained about the first half of the show (it was only supposed to be 5 episodes but fox messed up and included the 6th). I'm afraid I can't provide much more proof as I had to return the press kit to my professor. Also, there is no reason for me to lie about this on such a small thread anyway. So take that for what you will, it doesn't matter to me if you watch the show or not, but I do highly recommend you continue with it as I found it very entertaining."

One story should negate the other, and almost certainly would have, in the hands of a lesser filmmaker.""  Has there been any other good writing on this point?

twinpeaks,34rofd,jfHamey,7,Mon May 4 02:17:43 2015 UTC,"I think each person is going to get something out of it new, each time they watch it, if they pay close attention.  There's a lot of symbolism in the film and pay close attention to the very beginning and the very end of the film; there's an overt journey that the viewer is taken upon.  I don't want to spoil any insights you might have on your own, but not only is it my favorite film, but—obviously—I think it's Lynch's best work.  It has his trademark weirdness, but it's also accessible.  It's the only one of his films where I think I truly understood everything.  But then, I may not be as insightful regarding his other films.  And you can also see where many of the themes in Twin Peaks came from, most obviously the seedy underbelly of a small town, hidden, but there to find if you look beyond the surface."
twinpeaks,34rofd,Roykirk,5,Mon May 4 02:24:47 2015 UTC,It's the only one of his films where I think I truly understood everything.   I think The Straight Story has a pretty straightforward story.

twinpeaks,34pdz1,mwcope,18,Sun May 3 09:46:52 2015 UTC,It was pretty poorly received. It's much more Lynch than much of the show.
twinpeaks,34pdz1,windom_earle,11,Sun May 3 11:26:00 2015 UTC,That's honestly why I love it so much. Seeing all the characters outside of the comfort and censorship of network television is just really satisfying.
twinpeaks,34pdz1,davidlynchs_hair,14,Sun May 3 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"Also, what the hell was Cooper doing in the Black Lodge at the end?   This is my interpretation of it:  The good Cooper is stuck in the Lodge. The Cooper that got out is a Doppelgänger, probably possessed by BOB. The Doppelgänger took over Cooper's body because Cooper allowed fear to influence him on the series finale. However, through love, he was able to help Laura Palmer from within the Lodge. He might have lost his body, but not his soul."
twinpeaks,34pdz1,ryunocore,12,Sun May 3 15:05:12 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much the take from the season finale, as well.  And, Cooper wasn't invaded by BOB so much because he allowed fear into him, but because he wasn't pure of heart.  Frost has said that a third season (back in the 90's, not now) would have seen Andy go into the Black Lodge to get Cooper because he's the only one innocent enough to leave without being taken over."
twinpeaks,34pdz1,clrobertson,2,Sun May 3 15:46:40 2015 UTC,Do you have a link to where Frost said that?  I've always loved Andy and this just endears him even more to me.
twinpeaks,34pdz1,douko,2,Thu May 7 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"I would also like to see a link to this. I thought Cooper was possessed because he allowed fear to overcome him. It wasn't merely about innocence. At no point is it revealed that Cooper had some shady past and that's why he was possessed. He was possessed because we saw that Annie made him vulnerable to fear.   Andy is a huge cry baby that fears everything from the very first scene of the series.  AFAIK, the only person who seems to be able to 'pass' the test is Garland (Colonel) Briggs. I just assumed season 3 would have explicitly revealed this and Briggs would have been the one who got things done.  I don't recall any of the writers or Frost/Lynch ever verifying that, though."
twinpeaks,34pdz1,TheGumYouLike,2,Thu May 7 21:47:29 2015 UTC,"Well, Cooper did fall in love with and potentially (I don't remember) have sex with his partner's wife.  It isn't hard to imagine that a property of the Black Lodge would be to exploit the misdeeds of anyone who passed through it- and unless his character would have had a huge reveal, I doubt Andy has done anything so morally wrong as to be able to succumb to the forces of the Lodge."
twinpeaks,34pdz1,douko,1 point,Thu May 7 21:53:52 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, you're right. I forgot about the infidelity aspect. It's been years since I've watched it all the way through.  Gonna have to restart it as soon as Lynch is officially brought back on board."

twinpeaks,34pdz1,Spiritimvu,6,Sun May 3 13:16:07 2015 UTC,"What part isn't making sense? I always took it as Lynch having a bit of fun with the fans who look into every little detail for clues. Like, it's a silly, inconsequential, random moment that then has a ton of equally nonsensical clues.  Are you asking about the Blue Rose? We know that Gordon has 'Blue Rose Cases' that he's very secretive about, we can assume those are weird, possibly supernatural cases. But here's a couple other things that might be of interest; a blue rose does not exist in nature. The Air Force investigation into UFOs, that Major Briggs was involved with, was called Project Blue Book."
twinpeaks,34pdz1,GaijinSama,8,Sun May 3 16:16:37 2015 UTC,I heard a theory that the blue rose meant that the paranormal was involved in the case in some major way.  That's why Desmond wasn't allowed to tell Jack Bauer

twinpeaks,34pdz1,MacManus47,7,Tue May 5 14:51:53 2015 UTC,"I believe that's the standard version. The blu-ray box set released FWWM with dozens of deleted scenes and there's a fan-edit that compiled the scenes and used the original script to insert them in chronological order. I believe it's called ""the Q2 fanedit.""  It's about 3.5 hours and is pretty marvelous."

Now, on to your question. It is because of the influence the Black Lodge has on people easily corruptible. That is why Leo Johnson sees Windom Earle with a corpse-like appearance.

twinpeaks,34jis1,AKluthe,39,Fri May 1 18:08:58 2015 UTC,I don't think I'll ever understand the hatred for the Civil War reenactment subplot. I honestly thought it was one of the best things about season 2.
twinpeaks,34jis1,emuman_92,23,Fri May 1 18:27:54 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't hate the Civil War reenactment plot, for as much crap as it gets.  As for the subplot where James ditched town..."
twinpeaks,34jis1,drknight,7,Fri May 1 19:49:56 2015 UTC,"That was awful. I was kind of hoping we would never hear much from James again, and then that ridiculous, pointless, dull sub-plot began to form. Now I really dislike that character."
twinpeaks,34jis1,Corvandus,6,Sat May 2 06:46:52 2015 UTC,EVERYONE hates James. I feel like that was the point.

twinpeaks,34jis1,trashbagman,17,Sat May 2 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as far as the second half of season 2 goes I liked that one. The silly and weird subplots were wayyyy better than all the super boring ones."
twinpeaks,34jis1,drknight,11,Fri May 1 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"I loved Ben Horne's descent into, and return from, madness. That was great. I was surprised to learn how many people disliked that."
twinpeaks,34jis1,fernguts,0,Sat May 2 06:45:14 2015 UTC,"If the comments in this thread are any indication, the only person who didn't like it was the person who made the comic."
twinpeaks,34jis1,sabrefudge,3,Sat May 2 12:11:46 2015 UTC,I didn't like it...  though it was still the best of the absolute mess of subplots the series was tangled up in at that time.  I'd watch a whole season of them playing Civil War in Ben's office before watching another moment of some of those other dull subplots.  I was so happy when things seemed to get back on track again... then the series just ended.
twinpeaks,34jis1,mcslayer,1 point,Sat May 2 13:45:04 2015 UTC,"I made the comic and I specifically said I did like it, though I've spoken to a lot of people who thought it was dumb/weird."
twinpeaks,34jis1,shortbitcoin,8,Sun May 3 06:07:51 2015 UTC,"The civil war subplot was pretty fun to watch imo. Atleast it provided some entertainment whereas the James running away fiasco was long, boring and drawn out."
twinpeaks,34jis1,cassbryn,3,Sat May 2 00:19:07 2015 UTC,"I loved the Civil War obsession subplot. It fit in with the overall story arch, that Horne was losing his mind, but it did so in a hilarious and surprising way."
twinpeaks,34jis1,cr2224,5,Sat May 2 06:36:42 2015 UTC,"Before I really knew who anyone was, while I was watching the show for the first time, I would immediately be excited any time ""Directed by David Lynch"" appeared.  It meant I'd be watching something a little more artful than most TV.  I'm glad he's had a hand in the writing for season 3, at least.  And I'm going to add to the chorus of the Ben Horne subplot praise.  I thought it was decent; it fit the tone of the show better than some of the other wackiness."
twinpeaks,34jis1,awicybob,3,Fri May 1 23:57:11 2015 UTC,"I feel like I got so invested with the character development, they didn't have to be doing anything in particular; I was just hanging out with my friends."
twinpeaks,34jis1,Iswitt,2,Sat May 2 01:59:10 2015 UTC,The civil war reenactment was one of the best things ever!
twinpeaks,34jis1,skullhair,3,Sun May 3 02:55:18 2015 UTC,"... It's also like most of Season 1, in which Lynch only directed two of the eight episodes. (But to be fair, he was around in general more often than he was in the second season). I thoroughly enjoyed Season 2. Some subplots weren't as good as others, but generally speaking I loved it."
twinpeaks,34jis1,owencrump,2,Fri May 1 18:44:54 2015 UTC,"I actually posted about this elsewhere...a lot of sources are framing the story like Showtime are being big meanies and refusing to give Lynch what he deserves.  Lynch's demands might also be unreasonable for a highly advertised, big budget limited series on Showtime.  From what I understand, he already has the scripts in...so they would only be losing him as a director.  Which only made up a handful of episodes across the whole series.  On the other hand, I would like to see his influence on the show.  I think his presence did have a big impact on season 1. (And executive meddling was detrimental to season 2.)"
twinpeaks,34jis1,colorcorrection,2,Fri May 1 19:43:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, a lot of people put too much influence on the directorial aspect. While that's important, what is far more relevant is Lynch as a showrunner. It's not just episodes he directed. It's being around to oversee the thing."

People would easily pay a fair sum for them.

twinpeaks,33sj2l,AnotherCrazyOne,6,Sat Apr 25 05:01:09 2015 UTC,"Well, OP here. Yes, there's a bit of humor, but it's the actual quote from the episode that hit me. Who are we to judge? I may not be transgender, but I have plenty of skeletons in my own closet. We are often too sensitive to allow humor in. Too soon?  Really though, for Bruce to make himself so vulnerable to judgement is remarkable. I can't fathom how much courage that must take. He may be a woman, but he's got balls. And yes, I understand that too may bristle some to say, because of the humor."
twinpeaks,33sj2l,GaijinSama,0,Sat Apr 25 21:07:09 2015 UTC,"So, about transgender individuals. Here's a picture of someone pretending to be one for slightly comedic effect.  edit jesus, I didn't expect this comment to upset people as much as it did. I'm sorry to cause any frustration, I was merely pointing out that comparing a real person's drama in a joking way to a fictional character(who is a crossdresser, not a trans woman) was a bit distasteful."
twinpeaks,33sj2l,GaijinSama,-4,Sat Apr 25 05:52:11 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, it was a great moment in the show, and very understanding. But there's something about your post, or any post equating another person's real life drama with lighthearted fiction, that always strikes me as a bit inappropriate."
twinpeaks,33sj2l,aperturedream,4,Sat Apr 25 07:19:41 2015 UTC,"How is Twin Peaks ""lighthearted fiction""? And personally I found this to be one of the earliest more understanding portrayals of a transgender person in the media."
twinpeaks,33sj2l,GaijinSama,4,Sat Apr 25 14:15:57 2015 UTC,"You know, I'm now in the awkward position of defending a statement more than I felt it required. Because, honestly, I'm not very personally invested in this specific instance, but in general I find it distasteful to take someone's real life drama and, in a slightly joking way, say it reminds you of this fictional event.  That being said, the character of Denise is great, and very progressive for 1990. Nothing I've said in this thread is meant to disparage the character or the writing."

twinpeaks,33rl36,trebuszek,11,Sat Apr 25 07:49:00 2015 UTC,"It's fair enough. Not very Lynchian if that's what you are looking for. The similarities to TP is just that it's a little town and the protagonist is a special agent + the 50's look. And then there's a nurse that they are trying to make as weird as possible, but she's simply a bad actor and creepy."
twinpeaks,33rl36,audunvangen,3,Sat Apr 25 08:36:08 2015 UTC,"The first episode was okay... I think it has more promise than 90% of main network shows, although I realize that's not saying much. I used to work with the production designer, so I'll probably watch the whole thing either way just to support him!  Like someone else said though, it's not as Lynchian as people are claiming. The source of inspiration is obvious though - for example, the sheriff's assistant/secretary was given the last name Moran."
twinpeaks,33rl36,MsDirected,4,Sat Apr 25 12:44:23 2015 UTC,"Not too bad. It has more in common with Lost, Silent Hill or Alan Wake than it does Twin Peaks if you ask me (although there are clear references: long shot of a ceiling fan, character saying 'is it happening again?') If you try and compare it to Twin Peaks then you won't enjoy it."
twinpeaks,33rl36,BlackTendrils,6,Sat Apr 25 13:45:26 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest. I'm not enjoying it. I'm watching the first episode as i type this. I hyped myself up after reading the many ""inspired by Twin Peaks"" stories and comments. It's strange, i'll give it that. I normally enjoy strange, but I want fascinating characters to help deliver the strange goings-on. I hate Matt Dillon's character. He's the lead and I am notconnecting with him at all. I'm feeling more for for his wife and son than I am for him. This show has none of the ""quirk"" I was hoping for. Just weird and mysterious, almost in a government cover-up sort of way.  I don't know. I'm drunk. I feel like a bitch. I hate this show because I want to watch TP season 3, I think. I keep saying I hatethis character and show, but I really don't HATE it. it's just ok. I think. I'm not finished with the first episode. It's probably pretty good.  edit-just finished it. feels more like x-files to me."

I'm hoping it doesn't come to that though :(   I hope if Lynch is gone for good that at least he gives the project his blessing so that all the cast will return. I'd rather see a Mark Frost directed take on his + David's scripts than nothing at all, personally.   It won't be mind blowing in the way that an announcement of 9-Lynch directed episodes was, but, I'd still take it."

Upon a second viewing it just ate it up and went out a rewatched every one of his movies all over again, now I love his work. Like creamed corn I had developed a taste for it. Now I can't believe I ever disliked his work."
twinpeaks,33kojj,TheWarpedOne,7,Thu Apr 23 15:37:12 2015 UTC,"Well here's how I look at it compared to so many shows that try to go down the supernatural route. The majority of shows today just force everything down your throat. I think what set Lynch apart from the bunch, at least for me, was that what he showed was very indirect. It left room for the imagination to come up with the story, rather than the story just shown to you. Although it's touched on that Twin Peaks is sort of a hot bed for magic and supernatural activity, its never really directly put into focus. It's that subtle hint here and there that does it for me. They never blatantly come out and say here are some demons... Here is some magic... It's all indirect and I think that is something very special that is missing from modern Hollywood and television in general. The imagination and speculation on what was barely touched on can make the show for me or break it."
twinpeaks,33kojj,TheWarpedOne,2,Sat Apr 25 00:13:52 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, totally. Agreed."

twinpeaks,33kojj,windsostrange,8,Thu Apr 23 22:21:48 2015 UTC,"And it's not because of the angles or the lighting or the mood or the cuts or anything it's that real life genuinely has this strangeness buried within every word every interaction and so few people get to SEE that and then show us what they see and David Lynch is one of those people  And witnessing that is so valuable to the rest of us  Wanna know ""the scene right here"" why David Lynch has to direct these episodes?

twinpeaks,33n7r6,potatodos,15,Thu Apr 23 22:03:10 2015 UTC,"I think that sometimes, especially in moments where BOB was fully in control, people (his victims especially) would see, for perhaps a split second, BOB instead of Leland.  As for who was in control when, that's very difficult to answer. I think much of the time Leland was doing things, but BOB was directing him, egging him on, and Leland would sort of retroactively justify it to himself or explain it away as a brief period of confusion, false memories, bad dreams, etc. until he eventually was forced to confront it. I also think BOB could jump into the 'drivers seat' and take over Leland more directly when he wanted to, but part of the fun for him was manipulating Leland into doing bad things because it meant more pain and suffering for him to reap.  It's very fuzzy how the whole connection between the two worked, but that's kind of how I see it."

twinpeaks,33n7r6,poopypoopboobs,3,Fri Apr 24 00:01:04 2015 UTC,"Few can see BOB's true face: only the gifted and the damned.  Also, watch FWWM and then watch The Missing Pieces. They put a lot of things in perspective."
twinpeaks,33n7r6,ryunocore,2,Fri Apr 24 11:40:44 2015 UTC,"BOB was visible to some people, sometimes.  You see an example of that in FWWM.  Don't want to spoil it, but I think you'll get a better idea of that once you see the movie."
twinpeaks,33n7r6,clrobertson,2,Fri Apr 24 03:31:28 2015 UTC,"I believe there's a certain type of person who can see BOB when he's in control.  Laura and Ronnette would be a couple of examples.  Anyhow, Laura seems to understand (after a point, I'm sure in the beginning it wasn't so) that when BOB was doing his thing to her all those years that Leland basically had nothing to do with it.  She never seems to hate Leland or blame him for the goings on.   This could have been a more recent ploy by BOB, showing Laura how much he torments her father, and promising to stop if she accepted him fully.  Leland killed Jacque, but it was a turning point in the BOB-Leland connection.  Leland could go no further in satisfying BOB's lust for pain and suffering.  While BOB had been in control as they killed the hookers, Leland was in control when he kiled Jacque - He had crossed the line of murder of his own free will, and could be corrupted no further."
twinpeaks,33n7r6,ConradBHart42,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:09:27 2015 UTC,Laura didn't know that Leland was Bob until very late. In Fire Walk With Me she escapes Bob and runs down the street and realizes just then that Leland could be Bob after he is seen exiting the house. I could be wrong but I think that's within a few days of her death. So it would seem to me that when Bob is present it is physically him.

twinpeaks,33f5f1,heresmything,18,Wed Apr 22 00:44:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I am worried David Lynch is using the budget as a reason to back out. That he has cold feet. Maybe he feels too much pressure, or maybe he thinks it won't work now. This is my fear.   I completely understand not wanting to compromise on the show budget, but he's not giving any compromise elsewhere... Showtime needs to make money on the deal too, they can't pay wages with goodwill and indie cred.   I would like a conclusion to this now, either David Lynch is on board or not. I want to know if we have a show or not.   I waited DECADES for the unreleased FWWM footage, I was overjoyed when season 3 was announced. Now I feel like someone took a shit in my froot loops.  Tired of being on tenterhooks I guess.   Same thing happened last year with Art Bell, he ""came back"" and quickly had a falling out with Sirius so the show ended. Really disappointing. Maybe Showtime is the problem, but I don't think it's feasible for David Lynch and Mark Frost to take this to Netflix for example, I don't think they legally can.  Also, Wayward Pines looks shit. Seeing comcercials for it, and not Twin Peaks season 3 depresses the shit out of me."

twinpeaks,33f5f1,TweetPoster,10,Wed Apr 22 00:45:26 2015 UTC,"It seems like there are two narratives being bounced around on the internet: ""Lynch won't do it because the budget is too small"" and ""Twin Peaks is going ahead with or without him"". No coincidences here, since these are the respective mantras of Showtime and DL's negotiators.  In my view, DL's stubbornness is completely legitimate and wholly outweight Showtime's concerns. I'm on my first re-watch of the series now, and the budgetary problem is obvious. In the Pilot and first season, DL seems to be getting what he needs fiscally, and as a result we get these great establishing shots on-location, vast sets, and the pacing of the show is flawless. Later in the show the budget seems much more limited, and that plus the time constraints surrounding the show's demise makes for a noticeable reduction in quality. DL ought to pull out rather than re-enact the substandard."

If DL guiding the project means more critical acclaim and viewership, it also means better chances for beyond season 3. If Showtime is really willing to move on without Lynch, I imagine he won't be in any rush to write more episodes for them.  What you're saying is valid. Lynch could totally be holding out for pie in the sky, plus it's possible absolute control over the revival could backfire into overindulgence. But Lynch directed all of the best episodes from s1 and s2, and I have no stake in Showtime from a financial perspective."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,sonofsolomon,11,Wed Apr 22 03:58:03 2015 UTC,Lynch also left the show to work on other projects during season 2. The budget wasn't completely why it suffered.
twinpeaks,33f5f1,steampunkjesus,11,Wed Apr 22 02:00:22 2015 UTC,I'd leave too if executives decided to hurry the reveal of Laura's murderer.
twinpeaks,33f5f1,ryunocore,4,Wed Apr 22 11:34:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they messed that up, the reveal should have taken years. That said, many of the subplots sucked... all that Pine Weasel, Little Nicky, bullshit. Also the efforts by other writers to restore the mythology using Dugpas, Owl Cave felt a bit forced... compare that to FWWM's subplots of Deer Meadow, corrupt police, Cole's blue rose cases... that is some cool shit and it's all Lynch  Windom Earle could have been amazing, but it was done with no feel or mystery. Still a good character David Lynch and Mark Frost could bring back properly.  The world of Twin Peaks most people care about is Laura Palmer, Agent Cooper, LMFAP, Red Room, Audrey Horne."

Thank you for contacting us. We were saddened to read David Lynch’s statement, since we believed we were working towards solutions with David and his reps on the few remaining deal points. SHOWTIME also loves the world of Twin Peaks and we continue to hold out hope that we can bring it back in all its glory with both of its extraordinary creators, David Lynch and Mark Frost, at its helm.  We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback with us.  Sincerely, SHOWTIME Customer Service"
twinpeaks,33f5f1,nein_danke,2,Wed Apr 22 21:22:42 2015 UTC,"I hope it does happen, but if it doesn't I want to read those season 3 scripts darn it! Somebody leak them if this deal falls through."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,TamerlanTimbaland,11,Wed Apr 22 22:08:31 2015 UTC,"How do you know they're penny pinching vs. DL being unreasonable?  Everyone on this subreddit needs to stop acting like they have any idea what Showtime has offered to pay and what Lynch is asking for, and whether or not it's reasonable based on absolutely no information."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,kurwa_,3,Wed Apr 22 11:12:37 2015 UTC,"Well, partly it's because all of the reports and insider info on the negotiations has implied that Lynch balked because the episode budgets weren't high enough, not because he was asking to be paid more.   But Lynch is a very particular director. He prefers to work with no studio/corporate interference. I know Showtime has said they would leave him alone and let him do what he wanted, but I also think with the amount of money Lynch might have asked for they probably felt like they should have some control over the project."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,GaijinSama,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:20:56 2015 UTC,And those production estimates weren't discussed at all before Lynch publicly announced a third season?
twinpeaks,33f5f1,alsoye,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:19:00 2015 UTC,"In the same way that none of the cast contracts had been discussed before the announcement. I mean, most of the cast didn't find out until after Showtime and Lynch/Frost went public. As we can see, Lynch's contract wasn't finalized before the announcement. I think a lot of things were probably just handshake agreements."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,GaijinSama,2,Thu Apr 23 14:50:58 2015 UTC,"It's harder to throw money at a show like Twin Peaks, which is/was going to be a short-run one-off dealie, than something like GoT which gains momentum/viewers over time, i.e. BR/dig sales and long-term subscriptions. Paying a trillion dollars for a one and done doesn't make much fiscal sense.   That said give Lynch whatever he wants you dead-souled corporate bastardpeople."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,Argobast,2,Thu Apr 23 15:14:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think Twin Peaks S3 is going to pull Game of Thrones numbers, it could, but it seems far fetched. I can see it being True Detective big."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,TamerlanTimbaland,3,Wed Apr 22 20:11:19 2015 UTC,"The after-market is tremendous though. I've purchased TP in VHS, LD, DVD both times and on Blu."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,tronbrain,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:11:55 2015 UTC,"That's nice and all, but who are they negotiating with? Lynch himself? His attorney? From the way Lynch put it, he is definitively OUT, and whatever negotiations are taking place do not involve him. Will McNabb's tweet confirmed what we already know.  I suspect 14 months of negotiations was enough for Lynch. If they could not work it out in 14 months, they would not be able to agree in 14 years. The chasm was probably too wide.  I think this is SHOWTIME's way of stringing the fans along hoping to keep this thing alive while they find a way to get to Lynch and pressure him to accept their terms."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,IvanLyon,3,Wed Apr 22 23:39:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think they're trying to get to Lynch any more, they're just biding time before they feel things have died down enough, and then they can get on with making the show. But they want to look like they fought hard to get Lynch back. It should be plain sailing for them now: without Lynch they can pretty much do what they want, I can't imagine Frost fighting for much.  They'll be hoping for the attitude loads of fans are starting to develop as they rationalize Lynch's exit: 'well, he only directed a few episodes of the original run' and 'well, at least he co-wrote it so we're still getting his vision' etc. By the time the show is about to air, the hype will probably be back and they'll make enough money for it to have been well worth it.  Could someone explain the deal that was made? Am I right in thinking that CBS (related to or own Showtime) own the rights to TP? If so, how come no one made a Lynch-less Peaks revival before now? It's not like a company would give a damn about having the creators on board. I guessed that Lynch/Frost had some kind of say-so on anything to do with making more of them (and Lynch's not wanting to do it before now explains that 25 year gap), so how did the whole deal not fall through when Lynch walked? How do they get to air the show and keep the script?"
twinpeaks,33f5f1,tronbrain,3,Wed Apr 22 22:35:32 2015 UTC,"I think your analysis is right on. SHOWTIME has to make it look good because they probably have every intention of following-through on this with only Frost involved (and likely the majority of the actors). ""We don't need David Lynch,"" must be what they're thinking internally, though their public face is still, ""We're negotiating, trying our absolute darndest to bring David back on board!""  As for the deal, it must have something to do with the original contract Lynch and Frost negotiated when they first did Twin Peaks in 1990. They must have gotten a good deal on rights, considering nobody at the time expected it to be anything other than a 2-hour of the week one-off self-contained television movie. There wasn't really much at stake in those negotiations. Now, there is a lot more at stake. The rights were originally ABC's, and then CBS bought the rights and produced the Gold Set, the BluRay of FWWM and The Missing Pieces, etc. CBS really built the property into what it is now."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,IvanLyon,3,Thu Apr 23 00:23:10 2015 UTC,"do they get to keep the scripts because they were co-written by Frost? It just seems like a weird situation to get into. I'd wager he's been getting offers to do more Peaks since the mid-nineties. After twenty years, he finally gets down to it, spends four years writing scripts for it. Then the deal breaks down, and he walks. How come a)Showtime get to have anything further to do with Peaks and b)they get to use anything Lynch wrote for it. I know it's a co-write and Frost is still involved, so that's probably explained, but does Lynch get remuneration for that work? I'd be pissed if i'd protected my show's legacy for years and then end up being the writer (unpaid, presumably?) on a hack production of new episodes that may well tarnish the legacy. At least take your script with you, make them come up with some crap on their own."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,tronbrain,3,Thu Apr 23 00:43:56 2015 UTC,"No question about it, the situation is a mess."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,Spiritimvu,2,Thu Apr 23 00:56:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. I don't see how they could have negotiated the situation where things would move forward without Lynch's involvement. It makes no sense. Either Lynch is involved, or the whole thing is off. Somehow it seems that is not the case."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,GaijinSama,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:09:33 2015 UTC,"For me!, this seems like a massive publicity stunt for the new season, im willing to bet Lynch was always gonna do it but they needed to stir up a bit more hype."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,Spiritimvu,5,Thu Apr 23 01:37:12 2015 UTC,"That's.... ridiculous. You think they needed more hype? You think people weren't excited already?   I honestly think Lynch's reaction was genuine. I think he generally backed out, either due to cold feet or budgetary concerns."
twinpeaks,33f5f1,TamerlanTimbaland,2,Wed Apr 22 07:36:27 2015 UTC,"That's....my opinion, and why not stir up more hype? all publicity is good!, either way we all get more Twin Peaks! so yay!"

A vision I had in my sleep last night, as distinguished from a dream which is mere sorting and cataloguing of the day’s events by the subconscious.  This was a vision, fresh and clear as a mountain stream. The mind revealing itself to itself.  In my vision I was on the veranda of a vast estate, a palazzo of some fantastic proportion. There seemed to emanate from it a light from within this gleaming radiant marble. I’d known this place, had in fact been born and raised there. This was my first return. A reunion with the deepest wellsprings of my being.  Wandering about, I noticed happily that the house has been immaculately maintained. There had been added a number of additional rooms, but in a way that blended so seamlessly with the original construction, one would never detect any difference.  Returning to the house’s grand foyer, there came a knock at the door.  My son was standing there.  He was happy, carefree, clearly living a life of deep harmony an joy. We embraced, a warm loving embrace, nothing withheld. We were in this moment, one. My vision ended. I awoke to a tremendous feeling of optimism and confidence in you and your future.  That was my vision of you.  I am so glad to have this opportunity to share it with you.  I wish you nothing but the very best in all things."

Also note the synonyms: ring and circle which are frequently used motifs in Twin Peaks.      Brig(gs): briɡ/ a two-masted, square-rigged ship with an additional gaff sail on the mainmast. informal a prison, especially on a warship.     Could be another reference to his military background and/or foreshadows Coop's imprisonment in the Lodge.      edit:formatting"

twinpeaks,338jrc,blizeH,5,Mon Apr 20 14:37:57 2015 UTC,"1: No clear consensus, but I think within the show it's explained mainly by Bob. From a psychological standpoint, you can also see it as signifying the major personality shift Leland goes through. His hair turns white, all of his grief starts to go away. It's also when Bob seems to take more drastic control of Leland; he becomes much more manic after that.  2: I think what happened to Josie is similar to what happened to the Log Lady's husband. If you ask me it's one of the weaker aspects of the show's mythology. I think the writers(which didn't include Lynch for that bit) were desperate to bring back the Red Room mythology and couldn't think of a good way to do it. Her death has always struck me as silly and desperate on the part of the writers.  3: I don't think Cooper knew what to think of the Giant's warning. He knew it was a bad omen, but I think he was hoping that he'd be able to protect her. I mean, he was there, and all the cops were there, he probably thought he could handle it.  4: It's never revealed who was in the woods, nor even hinted at. But I think it might be safe to assume it was one of the Renault brothers."
twinpeaks,338jrc,GaijinSama,2,Mon Apr 20 15:36:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the detailed answers! :)  I did see the Josie/Log Lady comparisons but wasn't entirely sure still how it came about. I think you're right that it was a bit sloppily done though, and not explained well at all.  And fair point about the Giant's warning, I guess for the audience it was pretty obvious what would happen, but like you said maybe he figured if it was well policed that Windom Earl wouldn't be able to get at her. Makes sense that it was one of the Renault brothers too... not sure why I didn't think of that!  Bonus question (sorry) but you clearly have a great insight into these things - was Windom Earl possessed too? And if so, by whom?  Thanks again :)"
twinpeaks,338jrc,GaijinSama,2,Mon Apr 20 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think Windham was possessed, I think he was just obsessed. He'd clearly been piecing together info about the Black Lodge ever since his time with Project Bluebook, and wanted to be accepted by the beings in the lodge. He thought he understood them, and how to impress them, but it turns out they really didn't care about him at all."
twinpeaks,338jrc,GaijinSama,2,Tue Apr 21 00:56:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks, sorry I should've clarified that I meant from this image - or is that just how evil he's become that he would have an expression like that? His eyes and teeth look very strange though. I wasn't sure if maybe the Windom Earle we saw was already an evil doppleganger, dating back to when he investigated bluebook.  But yeah, good point and I thought that was quite interesting at the end... the way Bob just completely disregarded Windom even though he was clearly very intelligent and could've been very useful. I guess messing with Windom wouldn't have been as fun for Bob as messing with Cooper."
twinpeaks,338jrc,GaijinSama,2,Tue Apr 21 09:14:29 2015 UTC,"You know, I think that's just Leo Johnson hallucinating, or simply perceiving how evil Windham is, or the evil he's surrounding himself with. Laura sported a similar look fora moment in FWWM, when she visited Harold, and we know that she wasn't possessed. I think it's just that certain people can sense the presence or proximity of the Black Lodge and it's denizens."
twinpeaks,338jrc,Coldarc,2,Tue Apr 21 14:04:18 2015 UTC,"Ah! That makes perfect sense too, thank you :)  I still haven't seen FWWM but I'm very keen to. Thanks again for the insight!"
twinpeaks,338jrc,MenuBar,2,Tue Apr 21 14:14:13 2015 UTC,"Oh! Well, a bit of warning before you see FWWM: It's much darker than the show. Everything that's implied in Twin Peaks(the drug use, the promiscuity, the incest) is shown pretty explicitly in the movie. It also doesn't feature most of the cast of the show(a lot of them, but most of them got cut out and are in the deleted scenes), and very little of the humor people loved in the series. It angered fans on it's original release, though it has since found a following. I personally love the film, think it's one of the best things Lynch has done(and I'm a huge Lynch an), but it is an ugly, bruised, beautiful film."

Disappointed in both parties for announcing what was nowhere near a done deal. Now we're going to see the production limp on with more than a few missing characters, Showtime are going to get so much shit they'll wish they'd never done it and even if they pull off a miracle and capture some faux-Lynch directing magic, people will just be thinking 'if only...' . Everyone loses.   I'm interested in reading how it ends and i'm sure i'd watch the show at some point, but i'm not paying for it in any form."

He was right about the DVDs though, so I'm not sure why McCrabb would be wrong, but it seems that either he or the cast is currently mislead.

twinpeaks,32wpoe,A_Hard_Goodbye,11,Fri Apr 17 11:16:36 2015 UTC,"DL said in Lynch on Lynch that Peaks was stylistically supposed to be a marriage of the 50s and 90s, something like a marriage of both times. I think they did a bang-up job.  So I like your question: will the cast wardrobe be a marriage of the 50s and the 2010s? It'll be interesting to see."
twinpeaks,32wpoe,MaudeVindaloo,5,Fri Apr 17 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't knew that, but now as you say it, true to you. But I would say marriage of the 50s and 80s, the 90s were young at the time.

twinpeaks,32voqv,shortbitcoin,10,Fri Apr 17 15:50:34 2015 UTC,No coincidence that David Lynch directed that episode. Chilling and touching and surreal all wrapped up in a world of darkness and confusion. Save Twin Peaks.

That's what's kind of interesting to me.   With some, it manifests really blatantly, like the old guy expressing his condolences to Agent Cooper. That guy's mind isn't just (sub?)consciously connected to the other world, he's actually left the back door open.  (Random thought: There's that idea that children are more connected to imaginary worlds than adults are--they can supposedly see fairies and whatnot. What must the kids of Twin Peaks be like?

There could very well be continuing negotiations on this that will take some time. Until Showtime makes a definitive statement, I'll hold out hope."
twinpeaks,32z5wy,skullhair,4,Fri Apr 17 23:44:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as has been stated, Lynch didn't walk away from Mulholland Drive. It had been completed and was actually making it's way towards a full season pickup, but then Columbine happened and networks rejected a ton of shows that featured even a little bit of violence.  But I am still hopeful, and here's why; In 1999 Lynch was working with Criterion on an Eraserhead DVD release, but an overeager Criterion employee let loose the word that negotiations were ongoing, and Lynch backed out. He prefers these things be done quietly. I think the announcement and then radio silence indicates that he is actually still in talks, and he was just trying to light a fire under Showtime."
twinpeaks,32z5wy,GaijinSama,3,Sat Apr 18 01:25:46 2015 UTC,It took years to bring us the hope for a 3rd season.  It can take months to have news about it.  (and it can be a good thing to keep hidden from public some info about it)
twinpeaks,32z5wy,Erdnal,6,Sat Apr 18 10:32:19 2015 UTC,So dramatic.  It'll happen and if it really truly doesn't then at least the original series will remain untainted.  No matter how much you think he's a God there is no guarantee this will be great.
twinpeaks,32z5wy,muffinsaka,2,Fri Apr 17 23:43:48 2015 UTC,"No, come on. The silence is a good thing. Every source so far has said that they're negotiating. If this dispute is resolved and the show goes on, we're probably in for a lot more silence. This is complicated and it's going to take a while to sort out. The fact that Lynch has been silent throughout the backlash as well as the cast saying he's still in negotiations, after almost two weeks, says that Showtime is willing to make compromises for him. If they were not, Showtime would not still be saying they are trying to win him back and he would not be telling the cast they were still negotiating. I know we all wanted Showtime to call Lynch up on day one and tell him they were sorry and that he could have whatever he wanted, but that was never very realistic. It will take longer to straighten this out than it would for it to fall through."

twinpeaks,32plzs,the-velocirapper,7,Sat Apr 18 12:10:07 2015 UTC,"I might be rather alone with my opinion, but Lynch IS (partly) on board, he did write the scripts with Mark Frost. In my book, they should aim for Lynch doing 2 or 3 of the episodes. This would work just fine, as most of season 1 and 2 did. The problem of the middle of season 2 was that lynch didn't have anything to do with the series anymore, not that he was just not directing... I'm sure this has to do with Lynchs salary, and isn't just about the production budget, i mean, seriously, how expensive can TP be in terms of production/shooting, compared to other profilic cable shows?"
twinpeaks,32plzs,themx,10,Wed Apr 15 20:31:37 2015 UTC,"I've heard that he wants to do it on film, which would be significantly more expensive than doing it digitally."
twinpeaks,32plzs,tronbrain,8,Wed Apr 15 21:02:44 2015 UTC,"Well, it would be more expensive, but this would still be a tiny percentage of the whole deal.

This being the reason for this situation would be absolutely crazy..."

Google Play doesn't have it and I'll wager iTunes will come up empty as well. I know Joss Whedon (who wrote it) isn't a huge fan of it, so he's probably not pushing to have it made available. You can get a copy of the DVD for a few bucks, the Blu-Ray will set you back around $10-15. If you Google, you might find an ""alternate"" source, but I can't speak to that."

You could sign up for a free month of Netflix' DVD service, rent it and cancel, or buy one of the used ones on Amazon, which would be just a tiny bit more than the cost of renting it."

Plus, if it's your thing, Kristy Swanson is seriously smoking hot and wears a lot of spandex. Even if that's not your thing, it's a fun movie with some great ridiculously over-the-top performances by Paul Reubens, Lake Perry, David Arquette and Rutgers Hauer."

twinpeaks,32cpfq,davis98,54,Sun Apr 12 18:04:26 2015 UTC,"The way Sherilyn and the rest of the cast have rallied around Lynch is inspiring. There are no selfish motivations here. They could easily sign up for Showtime's Lynchless attempt and make a quick buck, but instead they're supporting him and his vision.   If we didn't know it before, we know it now - this is a very special group of people."
twinpeaks,32cpfq,TheHellOfItAll,6,Sun Apr 12 20:03:52 2015 UTC,"Im 100% behind the cast, and mean no offense, but I think its fair to say that all of the cast, save for Kyle and LFB (noticeably absent form the video), peaked doing Peaks. They can all get regular acting work, but I think for them what they really want is a chance to work in prestige again, in roles they find to b respectable with a someone behind the camera who's truly an autuer."
twinpeaks,32cpfq,ziggykareem,4,Mon Apr 13 14:37:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly. They're doing it for the art of it, which is the best reason to do it.  I don't think Kyle is as free to speak out on the issue as the rest due to already having signed a contract with Showtime. As for LFB, who knows? I don't think anybody expects her to be back on board really."
twinpeaks,32cpfq,TheHellOfItAll,6,Mon Apr 13 16:51:00 2015 UTC,"It's most likely that the reason Kyle hasn't commented is because he's under contract. It's at least been confirmed by Sherilyn that he's upset about this too, so I don't see why else he wouldn't   That's what I've been feeling about LFB too. Anyone know why? Was there some sort of falling out?"
twinpeaks,32cpfq,trashbagman,3,Mon Apr 13 17:10:37 2015 UTC,"I suppose we can't really know for sure, I've always just assumed she wouldn't because she didn't return for 'Fire Walk With Me', and she and Sherilyn didn't get along.  Crew members at a convention some years ago stated that the Audrey/Cooper romance storyline was changed because LFB didn't want MacLachlan - who she was dating at the time - having 'love scenes' with Sherilyn."

twinpeaks,32b3ct,chekhovscricketbat,-3,Sun Apr 12 16:00:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think it hurts Showtime. I'm a huge TP fan, but I'm not going to pretend it's a hot property in 2015."
twinpeaks,32b3ct,Melkor_Morgoth,7,Sun Apr 12 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"There's more at stake here than just the show itself. Feature film directors are increasingly being courted by TV networks. If Showtime can't make it work with David Lynch, and with that happening after having announced the show and made a huge splash in the press (both in the initial announcement and the recent drama) that may jeopardize their ability to approach other directors for future projects."
twinpeaks,32b3ct,ProfSwagstaff,0,Sun Apr 12 16:23:49 2015 UTC,"But Lynch isn't some ""hot"" up-and-comer. And he's recognized as an auteur, but I wouldn't say he's beloved by most cinephiles. I hope with all my being that this happens with Lynch on board, and I'm disappointed that it's not the sure thing it seemed to be only months ago. But I don't think it hurts Showtimes long-term cachet."
twinpeaks,32b3ct,Melkor_Morgoth,3,Sun Apr 12 16:29:23 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter if he's an ""up-and-comer"" or not. Doesn't matter if he's ""beloved by most cinephiles."" Neither of these are strictly relevant to the point I'm making. Directors hear that a veteran filmmaker tried to work with Showtime but was told that the budget he would need = taking a royalty cut up front, and no agreement could be made, that will jeopardize their ability to attract other talent they want to work with."
twinpeaks,32b3ct,ProfSwagstaff,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:36:30 2015 UTC,"Seems like business-as-usual to me, which can go either way. Geniuses and idiots are sorted out after the money's been counted. But I'm not really arguing against what you're saying here. Good points."

twinpeaks,32b3ct,SWEETBRO,3,Mon Apr 13 15:16:56 2015 UTC,"...why did they try to sign it then? It'd be a huge boost to their prestige, which they sorely want. And it's a public embarrassment to have a near-universally admired creator accuse you publicly of being cheap."

All of us are gonna be back together as a family again and it's gonna be amazing!  - Love DKL   And she started screaming and crying with happiness.  Sherilyn and the other cast members were so excited to be all getting back together and working with Lynch again.  Revisiting the story and the characters and the town, and doing it all together again.  Their hopes got boosted so high... and have now been dashed back down again.  It must have been crushing.

twinpeaks,325pc1,Cardow,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"That's interesting about him wanting more time. This is the first I've heard of time not just money being an issue (I missed the Q&A.) I can imagine this being a bigger sticking point for Showtime. More money is relatively easy to pony up. But if they want it broadcast by a certain date and Lynch wants more time, that could be tough."
twinpeaks,325pc1,Ghopper21,3,Fri Apr 10 21:14:02 2015 UTC,"Yes, but remember that in show business, time very literally equals money. The day to day running of the show will be one of the most expensive things, and I can really see it being something important to Lynch. I'm sure he does not want to feel rushed, since he has such an organic and improvised way of doing things. So really in a way it all comes back to money."
twinpeaks,325pc1,Ghopper21,2,Fri Apr 10 21:48:25 2015 UTC,"I take your point, but there could be a difference in kind between extra production money that Lynch wants versus the financial knock-off effects of Lynch wanting more time.  Just thinking out loud here, but let's say Lynch is asking for the broadcast to be delayed 6 months to give himself more time for the production. That costs more money for the production, but that could be the easy part. The delay may be infeasible for Showtime for other reasons, e.g. they have a huge marketing plan pegged to the current schedule, or they have important cable distribution contracts coming up and want to use Twin Peaks as a bargaining chip, or Showtime have promised foreign rights on certain time scales, or whatever. Yes, all of that ultimately comes down to money, but in a different way, i.e. not simply money that Lynch needs for the production."
twinpeaks,325pc1,LittleRudiger,2,Fri Apr 10 22:10:24 2015 UTC,"No, I know that time is also an issue, but the more time he wants the more it will cost him financially, and on top of that we know they're not giving him as much as he wants for production."
twinpeaks,325pc1,Ghopper21,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:24:56 2015 UTC,"All the more reason for Showtime and Lynch to resolve this asap. They still need to lock down a ton of cast. The quicker they do that, the quicker they can actually get to filming and the less risk of a delay further down the line.   I'm sure Lynch and Showtime, back in October, were expecting that by this time they'd be in late pre-production with shooting right around the corner."

I mean, if V For Vendetta can get away with not premiering on the 5th of November, Twin Peaks can air a few months late. I mean, if you want to be technical, '25 Years Later' was last year(following the timeline of the show, which takes place in 1989)."

twinpeaks,325bm8,LittleRudiger,2,Sat Apr 11 02:48:10 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people keep getting so confused and angry over the use of the word ""reboot"".  They call it a ""reboot"" because that's exactly what it is.  I think people are confusing the word ""reboot"" with the word ""remake"".  The two words are not synonymous, nor are they mutually exclusive.  It's true that Hollywood has put out a lot of reboots that are also remakes over the past decade or so... but still... not all reboots are remakes.    They are two different things.   A ""remake"" is when filmmakers are recreating the same story over again, redoing a project from scratch.  Starting from the beginning. A ""reboot"" means that they're taking a dead or dying franchise and bringing it back to life after an extended period of inactivity.  Either through a remake or through a continuation.   Which is literally the definition of what they're hoping to do with Twin Peaks.  The show has been off the air since 1991.  There has been some books and DVD sales, but no new films or television additions to the franchise.  Now, after all these years, Showtime is hoping to breath new life into Twin Peaks and bring it all back to continue the story.  Mark Frost even said that he doesn't consider this continuation to be Season 3.  He thinks of it as an entirely new volume in the saga.  So it's an entirely new chapter in a franchise that has laid dormant almost 25 years now, a sudden burst of effort and interest from both studios and audiences after a long period of nothingness, hence why the project is considered a ""reboot"".  TL;DR: The new Twin Peaks is being called a ""reboot"" because that's exactly what it is.  ""Reboot"" does not mean ""remake"".  Nobody is calling it a ""remake"".  Another word for this type of reboot would be a ""revival""."
twinpeaks,325bm8,ErikaeBatayz,2,Fri Apr 10 20:32:45 2015 UTC,"It's semantics. It can be labelled a reboot.   A reboot does not automatically mean remake. A reboot can be a resuscitation of any dormant franchise.   Star Trek '09 is a reboot, but not a remake, as it has sequel elements to the original series. Even garbage like that short lived Knightrider series are reboots, but not remakes, as they carry over story elements from the original series."
twinpeaks,325bm8,LittleRudiger,-4,Sat Apr 11 04:43:17 2015 UTC,"A reboot does mean that all previous continuity is discarded though.  Batman Begins and Casino Royale are reboots.  Star Trek '09 is not a reboot specifically because of the sequel elements you mentioned.  This new season of Twin Peaks, assuming it happens, will be just a new season and not a reboot."
twinpeaks,325bm8,westcoastmaximalist,4,Sat Apr 11 00:14:58 2015 UTC,"Oxford:   ""Something, especially a series of films or television programmes, that has been restarted or revived: British television had a big hit with the reboot of Doctor Who""  Hell, I don't know why I didn't think of Doctor Who. That's one of the biggest examples of a reboot. It was a dead dead franchise after that special in the 90's with the actor from Withnail and I. It got rebooted in a new style while remaining in continuity. Star Trek '09 is a reboot. Batman Begins is a reboot.   A reboot can be a continuation or reimagining of an old franchise, or a straight out remake. The only common point is that it is a reviving a franchise. In the case of Twin Peaks, it is a reboot in the sense that it is a sequel made over twenty years after the last entry in the franchise (Fire Walk With Me) in what has otherwise been, by Lynch's own admission, a series ""dead as a door nail""."

If some indie game the vast majority of the regular population have never heard of, Star Citizen, can raise $75 million, Twin Peaks could do better."
twinpeaks,31zv2a,skullhair,12,Thu Apr 9 21:42:42 2015 UTC,"This has been brought up before, and this is a horrible idea that will never happen. There's a difference between an indie game being crowdfunded, or even Veronica Mars being crowdfunded and then distributed by Warner Bros, and a television network asking for fans to pay for a television show they'll be broadcasting.  Seriously, if Showtime asks us for money, I will lose all interest in a Twin Peaks reboot. They have the money, but I'm thinking Lynch may not be interested in working with other corporate interests anymore."
twinpeaks,31zv2a,GaijinSama,4,Thu Apr 9 21:49:02 2015 UTC,"Even worse, a pay television network. So not only would they be asking for crowdfunding money to make the show, you'd then also have to pay somewhere between $10 and $15 a month to see the finished product."

I, for one, think Lynch will end up doing it and is playing a hard negotiating tactic."
twinpeaks,31zv2a,skullhair,2,Thu Apr 9 21:53:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. I'm beginning to think it isn't just money. I'm starting to think Lynch has had second thoughts about working on television with studio interference.

There's a reason he reuses cast members for different projects, and has worked with the same producers/editors/cinematographers for decades. But what I think has happened is that his experience with Twin Peaks and Mullholland Drive(and earlier, Dune) has soured him on working with studio involvement. Since Twin Peaks he's done more and more smaller, personally financed projects, weirder projects like selling coffee or making music or reporting on the weather. He's just been doing the stuff he's interested in without people telling him 'no' or how he should do things.   So I think in this case he's either getting cold feet, or he's frustrated with studio interference."

At about the 1:00 mark, Dourif explains exactly what happened on Dune to make it such a failure in Lynch's own estimation. It seems clear. Without sufficient budget to film something the way Lynch believes it should be filmed, the result will be cheapened and disappointing, as happened with Dune. And that is a lesson that Lynch will never forget, or a mistake he intends to repeat.  When Lynch talks about final cut authority, that includes control of the budget as well.   I didn't have final cut on that film [Dune]...So, that's the big lesson. Don't make a film if it can't be the film you want to make. It's a joke, and a sick joke, and it'll kill ya."

He seems to believe Dune could have been a more successful film if only there were no interjected studio mandates which interfered with his original vision.   With this Twin Peaks season 3 business, showtime is apparently all for handing Lynch and Frost the reigns in allowing them to deliver the story they intend to, they just can't agree on how much money that will take."

Sources said Showtime was willing to kick in more coin but asked for concessions in other areas, including the profit participation definitions for Lynch and Frost.""  So, the situation seems to be as previously theorised - they've put in the hard work and delivered, but to make what they want, Lynch and Mark Frost have to take pay cuts. And according to the article, Frost was surprised that Lynch left and is still committed to making the show. I don't think Lynch is greedy, but he knows how much he's worth to the show, and I'm convinced this has to be a leverage move - just based on Frost still being involved, I'm assuming the paycut wouldn't be too drastic."

If Frost made a big stink as well and also said he was leaving, it would all be over. Instead? Silence. Lynch has a history of fighting TV execs. With Mulholland Drive, the TV series, he got so fed up with the notes from ABC he quit and vowed never to work in TV again. He said TV people must be aliens or something like that. He has a plan and he's working that plan. You don't spend years coming up with S3, write the scripts, location scout, and plan the book and then just walk away.

twinpeaks,321u9e,cheyenne04,7,Thu Apr 9 22:12:08 2015 UTC,Frost seemed to hint that it would most closely resemble season 1. Having all the scripts done suggests lots of care put into the plotting. The second half of season 2 was very made up as they went along.
twinpeaks,321u9e,heresmything,5,Thu Apr 9 22:36:54 2015 UTC,"Indeed, it's a very interesting question.   Well, we know it'll be digital - although not Sony PD150 digital, à la Boat. If I had to try to imagine how the surrealist/Black Lodge sequences will pan out, I'd imagine them looking a little like his recent Came Back Haunted video for Nine Inch Nails.   Can't imagine any resurgence of his industrial metal as music or ambient sound given Peaks' history with Badalamenti's score, although I'm sure there'll be plenty of new sound FX work. Hey, who knows?   In general, I expect it to be mostly along the lines of Fire Walk with Me, but with the greater scope of 9 episodes there should be more room for humour and jauntiness (coffee, cherry pie, dancing). It would be very exciting; Lynch has had years out of the game and he could do just about anything.   Here's hoping, of course..."

twinpeaks,322v2l,heresmything,19,Fri Apr 10 03:16:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is going to stop supporting Lynch and let Showtime do what it wants with his series anytime soon. The longer this goes on, the less people will support Showtime, not Lynch."
twinpeaks,322v2l,reggaejunkyjew,5,Fri Apr 10 04:10:59 2015 UTC,They'll never be any backlash against Lynch from me. He's been through this $hit before and I totally support his decision to stand true to his vision. This is not his first trip to the circus.
twinpeaks,322v2l,JamesonJenn,6,Fri Apr 10 10:02:19 2015 UTC,"I think most fans of TP and certainly the most active/vocal are huge Lynch fans and know how important he is for the show. I definitely don't see a general turn against Lynch ever happening. I mean he left the show in season 2 25 years ago and I think the general opinion is still that the networks shouldn't have forced the show to reveal Laura's killer.  Pretty much the only thing that salvaged that season after that is Lynch's return for the finale, which brought the show back on track right in time for it to be cancelled. I just don't see how any rational person can  side with showtime over Lynch on this one. I know we don't know how much he's asking for or even truly what the money is for, but they compromised his artistic vision for the show by making them reveal the killer just because ratings weren't great, and then they cancelled it anyway. I don't blame him for wanting total freedom on this, and I truly believe that's the only way it will live up to our hopes/expectations. Network executives only ever care about the money being made, not the quality/artfulness of their product. Directors/writers/creators often do care about that quality over money, and Lynch is one I'd confidently say falls into that category. But I also think he's one of the most unique creative minds alive today, and having his uninhibited continuation of one of his greatest works would be more rewarding to the fans but also more valuable for the company in the long run even if they have to pay a little more to get it started.  Again, we don't know what was asked for. But without knowing, I think turning against Lynch would be pretty absurd."
twinpeaks,322v2l,Flamgirlant,5,Fri Apr 10 05:34:00 2015 UTC,"There won't be any backlash against Lynch, he's well known to be an auteur. He's been burned badly at least twice so if the conditions aren't right he won't do it and really he should be respected for that. Showtime don't have a show without Lynch, he's the talent. It's his name that is associated with Twin Peaks even though many others contributed to it, and while Mark Frost added some much needed grounding and structure to the show he was always living in Lynch's world not the other way around."
twinpeaks,322v2l,librix,4,Fri Apr 10 11:56:05 2015 UTC,"But that still leaves them with a huge problem, which is that if they proceed they will have to do the show without him (and, apparently, a huge swath of the cast, probably requiring extensive rewrites - and we don't know yet if Mark Frost will stick around). So no matter what, they will have to decide between doing the show without Lynch (doesn't seem to be much of an option at this point), dropping it (in which case they look like fools for rolling out the way they did in the fall), or conceding to his demands. Because I don't see any way that Lynch will budge. He wasn't bluffing when he walked, so the ball is in their court."
twinpeaks,322v2l,LostInTheMovies,2,Fri Apr 10 03:26:39 2015 UTC,"no doubt Showtime can't win. What I'm saying is, Lynch's support will peter out at some point and then what? The project becomes radioactive and the public interest goes away. S3 becomes a punchline that only angers fans."
twinpeaks,322v2l,LostInTheMovies,2,Fri Apr 10 03:36:25 2015 UTC,"Maybe so. I'm holding onto hope that Showtime will bite the bullet and give Lynch what he wants, on the basis that the financial risk of producing the show is less important than the hit to their reputation if they don't produce the show."

twinpeaks,322v2l,trashbagman,11,Fri Apr 10 19:27:16 2015 UTC,"That's a very entitled view point you have. Artists are not obligated to make art just because other people want them to. Lynch did not feel sufficiently equipped in both time and production funds to make the project he wanted to. He's spoken many times before how in the times where he couldn't make the project he envisioned it absolutely crushed him. He doesn't owe you, Showtime or the rest of the world anything, especially if he feels like it would just end up being a disappointment to him.   So never, to answer your question. That's never going to happen."

twinpeaks,31xf2k,jasonthe,3,Wed Apr 8 22:32:26 2015 UTC,"Ugh, yeah the ""1 year 4 months"" thing is really strange. Sounds like he put his trust in SHO (because of his relationship with the president), gave them the rights, then they weren't actually willing to pay for it to be done right.  I'm curious what is going to make it so costly, though. It seems like Twin Peaks shouldn't cost more than shows like Homeland or Masters of Sex (or House of Lies which has 2 film stars). Fire Walk With Me only cost $10 million, while Michael C Hall alone got paid over $20 million every season of Dexter."

I can see how shooting on location can be a big plus for creating the world of TP amongst cast, crew, and production members. I'm sure it stokes his imagination as a director/artist as well and allows for the unexpected which created moments, not to mention characters, of genius in the original. Showtime needs to stop being cheap and get behind the series."

If Lynch and Frost have written these nine episodes as a way to end the show properly, then I can't see that there's all that much time to mess about with introducing loads of new people; there'll be enough to catch up with on the ones we already know. If this new season is leaving the door open for a continuation (and I really hope it isn't) then yeah, we could be getting a whole new slew of characters.  My ideal S3 would be an FBI (Stanley, Albert, Jeffries) centric take on the town as Coop reappears from the Lodge 25 years later, Chet Desmond in tow. Leland as Bob's preferred form, healthy dose of waiting room Laura and another doppelganger role for Sheryl Lee, have the end goal be shutting off/destroying the Black Lodge, or offing Bob, at least.  I really hope that they don't ignore FWWM in the show canon. It really raised the stakes and I don't think it would be genuine to revert to the twee familiarity of the series (not completely, at least). FWWM showed us what Coop is up against and S3 should be them attempting to put an end to what haunts the town."
twinpeaks,31vvqi,IvanLyon,4,Wed Apr 8 16:03:54 2015 UTC,I just figured that with 25 years having gone by it'd be unnatural for there not to be some new characters. But I imagine (and hope) things will go basically how you've described.

The first one was mostly the same, but the second one deviated and, along with the third movie, they've started to make weird references that sort of insinuate what's happening in that timeline has happened before.

twinpeaks,31svs5,iscmarkiemark,3,Wed Apr 8 02:06:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I like Leland as Bob. Leland was evil awesome in his own way. I feel like they could maybe do a back story on bobs earth body and cast a younger version maybe, then for maybe the footage of Frank Silva from the 90's for the present/modern day occurrences. WEhthey could even do 3D mapping like they did for Paul Walker in F7. lol Idk just like brain storming. Man I hope this happens cannot believe something like financial agreements weren't hashed out before announcements and even partial casting.."
twinpeaks,31svs5,Argobast,7,Wed Apr 8 02:46:04 2015 UTC,"But... Bob never had an Earth body. He was in Leland. The long haired Bob is his real appearance from the black lodge, only seen in the real world by certain individuals (Leland first, then in daughter).  ""Evil"" Leland was only ever Bob.  I assume the show will open with Bob still in Cooper's body? Perhaps he'll jump to somebody else once the real Coop escapes the Black Lodge? They could use old footage if we ever see Bob in the lodge, or even a double (if you shoot him from behind)"
twinpeaks,31svs5,sodameow,5,Wed Apr 8 02:59:15 2015 UTC,"Shit that's right.. damn. He's just the entity that the very select few see(Leland, Bobby's dad?, Sarah..daughter). I think because we view him as humanoid in the Black Lodge I still identify him with human backgrounds as messed up as he is that I wonder what his in depth back story could possible be. Watching nutty Bob moments was the best parts imo. Even in Fire Walk With Me scenes showing Mrs. Tremond, BOB, and MFAP was by far the best scenes in the movie because how abstract and weird they are it makes you want to know more. If this 3rd season happens(it will I really do feel) and is a success I could see them doing an entire mini-series on how this ""Black Lodge"" started. Thanks for the long read."

twinpeaks,31svs5,Flamgirlant,5,Wed Apr 8 06:30:48 2015 UTC,"Good for all of them for being vocal about it. It's true. The only people who even come close to Lynch as far as making TP what it is, are Badalamenti and MacLachlan. And even then, I think a lot of the intrigue brought on by Cooper comes from Lynch's direction, and I know Badalamenti worked closely with Lynch in making the ST. But it is 100% his vision. Lynch being on board is the difference between this being an absolutely wonderful revival and it being a sad attempt at continuing a show that should've been left untouched."
twinpeaks,31svs5,willrowley,18,Wed Apr 8 04:47:35 2015 UTC,I don't think you're giving Mark Frost enough credit
twinpeaks,31svs5,tzage,4,Wed Apr 8 06:05:58 2015 UTC,There's a good chance that that is true. Part of it is just that Badalamenti and Lynch have such a unique style of their own that I'm familiar with. I don't really know what Frost's style is.  I'd love to hear specifics of what you think his influence was/is. Just because I genuinely do not know.
twinpeaks,31svs5,Binary101010,17,Wed Apr 8 06:12:04 2015 UTC,"Frost is the storyteller.  Lynch has a great imagination but couldn't tell a TV-style story to save his life. Frost understands how to put together an episode, make sure all the characters get enough screen time, build arcs, create cliffhangers, etc., all the nuts-and-bolts stuff. His contribution is less flashy, but the show could never have been as commercially successful without him."
twinpeaks,31svs5,Flamgirlant,2,Wed Apr 8 10:44:40 2015 UTC,Is frost still going to be directing at least?
twinpeaks,31svs5,willrowley,2,Wed Apr 8 16:36:27 2015 UTC,I don't think there's been any word from Frost since before Sunday's events.
twinpeaks,31svs5,Flamgirlant,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:37:20 2015 UTC,Thanks!   Lynch has a great imagination but couldn't tell a TV-style story to save his life.   Why do you say this though? I know Frost has way more TV experience and I think that him writing the more grounded aspects of the show is the most obvious conclusion to come to. But who's to say Lynch couldn't tell a TV-style story?
twinpeaks,31svs5,trashbagman,2,Thu Apr 9 01:01:33 2015 UTC,"Maybe he could. There's a first time for everything. But the man is nearly 70 and has spent at least the last 20 years in his own crazy avant-garde cinematic dream world. I think he will still need Frost's skills in conventional story structure. Lynch's successful mainstream films have all been written with other people.   I intend all of the above as a compliment to Lynch and Frost, btw!  Anyway, the info on the importance of Frost's contribution is all in the Lynch biography ""Beautiful Dark"", a great read and well worth checking out if you want to know more."
twinpeaks,31svs5,Flamgirlant,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:13:19 2015 UTC,"Ah, I should definitely check that out! Lynch is one of my all-time favorite directors, possibly my absolute favorite, but I tend to not dig much deeper than his actual movie/TV work. He seems like an interesting guy though so I'm sure I would enjoy that.  As far as whether or not he would/could do his own show at this time in his life, I agree with your sentiment - I just don't see it happening. In fact, considering he made IE in 2006, I assumed that we would not even see another film out of him until I heard he was writing for TP again.  You may know this, but Mulholland Drive was originally intended to be a TV pilot and was left with an open ending, but when it was rejected he added an ending and made it into a film. I think MD is near-perfect, but I would've loved to see the TV show that came from it. As much as I love even the most bizarre of his work (specifically: Inland Empire), I think that the TV format would've given him more room to build an atmospheric world like TP, letting the dark surrealism creep in rather than having it right at the forefront from the start (like it is in a lot of his movies). I think having those lighter, more ""normal"" moments make TP a lot more relatable than some of his films. That sense of some sort of sinister, foreign presence in an otherwise normal world really is just the perfect balance of dark/creepy and light/cheerful. Again, Badalamenti was a huge part of making that feeling so powerful. And also, I'm sure a ton of that balance is owed to Frost. But it would also be really interesting to see what Lynch could do on his own."
twinpeaks,31svs5,girlafraidx,9,Thu Apr 9 01:37:08 2015 UTC,"willrowley said it well :). One of the great things about Twin Peaks is how it comes from a really true partnership between Lynch and Frost. Lynch's contributions are flashier and more exciting, but Frost is really the core of the soap opera part of the show. It was him who could tie Lynch down to a real TV plot and give him his format to tweak and make into something really exciting. David Lynch has been quoted in saying that Twin Peaks is at least 50% Mark Frost. We need Lynch right now. There's a fire inside of him and that fire is what really brought Twin Peaks to life. But it's much more than that. I mean, one of the reasons the red room seems so incredible when you first see it was because you'd never expect things like that to come out of a soap opera. It's a combination of two art forms that otherwise never cross and it brings out the best of both worlds. Though Lynch's movies are wonderful and great, if the entire show was up at that level  or surrealism it would lose the appeal that's so specific to Twin Peaks. And that's why Frost is great. It's two great artists doing what they do best and working off of each others strengths to make something fantastic neither of them could do on their own. Lynch is essential. Frost absolutely is too, but he's not saying he's gonna quit, so now is not that time to talk about that so much."
twinpeaks,31svs5,ImPlayingTheSims,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:38:50 2015 UTC,"I always thought that the light, soap-opera plots contrasting with the dark surrealism felt a lot like what Lynch did on his own with Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive, which I guess is why it's hard for me to place where Frost's input lies. I could easily see TP being solely a Lynch project aiming to put some of the themes from BV into a more commercial, TV-friendly format.  It makes sense that Frost would've carried the weight of the more ""normal"" storylines. But I can look at so many important aspects, quirks, and storylines of the show and assume (with reasonable certainty) that they are directly from Lynch. That, combined with a loss in quality when Lynch left, makes it easier for me to give him the most credit for TP's success.  Just to be clear, I'm not saying that I think that I'm right when I think like that, I actually think your post is probably 100% accurate. No argument here, just wanted to share my thoughts - it's just like willrowley said, Lynch's input is flashier, which probably makes Frost's input underrated and underappreciated. I'm sure he was absolutely crucial to the show, I just sometimes forget that's the case I guess."
twinpeaks,31svs5,ex_astris_sci,2,Thu Apr 9 01:13:46 2015 UTC,"you (and everyone) should read the book 'reflections' by brad dukes. it's a compilation of interviews he conducted from many of the actors/actresses, frost himself, tv producers, people on set, etc and it takes you from the beginning to end of twin peaks and it gave me a new appreciation for frost's involvement and just a more cohesive understanding of the show, and appreciation for it as well :)"

twinpeaks,31unrn,iscmarkiemark,3,Wed Apr 8 07:57:00 2015 UTC,"Last fall my mom introduced me to Twin Peaks, a show she had been trying to rediscover for almost 25 years. She had watched it a few times when it aired back in the early 90's, but could not remember the exact name when trying to find it years later. See back then she was really busy raising myself(I am 32 now), my sister and my two brothers so even though she remembers all the hype around the show back then over the years she just couldn't remember the name. Well anyway last Thanksgiving weekend we were trying to find a good show to binge watch. I came across this IGN article(see below) of what to watch over Thanksgiving break and the first recommendation I see on the list is TWIN PEAKS!(sad to see the blurb now about 2016 :/ now, at the time I must have overlooked this)  So I read the description out loud ""fever-dream small town...murder mystery captivated the entire country...launching star Kyle MacLachlan into instant fame.."" it immediately caught her attention then she asked for me to show her who Kyle MacLachlan was. She shouted with excitement , ""OMG I think this is THAT show!!"" We started watching it and she was completely thrilled. Little did I know that within the first few episodes I would be reminded of a terrifying image[linked vid] that was tattooed in the back of mind from when I was a young child. Seriously the second I saw it my heart raced because over the years I had wondered what TV or movie featured this scene I had to pause it and freak out. My mom of course laughed at me. Well before the first season was even over I purchased the bluray box set for her for X-Mas. We finished watching the entire series + movie and bonus features over the holiday season. Well you can imagnine reading news about its BIG 2016 return shortly after finishing it to just be icing on the cake for us, also very odd for a show to be gone that long to return too. So yeah this recent awful news has just been devastating. I cannot imagine how it is for those that completed watching it while it was on the air 25 years ago.

twinpeaks,31yvbb,Jazz_Cub,12,Thu Apr 9 05:48:53 2015 UTC,"This is a really nice thought/gesture but you can't just raise 10M and give it to David Lynch so he directs Twin Peaks again.   You have to imagine all the other factors. The contractual rights to the scripts, individual contracts not just with actors but people across the board. Distribution... the list goes on.   It's nice that you want to throw 10M at this but believe me Showtime has 10M. There is no shortage of people in Hollywood and richer than us late night reddit browsers who want to see this happen.   I'm sure there is a money aspect to this (because Mr. Lynch has said as much) but he's also talked in the past about how ever since Dune in '84 he will never let a studio dictate how he runs his productions again.  There is more to this story and your 10M isn't going to bring it back.  Showtime giving him complete creative rights and in that same vein control over the budget as he sees fit will bring him back."

twinpeaks,31xh3o,redloveone,9,Wed Apr 8 22:38:01 2015 UTC,"Picture this. In the process of shooting the pilot, Lynch saw something in Frank Silva. The entire story was changed based on this to incorporate a new character named Bob. Bob became the driving antagonistic force for the entire series.  When the series was on the verge of its final episode, Lynch stepped in, took one look at the script he hadn't written and went about transforming it into one of the most memorable episodes of a series that the TV medium has known.    It's easy to reduce a director down to a ""visual style of shooting"" as though they were simply sprinkling spice on an already-prepared dish, but I don't see this as the case. A director who simply brings to life what's on the page is a good director, by textbook definition. Lynch, however, transforms throughout the process. The writing is an iteration, the shooting is an iteration, and so on. The final piece is continuously refined through each step to take it from a solid groundwork into a complete experience. The scripts are one thing, the end result that we see can be entirely different. Many cite strong scenes and episodes within Twin Peaks as evidence that Lynch is unnecessary, yet hesitate to ask or imagine what those scenes would have been with Lynch behind the camera. The Lonely Souls episode, that cracked the case for us all, would not have been half of what it was with anyone else behind the camera."

twinpeaks,31o7cj,FloydPink24,9,Mon Apr 6 21:53:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, neither is good.  I'd rather see a bad homage to Lynch's style than something generic if I really had to pick between those terrible options.  At least it would be more interesting.  My fingers are crossed that it's not too late to work out the issue.  Maybe if the cast members continue to speak out on this that will apply the right pressure on Showtime.  Who knows if Showtime is the unreasonable party here, though."
twinpeaks,31o7cj,foryourhealth80,18,Mon Apr 6 22:02:07 2015 UTC,"We're already at a point of no return, something, even vague details had to be written by now as to where the story will go. This only ends in a doc a couple of decades from now where cast, crew and fans wring their hands about what ""could have been"".   The Jodorowsky's Dune scenario aside, my interest in the project waxes and wanes with Lynch's involvement. Eager anticipation if the original plan somehow still goes through, dissipating interest with each step back. With no Lynch on the project, there wouldn't even be a point. Nothing against Frost, but the show is Lynch's brainchild, it's already difficult not to consider plot elements from episodes he wasn't on skeptically in regards to being canon.   If Lynch isn't involved, call the whole thing off as far as I'm concerned. This needs to be done right or not at all. If Lynch writes and directs, regardless of my opinion of the episodes, at the very least they'll be the proper conclusion. This is one of the most distinct voices in film and television, without him, it's a fun fan fiction project that I won't be anticipating."
twinpeaks,31o7cj,Cardow,4,Tue Apr 7 00:54:12 2015 UTC,A huge thing with the way Lynch's work occurs is through random chance and serendipity. He knows when to go with it. It is a major contributing factor to his style and thus the style of Twin Peaks.
twinpeaks,31o7cj,redux42,2,Tue Apr 7 17:15:18 2015 UTC,"I could not agree more. People tend to have a lot of suspicions about the potential quality of a remake, revival, or other continuation of something successful long down the road, and I tend to agree. The only reason I didn't feel that way at all about this was because Lynch was on to direct and write every episode. The episodes he directed/wrote were easily the best of the series, and his vision is largely responsible for the quality of the show.  Without him on, it's literally a complete 180 for me. It goes from being a proper revival and conclusion to the story to something that will be detrimental to my opinion of the show. It's just incredibly sad how my opinion of this thing has changed, and it will be insanely disappointing if they go on without him."
twinpeaks,31o7cj,Flamgirlant,14,Wed Apr 8 04:34:32 2015 UTC,Without Lynch its completely pointless and I would most likely skip anything that was produced.

twinpeaks,31o7cj,RicDan,2,Tue Apr 7 12:58:19 2015 UTC,"Anderson is a class act. He is perfect in TP and Mulholland Drive. He also was fantastic in a similarly surreal sense in Carnivale. He's just a powerful actor that absolutely owns any role he plays.  Most importantly, in this scenario, he's 100% right, and more people need to be as honest as he is here. Good on him for not beating around the bush, and just being straight to the point. Yes, a TP remake without Lynch is absurd. Fuck any compromise with other directors. It took 25 years because the right circumstances needed to arise, and it will only work if everything is perfect. Lynch's role in directing is literally the most important thing by a long shot."

twinpeaks,31o7cj,JohnEbin,0,Tue Apr 7 07:53:52 2015 UTC,"Of the 29 episodes he only directed 6.   He wrote all the scripts to the new season already. So that's done, he's just not directing.  Granted the episodes he directed were the best ones, just because he's not directing the new ones doesn't mean they will be bad"
twinpeaks,31o7cj,JohnLocke815,19,Tue Apr 7 03:49:42 2015 UTC,"Everyone please stop posting this,television shows are made much differently than movies. Though he only directed a few (some of the best ones by the way) he was an EP for every episode and was involved on every episode in more ways than you can read on imdb. An EP has way more creative control than any tv director. Vince Gilligan only directed a few episodes of breaking bad but the show followed his vision because he was EP.  Tl;Dr Creative control in movies = Directors Creative control in TV = Executive Producers"
twinpeaks,31o7cj,girlafraidx,5,Tue Apr 7 05:07:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you. Like yes, we all know he didn't direct every single episode. But still, even if he would have, the second season probably wouldn't have veered off in all the directions that it did and would've been better-not saying I still don't enjoy that season but his directing is such a crucial aspect of this show. If it's going to come back, it needs to be done right or not at all imo."
twinpeaks,31o7cj,The-Doctor-94,2,Tue Apr 7 08:14:23 2015 UTC,"This. A television Director is more akin to a Director of Photography for films. They run the actual shoot, but don't get much creative input, other than with some of the camera work."
twinpeaks,31o7cj,Flamgirlant,1 point,Tue Apr 7 12:07:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%. And just my own personal opinion, the episodes he directed were largely responsible for the show's mood, themes, surrealism, atmosphere, basically just everything that made the show great. A lot of that carried over to other episodes, but it's the ones he's behind that really stick in my mind even while I'm watching episodes that he didn't have such a strong role in.  I think anyone familiar with Lynch's work can realize that the show's direction was almost entirely based on Lynch's ideas. It makes me really sad to think about it carrying on without him in a crucial role."
twinpeaks,31o7cj,LostInTheMovies,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:39:39 2015 UTC,"While this is generally true, Lynch doesn't seem to have used his executive producer role to operate as a showrunner for much of Twin Peaks.  Certainly, his involvement with the second half of the series was minimal. He supposedly worked with Frost to outline the arc of season one, but I'm not sure how much he had to do with the stories of even the early part of season two (certainly we know he wasn't a big fan of revealing the killer, which was what those episodes were leading up to). He also was not physically present for most of season one because he was shooting Wild at Heart (NOT during the second season as many people - including Lynch himself! - erroneously claim). From most accounts, it seems like Frost was really the day-to-day showrunner and that Lynch's involvement ebbed and flowed based on when he was actually directing an episode.  Perhaps because he was coming from the world of cinema then, his approach to executive-producing does seem to have been a bit more akin to the film world than the TV one. I don't think the in-between idea of orchestrating the whole conception but not actually being the one physically directing the camera and actors does really clicks with him (whereas Frost came up in TV and was more suited to the overseer/showrunner role). He had creative control, yes, but he seems to have exercised it only fleetingly when he directing an episode.  What is clear, though, is that when Lynch DID direct an episode he produced the best material in the series. He also stepped beyond the director's usual role by rewriting scripts without credit (and sometimes his ""rewrites"" were not even committed to paper but seemingly improvised on set - see the final episode).  And that's why he really needs to be back in the director's chair for the Showtime series. If he is just executive producer for 2016 he will almost certainly be hands-off."
twinpeaks,31o7cj,ExplosionsintheEye,0,Wed Apr 8 08:28:59 2015 UTC,"Understood, but when he says he will not be directing any episodes, he means he will not be involved as an executive producer as well, correct?"
twinpeaks,31o7cj,former-teacher,0,Tue Apr 7 12:38:02 2015 UTC,So Lynch is just as much to blame as anyone for the way season 2 turned out?
twinpeaks,31o7cj,girlafraidx,2,Tue Apr 7 13:03:18 2015 UTC,He was largely absent for most of season two. He was filming another movie and they were losing more and more creative control over the show.
twinpeaks,31o7cj,LostInTheMovies,2,Tue Apr 7 15:35:00 2015 UTC,"It's true he was largely absent, but Wild at Heart was actually filmed in 1989, simultaneously with the first season. By the time work on the second season began (in the summer of 1990) Wild at Heart was already complete, and had in fact won the Palme d'Or at Cannes back in May. So Lynch stepped back from the show for other reasons, probably because he was disillusioned with ending Laura's mystery."

twinpeaks,31oh47,trashbagman,11,Mon Apr 6 23:21:06 2015 UTC,"Showtime has made some impressive shows, but they don't have the reputation of HBO or even Netflix. They want to be seen as another HBO, and this is going to do more and more to damage to their reputation with both viewers and talent. Assuming Lynch isn't being unreasonable (and even if he is), they should push hard to resolve this properly."
twinpeaks,31oh47,Debageldond,3,Tue Apr 7 04:10:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah besides Dexter I can't think of a single show that warranted a real interest in Showtime's original programming (and even that ended like shit). I think HBO more than almost any other network has a dedication to making sure their content is not only popular but also reputable, which is what really brings in viewers in the long term more than just a flavor of the week show. This was a big opportunity for Showtime. If they don't get Lynch on board, this will just be one more mediocre show to add to their arsenal. But if Lynch really does direct it, it's a legitimately artful creation of their own that is worth looking into. And especially considering Game of Thrones' popularity, I think that they should recognize how important that is, even if they don't.  I honestly don't think they will cave, and I think we will just get that mediocre product, which makes me sad. But I think showtime is consistently second to HBO for good reason."

But my point still stands - in the era of Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Go, the general public is getting more and more rabid for quality, serial TV shows. Just look at the vocal response even just on reddit to HBO's Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire and True Detective. That's among many others. Even IRL, you're bound to run into tons of people who want to talk about just those shows. How many people talk about the fact that HBO is airing Grandma's Boy, Cheaper By The Dozen 2, and Home Alone 3 right now? Don't get me wrong, their movie access is actually pretty great - they're also airing some truly quality stuff right now. But I think that original programming is what sets the premium networks apart, and what makes HBO the really big name among them right now."

twinpeaks,31oh47,treetraffick,2,Tue Apr 7 12:09:54 2015 UTC,"The problem is that Showtime won't allocate the money to make the show the way Lynch thinks it should be made - but there's no crazy budget in this show, no CGI, not even any super expensive actors, so what exactly is it that David Lynch is willing to fight for?  Film. As in, actual film, not digital production. David Lynch has said about the Twin Peaks boxed set that working on it had rekindled his love for film. That's the entire reason Twin Peaks was being remade in the first place. Conversely, after his experience making Inland Empire with digital film, he straight up quit making movies. Film is the only thing expensive enough that I can see Showtime pushing back against because they see it as unnecessary. And they've probably long since scrapped any actual film production equipment, so it would cost more than you'd think to convert production back to a 100% film workflow."
twinpeaks,31oh47,Sentry_the_Defiant,1 point,Wed Apr 8 08:20:13 2015 UTC,It's possible they are determined to do the show with or without Lynch. In that case I think our next best hope is that a benevolent third party(s) decides to fund the show with their own money.

I don't have the same optimism that you do that showtime will cave, but god damn do I hope you are right."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,coffee_guy,10,Wed Apr 8 04:52:22 2015 UTC,Always surprised that he gets anything done.  Look at how long it took to make Eraserhead.
twinpeaks,31lwk2,GaijinSama,14,Mon Apr 6 15:34:59 2015 UTC,"But then look how quickly he's gotten everything else done. Eraserhead took so long because it was a student film, one he wasn't being paid for and was primarily financing himself, as well as fabricating most of the props/sets/design. So yeah, it took him 5 years because he was working on it in bits and pieces when he had time and money to pour into it and everyone was able to get together at once. Every other project he's done, and been paid for, has come about fairly quickly."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,ChuckEye,5,Mon Apr 6 16:51:48 2015 UTC,But then look how quickly he's gotten everything else done.   He took two and a half years to shoot Inland Empire…
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Bat-Might,10,Mon Apr 6 17:40:17 2015 UTC,"Well that project was always intended to be a little fun thing he improvised with his friends then cut together into a narrative, there was no reason to rush it."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,GaijinSama,5,Mon Apr 6 18:27:27 2015 UTC,"That's a bit misleading, because Inland Empire was pieced together from short films he had directed for his website. He then formed a narrative tissue around previously filmed projects. That would be like saying Stephen King took 20 years to put together his short story collection Full Dark, No Stars, because some of those stories were written a couple decades ago."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,linktm,11,Mon Apr 6 19:38:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is kind of my thoughts on this. Everyone is so quick to blame Showtime, but considering how quiet Lynch has been about everything up until voicing his doubts, maybe he's just being a diva?"
twinpeaks,31lwk2,GaijinSama,18,Mon Apr 6 14:06:45 2015 UTC,"Backing out of Twin Peaks is pretty much in line with his recent artistic endeavors. Lynch was pretty outspoken about how he disliked working in television only because so many people who weren't artists had control over the final product. Look at what he's been doing over the past ten years; a string of short films produced for his website, weather reports, selling coffee, working on some albums, and a film that was largely self financed and distributed independently. I don't think Lynch is being a diva, but I think he gets fed up with having to deal with the corporate side of studio work."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,milligna,4,Mon Apr 6 16:55:02 2015 UTC,"If anybody earned the right to be a ""diva,"" it's David fucking Lynch when it comes to bringing back Twin Peaks. Don't be a fool siding with some interchangeable TV execs who will be forgotten and out of jobs in six months over a one of a kind talent."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,tronbrain,2,Tue Apr 7 04:34:21 2015 UTC,"Lynch not long ago stated he has fallen in love again with film. I believe he mentioned that he wanted to shoot these new episodes on film. Shooting on film will cost a bundle of extra money as opposed to using digital. Frankly, I see no good reason to use film anymore. That's one place I think Lynch should compromise and try to save the studio some budget."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,IAmASoundEngineer,5,Mon Apr 6 19:18:26 2015 UTC,Also he apparently wants a big cut in the DVD/blu-ray  sales which is something I personally think he could compromise as well.
twinpeaks,31lwk2,paperfisherman,3,Mon Apr 6 22:22:32 2015 UTC,"Generally -- yes, there aren't many reasons to use film over digital when it comes to value, cost, ease, etc.  That being said, film really does look better.  For a great case study, watch episodes of ""Breaking Bad"", then episodes of ""Better Call Saul.""  Same crew, directors, many of the actors, etc.  But Breaking Bad was shot in 35mm film, and it has that film grain and quality which gives it far more depth and richness than Better Call Saul, which was shot digitally."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,tronbrain,4,Mon Apr 6 23:51:05 2015 UTC,"I would have agreed with you maybe just two years ago. But I have seen some incredible work coming out of digital these last couple of years. I really think digital has turned the corner. And with digital grading technology, they can equal any kind of film look. For my eyes, there is no reason not to use digital. And I say this as a huge DL/TP fan, and as someone who appreciates good cinematography.  I think the disparities you mention between Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul can be attributed to the cinematographers and production crew. Perhaps they simply prefer a cleaner, less grainy look for the new series. I suspect that the final seasons of Breaking Bad were shot on digital, but I am not in a position to say."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,paperfisherman,3,Tue Apr 7 00:08:35 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, digital has made amazing advancements in the past few years, and for the grand majority Of projects, it's a no-brainier over film.  My point with the BB/Saul comparison is that they are shot with the same cinematographers, directors, and production crews, so the fact that the final product feels cleaner and flatter can probably be attributed mostly to the switch from 35mm to digital.  I'm also pretty sure BB was shot on film to the very end.  Another good example is the Game of Thrones pilot.  Portions filmed by Tom McCarthy in 2009 were shot on film, and the scenes that survive in the aired pilot are clearly more cinematic-looking."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,tronbrain,2,Tue Apr 7 00:17:15 2015 UTC,"You may well be right. I haven't made such close comparisons as you mention here.  I do know that Nicolas Winding Refn shot his recent films - Drive, Only God Forgives - on Red cinema cameras. And his stuff just looks gorgeous. I don't think the decision to shoot digital has caused him to compromise at all. Maybe there is a loss even still. But I would need to make the study of it that you have before I can pinpoint just what it might be."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,milligna,0,Tue Apr 7 00:19:56 2015 UTC,"Nah. Film destroys digital still. I've worked with both plenty, but you're simply wrong. Maybe in another 10 years."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,tronbrain,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:33:16 2015 UTC,"Destroys, eh?  Digital grading makes up for any of the remaining deficiencies of shooting digital. I might have agreed with you a few years ago. No longer."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,FloydPink24,2,Tue Apr 7 19:24:11 2015 UTC,"This was originally the case I think, but in a recent fan Q&A he said it would be shot on digital."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,tronbrain,1 point,Tue Apr 7 10:34:22 2015 UTC,Nice to know that David Lynch and I are in agreement.
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Flamgirlant,2,Tue Apr 7 19:18:22 2015 UTC,"Lynch shot Inland Empire in 2006 or so on a sony camera that only stored SD digital video if I'm not mistaken, and he said he loved the look that it gave the film. That's actually one of the few creative choices of Lynch that I 100% disagree with, but I find it hard to believe that he would really walk away from this just because they wanted to use digital vs film. But I don't actually know - I guess his use of that camera in some ways points to the fact that he considers his own view of what should be used to shoot something very important."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,tronbrain,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:59:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's correct. Inland Empire was filmed on SD video.  Lynch is at least open-minded enough to look at new technology that might make it easier and/or less expensive for him to produce his film projects. His problem has been essentially two-fold - money, and creative control. If he finds ways to diminish the need for the former, i.e. by shooting on digital video, the issue of creative control is essentially solved.  I think the results of Inland Empire are somewhat mixed. The Rabbits segments looked good to me, but otherwise I was unimpressed with the look of the digital video, especially in low light. The resolution was too low; it was too crude. But that was nearly ten years ago. With today's digital video technology, the limitations Lynch experienced on Inland Empire are a thing of the past. Today's DV cameras are simply incredible, and it is less expensive than ever to achieve film-grade quality and resolution using digital cameras."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,milligna,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:29:45 2015 UTC,No good reason!?!?  So it looks BEAUTIFUL.  So it looks TIMELESS.  So it matches the other seasons.  Fool.
twinpeaks,31lwk2,tronbrain,2,Tue Apr 7 04:32:51 2015 UTC,"Have you seen results from the latest digital camera technology? It is INCREDIBLE what these new cameras can do. You can achieve any kind of look, including an excellent emulation of whatever film stock you like. Have you seen any of Nicolas Winding Refn's recent films? I defy you to tell me that he lost any of these qualities you mention because he shot on digital.  In my opinion, digital has turned the corner, and there is no longer any appreciable benefit to shooting with film. Just an opinion."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,tronbrain,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:14:26 2015 UTC,"As another poster has stated here, Lynch had already agreed to shoot the new series on digital.  So who is the fool now?"
twinpeaks,31lwk2,kbergstr,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:25:01 2015 UTC,"I agree-- it seems like he's trying to wage the war of popular opinion to get what he wants. If the product is near perfect, that's great, but if he's just running around showtimes back right to the fans anytime things don't go his way, I'd be a bit disappointed."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Baba_Ganoush_Big_Guy,11,Mon Apr 6 20:33:21 2015 UTC,"Every Twin Peaks fan knows that Lynch directed episodes literally FEEL different. He has a way of directing that perfectly walks the line between comic absurdity with outlandish characters and capturing the dark underbelly of American life. His editing and his influence and his moodiness and use of sound, his episodes are just different. They feel like twin peaks. The first season was meticulously written and supervised by David and Mark, each episode was manicured to fit that feeling. The second season fell apart when CBS fucked them and they stopped caring and being involved. Twin Peaks with only Lynch Frost scripts will not have that feel we've all been salivating over. The lynch directed aspect was shocking and a big, big reason we were so excited over the announcement. In fact, honestly, it was so out of the blue and unexpected that I cried at my college that day, in the middle of the university center. I don't think I would have cried without thinking that I'd get Lynch's first real directed film since Mulholland Drive."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Flamgirlant,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:57:44 2015 UTC,"I 100% agree about his episodes feeling different. I've posted this elsewhere, but I think the episodes he directed not only were fantastic on their own, but they contributed a lot to the other episodes that weren't directed by him, because they really injected that permeating feeling of the dark, surreal nature of TP. Even if an episode didn't capture that feeling or dive into the same darkness or surrealness, his episodes still sat in the back of your mind and gave you a greater understanding of Twin Peaks. The mood and atmosphere of the town/environment - which are the things the show captured better than any other show ever, owe themselves largely to the episodes he directed."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,citizenpuppet,10,Wed Apr 8 05:05:13 2015 UTC,"This will all end up working out. They can't go on without David Lynch. They'll get him his money, or someone else will."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,bass_n_treble,11,Mon Apr 6 15:12:52 2015 UTC,Netflix should pick it up.  Give the man a blank check.
twinpeaks,31lwk2,GaijinSama,16,Mon Apr 6 15:22:23 2015 UTC,But Showtime still owns the show. Showtime wants to make the show. Showtime has nine scripts already completed. There would be no reason for them to give it to someone else.
twinpeaks,31lwk2,GaijinSama,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:52:30 2015 UTC,"they will not make money on this show if they cant afford lynch. it will not be a success. the majority of twin peaks fan dont even want to watch a lynchless twin peaks. i dont think theres any way theyll make it without him at this point. it would just be moronic. the reason they brought it back is because theres a large audience willing to pay for it. losing lynch will do nothing but alienate and anger that audience, and the project will flop. so who knows? maybe if they cant pay for lynch theyll just sell the scripts to another studio? better to make some money off it than lose tons making something nobody wanted anyways."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Voduar,2,Tue Apr 7 07:41:20 2015 UTC,"I think there's very little chance the Twin Peaks fandom won't watch the new series, with or without Lynch. They may be upset, they may not like it, but everyone is going to watch it one way or another just out of completism or curiosity. At this point, the only people that have a  real chance of getting Lynch back on board are the actors(and Mark Frost). If the actors start backing out due to Lynch's absence, then Showtime's back will really be against the wall."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Voduar,13,Tue Apr 7 14:09:59 2015 UTC,"They desperately need him around the set, though. Every TP failure(that wasn't James) stems from attempting to use Lynchian characters without Lynch there to intervene."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,GaijinSama,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:54:38 2015 UTC,"I hope but Gordon could easily not be in this season. Hell, Dale doesn't need to eb FBI anymore."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Argobast,7,Mon Apr 6 18:29:45 2015 UTC,"Well, he directed 6, but they were the 6 most important episodes of the series. The pilot, the one with Coop's dream, the reveal of the killer, the finale, and the first two episodes of the second season.  That isn't to say other directors didn't do good work. Tim Hunter did some great episodes, for example. But Lynch is the defining voice of Twin Peaks' visual style, and along with Mark Frost the defining voice of the show's writing. Now, he's already written the scripts, but without Lynch there on set to help steer the show, the chances of us getting more stories like that shitty one where James enters a z-grade film noir increases."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Flamgirlant,2,Mon Apr 6 19:39:41 2015 UTC,"But the scripts are already written and in Showtime's hands, so I doubt they'd try to shoehorn weird new plots in just because Lynch is out."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Argobast,1 point,Mon Apr 6 19:46:21 2015 UTC,"Yes but TP is, at least for me, as much about the atmosphere and mood as it is the plots. Badalamenti's ST plays a huge role in that, but the episodes directed by Lynch just had his signature surreal, dream-like vibe that defined the show on a much greater level than anyone else who directed an episode could capture. It's great that he wrote all the episodes, but him directing them really would've made them absolute perfection as far as I'm concerned. He has the most unique vision of any modern director that I'm aware of, and it's what defined this show."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Flamgirlant,2,Mon Apr 6 19:35:58 2015 UTC,"Oh, no argument from me. I didn't mean the show would be fine or even worth making without Lynch. Only that I doubted Showtime would add in a ""James enjoys an extended motorcycle trip"" or ""The Log Lady misplaces her log and hijinks ensue"" storyline just because he dropped out. -Unless the whole problem is over the scripts themselves, which nothing that I've read has indicated."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Bat-Might,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:47:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, thanks for the clarification. I wrongly assumed that you were implying that the show would work without Lynch because they would avoid shows like James on his trip, Nadine and her drapes/HS power, etc. My mistake."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,Bat-Might,6,Wed Apr 8 05:10:33 2015 UTC,"The show could exist without him, sure, but it would undoubtedly be a lesser final product. He's a one of a kind creative genius."
twinpeaks,31lwk2,girlafraidx,6,Wed Apr 8 06:42:03 2015 UTC,"If you're still excited by the idea of new episodes written but not directed by him then by all means, be excited. I really love his style of camera-work, effects, editing, and so on though so the news is harder for me to take."

twinpeaks,31rhmg,themx,4,Tue Apr 7 16:58:45 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: Lynch's writing alone isn't what makes this. For example, BOB started out as an accidental shot of someone that Lynch ran with. While he doesn't necessarily need to direct every episode I really think they need David on set because one of his greatest skills is adaptation on the fly."

Mulholland Dr. is widely considered one of the best, if not the best, films of the last 15 years. This is that awkward moment when someone pointing the finger of ""pretentious"" turns pretentious themselves while trying to be contrarian. Attacking Lynch, and his recent output, is a poor substitute for an opinion.   This incident with Lynch walking has brought a lot of opinions out of the woodwork - it's funny how many Twin Peaks fans are not fans of Lynch in general and want to disassociate him with their beloved show. Sorry to say, folks, he's the reason for the season, and season 3 would be better off not happening than to proceed without the artist who breathed life into what could have been another dead-end TV show. If giving Mulholland Dr. shit is the best argument for why the show is better off without its driving force, consider me not convinced."

twinpeaks,31ke1x,chekhovscricketbat,7,Sun Apr 5 23:08:19 2015 UTC,"The way he worded it certainly seems like he meant Showtime wouldn't give them the budget they need to realize his vision, I don't think it's a greed thing.

There's something so weird about all of this, and I can't help but think that maybe deep down it's more about the fact that Lynch just really doesn't have the desire to direct. He's already co-written all of the episodes. If it were really about creative differences, wouldn't he just put an end to the entire thing? I'm super bummed about this, but I don't think we're getting the full picture."

If this is due to contract problems, then why did Lynch AND Frost AND Showtime all seem just fine about going forward with announcing the series? Did none of them (or their legal representation) say ""hey, maybe we should make sure we have all the contracts locked in before we talk about this like it's a done deal?"""
twinpeaks,31jvz7,Binary101010,10,Sun Apr 5 21:17:06 2015 UTC,"A few weeks ago, this article from Entertainment Weekly strongly indicated that sources at Showtime were pushing back on Lynch's comments.  Which makes things even odder.  The Twin Peaks revival page is still up at Showtime and accessible from the front page.

Dear Twitter Friends, Showtime did not pull the plug on Twin Peaks.  After 1 year and 4 months of negotiations, I left because not enough money was offered to do the script the way I felt it needed to be done.

twinpeaks,31jvz7,InerasableStain,3,Mon Apr 6 02:30:04 2015 UTC,"Try six episodes of Season 1 and seventeen (I think?) of Season 2.  Lynch only directed six episodes of the whole series. For the rest of the time, he wasn't even in the capacity of showrunner. In the first season he was directing Wild At Heart, and in the second he was doing art installations in Japan.  No one is talking about Mark Frost. Frost pretty much filled in the spot that everyone thinks Lynch had for the majority of original run. And as far as we know, he's still on board! It sucks that Lynch dropped out, but this can still work. Lynch is not the only good director out there."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,Binary101010,2,Mon Apr 6 11:19:09 2015 UTC,It seems like all of these articles are coming back around to Kimmy Robertson's FB page as the main source.
twinpeaks,31jvz7,Eiyran,4,Sun Apr 5 23:19:29 2015 UTC,"What it seems like to me is that everybody signed contracts, and David Lynch at some point after figures were agreed upon decided that he wanted more money (for himself or the show, there's no way to know) and figures that Showtime will give it to him if he threatens to pull out of the project.   That's the only scenario that makes any sense here. No way everybody makes all these official announcements without contracts in place. Probably Lynch's contract requires him to write but not direct (which is why sources are still saying he's going to be involved in writing but that he won't be directing), and he's intentionally making it sound like he'll be completely uninvolved with the project to get people riled up so that Showtime gets scared and offers him more money."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,cheyenne04,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:44:33 2015 UTC,"Very odd indeed. Lynch could easily fund this as a feature film independently or take it to netflix, but the question is whether he really wants to do it."

If scripts are already written (as rumored) and Lynch, Frost and the actors are still interested, it seems like it could still happen.  At the very least, hopefully we will still be getting Mark Frost's book."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,FloydPink24,25,Sun Apr 5 20:31:16 2015 UTC,Surely Netflix would pay through the roof to get their hands on this.
twinpeaks,31jvz7,Scapone22,-16,Sun Apr 5 21:43:25 2015 UTC,"Why? It was exactly a ratings hit.  It has a loyal cult following but that hardly warrants throwing money at the project.  We're biased because we're huge fans but really this is a risk, very far from a sure thing.  It wouldn't be smart to just throw money at it to get it."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,chekhovscricketbat,15,Sun Apr 5 22:48:01 2015 UTC,"Typo I think—but Twin Peaks WAS a ratings hit and cultural sensation. Much more popular than for example The X-Files, which is being revived to run on broadcast tv.  Netflix wants to be a big player and getting bigger. Their pockets are probably as deep as Showtime's or deeper."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,redyellowand,6,Sun Apr 5 22:51:24 2015 UTC,"And just like X Files, the fanbase has grown through because it's on Netflix. I was born in 91 so I definitely wasn't there for the first go-around."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,Flamgirlant,2,Sun Apr 5 23:02:59 2015 UTC,"It not only was a cultural sensation, but it almost single-handedly defined the current era of TV shows that warrant discussion among fans outside of the show. And I think Netflix is at least 90% responsible for its resurgence in popularity/interest. I don't think that it will happen, but there's certainly enough reason for it."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,Scapone22,0,Wed Apr 8 05:27:04 2015 UTC,"It was indeed incredibly popular when it debuted but it quickly dropped in viewership and it has been virtually irrelevant for almost 20 years.  The x files doesn't really have to be revived, it ran for 9 years and had 2 movies, one years after the series ended.  It's also 6 episodes on network TV.  Very, very low risk.  Twin Peaks is far from a sure thing to bring back for an elaborate new series, especially with how serialized it is.  It's a much bigger risk than x files.  Partially proved by just how difficult it is to get it going again, if it was such a shoe in, it would already be a done deal."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,chekhovscricketbat,2,Mon Apr 6 00:07:46 2015 UTC,"What we don't know is how much money we're talking about here. We know Netflix can buy everything from cult show revivals, to revivals of shows hardly anyone cared about, new series that other networks would consider a risk, or even develop their own MASSIVELY expensive series as an admitted gamble.  In other words, Twin Peaks is clearly less risky than other things Netflix bought, but is Lynch asking for some inordinate amount of money? Maybe."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,alsoye,-1,Mon Apr 6 00:15:43 2015 UTC,Twin Peaks was never more popular than X-Files. At any point.
twinpeaks,31jvz7,chekhovscricketbat,2,Mon Apr 6 20:54:03 2015 UTC,"Luckily a measurement exists to answer this exact question! Twin Peaks' second episode (the first one-hour episode) drew a 16.2 Nielsen rating, down from the pilot. Ratings would decline later on, though it's hard to find exact numbers this old. You can see the Nielsen rating for every X-Files episode here. Exactly one episode of that much-longer series had a higher rating than Twin Peaks' second."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,Binary101010,4,Tue Apr 7 00:34:25 2015 UTC,"The pilot was the highest rated two-hour movie of the season across all networks, back at a time when those were important ratings-grabbers. The show had pretty good ratings for its time even given that ABC moved it around a lot on the schedule, at least up until the murder was solved.  Netflix has already invested in bringing back a franchise (Arrested Development) with ratings that weren't nearly as good as Twin Peaks' ratings were at its apex, so it's reasonable to look at them as a candidate. Of course, they'd be wanting to make sure they get their money's worth."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,mattl,2,Sun Apr 5 22:54:44 2015 UTC,Netflix also brought back Trailer Park Boys.
twinpeaks,31jvz7,Scapone22,1 point,Sun Apr 5 23:34:41 2015 UTC,"Right, but AD is way more recent and had more than tripled in popularity from when it got cancelled.  Defintely a bigger risk for netflix than x files is for fox but I still think Twin Peaks is a very risky revival.  And I'm a big fan who wants it back more than I ever wanted AD or x files."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,FloydPink24,4,Mon Apr 6 00:25:12 2015 UTC,I think Peaks could be pretty huge among the new teen binge-watching demographic. They love stuff like this.
twinpeaks,31jvz7,Scapone22,0,Sun Apr 5 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"I think it could but would be a risk I know more people who have never heard of it than I have who even have heard of it let alone watch it.  I'm a fan, I want it back, but it seems like a risk and that's backed up by how difficult it is to get back on the air."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,duellingislands,3,Mon Apr 6 00:43:42 2015 UTC,"What are you smoking?  Not only was the initial run a worldwide phenomenon for a time, but every hip 20-something I know not only has seen Twin Peaks but loves it and references it every chance they get.  Even the generation older than me remembers the buzz and ""who shot JR""-ness of it all.  Even without Lynch (which would be MAJORLY shitty), Twin Peaks Redux would likely be a huge score for whoever brings it to market."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,Scapone22,0,Mon Apr 6 00:51:50 2015 UTC,"I could ask you the same question.  I'm 27 and I don't know a single person (in real life) who has ever heard of the show outside of me telling them about it.  The most common reaction I get is ""I think I've heard of that, is it like LOST?"".  There are no reruns easily available.  The original run started successful but trailed off and was done in under 40 episodes.    It's hardly a sure thing.  In the last few weeks netflix has announced full house and fox the x files.  nbc announced coach.  Plus 24 already came back with a limited season run.  All of these things had people I know talking and yet I was the only person I knew excited about Twin Peaks.  It has a very loyal cult following but given the talent involved and complexity of the serialized story, bringing it back can end up being an expensive failure.  It's much higher risk than 6 or even 13 episodes of the x files that can do monster of the week mixed with mythology not necessary to enjoy it, or a sitcom spinoff.  Sensitive material, potentially expensive talent, an ever aging fan base.  Someone who is 30 now wasn't even 10 when the show first aired, making it likely they never knew about it.  It's getting past the key demo.  Again, I want it.  I want it more than any of the other revivals that have been done or announced.  I think it makes sense, story wise.  I think it absolutely CAN be successful.  I also think it is a really big risk for the reasons listed in this post."

twinpeaks,31jvz7,Debageldond,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:06:39 2015 UTC,"I just can't conceive how he would be comfortable letting one of his projects, possibly his most beloved, left to fend for itself in whoever's hands it ends up. I really do not get it."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,Flamgirlant,2,Mon Apr 6 03:18:49 2015 UTC,"I think it has something to do with David Lynch being a huge fucking weirdo. A magnificent one, to be sure, but a weirdo nonetheless."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,nynedragons,1 point,Mon Apr 6 07:34:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He has spoken with great affection about TP throughout the years. This is a huge fucking deal to bring it back. I initially felt like TP would have never come back if the conditions weren't 100% locked in and optimal for Lynch. It just seems insane to me that he would do this half-way, writing scrips for it and then selling it without the assurance that he would have complete creative control over it. The idea that he really is just willing to walk away from this and let other people direct his vision for a TP revival just seems to go against my thoughts/beliefs of the guy, and I am a huge Lynch fan. I mean isn't this exactly the kind of thing that caused season 2's failures? Why wasn't he better prepared for that?"
twinpeaks,31jvz7,dragonstoner,1 point,Wed Apr 8 05:39:22 2015 UTC,Only thing I can figure is he's being hard on show time in the hopes that they will concede on the budget or he has some ulterior artistic motive

twinpeaks,31jvz7,Flamgirlant,5,Mon Apr 6 04:05:11 2015 UTC,"This is going to be unpopular, but I don't care: it can still work without Lynch.  He already handed his scripts over to Showtime. Even if he's no longer in the director's chair, there are plenty of great talents that could take over for him. What about Cary Fukanaga or any of the Fargo directors? Imagine what they could bring to the table. And Mark Frost is still on board (as far as we know), which is a good sign.  People are acting like Lynch was 100% responsible for the show's success. He was great when he was there, but he only directed six episodes, even in the best portions of the show. In Season 1, he left to direct Wild At Heart, and in Season 2 he was apparently working on art shows in Japan.  IMO, it can still work. Showtime either needs to try and appease him or just play hardball and bring new talent aboard. It would be foolish to quit this late in the game, after so much of the cast and story has been re-assembled. David Lynch isn't the only good director out there, and much as I love him, the show can live on without his name attached."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,orgodefacto,2,Mon Apr 6 01:59:48 2015 UTC,"Don't be an idiot. Lynch is 50% of Twin Peaks, you don't want watered down coffee."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,orgodefacto,1 point,Tue Apr 7 18:58:42 2015 UTC,"Lynch just has such a unique style as a director. I wouldn't say the show couldn't work without his direction, but his direction really did seal the deal that this would be a fantastic revival. I can't shake the feeling that with him it will be on par with season 1 in its prime, and without him it will be season 2 at its lowest. Lynch wasn't 100% responsible for the show's success, of course, but I do think he was responsible for an incredibly large portion of it. I think anyone who knows Lynch's work will know that TP seems to have succeeded almost entirely because of his unique vision.   I guess I sort of feel like, if they're going to revive this show 25 years later, they need to either do it perfectly or not do it at all."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,HeWhoHatesTheSnow,1 point,Wed Apr 8 05:44:50 2015 UTC,"If the creative differences between Lynch and the network were so severe that he had to drop out (budget or other), I don't see why they should be given the benefit of the doubt that they'll do the material justice."
twinpeaks,31jvz7,orgodefacto,3,Mon Apr 6 02:37:36 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it's a paycheck issue. I really am.  A few months (weeks?

If the man wants 10 million dollars in his budget to have plastic pink flamingos placed all over the country-side just because he felt like it that's what you do.

This wasn't some cashgrab remake or reboot, this would have been a 9 episode story arc picking up all of the loose threads of the original. I never wanted a sequel either, until I saw that teaser and realized it was somehow the thing I wanted most in the world.  David Lynch has never been a commercial director, you're right about that. Twin Peaks was almost a fluke in it's popularity. And yet he's always been a consistent director, with a loyal fan base and a following that generally assures a healthy return on investment. And guess what, Mullholland Drive and Inland Empire(his last two films) were both sizable releases, with great critical acclaim and healthy box office performances.  And none of the actor's have gone on to anything great? Shit, man, have you IMDBd any of them? They've mostly gone on to modest success in television. Just because you aren't seeing them doesn't mean they've dropped off the face of the earth."

twinpeaks,31keh4,orgodefacto,2,Sun Apr 5 23:57:23 2015 UTC,Because he directed them.  He's David Fucking Lynch for Christ's sake.
twinpeaks,31keh4,LostInTheMovies,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:06:11 2015 UTC,"Check out the screenplays, especially for the final episode. It's because he directed them! Or, if we want to split hairs, because he re-wrote them. But a) that was only because he was directing them, and b) no one else could have done what he did with them. As Michael J. Anderson said, there was no indication of the final result in the written word. How do you ""write"" something like the final Lodge sequence? Only the visuals and soundscape can do it true justice. TV is not generally seen as a director's medium but in Lynch's hands it becomes one."
twinpeaks,31keh4,LostInTheMovies,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:30:23 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree, though, to be fair in the case of the screenplay being different for the finale episode, it is because, as you said, he didn't take part in it at the writing stage and did re-writes while filming.   That is to say, if he had actually written the episode to begin with, perhaps what would've ended up on screen would've been at least closer (if not necessarily identical) to what was on the page.   I do agree though that Lynch brings a ton of ideas in the shooting and editing process, where other directors tend to treat scripts like gospel (to be fair, typically television directors don't have the freedom to do that, as Lynch did)"
twinpeaks,31keh4,LostInTheMovies,1 point,Wed Apr 8 08:40:34 2015 UTC,"There is some truth to this, certainly, but it's also worth noting that he chose not to write the episode and then also chose to ""wing it"" in a more unconventional way (according to the actors there was no script on set, although he must have had some idea what he wanted to do since he those contact lenses and various props ready and waiting). So in that sense the rewrite can be considering part of his directing process - something that occurs when he's actually in the mode of executing the project rather than just conceptualizing it.  Nothing else is as dramatic as the finale, but recently I checked out some of the scripts and it was interesting to see that he consistently changed stuff in other episodes too (one notable example: Audrey's dance in the diner was not scripted - her scene with Donna took place outside a church with very different dialogue).  It's always curious to me how little Lynch wrote for Twin Peaks (3 episodes co-written with Frost & 1 story credit), whereas he almost always writes/co-writes his features. Never been sure why; I guess something about the conventions of TV writing (the writer's room, all that) just didn't sit well with him?"
twinpeaks,31keh4,milligna,1 point,Wed Apr 8 08:47:39 2015 UTC,"It could just be a case of television being written so far in advance, that he didn't like sitting in the writer's room for situations like that. I was just looking through the credits on wikipedia, and was too actually shocked when I realize how little he had written. And also that Episode 1 wasn't directed by him. For whatever reason I was certain that he had done the Pilot + 1 + 2.   I think that aforementioned error gives me some slight hope that if the show is still made without him (which I'd prefer, just because I have to know what happens to Coop), that his influence on script alone can still result in a solid episode (as I said, I shamefully didn't realize Episode 1 wasn't directed by him).   Anyway, though, I'm still on pins and needles hoping/praying for him to come back."
twinpeaks,31keh4,titanium-of-chasm,1 point,Wed Apr 8 08:58:34 2015 UTC,I hope at the very least he directs the final episode.

twinpeaks,31keh4,pelley,5,Wed Apr 8 16:31:43 2015 UTC,"I was pretty bummed after hearing David Lynch wouldn't be directing, but if he's still writing alongside Mark Frost then I suppose it doesn't look too bad after all.  The only thing I'm worried about is if the directors that do work on the episodes end up trying too hard to replicate his style or just without any style similar to the previous seasons at all."
twinpeaks,31keh4,BasketeerOverHere,2,Tue Apr 7 19:00:10 2015 UTC,"I'll give them the benefit of the doubt (whoever they get to direct, aside from Frost). And I'll say that there's probably enough people out there that have been heavily influenced by Lynch's works that they manage to do some justice.  My knee-jerk reaction was like many others. All doom and gloom. But after talking with a close friend about the news leaks on TPs future, I started to think about it more and believe things can be alright. All I need now is for some reassurance that the cast is staying despite Lynch's departure."
twinpeaks,31keh4,ForrestFireDW,7,Mon Apr 6 01:19:07 2015 UTC,Twin Peaks without David Lynch would be like watching a cover band. It's just not the real thing.
twinpeaks,31keh4,brownsugar91,6,Mon Apr 6 02:20:44 2015 UTC,"Lynch and Frost spent somewhere around 5 years writing and fine-tuning the story for the new season, so enough of Lynch's influence is in this project for us to all be able to feel his presence, even if he's not behind the camera. So yes, I will definitely still watch it. Of course I'd prefer if he directed, but it's not like he completely had no say in the story, because he co-wrote the whole thing. If Frost or someone else just started writing a third season and Lynch was never apart of the creative team then I might not watch, but that's not the way it went down."
twinpeaks,31keh4,linktm,5,Mon Apr 6 10:19:05 2015 UTC,Depends if any cast will drop out due to this.
twinpeaks,31keh4,tronbrain,3,Mon Apr 6 00:32:03 2015 UTC,No. I will not watch it. Even though Lynch only directed 6 episodes he still had access to what would go on in the show. Just the fact that he wont be involved with the revival project makes me not want to watch it. It just wont be the same without him.
twinpeaks,31keh4,Cardow,3,Mon Apr 6 00:12:01 2015 UTC,It couldn't be any worse than some of Season 2's later episodes.
twinpeaks,31keh4,schleppylundo,3,Mon Apr 6 11:46:07 2015 UTC,Good news though - Diane Keaton has agreed to step in and direct as many episodes as necessary.
twinpeaks,31keh4,slmiami,3,Mon Apr 6 14:08:14 2015 UTC,"Some directors are good and can take what's on the page and bring it to life. Some directors are great and can make the audience re-evaluate the material. Some directors are masters and can shape the script in a way no one thought possible. Some directors are iconoclasts and without their involvement, there would be no movie and no point. Lynch is such a director. This is not simply a visual style or some preferred archetypes, this is someone from whom the entire piece needs to be borne or there is nothing at all.  Like giving a Hemingway story outline to a different writer and expecting the novel to result in the same thing, or having someone paint the same subject and expecting a Picasso. This is not Star Wars where any number of talented directors can be given the reins and we can expect a good result. This is one of the few film directors who ever lived that we can assuredly say has truly authored his work. Twin Peaks without Lynch already happened, no one wants to sit through that again."
twinpeaks,31keh4,BasketeerOverHere,5,Mon Apr 6 19:14:32 2015 UTC,Well the scripts won't be the same because Lynch said they wouldn't put enough money to shoot them the way they deserved to be shot
twinpeaks,31keh4,Iswitt,2,Tue Apr 7 01:24:48 2015 UTC,"That's the money Lynch thinks they need. Nothing here suggests to me that another director couldn't take the script, realize it fully, and make it great art all within Showtime's budget. Will it be the same as if Lynch directed? No, but we can't say for sure that it's better or worse."
twinpeaks,31keh4,EverythingIThink,9,Sun Apr 5 23:23:47 2015 UTC,"The thread poses a legitimate question, but I say it is moot: there is no way Twin Peaks will come back without Lynch's full participation."

twinpeaks,31keh4,DrNotEscalator,4,Mon Apr 6 00:24:18 2015 UTC,A younger generation of directors might be more keen about properly channeling Lynch's style than the alternate directors they had back in the day. It could still be good!

twinpeaks,31keh4,ChuckEye,2,Mon Apr 6 02:28:50 2015 UTC,I'd at least give it a shot and watch the first couple episodes.

twinpeaks,31keh4,JohnEbin,4,Mon Apr 6 18:09:14 2015 UTC,Would you watch Firefly if it came back without Joss?    The answer is no to both.
twinpeaks,31keh4,FloydPink24,3,Mon Apr 6 00:36:27 2015 UTC,"Joss only directed 3 of the 14 Firefly episodes. Lynch only directed 6 of the 30 Twin Peaks episodes. So 1/5. I wouldn't have an issue watching either show directed by others, so long as the scripts were still penned by those creators."
twinpeaks,31keh4,Iswitt,1 point,Mon Apr 6 04:17:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but do we really want to relive Season 2 after the reveal, sans the last episode? Those were horrible. Lynch directed and wrote the best episodes. It was nice having Frost reel in Lynch too when he went too...Lynch (as seen in the movie ""Fire Walk With Me."""
twinpeaks,31keh4,L_Palmer,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:10:20 2015 UTC,"The script by David Lynch and Mark Frost is already written which is good. On the other hand Lynch is such a good director and I think the quality will be significantly impacted without him. Just look at the episodes of TP he directed (and the movie) and how great they were. Also the original script of the final episode of season 2 vs. the actually directed version.  Also the fact that he is departing because of budget issues and he is talking about creative freedom isn't a good sign either. Obviously they aren't getting the creative control they want which could be a bad thing.  I'll probably watch it anyway regardless, I'm sure it may still be good, but my hopes aren't as high as before. Maybe they will compromise and convince David Lynch to direct certain episodes of the series instead of doing them all."
twinpeaks,31keh4,tronbrain,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:27:33 2015 UTC,"I'll probably watch, but he will be a huge miss. I don't think it's as simple as 'get another good TV director' because the way the show is so unlike others. It's really tailored around Lynch.   Still hoping some kind of agreement could be found, but a little magic is certainly lost if it goes ahead without him. No one can do Lynch like Lynch."

twinpeaks,31keh4,jasenlee,1 point,Mon Apr 6 09:24:01 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't/won't. This is his and Mark's idea and their second chance of doing it exactly they want to do it after the network messed it up the first time. It's their project, and I was so happy that they will be the sole writers and there will be no guest directors, that they will be able to present it exactly as they intended in the first place. With Lynch gone I simply have no interest in watching it. Think of all those ideas he got during the filming, Bob and all, and take that away, it just won't live up to its full potential. And considering that the cast and crew weren't only coworkers but also friends I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of them back out as well. A lot of people are saying oh but there are other good directors that could replicate his style and tone (though I doubt it) I just don't want that, I don't want an imitation, I want the real thing or nothing at all."
twinpeaks,31keh4,LostInTheMovies,1 point,Mon Apr 6 12:41:40 2015 UTC,"Without Lynch directing at least a few of the episodes, IMO, this whole project is DOA. And frankly, that's fine by me."

Certainly I'm curious enough to watch it eventually but how sad if they replace the powerful final image of Fire Walk With Me with something non-Lynch-directed as our farewell to Twin Peaks. Given the recent cast video, I don't think this is an option. I think Lynch will direct or the series won't happen."
twinpeaks,31keh4,Hans_Gucci,3,Tue Apr 7 05:22:15 2015 UTC,I definitely will. My love of Twin Peaks really has nothing to do with David Lynch. I've never seen anything of Lynch's(other than the Twin Peaks episodes he's directed). Hopefully Frost is still attached though
twinpeaks,31keh4,GaijinSama,4,Wed Apr 8 08:38:24 2015 UTC,"I recommend you do go and watch his other work. He doesn't have an extensive resume with movies, but they're still really good.

twinpeaks,31keh4,PaysWith2DollarBills,3,Sun Apr 5 23:06:16 2015 UTC,"As the other poster said, I think Blue Velvet has the most tonal overlap with Twin Peaks.

twinpeaks,31kost,medrolific,3,Mon Apr 6 00:58:51 2015 UTC,The idea for a kickstarter on this would be historic if done correctly.   Imagine all the projects stuck in development hell because of matters like this get resolved by the fans.  Boom history.
twinpeaks,31kost,Prometheus357,3,Mon Apr 6 01:05:54 2015 UTC,"I'd donate the shit out of it. But, for whatever reason, I don't think David Lynch sees Kickstart as viable for Twin Peaks (maybe the budget is too high up). I know a documentary about him was Kickstarted, and he was involved in it. But, with Showtime presumably having invested money into the project already, it might be too complicated legally."
twinpeaks,31kost,LittleRudiger,1 point,Mon Apr 6 01:00:48 2015 UTC,"Let's say, hypothetically, that a kickstarter campaign was an option (and for the sake of your probably-correct assumption that the budget would be astronomical), would you think it plausible that it could be met through fans? Twin Peaks and David Lynch fans worldwide would probably donate, even just a little bit. The Showtime ownership would obviously be a hurtle, but if the money were funneled directly to them to then meet Lynch's needs, could it work?"
twinpeaks,31kost,LittleRudiger,2,Mon Apr 6 01:21:53 2015 UTC,"I mean, Veronica Mars made $5 million. I believe that's the highest grossing film kickstarter to date.   It's hard to say. I mean, there is definitely a huge David Lynch audience, but, there isn't an adequate comparison (in terms of a long revered filmmaker using Kickstarter, rather than recent indie darlings). I wish like, there was a bllionaire who was a big Lynch fan who'd just call up Showtime and offer to foot the bill.   Where's Megan Ellison when you need her!"

twinpeaks,31hg9e,reinevogue,15,Sun Apr 5 02:52:29 2015 UTC,"There's only one official version of Fire Walk With Me. There's the Missing Pieces, which are deleted or extended scenes, but the FWWM that made it to theaters was the official director's cut. People tend to forget that Lynch has had final cut on all of his movies since Dune, and the version he sent out to theaters was the version he wanted people to see. Of course, if given an unlimited runtime to work with, he may have put those deleted scenes into the movie, but I think it's worth noting that, given the chance, Lynch didn't put them back into the movie himself.  But, those deleted scenes are all excellent, and should be required viewing after you've seen FWWM the theatrical version. I know there's a couple fanedits out there that put the scenes back in, but I think you should watch the theatrical version first. It'll make it that much cooler to watch the deleted scenes and see the stuff that had to be pulled. After that, you can choose whichever version you want to rewatch.  And yes, FWWM is much darker and scarier than the TV show. It basically drops the quirky humor but keeps the supernatural weirdness, which gives the movie a very ugly, offputting feel. Intentionally so, of course; the movie is basically an inversion of the television show(the opening shot makes that very clear). But there is humor there, albeit in a dark, gallows sense, and I think it has some unimaginable beauty in it. And it also has one of the single most unnerving scenes I've ever seen in a movie."

twinpeaks,31hg9e,GaijinSama,10,Mon Apr 6 01:22:49 2015 UTC,"FWWM is a horror movie, no doubt about it.  It is unnerving and disturbing.  The movie didn't get great reviews when it first came out, but I think it aged well.  Sheryl Lee is phenomenal in it.    Watching it isn't necessary to enjoying Twin Peaks, but it broadens your understanding, expands the TP world, and puts things into different perspectives."
twinpeaks,31hg9e,TubaMike,3,Sun Apr 5 04:26:11 2015 UTC,"FWWM is a huge tonal shift from the show, and the best way to think of it is to realize that the perspective is different. In the TV show, the town of Twin Peaks was being presented to us through the eyes of Cooper, so everything was weird in a delightful way, homely, and charming. FWWM is told through the perspective of Laura, who has a much darker outlook on life and her town, so everything is inherently more tragic and less magical."
twinpeaks,31hg9e,douko,2,Sun Apr 5 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"Should I watch FWWM then rewatch? Or after my rewatch?   the canonical answer on this i think is to watch FWWM after the rewatch. that's always the order i do it. now, of course, it's series, FWWM, missing pieces"

It seems to have been a hit with the Reddit community so far! (In fact, that's how I came to discover this fine forum.)  Since you've already seen Twin Peaks, it might be interesting to watch the film first this time. In a way it will be like a coda (which is how it was intended), since you've recently seen the show. In another way, it will be like a prologue for the series (it is, after all, a prequel). It will also give you a new perspective on the show this time around.  And yes, it is frightening!  (Also, watch the version that's on DVD or blu-ray not the extended fanedit with the deleted scenes. They're a lot of fun, but Lynch cut them for a reason - they don't belong intermingled with Laura's story.)"

twinpeaks,318z1h,crypticthree,2,Fri Apr 3 07:25:58 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if it's evil. I think it's more like supernatural. At the end of FWWM when Laura sees the angel she is illuminated by flickering blue light (like that of a TV screen)
twinpeaks,318z1h,LaunchOurRocket,2,Fri Apr 3 14:11:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe.  It's certainly a constant image he uses."
twinpeaks,318z1h,nonghost,2,Fri Apr 3 16:42:26 2015 UTC,I also always thought the bird at the end of Blue Velvet and in the opening titles of Twin Peaks was also an interesting parallel.  In many ways Blue Velvet is a better Twin Peaks movie than the actual Twin Peaks movie.

twinpeaks,318z1h,crypticthree,11,Fri Apr 3 01:53:35 2015 UTC,FWWM has a jarring tonal gap from the show because its highlighting the vast difference between how Dale experiences the town and how Laura did before her death.

twinpeaks,316pio,PanTroglodyte,1 point,Fri Apr 3 08:13:00 2015 UTC,There's a sequel to Twin Peaks in which Dale Cooper is the son of a great lord and has to save the planet arrakis and become the kwisatz haderach while destroying the imperial guild and its monopoly on the essential spice known as melange. You should check it out.

They were filming the concert professionally for something.  Jules Cruise was scheduled to appear but did NOT with no excuse :(   Lots of celebs in attendance including Kimmy Robertson (she looks great,) Jim Carey and Michael Sheen.  Event was co sponsored with Showtime.  No mention on new Twin Peaks.    http://imgur.com/MMWcgHx"

twinpeaks,3178y4,DayoftheDead,2,Sat Apr 4 09:45:15 2015 UTC,"Hearing ""Dance of the Dream Man"" and ""Sycamore Trees"" made me so damned happy. Badalamenti's style and tone just speaks on a special level."
