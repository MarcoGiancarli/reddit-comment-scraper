I'm hoping maybe they bought one of their own shirts at some point... The cynic in me says it's just a sales ploy though. But I'm a cynical bastard sometimes.  I do think it's a little dodgy to post something that you're selling without saying it's your creation, but maybe that's just me. I'm always a little dubious with these tee creation stores, I've seen too much stolen content on them so it's soured me in general on them.   Not saying any of this is true in this case.

Sometimes I pretend like I have three kids, and these are their bikes. Tina: Which one's your favorite? Teddy: Jeremy. He needs me the most. The twins have each other. Louise: Whoa. Teddy: Sometimes I come in here just so I can trip over them. I'll be like, Ah, the kids left their bikes here again!  I feel like that's the saddest thing Teddy's ever said."
BobsBurgers,3dwx2e,Tgrooms,120,Mon Jul 20 07:28:52 2015 UTC,"My saddest thing Teddy said was when he was in the Belcher's apartment and he said something like 'Aww, Bobby's got everything.' It was, superficially, about some tangible tchochki, but on a deeper level it was a different perspective on Bob and his family. The Belchers aren't well off and Bob's pretty exasperated and doesn't have much in his life that he thinks makes him happy. But to Teddy, Bob has everything you could want in life. A loving wife, 3 good kids, his own business where people come in and talk to you. But it wasn't said in a jealous way. Just a forelorn way, I guess."

And to be quite honest, I had a weird vibe from her, like ""Yeah, I killed him, but he had it coming and not just from my point of view, but from most people's"". That last look makes me question that, but still.  The show also kept dropping hints about a first or second wife and about how he wasn't good towards Helen. I felt like they wanted to tell more about their relationship, but they had to cut stuff out and this was it."

I think they are split between the East and West coast now- so less of that impromptu back and forth makes it into the show.   Apologies if I have misunderstood what you are referring to.

The feel of the show does seem less improvisational these days.  In a 2013 article Eugene Mirman says they record together over the internet, but I have no idea if that is still the case: Splitsider Article   Do you record Bob’s Burgers in LA or is that in New York?  We record it at the same time in both New York and LA. That’s the other reason I don’t move to LA is that I have work in New York. I like working in projects with friends, but I don’t necessarily want to audition to just be in random stuff. I’d rather work on projects with friends and my own projects. So a lot of the advantage of LA is that you’d just be in tons of stuff. And also, you’d be with a lot of friends who have all abandoned New York City for the glory of Los Angeles.  So the whole cast records Bob’s Burgers together?–  We’re all together online, half in New York and half in LA, so we’re actually recording it live all together."

I don't guess it counts since it wasn't really voluntary, but he did offer to make out with Chef Duval during ""Mutiny on the Windbreaker."" And I'm sure there are other hints besides that one and the ""Turkey In a Can"" episode, but I'm blanking on them at the moment. :0"
BobsBurgers,3doucb,LettuceKetchupPod,3,Sat Jul 18 05:41:01 2015 UTC,"I think Turkey in the Can confirms it. ""I'm straight, I mean, I'm mostly straight"" something like that."
BobsBurgers,3doucb,TheGallifreyan,4,Sat Jul 18 12:38:46 2015 UTC,"I think he replies with ""I'm mostly straight"" because he would rather have the turkey guy think he's coming on to him than for him to think he's a bad cook."

I kind of chalked it up to Bob being frustrated and upset about his turkeys, he wanted to escape. I think he may have been in such a high level that he was tempted to runaway and the deli have him an opportunity."

When you get older, life becomes less about sex and more about just making it through the day sometimes.  Gay, straight, bi, whatever, it doesn't matter when you're worried about a mortgage.    Do I think bob is Bi?  No, I think he's monogamously attracted to Linda, and that's that.  But sometimes if he does something that makes you question his sexuality, it's less about his gender preferences and more about just getting through whatever situation he's in."

Obviously much of the episode is an homage to The Shining. So the painting sort of does double duty as a reference to both BB and The Shining. And if you like Stephen King, then it sort of does triple duty, as this is one of the only scenes in The Shining that references the main topic of King's original book ... alcoholism.  This was one of those early episodes that really made me like the show."

BobsBurgers,3dgyy4,crickettekeeper,9,Thu Jul 16 05:47:54 2015 UTC,"Would love to see origin story to back when they where together. They end up getting divorced because jimmy cant contain his need to wear diapers and play ""baby num nums"" with hookers. The mom is so depressed she has a mental break down and only gets granted partial visitation. Leading to the current state of jimmy having primary custody even though he is an all accounts a shitty father. I like to think Trev is her brother and jimmy treats him so mean because of the resentment for her."
BobsBurgers,3dgyy4,knot353,10,Thu Jul 16 06:58:16 2015 UTC,"That's an amazing idea. What I think may make it cooler would be if we kind of saw glimpses of the Belcher's adventure in it. Like take a storyline from one of the earlier episodes or create a new one then show that storyline in a later episode. I think it would be an interesting way of doing an origin story. Both families in their early years of their restaurants. Maybe Jimmy Pesto opened his restaurant after Bob. It could start there. Bob doubting its ability to last, but being neighbourly goes over to greet Pesto. Something goes wry and Bob gets upset. Thus the beginning of the rivalry."

BobsBurgers,3ddpe6,PrettyPsycho,6,Wed Jul 15 14:10:10 2015 UTC,"I think that kind of stuff is partly what sets Bobs Burgers apart from most other (animated) sitcoms. The Belchers are not dysfunctional or hate/humiliate each other. They are weird, make jokes about each other, but those moments really show that there actually is a positive side, even in weirdo-families. Its the little things, like Bob's chuckle in 'Hamburger Dinner Theatre', after Linda bursts out into a song, right after Bob told her she would do so and that it is tedious. Also, most of the characters in the series are plain weird or odd, but they are not the ones to be made fun of; instead, those that are assholes are. Man, I could write all day about how positive that show is compared to others, while it is still hilarious. I hope it stays on air for a long time."
BobsBurgers,3ddpe6,blackbasset,3,Wed Jul 15 22:32:33 2015 UTC,"I feel the exact same way. It's sad the show is going to have a certain stigma attached to it because it's a cartoon comedy intended for a more mature audience, and Family Guy has practically ruined that genre.   The way the Belcher family interacts feels so real. Sure they're a bunch of weirdos, but being weird is a standard family activity.   Also, the Belcher family is one of the most accurate depictions of an American working class family on television, and I think that alone deserves high praise."

BobsBurgers,3cu46j,G0PACKGO,12,Sat Jul 11 02:42:42 2015 UTC,"Funny thing is, ""Bob"" here looks more like Eugene Mirman IRL than Bob on the show."
BobsBurgers,3cu46j,baljot187,16,Sat Jul 11 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"Well since Eugene looks like Gene and Gene looks like Bob, it kinda makes sense."
BobsBurgers,3cu46j,FamilyGuyGuy7,7,Sat Jul 11 01:36:09 2015 UTC,So basically he's Gene when he decided to be Bob.

They're just being given license to draw the comic in their own personal styles, something that's not possible to do in the show.  You can check the art credits for the comic against the Bob's listings on the IMDb to see for yourself."

BobsBurgers,3cooev,spacemanspiff30,5,Thu Jul 9 21:26:21 2015 UTC,"Definitely know that feeling! Unfortunately I'm uninformed on the ways of the RSS, but we'll be submitting for iTunes approval very soon, and I'll probably mention it here as soon as we get it going. :)  Edit: Not sure if this helps, but here's our soundcloud RSS link: http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:156687335/sounds.rss"
BobsBurgers,3cooev,spacemanspiff30,3,Thu Jul 9 23:13:49 2015 UTC,"Will you be posting it on any other services such as podbean or libsyn for those of us that don't use itunes but third party podcast programs on Android? I ask because my podcast player doesn't seem to want to download any of the shows from the soundcloud rss feed.   I can still make it work, but it's a pain through soundcloud to download and I don't get service a lot of times, so can't stream. But I do love the idea and can't wait to listen to the shows."
BobsBurgers,3cooev,spacemanspiff30,2,Fri Jul 10 00:21:55 2015 UTC,"It doesn't especially help that I'm clueless about helping listeners get the RSS to work, hehe. Sorry to hear about the trouble, and it's a great idea to look into other services. I'll be sure to link them if/when we get that going. In the meantime, thanks for checking us out!"
BobsBurgers,3cooev,siriusthinking,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:32:50 2015 UTC,"No worries, just putting it out there as I imagine I can't be the only one and would love to be able to hear them every week since I don't use soundcloud at all if I can avoid it. I find the UI to be horrendous. But it has its advantages for producers, so I know why people use it.   Please keep posting your updates."

In a similar vein, when he's trying to be serious, but someone makes a joke and he runs with it, like in Lindapendent Woman, where they're trying to figure out how to save money. Bob says, ""What are some things we can live without?"" And Louise counters with ""Probably Gene and Tina."" Bob: ""That's a good start."" Gene: ""Well that makes the things I was going to cut irrelevant."" Bob: ""Goood..."" definitely one of my favorite moments."

BobsBurgers,3c62lb,Forthepuppies,2,Sun Jul 5 05:18:58 2015 UTC,What makes you think Zeek has a crush on Tina? I can see the Jimmy Jr. point.
BobsBurgers,3c62lb,notsoclassyadventure,4,Wed Jul 8 08:29:32 2015 UTC,"During the mad pooper incident, Tina confronts Zeek and asks him why he did it. He says that he had to poop, then in was for fun, and then he was doing it for her (because she was investigating the story at the time).  There's also the episode (I apologize, I can't remember which on this is) where he jokes about wearing her down (the way I remember it, he was commenting about them going out)."
BobsBurgers,3c62lb,Forthepuppies,2,Wed Jul 8 14:31:16 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah! I know which one you're talking about. Hm, never considered it before but it might be a good plot line for a future episode."
BobsBurgers,3c62lb,notsoclassyadventure,2,Thu Jul 9 00:16:49 2015 UTC,"I ship them together as life long couple. He's outgoing, silly and sure of himself. He might be have low grades and an unstable home life. Whereas Tina wants to be outgoing, she's not afraid of being silly and just needs a little bit more self confidence I take it back, she has self confidence, just no charisma, which again, Zeek has. She seems to be doing well at school and her home life is very stable.   They compliment each other so well."
BobsBurgers,3c62lb,Forthepuppies,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:16:38 2015 UTC,"I also meant to add that in a recent episode, Zeek tells her he likes her. At the time, she's holding Zeek and Jimmy Jr. at gun balloon point, so it may be a lie, but I still think there's something there."
BobsBurgers,3c62lb,Forthepuppies,12,Fri Jul 10 05:10:02 2015 UTC,"Jimmy Jr. is a man child.  He's that awkward age where his body has out stripped his emotional development.  His raging hormones, which you see more obviously represented in Tina, are flooding his body with new feelings.  But he retains a sense of his childlike innocence and channels this new passion into what he understands better; Dance.  Just as Tina is somewhat obsessed with her budding sexuality and we see it represented by her obsession with butts, erotic fiction, and zombies, so too do we see Jimmy obsessed with dance.  Sometimes it's aggressive, sometimes it's sensual, but it's always passionate.  I would argue that part of his rivalry with Josh was less about Tina (though it started that way) and more about the fact that he was a TRAINED dancer.  There are two things that are suggestive of Jimmy being gay.  The first is his omnipresent friendship with Zeke.  But of course this in itself doesn't mean anything.  A lot of older boys have strong friendships with one other boy.  That's normal really.  The other is his speech impediment.  Forgive me for generalizing, but it's similar to the stereotypical 'gay lisp'.  BUT it's not quite there.  It's suggestive without directly pointing to that stereotype.  But you notice no one else in the Pesto/Poplopovich family has any sort of speech impediment.   Is Jimmy gay?  I think it's too early to tell yet, and in my opinion this should never be something that goes away.  Hopefully 5 seasons from now, people are still wondering about this.  It's one aspect of this beautiful show that makes it such a work of art."
BobsBurgers,3c62lb,Rhev,2,Sun Jul 5 10:57:20 2015 UTC,"I've always felt that if there was anything going on between Zeek and Jimmy Jr., it came from Zeek.

BobsBurgers,3c62lb,kvloxx,4,Sun Jul 5 05:49:40 2015 UTC,"I do wonder if it might be that he feared she felt Josh was a better dancer, so she went with him. Just that his skills were threatened, not that he would care if she was doting on him or not."

It has the same format as the previous series, but this time Bob's Fantasy Food Truck Concept Art replaces his burger of the day, and Linda's Attempt to Take a Nice Family Picture in Front of the Restaurant replaces her letters. They are both one page each, and I felt they were lacking in this first issue.   Both sections by Tina and Louise remain the same: Erotic Friend Fiction and Unsolved Mysteries. Gene's musical section was slightly retooled as Rhymey Rhymes That Could One Day Be Songs, but still follows the same format.  Overall I felt the issue was pretty good, with Tina stealing the show. Keep in mind I didn't really like the first series, but decided to give the new one a shot. My main concern is the formatting (I'd rather have episodic stories) but this #1 had some good and funny moments. The art was varied and great.   Worth picking up!"

This not only make reactions more natural, but allows for this kind of ad-libbed amazingness to take place.

BobsBurgers,3azqem,JustCallMeAlex,41,Wed Jun 24 20:25:46 2015 UTC,"Early Simpsons was a bit more challenging to the social norms of the time.  It's hard to remember but it used to be a very controversial show.  A working class, dysfunctional family in some ways left behind by the American Dream as a reaction to more perfect sitcom families of the time.  Lisa was intellectually and emotionally suffocated and Bart was a complete failure in school.  Homer was basically a dumb brute and Marge was so unhappy she seriously considered cheating on him.   I don't think BB really does any of that sort of thing, but I also think maybe it just doesn't need to be done as much compared to when the Simpsons were new.  Society has changed for the better in a lot of ways."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,furiousxgeorge,21,Thu Jun 25 01:08:39 2015 UTC,"This is all totally true, and well-expressed.  But Bob's Burgers is a true successor in the fact that it pushes away the norms of contemporary culture in the way that the Simpsons pushed away societal norms. Ever since The Office got big in 05, cynicism, sarcasm, and irony rule the day in terms of our most beloved entertainment. Bob's Burgers is a reaction to and rebuttal of that trend, in the sense that it rejects cynicism in favor of a moralistic show about a loving family trying their best in an unfair world. There is a heart and soul in Bob's Burgers that I haven't seen in a show in a long time (outside of Parks and Rec), because hopelessness and darkness commonly prevails. The moral center of this show is also really reminiscent of the Simpsons."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,I_SPLIT_INFINITIVES,11,Thu Jun 25 05:01:31 2015 UTC,It's very much like Parks and Rec in an 'us vs. the world' way.  One thing I love about Bob's Burgers is the lack of plots that revolve around conflict between the kids.

BobsBurgers,3azqem,chakrablocker,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:48:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It works great paired with the MacFarlane shows because, as much as I love them, there isn't a lot of heart there. The contrast really highlights what BB does so right."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,furiousxgeorge,-2,Fri Jun 26 05:42:18 2015 UTC,"...shouldn't it be I_INFINITIVES_SPLIT?  Edit: okay, I get it. That's not a split infinitive."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,fiftytwohertz,3,Thu Jun 25 05:47:10 2015 UTC,"Nah man that's not how it works.  An infinitive form of a verb is like ""to go"" or ""to walk""  To split an infinitive, you place a word in between the two words of the infinitive, like ""to boldly go"" or ""to quickly walk."" The general feeling is that you're not supposed to do it, but it's not technically/officially against the rules. Sort of like ending a sentence in a preposition (which I also do because fuck you I'm a grammatical rebel.)"

BobsBurgers,3azqem,I_SPLIT_INFINITIVES,2,Fri Jun 26 00:56:06 2015 UTC,Hey I'm a professional writer! Editorial fistbump ✊🏻
BobsBurgers,3azqem,fiftytwohertz,6,Fri Jun 26 00:58:38 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, and I'd argue that BB shows another family left behind by the American Dream as well. I love the line in Hawk & Chick where Bob says to Louise ""We're poor but happy"". I think maybe you are right, The Simpsons did a lot more in challenging the societal norms of the time and showing that a family can be dysfunctional and perfectly happy. But at the same time, BB also shows this dysfunctional family centered around Bob and his dream.  I think when you look at BB they take a lot of these themes and present them for a modern audience. I don't think Marge was as unhappy as you think she was, but it's true that her and Homer never had a perfect marriage. I don't think Linda and Bob do either, and I think like Homer/Marge they love each other but love their kids more. Like I said in the original post, the shows do a lot of things differently than each other and maybe they don't need to be compared. But I do see them as similar shows in different era, sort of counter parts across a generation."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,saintsorfools,4,Thu Jun 25 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"That quote from Hawk & Chick really triggered something for me but I couldn't put my finger on it until right now! In Fantastic Mr. Fox, Mrs. Fox has almost the same line, ""We are poor… but we're happy"", to which Mr. Fox replies ""Comme-ci, come-ca"". Now I need to go watch that movie for the 20th time."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,saintsorfools,7,Thu Jun 25 03:42:35 2015 UTC,"Such a great movie. I remember reading the cast list for the movie and thinking, ""Holy crap, no way they're getting all these amazing actors for this little animated film"". Didn't realize it was going to be such a masterpiece. I think maybe even underrated, but I know it's generally loved by those who've seen it."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,archpope,2,Thu Jun 25 03:58:20 2015 UTC,"Wes Anderson can definitely pull together an amazing cast for any of his projects. I have watched that film so many times and it brings me new joy with each viewing! It definitely deserves all the praise it gets, but I'd agree it's a bit disregarded-for lack of a better word. I'd say more due to being lesser known more than underrated."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,drmeattornado,15,Thu Jun 25 22:08:13 2015 UTC,"One little thing I enjoy about Bob's character.  Its subtle, but I've seen it a few times.  When one of the kids does or says something over the line, which is usually funny, Bob chastises them but is briefly amused at what they said or did.  He's just a good loving father, no matter how goofy the storylines get."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,nongshim,10,Thu Jun 25 04:23:15 2015 UTC,"So true, I think a good example is the ""Don't have a crap attack"" line that he throws around...him and Louise love that and so did I. He's just as goofy as his kids are, in a more controlled manner. That's why I love when Bob is drunk, or high, he let's his inhibitions go and acts like a grown child."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,I_SPLIT_INFINITIVES,12,Thu Jun 25 04:56:22 2015 UTC,"I would like to make a counter-proposal: I think due to the relative level of realism (i.e., if it can't happen in real life, it won't happen on Bob's Burgers), it's more a spiritual successor to King of the Hill. Even excluding the Halloween specials and the ""peek into the future"" episodes, the Simpsons have had to deal with plenty of impossible situations, such as walking to a convenience store at the top of a mountain, tomacco, other radiation-related accidents, even Kang and Kodos showing up in a regular episode. king of the Hill kept it real, as does Bob's Burgers.   I think this is further driven home by fansites that have done things like make the Burgers of the Day or determine what real-life city the show takes place in or what the value of the building they live in is.  I can sorta see your point, I just think King of the Hill is a better candidate for spiritual antecedent than The Simpsons.  EDIT: Another point along those lines: Bob is not an idiot, nor is he mean. Homer is almost always an idiot (though nowhere near to the degree that Peter Griffin is) and can sometimes be mean. Bob's a down-to-earth kind of person who loves his family and his job (which he's really good at), just like Hank Hill."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,sa87,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:16:42 2015 UTC,"I have yet to see King of the Hill in it's entirety. What I did see of it did not impress me, but I am willing to give it another go.   I said in another comment as well, when something runs as long as The Simpsons it's difficult to keep things realistic without rehashing old ideas. The Simpsons did it! phrasing is such an apt way to say, well they have pretty much done everything at this point (and well before this point) that they branched out into the abstract to keep content fresh. But to me the first 10 seasons of The Simpsons are what I consider the true essence of the show.  I really can't comment on the King of the Hill stuff in this post, like I said I haven't seen the show. I would like to say I never intended to imply that Bob was a new Homer (even though I did use that phrase). What I meant was that Bob has a lot of the core traits that Homer has, especially when it comes to his family. And in such family centric shows, that what stands out to me the most.   But after all the love King of the Hill is getting in this post, I am going to have to start this show as soon as possible."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,nongshim,8,Thu Jun 25 22:31:22 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you've said. I would add one caveat. I would say this falls in line with the first 8-10 years of the Simpsons.  Much of the Family Guy complaints expressed I would also say about the Simpsons in more recent years.
BobsBurgers,3azqem,milkradio,5,Thu Jun 25 00:42:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it's been on air so long at this point that how many more realistic situations can they construct for the show that they haven't already done? I always think of the 'early' Simpsons when I think of the show because I think that was really the embodiment of what the show was all about."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,omnipotentmonkey,2,Thu Jun 25 02:39:28 2015 UTC,"I've said this before, but the Simpsons basically died for me at the Simpsons-Family Guy crossover"
BobsBurgers,3azqem,Tehdarkmp,6,Thu Jun 25 01:49:13 2015 UTC,"The heart of the Simpsons has been dead for at least 15 years, after the 11th season (if you're generous.)"

BobsBurgers,3azqem,Carcass1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:33:26 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. I go to Simpsons trivia nights sometimes, though I haven't been in a few months, and it only covers episodes between seasons 1 and 11. Personally I think it started getting a bit hit and miss in seasons 9 and 10, but the newer seasons still occasionally have a good episode. It's just disappointing that it's no longer consistently great and instead you get maybe one or two good episodes in a season :("
BobsBurgers,3azqem,iameveryone2011,15,Fri Jun 26 15:11:03 2015 UTC,"Perfectly Conveyed....  definitely agree on the point about the kids, Gene, Louise and Tina demonstrated more humour, personality and comedic versatility in the first EPISODE of BB than Meg or Chris have done after 249 episodes... Tina isn't just a punchline for neglect jokes like Meg, she's a character, with an identity, likes and dislikes, etc. Gene isn't just a less extreme copy-paste of his father like Chris is.  he's a flamboyant, eccentric, often confusing child who is often times way too confident for his own good. and Louise is what would happen if Stewie was written consistently to his original role but worked in more cohesively to be part of the family he occupies.  She's still machiavellian, a bit manipulative and more intelligent than her older siblings combined,  but she isn't outright evil, I love stewie, he's probably the one Family Guy family member who I still think works as a character, But Louise meshes better with the tone. (And Kristen Schaal has quickly become one of the best voice actresses for comedic kid characters ever,)"
BobsBurgers,3azqem,iameveryone2011,3,Wed Jun 24 23:05:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I love Stewie as well, but you are right he was never really written consistently...I don't think a character in Family Guy was. Besides maybe Quagmire. I've always said the kids in BB are the reason I fell in love with the show. The relationships between them, their actions, their stories and adventures in every episode. They are such natural siblings and show such a realistic bond between them. It builds towards the cohesive family that Family Guy just doesn't have. From the VA's down to the writers for them, the kids in BB steal the show by being real children in an animated world."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,Carcass1,2,Thu Jun 25 02:45:45 2015 UTC,"I love how the kids in BB actually talk, work out problems and actually love each other. You don't see any of that going on in family guy or even the Simpsons. That's what makes them so great."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,goodolbluey,3,Thu Jun 25 07:29:35 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I think Bart and Lisa have been shown to really care about each other plenty of times. There have been a lot of episodes about that:   ""Bart vs Thanksgiving"" where they fight until Bart finally accepts that he cares about hurting Lisa's feelings and gives her a genuine apology ""Lisa on Ice"" where they're in a showdown in a hockey game and they hug while leaving their game at a tie because they remember all the good times they had together growing up ""Lisa's First Word"" where you see Bart adjusting to no longer being an only child ""Stark Raving Dad"" where Bart writes a song with ""Michael Jackson"" for Lisa's birthday ""Separate Vocations"" where Bart takes the fall for Lisa when she steals all the teachers' editions of the textbooks to protect her from being expelled ""Bart Sells His Soul"" where Lisa tracks down Bart's ""soul"" and buys it from Comic Book Guy just so Bart can feel better ""Summer of 4ft2"" where (after screwing with her new friendships), Bart eventually gets Lisa's new friends together to do something nice for her as an apology ""'Round Springfield"" where Lisa is the only one to believe Bart when he says his stomach hurts and then once he gets $500 from his settlement, he spends it on a Bleeding Gums Murphy album for her so she can honour BGM's memory properly when he really wanted to buy ""the ultimate pog"" for himself   I agree that on Bob's Burgers, the kids are much more likely to immediately react like ""we're in this together"" for any problems any of them run into, which I love and find really refreshing, but Bart and Lisa definitely care about and support each other when they really need to. It just takes them a bit longer to get there because they have more of a sibling rivalry dynamic between them."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,alfonzo_squeeze,2,Fri Jun 26 15:27:08 2015 UTC,"Eh, Bart and Lisa have an interesting relationship. My personal favorite relationship in BB is between Louise and Gene, and I don't think Bart and Lisa share even a fraction of the bond Louise and Gene do. But they care for each other in their own way, and of course Maggie is a little baby but I also love the relationship she has with Lisa. I think Bart and Maggie really don't have any bond but in reality what 10 year old boy wants to spend extended time with his infant sister."
BobsBurgers,3azqem,iameveryone2011,3,Thu Jun 25 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"This is way over simplifying the analysis, but; both shows are about hyperbole and satire of their respective culture climate. The Simpson was brilliant in its time for it commentary on that atomic family, supported by over the top characters. BB is this decades the simpsons.  I hope there is more to come!! :)"
BobsBurgers,3azqem,DayOff4Superman,2,Thu Jun 25 03:14:14 2015 UTC,Thank you! Hopefully we get just as many seasons of BB as the Simpsons...I think BB can really have the longevity that the Simpsons has as well.

BobsBurgers,3azqem,Tehdarkmp,2,Thu Jun 25 05:27:30 2015 UTC,I'm definitely going to look into the show. I'll probably end up watching it from the beginning just because I'm one of those people who feels compelled to watch shows in chronological order. I was a bit younger when I first saw King of the Hill so maybe watching it now I'd appreciate it more.
BobsBurgers,3azqem,Screwbit,0,Thu Jun 25 05:32:27 2015 UTC,Definitely start at the beginning. The first couple seasons are among the best IMO.

BobsBurgers,3at3xp,SnatchDragon,3,Tue Jun 23 12:23:30 2015 UTC,"Spiceeps seems like a really dumb idea.  If you have to reach up high, there is a chance that all the spice could just fall onto your head."

BobsBurgers,3at3xp,1000hipsterpoints,2,Fri Jun 26 06:30:50 2015 UTC,also they flip upside down and around whenever you do anything.. Having the Spiceeps would be in the way and potentially spill spices everywhere.  With the Spicerack they just sit nicely in place and move around with you. They're definitely better.

Marketing wise I think spiceps would have sold better though. Sex does sell but I think spiceps would have sold on late night infomercials better.

I love ever character on this show, but Zeke has me coming back again and again for laughs and unbeatable quotes.  Even better, they took the time to explain Zeke, and why he's so different than the other seaside town kids.  One item I find confusing, is that Zeke is often brought into tenant events, like the ""Fishoeder Games"" episode.  My question is: Do we know Zeke's parents? Are they tenants of Mr. Fish? Have we seen then in show before?"
BobsBurgers,3acb50,douglife,2,Sun Jun 21 18:32:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think we have.  I think he honestly gets dragged along with Jimmy Jr to those things... But who knows.

BobsBurgers,3aced7,cayal3,11,Thu Jun 18 23:32:22 2015 UTC,I've noticed it's like an on-and-off thing for him. Sometimes he's an asshole and sometimes he's all for being with Tina. I figure he's going through some kind of adolescent development like her.
BobsBurgers,3aced7,TeddyJTran,6,Thu Jun 18 23:40:40 2015 UTC,Seems to be when he wants something or there's a threat.  Like the last episode of season 5 so Tina wouldn't water bomb him. But also the dance off episode with Josh. He wanted to keep his options open right until she told him she was going to Josh's dance.
BobsBurgers,3aced7,tardytheturtle6,10,Thu Jun 18 23:47:00 2015 UTC,"He's more into Tina when she's not falling all over herself for his attention, which seems fair.  I don't think it was the threat that got his attention but the way Tina was standing up, even to him.  Or the episode where Louise becomes Tina's translator and starts blowing Jimmy Jr off, which lands Tina a date with Jimmy Jr.  Even in the dance episode I think he's more bothered about Tina's lack of interest in him than the other boy, as they both leave the dance as friends.    I think they've made it fairly clear that Jimmy Jr. likes Tina when Tina is being Tina.  Sadly she rarely chooses to be herself around him and instead acts a bit like his doormat, and I think it's fair that he's not so into that."

BobsBurgers,3a4fog,corndoggy67,10,Wed Jun 17 04:02:45 2015 UTC,I think it'd be nearly impossible to do so
BobsBurgers,3a4fog,DrMoistPhappen,10,Wed Jun 17 04:47:05 2015 UTC,I don't think it'd be impossible.  Would require a lot of experimentation with the tartar and medium-well patties starting at various degrees of frozen.
BobsBurgers,3a4fog,Haff22,9,Wed Jun 17 08:18:58 2015 UTC,"Even if you froze the beef tartare, either it would start cooking or the burger would be rare at the point of contact. If you parcooked the burger in advance you could get a sharper transition."

BobsBurgers,3a4fog,Sobertese,5,Wed Jun 17 10:36:10 2015 UTC,It'd be hard to do as the burger is cooked medium well and beef tartar is raw. It does sound nice though.
BobsBurgers,3a4fog,satan-says-meow,7,Wed Jun 17 10:50:22 2015 UTC,What if you cooked the burger medium well then made a hole in the burger to make a little pocket for the beef tartar and and stuffed it in the burger?
BobsBurgers,3a4fog,duckxduckxgoose,7,Wed Jun 17 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"You'd have to do this after the medium well burger finished resting, or you'd cook the tartare. And then you'd have to be really quick about finishing the assembly and delivering it to the table, or you'd be giving them a cold burger.  Not saying it's impossible, but there's a reason why the show treats this burger as Bob's Ultimate Special Technique."

BobsBurgers,3a3uy4,_CitizenSnips_,10,Wed Jun 17 05:07:15 2015 UTC,Makes sense given the list makes no sense at all
BobsBurgers,3a3uy4,Donutsndrums,5,Wed Jun 17 06:47:27 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Way back when I was a 20 year old college student in Michigan I didn't know anything either.

BobsBurgers,3a3uy4,courtachino,9,Wed Jun 17 13:57:52 2015 UTC,Crawl Space is what got me into show. My favorite episode!

BobsBurgers,3a3uy4,rexpotato,8,Wed Jun 17 03:59:22 2015 UTC,The Frond Files is ranked #86?!?  With The Fart Song?!?  Scandalous.
BobsBurgers,3a3uy4,PorkyBodine,2,Wed Jun 17 12:02:23 2015 UTC,"The Fart Song is very, very funny but other than that and the very final part where Gene and Tina are busting Louise's chops over the brownie chair surprise (a terrific bit) it is not one of my favorites."
BobsBurgers,3a3uy4,airmancoop44,6,Wed Jun 17 20:44:20 2015 UTC,"For those wondering, this is just Part 1 of his rankings, #88-67.   And for what it's worth, his criteria is a little wonky. He seems to dock points if an episode has similar elements to a previous episode, which in my opinion isn't right. Just because an earlier episode deals with a specific plot point doesn't meant a later episode can't do it better."

BobsBurgers,3a3dqa,posananer,13,Tue Jun 16 22:25:56 2015 UTC,"I recently bought and read the first 5 comics. I've enjoyed them all and I recommend them to anyone that likes watching the show.   Tina's segments are based on her Erotic Friend Fictions. Bob's segments are ""Burger of the Day"" ideas. Louise's segments are about the Belcher kids' adventures. Linda's segments are her writing out to different companies. Gene's segments are all musical-like.   I've had a good laugh at every segment in every comic but it's kind of tough to read through Gene's segment since it's all sing-songy."

BobsBurgers,39vo3h,joffyjj,11,Mon Jun 15 11:21:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly. It's easy to get separated at big festivals and cell phone service gets spotty with that many people in one place."

That's good enough reason for me, at least.   ""It's to help my friends locate one anot-"" Shutup. That's a terrible and selfish reason."
BobsBurgers,39vo3h,L4UGH,3,Mon Jun 15 15:22:04 2015 UTC,"The friend thing is a shitty explanation. If it's truly for locating their friends then they should only hoist them up in the BACK of the crowd so their friends don't have to push through people to get to them, and they should put them down when their group is back together. When the people are holding them up and dancing with them for hours at a time in front of people, that shitty excuse goes out the window."

He draws a lot of very questionable things of young characters like Mabel Pines from Gravity Falls- a character based on the creator's sister as a child- and he has drawn outright porn of child characters from The Amazing World of Gumball, who are voice acted by actual children. People can say whatever they want about certain things being okay if they're in fiction or whatever, but characters that are based on real kids or voiced by real kids shouldn't be fap fodder and everyone should agree on that. Mike Inel is gross. Downvote."

That's not to say his DA and Tumblr are pristine, either, since they're obviously full of little girl characters posed seductively.  Love these downvotes, wonder who the local pedo apologists are?

BobsBurgers,39cg31,hakershor,30,Wed Jun 10 20:50:05 2015 UTC,"Is this a joke?  I don't get it.  Kudos on managing to use some form of the word ""pervert"" 11 times in your post, though."
BobsBurgers,39cg31,mxt920,32,Wed Jun 10 20:52:17 2015 UTC,"It's sexist to try and say girls are necessarily less sexual. Society definitely conditions women to be more ashamed of their sexuality. One of the things that makes Tina great is how she's unashamed of her female sexuality, and her own personal sexual expression, when in the real world society tries to make both of those qualities a punchline or demonize them. In the world of the show it is also clearly not a big problem or considered particularly unacceptable.  I could understand finding the focus on ""butts"" with her being overplayed. Rarely is it that the butt humor or the zombie humor have done it for me, it's other moments and parts of her character that are by far my favorites (her panicking, her ""everything is okay face,"" etc.) But of course, humor is always subjective and I don't think a lack of comedic value in this aspect of Tina is really what you're getting at with your complaint.  I would say there could be something to criticize in the fact she writes erotic fiction of people without their consent, but in-universe this is demonstrated to be something that people are mildly put off by at worst, and have a positive outlook towards at best- most notably, the primary subject of her attraction, Jimmy Jr., doesn't have a problem with the fiction and thinks ""it's cool."" Tammy also expressed enjoyment of her works. For these reasons, I think by the law of the show's universe, again, this is meant to be interpreted as a silly and unproblematic facet of her character, though of course in real life that would not be the case.  When you say boys ""are the ones who think like [perverts],"" it frames your entire argument in a bit of a bizarre light, as if it would be more acceptable if Tina were a boy, and that it's offensive that there's a female who is as ""perverse"" as Tina. Both of those sentiments are bad outlooks to have- boys shouldn't have more levity for theoretical wrongdoing, and women shouldn't be shamed for doing what is socially expected of men.  Tina's had the obligation of helping the restaurant at a young age, she's struggled with low grades in school, her ""self-esteem was gradually broken down over the course of years"" by Louise, and considering the simple fact that some teens are just obsessed with their relationships, I don't think it's hard to understand Tina being as enthusiastic about guys as she is. As strong and sensual of a woman she may be, there's comfort in the fantasy of someone who could support her- not by way of fixing or saving her but more having someone to appreciate her for who she is. And even if it's not actually the most important thing in the world, it's something for her to fixate on to blow off steam or enjoy herself.  Speaking as someone who spent their teenage years lonely and feeling unloved, I can sympathize with where Tina comes from in her enthusiasm, really. It's kind of expected to constantly day dream about or want a relationship if you're in that kind of situation, it's what you want, and you never really get it."
BobsBurgers,39cg31,Lazymoth,6,Thu Jun 11 01:29:06 2015 UTC,"This. All of it. I love that Tina isn't held to the normal sitcom binary that states that the teen boys are the horny ones, not the teen girls.  I'd also like to point out that though Tina likes butts and spends a lot of time writing her erotic friend fiction, she has never inappropriately touched someone's butt. And she very rarely, if ever, says lewd things to the other characters about their butts. As far as I'm concerned, this is totally fine."
BobsBurgers,39cg31,SaffirNSimpsonUnite,20,Tue Jun 16 17:11:29 2015 UTC,Why are you so obsessed with and upset by this? Do you have anything you'd like to get off your chest? We're all human.
BobsBurgers,39cg31,SandJA1,-26,Wed Jun 10 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"Any person whose main interest is ogling body parts sexually and this is their main topic of conversation IS A PERVERT. If you met someone in real life who only talked about womens' boobs and butts and how he'd like to squeeze and slobber and rub his dick and jizz all over them, and this was the main thing he talked about, you would think he's a pervert. Because he IS. So Tina doing this shit is fucking perverted and I have no idea why they made a character such a fucking pervert for this show."

BobsBurgers,3900fp,crashboom,6,Mon Jun 8 17:07:54 2015 UTC,For the sake of story telling and what makes the show great is how each of them play in to eachother.

Edit: except for Genes music bits that's all he's good for.
BobsBurgers,3900fp,Lifelikeahobo,6,Mon Jun 8 22:15:41 2015 UTC,"I see it as:  1: The immediate family. I prefer some over others (Louise is my fave), but, I see them more as a complex, but single, unit.  2: Teddy, as his innocence allows him to ask questions that give the family some funny quips or make them question some basic parts of their situations they wouldn't think to ask themselves.  3, 4: A tie between Jimmy Pesto and Mr. Fishoeder. Pesto is a competing restauranteur that has a personal vendetta with Bob, to the point that he'd use his son and hurt Tina, just to blackmail Bob. But, Mr. Fishoeder, being Bob's landlord is also ""above"" Bob in the owner/worker relationship. So, in a way they are partnered, but, Mr. Fish still poses a threat. Shows the complexity of angles Bob could be put out of business, which plays into his stress.  5 to beyond: Depends on the episode."

Whereas the show family guys uses cut aways, and american dad uses rodger, bobs burgers uses gene to keep a constant comic flow.  There are rarely any gene episodes because of this.  I can think of the baseball mascot episode.  The baseball camp episode.  The episode where he had a girlfriend...that's it?"
BobsBurgers,3900fp,hakershor,-4,Wed Jun 10 21:40:17 2015 UTC,Tina is a shit character and it was funny in the first season when they made her boringness into a joke but doing that ended up making her just a terrible character with no personality and not interesting at all.

He probably barely gets 10 customers a day, not including Mort and Teddy. He sunk $3000 into a commercial where he emptied his entire life savings, then as a return got 3 customers to come over from Pesto's. THREE. That should have put him out of business right there and his family would have been living on welfare because his entire life savings is now gone and he made like 15 bucks back from the 3 customers. How the hell does this guy stay in business at all? It's not fucking realistic."
BobsBurgers,38q5g4,hakershor,12,Sat Jun 6 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"They don't show every second of every day. I'm sure you can imagine they might have a few more customers at dinner. And they're always doing extra things to drum up business (dinner theater, ""human meat"" for adventurous eaters, when Torpedo Jones brought a bunch of customers, food trucking- this one seemed to give them lots of business). Not every day is going to be one of these days with tons of customers but it evens out alright I think. It is certainly in the realm of possibility!"
BobsBurgers,38q5g4,triivium,1 point,Sat Jun 6 03:49:18 2015 UTC,"Yes I was thinking about how Torpedo Jones as well as Hey Good Cookin' and their popularity drummed up extra business for the restaurant. But then there's the Sandy Frye commercial for $3000 and getting back 3 customers, and sinking 2/3 childrens' college funds into a food truck and making nothing from it because the check was ripped in half because of running from an angry mob. Bob still should be in tons of debt and unable to make rent to Fischoeder."
BobsBurgers,38q5g4,asiangun,2,Sat Jun 6 03:57:46 2015 UTC,"They did ""make nothing"" from the food truck. Their check was torn but they get to keep the money from the customers. When they had a food truck they always had a line. They didn't get the contest winnings but they still get to keep the customer money from when they were outside their restaurant. The food truck festival or whatever was only one day. Lets just say they broke even on that one since the food truck exploded. Like I said, they don't show every single day of their life. There might be days where they might have more customers.     As for the commercial, it's true that they had 3 extra customers by the end of the day, but I don't think you understand how commercials work. They play and people see it. 99% of them are not going to leave their couch immediately and go eat from that restaurant. They might remember the commercial a few days later when they're craving a burger or something. Even if the commercial was specifically targeted towards that day, people can still remember the ad and come by at a different day.     Some days they don't make much, some days they make a good amount. That's how all businesses are."

BobsBurgers,38nntj,messengerofevil,-3,Tue Jun 9 21:38:19 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing: the tradition in animated television is all little boy characters are voiced by women. Bart Simpson, Tommy Pickles, you name it. It's because women can do the ""boy voice"" better than any male voice actor could. Now Bob's Burgers comes in and completely reverses that trend. Not only is an adult female voiced by a man, but a female child is as well. AND the majority of the female minor characters (Gretchen, Jocelyn) are also voiced by men. The second I heard that the voice actors were clearly men I started laughing and keep thinking ""lol it's a man."" this is because I had the prior knowledge of cartoon boys being almost exclusively voiced by women and it's HILARIOUS to me to see/hear that entirely reversed. So just think about it that way."

His restaurant has live entertainment, HDTV's, generally more glitz, and more effective promotions.  Bob is a good cook but has terrible business sense.  Bob is constantly squandering money on useless stuff like RC helicopters and love testing machines.  Bob's restaurant is a hole in the wall with a weird bathroom.  Plus Hugo is always trying to sabotage Bob.  It's less attractive to casual passersby.  You'd think he'd have a bigger following than Mort/Teddy/Gretchen/etc. by now, though.  I think there's a lot of subtext that the reason for Jimmy's side of the rivalry/peeing-race is that he's jealous of Bob because Bob is passionate about cooking and wants to serve his customers good food, while Jimmy is basically just a salesman peddling a product to make money."

Louise wanted to have Andy and Ollie paint cheap touristy crap to sell, there was that one episode where all the sailors came to the restaurant, Linda's bed and breakfast venture...   Jimmy has good promotions and business sense, his restaurant looks more attractive to the average passerby. Bob's menu is just like a burger and then the special of the day.

If people don't go into Bob's that first time, they never know how good his burgers are. Plus, a pizzeria with lots of options is likely to draw more people than a burger place, that just does burgers and fries.  I find that this situation is often true in real life.

In episode 2F09 when Itchy plays Scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone, he strikes the same rib twice in succession, yet he produces two clearly different tones. I mean, what are we to believe, that this is some sort of a magic xylophone or something? Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder."

BobsBurgers,3814um,Guy_Gerricault,13,Mon Jun 1 02:40:53 2015 UTC,Well 2 parter for me 1. i wanna see pocket sized rudy and not just his hand. 2. I want origin story on roller skating  guy. He never  has more than a spedo on. Where are his clothes? Does he not get cold? Does he not know he is out of shape or just accepted it as ok. Is the roller skating  an attachment thing like lousie and her ears? He is always around almost every episode especially the pier and ESPECIALLY  the kids. Hey may be  a pedo or he may have odd timing and a goal to skate  off the pounds  either way i want to know what he does in his non skating time. Does he have  an at home spedo? How much weed does he smoke? What did he think about the nude beach? Does he live alone? Is he straight? There are so many questions i need answered!
BobsBurgers,3814um,blackbasset,6,Mon Jun 1 03:31:06 2015 UTC,"The questions about Roller Skating Guy are both interesting and in desperate need of answering. I know he wore some stuff in addition to his speedo. There was a scarf one time when it was cold and there was a witch hat on Halloween when he was a witch. He also stopped drinking for a while (Lindapendient Woman) and then drank home brew at Bob's (Speakeasy Rider). He, like Marshmallow, is a rich character that I'd love to know more about."
BobsBurgers,3814um,JaclynMeOff,6,Mon Jun 1 04:27:37 2015 UTC,"But isn't that the beauty of those characters? I'd love to know more about Marshmallow and Speedo Guy, but I think they'd lose a lot of their appeal if they had their background explained. In the world of Bobs Burgers, they might be a bit weird, but accepted and nothing too much out of the ordinary, so they don't need any explaining. I liked the Fishoeder-centric episodes around his house (Thanksgiving Proposal and Oeder Games) a lot, but he might have been even more interesting if he just showed up on his golf cart from time to time."

BobsBurgers,37swmj,JustCallMeAlex,18,Sat May 30 03:09:53 2015 UTC,Crawl Space was the one that got me hooked on it because of bob's moments with kuchi kopi and the video camera
BobsBurgers,37swmj,scottsavestheday,5,Sat May 30 03:24:44 2015 UTC,"I really liked Crawl Space too, huge The Shining fan and loved the homage to what was an amazing film. I think that episode goes under the radar a bit with younger audience members but the references in that episode were incredible. Not too subtle where you're not sure if they're making a reference or not, but not too in your face and over-active that it makes you think ""We get it, you saw the movie!"". Would be a good contender for me, but it doesn't have a song. Gotta have a song!"
BobsBurgers,37swmj,FlaccidTits,14,Sat May 30 03:35:10 2015 UTC,"I have to say that the pilot is my favorite episode. I remember the first time I watched it and it made me laugh so much. After it was over, I turned to my sister and said that I hope this show does well because I have fallen in love. The part that got me laughing with tears in my eyes was when Gene was told to give the burger to the guy who looked like a child molester because heavy kids don't get molested."

I loved that part with Gene as well, I think he makes any situation funny. It's cool that you knew after the pilot this was your show though, wish I was that decisive."
BobsBurgers,37swmj,armndmartinez,2,Sat May 30 14:57:06 2015 UTC,I guess for me it was how unique the show was. The art style is fun and so 'cartoony' which I love. It's funny for adults without be crude. It just makes me happy.
BobsBurgers,37swmj,scottsavestheday,2,Sat May 30 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"The art style reminds me a lot of Home Movies. It's a good show for everyone really, and really the perfect show to make a bad day good. Or a good day better really."

I really liked the show before, but that one scene where Gene is trying to remember the name of the restaurant while Bob yells in the distance is the best scene ever.

BobsBurgers,37swmj,Pheebalicious,4,Wed Jun 3 05:23:39 2015 UTC,"Mine was ""The Kids Rob a Train"". I had watched, maybe, one or two episodes before and I wasn't really invested. I have no idea why in particular that one just got me. It was 1 AM and I finally let my guard down enough to see how funny the show is. Regular Sized Rudy is the bomb!  I think it's super interesting how your favorite relationship is Gene and Louise, because it's one of the relationships I don't think they have a ton of episodes exploring as a main focus! If you wanna, could you give some examples of awesome interactions between Gene and Louise?"
BobsBurgers,37swmj,Flamekebab,2,Sat May 30 17:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah sure, thanks for asking by the way! So one I love is Beefsquatch when Louise is helping Gene and Bob sabotage each other. Gene does this hilarious caw noise to get Louise in his dressing room and than he tells the story about how he 'accidentally' glued his remote control helicopter to his wiener. And Louise goes ""Accidently on purpose"" and than they high five.  It's usually the little moments between the two I love though, the way they play off each other. It just seems to me they have much deeper understand than Gene and Tina or Louise and Tina. Like in The Unbearable Like-Likeness of Gene, Louise (and Bob) are really the only ones seemingly interested in getting Gene to break up with Courtney...because they want Gene to be happy. Or if you notice in Louise's story in the Frond Files, Gene is the first Belcher she runs into and her depiction of Gene is much more detailed and refined than her brief and quite frankly mean interpretations of Tina.   There's way more between the two that I love I just can't think of much else of the top of my head. I love the Kids Rob a Train though...Reg sized Rudy does rock. And as someone with a bean bag friend I appreciated Rudy in that episode a lot."
BobsBurgers,37swmj,Eddie_Chester,2,Sat May 30 17:16:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the answer!! I won't lie, I've never taken the time to analyze Louise and Gene's relationship, but just mentioning a few scenes really highlights how close their relationship is and how natural it feels for them to hang out and have fun with each other. I just thought of the scene where Tina decides to stay with Bob instead of going with Gene and Louise to poke a dead seal (Sexy Dance Fighting maybe?) and Louise basically says, ""See ya, sucker!"" and runs off with Gene to have a blast. I always figured it was because they were younger/closer in age, and I was really afraid that, when I was first introduced to the characters, Gene would just be some mook that Louise pawned around in her schemes. I'm so so so glad they have this amazing bond instead! It makes me want to watch a bunch of them again, I didn't even catch the Frond Files one!!  One of my favorite things about Bob's Burgers is that this stuff happens, this amazing bonding, right under your nose and it's handled so amazingly and done so naturally you just know it. I feel like that's really hard to pull off without having a ""we're bonding"" aesop, and it just makes me love the show even more. Thanks so much for the examples, I will totally look out for it now!!  Also, glad they got some bean-bag-friend representation in media these days, I'll hug mine a little tighter before I go to sleep tonight."
BobsBurgers,37swmj,Sr_Laowai,2,Sat May 30 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"The Frond Files is an amazing episode...I had to watch that episode twice to try and catch all the references and easter eggs and I'm sure I missed a ton.   You really highlighted what I love about the show, how natural the relationships feel. I think that's a good way of putting Gene and Louise's relationship, it's the most natural in the show to me. Even when they're fighting it feels so normal like a spat between siblings should be while also adding the hilarity of Bob's Burgers. I think a good example would be the Dr. Yap episode where they're fighting over the jawbreaker...the contests they come up with and the fun they have competing for the jawbreaker is so real that it reminds me of similar things me and my brothers competed over as kids. Who gets to be player 1 was always the most violent..."
BobsBurgers,37swmj,ToxSeed,3,Sat May 30 17:49:30 2015 UTC,"Crawl space, when Bob starts crying with the video camera on. But my favorite episode has to be Tinas birthday parry, where she tells Bob what she wants I want a boy/girl party hmm And I want dancing and a fog machine mmm no that whole part makes me laugh so hard, I just love Bobs reactions to everything Tina says"
BobsBurgers,37swmj,ToxSeed,1 point,Sat May 30 17:05:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, I love that episode as well (both but specifically the Sheesh! Cab Bob) episode. It's great that Bob is so terrified of his daughter becoming a woman, but what I really loved about that episode is the bit with Bob and Fishoeder standing in the fog. Fishoeder's line about loving the way the fog feels under his cape always make me laugh hysterically. Just the way he delivers the line is so funny to me."

BobsBurgers,36o9mb,skinkbaa,48,Wed May 20 20:55:29 2015 UTC,Switching Tina's gender was the smartest move this show made.
BobsBurgers,36o9mb,tobascodagama,11,Thu May 21 13:41:08 2015 UTC,Pretty sure that was a network suggestion. We can't say Fox is all bad.
BobsBurgers,36o9mb,MBMM1,8,Thu May 21 14:50:50 2015 UTC,"They changed her sex, but i feel a male Tina would essentially be the same gender."

BobsBurgers,36o9mb,Freddie_AppsHero,8,Thu May 21 14:39:21 2015 UTC,They probably went through a lot of iterations with the kids because it doesn't change their characters that much based on gender
BobsBurgers,36o9mb,unaspirateur,4,Thu May 21 05:52:58 2015 UTC,I think Gene is not sure about that either
BobsBurgers,36o9mb,volv0plz,3,Thu May 21 14:34:43 2015 UTC,I assumed that those were alternative Tinas.

I think it would be interesting since Tina is the first cartoon teenage character that I can actually see as awkward without being ""hot when she takes her glasses off"" fake awkward. I'd love to see what direction they would take Tim.   *not Tim, his name was Daniel"

BobsBurgers,36o9mb,CaptainPedge,1 point,Fri May 22 00:23:29 2015 UTC,The character is just so much more memorable as a girl. I feel like girls need a character thats imperfect and weird but still unconditionally loved by her family so they know what they deserve in life. Boys have plenty of characters like that in the media.

Although the end result doesn't make up for how dumb Gene was. Didn't make me like him any more at all. The exterminator in the opening (Abra-ca-dead-bug) was great and Hawk was amazing. ""I love it too!"" ""AHHH!""   Totally made sense that Louise got disproportionately angry at Yuki (aside from the fact that she's an idiot. IDIOT!)  The names don't match, but it would have been so awesome if the voice actors were related too."

BobsBurgers,35nqc0,archpope,5,Tue May 12 08:18:24 2015 UTC,"To delve a little deeper into this subject, the one canon height we know of the characters is Mickey, who is 6'2"". https://instagram.com/p/1JdNrOIgQ8/  Going off of that, Tina couldn't be quite 5'5"". By calculations I did comparing other characters to Mickey, I got 3'4"" for Louise, 4'4"" for Tina, 4'8"" for Jimmy Jr. and 5'4"" for Mr. Frond. These numbers might sound a little small, but considering everyone is generally quite shorter than Mickey, I don't think they seem that inaccurate. Also, if Tina were 5'5"" that would put Frond at 6'7"" or so (and he would clearly have less confidence issues if this were the case.) I think Frond being 5'4"" seems like a pretty good measurement as his height is below average compared to other adult males in the show.  Although, it should be mentioned that size comparisons in the cartoon itself aren't totally airtight from frame to frame, they fluctuate a bit- for example in some parts of Ambergris, Tina is clearly much too tall. I consistently got the heights listed above in a few different shots when I was doing calculations, and they are also based on official turnaround images, so they're the ones I stick with."
BobsBurgers,35nqc0,Lazymoth,1 point,Tue May 12 10:09:43 2015 UTC,"If it is to be assumed this Tina is life-sized, and 53"" translates to 4'4"", your guesstimates of the characters' heights is totally accurate.

BobsBurgers,35l7ka,JonSchwarz23,26,Mon May 11 12:21:13 2015 UTC,"I love Gene as a character, so I've been thinking about this quite a bit.  Stating something like ""an 11 year old boy with no external teaching only knows three chords"" is not implausible at all. Even though Gene obviously loves music and loves to play it, without external teaching (and the ever essential focus and hard work!) it's difficult to pick up anything solid from a technical standpoint. The trouble comes with the fact that we know that he's capable of playing more than three chords because he's done it so well in other episodes like with the amazing Electric Love. Even Bob in the episode says with surprise and impressed inflection, ""Did Gene write this?"" as Electric Love is being performed.  I think that while Gene has a (unconfirmed degree of but present) natural talent + love for performing music, he just doesn't have the discipline, and therefore his previous hits were more based on random bursts of creativity that stem from that natural affinity and not knowledge about music in general. It's certainly possible to draw something beautiful without any knowledge of why you are able to do so, simply by paying attention (passion) and performing (natural talent + repetitiveness). However, if one doesn't hone this craft, it's incredibly difficult to describe how you decided to make your piece to others because you are unsure of how you have done it yourself. While being unable to describe your piece is accepted in the art world, in the music world (at least the realm of music that Gene is interested in) is not so kind for one reason: the need for cooperation.  Gene doesn't want to go solo, he wants to have or be the lead of a group. This is supported in SEVERAL episodes, (he even demonizes going solo in The Gayle Tales!) and the only exceptions I can think of is when he is on his own and sharing small, randomly produced songs with his family or friends. It's almost never treated as a performance of something he's spent a lot of time on, but more as a ADHD-esque ""look what I just came up with!"" that Gene is so known for. It's his excitement for arriving at new conclusions on what he can do with his beloved keyboard (and fart noises!) rather than a careful collection of skill like a concert. Gene is rarely seen acting alone, and is in some episodes making excuses to interact with the rest of the family rather than be alone. Gene values music, but he values having fun with people that he cares about and who care about him just as much...and he's certainly not ready/old enough to come to the conclusion that he may have to choose between those two things to focus on music in order to improve his musical ability. (The only exception I can think of is his One Gene Show, but I'll come back to why I think it's still justified.) That's why it's treated as such a big deal in this episode when it didn't seem to be an issue before.  Music has a language because you need to be able to communicate your ideas with others to collaborate.  Gene doesn't care to focus enough to understand that language (doesn't want to spend time learning piano, doesn't want to learn more than the three letter chords he knows) but he needs to in order to collaborate with others, to have the musical future that he really wants. It's obvious he wants fame, but he doesn't want to go it alone. He associated people = fun and music = fun, and what he really wants is the fun. But this episode highlights the age old concept that even a genius' talent is wasted if it's never honed, and in this unique case, if that individual is unable to work with others to communicate a common goal (being able to read + understand music in order to have more than him play it) than they are unable to not only work with the group, but to get them on the same boat. What I believe Gene's perspective is may be that same feeling when one is placed in a group of one's peers that they feel they are superior to intellectually or in ability, but are too exhausted to explain why they are wrong over and over. In this situation, Gene feels like it's much easier to take over the operation and order people around, because he is unable to use the language of music to quantify and share his musical affinity. He feels like he is like a naturally-talented artist with no prior experience that is instructed to teach people with zero natural-talent. How do you express shading, perspective, and the rule-of-thirds without the words for these things? But what is actually happening is that he has a minor inflated ego and no leadership abilities AND he still doesn't know the language. And the people around him do have talent (or at least in most of them, focus on learning) that is expressed in a way that is foreign to him. So it's also a case of skewed perspectives when it comes to perceived musical talent on both sides.  I'm confident that Gene DOES know more than 3 chords, but they aren't ""chords"" to him. They're ""music that just sounds good for whatever reason"" to him. ""Chords"" is a technical term to Gene, something he does not associate with fun, and therefore not with making music. He doesn't know how to quantify and align what are clearly different, good sounding chords to others. I feel like this was highlighted in the episode in his little imagine spot with his keyboard in ""I Don't Need Music Anymore"". Making music comes so easily and feels so great to him, and behind him are examples of chords that are clearly not the three he claims to know how to play! But Gene isn't facing the back where the chords are...he's looking down on the keys. He doesn't know the language, he knows what he sees in front of him, and what he feels is right. The inclusion of that small burst of musical creativity was a reminder that Gene still CAN make good music and that the episode wasn't meant to be out of character.  Of course, the problem with this seems to be in ""Live Hard or Die Trying, Girl!"" when Gene is more than happy to fire the cast and perform the music himself for my ""Gene likes people because people = fun"" theory. It's stated right away that Die Hard: The Musical is a passion project that has been in the works for a long time, and was likely (in Gene's mind) not going to be performed for real until he has his perfect cast. As I highlighted before, Gene likes having fun! And watching his musical baby get mutilated by a bunch of kids that don't know what he's thinking (an inability to use language, to communicate! See the connection?) is enough for his ego to push him over the edge. Also, the moral ends up telling us that he is willing to give up his ego to allow others to perform music and to work with other people to perform music.  Another plausible theory and possible thing playing into this (which may be more accurate...) is that it's not really about Gene's seemingly random inability to make good music. It's just about the needs of the episode and the Bob's Burgers world. Bob's Burgers is really dedicated to keeping stuff tied to reality, in comparison to shows like Family Guy. While it's funny for Peter in Family Guy to burst into flames for a punchline, an unexplained event like that would never fly in Bob's Burgers because it's so rooted in reality. Bob's usually gets around this with things like hallucinations, dreams, and the infamous Belcher family trait of talking to inanimate objects, but in only one area does Bob's allow itself to deviate into a little madness: musical numbers. A lot of the time when something is being sung, reality seems to be able to warp a little. So the inclusion of music as a major theme gave the writers a little more wiggle room because we are able to suspend a bit more of our disbelief when they're going on, so it became just that much more plausible for Gene to suddenly be bad at music.  TL;DR Gene is able to make stuff like ""Electric Love"" because he has a natural talent, but this episode is about why not being able to focus enough to learn the language of music + ego hurts his ability to collaborate (which is what he mostly wants to focus on because it's fun) and stunts his ability to work with others in a professional sense (which is what he wants to do eventually). He knows more than three chords but he can't express that. Also, reality gets stretched in the Belcher's world when music is involved. Also a lot of theories about Gene and music in general. Sorry. Gene gets me excited. But basically what still-improving said but longer and fleshed out.  Edit: Also wacky stuff in the world of Bob's Burgs is also done thanks to almost every other adult being insane and because of wacky coincidences. It's never really addressed anywhere but a ton of the adults that the Belchers interact with are crazy enough that if a random adult is helpful/nice to them it's rare!"

BobsBurgers,35jfnv,addisonavenue,25,Mon May 11 03:12:34 2015 UTC,"This was easily the best episode since The Gayle Tales, and quite possibly, one of the best the show has ever produced. There wasn't an element out of place and even the twist ending elevated everything.  I think what I loved the most was that this episode initially presents itself like a simple ""Keeping up with Jones'"" premise, and from the moment Linda wraps her arm around Bob as they stare at the ocean you feel that's where the story is heading. That the Goodwins will come home early, and the Belchers will spend the next 30 mins tiptoeing from room to room, trying (and undoubtedly failing) to avoid detecting in order to save Teddy a job. While the expected wry comparisons between their socioeconomic levels and that of their unwitting hosts were there, instead, we get a left field murder mystery with Louise and Linda doing their best Hart to Hart to outwit Helen. And oh, Helen. What a performance. This was a spectacular reading, start to finish, a character completely at peace with the world of the show. As dangerous as we can only infer she is, I really hope we see her again.  All in all, this was the perfect mixture of surreal, relatable and adorable that a good Bob's episode should be."
BobsBurgers,35jfnv,blackbasset,9,Mon May 11 09:17:19 2015 UTC,"As dangerous as we can only infer she is, I really hope we see her again.   She should get regular appearances, as Teddys fiancé or something. Maybe for a double header season finale with a marriage? Linda tries to save Teddy from marrying her, but Bob is fine with it since she would not kill Teddy cause there's no gold to dig.... or something"
BobsBurgers,35jfnv,kosherkitties,44,Tue May 12 07:08:05 2015 UTC,"Super creepy and awesome. Can't stop thinking about it.   It's interesting to see Louise and Linda bonding, which is pretty rare to this extent, I think? Also really enjoy Bob on painkillers. ""Henry."" ""Helen."" ""No I'm Bob.""  I truly wonder if he will forget. Maybe she did lie about her having to drag him to climb all the mountains?"
BobsBurgers,35jfnv,hipsterhijabi,10,Mon May 11 05:21:06 2015 UTC,I think Linda is a really amazing character. She has three very different kids and she initially comes off as a bit of an idiot. But she's really loveable and protective and a REALLY REALLY good mom!   She relates to all of them so well.   I love it. Best TV mum and dad eva
BobsBurgers,35jfnv,anteater97,42,Wed May 13 04:40:05 2015 UTC,"That was pretty good. Loopy Bob was the best, and Helen was a really good character. She actually had me fooled for a minute! I'm excited to see more of her in the future. Also, glad Teddy's finally found love! I'll be happy to see how that develops as well."
BobsBurgers,35jfnv,fishnbrewis,38,Mon May 11 02:09:28 2015 UTC,Hopefully it doesn't get abandoned like the Mort and lady mortician (forget her name) storyline from Weekend at Mort's.  Teddy really deserves a love interest. I love how much his character in particular has grown since his earliest episodes.

I just adore how they make it seem so...so implausible, with Linda going off on a crazy tangent at the beginning with no base, and then...it just weaves it so well, that at first you agree with Bob and think there's no way, then you can't tell, then you're flip flopping all over the place! Wonderful suspense, and Linda called it! Maybe she retained some of those ""psychic powers"" after all, huh?"

The Simpsons are in their 400 millionth season and they haven't had an explanation of what ambergris is. South Park is in it's 397 millionth season and they haven't either...  And still, like I said, it's not like they haven't seen that episode of Futurama, so it's bit was absolutely in their minds as they did it."

I would have thought record companies would have jumped on this years ago.  There are so many shows with GREAT music.   I shouldn't have to hold up my phone to the TV screen and use SoundHound to find a song title.

BobsBurgers,34ttyx,Sveenee,92,Mon May 4 14:44:00 2015 UTC,"I always thought it was pretty clear that Jimmy is jealous of Bob's integrity as a chef. The relationship thing is an interesting point, though. I think Jimmy is very self-conscious about his image and being ""normal"". He has a bully's instinct for hating what's different than him. Problem is, his kids are weirdos, too. So he is distant towards them but outright mean to Bob because Bob and the ther Belchers are ""fair game"" in his eyes."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,theworldbystorm,8,Mon May 4 17:49:30 2015 UTC,integrity as a chef   Is Jimmy even a chef? I'm trying to think of a time that it's been said that he is but I'm now thinking he's just a restaurant owner?
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,Campbellsoupcan,13,Mon May 4 22:19:13 2015 UTC,"There was an episode where they have a cook off and Jimmy makes a burger with ""just a ton of Oregano.""  And it's gross."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,arcadiafalls,1 point,Tue May 5 00:08:52 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of when he started serving burgers too and had one late at night and hated it so much he threw it out after two bites. I had assumed that Jimmy had made that and was mostly angry at how much his cooking sucks. I wouldn't be surprised if Jimmy had people order take out from Bob for him so he could enjoy Bob's burgers without letting Bob know. Kinda like Teddy did when Bob cut him off, But Jimmy isn't dumb enough to eat in Bob's restroom."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,MadMan2012,6,Tue May 5 11:45:01 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting question. I think Jimmy Pesto is in charge of his kitchen, making him, in name only, a chef. However, I also am sure that he has more staff than just Trev and that they do most of the cooking. Furthermore, I think the ""cooking"" being done at Jimmy Pesto's is mostly just microwaving stuff and putting it under heat lamps."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,theworldbystorm,11,Mon May 4 22:28:05 2015 UTC,pretty much agree. I think it's mentioned quite a few times that Jimmy re-heats food or uses packaged/pre bought stuff. I think he doesn't like that Bob takes pride in his work and makes something different every day.
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,fannyfresh,5,Mon May 4 18:22:29 2015 UTC,"It's my passion, dad! PASSION!"
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,blamb211,25,Mon May 4 20:46:48 2015 UTC,I think the biggest problem between the two of them would be direct proximity. Being across the street makes a direct impact on bobs customers and vice versa. The fact that Jimmy seems to be almost the polar opposite of bob in every aspect kind of cements the rivalry.
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,Guy_Gerricault,22,Mon May 4 17:52:12 2015 UTC,"I guess I always just figured it was because Jimmy is an asshole. Not much deep seated, complex, underlying sentiment. Jimmy is the kind of guy who pretends to be Italian to sell an easy, widely popular food that attracts crowds for sporting events. Every person I've met that operates this kind of establishment, successful or not, has been an asshole."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,timrbrady,10,Mon May 4 20:42:09 2015 UTC,I have thought this too and totally agree.
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,illiterature,4,Mon May 4 15:17:29 2015 UTC,"So...I just started watching this show for the first time 3 days ago, but saw several episodes this past weekend.  Is Jimmy's wife never mentioned?  What part of the country is this--maybe New Jersey?  I don't think the Belchers are ""WASP-y White,"" so are they a different ethnicity?  I wondered if they might be Italian descent, and if so, does that feed into why Jimmy hates Bob so much?  Maybe both Jimmy's family and Bob's family are Italian descent, but Bob makes authentic burgers and Jimmy makes fake-but-stereotypical Italian food?"
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,Mary_Magdalen,16,Mon May 4 18:53:17 2015 UTC,"It's been hinted that Jimmy is divorced but the wife has never been on the show.  I remember reading an article that theorized that it takes place in Ocean City, New Jersey. Some of the characters have Jersey accents and there was an episode where they visited Linda ' s parents in Florida. They showed a map of the trip to fast forward to the next scene in Florida. The trip started in New Jersey.  There's been jokes about Bob's ethnicity but no one knows if they are Italian or not."

BobsBurgers,34ttyx,maybe1dayy,5,Mon May 4 19:33:58 2015 UTC,"i would guess Linda is italian (based on her accent, which is typical new jersey italian), but it would be so cool if bob ended up being middle eastern or greek or armenian or some other ethnicity that doesnt get enough love on american TV."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,anvilcity,7,Mon May 4 20:41:11 2015 UTC,"Aunt Gayle wore a dress made of shrimp to mass, implying that Linda's family is Roman Catholic; so another point in favor of Linda being Italian-American."

So they are (sort of) from New Jersey."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,EmDancer,3,Mon May 4 20:05:00 2015 UTC,"I've always assumed Linda was Italian, but Bob is said to be ""just swarthy"". It makes sense that Jimmy could be jealous on many levels, including that Bob's family could pull of Italian, and that he has a functioning(ish) family."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,snowflake116,5,Mon May 4 22:58:24 2015 UTC,"I think that Bob and Jimmy are jealous of each other for polar opposite reasons. Jimmy is jealous of Bob's ability to cook and serve ""elevated"" versions of the burger. He's also jealous of Bob's relationship with his wife and kids, the fact that Bob has regulars(mort & teddy) who are more than just customers their friends and go the restaurant not only for the food but for the Beltcher family. Where as Jimmy only has one friend and he works for him and pays that guy.  Conversely Bob is jealous of Pesto's success. He doesn't understand how a restaurant that serves bad food disguised by clever marketing (jimmy is always running some discount special or theme night) can be so successful: especially when his restaurant is across the street! The two are always eying each other up. Trying to see what the other is doing. Bob's jealous of Jimmys burger boss skills or the fact that he cheated at family frakus and not only beat them but won the mini van that the benchers so desperately needed/ had multiple opportunities to win. Or Tina hitting Jimmys Sports car.  Also I think the last name ""Pesto"" has multiple meanings. Not only is it Italian therefore linking Jimmy to Italy and is appropriate for the owner of an Italian ( another marketing gimmick since we know that isn't his real last name )restaurant but Jimmy is also a ""Pest"" to Bob always egging him on and in most cases getting on over on Bob.  But most of the characters on the show have names that pertain to their business I. e. Mort; which can be seen as an abbreviation for mortuary....   The point is while Bob might not have a thriving business he does own a restaurant he is proud of and has family and friends who loves him and his family; ultimately  making his life richer then Jimmys ever could be."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,snowflake116,3,Tue May 5 14:04:10 2015 UTC,"That's some excellent insight!  Maybe that's why Teddy is called Teddy. He's shaped and acts like a teddy bear.  In some cultures, it's polite to burp after eating. Is that why the family is named Belcher? Or is that a stretch?"
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,espeebz,5,Tue May 5 14:55:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think its a stretch. The name Teddy invokes and informs characteristics of ""Teddy"". And I think your point about Belcher works too in addition to it being so close to Burger and also the Belcher family is all about the belching & farting jokes. Gene and Linda can't go 5 min without making some form of joke based on those things.   Dr. Yap, who's a dentist and his name means "" The Mouth""! The list goes on."

BobsBurgers,34ttyx,phantom827,6,Tue May 5 02:55:57 2015 UTC,I always thought it was quite obvious that Bob's jealousy of Jimmy is ironic in nature.
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,MadMan2012,2,Mon May 4 16:01:20 2015 UTC,I've always seen it that while jimmy pesto is successful he's jealous of the fact that bob has such free will to do whatever he wants. Jimmy goes by the rules and thus has a successful but boring job. Bob does what he wants and goes with the flow and while he is just keeping his head above water gets to have all these great adventures which jimmy is jealous of. It's basically the grass is always greener story but from our POV we would all probably rather be on bobs side
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,snowflake116,1 point,Tue May 5 04:48:21 2015 UTC,"We know Bb doesn't have a problem with other restaurant owners, but does Jimmy? We've never seen him with anyone other than his lacky. Maybe it is because Jimmy is just a huge jerk that no one likes and Bob has the bad luck to be across the street from him."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,MadMan2012,2,Tue May 5 11:49:36 2015 UTC,As far I know Bobs only real interaction with the other restaurant owners came when they were all fighting for a common cause. It isn't friendship that brings them together its their mutual disdain for the food critic and their need to rectify in some way the damage he has done to their businesses. Pestos restaurant was either not reviewed or his restaurant is so lucrative and popular that the review whether positive or negative was essentially meaningless. Other then that Bobs interaction with the other restaurant owners has been fleeting. In fact I would argue his children and have continued to interact with them more then he has.   Also remember Bob believes himself to be above them all. Essentially confirming that what the critic wrote in regards to their establishments was essential true. He also managed to piss off an entire online Burger Joint owning community (they viewed his comments as arrogant) and he and Linda were ostracized from their meet up and kicked out of the hotel.  So I'm not sure I buy into Bob being just one of the gang.
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,PorkyBodine,2,Tue May 5 15:38:07 2015 UTC,"Bob wouldn't have much time to get out to hang around with these guys. He is tied to the restaurant nearly 24/7 like most of them so I doubt they do much more than know each other and are friendly. While talking about the moody foody Bob does talk down to them all, but none of them are really upset about it. I figured it was for two reasons, one Bob was telling the truth and two they are actually friends. The kids seem to have a good relationship with them, even on a first name basis with Tina(Louise seems like she'll call anyone by their first name, but I feel Tina would need to be comfortable with them). When they show up at Reggies house at night he has no problem talking to them and giving them information, even showing them his gazebo. Not something I would expect from someone you just vaguely know.   online Burger Joint owning community   They were not owners, they claimed he was a big shot restauranter always bragging about his restaurant, because they are just burger enthusiasts. They hated Bob because he has no idea about online etiquette. From how excited Bob was to see everyone he thought his posts were fun and playful."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,whiskeytango55,1 point,Tue May 5 16:02:48 2015 UTC,"The family aspect of the theory is the more subtle part. The Belchers are, despite obvious flaws, a happy, strong, close kit family. The Pesto's are by contrast not. Not happy, not close knit, and in fact not even Pesto's.  This theory is 100% sound in my opinion. Thanks for articulating it."
BobsBurgers,34ttyx,SayceGards,1 point,Wed May 6 14:18:14 2015 UTC,"Their restaurants are across the street from each other, so there's going to be a degree of rivalry  Bob can be kind of a snooty jerk when it comes to food. Jimmy Pesto's restaurant isn't bad (his burgers aren't that good, but IIRC, Linda liked the food there).  This guy   http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1owlw0/jimmy_pestos_wife_is_dead_he_hates_bob_because/  thinks it's because Mrs. Pesto died giving birth to the twins.

BobsBurgers,34jk07,phil2210,4,Fri May 1 18:18:27 2015 UTC,"I like Tina the most because she's a goofball, but has a weird sort of confidence about herself. She's sexual in a way that I rarely see portrayed on TV as a teen girl, and is completely unapologetic about it. Her parents love and support her weirdness without judgement (most of the time) and she takes risks that would embarrass or cripple a lot of girls her age.  I <3 Tina and am glad there is a person like her that is the antiMeg from Family Guy."
BobsBurgers,34jk07,donnademuertos,-5,Fri May 1 18:48:45 2015 UTC,"I guess the reasons I know most people like Tina are the reasons I do not like her, and thats just different tastes in people.  I think the whole teenage sexuality thing they push with her is very off-putting.  I am really not a fan of her voice or any noises she makes which i think are supposed to be funny? but i think the thing that does it most for me is her uncanny ability to be a total idiot and get the family and/or Bob into some sort of trouble that could have easily been avoided.  It doesnt have to be even the core of the episode which doesss happen (Tina-Rannosuraus Wrecks), it can be a way smaller action (her telling the town meeting that it was her and the kids who knocked the shark tower down) and it just completely throws everyone else under the bus.  Sorry for my rant, I am not trying to put down your opinion on the show I was really wondering what her appeal was and I can see how people can have their likes about her"

BobsBurgers,341he3,EvilSock,35,Mon Apr 27 19:29:15 2015 UTC,DRL would have adblock running
BobsBurgers,341he3,smokey_sunrise,10,Mon Apr 27 20:45:05 2015 UTC,And thus I noticed for the first time that I've been blocking Ads in Reddit since day 1.
BobsBurgers,341he3,ReiBob,10,Mon Apr 27 22:05:44 2015 UTC,reddit has ads? Man never knew hahaha
BobsBurgers,341he3,themenace95,17,Mon Apr 27 22:07:43 2015 UTC,They're a weird kind of not really invasive ads. They even thank you for not using adblock and it doesn't complain about you using it when you do.  Good guy Reddit :')
BobsBurgers,341he3,ReiBob,6,Mon Apr 27 22:10:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah. But  if you disable ADP on Reddit and use RES youtube still plays ads. I wish I could handle that, but it's so maddening. Sorry, Reddit :("

BobsBurgers,341he3,_Choppy,9,Mon Apr 27 16:24:50 2015 UTC,/r/headphones/ maybe? There's no real way to tell.
BobsBurgers,341he3,monmonorama,6,Mon Apr 27 18:17:08 2015 UTC,"Couldn't be /headphones, doesnt look like a big enough circle jerk about the baldoor e100s."
BobsBurgers,341he3,OdinsBeard,-3,Tue Apr 28 00:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people who have hobbies that you don't appreciate are idiots right?   Thanks, came here to see if anyone mentioned /r/headphones and got nut punched by someone taking a cheap shot at a subreddit.   I learned a long time ago to not bad mouth hobbies that I don't appreciate. I've fallen into the category of some of those that constantly get bashed for no damn reason. I personally think spending $5,000 on a gaming PC is silly but do I appreciate the idea of having a super powered PC? Am I jealous or someone running the newest games in 4k at 120fps? You bet your sweet ass I do. Would I spend that much? No.   I might sound pissed but I'm not. Enjoy your hobbies and spread your thoughts and share your interests but please don't insult other people's. That's what reddit is after all. A pile of sub(interests) that come together to complete one freaking awesome website for the most part.   Looking at your post history you seem to be pretty well versed and have a healthy list of interests.   PS: I know you were just making a joke. I just wanted to rant at someone and share some thoughts. :p"

I can't wait till my dt 770s arrive!"
BobsBurgers,341he3,OdinsBeard,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:40:55 2015 UTC,baldoor e100s   I thought those were made up to mock the new 'flavor of the day' headphones. haha Didn't even realize they were an actual thing similar to the Silvania W423's.   I'm currently enjoying my LCD-XC and Schiit Modi2U/Magni2U stack here at work. Been working on a comfort mod for awhile now but think I just settled with a suspension belt with the stock headband. Could just be me but I find the XC's more comfortable than the LCD-2F...
BobsBurgers,341he3,bobguyman,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:50:05 2015 UTC,Daaaang nice cans.    I actually own the e100s.  Surprisingly good sound for $8.  The nonsense started when a guy claimed they were better than $1000 IEMs.
BobsBurgers,341he3,OdinsBeard,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:54:40 2015 UTC,I could never get my ears comfortable wearing earplug types like that. I do much better with in-ear. I recently got a pair of ER4S's and they are freaking incredible. I'm slapping myself for not getting a pair 10 years ago.  But yeah the XC's are definitely end game cans for me. Still trying to settle on one more pair though.. Was hoping the LCD2's would be it but feels like I'm still missing something. Might look into some HD800's now that my ears are more experienced.   These XC's really sing with my Lyr 2 at home better than the stack here at work but I don't want to leave such a nice amp here. Really love the bass on the XC but I like the mids on the 2 better and the treble on the XC has better extension. Luckily I can hear up into the 16-18khz range so I really appreciate headphones that don't cut corners.

It wouldn't take a lot to bring the cartoon back for 12 or so episodes. the entire show is (already written) stand-up jokes and improv + the animation is incredibly simple.  with that said, I could definitely see Dan Mintz on there."

BobsBurgers,33z7ep,Twitchythrowaway,29,Mon Apr 27 03:22:32 2015 UTC,"The inconsistencies in Gene's musical abilities really bothered me. In the episode about Topsy the elephant, he wrote Electric Love, which was fantastic. I don't know if he got somebody to compose the music for him, though. Even if he did, I'm pretty sure he's played some more little short songs.   I did enjoy the episode, though overall it just felt shorter and more rushed than previous episodes."
BobsBurgers,33z7ep,hockeystew,19,Mon Apr 27 05:52:11 2015 UTC,"this bothered me too! he played loads of stuff in Hamburger Dinner Theater, Topsy, the episode with Courtney. I feel like he's a really good musician already.  he's been carrying that keyboard for 5 seasons and he supposedly only knows 3 chords?"
BobsBurgers,33z7ep,Titanosaurus,11,Mon Apr 27 23:21:21 2015 UTC,"Louis Armstrong, one of the greatest trumpet players, could barely read music, and couldn't play in big band. Gene might be the same type."
BobsBurgers,33z7ep,theworldbystorm,16,Tue Apr 28 01:43:44 2015 UTC,You'd be surprised how far a couple chords can get you. It struck me as pretty consistent. Gene can write original stuff but can't transpose between keys. Makes sense to me.

You also gotta remember, the situation surrounding Topsy gave Gene a lot of creative control, something he lacked here, which might've contributed to his breakdown."

BobsBurgers,33z7ep,Eddie_Chester,12,Mon Apr 27 02:14:15 2015 UTC,I think the answer to your first question is that the show is trying to showcase one of each of it's five leads from episode to episode and the kids outnumber the adults three to two.  The answer to your second question is tonight.

It's funny once or twice but after a while it's like the Meg Hate, too mean spirited and even counterproductive to the kids benefits to be funny after a while.  Having the kids get lots of people to Bob's resteaurant would have made for a nice sweet ending.   Part of the show's initial charm is that it would let Bob win every now and then, but it seems like the days of having transvestite hookers saving the day for Bob are long over.

BobsBurgers,33vfpq,holographene,10,Sun Apr 26 01:05:28 2015 UTC,Popcorn Time is a program that has an interface similar to Netflix and a built in media player that downloads the show view a Bitorrent client when its selected. The program uses downloaded and shared files from users similar to other torrenting programs. More info can be found here.
BobsBurgers,33vfpq,mgawheat,13,Sun Apr 26 02:10:50 2015 UTC,A service that spoon feeds torrents to people. Quality is often crap.

Why would he hide that he's sleeping around if he's not still married? And when he tells Andy and Ollie, ""I thought you were with your mom"" it might not have meant in a ""this weekend"" kind of way.   It seems like Jimmy isn't really interested in the kids lives at all, so it wouldn't be too shocking if the mom didn't care much about the family either. She's packed the boys tampons and cat food for lunch before. Maybe not on purpose, but still seems like someone who just throws something in a bag for them and shoos them out of the house."

BobsBurgers,33jz6e,aeoliaa,9,Thu Apr 23 04:57:17 2015 UTC,That is the perfect explanation. And it is so simple I feel kinda dumb for never thinking of it that way :)

BobsBurgers,33jz6e,rhodyrhody,7,Thu Apr 23 21:52:59 2015 UTC,Jimmy also has more money than Bob does so he can afford to do more lavish things and make his restaurant look nicer than Bob's.

BobsBurgers,33jz6e,GreaseGeek,9,Thu Apr 23 18:30:38 2015 UTC,I think that it mostly has to do with Jimmy being a jerk and rubbing his success in Bobs face all the time.  I think Bob would have a live and let live attitude if both businesses were equally successful.

BobsBurgers,338jta,douglife,4,Tue Apr 21 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"Lovely thoughts here, I really enjoyed reading it.  Allow me to add my personal take on it:  First, both Bob and Fischoeder are plagued by a common enemy, location.  You'll notice throughout the series that Bob and Fischoeder are constantly struggling to obtain clientele, while Pesto is doing fine.   This makes sense, especially with the ""Wharf"" location so similar to the currently crumbling Jersey Shore & Atlantic City.  Bob makes great food, but it's not enough these days, and with most of the marketing left up to Gene, he struggles like countless other great chefs in not-so-popular areas.  Pesto does fine simply because he caters to everyone. Pizza, burgers, italian food, he's basically Applebee's.  Fischoeder of course is plagued by his own problems and mismanagement, but as the show goes on you notice he is less and less able to replace Bob's establishment easily.  One person you mentioned without any positives is Tina, and I understand that. However to me, Tina is the glue that holds them together. Sure, Linda keeps them going through the day to day in motherly duties, but Tina is a rock for both Bob & Linda, and the kids as separate entities, which really makes her character so interesting to me.  Hope you like it!"

I'm not trying to make any sort of judgement on it, I think it's cool that people make stuff like this, but what does it have to do with festivals? I've never been able to go to major one but I watch live streams all the time and I see people who make these huge cut out of things from TV Shows and carry them around all day at festivals. Isn't it kind of annoying to carry it around all the time? Aren't you worried about blocking peoples views?   I'm not trying to sound like a jerk or diminish your work, but it's something I see and I just don't understand. Is there is a history at festivals for this kind of thing? Generally what is the motivation to carry around a giant piece of TV fan art at a seemingly unrelated event? Do you want the musicians to know what your favorite shows are? Is it to meet people with similar interests?"

""Tina"" and her objections was just the remainder of Bob's shattered conscience trying to punch thru the denial."
BobsBurgers,33562f,doctorfrankenskein,2,Sun Apr 19 22:43:56 2015 UTC,Interesting. What about when Tina starts the fire? Is that Bobs subconscious creating a split personality that takes on the characteristics and tendencies of Tina and the rest of the family to help him cope with the trauma of his loss? Such as food truck? Was it Bob or the children who created that mess?
BobsBurgers,33562f,cuteintern,2,Mon Apr 20 01:47:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a fight club type of split. Bob's barely holding on; fully delusional.  Pesto's sick of his shit and wants Bob to stop driving customers a way from the wharf."

BobsBurgers,32vd8x,IvyAmethyst,6,Fri Apr 17 01:05:53 2015 UTC,"My favorite is Louise too!  I sometimes try to compare her with Stewie from Family Guy because they're both the most intelligent of their siblings yet they're the youngest and most ""evil"".   But unlike Stewie, Louise's loyalty to her family makes her a very strong character - she just won't tell them head on that she loves them. :) She has always been a daddy's girl, she defends her siblings, and despite that she doesn't share the same interests as Linda, they can also get along great because they both have crazy personalities. I honestly just love seeing Louise's character development unravel! Plus, she still has her childish moments that are super cute."
BobsBurgers,32vd8x,IvyAmethyst,2,Fri Apr 17 10:46:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I mean. Who's everyone's favorite Belcher, Louise is the best Belcher for you."
BobsBurgers,32vd8x,BaymaxandTianaFan,5,Fri Apr 17 01:19:02 2015 UTC,"Yep louise is the best belcher for me, shes rad."
BobsBurgers,32vd8x,BaymaxandTianaFan,2,Fri Apr 17 01:22:13 2015 UTC,She's actually my least favorite of the kids...too self-centered. And it's calculated manipulation too...damn Louise is rad. Still doesn't compare with Tina though!
BobsBurgers,32vd8x,Phishmcz,2,Fri Apr 17 01:25:35 2015 UTC,Ive always liked Louise then Gene then Tina. Still love her but shes just not my fave.
BobsBurgers,32vd8x,kmk1018,2,Fri Apr 17 01:28:05 2015 UTC,"That's how I feel with all the Belchers...me and my roommates just kind of snowballed this argument. For me, Tina has the highest number of positive personality traits and the least amount of negative personality traits...I mean her biggest flaw is liking butts too much, which is not a flaw in my book!"
BobsBurgers,32vd8x,MontezumaIsAfraid,8,Fri Apr 17 01:33:37 2015 UTC,"I would say Linda.  While she is a big over bearing sometimes, Linda tries to be the voice of reason. She also loves all her kids and never does she try to change them. I think what really made me like Linda was in the episode where Upskirt Kirt tries to seduce and she tells him to back off. She may have been bored but she would never cheat on her husband. I also loved how she head butted the dude"
BobsBurgers,32vd8x,vitsikany,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:34:01 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, I like Linda a lot as well. She's my least favorite Belcher though haha. I really like her interactions with the kids as well, especially with Gene. She's probably the most underrated Belcher."

BobsBurgers,32q0d6,BaymaxandTianaFan,21,Wed Apr 15 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"You say it may seem like something tiny, and I agree but I think because there's so many shows where an awkward daughter or an overzealous son would be treated as the butts of every joke instead of real characters, Bob's Burgers really stands out in how it handles its characters.   The Belcher family treat each other like a real family would, in the sense that yeah, you're all weird but you're all weird together... you're working with each other and not against each other. This show wouldn't be nearly as good if it were malicious like Family Guy sometimes is, and that's what I love about it"
BobsBurgers,32q0d6,mxs64,15,Wed Apr 15 20:23:39 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you understand.  Tina and Gene are accepted for who they are. They're never meant to feel bad for loving what they love. Bob and Linda would fight anyone who tried to hurt their kids and they have.  With Family Guy, I feel like Meg is the butt of all the jokes and honestly it's not that funny"
BobsBurgers,32q0d6,rw-blackbird,6,Wed Apr 15 20:50:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't gone back to watch it, but Family Guy started as 80% pop culture references mixed in with 20% racism, sexism, and sometimes homophobia, but the balance has shifted toward more offensive topics and hatred.  They might be trying to channel All in the Family thinking they're tackling important issues, but it's just hatred and laziness without the charm or wit of Carroll O'Connor."
BobsBurgers,32q0d6,geosquirrel1,3,Thu Apr 16 14:27:46 2015 UTC,See I'm fine with offensive jokes to an extent but Family Guy overdose it and half the time it's really not that funny
BobsBurgers,32q0d6,asiankim,9,Thu Apr 16 17:57:09 2015 UTC,"YES. This is exactly why I love this show. The camaraderie that the Belcher family has really makes the show special to me. Also, Bob's Burgers can be very relatable. Whereas a show like Family Guy, while it has its humorous moments, derives all of its humor from pop culture references and plain ridiculousness, the feelings that the characters of Bob's feel are ones that we've all felt. They're relatable, and their love for each other just makes the characters that much more lovable.  Side note, one of my favorite Gene quotes is when they're all at Dr. Yap's cabin and Yap shows them the ""sound proof"" room, and Gene runs in there, slams the door, and yells ""I love my family!!"". Melts my freaking heart every single time."
BobsBurgers,32q0d6,9me123,3,Thu Apr 16 00:51:56 2015 UTC,"Like I've said before, the Belchers feel like a real family. The Griffins? Not so much"

BobsBurgers,32q0d6,CaptainRumBucket,6,Thu Apr 16 13:28:58 2015 UTC,"I agree 100%!! I love the way the whole family accepts each other's weirdness and just rolls with whatever anyone says. It's a beautiful thing, and there is so much love between the characters. I don't care that its a cartoon, that show nails it on the head."
BobsBurgers,32q0d6,inmediasres1,6,Thu Apr 16 00:53:40 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean if you're comparing BB to FG, start with the fact that BB has good writing and funny jokes. But you're right, the Belchers are a cartoon family that, if the show were a live action family sitcom, would still be believable."
BobsBurgers,32q0d6,10goldbees,3,Thu Apr 16 18:21:56 2015 UTC,"Aw man, I've been saying this for so long. I'm so glad someone shares this same opinion. The Belchers family dynamic is what draws the line between this show and other animated family sitcoms. They just love each other, and it's so nice to see because we don't get it often.  I enjoy shows like Family Guy and American Dad. They're super funny and I probably won't ever stop being fans of those shows. But while they are indeed funny, at the end of the day, watching a show about a bunch of family members who hate each other gets tedious and predictable. All the ""shut up Meg"" shit gets old.  The Belchers really love, respect, and support each other. They support each other through stupid and fruitless hobbies (i.e. table-scaping). Or make each other feel better at their own expense (i.e. Louise going to the Boyz 4 Now concert for Tina). It's just refreshing to see a family that loves each other."
BobsBurgers,32q0d6,kmk1018,5,Thu Apr 16 06:49:25 2015 UTC,"It really is.  I think American Dad is funny and Family Guy have their moments. But none of them can really hold a candle to Bob's Burgers and I think that is why the show is doing well. Years later, I think it's going to hold up. It's fun but there is heart too it.  While some of these situations are over blown and random but it still feels realistic.  The family bond is strong and that really is what drives the show"

BobsBurgers,32udfu,Stinky_WhizzleTeats,2,Fri Apr 17 20:10:01 2015 UTC,"Yep. Pretty sure he says, ""I'm straight; I'm mostly straight."""
BobsBurgers,32udfu,Disco_Bloodbath,8,Sun Apr 19 02:40:44 2015 UTC,"This show is pretty open-minded about sexuality as a whole. They treat sexuality as a spectrum in a very cheeky, fun way. Especially since Gene is probably going to be a pansexual transgender when he gets older. i.e. ""Tell that to my vagina!"". I think its a very progressive show in a lot of ways, but definitely regarding gender identity and roles. It is not a traditional nuclear family even though it would outwardly appear to be one."
BobsBurgers,32udfu,kmk1018,0,Thu Apr 16 22:15:30 2015 UTC,Agreed.  And there is no doubt in my mind that Gene is trans
BobsBurgers,32udfu,thatoneguy54,0,Fri Apr 17 01:45:13 2015 UTC,How can you tell if a 11 year old is trans
BobsBurgers,32udfu,dissonancerock,0,Mon Apr 27 23:17:12 2015 UTC,"Well you can't necessarily, I meant it more that he is clearly open-minded about gender and reminds me of a few kids I knew growing up who came out as pansexual or never really adhered to a strict gender identity. It doesn't really mean that Gene will be gay or straight or whatever in-between, but I like that the character is written in a modern way that understands the nuances of gender. Also some people do know from a very young age that their biological gender assignment doesn't feel correct. 11 is definitely old enough for plenty of people."
BobsBurgers,32udfu,thatoneguy54,3,Tue Apr 28 00:07:19 2015 UTC,Turkeysexual is not a legit sexual orientation?
BobsBurgers,32udfu,dissonancerock,5,Fri Apr 17 06:45:57 2015 UTC,"He might be, Idk. But him not freaking out about being hit on by a guy isn't really a lot of evidence. A lot of straight guys would be fine with that. And Bob may just be comfortable enough with himself to know that he's not a prize catch compared to an attractive guy, you know?"

As long as the writers can keep coming up with (or stealing from the Simpsons) new ideas for episodes, I'm happy.  The reason it's possible for animated series to survive for decades is because the characters don't need to age."

Bobs retired and committed to being a old man dad, i.e. obsessed with new gadgets, forgetful etc, Linda is still Linda but grey, Teddy still comes to the resturant every day, although he's on his 3rd or 4th heart attack."

BobsBurgers,3294fd,SecondStage1983,70,Sat Apr 11 18:22:26 2015 UTC,"This is a complaint for every show that goes on past 3 seasons. People get mad because the characteristics that made them love the character is now too familiar for them. Yet, if they changed it up, people would undoubtedly be complaining ""i dont like the new direction of character x"". Everyone's entitled to their opinion, I just wish people would relax and not try to overthink it and just enjoy what amounts to free entertainment."
BobsBurgers,3294fd,slowestmojo,16,Sat Apr 11 21:36:54 2015 UTC,I would like to frame you're comment & beat people upside the head with it every time the above argument comes up. It applies to damn near everything too.
BobsBurgers,3294fd,EJ88,5,Sat Apr 11 21:49:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that the singing characteristic of Linda are what made me like Linda and it just became too familiar. In fact, it's the opposite. The first 3 seasons Linda sang maybe like three songs ""Thanksgiving song"" ""Little Babies"" and ""Bells Bells Bells Bells""? Her off the wall comments and little quirks are what made me like her in the first place, not to mention just fantastic writing for her. Now a character like , Andy and Ollie (whom I love) Zeke and Jimmy Jr.and really even Tina you can only do so much with. But Linda was a character they could have kept to being quirky and I'm just curious why they chose to make her a little more one dimensional with focusing on her singing.  Did she need a direction to go in? To hard to write for? They needed more mass appeal? Was it TV critics and executives giving them a hard time about character likability? Stuff like that Interests me and I was wondering if I was the only one who noticed the shift towards a little one dimensional ism for her character in the episodes.   Edit: to answer the above about not thinking too much about it. I'm sorry I studied TV and film in undergrad so my mind just goes these places."
BobsBurgers,3294fd,Isaystomabel,2,Sat Apr 11 23:48:25 2015 UTC,One of the few successes that comes to mind is how they changed Brian and Stewie's characters in Family Guy. I think the change in them from the early seasons to the later seasons gave that show the longevity it is enjoying now.
BobsBurgers,3294fd,bradgard420,5,Sat Apr 11 23:30:32 2015 UTC,how did they change? i stopped watching after season 3 or 4.
BobsBurgers,3294fd,Dickbeard_The_Pirate,10,Sun Apr 12 00:23:53 2015 UTC,"I know for Stewie, at least, he went from an evil, ""take over the world at any cost"", future dictator type baby to a flamboyant, ambiguously gay baby."
BobsBurgers,3294fd,tutubutt,13,Sun Apr 12 01:04:33 2015 UTC,"I feel like Bob and Linda just feel a little one dimensional this season because there hasn't really been a focus on them as characters. If there was, I think we'd see more than just a couple traits from them that they usually display. In my opinion, I feel the characters are becoming more complex. Look at Louise. She seems to be a lot kinder lately. She is more considerate of the emotions of others, and doesn't rely solely on her sociopathic persona for humor as I'd expect the writers to do if she were being flanderized. I was afraid Louise would just end up being horrible and outrageously cruel as the show went on, but it's going in an opposite direction for her. I think the problems lies more in...That there's just no focus on Linda or Bob lately so they can't do much. There are some pretty Linda centric episodes coming up, so maybe that'll shed some light on your question? Singing's always been there for Linda, so it doesn't really feel different or like it's too much...It's about the same, but it's not the entirety of her character as flanderization would imply. People throw that word around all willy nilly! Flanderization specifically applies to characters who are reduced to a single trait that gets exaggerated over time. I personally think Bob's is still too young to point fingers and claim flanderization is there. I don't feel like Linda's one dimensional at all. I really hate the mentality that everything falls apart after the third installment. That kinda thing is exactly the reason why TV shows don't usually make it pass the third season to grow."
BobsBurgers,3294fd,bruiserbrody45,8,Sat Apr 11 22:16:31 2015 UTC,"I think what happens with a show like this is the original episodes are put together with more hands on from the creators, while later seasons outside writers write for the characters and rely on their key traits"
BobsBurgers,3294fd,dickroach,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:49:12 2015 UTC,I like this answer.  It would explain a lot
BobsBurgers,3294fd,joeredspecial,9,Sun Apr 12 01:01:31 2015 UTC,"the show has gotten very formulaic since about season 3, and in turn the characters have gotten pretty once dimensional. yeah."

BobsBurgers,32ajg5,CyberSoldier8,2,Sun Apr 12 02:02:55 2015 UTC,Are you referring to the faux porno music going on while Tina writes her erotic friend fiction?

BobsBurgers,324q4s,ohsnapitsjf,5,Fri Apr 10 16:35:25 2015 UTC,Sheesh cab bob...by far my favorite episode. Everything about it is hilarious
BobsBurgers,324q4s,portysport,2,Fri Apr 10 18:03:25 2015 UTC,"I mean, even if I felt this way up until that episode, ""You're gonna need a bigger hat!"" would have bought me into a second season on its own. The second best set up and delivered line in animated comedy history."
BobsBurgers,324q4s,ohsnapitsjf,2,Fri Apr 10 18:32:25 2015 UTC,"I did think those episodes were good, but nothing particularly special. I'll probably stick with it till the end of season 2 then see how I feel."
BobsBurgers,324q4s,Sobertese,7,Fri Apr 10 18:11:27 2015 UTC,"I love Bobs burgers, but I don't find myself hysterical through most of the show for any episodes really.   I mean, I can't recall too many gut busting lines or scenes that had me in stitches, I'd say I laugh a bit at each episode, but I guess there's just another quality to it that I enjoy. It's hard to place. It's just a great show.   If you don't enjoy it, maybe skip ahead to another season, give it two episodes, maybe it evolved in a way you like. And if then it still doesn't do it for you, move on. No harm in not liking a show."
BobsBurgers,324q4s,jxl180,7,Fri Apr 10 17:06:37 2015 UTC,Kind of like King of the Hill.
BobsBurgers,324q4s,jxl180,2,Fri Apr 10 17:23:01 2015 UTC,I guess I don't see the point in watching it then. Also I never really got KotH so maybe that explains it.
BobsBurgers,324q4s,I_SPLIT_INFINITIVES,6,Fri Apr 10 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"Well, there are way more laughs than KotH, but I mean the show is more than the laughs."

BobsBurgers,324q4s,aUnicornFart,5,Fri Apr 10 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"I liken Bob's Burgers to early Simpsons episodes, in a way. We're in it for the laughs, sure, but we also love the characters and like to watch them develop emotionally and do right by each other. For that reason, you might lose out on laugh after laugh because the show is developing characters, relationships, story lines, etc...  It could be that the show just isn't for you. It could also be that the show takes some time to grow on people. If you stick around through season 2, like you said you plan to do, you'll probably find out which one is the answer."
BobsBurgers,324q4s,OptionK,4,Fri Apr 10 18:58:09 2015 UTC,"I'm 25, and have been watching since the first season. So, I was 21 when the first season aired.  Honestly, I kind of liked the show until ""Spaghetti Western and Meatballs"" That was the one where everything clicked for me and I thought it was hilarious. Laughed waaay to hard when they are outside Mr. Frond's office ""Maybe he's dehydrated?""  If you don't have it by now. Maybe the show isn't for you?"
BobsBurgers,324q4s,nick_winch,4,Fri Apr 10 23:53:43 2015 UTC,What's your average LPE (laughs per episode) with other animated comedies? What do you consider a few? These are crucial pieces of information we need to know before we can tell you what to do with your free time.
BobsBurgers,324q4s,jxl180,2,Fri Apr 10 17:06:41 2015 UTC,Well I watch Archer and certainly the first couple of seasons were good. Though I didn't particularly like Vice. I laugh about 1-2 times per episode but I've never really laughed properly.
BobsBurgers,324q4s,shmate4L,3,Fri Apr 10 18:13:49 2015 UTC,"Are you familiar with the other work of the voice actors? I'm not sure if like the show as much if I didn't already know the actors from Flight of the Conchords, Jon Benjamin has a Van, Delocated, standup, etc. Bob's Burgers kinda feels like getting to watch a bunch of my close friends having a good time together. If that makes any sense."
BobsBurgers,320qv2,kobun04,4,Thu Apr 9 17:29:43 2015 UTC,"I like the odd school centered episode, but if there are too many of them in a row it gets a bit tiring.  My fave episodes are the ones that focus primarily on the family, with maybe one or two other character. Christmas in the Car, for example. The Belchies is good too, though I suppose that has 4-5 other characters (but it's not in the school, anyway)"
BobsBurgers,320qv2,_Burgers_,3,Fri Apr 10 00:28:48 2015 UTC,"I sure can't complain because my absolute favorite character is stuck in school centric episodes (Mr. Frond.) I find school less to be the problem, and more...JUST how kid centric the show has become. In earlier episodes, there was a nice balance between kids and adults. Spaghetti Western and Meatballs and Synchronized Swimming both integrated school into their storylines while also having it so Bob and Linda could play a big part as well. Everyone felt involved and no one felt pushed aside to an irrelevant B-plot. Everything tied together. I find myself more annoyed at the ever expanding kid group...Like. Okay. The Belchers, sure! MAAAAYBE the Pestos, and Zeke if they're actually doing something, but whenever they shove Jocelyn, Rudy, or Peter Pescadero onscreen it's just...ugh! They're not distinct, in my opinion. They usually deliver one liners and they're really just not adding anything. If they want us to love these characters, they should give us a reason to instead of insisting we like them by making them appear so frequently. It'd be better if they tried to expand on each kid separately. So yeah, school centric episodes don't bother me as much as the useless kid characters. I have enjoyed them thoroughly because of Mr. Frond's appearances. It sorta feels to me they're just doing school episodes to mess with him since he always feels the most characterized...but I might just be biased here. I do hope for Bob and Linda to get their time to shine again. I just assume this season's so kid heavy because they're the reason the show is so popular. If it makes you feel any better, the script covers for season six look a whole lot less school centric. Not a single seemingly school episode out of the 8 titles we know (9 if 'My Dinner with Frondre' is season six...which is one school ep out of the 9 we know.)"

BobsBurgers,320qv2,wonderyak,2,Sat Apr 11 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah! That's a great one! But I think it has that charm because Bob and Linda are there reacting to the kid's shenanigans. Also, it's pretty much the Belcher kids. The the other students don't play major parts."
BobsBurgers,320qv2,Binary101010,3,Mon Apr 13 23:19:38 2015 UTC,"I did a lot of work on my high school's TV news program, so I really identified with Broadcast Wagstaff School News."
BobsBurgers,320qv2,Screwbit,3,Fri Apr 10 02:11:14 2015 UTC,agreed.  Season 4 and especially 5 have too many episodes taking place at Wagstaff and focusing on the kids.
BobsBurgers,320qv2,doctorfrankenskein,2,Mon Apr 13 20:37:44 2015 UTC,"I was kind of thinking that last night. I watched the chinchilla episode and didn't like it as much. And the fashion show one. Yeah, it's a riff on The Breakfast Club...but I didn't like the next top model/fashion designer feel to it.  I felt like this was a missed opportunity to really push forward on the TBC theme or draw in other things like Home Alone or Uncle Buck. Hell any other John Hughs film. Planes, trains, & automobiles? I'm just not as attached to season 5 as I was for the other seasons."
BobsBurgers,320qv2,doctorfrankenskein,3,Thu Apr 9 19:35:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean The Belchies and O.T. The Outside Toilet were pretty good homages. Not straight parodies but good original stories using similar plots.  I don't want to be a hater. I really love the show. I guess I love Bob and Linda so much I had when they're treated as secondary characters and Tammy or Zeke get more screen time than them."

BobsBurgers,31tirt,tutubutt,3,Wed Apr 8 02:48:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with this statement! It's best to start off with generally amusing episodes rather than showing the best of the best because what's that gonna make everything else look like in comparison? I was personally amused just watching it from the beginning.

I suggest ironing the freezer paper to the shirt before cutting out any stencil, your lines will be crisper.   Don't worry, you won't cut through the shirt, just don't press very firmly.  I invested in a $10 swivel x-acto knife and it was very helpful cutting on the shirt.  For this shirt in particular, I cut out the accessories first (glasses and bunny ears) sprayed the bleach mix and dabbed with paper towels so it didn't bleed.  Then sprayed and dabbed again to make sure those parts were bright.  Then I ironed the shirt again to dry it, and cut out the rest of the stencil.  I sprayed the rest of the stencil once to make sure it would have a good contrast with the accessories.  I used a Merona cotton tee from Target for this shirt.  Different shirts create different tones with the bleach.  Some end up whiter than others.  Sorry I didn't post instructions in the first place!"

She's way closer to him than her mom. Remember  the episode where she gets pissed off that Gene is butting in on her time with him? There was also a scene where they were joking about them getting divorce and she calls going with dad. They also bonded a lot in that museum episode, even admitting that she's wants to take over the restaurant.   On the other hand, she tends to but heads with Linda a lot. Bob too, but with Linda way more often.  If it was up to them, Louise would go with Bob. Gene would go with Linda, and I don't know where Tina would go."

BobsBurgers,31m2tu,feodo,3,Tue Apr 7 22:35:48 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a shot:  The kids love him and all enjoy working in the restaurant. When he fires them so they can have normal childhoods they take it personally and immediately try to find a new job to replace it, so I don't think he's exactly got them ""slaving away.""  The point about how much he pays them is nonsense. It's a family business, they are working so they can have a roof over their heads and food and clothes. The fact that he gives them little of their own personal money is inconsequential when you consider the fact that they are all working together to make their lives possible.  As for Bob's splurging on the love tester machine, this was an uncharacteristic act of splurging that was for his WIFE, not for him, and he spent the entire day having an adventure with his children to get it. This is an especially unselfish instance in the show, so it seems bizarre to try to paint it as a selfish expense on Bob's part.  The kids all clearly love him him very much, as is evidenced by almost every single episode.    If the couple ever got a divorce, only Tina would choose to stay with him, out of pity.   This is particularly laughable. It is made extremely clear that Louise loves Bob, loves spending time with him, and actually plans to take over the restaurant when Bob is too old to run it. She also doesn't particularly care to spend time with her mother. Louise would never live with Linda over Bob.  The OP seems strangely materialistic to me. ""There is little to thank."" Yeah, except for a loving and supportive family made up of members that consistently go to extremes for each other, often at the expense of their own personal convenience.  In a show FILLED with unreasonable jerks, naming Bob or any member of the Belcher family as the worst offender is absolutely crazy."
BobsBurgers,31m2tu,AstrylFlash,-2,Thu Apr 9 21:37:58 2015 UTC,I know Bob's financial ignorance is part of the settings for his character...

BobsBurgers,31iqth,Whynautilus,7,Sun Apr 5 15:36:30 2015 UTC,They're both kinda helpless and needy. She wants a man and he wants a woman. They both have extreme social ineptitude and somewhat strange personal habits.

BobsBurgers,31gnqa,earthsick,13,Sat Apr 4 22:44:28 2015 UTC,I think shes referred to it as a dress.
BobsBurgers,31gnqa,stride_gum,10,Sun Apr 5 00:39:56 2015 UTC,I think the argument for large shirt is based on her personality. I don't think Louise would be into things like dresses.

Also, Louise threatened to wear bunnies ears the rest of her life if her parents made her wear a dress. Her parents called her bluff since they were worried Louise was too masculine and that the she would eventually grow out of the bunny ears. That's why she's so adamant about the ears, because it allows her to argue that no one can force her to do anything. Fact"

BobsBurgers,31d4k7,jarrettbrown,10,Sun Apr 5 22:45:16 2015 UTC,I don't get it. Why would you get something tattooed on your body that in 10 years will not be as cool as you think it is?
BobsBurgers,31d4k7,EverybodysPoop,9,Sat Apr 4 15:03:07 2015 UTC,My idea in getting Tina is that it will become one of many tattoos that will reside on my body and Tina will simply become a sort of marker of the times that allows me to look back at who I was in that moment. I waited a long time to get tattoos and to this day I have not regretted a single one.
BobsBurgers,31d4k7,teenagediplomat,8,Sun Apr 5 22:44:15 2015 UTC,10 years?  It's already not as cool as he thinks it is.

BobsBurgers,31d4k7,glegleglo,3,Sat Apr 4 16:17:07 2015 UTC,"The folks on this sub seem to hate on tattoos an awful lot*. /r/discworld seems to quite like them, but man, not /r/BobsBurgers. It often seems that driving meaning from the show beyond making a costume is just not okay here."
BobsBurgers,31d4k7,Crustal_Math,8,Sun Apr 5 23:23:00 2015 UTC,"Not that I'm knocking it, but pop culture tattoos aren't always a good idea. Granted, some of them could be cool. But in this case, it's a bad idea. In 10 years, is the show going to be relevant or still on the air? Probably not. It's just a mistake in my opinion."
BobsBurgers,31gzhg,Sprinkliees,6,Sun Apr 5 00:08:32 2015 UTC,"The 'show X happens in the imagination of character Y' argument is not an argument at all, since every show could be linked to every other show as well. Game of Thrones could be happening in the mind of Papa Smurf."
BobsBurgers,31gzhg,blackbasset,2,Mon Apr 6 00:22:05 2015 UTC,The main characters have the same voices and the existence of a crossover episode
BobsBurgers,31gzhg,blackbasset,3,Mon Apr 6 22:27:40 2015 UTC,"Still, this does not imply they exist in the same universe. On the contrary, the way you put it, Archer as a dream of Bob is more of a metadiegetic story, being embedded in Bobs Burgers. So they don't share the same universe, Archer is fictional in Bobs Burgers, as well.  The 'crossover' episode (it is not really a crossover like... CSI:Miami and CSI:New York did) contradicts a shared universe as well: From the perspective of Bobs Burgers, there is no indication that the events and characters in Archer exist in its universe. From the perspective of Archer, there isn't one for Bobs Burgers, either: The episode with Archer thinking he's a burger cook called Bob does not correspond with the story of the series Bobs Burgers: Bob/Archer turns up one day and leaves after a few months, trying to find why Russians try to kill him. We know that's not the case in Bobs Burgers.  And using the same voice(s) (the main casts of both only share H. Jon Benjamin) does not reinforce your theory either. If anything, they contradict your theory. If same (voice) actors were a plausible indication for shared universe, not only Arrested Development and Archer would share the same universe (Jessica Walter, Jeffrey Tambor, Judy Greer, David Cross...), but every series and movie ever made would, via connection of shared actors. (See: Six Degrees of Kevin Bavon)  Edit: That doesn't mean that there aren't any similarities and references between Bobs Burgers and Archer, of course. It just does not imply that they share a universe, and that at any point, Louise could run into Pam, or Teddy into Ray.  Edit²: On the other hand, looking at characters running into each other, Adam Reeds other shows, Frisky Dingo and Sealab 2021, seem to take place in the same universe as Archer, at least in an alternate way."

BobsBurgers,30ybfp,dreybu,74,Tue Mar 31 20:10:18 2015 UTC,Presumably Jimmy legally changed his name to Pesto.
BobsBurgers,30ybfp,Dapples,25,Tue Mar 31 18:52:15 2015 UTC,That makes sense.

BobsBurgers,30ybfp,JJFO,24,Wed Apr 1 14:02:24 2015 UTC,Because Jimmy Pesto is their dad.
BobsBurgers,30ybfp,alexlp,9,Tue Mar 31 18:44:54 2015 UTC,But Jimmy's last name isn't Pesto.
BobsBurgers,30ybfp,breadburger,8,Tue Mar 31 19:26:01 2015 UTC,See /u/redsox113's comment. That's what makes the most sense to me.
BobsBurgers,30ybfp,Kendallsan,5,Tue Mar 31 20:08:13 2015 UTC,"Jimmy Poplopovich's would be a bad name for an ""Italian"" Restaurant, so he goes by Jimmy Pesto instead."
BobsBurgers,30ybfp,Prefekt64,2,Wed Apr 1 02:08:01 2015 UTC,"I get why Jimmy changed his name, but the kids go to school with the Belcher kids. You figure in roll call or something the kids would have heard them called Andy/Ollie/Jimmy Poplopovich."
BobsBurgers,30ybfp,dungareejones,2,Wed Apr 1 02:12:02 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, kids get weird nicknames. Like my sisters and I were all known as ducky, independently of each other."
BobsBurgers,30ybfp,knox_vile,21,Wed Apr 1 04:57:19 2015 UTC,Because nicknames?
BobsBurgers,30ybfp,bigangry,16,Tue Mar 31 19:33:52 2015 UTC,"I have a friend whose last name is Fischer, but everyone calls him Fish. His kid would be Fish's kid.   His real name is kinda irrelevant - Fish is how he is known. So will his kid be, to us anyway.  Jimmy Jr. is no fan of his dad, so maybe he rebels by using the real name.  I hate my father, changed my name shortly after I stopped talking to him, about 30 years ago.  Shit happens. Even in awesome burger-cartoon-land..."
BobsBurgers,30ybfp,shmate4L,11,Tue Mar 31 22:10:55 2015 UTC,Just think of it like Hulk Hogan. His kids go by Hogan as well.
BobsBurgers,30ybfp,Xtremik,7,Tue Mar 31 22:37:04 2015 UTC,Honestly I did not know his last name wasn't really Hogan.

Gene claims she flaunts her behind all the time, and she does her pregnant yoga, keeping her pelvic floor perky, and kegel toning  So I believe her a v and her breasts are her leftover parts, because even though I'm sure she breast fed alll her children, her largest child stopped feeding at some point and I feel like Louise didn't want the breast as a rebel baby  This is all pure fan speculation just trying to humor you, just ask any pregnant woman what gets destroyed while pregnant, and raising 3 kids, does to a body. Best solution ask Linda"

The director says ok, frame Tina here, zoom here, shift background there, and then maybe notices at a certain angle that Tina's head covers the ""Cl"" of classroom, and thinks it's a great idea.

Beaker, not so much since his head is a fixed cylinder and his mouth actually hinges out away from his upper lip by the pull of an internal mechanism.  The Bob's character designs are influenced more by Kermit, Fozzie or any of the others who's heads are shaped so that the puppeteer can articulate the mouth with his/her full hand."
BobsBurgers,30kqmt,MisterSynister,9,Sat Mar 28 05:46:36 2015 UTC,i'm surprised kevin klein wasn't too cool or expensive to be there.

BobsBurgers,30kqmt,youreatowel69,9,Sat Mar 28 14:30:04 2015 UTC,Kevin Kline and Jermaine Clement singing Electric Love was pure poetry.
BobsBurgers,30kqmt,T8ert0t,3,Sat Mar 28 13:25:35 2015 UTC,Jemaine hit those high notes like a mother. Wasn't expecting him to pop out at all.
BobsBurgers,30kqmt,CherryDarling10,2,Sat Mar 28 16:38:38 2015 UTC,Yeah I popped hard for Kline...popped even harder for Clement...

BobsBurgers,30kqmt,icase81,4,Sat Mar 28 07:01:19 2015 UTC,"Lucky!  It sold out quickly, and tickets were going for like $150 that day. Too rich for my blood, sadly."
BobsBurgers,30kqmt,princessvail,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:12:09 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I paid on top of the extra 125 for the VIP upgrade

BobsBurgers,30kbd6,nikinooodle,14,Sat Mar 28 02:51:49 2015 UTC,"Wait..have I been really dense and not noticing the name of the town was Wagstaff? I thought that was just the name of the school, but I guess it makes sense that it could be the town as well."
BobsBurgers,30kbd6,JRSly,5,Sat Mar 28 05:47:28 2015 UTC,"If the name of their town is Wagstaff, it's news to me too."
BobsBurgers,30kbd6,hotfudgemonday,8,Sat Mar 28 08:36:07 2015 UTC,Actually I think the town name is oceanside. It says oceanside bank in the first mickey episode..
BobsBurgers,30kbd6,corndoggy67,14,Sat Mar 28 10:32:12 2015 UTC,On the burgerboss episode Linda says hi to the mayor.
BobsBurgers,30kbd6,zozeba,7,Sat Mar 28 03:08:23 2015 UTC,"The town has not yet been named, and at this point I think that's kind of a thing.  'Wagstaff' (after Professor Quincy Adams Wagstaff from ""Horse Feathers"") is only the name of the elementary-middle school. 'Oceanside' would be the name of what is probably a smallish corporate bank operating it's branches along the east coast.  Fischoeder isn't the mayor, nor does he own the whole town.  He does, however own a considerable amount of real estate in the immediate area of Wonder Wharf, including the blocks of Ocean Avenue where most of the show takes place."
BobsBurgers,30kbd6,Eddie_Chester,5,Sat Mar 28 15:57:26 2015 UTC,"And we learned at the live show that its not far from Wildwood, NJ. Linda gets on a local bus and the guy says 'Next stop, Wildwood Wharf.'"

BobsBurgers,30hdzp,Eddie_Chester,2,Fri Mar 27 19:26:38 2015 UTC,"No worries.  We're cool.  And just to clarify, I think the fan-created/commercially-sold shirts are kind of a grey area.  On the one hand they do get the characters and concepts out in public view and that promotes the show, which is not an inconsiderable thing given that Fox has not to date been very aggressive in merchandising the show.  On the other hand, one of the few types of officially licensed Bob's Burgers merchandise that's actually available is T-shirts, the purchase of which directly contributes to the show's viability.  From what I can tell, the production has been pretty cool about fan-created merch so far, but at some point it seems like it'll become problematic."
BobsBurgers,30hdzp,TheRobotsArentComing,4,Sat Mar 28 15:39:23 2015 UTC,"I know replying to trolls is never a good thing, but being called an Asshole is never a lot of fun. So I just wanted to clarify.  This isn't a bootleg. I clearly am not involved with the show and never claimed to be.  If you're familiar with sites like TeeFury, they print geek parody/satire shirts like this. The legal term for shirts like this are fair use and parodies."
BobsBurgers,30hdzp,whitevein,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"The fact that the proper rights holders haven't decided to send you a cease and desist letter or sue you doesn't mean this is fair use.  That would be an issue for a court to decide, however, what you've done would almost definitely not fall under fair use.  Let's just call it what it is: You're using someone else's intellectual property without their permission to make money for yourself."

BobsBurgers,30dcq6,productofskwat,18,Thu Mar 26 13:35:39 2015 UTC,"Videos:  H. Jon Benjamin & Eugene Mirman Intro  Dan Mintz Standup  John Roberts Standup  Kristen Schaal Standup  Eugene Mirman Standup  H. Jon Benjamin Standup  Table Reading  Q&A - Missed the begining, but this was my question ""Which one of you is the strongest, most sensual woman?""  Didn't get this on film, but the best quote from the Q&A was this: Question: H. Jon Benjamin, what's it like having a deep sexy voice? H. Jon: It's all in the dick"
BobsBurgers,30dcq6,hopesdead,12,Thu Mar 26 16:37:46 2015 UTC,"Haha. Someone yelled ""Danger Zone"" during Benjamin's standup. Honestly if anyone hears that and doesn't know about Archer... they are missing out."
BobsBurgers,30dcq6,frenchieRU,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:11:42 2015 UTC,"Same guy kept yelling stuff throughout the night, he got louder during John Roberts and Jon Benjamin's sets."
BobsBurgers,30dcq6,hopesdead,3,Thu Mar 26 20:25:22 2015 UTC,So the description for the table read says a un-aired episode. Was that a fully produced episode or just a script for a not fully produced episode?
BobsBurgers,30dcq6,hopesdead,4,Thu Mar 26 17:16:38 2015 UTC,Fully produced episode that will air later!
BobsBurgers,30dcq6,carl7967,3,Thu Mar 26 17:19:36 2015 UTC,A Teddy centric episode sounds nice. He used to be a throw away background character but over time I like how he is becoming more developed and used in the stories.
BobsBurgers,30dcq6,scottlapier,7,Thu Mar 26 17:23:02 2015 UTC,Used to be? His stay at the bed & breakfast in season 1 is probably my favorite episode.

My friend and I had Very limited time to speak to the cast, as the people behind us were pushing us along. We weren't allowed to ask them to stand up to take photos with us, but could take pictures of them, or have a friend take a photo of you with them in the background. Personally, it was worth it cause I got to talk to H. Jon Benjamin and he signed my drawing ""I love you too"""
BobsBurgers,30dcq6,frenchieRU,4,Thu Mar 26 14:57:13 2015 UTC,"Tbh, I'm mostly doing it for the special stuff...especially the Kuchi Kopi. Thanks for answering, I'm glad you had a good time."

BobsBurgers,30j4lf,grocho,6,Fri Mar 27 20:34:25 2015 UTC,"And the odds of the always sunny plot being original? Probably slim.   There's nothing wrong with an homage. If you dislike this you must dislike a lot of the episodes, especially the recent 'Gayle Tales' episode, that blatantly took from 3 different shows/books."
BobsBurgers,30j4lf,noworthyicon,-6,Fri Mar 27 20:38:16 2015 UTC,"Find me an example that specific that came before always sunny?   I didn't mind the Gayle Tales episode, because that was an homage. It's not like the Foodie episode was an homage to always sunny, it was just a rip off. There is a difference"
BobsBurgers,30j4lf,Regerton,10,Fri Mar 27 20:41:02 2015 UTC,"Well, there IS an episode of Friends in which Monica's restaurant gets a bad review from a food critic and she hunts him down with some of her homemade soup to make him change his mind. It doesn't goes to the extremes IASIP or Bob's Burgers does (e.g. no kidnapping or duct tape)."
BobsBurgers,30j4lf,noworthyicon,4,Fri Mar 27 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"I'm nor finding you anything. But I'd put money on the 'bad review, find the reviewer and express displeasure' storyline wasn't firs conceived in 2008.   And how exactly do you differentiate homage and rip off? A four year gap between the two episodes is hardly ripping it off in my opinion."
BobsBurgers,30j4lf,dissonancerock,0,Fri Mar 27 20:48:50 2015 UTC,Flowers for Charlie. (Although that's also an homage)
BobsBurgers,30j4lf,hottoddy4me,1 point,Fri Mar 27 22:57:29 2015 UTC,Bob's Burgers does a lot of episodes like this. I don't think of them as ripping them off. I think of them as paying homage to those before them! And I think they are hilarious!
BobsBurgers,30j4lf,Brian_M,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:02:06 2015 UTC,"I like homage episodes when they sort of subvert or skew the thing they're homaging in a clever way. Sometimes with things like South Park or Family Guy they basically just retell the same story but in their own characters' voices, and hope that'll be funny enough, which it isn't."
BobsBurgers,30j4lf,airmancoop44,1 point,Sat Mar 28 12:50:52 2015 UTC,When has South Park done this?
BobsBurgers,30j4lf,Brian_M,1 point,Sun Mar 29 18:59:54 2015 UTC,A good example is the sub-plot of Nightmare on Facetime where Stan's dad buys Blockbuster and they just do a lazy Shining rip-off set in the store.
BobsBurgers,30j4lf,airmancoop44,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:02:27 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I wouldn't really call that a rip-off though, but it is certainly a reference at the very least. Definitely not a re-telling with the South Park characters."

BobsBurgers,305teu,JSKlunk,14,Tue Mar 24 22:53:36 2015 UTC,"Pilots are rarely ever as good as the show that comes after. They're basically a ""proof of concept""; a rough sketch version of the show."
BobsBurgers,305teu,Omny87,9,Tue Mar 24 19:34:27 2015 UTC,"I heard (I have no idea if it is true) that originally the family was going to be serving human flesh from the Mort's crematorium. If that is true maybe what you are not liking is this original tone that was removed in the other episodes.   PS I agree, the pilot wasn't the strongest episode but it has gotten much better!"
BobsBurgers,305teu,shanata,8,Tue Mar 24 18:49:40 2015 UTC,"Im really glad they didn't go in that direction. The black comedy cannibalism trope woulda gotten old real fast.,"
BobsBurgers,305teu,Lolnahnowaynope,10,Tue Mar 24 19:35:40 2015 UTC,"This was from the original short proof-of-concept film that was produced to sell the show, which is among the special features on the Season One DVD set.  A very different looking Bob and Linda (the look was sort of Ronald Searle by way of Adult Swim) are seen having the same conversation about Bob forgetting their anniversary that they have in the first broadcast episode, except that they're feeding pieces of corpses into the meat grinder instead of chunks of beef.  The scene ends with Bob presenting Linda with a piece of jewelry he finds on one of the corpses, which she accepts as proof that he had remembered the occasion and was just stringing her along to make it a surprise.  I've always suspected that the cannibalism angle was mostly a means to get the network's attention and was easily disposed of when they came back saying ""Can they not be cannibals?"""
BobsBurgers,305teu,Eddie_Chester,6,Wed Mar 25 05:56:00 2015 UTC,"It usually takes a show five or six episodes to really find its footing.  Even after that shows will evolve as the cast and crew discover what does and doesn't work and find their unique chemistry.  IMO, in the best cases that process of discovery is an ongoing part of making the show."
BobsBurgers,305teu,Eddie_Chester,4,Wed Mar 25 05:35:27 2015 UTC,"The earlier episodes, especially the pilot, also seemed darker and more 'adult' themed in jokes and story, whereas the newer ones seem to be more 'family fun'-oriented. I actually like both versions, but the way Bobs Burgers is right now makes it one of the sweetest and most hilarious-while-not-insulting shows on tv."
BobsBurgers,305teu,blackbasset,3,Thu Mar 26 00:34:52 2015 UTC,"I liked the pilot, but only after I came back and watched it again. Part of the reason for that, I think, is just how much I LOVED the second episode (Kuchi Kopi, the many ""Shining"" references, Bob's descent into madness, etc...)"
BobsBurgers,305teu,Cyrano_De_BIRDATTACK,2,Wed Mar 25 03:43:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, the pilot never sold me, but I really got into the show when Season 2 started... now I feel like I missed out on a bunch of classic S1 episodes and it's not on Netflix in Canada. -_-"
BobsBurgers,305teu,_Burgers_,2,Tue Mar 24 20:16:43 2015 UTC,"The pilot episodes for most series are kind of weak, especially when compared to what comes afterward as the writers and actors find what works for the characters and what doesn't."

That and Tina is all shirt and no skirt, if that makes any sense.   Of course she's a cartoon character, not a person. This is a great costume by any standard. It's just an interesting reminder that, like The Simpsons, some cartoons are difficult to dress up as!  It's a weird uncanny valley situation: Futurama is doable because the people look fairly normal, and Adventuretime is doable because the characters look so inhuman that it's not possible, but Bob's is HARD!"
BobsBurgers,2zyk05,ericmm76,2,Mon Mar 23 12:58:53 2015 UTC,"Yes it's so true! Tina wears a blue skirt but I had to go for black, she also has shorter, darker hair than me. I think I opted for a skirt that was too big so it didn't look in any way sexy (unless people are into that kind of thing)"

And for all he knows, in the amount of time it would take for the police to arrive his counter is already damaged and Trish is already long gone. With repairs sure to cost more than the price of the magazines, Bob chose the path of least resistance."

The dad and his kids left shortly after the show the show started, so there were 3 or 4 front row seats open right smack in the middle of the stage. The venue tried filling the seats with other people and that's when Jon got upset. Lots of sides to this story. Oh well, it was great show and I'm thrilled I was there."

BobsBurgers,2zrznh,snowlarbear,1 point,Sat Mar 21 05:33:50 2015 UTC,"the description you heard was rather generous. it was maybe 1-2 lines about how he didn't like minneapolis, then he talked about his time in chicago and neo-nazis for 1-2 sentences, talked about how he found a cocaine test at walgreens, then tried to build up a story about his piano playing.  i thought his set was really disjointed and kinda killed the atmosphere for me. it seemed like he just wanted to pace around and drink wine or water.  later during the Q&A, he kept chiming in with random stuff rather than letting the other people talk. i found him kinda annoying, and ultimately more archer than bob. oh well."
BobsBurgers,2zrznh,Valor0us,0,Sat Mar 21 06:04:18 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this. Everyone had a great set and then I just kind of sat there bored for all of his ""jokes"".

BobsBurgers,2zt4bs,andyman492,3,Sat Mar 21 15:16:33 2015 UTC,Yep. It's funny because you could tell the cast was annoyed. Hahah
BobsBurgers,2zt4bs,chicagoredditer1,8,Sat Mar 21 15:24:37 2015 UTC,"I thought the whole thing was one of the highlights of the night (at the Chicago show). It seemed to me the cast was more than game to play along and ""intrude"", in a comic way, in the moment."
BobsBurgers,2zt4bs,amiths18,5,Sat Mar 21 15:48:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I agree. The cast definitely had a say about which cards to read, and did not seem annoyed whatsoever! In fact, I think they used it as a platform for great comedy -- their improv was hilarious and one of the highlights of the night. Also, from the video clip I've seen, it lasted about 5 minutes (not 25 minutes). Furthermore, they did not make fun of the couple whatsoever.   Bob's Burgers is all about awkward and hilarious family moments -- why would you go to the show if you don't find this sort of stuff enjoyable?"
BobsBurgers,2zt4bs,amiths18,-3,Sat Mar 21 16:01:23 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree. It felt like 25 minutes to me, I'm not sure if that clip captured the entire ordeal."

BobsBurgers,2zt4bs,chicagoredditer1,1 point,Sat Mar 21 23:55:29 2015 UTC,You must have missed Dan Mintz's face palm when that card was read lol
BobsBurgers,2zt4bs,MaybeWeShouldRun,3,Sat Mar 21 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"You must have missed Dan Mintz smiling throughout the whole thing. Besides, a face palm to this sort of emotional thing is exactly what I would expect from Dan Mintz lol. Need another refresher at just how happy the cast was to do this? Just watch the clip.   You realize that, if the couple actually reads this, how hurt they would be? 10 minutes at MOST out of the Q&A portion hardly seems like an imposition. Were all the other questions also impositions? That section was for the fans. This couple did not detract at all from the main gumption of the show. The fact that the cast and the show's creator wanted to end the show on this note (which, by the way, it would have ended after the Q&A portion anyway), just shows how on-board and excited everyone was.   Don't ruin a fun and lovely experience just because you are clearly jealous and trying to guilt trip others unnecessarily.   Also,  ""What's your favorite basketball?"" ""It was the Platoon thing... Oh that was Dan's timer!""  Some of the best lines from the whole show happened in this stint. In fact, I think it was the funniest HJ Benjamin was all night!!"

BobsBurgers,2zpbtd,regular_k,2,Fri Mar 20 19:58:51 2015 UTC,I thought of a couple today after last nights debacle. 1. For all: what comedian and/or actor inspired you to pursue a career in entertainment. I think that is a relevant question? Maybe? 2. What is your favorite real life burger to eat. That's  just a silly one. Just don't have them pressure you into proposing to anyone on the spot. But then again I imagine you'll be more attentive than some of those who we're asking questions last night.  Have fun it was a great show!
BobsBurgers,2zpbtd,lordjupiter,2,Fri Mar 20 17:30:41 2015 UTC,"The character designs of the show are quite minimalist, despite the various trademarks of each character (Bob's moustache, Tina and Linda's glasses, Louise's hat, Gene's chubbiness etc.). That said, do you picture the Belchers and co. resembling or recalling anyone in particular? Do you consider Tina or Louise the breakout star of the show? Will we ever see Linda's phone buddy Ginger?   *4. Another one; are certain characters Home Movies parallels? Such as Mrs. Jacobson and Melissa or Randy and Brendon?"
BobsBurgers,2zo1jb,ull90,13,Fri Mar 20 04:31:08 2015 UTC,"I was just upset with the Q and A. So many stupid questions. Also, no one wants to hear about your stupid stories about how something super significant happened in your life that involved one of the cast members, especially the cast members themselves. Do you really think the dream you had is interesting to anyone? Do you really think you're the only fan of Jon Benjamin's that counts? Do you really think he fucking cares that you had a ""religious experience"" when you heard his voice live, but not when you met the Dalai Lama (btw, real statement from one of the people asking a question)? Do you really think he remembers you from fucking middle school? Jesus Christ. It's no wonder so many people left early.   The Q and A is not a platform to brag. It's not a platform to ask them to read lines you came up with in a dream or just in your fan fiction. It's not a platform to try to make everything about you as quite a few fans did. Seriously, the person who bragged about having met the Dalai Lama also commanded the cast to focus on her. What the fuck? Who are you? You paid money to see them and ask a question, not ramble on about how you're the biggest fan they know and how you're better because you had a fucking religious experience when you heard Jon's voice. Ask your question and move on. That Q and A was almost unbearable, but we made it to the end when the last guy in the line came after the cutoff and excused himself by saying he was in the bathroom. Ugh."
BobsBurgers,2zo1jb,andyman492,8,Fri Mar 20 05:23:08 2015 UTC,"All of this. If you want to hear a voice actor say a famous line watch the show. ""Can you say this super famous line?"" Is not a question for a q&a."

BobsBurgers,2zo1jb,nightspark_,4,Fri Mar 20 05:14:56 2015 UTC,People at the q&a were asking terrible questions. A lot of them asked the cast to repeat a line from anything ranging from past shows to a fan segment they had done. The marriage proposal came from a guy asking Jon to do a quote but decided to tell the whole story about how he and his girlfriend met before asking Jon to do the line. A lot of people also asked questions about what certain characters think about things or what they will be doing in future episodes.  There were only a few questions about the actors themselves or even about making the show.  Also a lot of people were trying really hard to be really funny.  The entire show before that was great.
BobsBurgers,2zo1jb,iFucksuperheroes,3,Fri Mar 20 05:25:51 2015 UTC,"Reading this and ull90's comment, I can definitely see why the Q&A is being referred to as a train wreck. I can understand asking about characters though, as they are actually relevant to the show. I'd actually like to know more about my favorite characters, so it makes sense to use a Q&A as an opportunity to get a little bit more insight on characters not typically expanded on in the show. Asking the actors to repeat lines or use it as an opportunity to talk about yourself does sound pretty grueling, though. I don't blame people for bailing."
BobsBurgers,2zo1jb,nightspark_,3,Fri Mar 20 05:35:35 2015 UTC,I agree but the kinds of questions these people were asking sounded like they thought the cast wrote all of the scripts.  Someone asked Kristen Schaal if Louise was going to have another crush.  Most of them were questions the actors had no idea how to answer.

And Bob points out how Teddy eats there everyday and it starts a whole shouting match between bob and teddy and Gordon tries to break it up but its all just too intense for him

BobsBurgers,2xqese,kcman011,11,Tue Mar 3 01:38:21 2015 UTC,"Eh, different strokes for different folks.  I also really enjoyed Season 3 of House of Cards even though most people thought it was weak. That's the good thing about opinions: they differ."
BobsBurgers,2xqese,JohnQZoidberg,6,Tue Mar 3 01:41:50 2015 UTC,I loved it. It had a lot of good moments from the kids
BobsBurgers,2xqese,cruzweb,6,Tue Mar 3 02:42:43 2015 UTC,"I thought it was really well done. It's very difficult for these half hour animated shows to get the mini-stories thing done well. That gives you somewhere around 5-6 minutes to tell a story, with a beginning, middle, and end and have it get better each time. The Simpsons were bad at it. Family guy was bad at it. Futurama was bad at it. South Park was bad at it. But this one? It turned out pretty damn good for an episode of shorts. They're almost always going to be weaker episodes in general, there's less to get a good buildup to something interesting since you go from beginning to end so quickly. That's what makes this one fun, because even if it's not a great episode by objective comparison to full length BB episodes, it's a good episode by objective comparison to every other 3 part animated half hour spot I've seen.   Perfect? No. But a very good job and a fun episode."
BobsBurgers,2xqese,The_Mighty_Rex,3,Tue Mar 3 20:34:13 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed it but I've never watched GoT so some of it probably went over my head
BobsBurgers,2xqese,labajada,2,Tue Mar 3 20:35:18 2015 UTC,I highly recommend Got. It has a 9.5 on IMDB and was featured in Bob's Burgers so it's probably worth the watch. Season 5 starts in a month so you have time to catch up. I marathoned the first 3 seasons and had some of the craziest dreams of my life.  spoiler: There are no Cat Dragons.
BobsBurgers,2xqese,The_Mighty_Rex,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:03:22 2015 UTC,My sister and her friends all watch it and my best friend's dad who is my consultant on all things cinematic loves it so maybe I'll give it a shot
BobsBurgers,2xqese,luckylizard,5,Tue Mar 3 21:08:58 2015 UTC,I was really looking forward to this episode when I heard it was Gayle-centered because she is one of the best side characters. Mildly disappointed with Gene and Louise's stories but Tina's was great.
BobsBurgers,2xqese,krashmania,2,Tue Mar 3 06:50:41 2015 UTC,"I was enjoying it up until Louise's story, but that what probably my favourite segment of Bob's burgers ever. Aside from maybe calling Tina autistic in the pilot, that had me going pretty hard too."

BobsBurgers,2xqese,farkenell,3,Wed Mar 4 00:19:01 2015 UTC,that part of the story was kinda weak but I did enjoy tina's and gene's stories.
BobsBurgers,2xqese,theworldbystorm,9,Tue Mar 3 02:22:55 2015 UTC,"The ""Sense and Sensibility"" parody was by far the strongest part of the episode."

BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,addisonavenue,32,Mon Mar 2 00:38:53 2015 UTC,"How great are these episodes?   It's always a gamble when shows break convention, but for a show like Bob's (where routine is the name of the game) trying new modes of storytelling opens up the characters to newer forms of expression and it shows in each of the kids' tales, from the costuming to the world they choose to the way each of their Linda's get drunk.  We've seen Bob's Burgers play with the kids interpreting the world around them in vignette style before in The Frond Files, where each Belcher had a very distinct voice and way of characterising a shared enemy, and it's with that observation that The Gayle Tales sags a little in it's initial premise. Where Gayle Tales elevates itself however is with the close to home peppering of the little details. It's very telling for instance of the ages and knowledge of popular culture in the way each Belcher sibling uses Scott Bakula; Tina directly references Quantum Leap, Gene associates Bakula with Hollywood and desire, but nothing more and Louise's tale, despite being the more tv relevant, utilises him as an afterthought.   Equally insightful but more adorable are the jabs Linda's children take at her through their essays. Can something be said for how Louise saw a bigger threat in Linda's porcelain babies? Or in how though Gene recognises Linda's musicality, doesn't see her as on his level? And what about Tina in being perhaps the most accurate in detailing Linda's wine consumption?  While this wasn't the careful thread pulling of The Millie-Churian Candidate, The Gayle Tales did offer more than The Frond Files in heart and style, all in all pulling together a very comfy episode of Bob's Burgers."
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,theworldbystorm,8,Tue Mar 3 02:12:49 2015 UTC,"Excellent analysis of the kid's distinct voices- although it's worth noting that Louise portrays Linda as a Cersei Lannister stand in, which would certainly tie in with her drinking. Also, she has a fountain of wine in that story."
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,addisonavenue,3,Tue Mar 3 03:17:13 2015 UTC,"All stories feature Linda drinking, and yes I caught the wine fountain in Louise's story. What I mean with noting Tina's use of Linda's drinking is that it was the more realistic of the three."

BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,compaqesc,3,Mon Mar 2 00:36:13 2015 UTC,Louise doesn't strike me as someone who would do/enjoy GoT. I thought she would go more action or sci-fi in her story like Escape from New York or Alien?
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,theworldbystorm,17,Mon Mar 2 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"How would Louise not enjoy the Machiavellian scheming of GoT? Also, she probably watches/pirates tons of HBO. She seems like a Boardwalk Empire fan."
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,compaqesc,-1,Tue Mar 3 03:15:37 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think she would think it's ""nerdy"". She's a real tomboy so I believe she would try and pick something ""tough"" or more ""macho"". Her choosing to be ""Ellen Ripley"" or ""Lara Croft"" tomb raider would've fit more with her character."
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,nifflerqueen,9,Tue Mar 3 05:21:03 2015 UTC,Louise totally has a bit of Arya in her.
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,theworldbystorm,2,Tue Mar 3 06:08:38 2015 UTC,It's a crossover hit! It's human stories set in a fantasy world!
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,Eddie_Chester,2,Tue Mar 3 17:52:23 2015 UTC,Louise probably knows who Ripley is thanks to edited runs of the Alien movies on TV.  She'd probably have no idea who Lara Croft is.  Darryl would have to explain it to her.
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,Waddles77,5,Wed Mar 4 03:52:32 2015 UTC,"wow, Louise was obsessed with breasts and milk tonight."
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,Eddie_Chester,28,Mon Mar 2 05:34:40 2015 UTC,"That was a direct reference to the Game of Thrones character Lysa Arryn, who in her first appearance (if I'm remembering it right) is seen breast feeding her 10 year old son."
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,furiousxgeorge,14,Mon Mar 2 06:35:22 2015 UTC,"Also, Dany breastfed the dragons in the books IIRC.  Don't think it made it into the show, maybe Louise really didn't watch, she read. :P"
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,addisonavenue,3,Mon Mar 2 20:00:18 2015 UTC,She has to have watched. Gene of the Unfarting's actions were parodying something that only happened in the television show. A few other things show it's clearly TV-based.
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,furiousxgeorge,2,Wed Mar 4 05:38:40 2015 UTC,"Reading the books would be easier for Louise to do, maybe not in terms of comprehension but in accessibility perhaps?"
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,Waddles77,7,Tue Mar 3 01:39:15 2015 UTC,"When the fire dies, Ser Jorah finds Daenerys, naked but alive and unburnt except for her hair, nursing two baby dragons, with a third draped across her shoulders.    http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Game_of_Thrones-Chapter_72"
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,AllureKnight,7,Mon Mar 2 20:47:23 2015 UTC,"okay, that helps explain it. I kept telling myself I was probably missing a bunch of in-jokes because I don't watch Game of Thrones"

BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,Lazymoth,6,Mon Mar 2 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"I know it is an unpopular opinion, but this one and the ones where kids write the stories for school have been my least favorite. Its just such a cliche sitcom theme. One step above the dreaded clip show."
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,furiousxgeorge,21,Mon Mar 2 03:59:05 2015 UTC,"I mean, what's wrong with it? It's a great mechanic when you think about it, it allows the characters to transcend rules of the show and show you how things would go in an alternate universe.  A clip show is a mean comparison; a clip show is zero work, maybe just a dubbing track over top of old footage. But an anthology with wildly different settings is more work than your typical episode- just think about how all the important characters in this one had not one, not two, but three entire specially-made designs just for their appearances in each short story, to say nothing of all the concept art that they would had to have went through before nailing down those designs, and the design of the backgrounds in all the scenes.  Personally, this episode had me in stitches... I appreciate Bob's Burgers a lot, but it's pretty rare that I laugh out loud more than a chuckle. But this episode just had tons of jokes that worked for me (Teddy and Mort in the Game of Thrones parody were just incredible.)"
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,tutubutt,5,Mon Mar 2 05:54:27 2015 UTC,Yup.  Cartoon characters generally always wear the same outfits for a reason.
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,ThomasJCarcetti,6,Mon Mar 2 08:35:20 2015 UTC,"The outfit design this episode was so amazingly intricate. Definitely a step up from Frond Files, which only had one story where every character wore a unique outfit to fit the scenario. I hope they make an anthology episode each season."
BobsBurgers,2xm1cq,balletboot,8,Mon Mar 2 19:58:47 2015 UTC,They're hilarious. The way they worked in teddy and Bob and scott bacula was great .  This  was better than frond storytime because Bob and Linda and teddy had parts.

BobsBurgers,2xlykw,chronicfireworks,8,Sun Mar 1 23:19:05 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Loren Bouchard mentioned the ""Working Girl"" was the fifth grade musical in an interview last summer.

BobsBurgers,2xlykw,hazzleby,4,Mon Mar 2 00:15:22 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the last episode established that Louise is in fourth grade. It's mentioned at some point when she's running for class president. I remember being really pleased they included her age.  Gene I don't think has ever been addressed. Personally, I peg him at 5th/6th. Probably fifth.   As someone else mentioned, Tina was part of the 7th/8th grade dance. So either one of those."
BobsBurgers,2xlykw,youreatowel69,2,Mon Mar 2 04:14:54 2015 UTC,On yeah you're right Louise is in fourth grade my mistake   They included her age?
BobsBurgers,2xlykw,numbero_3,3,Mon Mar 2 13:57:51 2015 UTC,Bob says their youngest child is 9 in the episode where Linda is doing the prenatal yoga. I am spacing on which one that is at the moment though.
BobsBurgers,2xlykw,Eddie_Chester,3,Mon Mar 2 23:40:49 2015 UTC,Louise is 9 years old
BobsBurgers,2xlykw,Eddie_Chester,2,Tue Mar 3 01:41:00 2015 UTC,"Millie is mentioned as being in fourth grade, Louise isn't, they have not been seen together in classes and Henry Haber entered who is probably about Tina's age."
BobsBurgers,2xlykw,Bawfuls,4,Mon Mar 2 16:41:16 2015 UTC,Millie and Louise are in the same class. Louise mentioned that Millie got to name the class chinchilla princess little piddles.
BobsBurgers,2xlykw,glass_hedgehog,2,Tue Mar 3 00:58:04 2015 UTC,Gene would be in 6th grade.

BobsBurgers,2xlykw,Rallysquirrel109,6,Mon Mar 2 02:03:05 2015 UTC,"""Working Girl"" was the 'sanctioned' Wagstaff school musical with all grades participating.  LB might have said that offhandedly in an interview but that doesn't make it definitive within the context of the show.  Gene is officially 11 years old so 6th grade is more likely."
BobsBurgers,2xlykw,digger_ex_pat,2,Mon Mar 2 02:25:57 2015 UTC,Isn't it odd they apparently go to a combined elementary & middle school?  Or is this more common than I realized?

BobsBurgers,2xg5a0,The_M0nk,12,Mon Mar 2 05:22:35 2015 UTC,The episode I envisioned is a young Louise with a stuffed bunny doing her usual devious stuff. The family hates the bunny but she and Louise are best pals. Through some comedy of errors it's ruined and Louise becomes lost. The family can't stand her like that and miss her spunk. Someone (I feel like it would be bob) comes up with making a hat using the bunny.

EDIT: I also don't think its time slot is anything to worry about.  Bob's will be like King of the Hill.   FOX will never treat it like a hit, but they'll keep it on the air for a long time."

BobsBurgers,2x514a,NicolasCageIsMyHero,3,Thu Feb 26 05:41:28 2015 UTC,"It's bad because that means ratings are lower than they had previously been.

Edit: also, if youre just starting the show from the first episode give it some time. It got mixed reviews first half of the season, it tried a little too hard to be shock humour. Like most tv comedies, it needed to find its footing.  Edit 2: the moment i fell in love with BB was the interaction between bob and louise in art crawl.  Pssst shut your mouth. Psssst shut you mouth, its art crawl. Psssst. Shut. Shut your mouth, art crawl"

They're not perfect obviously, but that would make for a pretty boring show. It just feels very genuine to me. They embrace each others quirkiness instead of humiliate each other for it.   Give it another shot, it took me more than a couple episodes to fall in love."
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,zoethezoologist,6,Mon Feb 23 18:08:39 2015 UTC,"Thats another thing i love. Bob and Linda are not a perfect couple. Linda loses her temper and Bob acts pretty spineless sometimes. So theyre pretty relateable. Theyre not Ricki and Lucy level dysfunctional, and theyre not morticia and mr. addams level initimate. But they do love and support each other and their kids and have a pretty healthy sex life. Theyre my tv inspired marriage goals!"
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,Lolnahnowaynope,6,Mon Feb 23 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"I'm only up to the fourth episode, so four more episodes won't hurt me."

BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,lampkyter,0,Mon Feb 23 22:39:53 2015 UTC,4 is on Netflix. 5 isn't. In the US at least

BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,tb03102,2,Tue Feb 24 00:35:58 2015 UTC,It took us a while to warm up to it. Love BB now.
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,babyblanka,6,Mon Feb 23 22:53:22 2015 UTC,Seriously. Told my husband we weren't having kids unless he could promise our family would be as awesome as the Belchers.
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,MrRoboface,10,Mon Feb 23 20:48:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know how far you are into the series, but around episode 8 of season 1 (Art Crawl) is where I think it really settles into what is now Bob's Burgers. At this point it gets good, and I mean my favourite show good.  One of the reasons I like it so much is because of how often the lines seem improvised, people talking over, it makes it seem like a real family.   If you're not up to Art Crawl, give the show a chance. Even watch one of the newer episodes."
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,Lolnahnowaynope,8,Mon Feb 23 19:03:08 2015 UTC,"I was hooked at tinas sweet 13 episode, but fell on love at art crawl"
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,quirkilyclumsy,5,Tue Feb 24 00:37:46 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I feel they found their groove at Sheesh! Cab, Bob? (S01E06). I replay that episode frequently on Netflix."
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,cyrilspaceman,7,Tue Feb 24 00:44:54 2015 UTC,"It has everything that shows up in the great later episodes. It's got multiple strong plot lines, great family interactions, a ridiculous musical number, absurd side characters. It is my favorite episodes."
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,vitsikany,3,Tue Feb 24 14:32:08 2015 UTC,"""Pulling down the pants of the night"" was the moment I realized that the show was just brilliant."

BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,Knife_Operator,3,Tue Feb 24 10:44:27 2015 UTC,"I'm only on episode four of season one, so I'll watch the first season. I'm not really sure if it's for me, so I'll just leave it where it is if I don't care for it."
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,poached-egg,6,Mon Feb 23 21:18:50 2015 UTC,"I don't get all the hype about Futurama. It's okay to be interested in things that other people aren't interested in, and vice versa."
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,quantum_sleep,2,Mon Feb 23 21:43:10 2015 UTC,"For me I never had Futarama hyped up. So I guess it's the fact that I went in knowing nothing of it, but with Bob's burgers I was told it was this amazing show, so I guess it is kind of my fault on that regard."
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,BeautifulLover,5,Mon Feb 23 21:55:01 2015 UTC,"I actually just finished watching Futurama, and I was thinking the same thing about the show. But looking back, the relationship between the characters in Futurama really made the show (along with off the wall references to other movies/shows.) I feel the same way about BB. You can tell by just the way the voice actors speak, that the show is all about the fun a family has together. Louise is crazy, Gene hams it up, Tina makes it awkward, and the dynamic between Bob and Linda really lights up their relationship (not to mentionthe off the wall humor.) Like the others have said, I would give it a bit longer if you haven't gotten far in the series. The longer you watch, the more invested you get in the family and their humor."
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,addisonavenue,3,Mon Feb 23 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"I'll have to finish the first season, but for me I don't think it will be able to fill the hole that Futarama left after it ended."
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,themonocledmenace,9,Mon Feb 23 21:17:38 2015 UTC,"Nor should it. You can't replace one child with another. They're different, and if you're looking for a show to replace Futurama, you won't. Even if you DID find something that was the same type of plot and dynamics, it'd just be a cheap rip off."
BobsBurgers,2wvqwq,redsox113,3,Mon Feb 23 21:52:30 2015 UTC,"I can point you out to certain episodes I like... Not every episode is a hit or even gives me a chuckle... Same way with the Simpsons.   My favorite are any of Aunt Gayles episodes. Also LINDA!, I love the twins and Tina, Louise... Gene has never made me laugh but some people like him."
BobsBurgers,2wskqm,ilikzim,9,Sun Feb 22 20:31:48 2015 UTC,"The scene which prompts this flashback is when he finds the guitar for the first time. He's excited to use it to confront his nemesis.  The flash back shows why they're enemies so it wouldn't make sense that he'd have the guitar then.    I'd assume while piecing together the episode they re-used animation and put it on a different backdrop, and didn't realize the guitar was there."
BobsBurgers,2wskqm,AdamDe27,1 point,Mon Feb 23 04:01:42 2015 UTC,Or maybe its a joke about how flakey his mind is that he just put it there like he always had it.

BobsBurgers,2wskqm,numbero_3,3,Sun Feb 22 21:00:46 2015 UTC,Did they do that on purpose?  A flashback to when he carried the guitar everywhere?

When I think I've picked the perfect song, someone else brings up one that's on par or even better!  I guess I will go w/ the classic ""Electric Love.""  ""Topsy"" is one of my top favorite episodes because when the curtain pulls back and the band joins the chorus in singing, don't laugh and I know I'm nuts, but I actually get goosebumps and tear-up a little.   I think it all stems from the fact that I have had that same reaction that Bob had when he realized that, wow... Gene IS talented!  When my son was in a play I helped him w/ lines.  He was 12 at the time and naturally goofy.  I knew he'd be ""good"" in the play because he was ""my baby.""  BUT... when that kid of mine came out on the stage and opened his mouth to speak... I was floored.  I could NOT believe it was the same kid.  I was impressed/awed... just like Bob.  I KNOW it's a cartoon, but the writers and actors UNDERSTOOD what it's like to a parent and realize their kid is much more than just ""their baby.""  Yep... ""Electric Love.""

BobsBurgers,2vbzg3,Uxyboy118,0,Mon Feb 9 19:48:43 2015 UTC,"What a waste, should've posted a gif instead of a jpg."

BobsBurgers,2v9uun,Eddie_Chester,34,Mon Feb 9 05:48:22 2015 UTC,Most of the characters designs have been tweaked and refined over the course of the 5 seasons to date.
BobsBurgers,2v9uun,Eddie_Chester,4,Mon Feb 9 06:13:17 2015 UTC,Teddy looks different to me too but...barely.  Who else has changed?
BobsBurgers,2v9uun,Eddie_Chester,32,Mon Feb 9 06:28:56 2015 UTC,"Bob:  There may have been some more subtle refinements since, but his mustache changed it's shape between the end of season 1 and the start of season 2.  In 1 it was a Groucho-esque rectangular shape.  Since season 2 it has a more natural looking taper toward the corners of his mouth.  His arms were originally quite short and now appear to be of a more natural length.  Louise: In the first couple of seasons there was a thing where Louise's right eye was noticeably bigger than her left.  Usually in cartoons when a character is drawn at a 3/4 front angle the eye closest to camera is drawn slightly larger to give a bit of dimension to the face.  With Louise it was usually the right eye no matter what the angle. That's not being done anymore.  It looks to me like they've defaulted to the eye-closest-to-camera rule.  Linda:  She had the same eye thing as Louise and the same arm thing as Bob.  Tina: It looks to me like there's been some tweaking of the relationship of her eyes/glasses to her nose.  She seems a little cuter and more appealing to me in the more recent episodes.    Hugo and Ron: Both were originally kind of flat and blobby (for lack of a better term) like most of the season 1 design.  They now appear more dimensional and structured.  Hugo has added a belt to his wardrobe when he's not being a nudist.  Andy and Ollie: They seem like the most noticeably changed to me.  It's still the same basic look but there's been a lot of refinement.  I remember them looking a little wall-eyed early on and I don't think they are any more.  They may have gotten slightly taller too.  Tammy: Besides going from brunette to blonde, her facial proportions look like they've been tweaked to make her more appealing.  There are probably other subtle refinements as well."
BobsBurgers,2v9uun,zozeba,4,Mon Feb 9 09:14:23 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I forgot about the eye size difference.  That was pretty noticeable in the beginning.  I actually preferred that, too.  I wish the animation style was still the same as the first season.  Particularly with Linda's movements, things are almost too smooth now.  But, that seems to be the way things go when your budget goes up."
BobsBurgers,2v9uun,the4thbelcherkid,2,Mon Feb 9 15:48:57 2015 UTC,"It just occurred to me that Bob's season 1 mustache was the exact same shape as a crinkle-cut french fry.  Meta.  I found the Louise/Linda eye-thing to be interesting but ultimately distracting.  It would also occasionally switch sides, and when you think about it, it has to be difficult to enforce a small aesymetrical detail like that all the way through the animation process."

BobsBurgers,2v8v4l,autowikibot,5,Mon Feb 9 14:52:31 2015 UTC,"Matching hypothesis:       The matching hypothesis (also known as the matching phenomenon) is derived from the discipline of social psychology and was first proposed by Elaine Hatfield and her colleagues in 1966,  which suggests why people become attracted to their partner. It claims that people are more likely to form and succeed in a committed relationship with someone who is equally socially desirable. This is often researched in the form of physical attraction.   If this leads you to think of all the successful couples in which the partners differ greatly in physical attractiveness, it is likely that the less attractive partner has compensating qualities to offer.  For instance, some men with wealth and status desire younger, more attractive women. Some women are more likely to overlook physical attractiveness for men who possess wealth and status.    It is also similar to some of the theorems outlined in Uncertainty Reduction Theory, from the post-positivist discipline of communication studies. These theorems include constructs of nonverbal expression, perceived similarity, liking, information seeking, and intimacy, and their correlations to one another.

There have been a couple of instances that suggest that Zeke is sweet on Tina and maybe at some point she'll come to see him as boyfriend material, but as Doc Brown reminds us, the future isn't written.

BobsBurgers,2uyui9,LikeADemonsWhisper,57,Fri Feb 6 08:31:30 2015 UTC,"I would disagree a little bit.  Bob wins in that his family is fiercely strong and loyal to each other, despite standard family in-fighting.  Bob does get the raw end a lot. Maybe even most of the time.  But there are snippets, like in Best Burger, he technically loses the burger competition, but then his chef idol comes to his restaurant at the end and Bob gets the validation he wants.  He also gets to take solice in the fact that his rival, Jimmy Pesto, is consistently TERRIBLE at making burgers.  His kids are constantly getting in trouble (besides Tina, whose maturity manifests in other ways) because they are ahead of the curve socially, enlightened beyond the level of their peers, albeit, still free spirited children.  Bob's suffering stems mainly from the contrast between what he really wants (a loving, loyal family who all work together in a burger place), and what society tells him he should have (a cappuccino maker or a frozen yogurt machine).  Certainly a good deal of Bob's bad luck is just that:  bad luck.  He never really catches a break, but many times, ""catching a break"", in this context, would mean fulfilling a personal desire of his, one that would not necessarily determine his overall happiness."
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,ElZilcho31415,8,Fri Feb 6 14:28:46 2015 UTC,"Bob wins in that his family is fiercely strong and loyal to each other, despite standard family in-fighting.   Pretty much this. Bob is a winner, regardless of what is going on, because his family is amazing, and they stick together like nobody's business. All of those other characters that make life difficult for Bob and his family are usually either (if you really look at it) sad and pathetic, or they wind up having really great qualities (in the case of repeat minor characters that later come back as integral parts of the storyline, having learned their own lesson of sorts).  Bob is a classic example of someone who doesn't have to ""win"" in the short-term because he's already won in the long term: by being a part of a family unit that loves each other."
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,osrud,2,Fri Feb 6 19:47:01 2015 UTC,"All of those other characters that make life difficult for Bob and his family are usually either (if you really look at it) sad and pathetic, or they wind up having really great qualities (in the case of repeat minor characters that later come back as integral parts of the storyline, having learned their own lesson of sorts).   For sure. Despite the fact that he's always at odds with Jimmy Pesto, Bob's clearly so much happier. Contrast his behavior with the way Bob is with his family. Remember when Jimmy says to Andy and Ollie ""Last chance to earn my love, boys!""? Oh my God. I laughed so hard and couldn't decide if I should feel bad for laughing or not. Anyway. My point is, how sad for that family. Bob, yeah, he *is * kind of a down-on-his-luck guy but he also comes across as pretty happy most episodes."
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,Buttercupsman,25,Mon Feb 9 07:52:20 2015 UTC,"I actually agree, for once it would be good to see him get what he really deserves for working as hard as he does. I wouldn't however go so far as to say I'm going to stop watch because of that, because what I feel this show, as opposed to other cartoon shows, does really well is showing a good and loving family. And they do a really good job at keeping it kinda realistic, I mean you can see why they stay with each other. Ultimately I agree with you, they really need to give Bob one moment of bliss, but they show is still the best in my mind :)"
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,Sveenee,41,Fri Feb 6 12:52:22 2015 UTC,"I have another thought about this. Bob has caught a break. He owns his own restaurant and is able to get by. He lives by his own rules. His family allows him to live this dream. Sure he's not rich but he manages to keep his business afloat.   So in return, he has to help his family live their dreams and follow their passions. Linda ' s goofy singing and theatrics, Gene's music, Tina ' s friend fiction,  and Louise ' s anarchy are all what they are passionate about. Bob just chose a dream that was practical."

BobsBurgers,2uyui9,addisonavenue,11,Sat Feb 7 20:07:15 2015 UTC,"A lot of comedies have those characters that receive the brunt of the harshness of life. He is the Everyman struggling to keep his family and business afloat in difficult modern times. He takes the abuse because he is the patriarch and it is his responsibility as a husband and parent to support his family. In that capacity it's funny to level all of the struggles of life against him. The show would lose some of its life if those struggles were passed on to his pre-teen children.   Plus it's a cartoon and it's funny. Also please watch Home Movies, an earlier incarnation of Loren Bouchard and H Jon Benjamin being funny."
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,osrud,8,Fri Feb 6 15:14:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think its a pretty good depiction of real life.  You loose more times than you win.  Also as was pointed out else where in the comments, Bob has won.  On top of the few times he's come out on top, if just barely, he has a store that stays afloat, the life he wants to lead, and a family that loves him.  He's doing a hell of a lot better than some people.  Sure he's not the karma Houdini that Homer, Peter, and Stan are, but he's real and thats enough.  Besides he wins a lot more often in his side job as the Duchess."
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,oonniioonn,6,Fri Feb 6 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"As some others have said, Bob has what really counts.  Look at his main rival, Jimmy Pesto. Sure, Jimmy Pesto has a more successful business. But its been hinted or explicitly said several times that his food is garbage. And he can't make burgers, so he can't take Bob's business away from him. Also, despite all the silliness, Bob's kids love him, and vice versa. Jimmy Jr. at least has a strained relationship with his father, since Jimmy Pesto doesn't approve of his dancing. Andy and Ollie, as cute and oblivious as they are, apparently don't have his love. Add to that that he's divorced and needs to see prostitutes. He has a broken family.  Bob also has the only thing that his other rival (Hugo) wants, Linda. And he is always able to overcome Hugo's bullshit when Hugo slaps some weird sticker or poster in Bob's window (such as the handwashing one).  Regarding Fischoeder who isn't really an ""enemy"" per se, Bob was able to keep his lease by proving how good his burger was to him. He also beat him in Rock Paper Scissors, another time where Bob wins.  So, not everything goes perfectly for Bob, but in the end, I think he is perfectly content with where he stands in life. He's got a loving family, two pretty close friends/customers, and knows he makes good food."

It's such a point of pride for him that he uses fresh ingredients, and you can tell cooking is something he just really loves doing. The show does an amazing job at showing how much he loves it."
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,bettorworse,11,Mon Feb 9 08:07:40 2015 UTC,"Hell, in the most recent episode he had to put up with shit from Louise who I felt was just unrelentingly selfish that episode.   I actually thought that was amazingly written. It's a nine-year-old girl whose dad is doing something she loathes more than almost anything, and doesn't seem to think it's as big a deal as she does. And her inability to convey that sentiment effectively is incredibly frustrating to her. It immediately evoked childhood images of my parents doing the same thing -- parents are always doing shit their kids don't like to some extent or another but every now and then there's this thing they really really don't like, and yet they're unrelenting as ever. I understood fully."
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,SayceGards,0,Fri Feb 6 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"Well, this take makes sense. At least you're just trying to explain Louise's behavior and not justifying it like others here."

Unless I missed one, you're talking about the Logan/Gardening episode - sure, Linda tried to comprise and so did Louise for a good portion of the episode. But Logan and his mother made their lives unbearable at the restaurant. What was Bob doing during this time? He was gardening.  It's quite the perfect example of having your cake and eating it too. Bob settled this arrangement that would make his family completely miserable while not actually doing anything to help. You can't shoehorn people in a situation, especially if the return of that situation will not benefit them even in the slightest.  I mean, would you hurt someone so that someone else would give you something? Because that was basically the whole point of the episode."

BobsBurgers,2uyui9,Screwbit,3,Fri Feb 6 19:16:43 2015 UTC,"I would agree overall, with a slight caveat: The restaurant seems to have been doing better financially in the second half of season 4 and in what we've seen so far in season 5. After Bob comes in 2nd in the burger cook-off, there is a line down the block. When the conflict in the episode is centered around the community garden, you don't hear Bob complain about money or worry that a check has bounced. Yes, Bob hasn't ever come out clearly on top in any episode, but I see a loosening of tension around money, which opens up their universe to the different kinds of conflicts that life can creatively throw at you without the potential to destabilize your whole life/leave you out of work or homeless. I hope to see Bob win big someday, but if he does too well for too long, he won't be as funny :)"
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,theycallmeO,3,Fri Feb 6 19:09:27 2015 UTC,"I agree that Bob doesn't have it easy but he does get some breaks.  In the first episode -Human flesh- after being persecuted by most of the town, he ends up with a bus load of people willing to pay $50 for a human flesh burger.   He also ended up with a designer bathroom, although it's not clear if they resolved the brown water issue.   In the end he always has his family's unconventional love and support. I find this to be my favourite part of this show."
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,Baseball_dusty,2,Sun Feb 8 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"If he wins (big that is, he does has some small victories) he'd become successful and could afford to hire people other than his family to work in the restaurant.   Then they could get a place that wasn't an apartment about above the restaurant. Then it'd be a different show."
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,VALIS666,2,Fri Feb 6 18:49:31 2015 UTC,It seems like you're legitimately upset for Bob. If you aren't having fun with the show and enjoying it then you're watching it the wrong way.
BobsBurgers,2uyui9,addisonavenue,2,Sat Feb 7 02:11:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. It's a fantastic show, but Bob is becoming a bit of a sad sack character. It would be nice if they could step a little farther away from the ""Bob always loses"" formula."

BobsBurgers,2une1c,theduckmanz,9,Wed Feb 4 14:11:27 2015 UTC,"In ""Sheesh! Cab, Bob?"", the song that plays over the montage of Bob driving the cab is called ""Lifting Up The Skirt Of The Night"", but it's a clear parody of Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street"". As such, when you have the subtitles turned on on Netflix, the lyrics to Womack's original song appear over the singing of the parody."

The scene with the kids climbing into bed with Linda after Bob wakes up was so adorable and reminded me of being a kid myself."

Compared to the shows that air around it, one of which has been on the air for a gazillion years, and one that has been on since (approximately) the turn of the century. Neither of which are very good very often any longer.  BBs has made HUGE inroads in a very short period of time, though. But it still is a bit of a 'niche' show and I think that's just fine."

Even her bunny ears make her look a bit like some sort of kidrobot arttoy.  From her room, Louise seems to be fond of Japanese pop culture and art toys.  It would be interesting to explore this side of her one day I think: maybe demanding rare collectors toys in future epsiodes, and baffling the people who give it to her when she simply likes that limited edition Ninja Lava Angel Cat action figure posing it in her room, rather then playing with it."

The conflicts between Louise & Linda and Logan & Cynthia was great material. I personally loved the song they did for this episode, catchy and funny.  I also really liked the comeback of Bob having full on conversations with inanimate things, very funny.  And the quotes, my goodness, I want to put them all down, but here's a few I really liked:   ""Do what you gotta do Bobby, if you have to sleep with her to get in it's okay.""     ""You did it you old son of a bitch!""     ""You don't know which plot is mine Louise.""  ""Is it the one with the paper plate sign that says 'Bob's Beauties'?""   Another great episode!

BobsBurgers,2tnthi,AstorSapolsky,9,Tue Jan 27 18:26:14 2015 UTC,"I thought the conflicts were forced. There was legitimate conflict between Louise and Logan but the Linda and Synthia conflict was out of place. Helicopter parenting is annoying, but why does Linda have to turn it up to ten just because someone brought tea? She got actual fodder when reading over Synthia's shoulder at the end but that was after it had already escalated.  The episode has all the problems of ""Family Fracas"" where they're super mean to Bob for no reason. It seems like every time he wants to have a mild amount of happiness he has to be crucified for his minor selfishness whereas everybody else gets what they want (e.g. Louise nearly killing Tina just to get revenge against her Edison-loving Teacher).  I feel like they kick him while he's down because he's the father in an animated family sitcom, but I'm really not feeling the whole ""Bob's enjoying himself with minor inconvenience to the family, let's throw in a pseudo-connection at the end of the episode where he realizes he's been selfish."" The whole ""babies"" thing at the end was, again, contrived.  Edit: and I can't believe I'm the only one who seems to think this way. There were some fantastic lines/delivery, and a great song, but the ending was enough to bring this down to the worst episode of an amazing season."
BobsBurgers,2tnthi,addisonavenue,10,Wed Jan 28 03:06:32 2015 UTC,"You have to remember, Louise is nine. She lacks a lot of perspective and doesn't understand how her actions impact other people before it's too late (like Topsy, and Fort Night). She's also almost completely impulse driven, and she puts a lot of stock into the restaurant and how it ties into her idea of family and territory (Carpe Museum, Bed and Breakfast).  If the conflict between her and Bob felt forced, I think it's because she doesn't often reveal how much the restaurant means to her, so it's something the audience often forgets, meaning it takes awhile for that punch to land.  I do agree though, that the immediate conflict between Cynthia and Linda was a bit too bow tied, especially going right off the bat. I would've preferred a touch more build up to them reigniting that flame, especially after the events of Mother Daughter Laser Razor."

BobsBurgers,2tnthi,poppy-picklesticks,28,Mon Jan 26 04:22:26 2015 UTC,"That would have been a great ending for the episode I think.   The family scraped together some crappy windowboxes and empty pots (and made a few themselves out of things like empty crates and oil drums) for Bob to cheer him up, because they realised at the end of the day, Bob asks for very little out of anyone, and they didn't want to take one of the few things that he wants away from him."
BobsBurgers,2tnthi,lotsoftuna,10,Mon Jan 26 16:41:09 2015 UTC,"That would've been an amazing ending, but I like the end that they did with the garden on the ledge falling off, pretty funny."

BobsBurgers,2tnthi,Baseball_dusty,2,Thu Jan 29 21:21:03 2015 UTC,The show is doing such a great job of using continuity and building on it.   Its golden age simpsons level quality right now.
BobsBurgers,2tnthi,pythons404,4,Tue Feb 3 01:19:14 2015 UTC,"Loved so many things about this episode! Love seeing Bob happy, happens rarely so when it does it's a nice change of pace. Gene acting a bit more masculine was a good touch as well, would have liked if it led him into a bit more conflict with louise and tina but the small bits of character development are what I love about this show."

With a good local beer selection.   If you come in Spring/ early summer I would go to the Dushanbe Tea House, it has an absolutely gorgeous patio and a good menu.  Frasca is a wonderful experience. It's fairly expensive but they have a great Monday Tasting Menu that's reasonably priced.   Bonus places: Tee and Cakes on 14th for coffee and baked goods, Pizza Colore on Pearl Street Mall, and Curry and Kebob on 28th, all great.

BobsBurgers,2tdub8,guiri-girl,2,Mon Jan 26 15:48:35 2015 UTC,That was a pretty funny revelation.
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,illsmosisyou,15,Mon Jan 26 16:09:26 2015 UTC,"I love Tina, but Louise has that perfect combination of ""cold-blooded ax murderer"" and lovable little girl."
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,wattsghost,15,Fri Jan 23 13:58:50 2015 UTC,"I LOVE Andy and Ollie. They are just hilarious, and their bond is so sweet. I think I knew they were my favourites in the episode where they were both trying to carry each other across the road."
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,jazziibee,13,Fri Jan 23 16:41:58 2015 UTC,"Because she is a smart, strong, sensual woman"
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,veronica_palmer,12,Fri Jan 23 09:27:33 2015 UTC,"My favorite is constantly switching between Gene and Louise. Gene is hilarious and The OT is one of my favorite episodes, but Gene's episodes are either remarkable or regrettable. Louise's episodes are consistently good and normally show character growth - something Gene's episodes typically lack."
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,marcelineofooo,33,Fri Jan 23 12:55:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's Gene. My GF's is Louise -- there's a slightly terrifying hero complex at work there. I like Gene because I never know what he's going to do next. He's easily the least predictable of all the family members. Plus, I've always preferred the side plots to the main story in animated comedy (from The Simpsons, on to Drawn Together, American Dad, and Futurama) these storylines are where Gene really shines."
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,Telodzrum,10,Fri Jan 23 08:02:59 2015 UTC,"I find Gene hilarious too, but I dislike how most of his role is just to deliver one liners."
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,Tarkan7,6,Fri Jan 23 14:11:13 2015 UTC,That's why the toilet episode is so wonderful - Gene actually gets to be a character.
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,illiterature,1 point,Fri Jan 23 19:26:00 2015 UTC,"In a way they kinda shot themselves in the foot there; O.T was so good, every Gene spotlight since has kinda fell flat."
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,addisonavenue,2,Mon Jan 26 10:19:23 2015 UTC,"Really? I think Gene is the most predictable and pretty shallow as a character, most of his lines are just something gross or a quick, surprising response to another character."

BobsBurgers,2tdub8,slowestmojo,12,Fri Jan 23 17:18:03 2015 UTC,Louise all the way. She won me over with the first episode I watched. Threatening to cut off an older kid's ears just makes her my hero. Just the right amount of kid psychopath without being too offensive or fucked up.
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,PM_ME_YOUR_BURDENS,3,Fri Jan 23 15:16:33 2015 UTC,That was my very favorite Louise episode.

BobsBurgers,2tdub8,Jekyllhyde,10,Fri Jan 23 14:17:34 2015 UTC,It's still Tina. I'm still that awkward preteen at heart so I get her. I just wish I had the courage that she does.
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,amodernbird,11,Fri Jan 23 15:01:03 2015 UTC,Everyone wants to think they're a Louise but deep down inside they're really Tinas.

BobsBurgers,2tdub8,cookiepusss,5,Fri Jan 23 16:37:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm one of the few people who are just annoyed by (but still love) Tina. It's all about Louise for me. She's hilarious, as stated earlier has the qualities of an ax murderer, and just pure shock value. Plus it's just awesome how much she really loves Bob but tries to hide it."
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,Igarcia6286,9,Fri Jan 23 15:10:22 2015 UTC,"""Oh my god. Am I your hero?!"" ""What? Ugh, sick!""  Is one of my favorite Bob/Louise interactions. Their relationship is one of my favorite things on the show!"

BobsBurgers,2tdub8,Igarcia6286,6,Fri Jan 23 18:09:25 2015 UTC,"I really like the support cast. Darryl, Andy and Ollie and Gail are all excellent characters on there own."

BobsBurgers,2tdub8,_Bumble_Bee_Tuna_,6,Fri Jan 23 17:19:40 2015 UTC,Actually Louise has always been my favorite. I have a soft spot for tiny little psychopaths.
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,cookiepusss,6,Fri Jan 23 16:37:12 2015 UTC,Teddy. Because he is just hysterical. Gene too.
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,bofip,4,Fri Jan 23 18:08:51 2015 UTC,Zeke! I don't have reasons!
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,Ba713,7,Fri Jan 23 17:53:53 2015 UTC,"wrong!  teddy, bob, gene, THEN tina."
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,leonryan,3,Fri Jan 23 08:21:13 2015 UTC,"Louise is my favorite because I wish I was more like her, but I feel like Tina is more like myself."
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,MistressofTea,3,Fri Jan 23 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"I like the school social worker.  Teddy is by far the funniest. The health inspectors are something else. Favorite is Bob. Someone articulated earlier, he makes me feel comfortable. He is a dad. Homer , Hank Hill, Peter non of those dad's are realistic"
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,chipbitbatcat,3,Tue Jan 27 05:28:43 2015 UTC,Because I too wish to know about the mergina.
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,Titdick_McAnusbutts,3,Fri Jan 23 20:50:46 2015 UTC,Aunt Gayle   She's pretty much adult Tina.
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,wendytheroo,3,Sat Jan 24 20:55:26 2015 UTC,"Bob - Bob just seems like such a good dad. He loves and accepts his kids for who they are, and the weird antics they get themselves into. I also love that you can see he's a person outside of his role as father on the show. He has his passions, he fucks things up, he's a total dork, he does things that you think you would grow out of by the time that you're a parent. His humor is alternately dry and cheesey. It's just kind of oddly comforting, his character, and kind of makes me hope to find my own Bob one day.  Louise - love her just because she's a criminal mastermind stuck in the body of a 7 year old.  Mr. Fishoeder - he's just such a character. He wears an all-white suit with a white eyepatch, he cultivates a taste in batshit crazy women, he's sly and undermining but not overly maliciously so and though he's shady as fuck, he still has a pretty good heart, considering the lengths he goes through for his brother and the fact that he hasn't evicted Bob and his family yet.  Andy & Olly - every scene with them is just kind of hilarious. They love each other a lot and you can see the weird consequences of that level of devotion."
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,AutomateAllTheThings,4,Mon Jan 26 18:34:11 2015 UTC,Because butts.
BobsBurgers,2tdub8,MuffinPuff,2,Fri Jan 23 07:47:18 2015 UTC,I think I love them all equally.

BobsBurgers,2tdub8,cookieguyster,2,Fri Jan 23 16:58:58 2015 UTC,"Tina's great, it just oddly irks me when people who aren't even fans of the show obsess over Tina because she's ""omg so...like..relatable. she's sooo awkward...just like meeee"" She's so much more."

BobsBurgers,2t6k3k,PuffyAssCuteAssCloud,12,Thu Jan 22 04:14:25 2015 UTC,Linda's voice doesn't really sound like it's being voiced by a woman. Definitely sounds like a guy doing an impression of a woman so it makes sense.
BobsBurgers,2t6k3k,UOUPv2,-22,Thu Jan 22 05:05:26 2015 UTC,"It's weird to me that like 90% of the female characters are played by men.

I side with the producers on that one..."

BobsBurgers,2t8cir,mlozano88,6,Thu Jan 22 00:11:55 2015 UTC,"I love all of them, but it's really close for me with the girls. Louise is who I wanted to be as a kid. Tina is, to an extent, who I was. Linda is my favorite.   Linda is how I want to be as an adult woman. A good wife who stands by her husband and pushes him to accomplish his dreams, even if she sacrifices her own in the process. She's also silly, quirky, and hilarious. The songs she creates out of nothing make me laugh every time. (I have Where is Harry Truman as my ringtone right now.)   She's a good role model for the 20-somethings like myself. I realize it's a cartoon, but it's also true to life in its own way.   It's still so hard to choose, even after all that. That's why I love this show. Every character has such great moments."
BobsBurgers,2t8cir,Slow_It_Down,5,Fri Jan 23 02:15:27 2015 UTC,"I really like Bob.  I know he's supposed to always be the straight man, somewhat neutral and oft defeated, but he's a surprisingly good, compassionate father, somewhat bewildered by the chaos that regularly unfolds around him. As I would be.  Also he makes little voices for inanimate objects sometimes. As I do."
BobsBurgers,2t8cir,_Burgers_,3,Sat Jan 24 03:12:39 2015 UTC,"I think that this is a tough question. The characters are so well thought out and each have a little ""something"" to them that makes them relatable.  I would have to say Tina. She is going through puberty which is the worst time ever, but she manages to stay true to herself. She is positive, offers advice, and seems to generally care. She is always put down but still sees herself as beautiful, and I admire that about her.   And I have a slight crush on Dan Mintz..."
BobsBurgers,2t8cir,Flying-wombat,1 point,Thu Jan 22 15:49:32 2015 UTC,I re-watched the episode of the dinner party and my love for Tina grew like ten fold. When Louise is yelling at her before the show. Man I couldn't stop laughing the entire time!
BobsBurgers,2t8cir,chanselman,2,Thu Jan 22 19:09:46 2015 UTC,"It's sooooo hard to choose, but I'd probably say Louise.  She's a budding sociopath who manipulates everyone around her and creates conflict whenever and wherever she can, but still manages to be adorable."
BobsBurgers,2t8cir,C1K3,2,Fri Jan 23 04:15:30 2015 UTC,I really like Linda. The times that she almost pukes really crack me up. And what to say about when she makes up songs!
BobsBurgers,2t8cir,wereux,2,Fri Jan 23 04:26:24 2015 UTC,ZEKE!  And Gene is my favorite Belcher.
BobsBurgers,2t8cir,Screwbit,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:55:14 2015 UTC,"Linda is my favourite. She's loving, wacky, positive about everything. She says some of the funniest jokes on the show, and her songs always kick ass. She's not the usual boring sitcom wife who is just perpetually rolling her eyes at her husband, but rather the two of them support each other, and their relationship is rock solid. She loves her kids, but motherhood is not all that summarizes Linda. Is it a big part? Surely, as the show is centered around the family. But Linda is a funny, positive, sometimes easily angered woman with a love of wine and Tom Selleck and her husband, who just so happens to also be a mother.  It makes me a tiny bit sad when people say she's their least favourite just because she's so amazing."
BobsBurgers,2t3wlb,gin_gibb,23,Tue Jan 20 23:30:58 2015 UTC,Why leave Gene out? All the Belcher kids are awesome. Not sure how anyone can pick 2 favorites and leave the 3rd out. Absurd.

BobsBurgers,2t5ysx,krizriktr,1 point,Wed Jan 21 12:43:09 2015 UTC,"They did this once about a year and a half ago in Madison, WI. It was a great show and I encourage all fans to check it out. They started out with each of the voice actors doing a bit of standup.  It was interesting to see them perform in other ways.  It ended with a table read and some Q&A.  the table read was great.  They did about 1/3 of an upcoming show before it aired."

If you buy them through the link I posted, they're $52.88.  After fees the 2 tickets were about $120.  If I bought them through ticketmaster, they easily would've tacked on around $16 in fees per ticket taking the total to $153.  Got really good seats in the 12th row!"

I saw the announcement and I love the show but I kind of want to know what the general idea is before I buy tickets.   When Trailer Park Boys did their live show tour it ended up on Netflix anyway and I didn't think it was that great, so I'm hesitant."
BobsBurgers,2t2auf,Itsfineiswear,2,Tue Jan 20 20:41:16 2015 UTC,"I found an article that was pretty buried about last year's tour.  Apparently it was just what I thought--A live table read, Q&A, some stand up from the actors on the show, and a sneak peek at future episodes :)  Probably buying tickets when they go on sale.  Closest place for me is the Warner Theater, and my husband and I saw Alton Brown there a couple months ago.  It was a nice place where it fit quite a few people, but small enough that you didn't necessarily need help seeing everything."

BobsBurgers,2szwcf,Donutsndrums,2,Tue Jan 20 07:44:16 2015 UTC,"Thats awesome! I'm a guitarist/electronic engineer, its always cool to to talk to other musicians.  Setup:  Logic Pro X for Mac  Scarlett 2i2 Interface (works awesomely with logic)  Gibson Les Paul Fender Telecaster  Tenor Ukelele (Can't remember the brand)  Sometimes I use a Mesa Triple Rectifier or an Orange Tiny Terror but for this song I just used Logic to run the amps for the guitar lines!   Process: Basically for this one, I first recorded a blurb of the ukulele and did a basic drum beat off of that. Then from there I added the main rhythm guitar on top of that that. Then scrap the original uke lines and really perfect them. (I find it easier to play on top of drums than just a metronome). From there I added bass, the lead guitar lines, trumpets and other brass, and just fine tuning the EQs and compressors."
