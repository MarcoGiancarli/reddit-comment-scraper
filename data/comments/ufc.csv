ufc,3e1uyk,jayden35,6,Tue Jul 21 08:51:57 2015 UTC,"Kind of a misleading title/headline. I understand why they word it that way, to try and get the clicks, but if you read the article you can understand what TJ meant.  I think if you ask anyone who's at the top of their division, especially a weight class that's only one away from Conor's, if they'd fight a catchweight match or an exhibition match or whatever, of course they're going to give you that answer.  Then you add in that TJ and Mendes are in the same camp, and that Faber and Conor have had friction prior to the interim fight, and no shit he's going to say he'd like to take a shot at him.  All that aside, this would be an AWESOME fight if they could get within a couple pounds of each other. Conor is probably too big for TJ, but it'd be a fucking awesome match up and I'd love to see what TJ could do against Conor standing up. Dude can bang way better than Mendes, and it'd be really interesting to see Conor put up against someone with truly world class striking. (I know he will against Aldo if they ever fight, obviously.)"
ufc,3e1uyk,PreSchoolGGW,2,Tue Jul 21 12:54:11 2015 UTC,"McGregor is the Leprechaun at the end of the rainbow with a big pot of gold and by God, just about every other UFC fighter has eyes filled with dollar signs for this guy.   With the exception of Edgar who could give him a good fight, everyone else calling McGregor out would get absolutely destroyed."
ufc,3e1uyk,EoinMcLove,3,Tue Jul 21 13:53:15 2015 UTC,Am I wrong in the sense that I rate Mendes higher than Frankie? Being Irish I'm a massive conor fan so when aldo pulled out I was hoping they'd give Frankie the fight because I thought he'd be a better ( and effectively easier) fight for conor.
ufc,3e1uyk,Legolas90,2,Tue Jul 21 17:41:29 2015 UTC,"No, I'd actually agree with you. I thought Mendes would be by far the toughest opponent in the division for McGregor and was worried he was fighting him too soon. I think being the champ changes fighters and makes them a hell of a lot better, so a defence against Mendes would have been the ideal route.  I don't think Edgar is as capable of getting McGregor down as often as Mendes was, but Chads problem is despite being a great wrestler, he doesn't have a whole load of tricks in his book to really do damage whilst he has you down there.  I think McGregor has had his toughest featherweight fight. I don't think he'll fight Mendes again, I think he'll fight Aldo for undisputed champion and win (probably in either Vegas or Texas) and then he'll have a defence against Edgar, probably in a Dublin stadium and then he'll vacate and move up to lightweight. That's my hunch anyway."
ufc,3e1uyk,EoinMcLove,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:14 2015 UTC,"Really? You know that for a fact? Every fighter loses, and every fighter gets knocked out. And McGregor will too. And I almost guarantee it will be against someone you're positive would get absolutely destroyed."
ufc,3e1uyk,unsubsamantix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:00:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they definitely used click bait on this one. Dillashaw wouldn't be the first team Alpha male member (after Mendes) to get a shot a McGregor. Plus, Dillashaw has a whole division to clear first."

ufc,3e1uyk,Def-not-a-throwaway,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:23:07 2015 UTC,"Conor is very big for his weight class.  TJ would look like Little Mac out there.  I wish it weren't the case because that would be one hell of an entertaining fight, but I don't think TJ has the size to deal with Conor and it would be pretty one sided imo."
ufc,3e24ho,Slayerface,5,Tue Jul 21 11:02:24 2015 UTC,"Fucking stupid.  Lets promote the shit outa this $10 a month service, then make it as limp dicked at possible."
ufc,3e24ho,Hoooooooar,2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:16 2015 UTC,exactly how I feel. Every non PPV event should be on there and fully available either live during the event or the day after regardless of your geographical location.  It sucks I have to pay my cable provider for FoxSports1 just to get the free fights I should be getting on FightPass.
ufc,3e24ho,warbeats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:07:31 2015 UTC,So much potential too... Shit I'd pay 20 dollars if it let me watch all of the fights the day after the event. I'm so tired of having to find out how I can watch the upcoming fights

ufc,3e24ho,warbeats,2,Tue Jul 21 23:15:02 2015 UTC,Bisping Vs. Leites is blocked now too even though I watched that the day before yesterday. What's the point of on demand if it's only available for a couple of days right after the live event?
ufc,3e24ho,Jacrjames,2,Tue Jul 21 11:04:30 2015 UTC,I don't think either of those events were supposed to be available in the US in the first place. Somebody fucked up and we had access to them. The blackout restrictions due to the Fox deal still suck though.
ufc,3e24ho,warbeats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:22 2015 UTC,If this is true how can they ask you to pay for an undetermined selection of fight night events that don't get signed off to a network
ufc,3e24ho,Jacrjames,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"I purchsed a year of FightPass outright. When it comes up for renewal, I will not continue unless they can make some dramatic changes and improvements. Specifically - show ALL fights live and on demand except for PPV events. There should be no geographic restrictions if I am paying the same as someone else in another country.  FWIW, you can use a proxy to connect to FightPass from a different region and it works, but UFC detects this and (I believe) will ""lock out"" your account when you connect again from the US. You can simply go through the procedure to unlock (similar to forget password) and it's all good but it's a hassle."
ufc,3e24ho,warbeats,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:56 2015 UTC,its all to do with the deals they make with the major cable providers right? They sell exclusive rights to companies like Foxtel in Australia. I don't understand why the UFC doesn't just cut the middle man and broadcast exclusively through their website?!!!!!
ufc,3e24ho,learningstuf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"I believe you are correct. I understand why they might not want FightPass to show something that might appear on say FoxSports1. FS1 needs the advertisers dollars because they bought the rights to show it. Fair enough...  ...Until the next day. After the event is over, FSN won't be showing it again until it's on some late night UFC Reloaded or something. At this point it should available to all FightPass subscribers.    IMHO of course."
ufc,3e24ho,Trabjerg,2,Tue Jul 21 22:17:01 2015 UTC,"not good enough! get rid of the cable deal! I'm not saying people with cable are stupid, they're just complacent.

Not saying it wouldnt sell at all, it'd probably be fine, but its not like Brock Lesnar coming to the UFC or anything. He has 0 credentials, 0 experience ... and I had never even heard of him (although apparently he was really popular) until the headlines of him signing with the UFC."

Seriously, what the fuck is DC going to do to jones? Out strike him? Not a chance in hell, especially with that reach advantage, I'm sure he'll win by taking him down and wrestling him... oh wait! He can't do that either!"

ufc,3drgyr,TheMManhunter,9,Sun Jul 19 16:12:47 2015 UTC,Why does Gus get a title shot?   I know he is probably the best guy in the division right now but should you really get a shot after losing to the last title contender by first round stoppage?
ufc,3drgyr,godzirrah,8,Sat Jul 18 23:44:29 2015 UTC,"because jones will be back for the winner, either way it will be a huge rematch"
ufc,3drgyr,Demaculus,2,Sun Jul 19 01:25:37 2015 UTC,^ This more than anything.
ufc,3drgyr,PacificVIking,2,Sun Jul 19 01:50:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but LHW is a very thin division at the moment, Gus got caught, Johnson didn't out work him, he didn't prove he was the more technical fighter (not to take anything away from him) he only showed he has knockout power.  Everyone gets caught sometimes, and had Jones not fucked his life up this fight would unquestionably the right one.   For a moment lets forget that DC is champ, let's pretend JBJ was never stripped, and defeated Johnson.  DC vs. Gus as a title eliminator is perfect, many believe, though I am not among them (but I can certainly understand why they do), that Gus should have won his first matchup with Jones.  DC has only lost to Bones. A title eliminator would just make sense.  The other argument is for putting Ryan Bader in. I feel this guy gets a bad rap and is under if not straight disrespected. He has a solid string of wins, and not all of them have been gimmies, OSP and Davis aren't garbage fighters by any stretch.   He's not the most gifted of all fighters, but he works extremely hard, he deserves a top three fight. He's on a four bout win streak, with two wins coming against 2 guys who are in the top 10, and one arguably in the top 5 at LHW.  But as its DC vs. AG. Lets have AJ vs RB as part of the undercard."
ufc,3drgyr,TheMManhunter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:36:07 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with any of your points, I just get a little jaded seeing guys get title shots after coming off loses.   Sonnen, Edgar, Diaz and even d.c. although at least he lost to the champ and that same champ was stripped."
ufc,3drgyr,Nogarda,4,Sun Jul 19 02:58:38 2015 UTC,This'll either be a quick 1st rounder for DC or a 5 round war.
ufc,3drgyr,f-a-p,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:57:39 2015 UTC,"My hunch is DC will simply turn it into a quick wrestling match, and submission will come in the 1st."
ufc,3drgyr,bigfishbloom,2,Sun Jul 19 05:29:54 2015 UTC,Win/Win for UFC. DC wins - rematch of a 800K buy show. AG wins - rematch of the greatest light heavyweight fight in history
ufc,3drgyr,Yankfan54,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:45:45 2015 UTC,DC needs to bring this to the ground. Gus is a much bigger Guy with a lot longer of a reach. So standing won't work for DC
ufc,3drgyr,LordMuffington,4,Sat Jul 18 19:31:46 2015 UTC,You realise that DC fought at heavyweight for 5 years? And that he KO'd Bigfoot? Right?
ufc,3drgyr,crazzynez,3,Sat Jul 18 22:53:53 2015 UTC,thats exactly what people were saying before his fight vs jones and he ended up looking like a midget trying to take down a giant
ufc,3drgyr,PreSchoolGGW,-1,Sun Jul 19 09:02:03 2015 UTC,"Really hope Gus beats the shit out of DC. I fucking hate DC and his stupid fat face.  Along the lines of a more rational approach to the fight, though, in all honesty DC will probably gameplan to take DC to the ground and out-wrestle/submit him.  I don't see the fight going five rounds. Either DC takes him down until Gus can't deal with it any longer and gets submitted, or Gus works his ass off on takedown defense, has answers for DC's wrestling and stops him, and then pounds him into dust."
ufc,3drgyr,jaretok,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:39:17 2015 UTC,"Gus is legit. I thought he beat Jones. He took Jones down, and Jones had a lot of trouble returning the favor. Meanwhile Jones was rag dolling DC. He's a huge light heavyweight too, whereas DC is very compact. I wouldn't count Gus out for a second."
ufc,3drgyr,PreSchoolGGW,6,Sat Jul 18 22:36:46 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. I'd love to see Gus win, honestly I felt Rumble got slightly lucky catching him the way he did."

ufc,3dsaw9,TheMManhunter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:49:25 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it will come down almost exclusively to the opponents.  Does he want low-pressure, high-payday fights? Then Bellator is the easy bet. I'm confident Coker can scrounge together enough of that Viacom money to make a Fedor/Randy Couture ""fun fight"" happen, and then there's always Kimbo and Tito. Yeah, yeah, weight classes…but they've proven a willingness to be flexible there.  But if this is about legacy, which my gut tells me it is, then the UFC would give him the chance to avenge any (or all) of his final three Strikeforce losses, which are the biggest blemish on his record."

He has just taken too many beatings lately (overeem, stipe, hunt). I still have no faith in rothwell, respect for his recent run though, and Mir is well still Mir lol.   Don't get me wrong I definitely don't think fedor could beat any top 5 guys, well maybe arlovski, but with the right match-ups the UFC could market him into a title fight to get some ppv buys."
ufc,3dsaw9,OptimusPitts,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:48:47 2015 UTC,"Not to derail this thread, but I totally agree about Nelson tailing off of late. But I think a big part of that is that he isn't a big fighter, he's a fat fighter, and that doesn't a heavyweight contender make. Historically, he's mentioned several times that he's considered making the cut to LHW. Now that Jones is (temporarily?) out of the picture, and the field is wide open, now is probably as good a time as any."

ufc,3dlvv9,AveUnit02,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:25:42 2015 UTC,"rofl he needs to beat both to be taken serious? so i guess that makes 99% of that division clowns then, because Aldo has whipped his ass with everyone there. No one is saying he is a fighting god, but he definitely is a strong fighter.  He didnt shake when taken down by a great wrestler and it took him 50 seconds to finish the fight after they stood up from a position where Mcgregor was taking most of the damage.  Anyone not giving props to McGregor at this point is just delusional. Even if he loses to Aldo im sure it'll be a great fight. That doesnt take away from what he has done so far"

ufc,3dlvv9,GeauxTiger,16,Fri Jul 17 10:56:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think it matters if you've been involved in MMA your whole life, if you refuse to acknowledge that McGregor is at very least there or there abouts as the best fighter in the division, you're either not paying attention or are allowing your stubbornness and/or dislike cloud your judgement.  I mean, McGregor is on a 14 fight winning streak with 13 finishes. Only one man has made it past the second round with him, and that was in a fight where McGregor tore a ligament in his knee and fought the rest of the fight on the ground (winning by decision 3 rounds to zero - and almost got a submission finish against #5 ranked fighter Max Holloway).  Watch Conor fight again and notice how no one can live with his striking. People are saying Mendes was dominating the fight - that's wishful thinking. Not only had McGregor landed more than 3 times the amount of strikes Mendes had mid way through the second round whilst on his back - Denis Siver landed more shots on McGregor in a shorter fight than Mendes did - and McGregor most certainly was not dominated in that fight.  As much as people play down McGregors skills, they play up to Aldos as a complete opposite example. Watch how McGregor controls the octagon. If you stop moving for a second (i.e. ""standing straight in front of him"") you take multiple kicks to the body and head as well as his insanely accurate striking. Watch any / all of his fights. Also watch how every single finish in the UFC has been almost identical - he controls the space, has his opponents pinned against the cage, cuts off any escape, and when he gets you where he wants you, that left hook comes in and everybody breaks. Brimage, Brandao, Porier, Siver and now Mendes ... watch each KO, they are all almost identical, he cuts them off, lands combos and none of them can take those hits and crumble into a ball.  Aldo has NEVER shown that finishing power. But he gets talked up for his leg kicks - look at Mendes - which troubled him more, the few dozen body kicks of McGregor or the half dozen leg kicks of Aldo? If you are an immobile, slow fighter, Aldo looks amazing with those leg kicks. If you are a range fighter who cuts angels, forget about it.  Look at his use of range, if you stand still, he rocks you with punches, if you're moving, he uses his kicks to push you back against the cage and cut off an escape, but he uses long, long sweeping shots from range to both pin you back and finish you. He has the longest range in the division, but the way he leaps / leans in to strike, you can add another 10 inches to that range from where he starts the shot to where it lands.   Lunging in with power punch that ends the fight Long sweeping kicks   So many people were frothing at the mouth to see Mendes destroy Conor - some even think he was destroying Conor, but watch it again, very few of those elbows landed clean, one massive hook landed, at no point was Conor rocked. Watch the first round in particular again, Mendes knees almost went 3 times, once from a head punch and twice from body kicks. Coach Kavanagh said he knew it was over after round 1, and watching it again, it was pretty clear Mendes was done.  Despite being on the ground by McGregor, that stand up fighting was a master class. No body in the division can live with Conor on the feet. Including Aldo.  People said ""clueless McGregor fans"" when I said multiple times that McGregor would finish Mendes in the second round multiple times - and Aldo would not make it past the 3rd round with McGregor. Call it bullshit, but after the fight, don't backtrack by calling the fight a fix. If you don't realise what McGregor is by now, you'll have a shitty time hoping he loses all these big fights, because Aldos time is over and McGregor is going to wipe the floor in this division, mark my words."
ufc,3dlvv9,Riderslider27,4,Fri Jul 17 11:53:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed! Hardcore MMA fan here. Been a fan since 97' and haven't missed a UFC event since UFC 32. I'm probably the most judgmental and critical MMA fan anyone will ever meet but I was on the Connor hype train as soon as he KO'd Marcus Brimmage.  The thing that really disappoints me is in my opinion if you're a true UFC fan then you should  be rooting for Connor even if you hate him just forget about 145lb division and let him have it. The UFC NEEDS!!! Conor. They have lost GSP, Anderson Silva, Jon Jones etc. They have no charismatic huge superstar. No offense to Weidman or Aldo or any of the champs but besides Rousey no one else can be the face of the company for too long or the company will tank. They need a Connor for their own benefit. He brings in new fans and ones who have stopped watching. UFC 189 alone had so many new fans watching it was ridiculous. So maybe the UFC is kind of favoring him a bit but for those very reasons. They need the new Chuck Liddel. Do I think Conor is sub par though and not deserving of where he is? Not one bit. He's 100% legit"
ufc,3dlvv9,GeauxTiger,-5,Fri Jul 17 13:32:42 2015 UTC,if you refuse to acknowledge that McGregor is at very least there or there abouts as the best fighter in the division   no one is saying anything close to that. you just wrote some thousand word essay to argue with a strawman

Wish all fans were like me, and cared about these fighters because of their talent..   Saddens me that a guy like aldo doesn't draw, and a guy like conor has to go WWE on the fans so he can make money...   It was clear to me after the fight the pressure was too much, Conor seemed  too tired, and imo if he had to do less media he'd be even better for the fight"
ufc,3dlvv9,kinethix,2,Fri Jul 17 13:34:06 2015 UTC,"hate to admit it, but he won plain and simple. i hate to admit it because i always want to see the underdog win. i dont follow these guys closely...i just root for the underdog in any event :)  edit: and i remember those punishing leg kicks. i havent seen other videos mention it, but they were brutal and chad knew it. everyone was able to see how he didn't like them"
ufc,3dlvv9,bhob86,2,Fri Jul 17 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"After his fight with Siver, a friend of mine asked for my opinion (we're both betting man) on the Aldo-McGregor fight. Without hesitation, I told him Aldo would win that fight. My reason is that I would like to see McGregor match up first with either Mendes or Edgar to see how he goes with top level wrestlers and strikers.  The fight w/ Mendes happened but it still left some questions. Mendes had a short training camp, gassed early in the fight and worsened by McGregor’s strikes. McGregor also had a short amount of time to prepare for a wrestler/striker. But still… I would have loved a preplanned McGregor fight with Mendes or Edgar.  But, what I’ve recognized is that, stylistically, Connor’s fight with Aldo is a good matchup for him. Connor’s standup skill is legit very good, his fight with Brimage, Holloway and Mendes is a good example of that. Dude stays composed trading punches. I’ve seen very little of what Aldo is doing to prepare for this fight except for this and his training w/ Bilharinho. When the fight happens, this time around, I’ll exempt myself."

ufc,3dlvv9,your_fathers_beard,0,Fri Jul 17 16:23:20 2015 UTC,"I like the guy but there will be an asterisk in this fight simply because Mendes didn't truly have a full camp.  The fight was stopped too soon, watch Brock vs. Carwin to understand why.  But in this case Mendes was gassed, but he wasn't out he was turtling which with only a few seconds left is all he could do."

ufc,3dlvv9,GeauxTiger,-5,Fri Jul 17 23:48:07 2015 UTC,This is ridiculous. Of course he said he was fully prepared and the short camp didn't affect him. That doesn't mean it's true.

That doesn't mean it's true.   conor was here in town for 9 weeks, going to the gym to train every night around 8 because that's what time the fight would be. things like that are the difference between a full camp and a short camp"
ufc,3dlvv9,GeauxTiger,2,Fri Jul 17 11:42:22 2015 UTC,"A lot of people don't seem to understand that 12-6 elbow strikes are only illegal if they're coming straight down.   It's a stupid rule to begin with, but that's how it is."

ufc,3dhkbo,kremlin_,3,Thu Jul 16 09:30:01 2015 UTC,"Changing levels is when you get lower and strike. So if two fighters are exchanging blows one crouches down 6 inches and lands a stiff jab to the opponents body, he/she successfully changed levels. GSP is someone who could change levels very swiftly. It's basically crouching down and catching your opponent off guard."
ufc,3dhkbo,scs0496,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:39:36 2015 UTC,Ah I see.
ufc,3dhkbo,jaretok,2,Thu Jul 16 11:06:31 2015 UTC,"Used for take downs as well. When people do single, and double leg take downs, they change levels to do so."
ufc,3dhkbo,HeIsMyPossum,2,Thu Jul 16 17:54:02 2015 UTC,"Former wrestler here.  ""Changing levels"" is really really common terminology when dealing with takedowns. It has other meanings (I think) with boxing terms, but I can only accurately speak about the wrestling variation.  When you go for a shot in wrestling, you can't just dive in moving downward and forward. Your momentum is really bad and you'll get snapped down in the wrestling ring really easy. If you add the other person sprawling on top of you, you're going to end up face down on the mat just from the redirection of force.  When you go for a shot, first you ""change level"", basically you break all the way down into a crouch. As you go through the shot, you take your lead leg, step forward a bit, roll forward to your knee and slide your back leg around and come up. Here is a great example. This keeps your back straight, your hips underneath of you, and most of your energy going forward at a lower level, but not downward. If they sprawl, you have your hips underneath of you so you can support it and still move forward. In wrestling, you basically never want to be on your knees if you can help it, because you can't drive any power from there. So notice that in the shot you want to pop up to your feet to keep driving the shot through.  If you really watch the .gif above, watch how low he gets, but his upper body is still never over extended. He gets completely below the hands of the other guy. Again, watch the right leg step, roll to the knee, and the back leg sweep around and pop up.  Now as a disclaimer, it doesn't always work this way in MMA/UFC. Obviously in wrestling you don't have to worry about the guy purposefully kneeing you in the face. But the same basic concepts apply. You won't have a successful shot if you don't change levels to a degree and keep your body underneath you.  Hope that helps!"

ufc,3diipu,XVOS,5,Thu Jul 16 15:30:11 2015 UTC,"I'm curious. Did you have these concerns as a boxing fan?  Obviously, we don't know the long term effects yet, but as a whole I think MMA is much safer than boxing. Think of it this way, if a boxer is knocked down he has until the count of ten to get his shit together.  Could you imagine those rules in MMA? It would be absolutely brutal. As far as early/late stoppages, some refs are obviously better than others, but it's easy to forget that they are humans and do make mistakes.  It's a hard job and when someone fucks up there is a huge outcry.  I would say the refs do a pretty good job about 90% of the time. (Especially the last year.)"
ufc,3diipu,Dick_shoes,5,Thu Jul 16 15:43:35 2015 UTC,"I've heard MMA is safer as well.  While many people believe the thinner padding on the fists makes MMA more ""hardcore"" than boxing, I've also heard that extra padding allows boxers to punch harder without fear of breaking the bones in their hands, which means more rocking of the brain in boxing."
ufc,3diipu,madog20x,0,Thu Jul 16 16:44:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly boxing stoppages are as a whole much quicker (at least in terms of the situation I'm discussing). If a boxer is taking punishment and not defending himself or throwing the fight is almost always stopped within ten seconds. In terms of structural stuff like how knockdowns are handled, I don't know really that's kind of how the sport works. I'm not sure how you would do the wrestling and BJJ portions of MMA like boxing. As for concerns about stoppages, I absolutely have them as a boxing fan, and the like much of the boxing community I criticize referees on both ends (early and late) frequently. I guess I am talking about something different which is in an admittedly different sport in the situations I'm describing I see stoppages in the UFC happening much later if at all when people are just getting thrashed on the ground and it worries me. Maybe I don't get it, and somehow those elbows to the temple aren't doing the damage it looks like they are to me, but I can't remember the last boxing fight where I've seen someone take the punishment Thompson took last night in such a short period.  The other stuff, boxing is worse than UFC for the other kind of ring death where someone takes a massive amount of punishment over the course of a long fight. No UFC fighter eats 350 punches in an evening because the UFC isn't structured like that (12 round championship fights are 10 minutes longer and boxers punch to the head more). Honestly, both sports are horrifying injurious to those involved and the worst injuries will be 20 years after folks retire. Unfortunately, this type of thing (repeated concussions) is structural to both sports and can't be helped. The issue of rapid trauma over a short period putting people into comas though can be prevented (or at least severely lessened) with quicker stoppages and that is something boxing has finally (mostly) figured out after a series of preventable tragedies.   I guess I just hope the UFC doesn't have to go through a similar process to learn this lesson."
ufc,3diipu,Sinky13,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:39:09 2015 UTC,I'm not going to dignify this. Fucking half wit.
ufc,3diipu,PreSchoolGGW,2,Thu Jul 16 23:31:05 2015 UTC,"I think the most dangerous thing the UFC is facing right now is the banning of IVs for rehydrating post weigh-in. Those, combined with trauma to the head, are the real fucking danger.  I agree with you, but I feel that the stoppages are mostly good. Also, it comes down to fighters knowing what they're getting into, and doing it willingly, mixed with viewers not wanting to see early stoppages.  Dana White and Zuffa, Inc. are going to give the people what they want, not what is most safe."
ufc,3diipu,TylertheDouche,2,Thu Jul 16 15:52:52 2015 UTC,"For one, a 12 round boxing match is much longer than a 5 round UFC fight. This allows for more punches and damage to be dealt out  Boxers are allowed to be knocked down, regain some consciousness, and then fight again, often getting knocked down again; this does not happen in the UFC.  Boxing gloves cause more head trauma compared to UFC gloves.   Boxing has its bad stoppages. UFC has its bad stoppages. Both are caused by human error which will never be truly fixed. However,  I do agree with you. Refs are there to save fighters lives and I DEFINITELY do not ever like to watch a fighter get beat past his breaking point"
ufc,3diipu,theidler666,3,Thu Jul 16 18:07:56 2015 UTC,"i think you have made some great points here. just to add to what you have said - the vast majority of the time, boxers are aiming for the head and over a longer fight that takes its toll. there is no respite when the fight goes to the ground like in UFC when there is wrestling going on.  add to that the fact that entire parts of an MMA fighters training camp is based on ground work both takedown and takedown defence and guard/mount work whilst on the ground. all the while the boxer is being punched in the head when he is training (i realise there are other elements of training for boxers and MMA guys but I hope you get what i am saying)."
ufc,3diipu,TylertheDouche,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:25:37 2015 UTC,Yes. Good point. I agree.
ufc,3diipu,americandream1159,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:40:40 2015 UTC,"Boxers have weighted gloves, which add a little more power and recklessness to shots. MMA fighters have ounce and a half gloves that are essentially to prevent breaking your hand. When boxers get knocked out, they have ten seconds to collect themselves. Not so in MMA. Refs in boxing have gotten better recently, but for the most part MMA learned from boxing's mistakes. Unless you're Kim Winslow or affiliated with Bellator."
ufc,3diipu,Rezenik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:09:54 2015 UTC,"Do you really think a weighted glove does more damage than an elbow though? I'm not really comparing the two, more asking for expertise on MMA that I don't possess to see if I'm not getting something. Also the ten seconds to collect yourself thing is slightly misleading the way you are putting it. Most times a boxer is out cold, the fight gets waved off entirely with no count. In high level fights it is pretty rare that someone gets KTFO like that. Most knockdowns aren't knockouts at all, and instead a fighter gets hit by a punch that either disorients him (temple shot) or hurts him bad enough that he falls (or literally knocks him over). Though I'm not arguing that boxing isn't an awful sport for health (it is, so is MMA) and that being repeatedly knocked down or concussed isn't awful (it is, obviously).   What I am wondering is if I'm missing something in terms of why situations like the second round of the Thompson vs. Ferguson fight are allowed to continue when it seems obvious (to me) that one fighter's health and possibly his life, are in jeopardy from the repeated hard shots to the head he is taking."
ufc,3diipu,americandream1159,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:21:52 2015 UTC,"A bare handed punch has more force than an elbow, the elbow just has more PSI. With a weighted glove you're able to throw a ridiculous amount of force, especially at higher weight classes, that overshadows an elbow. Elbows have a main appeal of being fast, being able to be thrown at very close ranges, and having the ability to cut.  EDIT: Also, in the future you should consider posting to r/mma. They have over 20x the amount of online users that r/UFC has most of the time."
ufc,3diipu,americandream1159,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:09:14 2015 UTC,"Do you really think a weighted glove does more damage than an elbow though?   Short term yes, bcuz the elbow acts as a blade. A fist is more of a club. If you take a baseball bat to the head, you'll feel it differently than a cut. Don't get me wrong, it's both dangerous. Jus most ppl will blow off a cut, mos ppl won't blow off a concussion.   Also the ten seconds to collect yourself thing is slightly misleading the way you are putting it. Most times a boxer is out cold, the fight gets waved off entirely with no count. In high level fights it is pretty rare that someone gets KTFO like that. Most knockdowns aren't knockouts at all, and instead a fighter gets hit by a punch that either disorients him (temple shot) or hurts him bad enough that he falls (or literally knocks him over).   This is true. Some knockdowns are jus that: knockdowns. You take a big shot in any sport and you're likely to go dwn. As for the temple shots, I've had three(!) concussions and one of them may or may not have been a temple shot. I lost memory of it. The disorientation is a slight concussion, and putting a guy back out there after ten seconds is reckless at best.   I'm not really comparing the two, more asking for expertise on MMA that I don't possess to see if I'm not getting something...[t]hough I'm not arguing that boxing isn't an awful sport for health (it is, so is MMA) and that being repeatedly knocked down or concussed isn't awful (it is, obviously).   I understand. You're new to the sport. And since you were a boxing fan first, which has the (well-deserved) legacy of being the ""Sweet Science"" compared to MMA's stigma of ""cagefighting"", you got questions. I'm happy to answer them. Thank you for having an open mind.   What I am wondering is if I'm missing something in terms of why situations like the second round of the Thompson vs. Ferguson fight are allowed to continue when it seems obvious (to me) that one fighter's health and possibly his life, are in jeopardy from the repeated hard shots to the head he is taking.   OK, here's the complicated part of MMA. Boxing, you are strictly punching. MMA involves standing, transition, and ground. You're right, Thomson took a ton of punches. But he also was advancing position fairly intelligently. That's important. You could argue that Thomson was finished bcuz like we agree, he took a LOT of punches. But he still was (barely) intelligent enough to continue. Another difference is the refereeing. The UFC uses a small number of referees, especially when they fight in America. Herb Dean and Big John McCarthy are the best and have been for a while. Then Mazzagatti, Lavigne and Yamasaki. Can you even name a boxing ref? There are so many out there that each one is either really good or really bad or kinda average or goodish sometimes. But with such a tight rotation of guys, they develop a sense of familiarity and rapport with fighters. Dean was a former fighter himself and McCarthy has been reffing events since UFC 2. This is why it seems fights go longer and are more brutal. Any other questions, let me know. I've been following MMA since 2007 and my youngest brother is at The MMA Lab doing jiu-jitsu, so even tho I'm not the most knowledgeable on /r/MMA, I definitely know enough to explain.  NOTE: The second link is from UFC 3, but it's all I could find in good quality. Plus it has Royce Gracie's last fight, and he might as well be required viewing for MMA fans."
ufc,3diipu,americandream1159,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:02:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the nuanced response, it is certainly informative and mainly I came here for information. As for boxing refs I certainly agree that there are too many and a lot of terrible ones (pretty much all the texas refs suck, though the rotation for huge PPV fights tend to be really good).  I guess what I'm trying to get a feel for is in the UFC what does being in a defenseless position look like and where is the line. Why did the main event fight get stopped so quickly compared to the Thompson fight. I understand that Mir seriously caught him and everything else was just extra damage but I don't necessarily understand why what happened to Thompson after he fell due to an elbow to the temple is different and where is the line. To me if I was refereeing in both cases I would have pulled the plug when the guy just dropped after taking a huge punch and then his opponent followed up. If not then the real warning flag which made me nauseous was when Thompson curled into a fetal position and covered his head while Ferguson rained blows on him for a solid 15 second period. From my experience in a different sport that is basically a fighter not defending himself actively and thus basically a forfeit (analogous to when a boxer turtles on the ropes with a high guard and stops throwing while his opponent rains hay-makers on him, a situation that will always cause a rapid stoppage).  By the way, thanks for addressing my points seriously, I understand that I'm coming from a outside position (though I've probably watched 40-50 UFC bouts I am by no means an expert and I don't have the advantage of having fought like with boxing), but I by no means meant to make a boxing>UFC argument that some people seem to take this as (frankly to me it is more of a what do you like more apples or oranges situation where you are comparing fundamentally different things) or calling me a 'fucking halfwit'."
ufc,3diipu,BigMike8,2,Thu Jul 16 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not, the fetal position is the beginning of a jiu-jitsu technique called ""shrimping out"". Usually guys get stopped there, tho. That's the difference hahaha. You try to shrimp out then you take a punch to the forehead. I'm a fight fan. I watch kickboxing (Glory), boxing, BJJ (Metamoris), hell even WWE. They're all similar, but not quite the same. For example, the Mayweather-Pacquaio fight. Under MMA rules, Pacquaio shows aggression and octagon control for a lot of the fight. But boxing says he missed punches. It's different. Boxing is a part of MMA the same way that baseball is part of football; you punch in boxing and MMA and you throw in football and baseball. But other than that, they're different worlds. This is a defenseless position. But this is the reason you see guys follow up. The fight isn't over until the ref stops it. You're exactly right. Apples to oranges."
ufc,3diipu,canadianRSK,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:57:51 2015 UTC,"First of all, OWW on the hendo punch. Second, I understand the on your back defending with legs (which they use almost like fencing foils to parry blows) thing and am familiar with it (though I didn't know the name shrimp) when I get home I'll post a picture from my DVR of the portion I was discussing which looked different to me, with Thompson covering his head head and legs pulled inwards (something like this image I found on google http://www.newsrealblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/fetal-position.jpg) was what freaked me out most. As for the fight not being over until the ref stops it, that's true in every fight sport and is the brilliance.   Here's a great boxing finish that also demonstrates how fights aren't over until the bell or ref stoppage. Love this JCC performance. Saw it live. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgenYK7VaxY"

ufc,3d9m08,Srirachachacha,2,Tue Jul 14 21:32:32 2015 UTC,Mendes was amazing. He deserves all the credit.  However...from UFC's perspective - they need Conor to win.  He's their golden boy.  Their first fighter in a long time that can be the face of the company.  I'm surprised they gave Mendes the fight actually - he was the worst case scenario replacement in my book.  Why would it be bad if Mendes won from a business standpoint?  They've seen that fight with Aldo - twice.  They also invested way too much into Conor's promotion.

Then they stand up and he knocks him out with a left?  At 144?  Conor looked weak at the weigh in...I didn't think he'd have a ton of knock out power for that fight.

ufc,3d9m08,Dr_Brian_Pepper,2,Wed Jul 15 08:09:02 2015 UTC,"It's a pretty popular opinion that it was 2-0 Mendes if they made it out of the 2nd. So considering Connor turned the fight around and won when he was only a few seconds away from being down 2-0, I don't think it's ridiculous to say he lost the first 9:45."
ufc,3d9m08,asheepysheep,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:07:42 2015 UTC,"No, it is ridiculous. Regardless of what you think, stating he only won 12 seconds of the fight makes you look ignorant, anyone with any knowledge in this sport knows that. McGregor started the fight pushing the pace and won the entire standup exchange, which guess what? It was more than 12 seconds...."

It doesn't make me ignorant that you don't understand the difference between being ahead after the first 9:45 and winning each of the the first 585 seconds split into tiny little, individual, 1 second long competitions."
ufc,3d9m08,asheepysheep,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:08:24 2015 UTC,"No it does, because perpetuating things like that will only lead for people to believe you. You are misinformed on how to judge a fight. Stating that your claim means something else that it isn't is just grasping."

ufc,3d9m08,NJ_state_of_mind,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:04:46 2015 UTC,He most definitely will not. That depends on the fight and immediate rematches are rare.   Dana is still pissed with him for pulling out of 5 ufc title fights. That's why he put up the interim belt.
ufc,3d9m08,Try__Again__Please,8,Tue Jul 14 20:28:54 2015 UTC,"Any dominant champion usually gets an immediate rematch. Aldo hasn't lost in what, 7+ years? Trust me, he will get one if he loses. Just like Anderson Silva. Just like GSP. Just like BJ Penn.  And if there is an opportunity to have another huge PPV with added drama between McGregor and Aldo, do you think the UFC will pass up on that?"
ufc,3d9m08,NJ_state_of_mind,5,Tue Jul 14 20:49:39 2015 UTC,"I thought Barao did get a rematch but passed out cutting weight, thus not being able to fight."
ufc,3d9m08,Michael174,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:08:41 2015 UTC,"Sort of depends really.   If it's close, then he'll definitely get a immediate rematch. If it's a pure pounding, or 1st round knock out,  I can't see a rematch happening straight away.   The Division is too stacked. The UFC for once has the opportunity to have 3 or 4 mega fights with out any immediate rematchs"
ufc,3d9m08,Doboworth,0,Tue Jul 14 21:29:34 2015 UTC,GSP didn't get an immediate rematch though.  He lost to Serra then had to beat Koscheck to get another title shot.
ufc,3d9m08,ProductionDude17,2,Tue Jul 14 21:39:39 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Serra was hurt in between their matches. Serra didn't fight anyone else.

ufc,3d9m08,bro-ster,3,Tue Jul 14 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"Do I think that the only featherweight champion that the UFC has ever had has a chance? The man who hasn't lost in 10 years and has beat the very best the division has to offer? Yeah, and it's ignorant to think he doesn't have a chance. All of these new MMA fans probably have never seen Jose fight and only watch Conor because he's got a buzz going. He is a great fighter don't get me wrong but anybody who discredits Jose and think Conor walks through him is blinded by their own bias."
ufc,3d9m08,IRA_INK,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:49:04 2015 UTC,I agree Aldo is a beast in the ring but that will generally only last so long people like Marciano and Mayweather aside. Who knows if Mcgreggor will be the one to beat him but I really hope he does. I'd like a new champ and even if it's annoying new fans are a great thing for the sport.
ufc,3d9m08,munesiriou,7,Wed Jul 15 08:06:28 2015 UTC,"Love McGregor, but so much of him and who he interacts with feels like manufactured drama. Just keep whopping ass Conor, and I'll keep watching. I don't need the WWE drama package"
ufc,3d9m08,carl7967,2,Wed Jul 15 08:49:30 2015 UTC,It's a business and a living for these guys. They do what they must to sell tickets. This is how nearly all sports work.

ufc,3d9m08,mistere676,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:28:26 2015 UTC,It feels really staged. Like the Mendes and McGregor confrontation at the weigh in was straight WWE drama
ufc,3d9m08,YesMcGee,-5,Wed Jul 15 00:27:48 2015 UTC,Be a great fight.  I think Edgar would give Conor more of a fight than Aldo.
ufc,3d9m08,FionnMcKewl,-2,Tue Jul 14 20:15:49 2015 UTC,"As in, Aldo would clearly lose to Connor?"
ufc,3d9m08,uber-joey,-4,Wed Jul 15 05:41:23 2015 UTC,"Ye. I think Conor will beat Aldo.   Conor's weakness is the ground, he has shocking ground game which we all saw in the Mendes fight. Edgar's good all-round, he's got great takedown ability & he's a lot better striking than Chad. For me Conor vs Edgar is the Croke Park fight."

ufc,3d9m08,Sinky13,8,Tue Jul 14 21:43:40 2015 UTC,"You're fucking out of your simple mind. Edgar went to the cage to congratulate Conor and show him respect. Conor shook his hand and smiled at him (which is when I'm sure Edgar mentioned fighting).   Edgar is the classiest guy in the sport and a sure fire HOFer. He knows how to handles himself and I don't think anybody, Conor especially, had an issue with him creeping on the mat. He didn't come into the cage and show disrespect."

ufc,3davmc,Subver5ion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:40:57 2015 UTC,"That's a possibility.   Fedor's speed has deterred due to age and lack of motivation to maintain or improve. He quite frankly after his dad died and got rich stopped giving it his 100% in MMA. Shame because to this day he is the clear cut fighting GOAT.  Fedor will never be the skillful Fedor we've seen from 2003 - 2008. Dat Prime form is gone.  That's why it sucks he is returning.  But if he returns, regardless of the skill level he comes in at, I want him to fight Werdum. If there's anyone who deserve to get the torch passes to, it's fookin Werdum man.   That motherfucker has EEEEEEEASY wins over Cain, Big Nog AND Fedor. I think he beat PED Reem in Strikeforce too (still has a win over Reem though, as well as Big Foot Silva and Gonzaga...). That is unheard of.   Win-win in the that Werdum fight.   If he lost, it's to top tier Werdum. No shame, no tarnish. He passes the torch FOR REAL this time.  If he wins, he gets that UFC HW title from probably the most legit HW the world's ever seen.  Any other fight I'm betting $$$$ against Fedor. And that would be heartbreaking!"
ufc,3davmc,Subver5ion,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:26:15 2015 UTC,"I can see your logic and I also agree about Werdum, the guy is as legit as they come!  However I just cant see the UFC signing him, they tried for so many years and failed. Fedor openly hates Dana.... If they make it work i'll be amazed and super excited! But there's no way his come back fight would be for the title. IF he came to the UFC, I think they would test the water against an older opponant. Maybe an Arlovski rematch?"
ufc,3davmc,TylertheDouche,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:00:22 2015 UTC,"They were about to SEAL the deal, for Brock vs. Fedor in the Cowboy Stadium, when Fedor's dad died and negotiations fell through. I think the UFC doesn't care about the co-promotion anymore. I think their beef was that they wanted Fedor to be allowed to compete in Sambo competitions.  If you think about it, the M-1 Global on the mat as well as on his gloves weren't too big a deal in StrikeForce. UFC saw tooooo much money to be made from Fedor to throw it all away for that.  I think Dana White and Fedor's team are on decent terms nowadays."
ufc,3davmc,TylertheDouche,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:50:49 2015 UTC,You have so far predicted one fighter to beat another fighter and linked me to a forum of speculation.
ufc,3davmc,yoyoitsme,-3,Tue Jul 14 22:06:19 2015 UTC,"Wrong.  I first linked you to where I said Fabricio Werdum would beat Cain, and then I predicted Fedor would come out of retirement and face Werdum for the UFC title.  I was the only one who had this brilliant thought.  And it's not speculation, Fedor is back, check his official Facebook, and those threads with his translated interview announcing his return to MMA.   This is going to happen by early 2016, save this post."

ufc,3d6wsu,mikeyjk,7,Tue Jul 14 05:22:56 2015 UTC,That's great I always been looking for analysis like this of fights by actually fighters. Any time I look on YouTube I get met with loads of horrible fan made ones that are so bias.
ufc,3d6wsu,Kirix_,5,Tue Jul 14 09:45:01 2015 UTC,"I was surprised by this breakdown to be honest. It was my ignorant opinion that that pivotal guillotine was actually pretty good, Chad Mendes had a really good position, and Conor just sorta panicked and got lucky flailing about to get out of it.  I didn't realize that aspect of him flipping out of it and protecting himself from the grip of the legs, and I'm more appreciative of Conor's game now that I know there was method to his madness and he didn't just get out of it with a lucky flail.  Still, guy clearly needs a lot of work on his ground game before the Title Unification fight."
ufc,3d6wsu,kremlin_,0,Tue Jul 14 13:20:49 2015 UTC,His ground game was shockingly bad.  That should be his focus for the next few months.

ufc,3d6wsu,Tullamore_Who,0,Tue Jul 14 20:42:32 2015 UTC,"That explains a lot.  Not sure why Conor fans are offended by critique of his ground game.  It was very, very bad.    This helps explain it.  Cheers."
ufc,3d6wsu,grig109,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:47:03 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think it was that bad.  He was able to sprawl several times, and avoid takedowns.  I think once in the first round he was able to get back to his feet after he was taken down, and he certainly capitalized on the Mendes error in the second round to end the fight.  It's obviously not his strength, but considering he was facing the best wrestler in the division, and apparently he had a knee injury I think he did reasonably well."

ufc,3d92y7,FighterWireDotCom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:51:04 2015 UTC,"Im actually pretty excited for Dillashaw/Barao. I think Barao is going to be coming in with something to prove and Dillishaw is a strong champ (trains year round, constantly working to improve, and self aware of ability and room for growth).  I think chances are good that we may even see a more exciting fight than the first (in which Barao got schooled with good technique and footwork from Dillashaw).  Both guys will be slinging some leather.  I'm stoked."
ufc,3d92y7,kremlin_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:18:42 2015 UTC,"Oddly, the thing I'm most excited to see isn't the fights at all, it's that slick new UI (can you call it a UI?) and graphics and all that. The stuff they introduced in 189.   Having attractive modern graphics honestly improves the experience for me probably more than it should. I wish I could personally thank the team that designed it. Seriously."
ufc,3d92y7,Spax_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:55:29 2015 UTC,Isn't taste strange? I think the new look is really cheap and a bit cartoonish.
ufc,3d92y7,chromeshelter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:01:11 2015 UTC,"It actually really follows the current design trends in several ways. I think most of the ppl who don't like it will get easily used to it in the long run as it is really easy on the eyes and they made the design really unified / standardized so we will see the same type of elements on all materials connected to UFC. They didn't really have a design toolkit before this, just remember the event posters 1-1,5 years ago. They were really low end compared to the current stuff."
ufc,3d92y7,Spax_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:24:54 2015 UTC,I know they've struggled with their brand and look a lot over the years and in the five years I've been a fan there have been many different faces. I hope that what they do works for them but I miss the CGI warrior intro and I don't like the uniforms because there's no flair to any of them. What about Phil Davis? Will he still have his pink shorts? These are important considerations.
ufc,3d92y7,chromeshelter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:36:08 2015 UTC,I think Phil Davis Woll still wear the pink ones...  but he's with Bellator now :(
ufc,3d92y7,Spax_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"My point is, they lack personality. I doubt we'll ever see a fighter walk to the ring wearing their Gi again and I for one will miss seeing sea bass fishing adverts scrawled across Hendricks' ass whilst he's body slamming someone to the ground.
