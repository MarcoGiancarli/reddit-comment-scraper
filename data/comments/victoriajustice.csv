victoriajustice,39hzea,PaisanTed,2,Thu Jun 11 21:55:33 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that its for a role... I know its a vain hope but I still hope lol. https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t50.2886-16/11424039_1094686093879435_380647272_n.mp4 for a non instagram version too
victoriajustice,39hzea,Jorfent706,4,Sat Jun 13 10:06:36 2015 UTC,Yeah. At least she hasn't gotten a bunch of stupid tattoos.
victoriajustice,39hzea,JPLnavy,6,Thu Jun 11 22:25:33 2015 UTC,"Love her to death and all but god no, please no."
victoriajustice,39hzea,comethrowitaway,-3,Thu Jun 11 23:01:57 2015 UTC,Septum rings are fantastic and she looks great with it
victoriajustice,398rog,Dedbent,5,Wed Jun 10 02:00:24 2015 UTC,Whoever planned that advertisement across her chest should be shot immediately.

victoriajustice,38dw20,evengraves,6,Wed Jun 3 21:18:22 2015 UTC,Slightly bigger.
victoriajustice,38dw20,Joker961,3,Thu Jun 4 10:43:31 2015 UTC,anyone have this in better quality?
victoriajustice,38dw20,ILIKEPIE4715,2,Thu Jun 4 00:42:01 2015 UTC,She is reeeeeeaaaallly cute in this pic
victoriajustice,38dw20,hoser89,2,Thu Jun 4 00:12:16 2015 UTC,That face is really turning me on.

victoriajustice,38a5gh,skiier23,3,Wed Jun 3 05:46:08 2015 UTC,"Is this an ad for alba? All I see are alba products and the ""alba botanica"" at the top looks like it was Photoshopped in because it's supposed to be angled towards her, but it looks like it's facing us."
victoriajustice,38a5gh,MisterJimJim,2,Wed Jun 3 09:55:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I'm almost entirely sure that's photoshopped. If this ends up on celebrity websites as ""caught by paparazzi"" it'll only fuel my already building trust issues for the media."
victoriajustice,38a5gh,JPLnavy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:27:39 2015 UTC,Also no drug store is going to let a paparazzo snap photos like that.
victoriajustice,38a5gh,flamingmenudo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:03:16 2015 UTC,"Apparently these were taken at Whole Foods (according to other places ive seen them posted). Ive seen sets come from there that were taken inside the store, but these do look different than most of those sets."
victoriajustice,38a5gh,-OP_pls-,3,Wed Jun 3 19:10:49 2015 UTC,"seriously? she's just picking up some sunscreen and she looks that good? god i'm glad i'm not a chick, cause if i was i'd probably kill myself from jealousy. jeez."

victoriajustice,37tkqg,rondellr09,17,Sat May 30 07:31:55 2015 UTC,This is from her Kode Magazine shoot - more here  https://imgur.com/a/Mowew
victoriajustice,37tkqg,duhbicboii,12,Sat May 30 16:16:09 2015 UTC,Is there really no picture of her in this outfit from the rear side? :(
victoriajustice,37tkqg,xinnabtw,7,Sat May 30 16:28:37 2015 UTC,Hopefully this kind of shoot wasn't a one off thing for her
victoriajustice,37tkqg,BraverDanger,2,Sat May 30 10:07:19 2015 UTC,"She is so beautiful,  wish she would start appearing in movies."
victoriajustice,37tkqg,tonman101,3,Sat May 30 13:26:36 2015 UTC,"She has been in movies, but they rarely if ever do well. Her last show just got canceled, but imo it wasn't that great. She's better suited as a model."
victoriajustice,37tkqg,I_Tread_Lightly,4,Sat May 30 15:59:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about a Nick movie or a Disney Channel movie, I'm talking about a real, big budget movie."
victoriajustice,37tkqg,tonman101,2,Sat May 30 19:42:13 2015 UTC,Holy shit
victoriajustice,37tkqg,mydadsnotaphoneduh,2,Sat May 30 14:57:31 2015 UTC,OP likes my 50/50 hm?
victoriajustice,37tkqg,skiier23,0,Sat May 30 21:43:28 2015 UTC,Is this the girl on the weeknd album cover
victoriajustice,37tkqg,poopedthebed,-7,Sat May 30 14:58:42 2015 UTC,Is she wearing a condom on her leg?
victoriajustice,37mu61,louistulley,2,Thu May 28 20:01:19 2015 UTC,INCREDIBLE  look.
victoriajustice,37h6zv,-OP_pls-,19,Wed May 27 16:39:33 2015 UTC,She is so close to flawless that it hurts.
victoriajustice,37h6zv,rhcp88,8,Wed May 27 16:42:20 2015 UTC,"Don't look at me like that, V. I'm going to melt if you look at me like that."
victoriajustice,37h6zv,coscorrodrift,3,Wed May 27 18:00:11 2015 UTC,"Unnngh...clicking through the album in succession with RES is just amazing. Even just a simple look at the camera, with a wave at the end as the cherry on top."
victoriajustice,37h6zv,TheRipePunani,4,Wed May 27 18:43:38 2015 UTC,She's not even trying and she looks so hot. Is this just some random person taking pics of her?
victoriajustice,37h6zv,CrackerJackBunny,-1,Thu May 28 01:10:24 2015 UTC,"I don't really think we can call this person ""just some random"", for these photos we own them more than that. Whom ever took these is an Ace."
victoriajustice,37h6zv,nadnerbman163,0,Thu May 28 13:43:51 2015 UTC,I love this. How many candids of celebs do you see where they are smile and waving at paparazzi? This looks more like a photoshoot than her just walking around. Did she just come back from the perfect date? Why is does she look so beautiful?
victoriajustice,37bzfz,SmoopyRocks,8,Tue May 26 14:41:22 2015 UTC,booooty!
victoriajustice,37bzfz,LeviathanDementia,4,Tue May 26 19:50:05 2015 UTC,Nice huh
victoriajustice,37bzfz,Lamachus,9,Tue May 26 19:50:47 2015 UTC,"More than nice. Her pants, her ass, her perfect tummy...  One day Vic's attractiveness is going to break the internet."
victoriajustice,37bzfz,arrayed,3,Tue May 26 21:27:09 2015 UTC,Hot Jeans!!
victoriajustice,379otr,Dedbent,1 point,Tue May 26 00:32:56 2015 UTC,I don't know why she took it down. There was some more dumb Ariana drama this morning.
victoriajustice,379otr,agkman,2,Tue May 26 00:34:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a cute pic ... don't see what issues she could have seen with it.  Usually when she removes things it's because people react negatively to something (such as that one with champagne at a photoshoot) ... because heaven forbid a 22 year old woman hold a bottle of alcohol ... or the video of her shooting a gun."
victoriajustice,379otr,Colorfag,3,Tue May 26 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"From what I read. Someone she followed on twitter changed her name to something anti-Ariana. So, all Ariana fans that love to hate on Vic showed up in the comments."
victoriajustice,379otr,serendipitybot,3,Tue May 26 02:34:59 2015 UTC,Why cant we all just get along  Also both girls are great.
victoriajustice,3770qt,aomiep,0,Mon May 25 11:57:58 2015 UTC,Wow where is this photoshoot from?
victoriajustice,3770qt,CrackerJackBunny,13,Mon May 25 17:53:36 2015 UTC,You can find more there : https://imgur.com/a/Mowew
victoriajustice,3770qt,ThiefofNobility,11,Mon May 25 18:47:06 2015 UTC,Wow. I mean she's gorgeous to begin with but this shoot makes her look like a God Damn supermodel.

victoriajustice,374son,Dedbent,2,Sun May 24 21:47:53 2015 UTC,"She's so skinny now that she's started losing her curves. Urgh, why do some girls do this!"
victoriajustice,374son,Haines11,1 point,Mon May 25 00:24:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not gonna deny, in some clothes it looks like she has no ass, but that is the fault of the clothes. She isn't too skinny and she is curvy. Just look at some more recent pics of her"
victoriajustice,374son,reecej101,0,Mon May 25 09:47:32 2015 UTC,I have and she's too skinny in them as well.
victoriajustice,374son,Haines11,1 point,Mon May 25 11:12:24 2015 UTC,"she doesnt look too skinny to me, she looks fine. she may be skinnier than you want but that doesnt mean she is too skinny. she looks lovely and still has her curves"
victoriajustice,374son,reecej101,3,Mon May 25 11:19:30 2015 UTC,I realised after I posted that I should have said that she's too skinny in my eyes as do I realise that one man's poison is another man's pleasure.  I'm just concerned is all.
victoriajustice,371b2h,Dedbent,3,Sat May 23 22:58:44 2015 UTC,"Got this from the photog's IG. Here is a link to a pic on his site. I tried to mess aroud with #s in the link to get a bigger version, but failed. Maybe someone else can succeed."
victoriajustice,371b2h,agkman,1 point,Sat May 23 23:17:36 2015 UTC,We need more outtakes from all of her shoots over the last 6 months.
victoriajustice,36pu4n,-OP_pls-,4,Thu May 21 04:03:39 2015 UTC,"It's a very glamorous and elegant way of saying ""I'm not wearing any underwear ;)"". She pulls it off great though. Simply gorgeous."
victoriajustice,36pu4n,JPLnavy,5,Thu May 21 16:47:42 2015 UTC,"Well I did some research and seems like this thing: NSFW https://imgur.com/Ggc6uaV is still called underwear. I could be wrong, but I think she could be into this stuff. Either way she's very good at messing with us. lol"
victoriajustice,36pu4n,HamLis,5,Thu May 21 20:29:14 2015 UTC,Case Closed she said herself that she was wearing underwear https://instagram.com/p/29noNEHIHP/
victoriajustice,36pu4n,DiamondRyce,1 point,Thu May 21 23:54:24 2015 UTC,"I was gonna say no way but after closer inspection I figured out how they did it, if they did it. I'll let the illusion trick me regardless."
victoriajustice,36pu4n,JPLnavy,7,Fri May 22 00:22:37 2015 UTC,"How do you sit in a dress like that?  And, uh, how do you wear underwear?  I volunteer to investigate further."
victoriajustice,36pu4n,hnf1975,-1,Thu May 21 13:33:33 2015 UTC,WHOOOOO is doing her makeup these days?! i love VJ she's my vote for the hottest girl in the world but in these pix her face is a dif color than the rest of her skin on her bod
victoriajustice,36neok,DiamondRyce,1 point,Wed May 20 17:33:36 2015 UTC,Still not sure where she is on the list since Maxim only said Taylor Swift is number one. Still a nice a picture of Vic even in Black and White.   number 8 on the slideshow of the link.   Edit: Not sure why Ari is the thumbnail of this link. Lol
victoriajustice,36neok,expletiveadded,1 point,Wed May 20 17:34:52 2015 UTC,I was confused for a second.

victoriajustice,36ev25,Dedbent,2,Mon May 18 21:04:03 2015 UTC,"So once again with Cosmo, we seemingly miss out on a great pic with that outfit at 13-14 seconds with the shear fabric.  Something similar is in the magazine with the hat, but it's certainly not the same outfit.   Too bad, hope for outtakes that will never appear."

victoriajustice,35zwav,Dedbent,3,Thu May 14 22:28:00 2015 UTC,I thought it was supposed to be out in June.
victoriajustice,35zwav,agkman,3,Thu May 14 22:28:24 2015 UTC,"It's a VJ project, why wouldn't there be issues in it just coming out normal.  Seriously, everything involving her is so ridiculous.  There's always some sort of delay or issue. I'll believe this movie is coming out when I see it with my own eyes, just like the indie film she made.   Cute poster though."
victoriajustice,35zwav,agkman,2,Thu May 14 22:33:35 2015 UTC,"BTW, the fact its May 14th and the film was supposed to come out June 26th, and no poster or trailer had come out yet should have been a clue something was up.    Even for a smaller film like this, you wouldn't put off any promotion til the last 30 days."
victoriajustice,35zwav,agkman,2,Thu May 14 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you are right. Its been so crazy busy at my job. It seems like March was last week."
victoriajustice,35zwav,hnf1975,2,Thu May 14 23:02:32 2015 UTC,Time flies  Here is the alternate poster that VJ tweeted first (with the wrong date of August 7th ... which seemingly was the first delayed date)  Outskirts Poster 2

victoriajustice,3519j7,SnobbyLion,2,Wed May 6 20:53:22 2015 UTC,I got them upped. I will say the east coast version is better. It has a nice little booty shot the west coast version doesn't have.  East Coast  West Coast
victoriajustice,3519j7,Dedbent,1 point,Thu May 7 00:10:52 2015 UTC,Yeah we got screwed over when she was singing. The camera only panned to Ed and Bridget.
victoriajustice,3519j7,reecej101,1 point,Thu May 7 00:41:06 2015 UTC,I saw the West Coast Version so this highlight I am assuming is from the East Coast version.
victoriajustice,3519j7,marthasamigo,1 point,Wed May 6 07:13:31 2015 UTC,There's different versions?? Can't they just show the same one
victoriajustice,3519j7,Dedbent,2,Wed May 6 09:06:41 2015 UTC,"It was very slightly different. The highlight I posted was a duet with those two singing some undatable song. On the west coast, we had Ed, Bridgit and Vic singing Britney Spears ""Baby One More Time"".  An apparently the in our we got Ed kissing the guy that was hitting on Victoria."
victoriajustice,3519j7,Jorfent706,1 point,Wed May 6 15:38:56 2015 UTC,Can you say what some of the differences are in the West Coast version? East coast was live. Did they have a separate live version for the West coast?
victoriajustice,3519j7,reecej101,3,Wed May 6 11:29:15 2015 UTC,I have both versions. I could upload them after work if anyone wants them.

victoriajustice,31gfp4,reecej101,0,Sat Apr 4 21:35:57 2015 UTC,why is this being downvoted so much :/ its a pic of victoria in a subreddit about her. im confused
victoriajustice,31gfp4,-OP_pls-,5,Sat Apr 4 21:33:29 2015 UTC,"I can think of a couple reasons...   Instagram link. You have to screenshot to save the pic. Most people appreciate the imgur link over the direct link to an IG account. There's also the chance she deletes it from instagram and it vanishes. Dead link is no bueno. Maybe they don't like that its taken from a distance? More Vic, less water perhaps. Some people just downvote people they don't like/agree with. Its silly, but I've seen it happen.   None of those are really good reason to downvote, but sometimes thats all it takes."

victoriajustice,30cyuv,-OP_pls-,4,Thu Mar 26 10:50:30 2015 UTC,"Interview Here   It’s fitting, considering she herself is embracing an edgier style as of late. “I always had to be conscious of that younger audience and couldn’t go too mature,” she says. “Now that I have a show on MTV, I am no longer part of that world as much. If I want to wear something that is low cut or show a little more skin, I embrace. I own it.”     That explains all the outfits recently. Go on and embrace Victoria!   And new music is on the horizon, too. “I’ve been telling my fans for such a long time that I’m going to be releasing music, so just wait—it’s coming! I think now is the time.”   YES! We have been waiting awhile, just release it yourself for now and get a label later."

victoriajustice,30bsbf,supersoaker727,3,Thu Mar 26 08:45:42 2015 UTC,"So you think if she did porn, she would let some rando who had money fuck her? I don't think she would. And if she ran out of money, she's well established by now and could get another tv show/movie."
victoriajustice,30bsbf,agkman,12,Thu Mar 26 13:50:32 2015 UTC,"She needs to keep working these photo shoots.  Honestly, looking amazing is what she does best.  Dat Kode shoot, especially the behind the scenes gifs & stills was just fire."

Have you been paying attention to their gallery of celebrities in the past decade or so? If she ever poses for that magazine, there is a 96.875 probability that she'll be no more naked than that Kode photoshoot."

victoriajustice,2zl86u,Lamachus,5,Thu Mar 19 21:37:59 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Eye Candy, for all its problems. But I think her real talent is for comedy, and fun stuff like this. As was mentioned earlier, Vic's goofiness is cute. She does goofy/silly well. Not all actors have the chops for that."
victoriajustice,2zl86u,DiamondRyce,2,Thu Mar 19 23:03:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I tried to get into Eye Candy, i liked the concept... but Victoria wasn't meant to do those dark, serious roles. She either seemed to be trying too hard to play up the dramatics, or she came off as bland and uninspired. She has a bubbly personality, it just seems off when she tries to be anything else. Comedy will always be where she excels IMO."
victoriajustice,2zl86u,Lamachus,1 point,Fri Mar 20 01:23:09 2015 UTC,Remember that was like her first show outside of comedy of course its hard to adapt. We have seen her mostly in comedies which is why its hard to see her in Eye Candy.  I like anything she does so it doesn't matter to me what happens next.
victoriajustice,2zl86u,skiier23,2,Fri Mar 20 03:29:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to imply that Vic can't do dramatic roles. I just really like her in light, fun stuff, and think she has a gift for it.  Actually, I was just glad to see her in anything new. Unless I missed something, Vic's last acting appearance was in that Big Time Rush episode from June 2013--a year and a half ago. It was a pleasure to have 10 hours of her company."
victoriajustice,2zl86u,Dedbent,2,Sat Mar 21 03:29:50 2015 UTC,"i got 30-45 seconds of her company in real life once at a mall she was randomly meeting anyone who showed up. even got a hug. gave her a little extra squeeze but not too much to where it was weird. its the little things in life like that, i think. :) anyway, back to her acting yeah i mean i always thought i could watch her host or whatever a documentary about how napkins are made but i agree with OP that she seemed like she was trying too hard in eyecandy and the whole show was just trying too hard."

victoriajustice,2t34yr,DiamondRyce,2,Tue Jan 20 20:17:25 2015 UTC,Drake gave her a shout out and now they are following each other on Twitter. Let the bogus rumors begin.
victoriajustice,2t34yr,Dedbent,2,Thu Jan 22 18:37:17 2015 UTC,Pretty Much. People want them to collab already and some are already saying Drake is shading Ariana and Big Sean with his tweet he said to victoria. Facepalms
victoriajustice,2t34yr,Dedbent,1 point,Thu Jan 22 19:12:51 2015 UTC,"I saw a seven page thread on a hip-hop forum congratulating Drake for ""smashing that"". I am sure he replied and followed her is because she is gorgeous. The same reason Bieber and Harry Styles follow her."

victoriajustice,2sfcn8,Dedbent,3,Wed Jan 14 18:38:23 2015 UTC,Premiering against the Championship game wasn't such a bright idea. Though from the overwhelming  positive response on Twitter. There might be an uptick in the ratings.
victoriajustice,2sfcn8,DiamondRyce,2,Wed Jan 14 18:45:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was unfortunate but people seem to forget that this live tv and it doesn't count for digital sales and all those free streams and piracy if you go that route for reasons.   Live TV is one form of entertainment nowadays with more content coming to different places like YouTube and Twitch, MLG etc  Sure the viewership could be better if it was a better date with nothing on TV happening. Lets hope for the best."

I'll hang on and keep watching. Victoria's acting isn't bad, not like I was expecting a whole lot going from Nickelodeon over to a dark, gritty MTV show.

She could have maybe tagged the people she was answering, so it would be a little easier to follow... or better yet, live chat.  I'm interested to see what future projects she has planned.

Although, it did bother me that they didn't even mention that they met Andre and Trina as different characters before, as well."
victoriajustice,2n546d,kenba2099,2,Sun Nov 23 08:49:02 2014 UTC,The only reason I watched the episode
victoriajustice,2n546d,rodinj,2,Sun Nov 23 20:22:10 2014 UTC,They should be wrestling in Jell-O.
victoriajustice,2n10wg,Dedbent,4,Fri Nov 21 22:20:12 2014 UTC,I'm probably more excited than I should be.
victoriajustice,2n10wg,expletiveadded,2,Sat Nov 22 00:12:10 2014 UTC,As we all should be. What sort of evil bastard wouldn't be excited?
victoriajustice,2n10wg,Lamachus,2,Sat Nov 22 04:44:12 2014 UTC,Instagram Video<<<15 second version  Youtube<<<30 second version  Vic's Images from the Teaser<<<27 pics  2 Twitter Banners

victoriajustice,2mwctj,-OP_pls-,11,Thu Nov 20 18:30:18 2014 UTC,Actually just realized how creepy this is... it's like a time lapse and someone just followed her taking constant pictures  spooky
victoriajustice,2mwctj,expletiveadded,8,Fri Nov 21 06:41:23 2014 UTC,I had to
victoriajustice,2mwctj,expletiveadded,2,Fri Nov 21 08:44:10 2014 UTC,Well I'm glad you did
victoriajustice,2mwctj,throwawayacc69,8,Fri Nov 21 15:48:48 2014 UTC,Not a single bad shot.
victoriajustice,2mwctj,agkman,2,Fri Nov 21 03:48:55 2014 UTC,"Is this a photoshoot or something? She had some pretty good product placement of that cup, and she didn't take one bite or sip from the drink.  If you notice, the cookie bite never gets bigger, and the levels in the cup are the same the entire time."
victoriajustice,2mwctj,500ft_tall_creature,1 point,Sat Nov 22 00:57:30 2014 UTC,or they simply took pictures of her walking a block or two.
victoriajustice,2mwctj,expletiveadded,2,Sat Nov 22 01:44:09 2014 UTC,It's weird she decided not to eat the cookie though.
victoriajustice,2mwctj,agkman,1 point,Sun Nov 23 01:27:03 2014 UTC,If this is a photoshoot for an ad. It's not a very good one. Victoria makes for a horrible model in the regard that I never once noticed the branding on the drink.
victoriajustice,2mxd4n,Dedbent,2,Thu Nov 20 23:23:00 2014 UTC,"From her twitter: ""I don’t think you guys are ready for this... #TOMORROW @MTVEyeCandy @MTV """

victoriajustice,2mtzao,TweetPoster,1 point,Thu Nov 20 01:42:46 2014 UTC,This could mean the actual movie or just a trailer to it on MTV so we will see.
victoriajustice,2mtzao,agkman,1 point,Thu Nov 20 01:49:00 2014 UTC,"That makes no sense at all, for one, we've heard absolutely nothing about it and it would be less than 2 weeks away.  VJ would have mentioned it, and MTV would be advertising it."
victoriajustice,2mtzao,arrayed,1 point,Thu Nov 20 02:11:17 2014 UTC,Private Screening..?
victoriajustice,2mtzao,Dedbent,1 point,Thu Nov 20 02:56:59 2014 UTC,idk. possibly
victoriajustice,2mtzao,Dedbent,1 point,Thu Nov 20 03:16:43 2014 UTC,"It would make sense if MTV Films picked it up. Viacom seems invested in Victoria. I don't think it would come out before Eye Candy, but you never know."

victoriajustice,2men55,agkman,2,Sat Nov 15 21:27:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah, he was always getting ""handsy"" with her on the show. Here goes that Keek."
victoriajustice,2men55,agkman,1 point,Sat Nov 15 21:45:20 2014 UTC,"Yeah he was.  Pics are starting to show up from the event, I hate to say it, but she really needs to drop her stylist and make up artist, I don't know what they're doing to her anymore."
victoriajustice,2mexa8,Dedbent,2,Sat Nov 15 22:08:50 2014 UTC,Depressing ... was hoping for legs.   Thanks anyway. :)
