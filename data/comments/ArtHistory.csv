Obviously, not every graduate from the leading departments are going to obtain tenure-track or curatorial positions, for the simple reason that even within such departments it is very evident that different individuals have differing priorities, approaches to their career, and, quite simply, ability--what you'd call the ""chops."" With that said, my observation has been that the ones who do their due diligence and have the abilities to back that up (and are graduating from the top departments) typically do end up securing good positions.   It's just not true that ""Harvard...grads are struggling to get placed."" It just isn't, so I'm not sure what else I can say about that.  As for postdocs: it is almost the norm today to do a postdoc or two after the defense. More often than not, it leads to a TT position within 3 years of defense (the usual time-frame considered barring the ones who land TT offers right out of the gate). So it's not at all something to be dismissed.  ""Economic security"" is a whole other matter. There is literally no field that offers bullet-proof economic security, simply because there are so many factors for which one must control.   Nonetheless, if one wishes to build a career in the history of art, just about the safest thing one can do is to pursue a PhD at a leading department, for a variety of reasons (material support, professional network, and placement history)."

Now, of the three, TT offers might come right away or after 1, 2, or even 3 postdocs. My own department just added a TT AP recently after their third postdoc. It's not at all uncommon.  So, those and other difficulties make any attempt at ""accurate"" record keeping more or less a thankless and impractical task.  With that said, my own ""evidence"" amounts to knowledge of my own department and about half a dozen peer departments, which collectively more or less comprise the top departments in this discipline in the US.

It is not worth doing a PhD in the humanities if you're not doing it at one of the top schools.   -In order to continue beyond a bachelor's degree in the field, you will need to hone your interests and figure out what specific period/location interests you the most.

Add to the list Michelangelo in the 17-18th centuries ('vulgar!'), Rodin (after his death he was lumped in with the Academics by the moderns, until as late as the 1950s and 60's when he made a comeback in a big big way, now considered one of the greatest in history)... My favorite though (simply because of the contrast between his exaggerated importance then and his anonymity now) has to be Alfred Stevens. Who? Exactly.

Pretty much the entire history of American art meets the second of these. Take Richard Caton Woodville, an artist on whom I write quite a bit. When he died at the untimely age of 30 in 1855 he was a well-regarded young artist on the rise. By the 1870s no one had heard of him. In 2009 Alice Walton bought his work War News From Mexico for tens of millions of dollars, and the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore recently had an exhibit of his entire known ouevre.

ArtHistory,3dtonn,pipkin42,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:14:32 2015 UTC,"Ernest Meissonier is kind of a famous example. He was one of the highest paid artists in France, but his reputation (and prices) crashed almost immediately after his death in 1891. There is a highly entertaining book about him called The Judgment of Paris by Ross King ( http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/10/books/10book.html?_r=0 ). His painting Friedland, 1807 sold for 380,000 francs, which was the highest price ever paid for a painting at the time, I believe. The buyer was an American, and the painting is now in the Met. Unlike Bouguereau, his reputation hasn't been resurrected. But his paintings are enjoyable to look at.   ""And bonus points if you can name an artist who has had a double reversal, ie died in obscurity, was latterly feted, but then returned to obscurity...or an artist who was lauded during his lifetime, ignored after, and now is popular again! ""  I can't think of the former at all, but there is a cottage industry devoted to the latter. There are artists who have their moment and get a lot of reviews, then fall off the radar. Maybe they end up teaching art in some provincial college, still producing new work but no longer getting the reviews they got when they were young.   Then along comes some young art history doctoral candidate looking to make a rep. One way to do it is look through old issue of Artnews or whatever for artists who were getting praise back in the 50s or 60s but who fell off the map. Then you write a reconsideration of their work. If you're lucky, it works and that artist rejoins the canon.   Often it will be a woman artist, an artist of color, or a gay artist--artists who could be said to be victims of the art world's historic sexism or racism.   Forrest Bess is an example--Had several well-received shows with Betty Parsons Gallery in the 50s, disappears from the scene after 1961 or so (when his studio/living space was wiped off the map by Carla), but then in 2012, Robert Gober curated a small exhibit within and exhibit at the Whitney Biennial of Bess's work, which was followed a couple of years latter by a major travelling retrospective originating at Menil. Gober's interest had to do with Bess's sexuality and isolation (he lived in rural coastal Texas), and how this was reflected in his work. This is a subject that presumably didn't come up at the high point of his career back in the 1950s.  This might not fit your description, since Bess was never a household name, but he was someone whose work was held in esteem, forgotten, then remembered decades later."

ArtHistory,3dswlu,CalProsper,3,Sun Jul 19 03:33:11 2015 UTC,"Giotto is part of the early humanist impulse that bridges the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The development of humanism was buttressed by the recovery of classical texts and culture, but it also reflected a religious concern with this world, which was present in certain aspects of late medieval art. Giotto, for example, has been seen as a painter influenced by the Franciscan tradition, which emphasizes human concerns and emotions. Think of Giotto as developing humanist values rather than being ""influenced"" by them. That is how later writers like Villani (c.1400) would see him, as a pioneer akin to Petrarch.    On the topic of Giotto and humanism see: Michael Baxandall, Giotto and the Orators.   edit: syntax."
ArtHistory,3dswlu,Adarga,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:08:42 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply. I think part of my confusion was I read a book which stated that Constantinople fell in 1204 or so and Byzantine artists migrated to Italy. However, after looking into it on the web it seems there are a few sources that say the Byzantine migration took place around the late 15th century when Constantinople actually fell. With the migration came a number of scholars who would've had texts on classical thought, I believe.   So, my confusion rests mainly on whether the migration coincided only with the final fall of Constantinople or with both the 15th century fall and the Crusader siege in the early 13th century."
ArtHistory,3dswlu,Adarga,3,Mon Jul 20 03:02:43 2015 UTC,"There are no monofactorial explanations in history. In the case of humanism, think about it as a growing attitude that reflected different ideas (some civic, some religious) emerging through a long period of time.   The Fall of Constantinople in the 15th century had traditionally been seen as the decisive event that motivated many scholars to travel to Italy, bringing classical texts with them. This is often taught in schools, but it is a ""white lie"" that simplifies a very complex situation.   What has come to be called ""humanism"" (itself a loaded term) can be further traced to the Middle Ages. Look up ""Medieval Renaissances"" and ""12th Century Renaissance."" The contacts with the Islamic world, through trade or military conflicts like the Crusades, led to the rediscovery, in the Middle Ages, of classical philosophy, as well as exposure to Islamic technology, science, and math.   In the turbulent 14th century, humanist ideas would become reified in the cultural circles of Europe. In artistic terms, Giotto's art created a spark that popularized what we today may call a ""humanist attitude."""
ArtHistory,3dsarc,Adamkranz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:48:08 2015 UTC,"Great question. The Romantic era certainly did offer landscapes that portray the destructive, forceful, and powerful elements of nature. This type of landscape scene is usually referred to as sublime, as oppose to picturesque.   Definitely check out JMW Turner's work. He's created many intense, relatively terrifying, sublime scenes--mostly of seascapes.  Frederick Edwin Church is also a good artist to check out. The first painting that comes to mind is Niagara Falls, which is a decent depiction of intimidation and power.  Most of the other major artists from the Hudson River School will have their own take on the sublime, so it's worth checking them out as well."
ArtHistory,3dsarc,ididntsignupforthat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:54:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!   I'd always understood the sublime to almost represent the opposite of evil? Landscapes glorifying wild nature became possible because people started to view wilderness as evidence of God's majesty rather than the previous conception as places to be feared and conquered. John Muir's Yosemite Valley was hardly a demon-haunted landscape. I don't see much that's sinister, for instance, about Bierstadt's paintings. Or Church's, for that matter.  That said, I'm sure this category is a fruitful place to look. John Martin seems to be somewhere along the right track. At the risk of moving the goalposts, I'm gonna say storms alone aren't sufficient - I'm looking for something a bit more spiritually threatening than just materially?   Friedrich's work seems to define the haunting and foreboding aspect I'm looking for, but he doesn't seem to have intended it that way? I think it's mostly all the ruined churches. . ."
ArtHistory,3dsarc,ididntsignupforthat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:58:31 2015 UTC,"In regard to the definition of sublime, I tend to follow the traditional Romantic meaning posed by Edmund Burke; he ""connected the sublime with experiences of awe, terror and danger.

ArtHistory,3dq3ou,dove779,5,Sat Jul 18 10:12:09 2015 UTC,"I actually just finished a class that was basically philosophy & art history, it went over this in depth. I'll try to summarize what I remember here!  So this debate started with Plato who said that artists were basically charlatans who made useless copies of real things that already weren't as good as they could be (or as good as they were in the ""realm of forms""), and that artists should strive to represent objects in their ideal state.  Later Aristotle said that artists could basically do what they wanted, whether that was representing things as better than they are, the same as they are, or worse as they are.  In general, the Greeks used idealized figures, and the Romans were more realistic.  In the Renaissance, some of the most famous artists were involved in this debate.  Leonardo da Vinci was on the side of realistic representations based on scientific observations.  Raphael and Michelangelo were adamant that beauty was more important.  Raphael in particular advocated for selectivity - looking at several models and picking the most beautiful parts of each to build an idealized figure in his art.  After the Renaissance there was a brief period of art referred to as Mannerism (including paintings like Madonna with the Long Neck) where style and beauty was seen as more important than realism, to the point that figures were distorted in order to look more beautiful.  Rococo and Baroque art were more concerned with issues of whether art should appear soft and ""painterly"" or more linear, with clearly outlined forms.  Most artists emphasized beauty over realism.  Neoclassical artists deliberately used idealized figures, but that had more to do with the seeing ancient Greek art (which was idealized) as beautiful and wanting to replicate that beauty.  It wasn't until the Realists (example- The Stone Breakers by Gustave Courbet) that the tides changed and representing reality became more important than idealism.  Artists like Courbet and Manet painted everyday, working class people (this was related to Marxism), it caused an uproar at first but eventually became the dominant type of art.    This trend continued through modern and postmodern art, all the way to today.  While some modern and postmodern art isn't what most people would call ""realistic"", since it's largely nonrepresentational, it is definitely striving to represent reality, just in new ways.  Pollock, for example, was trying to show his reality of the process of painting, not an idealized version of the experience of creating art.  Of course modernism and postmodernism were much more complicated than I can go into here, and there were plenty of artists that incorporated idealization into their work (Gauguin, for example, painted idealized interpretations of life in the South Pacific, though his figures weren't idealized in the same way earlier paintings were). And like earlier eras, the focus of art of the 20th & 21st centuries has been more about the qualities of art itself rather than what that art is representing, which complicates things further.  I hope that helps!  If you want more information, I'll let you know what readings we used and some of the specific artworks we looked at."
ArtHistory,3dq3ou,Adarga,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:01:31 2015 UTC,"I recommend two easy to read and well illustrated books by Umberto Eco: History of Beauty and On Ugliness. Also, Donald Preziosi's The Art of Art History and Stephen Ross' Art and Its Significance are good anthologies.   In any case, be aware that your proposed tension does not exist.

ArtHistory,3dp95w,DireBeats,5,Sat Jul 18 06:42:15 2015 UTC,"I actually did a post-grad program about this at ARCA and can tell you a fair bit about it!  The number one reason is, as people have stated, for the money. Stolen art work typically fences for 10% of its market value, so while you might not be able to get the million bucks for a painting, a hundred grand is still a lot of cash. Also if its not properly reported to the police (because for example people dont want the public to know they have expensive paintings), then it can be sold for market value because the art world is terrible at doing due dilligence.  As kittenmonger pointed out in another comment, it can also be used as a trade commodity. A lot of art is smuggled out to Eastern Europe and traded for diamonds (the Pink Panthers are well known for this). Art in general is being used more frequently in modern time to launder money as well. Sales of artwork is kept very secretive (both sellers and buyers), and there is never a question as to where the cash comes from, so a lot of criminal organizations are using auction houses as a way to launder their cash into artwork that can be resold after so many years.  Another reason is for the love of art. There was a French art thief named Stephane Breitwieser who stole somewhere over 100 objects (which cost around 1.4 billion total), kept all of them, didnt sell a single thing. He wrote a book called ""Confessions of an Art Thief"" if you want to find out more.  Then there's also political reasons! Rose Dugdale being the best example I can give of this. She was a member of the IRA who stole a bunch of artwork in order to try and use it as ransom to release IRA members who had been arrested.  Art theft is a major part of my work, so if you have any more questions about this I'd be super happy to answer, I'm very much in love with the subject."

Alternately it can be ransomed back to museums/collectors

ArtHistory,3dg4o9,Weeperblast,6,Thu Jul 16 00:25:20 2015 UTC,"the term Dada is really associated with particular people living in Europe in the early 20th century. But people make art using dadaist ideas and techniques (like using chance to make aesthetic choices, using shock or surprise to keep audiences on their toes, collage, found poetry, etc.) If you feel like you recognize a Dadaist influence in something you are drawn to, you probably aren't wrong, because the aesthetic has been in the culture for 100 years."
ArtHistory,3dg4o9,smackie,6,Thu Jul 16 02:12:27 2015 UTC,"Actually Dada is notable for being the first truly international art movement.  International meant several European countries, but also included the US, particularly NYC.  I agree that the influence is so pervasive today that it would be hard to isolate something and call it Dada.  I think of Fluxus as having particularly strong roots in Dadaism, so I would look there if you are not already very familiar with Fluxus work.  There is work that has been labeled ""neo-Dada"" -- you could look at that too.  Hans Richter moved to the US in the 40s and taught.  I'd look at his influence.  Of course, Duchamp is important, as well.  If I remember correctly, he was not self-declared as part of the movement but was obviously very influential to Dada."

ArtHistory,3dghkd,Galious,3,Thu Jul 16 21:54:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to make a difference with an unconscious western-centric bias and racism.   This is exactly what is currently so well-debated within scholarly circles. The conscious/unconscious of racism. Think of it as analogous in a very general sense with the concept of the optical unconscious (to allude to something more familiar). Racism is not restricted to one's elderly grandmother talking about the coons and the cotton-pickers. Racism manifests in innumerable microscopic senses that we're only just beginning to articulate and push into the spotlight. That ""unconscious Western-centric bias"" is precisely the Orientalism that Said critiqued (along with many others). It's evident in Gauguin (Spirit of the Dead Watching, most famously).   So in a sense, yes. The entire history of Western culture is one of racism--its constitution, exercise, and perpetuation. It's something that art history as a discipline is beginning to rectify, thankfully. For instance, the Renaissance is now being investigated much more in its transnational context rather than as a European or West-centered rupture in the history of art.  Bucolism, pastoralism, are intimately bound up with a deeply conservative ideology (and, as we know, conservative thought is often shot through with racist attitudes).  If anything, it behooves us to explore precisely the ""racist overtone[s] in almost everything done by the western world."""

Do we fall in a world similar to marketing, where instead of painting what I want, I must make safe multi-cultural scene that hurts nobody?"
ArtHistory,3dghkd,Galious,3,Fri Jul 17 13:26:41 2015 UTC,"what am I supposed, as an artist, to do of this information? am I now forbidden to paint a bucolic landscape?   The artists who enter critical discussion (e.g., Kara Walker, to pick just one recently-popularized name) do so by responding to the history of art in their practice. Walker's silhouette work had long troubled several areas of artistic practice and historicity: medium, flatness, color, volume, space, whatever--while also taking up the history of race, especially race in America. Her latest installation just pushed it to another level.  Critical art engages with the history of art. So yes, of course you can paint a bucolic landscape--but it will only matter, critically, if you somehow respond to what we understand now of the racism that inheres in such paintings. If you don't, it's either a meaningless imitation, or an uncritical perpetuation of the very problems we identify today.    must I stop liking bucolic painting of past masters?   Obviously not! Nobody's going to loathe Gauguin just because of the West-centered, racist worldview that pervades ""Spirit of the Dead Watching."" We're just more aware of it. It's perfectly possible to admire DW Griffith while remaining aware of what position Birth of a Nation occupies in the history of race and cinema.

ArtHistory,3d8kky,Fyrwit,3,Tue Jul 14 10:10:16 2015 UTC,"I couldn't find a good article about this particular episode of Fake or Fortune? that wasn't behind a paywall but essentially, the hour long programme is based around the premise of taking what is known about a work believed to be by a great artist and then using a mix of paper-trail hunting and scientific analysis to try and make a case for it to be recognised or to prove it a fake. In this episode a painting by Renoir is comprehensively proved to be by the man himself but the Wildenstein Institute refused to change their refusal to include it in Renoir's catalogue raisonné.  I found it really interesting to see the investigative work that goes into piecing together a work's history and the feuding between the authorities was eye-opening. I thought it might be of interest here for anyone wondering how works are authenticated.  Edit to add: The episode on YouTube for those who can't access the BBC iplayer."

ArtHistory,3d4unv,not_acatlady,3,Mon Jul 13 21:39:05 2015 UTC,"I love thematic posts like this.  #2 was my favorite.  The way the waves are rendered makes them seem so abstract, I've never really seen such a huge value range applied to waves that way.  Also, even though I've seen it countless times, it was only recently brought to my attention that Hokusai's wave is almost a perfect golden ratio spiral, and if you flip the image vertically the negative space of the sky makes a very similar wave shape to the actual water one.  My personal favorite wave painting is Ilya Repin's ""What Freedom"": https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Ilya_Repin-What_freedom%21.jpg I guess it's more of a character painting but I've always loved the way the waves were painted.

If he wasn't an artist he would be the kind of malicious construction developer you read about in angry liberal press.  I personally loathe his work for the NYC gates which contaminated one of the few islands of green in Manhattan with hundreds of gates the color of construction cones, while the man himself gave disgusting interviews about how ""from a helicopter"" the gates look beautiful. Because everyone in NYC that matters (to Cristo, anyway), is enjoying Central park from a helicopter. Oh and a number of my bohemian peers volunteered for it, only to sell sandwiches for eight hours straight, a lucky few got to do hard manual labor mounting the gates: all for the privilege of getting to do hard manual labor!

On the one hand, I do feel and recall the gates as beautiful to walk through and witness, but to consider the environmental damage caused by wrapping entire areas in cloth really changes my perspective of his work as a whole.

ArtHistory,3cli6g,mugcup,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:50:12 2015 UTC,"Why do you want to a PhD in this discipline? If it is to pursue an academic career or a curatorial career afterward, you need to be very careful about selecting your program. Names matter (name of the institution, of your faculty, of your advisor, etc.) because they open doors and allow access that may otherwise prove difficult. As well, some institutions can provide a level of funding that ensures you do not have to worry about your everyday life and sustenance. Not to mention, of course, that some programs simply are at the leading edge of X, Y, Z sub-fields (e.g. medieval, renaissance, modern, etc.).   So unless you specify what time period(s) or geographical region(s) you are interested in (and by ""interested in,"" I mean ""have studied extensively, are familiar with the current conversations, have or can produce a superb academic paper that can serve as your writing sample, and have developed a compelling, relevant research proposal that will serve as your statement of purpose""), it's difficult to offer anything.  Just about every university has a PhD program in the history of art. That doesn't mean it's worth doing one at any university."
ArtHistory,3cli6g,PhDforaDay,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:40:59 2015 UTC,"Oh yes, funded. And yes, I'm not a native speaker. Anyway, let me try to make the question a bit more clear. For example, if you get accepted to the University of Toronto you automatically get a scholarship and paid TA positions (at least it was like that the last time I checked) while if you get accepted to the University of Edinburgh you compete for different scholarship later, and there is a big chance you will have to pay the fees (at least for the first year). So, I'm looking for Toronto-like programs if you know of them. Does that make sense?"

ArtHistory,3cli6g,mugcup,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:12:18 2015 UTC,"There's no math involved here, not that any would be possible given the sheer logistical complexities of tenure-track hiring and landing curatorial positions, etc. Generally, the US PhD is viewed as being more rigorous and founded upon greater breadth that later leads to a focused specialization. As well, US PhDs teach extensively during their graduate career. Simply put, US PhD structure allows one to do more. This is in contrast to the much more utilitarian (and, evidently, more limited) scope of the UK PhD.   Noting the circulation of recent tenure-track hires as well as those hired to curatorial positions, you'll see that the majority of them were trained in the US (excepting senior lateral moves)."

There is a lot of interesting mechanical problem solving that goes on during exhibition design and building. You might get the opportunity to build custom display elements and design special light riggings. The building teams work closely with the curator so its a pretty fascinating collaboration. Could be fun for a summer internship.   Best of luck! I'm an art history PhD student and my partner is a mechanical engineer so these disciplinary cross-overs come up quite a bit.

Basically we'll say an art museum since that is what you're interested in would come to him and say ""Hey we have this painting we want to show off but we need censors so no one touches it. Also we want spot lights on it so it is really bright to make the colors pop but it need to be timed well and have dispersion as to not sun fade it over time.""  Then he'd go find the needed lighting systems, censors, mountings and whatever else and come up with a design for it to make it look good to visitors but also preserve the quality.

As for specific artworks, I was blown away but most of the collection in the MoMA and the Met was overwhelmingly impressive. The Guggenheim also has many major artworks, but I found the viewing experience less pleasurable due to crowds and the forced flow of the museum."
ArtHistory,3c1nz3,AmenteAmant,2,Fri Jul 3 23:14:16 2015 UTC,the Met has amazing history spanning across all geographies and periods and encompassing both art and artefact.  I would 110% start there.
ArtHistory,3c1nz3,setz32,2,Fri Jul 3 23:24:02 2015 UTC,"If Modern and/or American is your thing, definitely check out the new Whitey museum. It's absolutely amazing. MoMA of course is great too, but always way overcrowded. The Met has something for everyone, and it's pay-what-you-wish, which is nice.   The Guggenheim is kind of only worth going to if you're interested in whatever their temporary exhibition in the rotunda is. The first time I went it was ""Black & White Picasso"" which was fine, but I was kind of done after seeing about 10 paintings. Currently their temporary exhibition is contemporary art from their collection based on storytelling.   If contemporary art is your thing, the New Museum has had a lot of really great exhibitions in the past couple of years (plus it's small, and you can see the whole thing in about an hour).   If you're up for something a little more off the beaten path (and again, if contemporary art is your thing) the Park Avenue Armory currently has a show of Philippe Parreno's work that I've heard is pretty incredible."

ArtHistory,3brapg,hashbag,8,Wed Jul 1 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"As far as getting a PhD in art history goes, I think your plan is a fine one, even recommended. If you want to work in a museum after getting your PhD it is best to have several years of museum experience before commencing the PhD.  I would really urge you not to get a PhD in art history (or in most other fields). Only do it if you have a partner or other family who can lend you a great deal of financial support during and after your years of study. The job market for PhDs right now is just brutal, and many highly qualified people can't find anything that suits their qualifications. You must be prepared for disappointment, living a financially precarious existence, and moving frequently.   By all means, get the Master's, but only if you or your family can pay for it without going into deep debt. See how you like grad school. If you do, maybe you will decide to get the PhD anyway. After all, despite the many challenges, I have found getting a PhD a richly and intensely rewarding experience, even if I end up working in a field outside of academia or museums. But be very careful. Don't do a PhD program for which you are not fully funded. Going into debt to study art history (as I did) is a mistake you will likely regret."
ArtHistory,3brapg,pipkin42,6,Wed Jul 1 16:07:31 2015 UTC,"This:   get the Master's, but only if you or your family can pay for it without going into deep debt."
ArtHistory,3brapg,Adarga,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:35:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. It's very helpful! And I actually looked into a lot of Ph.D. programs (in all of those fields listed above - geophysics, physics, math, applied math, higher education, linguistics, etc.) and a lot of them seem to fund the candidates 100%, which is why I thought maybe I could pull that off after going to college for my bachelors and then grad school for masters."
ArtHistory,3brapg,fixmycupofcaffeine,5,Wed Jul 1 18:44:28 2015 UTC,"Humanities programs also fund 100%. The cardinal rule for going for a PhD is that if you don't get funding, you don't do it. If you get accepted to a program but don't get funding, that's really a polite rejection letter."
ArtHistory,3brapg,jonvox,3,Wed Jul 1 20:13:45 2015 UTC,"I got my Master's at the Institute of Fine Arts and I had practically no formal art history experience at all. My undergraduate degree was in Anthropology and my thesis was a cultural investigation of two archaeological sites. People jump fields all the time when they enter grad school and the important part is to prove that you have a grasp of that field and can succeed in it.  What's going to matter are your letters of recommendation (one from your museum director/boss should look great) and your writing sample. Write an art history paper if you don't have one. And most importantly, assert an original claim."
ArtHistory,3brapg,dancingintheforest,3,Wed Jul 1 16:07:41 2015 UTC,I agree with pipkin42. I graduated from a MA in Art History. I had thought that I wanted to do a PhD but the financial hardships that accompany it can be very difficult from many I know who are PhDs in the field. I switched around heavily in undergraduate. It actually was a benefit in some respects because I knew other subjects that helped the seminar discussions in novel ways. Yet I would recommend reading heavily in modern and contemporary art and philosophy once you are accepted and before you attend.
ArtHistory,3brapg,KaliMau,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:31:30 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I've been reading a lot of books and papers and going to local contemporary art events but I still have a long, long way to go."
ArtHistory,3brapg,fixmycupofcaffeine,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:46:26 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion, but maybe get your work experience at the university where you want to get your education.

I worked with many student workers, several getting their Ph.D's for almost no cost."
ArtHistory,3brapg,deputygus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"This is not a silly plan at all! You're right that the most prestigious museum jobs generally require a PhD. However, I would also caution against going for a PhD with the sole end-goal in mind of getting one of those jobs. You need to make sure that you really really love the field and really really love doing research as well, and are willing to make the 6+ year commitment.   If you think that you'll have a hard time getting into a Master's program because you don't have a ton of experience in Art History (which I don't think you necessarily will, people enter into Master's programs with unrelated undergrad degrees all the time)  I'd suggest looking at Museum Studies/Museum Education/Museum Professions programs since it sounds like that's perhaps what you'd like to end up doing anyhow. However, these kinds of programs tend to be less research-based than Art History MA programs, and would entail different kind of course work than you would do in a PhD program. Don't know where you're currently located, but I can tell you more about a few of those kinds of programs on the East Coast if you're interested.   I'll echo what was said above that if you and/or your family can pay for an MA degree without going into a ton of debt (and if you don't have a ton of debt already from your undergrad) go for it. Also, don't worry too much about the prestige of the Master's program. If you're going to stop there, I'd say it matters a little more, but it's not impossible to get into a top PhD program from a mid-level BA or MA program. Just about all of my professors did their BA and/or MA at state schools and small liberal arts colleges, and PhDs at Ivy Leagues.   Another quite note of advice: this is a field where networking matters a whole lot. You need to make an effort to get to know your professors (and your supervisors at the museums/galleries you've been working at) so that they can write stellar letters of recommendation. If you look good on paper (which most people applying do) a personal note from one of your professors to someone that they know at the program where you're applying, or the museum where you're hoping to get a job will go a really long way and set you apart from the rest of the pack.   Also, if modern and contemporary art is your thing and you're wondering what you should be reading, I'm more than happy to give suggestions/recommendations!   Good luck!"
ArtHistory,3brapg,lovetosaydada,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:52:40 2015 UTC,"echoing other posts: ""Extremely doable"" After completing my BFA I interned at a museum and quickly decided art history, not art making, was my path. I had also only completed the minimum art history courses required for studio magers. Because of this I audited some classes afterward to prove that continued schooling was what I wanted. Remember there's never going to be a full foundation; every generation builds upon the previous so everyone feels weak outside their area of focus. Schools will also focus on your outside activities, such as related work, internships, and volunteer hours, to make their decision."

To continue /u/escalatordad's suggestions along the lines of a broader, less-visual understanding of repetition, OP, you might consider checking out Walter Benjamin's essay ""Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"" as well (or you could check out the first episode of John Berger's ""Ways of Seeing,"" which is an excellent articulation of Benjamin's thought. If you were in to that and wanted to think about performance, you could also check out Peggy Phelan's argument that the ontology of performance is inherently nonreproductive (in her book Unmarked, although if I remember correctly she published that chapter as an essay prior to its inclusion in the book)."
ArtHistory,3bnanj,Priorwater,3,Tue Jun 30 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"Good call on Benjamin. I wasn't thinking about copies when I replied.    Just remembered another (very short) text about repetition, one of the cards from Eno's Oblique Strategies: ""Repetition is a form of change.""

It's so funny because my experience with the piece was actually quite different from what it's title might suggest. It just had me thinking about the way bars often put a mirror behind their liquor bottles, and how cool that looks. It was fun to move my head around and see the reflections twist around on the glass. In fact, the piece was sort of proof that objects aren't perfectly repeatable--compare two identical ""bottles""--in fact, compare two different reflections of the same bottle!--and they were different because the light reflected differently. Each object in the viewer's field-of-view was always slightly different than every other object because each had it's own unique reflections.   Although, that wouldn't be true if the objects weren't reflective. It's interesting to think about how the medium affects the piece. If all the vases were wood, each object would have a unique grain. If all the vases were of a non-reflective, smooth iron, they might truly be impossible to tell apart.   I guess that's why Benjamin's work is so interesting: whereas two physical objects, say two glass vases, will always appear slightly different, in two identical photographs of a vase the light patterns can truly be the same."

ArtHistory,3baoe5,SrGatonegro,5,Sat Jun 27 15:39:51 2015 UTC,"I'd say I mostly agree with this list, except for Rodin's The Kiss and Van Gogh's Sunflowers. Delacroix's Liberty... seems to be pretty well known, but I'm not sure if I'd include it in a top ten either. I'd substitute those three with some artworks from /u/dclctcd's list, namely Van Gogh's The Starry Night, Wood's American Gothic and Vermeer's Girl... or Da Vinci's The Last Supper. I mean, I've seen The Starry Night EVERYWHERE, from posters to t-shirts and notebooks, American Gothic is frequently parodied in modern media, and The Last Supper and Girl with a Pearl Earring were prominently featured in Hollywood films."

ArtHistory,3b9cre,Maccai3,3,Sat Jun 27 04:02:12 2015 UTC,"a little information if you are unaware  Dali did 101 watercolours for Dante's Divine Comedy commissioned by the Italian government for Dante's 700th birthday.  The Italian public dissaproved of the news that Dante's work was being trusted to a spaniard and the government decided to pull out.  Dali continued with the work anyway and enlisted Raymond Jacquet and Jean Taricco who made 3500 blocks to create these prints.  The blocks were destroyed after they were used so there is somewhat of a limited run of these.  If i remember correctly they made 2 runs of 100 each, the original one and a later German one (the German ones are all print signed).  I'm no pro here but i think yours may be the German run."

It only teaches art history, so you get a very focused experience. It has it's own (also pretty famous) gallery, the core of which is Impressionist and Port-impressionist painting, so would be good for the period you're interested in. In my second year there were quite a few American exchange students, and as far as I knew they had a very positive time. I would definitely recommend looking into going there!  But so as not to seem completely biased - I'm just finishing my Masters studying abroad in the Netherlands, which you could also consider - most Masters are in English, BAs have a mixture of courses in English or Dutch so you'd need to check you could take / wanted to take enough. I don't know of anywhere here that's exceptionally famous for art history, but all the main cities (mostly in the two Holland provinces) have galleries etc. In general, I would definitely recommend studying abroad for at least a few months, it's a great way to see new places and meet new people, and maybe even learn a few new things ;)"

ArtHistory,3ale8z,fixmycupofcaffeine,3,Sun Jun 21 19:18:37 2015 UTC,"Going to tackle this piece by piece here, because these are things I wish I had been intelligent enough to ask when I was a sophomore...  Languages: French and German are both really good languages to learn if you're studying Art History. A Master's program will probably only require one, a PhD program will probably require both. My focus is postwar and contemporary art, and I've found French to be pretty useful. I don't know a word of German, but that hasn't hindered me in any way yet. Also worth keeping in mind that studying languages for research/reading purposes is significantly different (and easier) than learning them with the goal in mind that you will be able to speak them fluently. So, if you need to pick up another one along the way, shouldn't be a huge hurdle.   Study Abroad: That's awesome that you have Study Abroad opportunities lined up already. It's definitely worth doing as an Art History student. I honestly don't know that much about the Netherlands, but if you're into Impressionism (and other modern and contemporary art) Paris is a really great place to be. However, both places are in central Europe, and there's a good chance that you'll get to travel a bit during your study abroad program. I would base where you go on the university that you'll be studying at, and how appealing the actual program is to you.   Internships: Just start looking, and applying to everything that sounds interesting to you. If there's somewhere that you're potentially interested in interning, but they don't specifically have information about internships on their website, don't be afraid to email and ask them if they could use an intern/volunteer, as you're a student who would like to get experience and they appeal to you particularly for whatever reason. Don't get discouraged if you don't hear back from everywhere that you reply, or if you get rejection letters. Don't be afraid to ask your professors for help in searching, and for letters of recommendation. A major museum might not accept you if you don't have prior experience, so start small. If your university has an art museum (which most do) that might be a great place to start.   If you're not sure what exactly you want your focus to be (although you think you might be into modern and contemporary) GO TO MUSEUMS AND GALLERIES. You'll find that you come across things that you might not have talked about in class or read about in your textbooks that are interesting and that you really like, and you'll get to see things in person that you've already learned about. I cannot tell you how many times I've gotten inspiration for a paper or been able to see something that I was working on in a new way from wandering through a museum.    One last piece of advice: This is a field where networking is very important and connections matter a lot. Get to know your professors, especially if there are any that are ""big names"" at your school. When you're applying for things (internships, grad school, etc.) you might look great on paper, but if your professors can write you glowing letters of recommendation or maybe they know the head of the program and are willing to write them a personal note, that will significantly set you apart from the rest of the applicant pool (I have a personal story about this kind of situation that I'm hesitant to share here, but would be happy to tell you over PM if you're interested)."

ArtHistory,3ale8z,GoldenAgeGirl,3,Sun Jun 21 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"I would definitely check online first to see if galleries have intern and volunteer opportunities. Even if you show up armed with a cover letter and impressive CV/resume and you give it to the person working at the front desk, it could get lost, or maybe not ever make it to the person who actually deals with interns. If you contact them via email, it's a little bit more of a direct path. However, if there's not anything on their website about internships and volunteer opportunities, might not be a bad idea to ask who you could contact to inquiry about the possibility of such opportunities.   As for museum internships, I can't really say how common or not it is to get one. But like I said, it really helps to know people and to have someone who can put in a good word for you. Being close to the city is kind of both an advantage and a disadvantage, because there are so many resources and so many possible places to intern, but also so many incredibly smart and qualified people who want those internships. However, once you get your foot in the door at one place, other places are more likely to see you as a competitive candidate. So, it's tough, but not impossible.   Hope that's helpful!"

ArtHistory,3a793q,tartmechanic,3,Wed Jun 17 19:51:48 2015 UTC,"I know that Columbia has a Museum Anthropology which sounds like it might be related to what you want to get in to, and might be a good bridge between BA and PhD.   You might have a hard time jumping from an Art History BA directly to an Anthropology PhD program, but it might be a good idea to contact the schools that you're potentially interested in applying to and ask what the requirements are in terms of what undergraduate degree you have to have. At least in the humanities, it's not uncommon to do your graduate studies in something different than you did your undergrad degree in. (Anthropology/Archaeology might be different, I don't know what kind of base knowledge is expected).  Another possibility might be to pursue an Art History MA, and focus on indigenous art of North America or South America, and write about it for your thesis. This is where the personal statement in grad school applications comes in really useful-- you can explain that even though your BA and MA are not in Archaeology, that you have previously studied and written about the stuff that you're hoping to do more research on in your PhD program."

There are programs to suit any area of interest, or at least as far as I can tell from running into such topics while researching grad programs. I know Columbia University touts its strength in pre-Columbian and Native American art studies. I'd be pretty surprised if most schools in the western U.S. that offer graduate programs didn't offer a focus in this field, considering the deep connections western states have to Native American culture. I know that the schools I've looked into in the past -- University of Washington, University of California, and even Montana State University -- make mention of these sorts of focus areas. MSU actually even lists ""Ancient Mesoamerica"" as a subject on its MA for art history webpage. So, I think it's just a matter of looking around and being thorough in your search.

My advice would be to find a particular work of art, or defined body of works, and use that as a starting point to build outward with your ideas. So, ""I will show how such and such was influenced by culture and geography..."", and pull other works in through comparison.  The way you've phrased your question, it sounds like you are interested in working on non-Western art. Off the top of my head, you might be interested in Northern vs Southern style Chinese painting, Indigenous Australian art across time, the northern Pacific Rim connecting Asia to the Americas, or the geographic area of Afghanistan/Pakistan/Western India where the major trade routes connected East and West.   In my experience grading undergrad papers, the best writing really engaged with the visual evidence for their argument. Best of luck!"
ArtHistory,39yjbo,Corbitt,3,Mon Jun 15 21:58:43 2015 UTC,"First of all, thank you for taking your time to answer me, I really appreciate that. Actually I haven't decided yet what culture to work on, because after reading your answer, I just realized how big and massive it would be to establish some kind of ""rule"" of how each aspect can influence art. However, I trying not to focus on any culture, because the objective to describe how those aspects can shape art. So I'd ""prove"" my point by citing those influences in different cultures.   I came up with this subject when I was thinking of how people consider some kind of art ugly without knowing its background or even anything about it, and that they'd probably have the opposite opinion if the were raised in that culture. So I'd try to show how those aspects made the art in each part of the world advance in different directions with different purposes, and that'd be why you have different art tastes in different parts of the world (I think this would also work for subcultures).  I know it sounds too ambitious, but I'm trying to simplify it to make  possible. I'm just struggling a little bit with it."
ArtHistory,39yjbo,ColdWarConcrete,3,Mon Jun 15 22:59:38 2015 UTC,"If this is your interest you can take on Richard Serra's ""Tilted Arc"" and maybe focus on how the sculpture, limiting the path of individuals on their way to work, made audiences think it was ""ugly.""    I'd definitely keep away from looking at different cultures.  Even in 30 page paper, it would be difficult to tackle on more than one culture.  Perhaps it would be useful to look at a subculture in the U.S. and how they have responded to the artwork.  In order to simplify, you want to focus on something particular, not broader.  The immediate mistake I can point to in your argument with ""each part of the world advance in different directions with different purposes, and that'd be why you have different art tastes in different parts of the world"" is that there are also very similar takes in very different parts of the world.  Take for example, minimalism happening in Europe and the minimalism happening in South America in the 60's and 70's.  Also, are you looking at art simply in terms of visual arts? painting? and what time frame?    Overall though, remember to pick something you are actually interested in.  You'll be researching things to death, so you might as well like it.  As more questions if you need help."
ArtHistory,39yjbo,EJ_HA,2,Tue Jun 16 01:01:14 2015 UTC,"Well, my biggest fear is to have insufficient knowledge and information gathered in the given time to do this. It's not like I can dedicate 2 or three years exclusively to this research. This matter is something that keeps popping in my mind all the time, specially when I see someone using subjective arguments to define something as ugly.  What I'm trying to achieve is a way to analyze the creation of a concept of beauty. What aspects can influence the development of what is beautiful and what is not. So, basically I don't have a preference for any culture, since my objective does not require any specific culture. However, given the limitations of time and knowledge, it would be better, as you said, to focus on a single culture.   My biggest motivation is something that a teacher said to the class last year: Areas near the equatorial zone tend to have more colorful arts because of the sun incidence. He used the Brazilian northeast culture, compared to the south and southeast Brazilian culture (yes, I'm Brazilian). I don't mean to use it as a base argument to the research, but his statement used a geographical aspect to justify a characteristic present in the art of that area. This is what I'm looking for.  I don't know if I that is clear, but my main focus is to show those influences, that must be taken into consideration before analyzing an art from another culture.  And about the statement that you corrected, perhaps I shouldn't use such a broad and objective argument. I don't think that such aspects create an unique art style or concept, but that they can influence and shape them.  So to sum everything up, this is a raw idea, I don't have much details about it, and since it is too ambitious and I'm afraid of expecting more than what I actually can do, it could better to drop it and think of something else.  But assuming that I'm planning to do a research on how these aspects work by focusing on a specific culture,what art art movement or style do you think that was largely influenced by cultural, religious and (last but not least) geographical aspects?

The reason being that one should have access to see the art in real-life. 'To see once is to see nothing.' As far as your interest in geographical location, there is an artist local to me who stated she used more reds, oranges, a desert pallet when in Arizona and when she moved to our port city now uses more blues, greens, and more nautical pallet. Even in your own state there can be difference. When I lived in the mountain region of mine I used (or pulled in photography) more yellow and red variations because of the clay dirt. When I moved back to the oceanside blues returned. Sorry of this seems rambling. But the best advice I have received is read, go look at art, read more, look again and the thesis will come while you are working.

ArtHistory,39k74u,kinderdemon,5,Fri Jun 12 14:50:20 2015 UTC,"But Cezanne was always painting things, he said that it was okay to not focus on a literal representation, that even impressionists valued.

ArtHistory,39k74u,functor7,2,Fri Jun 12 16:31:00 2015 UTC,"Well, (not that it is a race to non-figurative abstraction or anything ;) but Kandinsky's categorization of his paintings into improvisations, impressions and compositions etc. indicated that often either music or other sensory experiences were being represented.   I meant more stuff like Apples and Biscuits. The horizon is tilted, the vantage point is purposefully broken, the space is flattened. Something incoherent is happening around the knife drawer and the titular biscuits are practically invisible. The apples are neither at eye level, nor below nor above.   The whole thing is about painting, it tilts like paintings tilt when you try to hang them, it exists explicitly in a weird canvas space, which is flat and square and not at all a window. A false space, where the important parts are clearly more real than the periphery, as lampshaded by the knife aimed at the fourth wall, which violently reconstitutes the normal (and normally invisible) axis of depth recession in traditional perspective.   Sure it is no Black Square, but it is just a one of many similar paintings for Cezanne, and yet it lampoons painting through painting, in a way Black Square and Ma Jolie only exagerrate.   It is a painting that is self-evidently a painting, but it breaks with all the rules of painting to be that way.   It gives up Renaissance perspective, which is already a huuuge break with Impressionism, post-impressionism and all other contemporaneous isms: only Manet screwed around with dropping Renaissance perspective immediately before Cezanne, and that was with his weird portraits like this one"
ArtHistory,39k74u,kinderdemon,2,Sat Jun 13 13:07:26 2015 UTC,"Kandinsky's categorization of his paintings into improvisations, impressions and compositions etc. indicated that often either music or other sensory experiences were being represented.    I had always heard this, and that he had synesthesia and that his paintings were trying to recreate these experiences and so were representing music. But after reading his book, it seems like this couldn't be more wrong.   Kandinsky was trying to communicate to the ""spirit"" in the purest way possible. He purposefully experimented with abstract forms, colors and compositions to try and understand how these affected the soul. He was inspired by music, not by trying to paint whatever synesthesia experiences he might have had, but because music was an art form that had already achieved much of what he was trying to do. Music is, by it's nature, nonrepresentative and so any emotional response coming from music was from the abstract musical shapes that they were making. Kandinsky saw this idea as something to strive for in painting, and saw himself as bringing the idealism he saw in music and literature into the form of color, composition and form in painting.  He was also inspired by abstract forms in literature as well. He has a book of poetry called ""Sounds"" and one thing that he likes to do is repeat a word in different rhythms and tones so that the word loses meaning and is just the sound that it makes. He told a correspondent to read his poetry as one would look at his paintings, by emptying the mind, not trying to find any representation and just let the painting, or poem, communicate directly with the soul.  I highly recommend reading his book, definitely and inspiration for me, and helps show his true intentions with his art, which are much bigger than ""Painting synesthesia experiences from a concert"".  While he was listing music and literature as things to aspire towards in painting, he mentioned painters who were going along these lines. Cezanne was one, and for the exact things you have been talking about. (He thought Picasso apathetic about color and that Matisse was bad with form, it's kinda funny to hear him talk about it). But Cezanne did not go a far as Kandinsky would have liked, into the pure nonrepresentational abstract."

I'm not sure Kandinsky succeeded in going towards totally nonrepresentational abstraction, and I don't think it is possible to paint ""pure spirit"" even if he claimed that he did.

His work had a transformative effect within ukiyo-e, pushing towards greater naturalism in actor portraits, as well as fueling the popularity of ""big head"" prints.   About thirty years later, Hokusai's work focused landscapes in no small part because of government bans on most portrait-type works.   Hokusai's landscapes in turn had a huge effect on ideas of flatness and space for the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, especially van Gogh.

ArtHistory,39k74u,mhfc,4,Sat Jun 13 00:28:26 2015 UTC,"Certainly! Harunobu's prints are absolutely beautiful, but his exact influence is a bit harder to pin down. Stylistically, his delicate, childish figure had a relatively short lifespan as the fashionable ""type"". Subject-wise, he popularized images of townspeople, particularly girls, that were neither courtesans nor actors. This became a massively popular genre that waxed and waned with various censorship laws.  All that being said, if you compare Harunobu stylistically to the artists who come immediately after him, such as Katsukawa Shunsho and  Kitao Shigemasa, there aren't too many carry-overs. Whereas, there are some pretty clear connections between Sharaku, Utamaro, and the later artists of the Utagawa School.   In terms of game-changing innovation, Harunobu is most strongly associated with the ""nishiki-e"" full color woodblock prints. For me, this accreditation feels a bit wobbly. Woodblock prints were designed by an artist, but produced by a team of carvers and printers, all under the direction of a publisher. While the innovation to produce the full color prints was, indeed, brilliant, I suspect it came from someone in the production line familiar with the techniques, rather than Harunobu himself.

ArtHistory,39k74u,greeneyeris,3,Fri Jun 12 12:25:50 2015 UTC,"Well Chardin should get some credit for opening those floodgates  long before Courbet. But Courbet was just so so outspoken about it.   Chardin made the genre painting into a respected genre within the French academy, borrowing from the Dutch masters, of course, and painted poor people with dignity, while Courbet straight-up made epic history paintings about the poor. Both are big paradigm shifts."

Also the Wiki article on the subject does not do it justice, so don't expect to find answers there.  Basically, connoisseurship is the process of identification (attribution) of art works on stylistic grounds. If that sounds like something up your alley, I recommend taking a look at Bendor Grosvenor's blog Art History News. Here's a great article to pique your interest: ""Why connoisseurship matters (ctd.)"".  If you are interested in it from a more theoretical viewpoint, I highly recommend reading Richard Neer's article ""Connoisseurship and the Stakes of Style"". I'm currently researching the topic of identification, and honestly, this is one of the best articles I have ever read on this topic, at least in the field of art history. It really strikes at the heart of the matter, i.e. how and why we identify things."

ArtHistory,38260o,RedPotato,2,Mon Jun 1 17:43:35 2015 UTC,"Rape of Europa - WW2 art documentary, very good, long though  Waste Land - Another good doc but doesn't get into the art aspect for the first half  F for Fake - Focuses on Elmyr, art forger and narrated by/starring Orson Welles  Art of the Steal - Controversy around the Barnes Collection and it's move into a new building  Radiant Child - Basquiat documentary with some of his close friends  Art & Craft - Art forger Mark Landis and his mental health issues"
ArtHistory,38260o,Maccai3,2,Mon Jun 1 18:23:55 2015 UTC,"Rape of Europa is excellent; Art and Craft on the other hand, could have been about half the time and been just as effective."
ArtHistory,38260o,gartkar,1 point,Mon Jun 1 20:24:04 2015 UTC,"i did enjoy Art & Craft but i agree it was padded out, Rape of Europa was a really good watch.  I also would recommend any series that Alastair Sooke does, most are available on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJFR9oSosCg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX-4UL_boY8  he did a series called Modern Masters also on youtube"
ArtHistory,38260o,fixmycupofcaffeine,2,Tue Jun 2 03:01:28 2015 UTC,"""Painters Painting"" is an excellent documentary. It's mostly interviews with various artists starting with the 1950s era AbEx painters. I think its still on YouTube."
ArtHistory,38260o,CrudeReform,2,Mon Jun 1 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"There's a whole subreddit for this! r/artdocumentaries  But personal recommendations are nice too, of course. I also really like Painters Painting that was already mentioned. In a kind of similar vein, Conceptual Paradise is excellent if Conceptual Art is something that interests you."

ArtHistory,381sqb,pocketsquare,6,Mon Jun 1 06:05:16 2015 UTC,"The J. Paul Getty Guide to Imagery series sounds like the kind of thing you're after - there are several books on religious subjects including saints, old testament imagery etc. They obviously are not massively in depth, but I like how they introduce a symbols or figure, and then show a variety of paintings with it in, also explaining how it works together with other symbols etc in each painting. I think looking specifically at religious symbolism books will be quicker & better than just reading The Lives of the Saints, because sometimes symbols related to a Saint come about from aspects outside of the official 'life'."

ArtHistory,37o7se,SmittyFjordmanjensen,1 point,Fri May 29 02:29:29 2015 UTC,"yes, this is pretty much as brainless as things regarded by someone as Art gets, at least on the surface. But an Artnet article about it said something that disturbed me:   This kind of sexism isn't okay   I would say as long as there are  people in our culture who think and act as depicted  in these pieces, it very much IS okay. Art is a reflection of society. The day we can't hold a mirror to our basest behavior is the day art suffers a terrible blow.  What he did is tasteless and immature. So are the people out there who say exactly these sorts of things to others on the internet.  Who can say what the ultimate value of this art is? The twitterverse is ablaze with related commentary. Isn't this (one of the many reasons) why we make art?"

ArtHistory,37o7se,KosherNazi,0,Sat Jun 27 05:43:23 2015 UTC,"Who's actually going to buy these? $90 is a lot less than $90k, but it's still more than these images are really worth. The people who bought the Prince originals (maybe I should have put that word in quotes?) were willing to pay so much because they thought it was good art. Why would anyone pay $90 just to make a point, especially since the people paying weren't the ones who felt personally injured by Prince."
ArtHistory,37o7se,KosherNazi,3,Fri May 29 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"Prince put them on large canvases, and it probably took more than $90 in materials alone to create his works. I've seen similar comments on Reddit with people saying ""just print out a copy"" and it's clear these people are not actually looking at the art they criticize. I too think it's shitty art, but I'm far more offended by ignorant hate.   You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.  That he spent ~$100 on canvas before inkjetting his screenshots on it doesn't really elevate his work beyond the ""just print out a copy"" criticism."
ArtHistory,37o7se,durutticolumn,3,Fri May 29 16:26:15 2015 UTC,The article I read said he literally used a low resolution inkjet printer.
ArtHistory,37o7se,durutticolumn,1 point,Fri May 29 16:37:29 2015 UTC,"I had read otherwise, but according to some Googling you're right. However I stand by the first part of my argument, which has nothing to do with the quality of the printing."
ArtHistory,37o7se,durutticolumn,3,Fri May 29 16:45:22 2015 UTC,Do you really think people bought them because they thought it was good art? I don't think so. Now did they pay so much because of the status of owning one of the infamous $90k Richard Prince prints? Probably.
ArtHistory,37o7se,Galious,1 point,Fri May 29 17:13:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think people don't buy art unless they think it's good. They might not like the art themselves, but they believe someone else will think it's good. Nobody buys art if they genuinely believe it to be shit. There's no ""status"" to owning bad art."
ArtHistory,37o7se,i_paint_things,2,Fri May 29 17:21:50 2015 UTC,That's a fair argument. We'll just have to wait and see what these things turn around at auction in the future. Art is a very tricky investment.
ArtHistory,37o7se,Galious,1 point,Fri May 29 19:22:09 2015 UTC,"Definitely, and I would not expect these to do very well. IMO the people who think it's good art are wrong and therefore made a shitty investment. Then again, they're now some of the most famous artworks of the 21st century so maybe they will do well."
ArtHistory,37o7se,Galious,9,Fri May 29 20:05:19 2015 UTC,"Why mad? they are re-appropriating appropriation art. It's like a clever meta artistic statement. Now we just wait for Richard Prince to buy a $90 copy of his $90,000 copy and put it in a gallery where rich people will buy the copy of the copy of the copy  *edit: forget a 'copy' in copy of a copy of a copy.  #justappropriationartthings"

ArtHistory,37o7se,SamisSimas,1 point,Fri May 29 08:23:25 2015 UTC,I must say that I really don't get the artistic value of all this appropriation art but on a purely philosophical level it's quite interesting
ArtHistory,37o7se,SamisSimas,2,Fri May 29 11:31:43 2015 UTC,I really hope that happens. I haven't heard of any responses from Prince. (He's probably busy swimming in a pool of 1 dollar bills.) The Suicide Girls have really put forward a clever next logical step in the discourse Prince started. I hope we get a public response from him.
ArtHistory,37o7se,SamisSimas,1 point,Fri May 29 17:02:40 2015 UTC,"I read an interview of Prince where he told the story that one day he saw a reproduction of his nuns series in a market. He said that since he had stolen it in the first place, he could say nothing against it and simply bought a copy."
ArtHistory,37nf5x,nojuan_1,3,Thu May 28 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"Can corroborate the first half.  If you look at early Greek and Myceneaen sculpture you see stiff figures and sometimes exagerated features, especially in the Mycenean.  Also, you can compare to Bronze Age Minoan art, another Aegean civilization.  As the years go on, an emphasis starts to emerge on naturalism and grace in the figures.  We start to see the contrapposto stance and more identifiable subject matter.  Classical sculpture would also focus on the ideal.  Classic sculptures such as the Spear Bearer and the Disc Thrower are good examples of this, though the disc thrower is a bit more contorted than a natural body could be to throw.  From there you move into the Hellenistic period, which in my opinion reflects similar ideals as the Baroque period, dealing with dramatic poses and subject matter.  The Romans made copies of these statues as they found them but I really can't speak to the decline of their artwork.  I may come back with an edit and put some hyperlink pics in.  Edit: added in a few pictures.  Hope this helps your project though some of the statues are nsf school depending on the age group. I mean, I think their all safe for school at any age but I'm me."
ArtHistory,37nf5x,themightykobold,2,Fri May 29 03:34:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying.  Among other things, I teach music theory, and I'm trying to gather images to show what can happen to art when priorities in society change.  I think this may be easier to illustrate in art than in music, as most young people think modern pop music sounds just fine!"
ArtHistory,37nf5x,clover3k,2,Fri May 29 13:44:05 2015 UTC,"This would be an awesome period to use as an example. This period begins to focus on Christianity after it's been legalized, and you can really see the difference in art- like dramatically. As Rome's economy fell, people looked towards an afterlife (the quality of their current lives were very poor). Christianity offered that to people, along with repentance and promise of heaven.   Anyway in art, their priorities shifted from portraying idealistic/naturalistic subjects/people in realistic situations , to abstraction. Their concern with the physical shifted to concern with the metaphysical. Visual/perceptual art shifted to symbolism/conceptual art. Their idea of artistic beauty changes from proportion and grace to spiritualism/symbolism.   The people began to have a negative view of the body, hence the changes. They believed reality exists with God, and that they were stuck in a disillusioned dimension. Their soul was stuck in their body but really wants to go home to God.   This would be early Byzantine- Emperor Justinian   http://i.imgur.com/R7gHiYH.jpg"
ArtHistory,37nf5x,clover3k,2,Fri May 29 21:32:04 2015 UTC,The sculpture: Tetrarchs is another good example of childlike sculptures. Details are muddled but the symbolism is what is important.   http://i.imgur.com/hrexwm8.jpg
ArtHistory,37nf5x,clover3k,2,Fri May 29 21:34:30 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  But in this case it sounds like society was intentionally moving towards abstraction.  What I am ideally looking for is an example where society didn't realize that their sculpture (or any other kind of art) was changing - as if they had ""lost"" the ability, even though there were still the same number of talented people being born.  They were still trying to portray subjects as naturalistic, but just couldn't.    Does that make sense?  I'm trying to link visual art to a discussion on why we study music, as opposed to just listen to it.  There's a big difference, but it's not something many people think about.   Thank you for your input!"
ArtHistory,37nf5x,themightykobold,2,Sat May 30 00:34:20 2015 UTC,"I can't say for sure if it was intentional or not- but it's a hard judgement for any circumstance, including music IMO, but I'm not educated in music so obviously I don't know. Just pointing out that intentional could possibly be subjective. Good luck with your project of sorts!"
ArtHistory,37nf5x,autowikibot,2,Sat May 30 00:51:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  And I'm trying to show, in the broadest of strokes possible, what can happen.  You guys have been a great help!"

Now, from my very limited understanding of the subject, I've always thought that ""classical"" Greece and ""hellenistic"" Greece were the same era.  Can you give me some super rough dates to delineate the obviously different styles of sculpture that you have linked to?"

ArtHistory,37dl31,jmk816,5,Fri May 29 17:21:46 2015 UTC,"Can we all just remember that the $90K being spent on these is just for the name Richard Prince. I have not read any artist statements on this collection and would be interested in seeing how and why he's chosen to do this collection. If there is no artistic thought behind these other than the pictures all seemed to have a vast amount of ""likes"" on them, I see no point in displaying them at all. If this was used as a way to inform the public about the scary truth of ownership rights once on social media sites and all the money was donated to some sort of charity or whatnot, I'd be a little more okay with this. But because it seems like a blatant attempt to make profit without any type of thought, then that's when I shake my head and fear for the future of what can be considered ""fine art""."
ArtHistory,37dl31,toadnovak,2,Wed May 27 15:48:21 2015 UTC,There are vast vast catalogs of academic writing about Richard Prince. He has been being written about by art historians since the 80's. Why does an art history sub seem to not know who this man is? Is everyone here pre-1950 or something.
ArtHistory,37dl31,thesmallestpizza,1 point,Fri May 29 22:29:49 2015 UTC,I wish we were all pre-1950s. I was talking to a prof of mine about Prince and he said he hadn't really heard too much about Prince up until the Instagram stuff.   But I was more interested in finding the statement about the Instagram installation. But than again I also really haven't searched for it.
ArtHistory,37dl31,durutticolumn,1 point,Fri May 29 23:42:47 2015 UTC,"It seems like all of the art subs even this one and /r/museum seem to be elated with everything pre-abstract expressionism while shunning most contemporary fine art, especially conceptual art."

Generally my opinion changes or I at least have a grudging respect.  Yet I find it impossible to see any value in Richard Prince's work. I like conceptual and appropriation art, so I don't think that's the issue. He just doesn't seem to do anything visually or intellectually interesting with the images he appropriates. I've asked people what I'm missing and never heard anyone defend him.  So what's the deal with Prince? The only answer I can come up with is he seemed initially interesting in the 80s and could have been promising, so he got super famous but then didn't live up to his potential. But then why are people still paying $90k for his new works?"
ArtHistory,37dl31,durutticolumn,5,Wed May 27 01:35:51 2015 UTC,"It could be money laundering or some other similar sort of financial maneuvering. I'm not saying it is the case here, but you have to consider that the value of art is mostly artificial."
ArtHistory,37dl31,ferretmonkey,4,Wed May 27 13:42:20 2015 UTC,"""Value"" is an artificial concept. The laws of supply and demand are not exclusive to art.  I think what you mean is that the art market is mostly speculative. People often buy works based on what they think the resale value will be. Like in any speculative market, they usually make the wrong bet as only a select few get to be resold for millions."
ArtHistory,37dl31,durutticolumn,2,Wed May 27 19:48:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the point is that you're trying to make.  But no, that’s not what I mean. I’m not disagreeing with what you’re saying, and the reasoning behind Princes’ work selling for $90,000 can be as simple as your description. However, the point you made is a given within the point I’m trying to actually make, which is that the art market is at times seedy. Prices are inflated through shady means (for example, you have collectors selling and buying back their work over periods of years to increase its dollar value at a future auction).  But what I’m really trying to say is that given that the dollar worth attributed to a work of art does not equate necessarily to the sum of its parts, I can theoretically sell you a kilo of cocaine and you can buy some canvas I printed on for whatever the artificially constructed  value associated with a kilo of cocaine is.   Or it could be just as simple as ways to maneuver around having to pay taxes. Here is one article on this subject, and here is another."
ArtHistory,37dl31,thejustducky1,2,Wed May 27 21:32:54 2015 UTC,"Everything you just described is typical of a speculative market. I'm not saying such markets are pretty, but they're pretty common and hardly exclusive to art. If people really want to launder money, there are plenty of better places to do it than the risky art market. Yes some people do, but they lose more often than they win.  And you seem to be stuck on this idea of absolute value. Yes the price for a kilo of cocaine is easier to predict than the price for a particular painted canvas. But again, all value is artificial. Cocaine and art are both worth what people are willing to pay for them. And of course art is worth more than the sum of its parts - so are computers, and cars, and pretty much everything you buy (as a raw good purchased by consumers, cocaine is a a rare exception)."

ArtHistory,37cdga,Boo_tang,4,Tue May 26 16:21:50 2015 UTC,"I had a course on art based French in my first year of art history - it was basically intermediate level French with an emphasis on art terms. So if I were you I would brush up on art terms - techniques, mediums, art-related adjectives - and then also have a look at some recently published articles in French, see what kind of level they are at and practice translating them. Keep doing duo lingo but they focus on a grounding in reading, writing and listening, whereas by the sound of it you just need reading, so I wouldn't make that your main focus! Good luck :)"
ArtHistory,37cdga,GoldenAgeGirl,6,Tue May 26 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"The best resource for learning how to read French to pass a graduate translation exam is undoubtedly French For Reading. It's really great no matter what level you're entering at, because it focuses on the grammatical structures, and gives you actual academic passages to translate. Helped me prepare for my French exam more than anything else! It's a little weirdly expensive for a book, but I think it's really the only thing that you need to teach yourself to read.   If you're learning from the ground up (which it sounds like you are) and you want to invest in a program, I recommend Fluenz over Rosetta Stone for reading. It's pretty expensive (close to $400) but it's really well structured to teach and explain how and why particular grammar rules work in the ways that they do, rather than to teach through immersion and repetition. (I got it in addition to the French For Reading book, but honestly found French For Reading to be more useful, but it kind of depends on what kind of a learner you are).   After I passed my exam, I spoke with the professor who graded it about a couple places in the passage that I found to be difficult, and she recommended that it's a good idea to invest in a French to French dictionary as well as a French to English one. That way, if your French to English dictionary gives you a definition for a word that doesn't quite fit in the context of the passage, you can see if it maybe has another meaning. I only brought one dictionary to my exam, though a couple of my colleagues who took it with me had literally 10 (which is a bit excessive), but it could potentially pay off to have at least a couple.   One of the most important things for me in taking the translation exam was to be able to recognize all of the different verb tenses and formations, so if there's one thing to really focus on, it's that."
ArtHistory,37cdga,fixmycupofcaffeine,1 point,Tue May 26 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"You should talk to your Director of Graduate Studies (or equivalent professor who is the liaison with grad students), as well as any current students with whom you might have contact.  Then, you can learn how your department does it. In mine we get funding for one summer of language study (usually an immersion program either in-country or at Middlebury) and are expected to do our second before arriving or on our own time. If you only need French, look into summer French programs before you start, or perhaps there is one at your university you can take for non- or partial credit during the year or next summer."
ArtHistory,37cdga,pipkin42,1 point,Wed May 27 01:22:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with GoldenAgeGirl. I have just completed my Master's in Art History. Even though I had taken French since I was very young, what they expected were the art terms. I had a very difficult time with the test due to this and needed the help of the dictionary very much so. There are numerous colloquialisms and the way the sentences are phrased often are not complete sentences if you attempt to translate them literally. I would recommend going to the websites of Musee D'Orsay, the Louvre, and/or Montreal's Museum of Contemporary Art.

But, I think the larger issue here is the fact that Barnes owned this artwork, and his will had very specific outlines for how he wanted his collection to be treated, preserved, displayed, conceptualized, etc. And it's not as though Philadelphia is lacking on the Fine Art front. There's the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Rodin Museum, the museum at the Philadelphia Institute of Fine Art ... this was a very special kind of collection meant to be teaching-based.   It's sort of the same argument for why re-patriation is important - if a piece of art (even one as important, stunning and famous as a Klimt) was stolen by the Nazis but rightfully belongs to a Jewish family (I'm talking about The Gold Portrait here), it's important that the Jewish family is at least consulted before keeping the piece in a public collection. There are many right ways to go about public art collecting and wrong ways to go about public art collecting, especially as a reputable museum, and going directly against a collector's will and testament is the wrong way. As was the case with the City of Philadelphia, the PMA, and the other nonprofits/institutions that went against Barnes' will to create the Barnes Foundation as it is today in Center City."

It could work contrary to your argument as well.   And this would have ramifications that would go way beyond just artwork. You could argue that money is far better off being distributed to the community than being kept in multi-million-dollar trust funds - thus, people could no longer distribute their money as they wish.   I'm honestly just trying to be the devil's advocate here, but what's really at stake is the reality that the City of Philadelphia went against a binding legal document. That's it.

ArtHistory,374m8q,LovelyFugly,8,Sun May 24 20:53:03 2015 UTC,"Did they not like the modern experimentation?   They didn't like (or at least wanted to break from) the art that we would today recognize as more modern. I'm thinking specifically of the Romantic painting style that had dominated England for almost a century (the Pre-Raphaelites predate Impressionism, the generally accepted beginning of ""Modern Art"", by 20 years) as exemplified by Turner or Reynolds. We might see these artists are precursors to a 20th century expressionist or abstract style, but by the mid 19th Century they felt outdated. This is my roundabout way of saying: it would be (at least partially) wrong to see the PRB as anti-modern.  As for your main question, I've always found it strange they chose to single out Raphael. The reason generally given is because the early 16th century Italian High Renaissance marked a move from the ""brighter"" painting style of the late Medieval and early Renaissance. Indeed this is somewhat true, as you can see an earlier painter like Masaccio shows almost no shadows and the most famous Renaissance invention was chiaroscuro (a method of shading). However Raphael is hardly the man to hold responsible for this shift, though he did employ the style.  In fact even the Pre-Raphaelites didn't hate Raphael. I can't find a citation right now but I know I've read about them praising some of his paintings for their bright coloration. I think the real reason they chose his name is he had traditionally been seen as the highest achievement of the Renaissance (until relatively recently he was seen as a more important artist than Michelangelo) so he was the perfect target for iconoclasts.  Important to note the PRB didn't (to my knowledge) advocate returning to the Medieval Gothic style; their interest seems to have been more in the precursors to the Renaissance. I interpret this to mean they thought the Renaissance was a good thing, it just took a wrong turn. So they wanted to continue making progress in art, they just wanted to take the past as their starting point."
ArtHistory,374m8q,durutticolumn,2,Sun May 24 21:25:08 2015 UTC,"What's the Medieval Gothic style? Gothic is a term coined to describe certain parts of Romanticism, right?"
ArtHistory,374m8q,imd,2,Mon May 25 03:55:12 2015 UTC,"The International Gothic Style was the dominant style in art and architecture during the late Medieval period (maybe 12th-14th centuries). I'm far from an expert so I don't know exactly what distinguishes the style, but basically all the famous cathedrals are Gothic.  One of the big themes of Romanticism in the early 19th century was returning to (an idealized version of) Medieval culture. A lot of artists adopted (psuedo)Medieval forms - for instance Wordsworth and Coleridge's first book of poems was called Lyrical Ballads, and ballads were the trade of Medieval troubadours.  Therefore it was natural for the Gothic style to come back into fashion, since it defined the height of Medieval culture. During the 19th century a lot of Gothic Revival architecture was built; for instance the UK Houses of Parliament were built around 1850, but their style is indebted to Medieval cathedrals.  However during the Romantic era Gothic did take on a new meaning, as it became associated with a particular kind of literature; Edgar Allen Poe's stories are the most famous example. It got the name Gothic literature because it was often set in Medieval castles and is indebted to fairy tales, but today we remember it as ""spooky"" and that's where the modern use of the word Gothic comes from."
ArtHistory,374m8q,durutticolumn,2,Mon May 25 05:58:01 2015 UTC,"I was confused, thinking that Gothic fiction was where the adjective came from."
ArtHistory,374m8q,imd,1 point,Mon May 25 13:59:33 2015 UTC,"So Gothic period is roughly mid XII to XV century. Those were still times of quite heavly religious culture. Artists were just craftsmen. Gothic architecture is very characterictic - huge cathedrals, big focus on verticalism of the structures. They found out that if you use a pointed arch you can make it really high, without also making it wide. All the great French cathedrals (like Notre-Dame in Paris) are gothic. In Italy for example, that style didn't really catch on and building from these times in Italy are still quite horizontal and not tall.  Gothic painting is entirely religious. It seems flat, because no perspective is used, and the form is not shaded much, with a flat coloring. This is slowly gonna chamge with the transition to renesanse."
ArtHistory,374m8q,TheTurnipKnight,2,Mon May 25 07:39:01 2015 UTC,Thanks so much. This clarified some things for me. And they didn't hate Raph! All the better.
ArtHistory,374m8q,Quietuus,8,Mon May 25 06:15:27 2015 UTC,"As /u/durutticolumn points out, the PRB didn't hate on Raphael; they hated on the imitators of Raphael, and of other artists of the high renaissance. The PRB compiled in 1848 a 'List of Immortals' that includes Raphael, Leonardo, Titian and Tintorello.  To understand what the pre-Raphaelites were doing, it's instructive to look at the early criticism they received, particularly some of the stuff written around Millais' Christ in the House of His Parents and Holman-Hunt's The Hireling Shepherd. This will key you in to what distinguished the PRBs in the eyes of contemporary critics. Charles Dickens reaction in Household Words ('Old Lamps for New Ones', 1850) to Millais' work is often quoted. Here is a section:   You behold the interior of a carpenter’s shop. In the foreground of that carpenter’s shop is a hideous, wry-necked, blubbering, red-headed boy, in a bed-gown, who appears to have received a poke in the hand, from the stick of another boy with whom he has been playing in an adjacent gutter, and to be holding it up for the contemplation of a kneeling woman, so horrible in her ugliness, that (supposing it were possible for any human creature to exist for a moment with that dislocated throat) she would stand out from the rest of the company as a Monster, in the vilest cabaret in France, or the lowest ginshop in England. Two almost naked carpenters, master and journeyman, worthy companions of this agreeable female, are working at their trade; a boy, with some small flavor of humanity in him, is entering with a vessel of water; and nobody is paying any attention to a snuffy old woman who seems to have mistaken that shop for the tobacconist’s next door, and to be hopelessly waiting at the counter to be served with half an ounce of her favourite mixture. Wherever it is possible to express ugliness of feature, limb, or attitude, you have it expressed. Such men as the carpenters might be undressed in any hospital where dirty drunkards, in a high state of varicose veins, are received. Their very toes have walked out of Saint Giles’s.   You can read the whole thing here. Now, with that paragraph in mind, take a look at the painting. I would wager that most contemporary viewers would have a great deal of difficulty seeing in this painting the extraordinary, blasphemous ugliness that Dickens (and others) saw.   To understand the shock of the Pre-Raphaelites, it's important to understand the narrative of art history that had been dominant in Western high culture since the Renaissance, which had scarce deviated at its core from the ideas laid out in Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects in 1550. In this view, everything that had occurred artistically between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance was viewed, essentially, as a wasteland. This was closely linked in to the role that the philosophic concept of neo-platonic Idealism had played in almost all high art since this time.  The basic concept of Idealism in art is probably best laid out by Giovanni Bellori in his Lives of the Modern Painters Sculptors and Architects, a conscious sequel to Vasari's work:   When that high and eternal intellect, the creator of nature, made his marvellous works by reflecting deeply within himself, he established the first forms called Ideas. Each species was derived from that first Idea, and so was formed the admirable web of created things. The celestial bodies above the moon, not being subject to change, remained forever beautiful and in harmony; and because of their measured spheres and because of the splendour of their appearance we recognise them to be in all eternity of the highest perfection and beauty. On the other hand, sublunar bodies are subject to change and to ugliness and, although nature always means to produce excellence in its workings, nevertheless forms are altered through the inequality of matter, and human beauty in particular is muddled, as we see from the countless deformities and disproportions that are in us.  For this reason the noble painters and sculptors imitate that first creator, and form in their minds also an example of superior beauty and, reflecting on it, improve upon nature until it is without fault of colour or line...  ...Now, to join the precepts of the ancient philosophers to the best maxims of our modern ones, Leon Battista Alberti teaches that in all things one should love not only the appearance, but principally the beauty, and that one ought to select the most praised parts from the most beautiful bodies...Raphael of Urbino, the great master of those who know, thus writes to Castiglione of his Galatea: 'In order to paint a beautiful woman, it would be necessary for me to see many beautiful women, but since there is a scarcity of them, I make use of a certain Idea which comes to my mind.'   Now, this concept of idealism, the idea that the goal of art was to create things that surpassed the world's beauty, didn't pass down through the ages completely unaltered, and it wasn't always observed. There are places and periods were it fell out of fashion completely (the Dutch Golden Age is a good example). However, it cast a long shadow, particularly in art with religious or mythological themes (the highest sort of work, according to the heirarchy of genres).   The PRB didn't exactly reject idealism; in fact, I suspect they may have believed they were invigorating the practice by exercising a degree of fidelity to nature that hadn't really been approached since the Northern Renaissance (Van Eyck, Durer, Van der Wyden etc.). Their way of seeing was strongly influenced by the current passion for science, and they were in many ways reacting to an intellectual revolution that was rendering talk of 'imperfect sublunar bodies' untenable. Their writings seem to indicate more that they thought the spirit of the renaissance had become corrupt; they reserved a special ire for works in the 'rubenist' tradition that claimed to reject 'poussinist' idealism. In a sense, the Pre-Raphaelites were poussinists, but a comparison of, say, Poussin's Et In Arcadia Ego with The Hireling Shepherd (something I have in part attempted here) shows the extent to which they transcended the distinction utterly in their greatest works. Pre-Raphaelite works (at least early ones) depict real people, with their imperfections. They depict them in places that, if not real, are incredibly realistic. A botanist could probably identify every single plant in Millais' Ophelia. But, crucially, they also rejected the almost automatic assumption that work that did not fit into a 'classical' tradition was inferior. 'true' Pre-Raphaelite works, at least (early pieces before 1870 particularly), feature a distinct lack of doric columns, togas, gorgons and so on. Personally, I consider them among the first 'modern' artists."
ArtHistory,374m8q,Quietuus,2,Mon May 25 05:34:22 2015 UTC,"I greatly appreciate your reply.   I'm trying to parse this in such a way that my simple brain will grasp. I might have more questions later when some of this can sink in.  I'd read Dickens' review at some point earlier and you're right that I pretty much wondered if the two of us divided by an ocean and a century could possibly be looking at the same image. (And in some sense we aren't because context and culture and blah blah.)  If I'm reading it right, and simplifying it to a massive degree, Dickens didn't like the work because it was too realistic? Rather, it didn't show an idealized version of people? Like he really lays into Mary and her ugliness, but all I see is a normal looking human.   I guess what I'm getting at is what is an example of a work or style that he'd being comparing that painting to? Hmm. The words. They will be clumsy as I try to find the right question.  A) Was it that so many religious paintings were done with that ""idealism"" in mind? And so this one in an ""uglier"" style stood out even more? B) Was it that the contemporary paintings at that time were so different from the PRB's?  And, further if it was that the contemporary paintings at that time were so different, what was being promoted/commissioned/praised/lauded, etc? (I realize that's probably a little more complicated because there can be a number of different things popular at once.) Maybe I'm hoping for an example.   Either way, again thank you for your extensive answer.  Edit: I just got through your comparison post that you'd noted about The Hireling Shepard and it makes me stupidly excited and I think helps put some more things into perspective! Now I just want to go stare at Pre-Raphaelite paintings for a while again."
ArtHistory,374m8q,Quietuus,3,Mon May 25 06:29:44 2015 UTC,"I guess what I'm getting at is what is an example of a work or style that he'd being comparing that painting to?   Reynold's The Holy Family With the Infant St. John, which I mentioned in that redditdayof post, is perhaps is worth looking at again. Reynolds was the grandfather of the Royal Academy. To put it more contemporary. This print of The Child Jesus by Collinson is exactly contemporaneous with Millais' work. Also, Dickens provides a fairly solid run-down of bourgeoise mid-Victorian British taste in his Household Words essay. The fact that Turner could rank the frankly ghastly Sir Edwin Landseer (an arch-sentimentalist who specialised in animals, and also Queen Victoria's favourite painter) along with near-forgotten twee merchants like Charles Leslie and put them both alongside JMW Turner himself shows the kind of confusion of sensibilities which the PRB railed against. Generally, the early Victorians would apply the legacy of idealism like vaseline on a camera lens; see for instance William Collins' Barmouth Sands. Even works which were supposed to be gritty genre pieces often have the picturesque, post-card quality to them.   It can all be quite difficult to see because, honestly, the figures in Christ in the House of His Parents are still very beautiful to my eye. The contemporary reaction speaks for itself though. Another point to recall (which I don't think Dickens brings up directly, though he alludes to it) is that to many contemporaries one of the really shocking things was that the Holy Family looked, to their eyes, uncomfortably Jewish."

Are you using the ""horrid"" definition? Or just the ""pallid"" one? If it's the ""horrid"" leaning ghastly can I ask for an expansion on that? What I see when looking at the linked image is serene, pretty and kinda soft. Maybe not anything that gets me thrilled, but I didn't see anything bad (granted art somewhat subjective).   ...the Holy Family looked, to their eyes, uncomfortably Jewish.

Instead of saying ""this is the argument that I want to make"" and then finding literature that supports what you're trying to say, read all of the key texts first, and then decide where the gaps are, and what they're not saying that you can say.   Do you have an advisor overseeing your thesis-writing endeavor? If so, meet with them with a prepared list of topics, and see which ones they think are most and least viable and why."

Pick a single interesting event, and then look at how it's been represented by different people or groups, or by the same group across different time periods. For example, I'd gotten interested in the Dutch Anabaptists at one point in my studies, so I chose a specific event - the Amsterdam Uprising - researched how that event was depicted both by the Catholic majority in artwork and by the Anabaptists themselves in literature, then connected the two. Boom, instant essay. Play ""Mad Libs"" with journal article titles. Can you find an interesting question and direct it at a different target? Or an interesting subject with a different question attached? Historians have asked and attempted to answer 20,000 different questions about the work of Alfred Hitchcock - but are all of those takes and viewpoints also there for the works of, say, Niccola Ricciolini? Probably not. Then there's a gap! The trick is finding a question that a few people have asked, but not many, then synthesising their work (and borrowing some of their sources) before coming up with your own take on the matter. Pick two artworks from entirely separate genres and periods, and brainstorm as many connections as you can think of between them - don't filter for ""interesting"", just free associate. After five minutes (by the clock), look what you've come up with and see if there are any connections that might be interesting to expand outwards. Find other works that fit the pattern - especially ones close to one of the two already chosen works, come up with some ideas of why that pattern might be there, etc. This is how I ended up picking a topic for my Master's thesis - a painting of Queen Victoria and a photograph I'd taken of some effigies in a chapel in Warwick led me down a garden path that ended with a 20,000 word thesis on the ridiculously specialised subject of ""Gender representation in tomb monuments of Early Modern England"".   In the end, the empty page is the most intimidating. Just write something, and it'll flow easier from there."

Above them? Below them? In front on the table or at its edge?    Cezanne bends the space of painting, the same sort of breaks and ruptures that Picasso does, only Cezanne does it first and much more subtly.   Picasso exagerrates what Cezanne invented to shape the cubist approach."

It is kind of dated, but I still find it a great learning tool, showing you how the many -isms existed side by side and influenced one another. Cézanne is there the first figure at the most top, influencing both Fauvism and Cubism, the two most important avantgarde movements of the early 1900s. As a closer look on his life and work, the World Gallery of Art is a good source of basic information and reproductions. If you are looking for a more detailed and deeper analysis, there is a great deal of publications on Cézanne, but I would suggest Paul Cézanne by Meyer Schapiro, one of the greatest art historians of the 20th century."

Its notion of ""influence"" depends completely on ""shit Barr liked better than other shit"""

Sure, the arrows of influence might be off, but the dating and the names stay I guess. You seem to have strong opinions about the subject. Is the diagram really so useless by today's standards? I mean, it is part of the art history itself, but I think it might still have some informational value regarding the development of art in the first half of the 20th century."
ArtHistory,37293s,Byakushi,1 point,Sun May 24 13:00:57 2015 UTC,"No, the dating and names are exactly what's wrong with it. It tries (as was typical for its time) to discretely identify lines of influence and periods and names, which just doesn't hold up to what we know today of how movements and ideas emerged, circulated, and interacted back then. Plus, the ""influences"" the diagram represents are very much indebted to a gaze emanating from Western connoisseurship, and neglects transnational exchanges.

But at no point do they endow the members of the lower classes with agency or independence from their bourgeoisie needs. You have to wait for Van Gogh for that.  Cezanne was the richest of them, taking a year and more to paint a sketchy image. But his wealth gave him cache among his fellow bourgeois. They were all members of a class that recognized wealth as the only measure of value. He was the richest, therefore the most valuable."

ArtHistory,37293s,eggson,1 point,Sun May 24 13:48:41 2015 UTC,"Art and the French Commune by Albert Boime    In this bold exploration of the political forces that shaped Impressionism, Albert Boime proposes that at the heart of the modern is a ""guilty secret""--the need of the dominant, mainly bourgeois, classes in Paris to expunge from historical memory the haunting nightmare of the Commune and its socialist ideology. The Commune of 1871 emerged after the Prussian war when the Paris militia chased the central government to Versailles, enabling the working class and its allies to seize control of the capital. Eventually violence engulfed the city as traditional liberals and moderates joined forces with reactionaries to restore Paris to ""order""--the bourgeois order. Here Boime examines the rise of Impressionism in relation to the efforts of the reinstated conservative government to ""rebuild"" Paris, to return it to its Haussmannian appearance and erase all reminders of socialist threat.  Boime contends that an organized Impressionist movement owed its initiating impulse to its complicity with the state's program. The exuberant street scenes, spaces of leisure and entertainment, sunlit parks and gardens, the entire concourse of movement as filtered through an atmosphere of scintillating light and color all constitute an effort to reclaim Paris visually and symbolically for the bourgeoisie. Amply documented, richly illustrated, and compellingly argued, Boime's thesis serves as a challenge to all cultural historians interested in the rise of modernism.   Here's a video about it: http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HYHfDN81uvw#t=7m08s (Gets relevant about 7 minutes in.)"
ArtHistory,37293s,alllie,-7,Mon May 25 00:11:42 2015 UTC,"To begin with, modernism is a vast and often misused term. In painting cezanne and later the fauvists used big areas of colour, free flowing brush strokes, simplification of motifs and some abstraction.  Van Gogh is probably more important as a pioneer in this area in my opinion.   Modernism as a term when used in visual art makes little sense. There is expressionism, abstract art, cubism, suprematism and surrealism. Modernism is properly used in the context of architecture. It was a social movement to improve the living standards of ordinary people and started in the 1910s and lasted till 1933.   And sorry I cannot say anything about Picasso, I think he is an overrated camera hogger."

ArtHistory,370jzt,acciomoony,2,Sat May 23 21:31:55 2015 UTC,"Hello! Art History and Education student here. There are lots of resources for developing arts curricula out there! This was the first hit I got on google and it looks really neat, from looking it over pretty quickly. That said, I would think that a good approach to teaching art and art history is to use an inquiry-based framework, developed by educational theoreticians such as Dewey. I would recommend that you plan lessons out (there are lots of lesson plan models available online as well) in a way that leaves room for exploring what kids are most interested in about a certain topic.   In terms of what to teach, I think that understanding how to think about art objects analytically is where you should start. This looks like a good site explaining the basics of close visual analysis, although I'm sure you're familiar with what this consists in from having taken an Art History class yourself. You could ask them to look closely at selected paintings with you for the first lesson. Pick some paintings that you like and that are interesting to you, and try to get the kids to think in terms of these formal elements with you. Class discussion about this is always super fun, imo. You can always start them off with a simple thesis about a painting, for example, you might say that The Oath of the Horatii uses lots of straight, strong lines to draw attention to the central action of the painting, or you could compare and contrast the straight linearity of the male figures with that of the more curvilinear female figures. This is very basic, but I think it's something that 7-12 year olds can handle.   You could also talk about how the history of Western art is often conceptualized in terms of temporally discrete movements and groups of people with aesthetic affinities due to environmental and historical factors - movements can be large and encompass groups with more specific goals/ideas (for example, the relationship of Der Blaue Reiter to Expressionism as a larger movement). You could also touch on the idea of the cult of the artist (if you want, I can PM you a reading that I did for an introductory ArtH course that talked about this, the book is Legends, Myth, and Magic in the Image of the Artist by Kris & Kurz, trans. 1981 - which is a great read in any case). Art from other geographical contexts is thought about in this way as well, but I think there's a certain element of otherness that keeps it from being so established. You can talk about that as well - you might take a class on Asian Art, which is a much more generalized category than a class on Modern or Contemporary art.   Once you've established how people think about art objects and art movements, I think you can move on to specific time periods and places. It's up to you, I guess, to decide what you find most interesting. You could do a quick survey of Western art by focusing on select masterpieces from each period (which is SO difficult, but your time is limited). You can also look at different locations each week - you might do a week on Italy (and talk about the Roman and Greek periods, the Italian Renaissance, and Italian Futurism, for instance), and a week on China (Which I unfortunately don't know as much about, but you could talk about ceramics in different dynastic periods, touch upon contemporary art in China - I know there's lots of cool work in glass - and generally use what you learned in your Asian Art class).   There are lots of cool activities that you could do with kids. A final project could consist of kids doing something similar to this cute t-shirt, where you explore basic visual elements of specific movements. For the overachievers, you could have them write a short visual analysis essay (structure should be introduce the painting and its contents - i.e ""This painting by Jacques-Louis David (1784, oil on canvas), depicts x and y"" -, make an argument about it grounded on visual evidence, and present the evidence in body paragraphs).   Sorry for the long post, but I hope this helps you out. If you want more ideas for activities or would like me to point you to more resources, PM me!"
ArtHistory,370jzt,andreabuckland,2,Sun May 24 02:11:57 2015 UTC,"A few years ago I gave a workshop about religious symbols for kids. The idea was to design new altar clothes for church. My focus of the workshop was on letting the kids experience basic forms physically. How does 'vertical' feel, how does 'horizontal' feel? Some forms could only be experienced as a group. Then we tried to put this on paper with charcoal. I wanted them to concentrate on the body movement rather than the drawing. They all learned how to draw a perfect circle this way. We had sessions about colors, numbers and geometrical forms. I think the kids had a lot of fun and learned a lot about (religious) art at the same time. Some of this might work with your group of kids as well."

ArtHistory,36ud7d,WhatWouldIHavetoDo,3,Fri May 22 04:52:05 2015 UTC,"The Mona Lisa is a classic case of how context gives an artwork value and meaning. IMO it is neither Leonardo's most interesting nor most complex picture. Its fame is due almost entirely to its history as an object, and particularly its history in the last hundred and fifty years. It was in the French royal collection since the 16th century, but not particularly outstanding relative to other works by canonical artists in that collection. Its fame began to skyrocket from around the middle of the 19th century when Théophile Gautier, some Romantic poets, and Walter Pater wrote influential texts about it. Sigmund Freud's essay on Leonardo (1916) discusses Mona Lisa's smile in psychoanalytic terms, a key text in the mythologizing of her smile. These texts built up its apparent importance.  An important event in the building of its modern reputation was its theft from the Louvre in 1911. This event dominated the headlines for a long time, and was even turned into political fodder by the far right, who constructed conspiracy theories about it. Apollinaire was arrested on suspicion of having stolen it; Picasso was also brought in for questioning.  The increasing fame of the painting over the course of the 19th century made it a target for avant-garde parody, culminating in the Duchamp's L.H.O.O.Q, which, combined with its massive reproduction in print media and consumer goods, assured its enormous reputation. Seeing it in the flesh tends to be disappointing; it's small, behind thick glass, and hard to examine in the press of the crowd and through the forest of cell phones. The experience is a far cry from the reputation, which is a result of the painting's contextual history rather than its inherent qualities."

Did you notice how your right hip had to drop down too? And that your left hip had to jut out more to the left? When you do this, your left shoulder should automatically drop a little bit (it keeps your center line, well, in the center). This is the contrapposto.   Ok, now stand straight again. Do you see how much your body has to move to go from one position to the other? Now do the contrapposto pose again, but really exaggerate it. S-curve.  I think that people can sometimes see concepts like this when looking at 'normal' pictures rather than fine art, so compare this image with this. In the first image, the woman is clearly contorting and emphasizing her body. Her shoulders, hips, legs, none of it is symmetrical. Now look at the second picture. Even though the woman has curves and a shape from the cinched waist, her shoulders, hips, and knees are symmetrical. The first woman is standing in an exaggerated contrapposto. The second is standing not. If you can see the difference these photos, you will be able to pick them out in your art history class."

ArtHistory,365w3d,Peteyisthebest,1 point,Sat May 16 13:18:10 2015 UTC,"Is returning Nazi art to the ""rightful heirs"" really the right fate 75 years on? Surely in this era where art is so often hidden from the public the best way we could begin to undo the crimes of the past (inasmuch as art can do so, which is very little) would be to give these invaluable paintings to museums."
ArtHistory,365w3d,durutticolumn,2,Sun May 17 07:33:16 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the right thing to do to ""undo the crimes of the past"" be to return what was stolen to the victim's families? They can then choose to put it in a museum if they want to. What gives anybody else the right to put a ""for the public good"" claim in them?   And art can actually do a lot to undo the crimes of the past."
ArtHistory,365w3d,lauren0526,1 point,Wed May 20 16:21:11 2015 UTC,"The problem is only a small amount of Nazi looted art will ever be found, and art itself represents only a small amount of everything the Nazi's stole from their victims. Therefore giving back the paintings only undoes a tiny fraction of the Nazi crimes, and only benefits the people to whom the art is given - people who at this point are not the ones it was stolen from all those years ago. Putting them in a museum is a public good, so it has the potential to benefit far more people.  If we could go back in time and give back everything the Nazis stole to the people they took it from, that would be justice. But now it's been 75 years and conditions have changed, so our actions should also be different. Giving art to ""rightful heirs"" isn't the most just action, it's just the closest approximation to what would have been the most just action 75 years ago."
ArtHistory,362jrt,alzxx,8,Fri May 15 15:41:00 2015 UTC,"This dissertation probably sound like it doesn't have any potential,   This is a huge topic in art.  Huge.   Frank Stella and Eva Hesse are obviously large portions of this, but people will go back to Malevich and Pollock. In minimalism, this becomes a topic du jour.  I think Jo Baer is probably one of the more interesting artists in this regard in that they always seem to flux subtlety between. The paintings which wrap slightly around the frame, etc. Katharina Grosse. Monochrome painting. Arte Povera. Daniel Buren. Imi Knoebel, Robert Ryman, Blinky Palermo, Dianna Molzan, Stephen Prina, Steven Parrino, Ned Vena, the list is endless.  I would suggest maybe narrowing down the topic.   meant to be a part of an installation (duality in its context)   Maybe you could further explain what you mean by this?"
ArtHistory,362jrt,toadnovak,1 point,Fri May 15 23:32:50 2015 UTC,"Okay wow I didn't expect somebody would actually discuss to me about this, so thank you!!   I guess what I mean by duality in its context is duality in the sense of its purpose, so a painting can be a painting but is actually intended to be viewed as a sculpture/an ""object"" object. For example when I paint, I actually paint for the space. therefore, the painting itself should never be viewed individually, but always as part of the installation that occupies the space.  As for narrowing down the topic, I actually have a particular thought in mind. My favorite artist is Rothko. I have been to the Seagram Murals or the Rothko Room at Tate Modern in London. Being inside the room gave me the most emotional and spiritual experience in my life. I think I am quite interested in the relationship between the room (the space) and Rothko's paintings, how a space can contribute to a work. The room just enveloped me. It added so much to the emotional implications that Rothko had intended the viewers to experience. The grouping/commission of the murals is also important, I think. When they are displayed together, somehow it just exudes so much power. I wonder if I ever view a single Rothko on display somewhere on a gallery, will I stay still and watch the painting for 10 minutes?  I guess, what I'm trying to say is; in this case, Rothko's paintings acted more than just paintings, but as a bigger installation,  a room or a chapel   Does this make any sense? :|"

ArtHistory,362jrt,superusurper,1 point,Mon May 18 13:00:32 2015 UTC,"""Art as experience"" very quickly turns into the spectacle of experience, for me, at least in the context of contemporary art.

ArtHistory,362jrt,fuckinpanduh,2,Tue May 19 01:01:36 2015 UTC,"The zips in Barnett Newman's paintings essentially evolved into sculpture through his Here series.  Looking at his work through a philosophical timeline means delving into some Hegelian theories, but there's a clear trajectory formed--as his ideas become more solidified, they transition from two into three dimensions.   Basically, his painted zips were intended to be considered three-dimensionally as they related to the viewer's understanding of their own existence.   If any of this would be helpful, I've still got a ton of source material bookmarked on the subject."
ArtHistory,362jrt,fixmycupofcaffeine,1 point,Sat May 16 15:36:21 2015 UTC,"Ah! Yes!! This is really helpful! Newman's zips will definitely give me a paragraph of 'how perception can evolve a painting into a sculpture'. Thank you very much. I was wondering though, what do you mean by:   as they related to the viewer's understanding of their own existence.   Is this about the use of the vertical lines?"
ArtHistory,362jrt,fixmycupofcaffeine,1 point,Mon May 18 13:09:41 2015 UTC,"Pretty much!  This is related to Hegel's master-slave dichotomy, wherein one conceptualizes their own existence in contrast to the ""other,"" which is to say the only thing that makes us understand ""self"" is our understanding of ""other.""  Encountering a zip was intended to bring about this realization, i.e. ""here is this thing, therefore I am.""   So in terms of the connection between the zips and the Here series, we have the artist affirming his philosophical intentions by bringing the concept from the ideological (2D) to functional (3D)."

Plus the book has a lot of other essays which might be helpful (Greenberg and Fried are pretty important).  this is an interesting topic. I wish I could help more, but it's not my area of expertise. good luck!"
ArtHistory,362jrt,blackbirdpie,6,Fri May 15 17:28:48 2015 UTC,"Other key essays on Minimalism include Donald Judd's ""Specific Objects,"" Robert Morris' ""Notes On Sculpture,"" and Hal Foster's ""The Crux Of Minimalism.""   If you're thinking about ""what makes a painting a painting"" take a look at the VERY influential essay ""Modernist Painting"" by Clement Greenberg. Greenberg argues that painting has been in the process of purifying itself and becoming most true to itself from the Renaissance onward. What is most essential to painting, for Greenberg, is its opticality and flatness. (Kind of an outdated way of thinking now that's come under a lot of fire, but perhaps interesting to read about and consider in relation to what you're thinking about).   Also check out Leo Steinberg's essay ""Other Criteria"" about Rauschenberg's work. It's a really important essay because it's maybe the first time that ""postmodernism"" was used, but, more useful for you, he talks about how Rauschenberg reoriented painting from vertical to horizontal with his combine works.   In terms of paintings made specifically to be part of an installation, Daniel Buren's Within and Beyond The Frame comes to mind. Buren made a set of identical paintings with stripes, and hung some inside a gallery and some outside across the street. Calls into question what makes a painting a painting in terms of gallery context."

If breasts aren't allowed to be shown on TV, then painted breasts should be no different. If we say they can be shown for ""artistic value"" but no other purpose, that essentially divides all nudity into a binary of art and porn. IMO there should be no problem showing breasts on TV, but so long as they are banned it is hypocritical to selectively censor.  Okay Picasso is so abstract that it's a little absurd in this case, but if they had censored the Venus of Urbino it would probably meet the same outcry."

ArtHistory,35et4m,arklenaut,2,Thu May 28 19:44:14 2015 UTC,"Not too expensive when it comes to learning, compared to going to college in America! But I did need to go to Carrara, italy, (although you could now study under me in Florence if you chose!) get a place for several months, etc... 3,000 dollars in tools and materials will get you all you need for several years' work. Six months' study will give you the skills to be able to do anything you want. It's seriously pretty simple (not necessarily EASY, but simple.). And if you learn how to use a macchinetta a punto (pointing machine, just a simple measuring device), instead of just direct carving, you won't make the kinds of mistakes you talk about.   But here's the big secret that everyone should know - to get a realistic, lifelike, or complex work in stone, you need to do it in clay first, and cast in in plaster. the macchinetta is used to transfer measurements from the plaster to the marble. Think of the clay model as a rough draft in which you make all your mistakes, but because it's clay, you can fix those mistakes. When your clay is perfect, you copy it into marble. No, this is not cheating. The macchinetta has only been around about 300 years, but before that, sculptors were using similar tools for transferring points - Compasses, diffinitore (which Leon Battista Alberti describes in his book On Sculpture, in 1436), and so on. And before anyone says it - yes, even Michelangelo... It took me six months to learn how to carve marble, but ten years of constant study and practice to be able to do good work in clay. Training in clay is easier to find, but GOOD training in clay from someone who actually knows how to use a live model (large amounts of techniques involved with that, more than you would think - just getting someone to pose nude for you is the easy part. How you use your eyes, and the tools which can help your eyes, such as mirrors, plumblines, lighting and environment control, etc. is a whole area of study) is much more rare, and it's what brought me to Florence in the first place.  Sorry for the long answer, I like to demystify what I do as much as possible. This stuff can totally be learned, I teach it all the time, to beginners, who end up pros."

ArtHistory,35diib,puck2,0,Sat May 9 07:09:11 2015 UTC,Very interesting article.  It's something that has always quite amazed me about modern/contemporary art: there's an obvious cult of ugliness but whenever the artists or modern art lovers are confronted to this idea they will generally say it's wrong because beauty doesn't exist or is entirely subjective.  To a certain extent I could understand this point but then why is 'traditional beauty' almost unfindable in modern art? If artists are avoiding it on purpose I think it kinda proves that it exists.

To continue his journey he has to climb down Satan's hairy body towards a tunnel at Satan's feet. Physically he turns around away from the dark and towards the light. But this implies also a 'turning of the soul', literally a conversion. Dante has reached the deepest point of his descent into humility and is now ready to start his upward climb which will ultimately lead him to face God in heaven (or better: beyond heaven). because this is a print and due to the text printed on the sides and upside down the reader actually has to turn the print around himself: making a similar turning/conversion as did Dante."

It's an amazing tool to not only better understand the people and cultures of the past, but it can help us understand our own present.  I'm a docent in an art museum and when I have a group of 10 year old kids my main goal is not that they learn that an old dutch dude painted 'x' painting in 'y' year in 'z' context. It's to get them to connect to the art, to their humanity. If they tell me a crazy story about the painting that art historically speaking doesn't make sense, I'll still be elated because now they've tapped into their creative self and can see themselves in a world with art, in other words, in a world with other humans.   Sometimes the actual art history can be just as effective and I use it when it's appropriate, but cramming facts and dates down someone's throat only further separates people from art.

I have only met one girl who has anything rational and intellectual to say about art and art history. I am subbed to this reddit because I want to actually learn about the history of art and not what I've been ""taught"" (which is nothing that I had not already known). I came into the school with more art history than what seems like anyone else of my peers (and I only started teaching myself a year before acceptance). As for my future, I'm doing my 2nd year at NSCAD next September so I can build up my portfolio before applying to a traditionalist realism school hopefully out in Europe. Seriously, the library is the only good part of that school, and even then it is quite small. I hope you meant THIS level of total honesty. But seriously, at first I thought I was ""into"" conceptual/contemporary art, and now I can't bare to stare at it. Currently I am going through a huge Baroque period because I am taking a summer lighting course so I can understand how to light subjects for future paintings. Education is the key to success, and education in the history of art is something that seems to be lost (in my opinion). Learn art history, love art history, because it can help explain a lot about our world today and where we have come from. (Sorry for my rant)."

I recommend getting the catalogue if these works interest you.   My favourite works were Claes Oldenburg's Proposed Underground Memorial and Tomb for President John F Kennedy ""Before creating his colossal monuments to things like clothes pegs and matches, Oldenburg proposed various memorials. His Proposed Underground Memorial and Tomb for President John F Kennedy called for a huge, hollow casting, based on a photograph of the assassinated president, to be buried head-down in the ground. The statue's size was identical to that of the Statue of Liberty, as if to suggest that Kennedy's murder had turned the American dream on its head. Two decades after his proposal, the idea of evoking tragedy through absence became a major feature of commemorative projects for the Holocaust and civil violence.""  That quote was taken from another article featuring a selection of works from the exhibition  I also loved Theresa Margolles ""Aire/Air"" - a room which only contains a couple of air conditioning units.  ""Vapors are central to several other works in the show. Five portable humidifiers in Teresa Margolles’ “Aire (Air)” emit gentle streams of air moistened, in part, by water that was used to clean corpses in a Mexican morgue. The notion is stirring, but the piece is otherwise mute."" Text taken from here  Lastly I enjoyed the work by Roman Ondak, More Silent Than Ever, from 2006.. A seemingly empty room with a small note on the wall that 'the room contains a small listening device' - once this has been read you are immediately participating in the idea and it's conspiracy.  Not from that exhbition, but the other work I love is Martin Creed WORK NO. 227: THE LIGHTS GOING ON AND OFF. I suppose this could be considered invisible in a way."

On picking artists: I wouldn't say my list of 5 is the most relevant 5 either (I'm hardly qualified to say that) they're mostly just 5 I feel like sharing and have an interesting in relation to each other :) Part of the fun is to hear what artists viewers will comment with; So thanks for sharing!  I'm sure there's many relevant artists that I didn't get to, but I figure I'll have opportunities to talk about them in other topics/videos.  Thanks for your comment!"

ArtHistory,34ku87,enfu3go,2,Sat May 2 01:03:52 2015 UTC,"William Blake's The Great Red Dragon is fairly well known.  A few more from him aren't as popular but just as good.  Could look at Hieronymous Bosch's third panel of The Garden of Earthly Delights depicts Hell and all manner of creatures.  Others: Johannes Sadeler, ""Hell"" 1590 Cornelis Galle I, ""Lucifer"" 1595 Thomas Stothard, ""Satan Summoning His Legions"" 1790 Thomas Lawrence, ""Satan Summoning His Legions"" 1796-97 [Epic, and good for comparison to the one before since they are so different]"

ArtHistory,34e00e,msquared617,6,Thu Apr 30 11:27:59 2015 UTC,"As an archaeologist working on Maya sites in Central America, my experience is that working with galleries outside of the site's country of origin and/or selling to them is absolutely not tolerated. It is considered HIGHLY unethical and is complemented by stringent trafficking laws to prevent it. This sort of open looting and selling to art dealers by archaeologists (at least in my area) is stuff of the 1950s. However, what you do get is looting and sales by non-archaeologists, sometimes called chicleros, who scout out sites and know exactly where to dig to find sellable artifacts. Sometimes these people even work as local manual laborers on university archaeological projects and thereby gain knowledge on how to do this. Are you sure that the middlemen here are archaeologists, and not looters who have worked at sites? I cannot imagine ANY archaeologist today that would consider this ethical. If archaeologists are engaging in this sort of behavior, they are doing it under threat of arrest, etc.   My question to you: do you think it is ethical, as a gallery owner or manager, to be accepting these looted artifacts that are part of the cultural heritage of their countries of origin and otherwise would have been placed in national museums there?"
ArtHistory,34e00e,kingofbeards,3,Thu Apr 30 17:03:15 2015 UTC,"It would completely depend on the item. Moche ceramic studios produced tens of thousands of pots, so I don't see a problem with these being in private collections. I cannot fathom why private collectors would want something like Marajoara funerary urns with people's ashes still lining the interiors.  Peru has definitely had an uphill battle trying to keep even antique paintings from being smuggled out of the country. International transport of antiquities should definitely be regulated.  Tribes should be proactive about educating the public about what items of theirs are collectively owned by the tribe, are too sacred to be considered art, and cannot legally belong to an individual. The Zuni, through their cultural center the A:shiwi A:wan Museum, have been great about this—reaching out to public institutions and educating them about their collections.  There's more justification for public institutions to hold antiquities than there is for private individuals; however, much of public collections comes from donations by private individuals."
ArtHistory,34e00e,thefloorisbaklava,2,Thu Apr 30 16:18:32 2015 UTC,"I've seen a chacmool being bequeath from a privet collection before. The grand daughter of the man was saying it was used for the human scarifies... really was just one for corn and stuff. Freaked me out that they all thought it was used in human scarifies for all those years.   I can't remember what tribe it is but one of their peace pipes in in a museum in France. Each year when the tribe holds a ceremony that the pipe was used in it is returned to them for use. This is one of the best cases I can think of right off where both sides are able to benefit from the object.   Back to bequeathing of collections into public institutions I think this is one of the strongest arguments to allow privet ownership of cultural objects. It allows institutions to acquire objects while not needing to shell out large sums of money to originally buy them. I think the ideas of it being immoral/unethical to own objects is always based off of if its non-wester, and how much a society was repressed. Not saying that is a good reasoning at all, but objects that were taken under more strenuous situations have more restitution issues brought up against them."

ArtHistory,34e00e,miraoister,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:22:34 2015 UTC,"Its illegal in most countries, and under different parts of UNESCO for any country going by those rules."
ArtHistory,34e00e,Just1pin,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:02:19 2015 UTC,"well, one opinion is that if someone pays 100,000 dollars for an ancient item, they will invest time/money in making sure it survives, the item will hopefully be properly examined and catalogued before sale and has a guaranteed long life span."
ArtHistory,34d17v,AutomatedDreamer,3,Thu Apr 30 04:06:53 2015 UTC,"It's called a catalogue raisonné in English. They exist for a few artists in book form. Making a complete catalogue of all the works of a single artist is a huge task that often finds no one willing to do it since very few institutions are willing to fund such research.  Christian Zervos did one for Picasso, there is a famous Miro one also. Paul Klee listed all his works himself which makes it easier."
