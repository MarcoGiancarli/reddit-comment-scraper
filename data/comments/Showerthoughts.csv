Showerthoughts,3e0fy3,FighterPoetThinker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I believe the natural evolution of Batman naturally leads to an Iron Man-esque suit, or at least a suit with heavy levels of technology. I do feel like that origin is a bit of fan service, but I never felt the need for it. I accepted the origin before the Justice League ending and enjoyed the series immensely."

Showerthoughts,3e0fy3,AustinCorgiBart,4,Tue Jul 21 16:23:30 2015 UTC,What about the episode where he has to take out the suit when it's being controlled by the evil AI?
Showerthoughts,3e0fy3,Occasionally_Correct,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:31 2015 UTC,"It felt like an effort to legitimize him. End of the day he was in his late teens when his dad died, went through minimal training and relies on a super suit.  Batman trainer his entire life to achieve the ""pinnacle human"" status in mind and body.  McGinnis never read as worthy to me."
Showerthoughts,3e0fy3,AustinCorgiBart,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get that feeling sometimes too. I think once he decided to take up the mantle, he became more serious. He would never be on Bruce's level, but he did improve a lot. Near the end of the series, there's that ridiculous dinosaur episode - the start of it has Bruce send Terry to get some more serious martial arts training. I imagine that Bruce had Terry really ramp things up with stuff like that. Not for nothing though, in the future, technology plays a huge role in leveling the playing ground. A future batman has to be more reliant and understanding of the technology involved. Terry can get away with being less amazing than Bruce because of that."

I find the whole mythology surrounding superheroes fascinating. Take my favorite superhero, Superman. Not a great comic book, not particularly well-drawn, but the mythology. The mythology is not only great, it’s unique…Now, a staple of the superhero mythology is, there’s the superhero and there’s the alter ego. Batman is actually Bruce Wayne, Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker. When that character wakes up in the morning, he’s Peter Parker. He has to put on a costume to become Spider-Man. And it is in that characteristic Superman stands alone. Superman didn’t become Superman. Superman was born Superman. When Superman wakes up in the morning, he’s Superman. His alter ego is Clark Kent. His outfit with the big red “S”, that’s the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him. Those are his clothes. What Kent wears – the glasses, the business suit – that’s the costume. That’s the costume Superman wears to blend in with us. Clark Kent is how Superman views us. And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent? He’s weak, he’s unsure of himself, he’s a coward. Clark Kent is Superman’s critique on the whole human race."

For two movies we have been waiting for the Bride to find this ""Bill"" and when they finally sit down to chat, he says this.

Those are all qualities he possesses that set him apart from the rest of us. I don't think he resents humans, but he feels that we wouldn't survive without his help. But, if Clark were to act like a hero, superman couldn't come save the day. He doesn't see himself as human, but he does see the inherent good that people are capable of, giving him a reason to believe we are worth saving. Tldr: he is arrogant, but rightfully so."

Showerthoughts,3e0fy3,AFK42,8,Tue Jul 21 12:38:40 2015 UTC,"I don't feel this would be an fair test to determine if Batman's disguise is good enough.   When you see the image, you would be cycling through the famous people of whom you know, who could fit the image.   There is a very small pool of people who it could be, knowing it is most likely going to be a very famous actor.  In the Batman universe, Bruce Wayne, while a millionaire playboy, is arguably not as universally recognizable as Ben Affleck.   This test would have to be the equivalent of picking some random millionaire playboy from New York City, putting him in the suit, and seeing if the average person recognizes him.  I guess Donald Trump might be one of the closest personalities, fame wise, to Bruce Wayne.  He has his name on buildings, his fortune rises and falls, he's a millionaire ... but even that's not exactly a fair test, because I think Trump puts himself out in the media way more than Bruce Wayne does.  Okay... I'm beginning to overthink this.  I digress."

That the actor would be cast (but not made public) and no one would know who he was until he revealed himself as Peter Parker/M.M in CA: Civil War. It would be a surprise in the movie and especially to the audience- seeing as pretty much all other superheroes in the MCU are known to the public (as opposed to in the comic). That way the reveal of Spider-Man would still bare some significance and give a nod to the comic, I think. But no, leaks, leaks, leaks (though this one was announced) is what we see and its so hard to avoid or not want to see. :\"

Or when old people complain about the Asians taking over; they don't mean any Asian in particular, they mean Vietnamese restaurants and Chinese writing and bad driving.  The aliens themselves may be microscopic.  They may be organized like ants, without individual identities.  Or they may be stars themselves.  We'll recognize them by their effects, and that'll depend on tech."

Hormones. All sorts of chemicals etc. since these are directly responsible for our moods and emotions and therefore also our thoughts.   Also. Without our five senses you'd go crazy. Literally

My argument is that in thousands of years,  we have learned all of those aspects of the human brain; including chemical influence and nervous hierarchy.  Maybe we will one day know exactly how the human body exists,  and how our brains function, and will have the knowledge and skills to create a prototype of the human anatomy, physiology and nervous system.  It's far-fetched, but plug in the examples and I'll bet you will feel comfortable with explaining the ancient myths i.e. Anunaki and Sunarian intelligence. Just a fun theory of mine."

Showerthoughts,3e0mdf,brown_felt_hat,106,Tue Jul 21 06:29:54 2015 UTC,"/r/Showerthoughts loves Scooby Doo.   Scooby-Doo taught us that the real monsters always turn out to be humans. The bad guys in Scooby-Doo never invoke their right to remain silent; they always confess their entire plans and motives after they're unmasked. The Scooby-Doo gang must spend a lot of time in court testifying against ""bad guys."" Scooby Doo's ""accent"" makes absolutely no sense. He's capable of making every sound a fluent English speaker can make, just as long as it's not at the beginning of the word. After the police arrest the villains in Scooby Doo, what do they charge them with? The bad guys on Scooby Doo could probably have made more money selling Halloween costumes than trying to pull off their scams. How come in Scooby Doo's Universe monsters and ghost are dismissed as hoaxes yet nobody bats an eye at the talking dog What if Scooby Doo and the gang are the real ghosts and can't rest until they solve the mystery of their own murder? Scooby Doo is CSI for kids. Some company in ""Scooby-Doo"" had to manufacture snacks specifically for Scooby's consumption. Scrappy-Doo is to Scooby-Doo what Jar Jar Binks is to Star Wars Why does Scrappy Doo talk in a normal human voice while Scooby talks in a dog voice? Scooby-doo villains had the best special effects talent of that time period and could have made their fortunes legally. What the fuck kind of name for a dog is ""Scooby Doo""?  In ""Scooby Doo"" the gang isn't really solving mysteries about ghosts, ghouls, etc. They're actually just doing drugs with Shaggy in the Mystery Van and hallucinating their adventures.  Ashton Kutcher would have been a great choice for Shaggy in the live-action Scooby Doo movie. The villains in Scooby-Doo never murdered or stole, they were just really spooky  Scooby Doo's mystery team would have made their lives a lot easier if they decided to crackdown on the kingpin making all those high quality masks for criminals  Maybe the reason law and order, CSI, and other drama mysteries are so popular is because all the people who grew up watching Scooby-Doo...  If someone goes back in time to show the creator of Scooby Doo what they make, and they make Scooby Doo because that person showed them Scooby Doo, where did Scooby Doo start? Is Scooby Doo named after Scooby Snacks or did a company name themselves after him? (self.Showerthoughts) Blues Clues was like the early years/ origin story for Scooby Doo.  Scrappy-doo has Scooby's surname, so his sister most have had him out of wedlock.  Where did the villains in Scooby Doo get all those unique masks?  Courage the Cowardly Dog + That 70s Show = Scooby Doo If I had enough money, I'd build a hospital an Intensive Care Unit and name it Scooby Scooby Doo Why isn't there a children's hospital with a Scooby Doo ICU? Scooby-Doo ultimately teaches kids that people aren't always who they seem, and sometimes the most helpful/friendly are also the most sinister. Why don't they sell Scooby Doo villains as Halloween costumes Carrie is to Matilda what X-Files is to Scooby-Doo. Scooby doo and the Mystery gang have been on and off the air, since 69 and would be senior citizens now Velma from Scooby Doo should really look into getting contacts Criminals in the Scooby-Doo universe go to jail for wearing costumes and scaring people.....harsh. If Scooby-Doo eats Scooby-Snacks, he'll still ultimately make Scooby-Doo.  ""Scooby Doobie Doo"" is a strong hint at Scooby and Shaggy's frequent marijuana use  If there were an episode of Scooby Doo where the ""main suspect"" actually ended up being the monster, it would be the biggest plot twist ever.  In Scooby Doo, the paranormal crime always turns out to be a dude in suit. In the X-files, the 'normal' crime always turns out to be freaky shit. In Scooby Doo, no-one reads the criminals their Miranda Rights.  Many of the villains from Scooby-Doo would be extremely rich if they patented the technology in their costumes. The story of the Disney movie Bighero is just a generic plot of Scooby doo.  Considering every supernatural element the Scooby-Doo team uncover is in fact mundane, that talking dog they have with them must just be an old guy in a costume  Scooby-Doo and the gang were most likely high on acid for every episode until the end. Why didn't they name Scooby Doo a word he could pronounce? A cabin in the woods is scooby doo but scooby is a black dude TV shows like NCIS or CSI are basically the grown-up versions of Scooby Doo  Since Great Danes have shorter life spans, what if every iteration of Scooby Doo is just another Scrappy Doo grown up. Doctor who is the opposite of scooby-doo. Throughout the course of their adventures, the Scooby Doo Gang apprehends HUNDREDS of deranged, psychopathic criminals. They could realistically be a special police task force. Just realized the television show ""Psyche"" is just Scooby Doo for grown ups.  Scooby Doo is about hipsters unmasking crooks using supernatural or monster costumes that terrify the gang... With the help of a conscious talking dog.  Scooby Doo is supposed to teach children not to be afraid of monsters by revealing the villain as a person at the end. Essentially, it's just teaching children to be afraid of other people. Scooby Doo teaches kids that everything supernatural or otherworldly Is just some asshole trying to scare you so they can make some money Scooby-Doo was a show about functional meddling kids that kept actual kids from meddling Scooby Doo's catch phrase was Hanna-Barbera's own nod to their longest running primetime cartoon, The Flintstones. Scooby's name in Scooby Doo is derived from the word dooby.  There should be a YouTube artist who's ""thing"" is finishing fake songs that appear in other media. (i.e. The Spice Girls from Scooby-Doo, Genovia's national anthem)  Technically, Scooby Doo was the first Snoop Dogg.  If it wasn't for society/media, would cemeteries be scary? Every episode from 'Scooby Doo' ends with a plot twist Gilligan, from Gilligan's Island, makes me think of Scooby-Doo as a human.  House is like the adult version of Scooby Doo as far as mystery solving tv shows go  Scooby-Doo is the only one in the 1969 series with eyes that aren't 100% pupil.  Scooby-Doo teaches us that humans are scarier than any monster we could make up  Scooby Doo, Shaggy and the rest of the gang must have to testify in court a lot.  Why doesn't Velma from Scooby Doo just get contacts?  Shaggy from Scooby-doo sounds like fucky in the UK At the end of Scooby-Doo, the villain always get's arrested, although they've never actually broken the law. Nintendo should team up with whoever owns Scooby Doo now, and create a Luigi's mansion crossover! Some Scooby-Doo mysteries would make great cases in an Ace Attorney game  What if the guys from Scooby Doo caught a guy dressing up as a monster which actually existed, but they just caught the guy. Scooby do made us watch crime shows The X-Files is just Scooby-Doo for adults The Scream movies are just adult versions of Scooby Doo mysteries  Why did Scooby Doo have a talking dog, but never real ghosts?  Scooby Doo has lived a lot longer more than most dogs. Scooby Doo would make a great lead singer for a Deathcore band.  Bruce willis in Die Hard is kind of like Scooby Doo-team. If it wasn't for you, I would have made it The X-files is essentially Scooby Doo in reverse. Velma from Scooby-Doo is in the perfect position to commit the crime.  What if the Scooby Doo show takes place in a psychiatric asylum where they have an imaginary talking dog that helps solve puzzles they can't solve on their own?  What if Scooby Doo and Gang were better investigators than Mulder and Scully, and that's why they got to the bottom of all their supernatural cases?  90% of Scooby Doo villains were less harmful to their ""victims"" than the average prank video on YouTube The X-Files was one, long Scooby Doo episode. Like the most recent Scooby-Doo movie, the Teenage Mutant Turtles Movie is the retro film I'm supposed to want to see, but whose series I never actually liked  In the Scooby Doo movie ""Zombie Island"", Shaggy and Scooby get caught eating all the contraband cheese while at work. The cheese contraband was just substitute for Shaggy and Scooby smoking contraband at work. If every dog in the world turned into Scooby Doo. We'd never face fear again. Except by talking dogs. Every episode of Scooby Doo is like a cartoon version of the reality TV show, Catfish.  Most Scooby Doo mysteries could have been solved immediately if Scooby had attacked the monster and ripped its head off Scooby-Doo's scooby snacks are the equivalent of Popeye's spinach  Shaggy and Scooby-Doo were always craving Scooby snacks because they were high and had the munchies. if scooby doo had been named scoopy doo that show would have been a lot different  A t.v. show featuring a dog detective (like Scooby-Doo), but voiced by Snoop Dogg.  It's actually kind of... Sad? I guess? that Scooby Doo doesn't realize he's a dog.  In Scooby Doo, Shaggy eats dog treats for snacks. Someone should make a Scooby Doo themed restaurant review site named Relp.  How come Scooby Doo never got the shits? All he eats is burgers etc  Hawaii Five O is basically Scooby Doo for adults Muppet Babies, Scooby Doo Kids, Flintstone Kids, but no Golden Girls Babies? Where same actresses crawl around in nothing but diapers? Shaggy from Scooby Doo is a total pothead. Not only does he look and dress like one, but his best friend's a talking dog, he always has the munchies, and he's always paranoid."

Let's take it to the NIST agent Charles Bradly, Charles?""  Bradly: ""Yes, thank you sharron. Just recently we have created a full 92 page report about the fall of the WTC 7, but here is the jist of it: The story goes that on 9/11, professional eater Jason Hobbs was walking from the 7/11 to WTC 7 to work at his office in the 37th floor. Hobbs says that after microwaving some taquitos that were purchased at the 7/11 down the street, Hobbs began feeling irrational bowel movement. Hobbs: 'It just felt like the world was coming down, ya know? It felt like I was shitting out my intestines. I got up to look at the toilet and noticed a smoke plume was piling out from the shitter I was deficating in.' We at NIST believe this is the point where the hot shits from the 7/11 taquitos first infiltrated the piping system. We recovered the toilet miraculously buried underneath the rubble of the building. We discovered that the interior lining of the toilet, believed to be used by Jason Hobbs on that fateful day, was completely melted away. After further analysis, we discovered radioactive ceramic ions within the tubing of the toilet, as well as aluminum oxide in the piping system directly near it. Alluminum iodine is created when steel melts into its liquid form. We confirmed that the volcanic shits that were coming from Mr. Hobbs had allowed this chemical reaction with the oxygen in the air to take place, which created fires that burned and melted the steel structures at tempuratures of between 3400-3600 degrees farenheight. Hobbs confirmed that he had stayed on that shitter for a whopping 6 1/2 hours before finally exiting the building, being the last to do so. He said his asshole was sore for the next month, but all in all, the taquitos were certainly worth it. This is Charles Bradley, NIST."""

So during the movie, you still suck and suck on your straw to drink up these last drops, which somehow miraculously reappear. You'll notice that the taste of coke vanishes and more and more the remaining drops taste bland, but cold and refreshing. Not sweet, not sour, not bitter, sometimes just a bit of a metallic taste, that's what water tastes like."

This is bullshit way of convincing someone. Alternatively you say ""the taste of water is lack of taste at all"", which is kind of makes more sense than your first argument, but still is kind of bullshit.

Showerthoughts,3e2h8r,Jehovacoin,2,Tue Jul 21 15:04:08 2015 UTC,"no, you dont like spiders because your animal brain does not like them.  your animal brain does not like them because our ancestors had some real issues with spiders resulting in death and painfull things..   basicly, monkey ancestor human learned spiders are bad mkay.  spiders are FAR more afraid of crawling down your behind then you are of them doing that."
Showerthoughts,3e2h8r,InkMercenary,2,Tue Jul 21 14:55:26 2015 UTC,"Actually evolution doesn't happen like that. Monkeys don't evolve to be afraid of spiders because spiders hurt them or kill them. It probably happened that most monkeys were not afraid of insects at all, and one day a group of monkeys were born who had an instinctual fear of creepy-crawly's. Over a long period of time, the genetic line that was afraid of the creepy-crawly died less because they avoided harmful poison and toxins, therefore the instinct was passed on to more offspring.   Evolution is random, not learned. It just seems like the effect is the cause sometimes."
